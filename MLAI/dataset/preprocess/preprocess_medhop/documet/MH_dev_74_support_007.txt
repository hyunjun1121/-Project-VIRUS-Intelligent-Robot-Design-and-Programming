Expression of two variants of the human mu opioid receptor mRNA in SK-N-SH cells and human brain . A partial mu opioid receptor gene was isolated from a human genomic library using a mouse delta opioid receptor cDNA as a probe . Using information from this genomic clone and the published human mu receptor , P35372 , a cDNA was isolated from SK-N-SH mRNA that codes for a variant of the P35372 mRNA , MOR1A . The presence of MOR1A is also shown in human brain using RT-PCR . MOR1A differs from P35372 in that the 3' terminal intron has not been removed . An in-frame termination codon is found four amino acids after the 5' consensus splice site , making MOR1A eight amino acids shorter than P35372 . Both receptors show similar ligand binding and coupling to DB02527 in CHO- P04264 cells . The C-terminal differences between P35372 and MOR1A could have effects on receptor coupling or receptor transport and localization .
