Silencing of ALA dehydratase affects ALA-photodynamic therapy efficacy in K562 erythroleukemic cells . Synthesis of protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) by malignant cells is essential for the success of ALA-based photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . Two key enzymes that were described as affecting PpIX accumulation during ALA treatment are porphobilinogen deaminase ( P08397 ) and ferrochelatase . Here , we show that down regulation of ALA dehydratase ( P13716 ) expression and activity by specific shRNA induced a marked decrease in PpIX synthesis in K562 erythroleukemic cells . Photo-inactivation efficacy following DB00855 was directly correlated with P13716 -silencing and cellular levels of PpIX . MTT metabolism following DB00855 was shown to be 60 % higher in P13716 -silenced cells in comparison to control cells , indicating that mitochondria were protected in the silenced cells . Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) of cells treated by DB00855 showed no morphological changes in P13716 -silenced cells , in contrast to controls exhibiting cell deformations and lysis . Membrane integrity following DB00855 was kept intact and undamaged in P13716 -silenced cells as examined by P08758 -FITC/PI staining and LDH-L leakage . We conclude that P13716 , although it is present in the cell at abundant levels , has a major and limiting role in regulating PpIX synthesis and DB00855 outcome .
