DB00731 and mitiglinide , but not sulfonylureas , induce insulin secretion through a mechanism mediated by calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum . DB00731 and mitiglinide ( glinides ) are characterized as rapid-onset and short-acting insulinotropic agents . Although both compounds do not have a sulfonylurea structure , it has been postulated that insulin secretion is preceded by their binding to Kir6.2/ Q09428 complex , and a mechanism of insulin secretion of glinides has been accounted for by this pathway . However , we hypothesized the involvement of additional mechanisms of insulin secretion enhanced by glinides , and we analyzed the pattern of time course of insulin secretion from MIN6 cells with the existence of agents that have specific pharmacologic actions . Dose-dependent effects of tolbutamide , glibenclamide , nateglinide , and mitiglinide were observed . P01308 secretion induced by 3 microM tolbutamide and 1 nM glibenclamide was completely inhibited by 10 microM diazoxide and 3 microM verapamil , although the latter half-component of insulin secretion profile induced by 3 microM nateglinide or 30 nM mitiglinide remained with the existence of those agents . Glinides enhanced insulin secretion even in Ca2+-depleted medium , and its pattern of secretion was same as the pattern with existence of verapamil . The latter half was suppressed by 1 microM dantrolene , and concomitant addition of verapamil and dantrolene completely suppressed the entire pattern of insulin secretion enhanced by nateglinide . Thus , we conclude that glinide action is demonstrated through two pathways , dependently and independently , from the pathway through K( DB00171 ) channels . We also demonstrated that the latter pathway involves the intracellular calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptor activation .
