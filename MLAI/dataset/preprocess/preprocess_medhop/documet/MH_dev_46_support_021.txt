DB06698 ameliorates olanzapine-induced weight gain through modulation of histaminergic , P01303 and AMPK pathways . Olanzapine is widely used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders , but causes adverse obesity and other metabolic side-effects . Both animal and clinical studies have shown that co-treatment with betahistine ( a histaminergic H1 receptor agonist and H3 receptor antagonist ) is effective for ameliorating olanzapine-induced weight gain/obesity . To reveal the mechanisms underlying these effects , this study investigated the effects of co-treatment of olanzapine and betahistine ( O+B ) on expressions of histaminergic H1 receptor ( P35367 ) , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , and proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) in the hypothalamus associated with reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain . Olanzapine significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of P35367 , while O+B co-treatment significantly downregulated the P35367 levels , compared to the olanzapine-only treatment group . The P01303 mRNA expression was significantly enhanced by olanzapine , but it was significantly reversed by O+B co-treatment . The hypothalamic P35367 expression was positively correlated with total food intake , and P01303 expression . Olanzapine also increased AMPKα activation measured by the AMPKα phosphorylation ( pAMPKα ) /AMPKα ratio compared with controls , whereas O+B co-treatment decreased the pAMPKα/AMPKα ratio , compared with olanzapine only treatment . The pAMPKα/AMPKα ratio was positively correlated with total food intake and P35367 expression . Although olanzapine administration decreased the P01189 mRNA level , this level was not affected by O+B co-treatment . Therefore , these results suggested that co-treatment with betahistine may reverse olanzapine-induced body weight gain via the P35367 - P01303 and P35367 -pAMPKα pathways .
