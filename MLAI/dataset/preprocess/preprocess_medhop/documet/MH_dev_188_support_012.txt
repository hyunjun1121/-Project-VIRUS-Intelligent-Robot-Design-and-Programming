HRAS1 and P01308 genes are relocated but not structurally altered as a result of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) in a clone from a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia ( M4 ) . A patient whose leukaemic cells carried the rare t(7;11)(p15;p15) was diagnosed as having acute myelomonocytic leukaemia ( AML-M4 ) , and supports the association of this specific translocation with forms of acute myeloid leukaemia showing differentiation . Blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia was excluded by lack of involvement of the P00519 and P11274 genes . Chromosome in situ hybridization studies showed that both the HRAS1 and P01308 genes were present on the terminal part of chromosome 11p which was translocated to chromosome 7p . Neither HRAS1 nor P01308 were structurally rearranged . Field inversion gel electrophoresis showed that a 400 kb fragment encompassing HRAS1 was structurally entire in leukaemic DNA . Because the P01308 gene , which was also translocated , is probably located proximal to HRAS1 on chromosome 11p , it is unlikely that HRAS1 was near the chromosome 11 breakpoint or involved in this leukaemia .
