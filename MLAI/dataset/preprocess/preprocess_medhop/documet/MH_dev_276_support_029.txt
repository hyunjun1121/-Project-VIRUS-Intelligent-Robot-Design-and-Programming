Human oviductal gonadotropin-releasing hormone : possible implications in fertilization , early embryonic development , and implantation . The oviduct is host to gametes and early embryos at a critical point in their lives . It is clear that the interactions of gametes/early embryo with the maternal oviduct in an autocrine and paracrine manner provide a microenvironment that enhances fertilization , early embryonic development , and implantation . Moreover , there is considerable evidence that an extrahypothalamic DB00644 may play a substantial role as a molecular autocrine/paracrine regulator in these events . Gametes and preimplantation embryos express DB00644 and P30968 at both messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein levels . However , whether DB00644 is produced by the human oviduct has not yet been demonstrated . We used RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques to investigate DB00644 mRNA and protein expression in human fallopian tubes throughout the menstrual cycle of premenopausal fertile patients . Our results , at both the mRNA and protein levels , revealed cycle-dependent production of an oviductal DB00644 with expression during the luteal phase . Moreover , DB00644 immunostaining was localized in the tubal epithelium during the luteal phase . On the basis of these data , we suggest that during reproductive life , oviductal DB00644 may play a substantial paracrine/autocrine role in human fertilization , early embryonic development , and implantation .
