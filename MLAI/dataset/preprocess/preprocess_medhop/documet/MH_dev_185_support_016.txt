AMPA-kainate subtypes of glutamate receptor in rat cerebral microglia . Microglial cells were isolated from rat cerebral cortex , and kainate ( KA ) -induced inward current was measured at a holding potential of -40 or -60 mV . 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2 , 3-dione-sensitive KA-induced currents increased with increasing KA concentration . The half-activation concentration and Hill coefficient were 3.3 x 10(-4) M and 1.4 , respectively . Although glutamate ( DB00142 ) and AMPA-induced currents were much smaller than that induced by KA , all KA- , DB00142 - , and AMPA-induced currents were greatly and consistently enhanced in the presence of cyclothiazide ( CTZ ) . On the other hand , KA-induced currents were much less sensitive to potentiation by concanavain A , suggesting that the KA-induced response in rat microglia is predominantly mediated by AMPA-preferring receptors ( subunits GluR1- P48058 ) . The current-voltage relationships of KA- and AMPA-CTZ-induced currents were almost linear or slightly outward rectifying . The reversal potential of KA-induced current shifted to negative potentials ( from +4 to -40 mV ) on switching from high Na(+) to high Ca(2+) external solution , indicating the low Ca(2+) permeability through the AMPA-KA receptor channel complexes . AMPA-KA receptor expression was studied with immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR , from which GluR2 , GluR3 , P48058 , and P39086 were identified . Lower levels of mRNAs for Q13003 and KA-1-KA-2 were also indicated . Finally , activation of these receptors with KA or DB00142 significantly enhanced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha . These results suggest that primary cultured rat microglia possesses functional DB00142 receptor , which may mediate neuron to microglia communication in the physiological and pathological states .
