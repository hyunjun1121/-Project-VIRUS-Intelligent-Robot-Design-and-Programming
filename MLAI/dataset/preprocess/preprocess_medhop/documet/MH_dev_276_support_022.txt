Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulators ( SPPARMα ) : the next generation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-agonists . Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular ( CV ) disease - the primary cause of death , worldwide . Although reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol can significantly reduce CV risk , a high level of residual risk persists , especially in people with obesity-related conditions , such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus . Q07869 - ( PPARα- ) agonists ( e.g. fibrates ) , play a central role in the reduction of macro- and microvascular risk in these patients . However , the currently available fibrates are weak ( PPARα-agonists ) with limited efficacy due to dose-related adverse effects . To address this problem , a new generation of highly potent and selective PPARα-modulators ( SPPARMα ) is being developed that separate the benefits of the PPARα-agonists from their unwanted side effects . Among these , aleglitazar ( a dual PPARα/γ agonist ) and DB05187 ( a dual Q07869 α/δ agonist ) have recently entered late-phase development . Although both compounds are more potent PPARα-activators than fenofibrate in vitro , only aleglitezar is more effective in lowering triglycerides and raising high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C ) in humans . However , it is also associated with a potential risk of adverse effects . More recently , a highly potent , specific PPARα-agonist ( K-877 ) has emerged with SPPARMα characteristics . Compared to fenofibrate , K-877 has more potent PPARα-activating efficacy in vitro , greater effects on triglycerides- and HDL-C levels in humans , and a reduced risk of adverse effects . If successful , K-877 has the potential to supersede the fibrates as the treatment of choice for patients with residual CV risk associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes .
