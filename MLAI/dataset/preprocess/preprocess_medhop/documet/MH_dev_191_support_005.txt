Modeling of Q14654 and inhibition mechanism of the natural ligand , ellagic acid , using molecular docking . Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which blood sugar ( glucose ) levels are abnormally high because the body does not produce enough insulin to meet its needs . Post-prandial hyperglycemia ( PPHG ) is an independent risk factor for the development of macro vascular complications . It is now recognized that normalizing post-prandial blood glucose is more difficult than normalizing fasting glucose . DB01345 channels are the most widely distributed type of ion channel and are found in virtually all living organisms . The function of KATP channels is best understood in pancreatic beta cells , the membrane potential of which is responsive to external glucose concentration . Beta cells show a remarkably complex electrical bursting behavior in response to an increase in glucose level . DB00731 and DB00222 are a class of insulin secretagog agents that lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreas . These compounds interact with the DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K+ DB00171 ) channel in pancreatic beta cells . However , the side effects of these drugs overpass their uses , and the need to identify compounds with less adverse effects is exigent . In our research study , we used the natural compound ellagic acid , which is an already proven anti-carcinogen , anti-mutagen , and anticancer initiator , for its anti-diabetic activity in comparison to the two commercial drugs ( DB00731 and DB00222 ) . The drugs and the compounds were docked to the DB00171 -dependent potassium channel and their energy value showed that the compound had higher binding value than the commercial drugs . Then an ADME/Tox analysis for the compound was carried out which showed that ellagic can be a possible lead molecule .
