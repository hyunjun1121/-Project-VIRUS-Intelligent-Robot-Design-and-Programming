Dopamine receptor D4 polymorphism predicts the effect of DB01235 on gambling behavior . BACKGROUND : There is ample evidence that a subgroup of Parkinson 's disease patients who are treated with dopaminergic drugs develop certain behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling . The fact that only a subgroup of these patients develops pathological gambling suggests an interaction between dopaminergic drug treatment and individual susceptibility factors . These are potentially of genetic origin , since research in healthy subjects suggests that vulnerability for pathological gambling may be linked to variation in the dopamine receptor D4 ( P21917 ) gene . Using a pharmacogenetic approach , we investigated how variation in this gene modulates the impact of dopaminergic stimulation on gambling behavior in healthy subjects . METHODS : We administered 300 mg of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DB01235 ) or placebo to 200 healthy male subjects who were all genotyped for their P21917 polymorphism . Subjects played a gambling task 60 minutes after DB01235 administration . RESULTS : Without considering genetic information , DB01235 administration did not lead to an increase in gambling propensity compared with placebo . As expected , however , an individual 's P21917 polymorphism accounted for variation in gambling behavior after the administration of DB01235 . Subjects who carry at least one copy of the 7-repeat allele showed an increased gambling propensity after dopaminergic stimulation . CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that genetic variation in the P21917 gene determines an individual 's gambling behavior in response to a dopaminergic drug challenge . They may have implications for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease patients by offering a genotype approach for determining individual susceptibilities for pathological gambling and may also afford insights into the vulnerability mechanisms underlying addictive behavior .
