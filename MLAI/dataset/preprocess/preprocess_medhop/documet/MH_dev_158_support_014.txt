DB04866 improves muscle-cell survival in muscular dystrophies . DB04866 has been shown to prevent fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-β/ P84022 pathway in muscular dystrophies . We hypothesized that halofuginone would reduce apoptosis -- the presumed cause of satellite-cell depletion during muscle degradation-in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy . Six-week-old mdx mouse diaphragm exhibited fourfold higher numbers of apoptotic nuclei compared with wild-type mice as determined by a TUNEL assay . Apoptotic nuclei were found in macrophages and in Pax7-expressing cells ; some were located in centrally-nucleated regenerating myofibers . DB04866 treatment of mdx mice reduced the apoptotic nuclei number in the diaphragm , together with reduction in Bax and induction in Bcl2 levels in myofibers isolated from these mice . A similar effect was observed when halofuginone was added to cultured myofibers . No apparent effect of halofuginone was observed in wild-type mice . Inhibition of apoptosis or staurosporine-induced apoptosis by halofuginone in mdx primary myoblasts and P06681 myogenic cell line , respectively , was reflected by less pyknotic/apoptotic cells and reduced Bax expression . This reduction was reversed by a phosphinositide-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase inhibitors , suggesting involvement of these pathways in mediating halofuginone 's effects on apoptosis . DB04866 increased apoptosis in α smooth muscle actin- and prolyl 4-hydroxylase β-expressing cells in mdx diaphragm and in myofibroblasts , the major source of extracellular matrix . The data suggest an additional mechanism by which halofuginone improves muscle pathology and function in muscular dystrophies .
