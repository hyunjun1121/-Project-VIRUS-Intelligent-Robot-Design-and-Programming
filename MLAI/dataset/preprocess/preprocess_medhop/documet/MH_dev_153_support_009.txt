The development of DB01276 ( exenatide ) from the venom of the Gila monster as an anti-diabetic agent . The development of DB01276 ( synthetic exendin-4 ; exenatide ) as a treatment of diabetes arose from two , parallel lines of investigation . The development of the ' incretin concept ' which hypothesised that hormones from the gut contributed to the insulin secretion in response to meals , led to the identification of glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P0C6A0 ) as an important ' incretin ' hormone . P0C6A0 not only increases insulin secretion but increases Î²-cell proliferation and survival , suppresses glucagon secretion , delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite , all of these actions contributing to a potential anti-diabetic effect . However , P0C6A0 has a very short half due to its rapid breakdown by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ectopeptidases . A systematic investigation of the composition and activity of venom from the Gila monster , Heloderma suspectum , led to the isolation of a 39-amino acid peptide , designated exendin-4 , showing 53 % structural homology with P0C6A0 (7-36) . Exendin-4 mimicked P0C6A0 through stimulating the P43220 . The much greater stability of exendin-4 led to its experimental and clinical evaluation as an anti-diabetic agent and its introduction to the market in 2005 .
