Efficacy of infliximab in a patient with refractory idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis . Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis ( Q969Q1 ) . However , relapses are frequent upon tapering of the glucocorticoid dose . A variety of traditional immunosuppressants have been proposed as steroid-sparing agents , but some patients fail to adequately respond to combined glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy . We report a patient with Q969Q1 refractory to combined glucocorticoid and methotrexate therapy treated with the anti- P01375 -Î± monoclonal antibody infliximab . DB00065 was administered at 5 mg/kg/bodyweight at week 0 , 2 , 6 and 8-weekly thereafter for 3 consecutive years . Drug efficacy and safety were assessed clinically and by laboratory tests at treatment onset and subsequently before each infusion . In addition , 18FFluorodeoxyglucose ( DB09150 ) positron emission computerised tomography ( PET/CT ) and abdominal CT scans were used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment . DB00065 therapy resulted in a satisfactory clinical and laboratory response paralleled by an improvement in imaging findings . No serious adverse events were noted . DB00065 may be an effective and safe treatment for refractory Q969Q1 . A controlled study is required to confirm our findings .
