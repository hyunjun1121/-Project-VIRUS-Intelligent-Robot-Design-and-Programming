Upregulation of cell-surface-associated plasminogen activation in cultured keratinocytes by interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha . Keratinocytes synthesize and secrete urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) which is bound in an autocrine manner to a specific receptor ( uPA-R ) at the keratinocyte surface . P00747 that is also bound to specific membrane binding sites is readily activated by uPA-R-bound uPA . Thus , plasmin is provided for proteolysis of pericellular glycoproteins . The expression of uPA and the uPA-R is confined to migrating keratinocytes during epidermal wound healing , rather than to keratinocytes of the normal epidermis . The regulatory factors of uPA/uPA-R expression in keratinocytes remained largely elusive . Proinflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) or interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) , are present in epidermal wounds . We have therefore tested P01584 and P01375 for their influence on surface-associated plasminogen activation in a human keratinocyte cell line ( HaCaT ) as well as in primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes . Both cytokines induced the secretion of uPA into the culture supernatants and a concomitant increase in uPA activity as well as in uPA and uPA-R antigen at the cell surface . The increase was preceded by an increase in specific mRNA . The induction was accompanied by an accelerated uPA-dependent and plasmin-mediated detachment of HaCaT cells from the culture substratum . Taken together , the proinflammatory cytokines P01584 and P01375 induced a coordinated increase in uPA and uPA-R as well as increased pericellular plasmin-mediated proteolysis in human epidermal keratinocytes . This function might be an element of the molecular cell biological events during epidermal wound healing .
