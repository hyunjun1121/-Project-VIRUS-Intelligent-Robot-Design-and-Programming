A triple combination of atorvastatin , celecoxib and tipifarnib strongly inhibits pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft pancreatic tumors . Because K-Ras mutation and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) overexpression are hallmarks of majority of pancreatic cancer patients , an approach to inhibit the progression and growth of pancreatic cancer using the simultaneous administration of agents that inhibit the function of both targets , should be considered . In the present study , we assessed the effects of atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) , celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and tipifarnib ( DB04960 ) on the growth of human pancreatic cancer . In the in vitro studies , we found that treatment of human pancreatic tumor cells with a combination of atorvastatin , celecoxib and tipifarnib had a stronger inhibitory effect on growth and a stronger stimulatory effect on apoptosis than each drug alone or for any combination of two drugs . We also found that treatment of Panc-1 cells with a combination of all three drugs strongly decreased the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and Akt . In an animal model of xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice , we found that daily i.p. injections of a combination of atorvastatin , celecoxib and tipifarnib had a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of the tumors in mice than each drug alone or for any combination of two drugs . The results of our study indicate that a combination of atorvastatin , celecoxib and tipifarnib may be an effective strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer .
