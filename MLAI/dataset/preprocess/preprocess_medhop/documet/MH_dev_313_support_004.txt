CCK1-receptor stimulation protects against gut mediator-induced lung damage during endotoxemia . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Cholecystokinin 1-receptor ( P32238 ) activation by long chain fatty acid ( LCFA ) absorption stimulates vago-vagal reflex pathways in the brain stem . The present study determines whether this reflex also activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway , a pathway known to modulate cytokine release during endotoxemia . METHODS : Mesenteric lymph was obtained from wild type ( WT ) and P32238 knockout ( P32238 (-/-) ) mice intraperitoneally challenged with Lipopolysaccharid ( LPS ) ( endotoxemic lymph , EL ) and intestinally infused with vehicle or LCFA-enriched solution . The lymph was analyzed for TNFα , P05231 and P22301 concentration and administered to healthy recipient mice via jugular infusion . Alveolar wall thickness , myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) and TUNEL positive cells were determined in lung tissue of recipient mice . RESULTS : LCFA infusion in WT mice reduced TNFα concentration in EL by 49 % compared to vehicle infusion , but had no effect in P32238 (-/-) mice . EL significantly increased the alveolar wall thickness , the number of P05164 -positive and TUNEL-positive cells compared to control lymph administration . LCFA infusion in WT , but not in CCK1R(-/-) mice , significantly reduced these pathological effects of EL . CONCLUSION : During endotoxemia enteral LCFA absorption reduces TNFα release into mesenteric lymph and attenuates histomorphologic parameters of lung dysfunction . Failure to elicit this effect in CCK1R(-/-) mice demonstrates that anti-inflammatory properties of LCFAs are mediated through CCK1-Rs .
