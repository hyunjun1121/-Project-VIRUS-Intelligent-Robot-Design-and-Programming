Integrating bevacizumab , everolimus , and lapatinib into current neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for primary breast cancer . Safety results of the GeparQuinto trial . BACKGROUND : Safety data for combining bevacizumab , everolimus , or lapatinib with anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are limited . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The neoadjuvant GeparQuinto trial investigates the addition of ( i ) bevacizumab to four cycles epirubicin/cyclophosphamide ( EC ) followed by four cycles docetaxel ( Taxotere ) in patients with human epithelial growth factor receptor (HER)2-negative tumors , ( ii ) everolimus to weekly paclitaxel in patients with P04626 -negative tumors not responding to EC Â± bevacizumab , and ( iii ) lapatinib instead of trastuzumab to EC-docetaxel in patients with P04626 -positive tumors to improve the rate of pathological complete response . Tolerable dose , need for supportive treatments , and early signals for toxic effect were evaluated in a planned safety analysis of 270 patients . RESULTS : Treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab , everolimus , or lapatinib was discontinued in 23.0 % , 25.8 % , and 34.5 % compared with chemotherapy alone or plus trastuzumab in 19.4 % , 24.1 % , 3.2 % , respectively . More leukopenia , infections , mucositis , and hypertension but less edema was observed by adding bevacizumab ; a trend toward more thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , skin changes , and hyperlipidemia by adding everolimus ; and more diarrhea , skin changes , and hot flushes but no cardiac events by substituting trastuzumab by lapatinib . CONCLUSIONS : Adding bevacizumab and everolimus to chemotherapy appeared feasible . DB01259 at 1250 mg resulted in an increased rate of treatment discontinuations and was subsequently dose reduced to 1000 mg .
