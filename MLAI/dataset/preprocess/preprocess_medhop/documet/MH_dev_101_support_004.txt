Requirement and epigenetics reprogramming of Nrf2 in suppression of tumor promoter TPA-induced mouse skin cell transformation by sulforaphane . Nrf2 is a transcription factor that plays critical roles in regulating the expression of cellular defensive antioxidants and detoxification enzymes . However , the role of Nrf2 and Nrf2 's epigenetics reprogramming in skin tumor transformation is unknown . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory role and epigenetics of Nrf2 on tumor transformation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) in mouse skin epidermal JB6 ( JB6 P+ ) cells and the anticancer effect of sulforaphane ( SFN ) , an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables . After five days of treatment , SFN significantly inhibited TPA-induced JB6 cellular transformation and SFN enhanced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased the mRNA and protein levels of the Nrf2 target genes P09601 , P15559 and P22309 . Knockdown of Nrf2 attenuated the induction of Nrf2 , P09601 and P15559 by SFN , enhanced TPA-induced colony formation and dampened the inhibitory effect of SFN on TPA-induced JB6 transformation . Epigenetics investigation using bisulfite genomic sequencing showed that SFN decreased the methylation ratio of the first 15 CpGs of the Nrf2 gene promoter , which was corroborated by increased Nrf2 mRNA expression . Furthermore , SFN strongly reduced the protein expression of DNA methyltransferases ( P26358 , DNMT3a and DNMT3b ) . SFN also inhibited the total histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity and decreased the protein expression of Q13547 , Q92769 , O15379 and P56524 . Collectively , these results suggest that the anti-cancer effect of SFN against TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of mouse skin could involve the epigenetic reprogramming of anti-cancer genes such as Nrf2 , leading to the epigenetic reactivation of Nrf2 and the subsequent induction of downstream target genes involved in cellular protection .
