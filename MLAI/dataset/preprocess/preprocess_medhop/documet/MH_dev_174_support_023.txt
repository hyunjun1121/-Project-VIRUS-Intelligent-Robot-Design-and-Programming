Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 as a secreted biomarker for human ovarian cancer promotes cancer cell proliferation . Ovarian cancers are frequently not diagnosed until advanced stages , resulting in a high case fatality rate . Because of this , more tumor markers , in addition to Q8WXI7 , for detecting and monitoring ovarian cancer are needed . During a systematic search for potential biomarkers of ovarian cancer , we compared the protein profiles between tumor interstitial fluid and normal interstitial fluid of ovaries , rationalizing that abnormal levels of proteins in tumor interstitial fluid may be detected in peripheral blood and thus serve as easily accessible tumor markers . Here , we show that stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 ( P31948 ) was secreted by ovarian cancer tissues into the peripheral blood of patients , resulting in a significant increase of serum levels of P31948 in cancer patients compared with those in age-matched normal controls . Our results further indicated that combined use of Q8WXI7 and P31948 may increase early detection of ovarian cancer . Functionally , recombinant P31948 significantly induced P29323 phosphorylation , promoted DNA synthesis , and increased Ki-67 immunoreactivity in ovarian cancer cells , suggesting that P31948 in vitro promotes cell proliferation . Colocalization of P31948 and phospho- P29323 in human ovarian cancer tissues also supports an in vivo activation of P29323 by P31948 . Further understanding of molecular roles of P31948 in human ovarian cancer may shed light on its pathophysiology and development of novel therapeutic strategies .
