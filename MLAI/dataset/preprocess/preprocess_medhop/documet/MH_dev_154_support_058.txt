DB00013 upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in THP-1 monocytes via gene transcription and protein synthesis . P00749 ( uPA ) is suggested to exert its proliferatory , migratory and invasive action through binding with its membrane receptor , promoting pericellular proteolysis and mediating cell signal transduction . One of the possible actions of urokinase can be related to the regulation of activity and/or the expression of proteolytic enzymes participating in extracellular matrix degradation . In the present study , the role of uPA in regulating matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) expression and release by the monocyte cell line THP-1 was investigated . Recombinant uPA induced the release of P14780 /gelatinase B , as detected by zymography and Western blotting , and this release was abolished by actinomycin D and cycloheximide ( inhibitors of DNA transcription and protein synthesis ) and partially suppressed by monensin ( an inhibitor of secretion ) . Proteolytically inactive urokinase with substitution of DB00117 (204) for Gln was able to reproduce about 70 % of the effect induced by the wild-type recombinant uPA . The reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot data indicated that the action of r-uPA on THP-1 cells resulted in formation of P14780 mRNA , which depended on time , within 6-48 h , of the cell incubation with r-uPA . These results suggest that urokinase upregulates P14780 expression in monocytes via P14780 gene transcription and protein biosynthesis .
