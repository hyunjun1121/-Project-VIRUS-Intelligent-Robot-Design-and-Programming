Platelet aggregation inhibition in patients receiving statins either fully or partially metabolized by P08684 . DB00758 therapy is the standard for prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events . DB00758 is converted to an active thiol by the cytochrome P450 CYP 3A4 and 2C19 enzymes . Recent studies suggest that statins metabolized by P08684 attenuate the anti-aggregatory effect of clopidogrel . We evaluated the effect of P08684 -metabolized statins ( atorvastatin , group 1 ) and partially- P08684 -metabolized statins ( simvastatin , group 2 ) on platelet aggregation inhibition ( P05121 ) when given concomitantly with clopidogrel as compared to patients who were statin naive ( group 3 ) . P05121 was measured by PlateletWorks ( Helena Laboratories ICHOR ) using the platelet Q9H244 receptor agonist ADP ( 20 micromol ) . All patients were on clopidogrel therapy ( 75 mg/day ) . Non-responsiveness was defined as a P05121 of < 35 % . There was no statistical difference in mean P05121 among groups ; a higher prevalence of clopidogrel non-responders was noted in group 1 compared to group 3 ( p=0.002 ) . Multivariate analysis , adjusting for unequal presence of metabolic syndrome and hypertension , we found no statistical difference between groups . Our data suggests that statins , either fully or partially metabolized by P08684 , do not influence P05121 when clopidogrel is used at 75 mg/day , even after adjusting for risk factors . We concluded that concomitant statins with clopidogrel therapy does not influence the effect of clopidogrel in P05121 .
