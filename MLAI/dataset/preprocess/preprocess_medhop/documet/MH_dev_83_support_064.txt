Regional expression and role of cyclooxygenase-2 following experimental traumatic brain injury . Prostaglandins , potent mediators of inflammation , are generated from arachidonic acid ( AA ) via the action of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 ( P23219 and P35354 ) . In this study , we report that lateral cortical impact injury in rats significantly increases P35354 protein levels both in the cortex surrounding the injury site and the ipsilateral hippocampus . P35354 protein level was elevated as early as 3 h postinjury and persisted for up to 3 days . Increases in immunoreactivity were detected not only in the adjacent cortex and hippocampus , but were also observed in the contralateral cortex and hippocampus , the ipsilateral piriform cortex and the ipsilateral amygdaloid complex . P35354 immunoreactive cells appear morphologically normal and do not present any of the characteristic features of apoptosis . Double immunostaining experiments using either a neuron-specific or an astroglial-specific marker show that the expression of P35354 is localized almost exclusively in neuronal cells . Administration of the P35354 inhibitor 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfona mide ( celecoxib , marketed as DB00482 ) worsens motor , but not cognitive , performance , suggesting that P35354 induction following traumatic brain injury may play a protective role .
