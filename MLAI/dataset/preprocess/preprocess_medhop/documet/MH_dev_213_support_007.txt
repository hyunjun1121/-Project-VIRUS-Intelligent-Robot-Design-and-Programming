Separation of peptides from detergents using ion mobility spectrometry . Mass spectrometry ( MS ) has dramatically evolved in the last two decades and has been the driving force of the spectacular expansion of proteomics during this period . However , the very poor compatibility of MS with detergents is still a technical obstacle in some studies , in particular on membrane proteins . Indeed , the high hydrophobicity of membrane proteins necessitates the use of detergents for their extraction and solubilization . Here , we address the analytical potential of high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry ( FAIMS ) for separating peptides from detergents . The study was focused on peptides from the human integral membrane protein P21926 . A tryptic peptide was mixed with the non-ionic detergents Triton X-100 or beta-D-dodecyl maltoside ( DDM ) as well as with the ionic detergents sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) or sodium DB03619 ( P18827 ) . Although electrospray ionization ( P19957 ) alone led to a total suppression of the peptide ion signal on mass spectra with only detection of the detergents , use of FAIMS allowed separation and clear identification of the peptide with any of the detergents studied . The detection and identification of the target compound in the presence of an excess of detergents are then feasible . FAIMS should prove especially useful in the structural and proteomic analysis of membrane proteins .
