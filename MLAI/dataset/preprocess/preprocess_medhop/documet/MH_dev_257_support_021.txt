Pharmacological Q9BWK5 mapping of age-associated changes in basal ganglia circuitry of awake rhesus monkeys . While the pathophysiological changes induced by the loss of dopamine innervation in the basal ganglia by Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) are well studied , little is known about functional changes in the neural circuitry of this area during normal aging . Here we report the first survey of age-associated changes in the basal ganglia of behaviorally characterized , awake rhesus monkeys , using pharmacological Q9BWK5 to map responses to dopaminergic stimulation . DB00714 , a mixed D(1)/ P14416 agonist , evoked little change in the substantia nigra ( SN ) of aged animals while significantly reducing activation in young adult monkeys . Compared to young animals , both apomorphine and DB01576 ( which increases synaptic dopamine levels ) significantly increased activation of the aged rhesus globus pallidus externa ( GPe ) . In addition , the aged animals showed decreased activity in the putamen in response to DB01576 administration . Although the responses in the SN and putamen of the aged monkeys differed from those in animal models of PD , the apomorphine-evoked activation of their GPe corresponded with apomorphine-induced increases in neuronal activity seen in Parkinson 's patients and animal models . Given the major role of the GPe in regulating motor behavior , the altered responses in the aged GPe may contribute significantly to the motor slowing and movement dysfunctions characterizing advanced age .
