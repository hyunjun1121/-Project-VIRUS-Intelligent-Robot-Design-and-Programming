HMG DB01992 reductase inhibitor suppresses the expression of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 induced by angiotensin II in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : It has been demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ( HRIs ) reduce the incidence of acute cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia . Recent reports have shown that the protective effects of these drugs against cardiovascular events are also observed in patients without hyperlipidemia , but the mechanism of this favorable effect still remains unclear . In this study , the effects of HRIs on the endothelial regulation of thrombus formation were elucidated . METHODS AND RESULTS : The mRNA and protein expression of tissue factor ( TF ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) induced by angiotensin II ( Ang II ) were evaluated in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells . Pretreatment with simvastatin ( 0.03-3 microg/ml ) significantly inhibited TF and P05121 induction by Ang II in a dose- and time-dependent manner . These inhibitions were significantly attenuated by mevalonic acid or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate . Both Rho inhibitor , P01024 exoenzyme , and Rho kinase inhibitor , Y-27632 , mimicked the inhibitory effects of simvastatin against TF and P05121 induced by Ang II . This result suggested that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway is related to the TF and P05121 induction by Ang II . CONCLUSION : It was indicated that simvastatin maintains endothelial cells to be antithrombotic by inhibiting TF and P05121 expression via the Rho/Rho kinase pathways in which AngII induces TF and P05121 expression . These observations explain , at least partly , the mechanism of the favorable effects of simvastatin in reducing the thrombotic events .
