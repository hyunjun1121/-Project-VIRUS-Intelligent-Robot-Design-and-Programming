Structural basis for P01133 receptor inhibition by the therapeutic antibody DB05774 . Therapeutic anticancer strategies that target and inactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) are under intense study in the clinic . Here we describe the mechanism of P00533 inhibition by an antibody drug DB05774 . DB05774 is a fully human antibody that has similar antitumor potency as the chimeric cetuximab/Erbitux and might represent a safer therapeutic alternative . We report the X-ray crystal structure of the Fab fragment of DB05774 ( Fab11F8 ) in complex with the entire extracellular region and with isolated domain III of P00533 . We compare this to our previous study of the cetuximab/ P00533 interaction . Fab11F8 interacts with a remarkably similar epitope , but through a completely different set of interactions . Both the similarities and differences in binding of these two antibodies have important implications for the development of inhibitors that could exploit this same mechanism of P00533 inhibition .
