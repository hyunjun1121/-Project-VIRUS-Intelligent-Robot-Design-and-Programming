Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases , GSK-3beta and CK1 by hymenialdisine , a marine sponge constituent . BACKGROUND : Over 2000 protein kinases regulate cellular functions . Screening for inhibitors of some of these kinases has already yielded some potent and selective compounds with promising potential for the treatment of human diseases . RESULTS : The marine sponge constituent hymenialdisine is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and casein kinase 1 . DB02950 competes with DB00171 for binding to these kinases . A P24941 -hymenialdisine complex crystal structure shows that three hydrogen bonds link hymenialdisine to the Glu81 and Leu83 residues of P24941 , as observed with other inhibitors . DB02950 inhibits Q00535 /p35 in vivo as demonstrated by the lack of phosphorylation/down-regulation of Pak1 kinase in E18 rat cortical neurons , and also inhibits GSK-3 in vivo as shown by the inhibition of P46821 phosphorylation . DB02950 also blocks the in vivo phosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau at sites that are hyperphosphorylated by GSK-3 and Q00535 /p35 in Alzheimer 's disease ( cross-reacting with Alzheimer's-specific AT100 antibodies ) . CONCLUSIONS : The natural product hymenialdisine is a new kinase inhibitor with promising potential applications for treating neurodegenerative disorders .
