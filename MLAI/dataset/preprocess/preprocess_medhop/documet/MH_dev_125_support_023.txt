Q16552 promotes p38 MAPK-dependent endothelial activation enhancing neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation . Neutrophilic inflammation plays an important role in lung tissue destruction occurring in many chronic pulmonary diseases . Neutrophils can be recruited to sites of inflammation via the action of the cytokine Q16552 . In this study , we report that Q96F46 and Q8NAC3 mRNA expression is significantly increased in asthmatic bronchoscopic biopsies and that these receptors are not only expressed on epithelial and inflammatory cells but also on endothelial cells . Q16552 potently stimulates lung microvascular endothelial cells to produce chemoattractants ( P10145 and derivatives of the P09917 pathway ) that selectively drive neutrophil but not lymphocyte chemotaxis . Moreover , Q16552 promotes endothelial activation by inducing the expression of endothelial adhesion markers ( P16581 , P19320 , and P05362 ) in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner . This increased expression of adhesion molecules stimulates the trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils , as well as the transmigration of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells , suggesting a further role in promoting lung metastasis . Finally , Q16552 increased neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium in vivo as determined by intravital microscopy of mice cremaster muscle . Overall , our results demonstrate that Q16552 is a potent activator of the endothelium in vivo leading to neutrophil infiltration . Therefore , preventing neutrophil recruitment by blocking the action of Q16552 on endothelial cells may prove to be highly beneficial in diseases in which neutrophilic inflammation plays a key role .
