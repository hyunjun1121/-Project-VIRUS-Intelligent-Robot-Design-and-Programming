Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications are cytostatic against human vestibular schwannomas . Vestibular schwannomas ( VSs ) are the most common tumors of the cerebellopontine angle . Significant clinical need exists for pharmacotherapies against VSs . Motivated by previous findings that immunohistochemical expression of cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) correlates with VS growth rate , we investigated the role of P35354 in VSs and tested P35354 inhibiting salicylates against VSs . P35354 was found to be aberrantly expressed in human VS and primary human VS cells in comparison with control human nerve specimens and primary Schwann cells ( SCs ) , respectively . Furthermore , levels of prostaglandin E2 , the downstream enzymatic product of P35354 , were correlated with primary VS culture proliferation rate . Because P35354 inhibiting salicylates such as aspirin are well tolerated and frequently clinically used , we assessed their repurposing for VS . Changes in proliferation , cell death , and cell viability were analyzed in primary VS cultures treated with aspirin , sodium salicylate , or DB00244 . These drugs neither increased VS cell death nor affected healthy SCs . The cytostatic effect of aspirin in vitro was in concurrence with our previous clinical finding that patients with VS taking aspirin demonstrate reduced tumor growth . Overall , this work suggests that P35354 is a key modulator in VS cell proliferation and survival and highlights salicylates as promising pharmacotherapies against VS .
