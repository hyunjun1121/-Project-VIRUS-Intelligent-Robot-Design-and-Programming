The nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) is activated by androsterone . Farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) uses bile acids as endogenous ligands . Here , we demonstrate that androsterone , a metabolic product of testosterone , is also an Q96RI1 ligand . Treatment of castrated male mice with androsterone induced expression of the Q96RI1 target gene small heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) . In mouse AML-12 hepatocytes , chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) or androsterone induced Q15466 expression with a similar kinetic pattern . The Q96RI1 antagonist guggulsterone blocked the induction of Q15466 by androsterone in AML-12 cells . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated the direct binding of androsterone to purified human Q96RI1 ( hFXR ) ligand-binding domain ( LBD ) protein , resulting in the recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator protein-1 ( Q15788 ) coactivator peptide . In HEK293 cells , androsterone activated gal4-mouse Q96RI1 -LBD and gal4-hFXR-LBD fusion proteins , although in contrast to DB06777 , androsterone activation was significantly greater for the mouse Q96RI1 -LBD than for the hFXR-LBD . Site-directed mutagenesis of the hFXR-LBD defined amino acids Asn354 and Ser345 as critical for differential species sensitivity to DB06777 and androsterone , respectively . Crystal structure studies suggest that the orientation of the steroid nucleus of bile acids within the binding pocket of Q96RI1 is reversed from all other nuclear hormone receptors . In support of this model , we show here that mutations M265I or R331H , residues predicted by crystal structure to interact with the carboxylic acid tail of DB06777 but not with androsterone , altered DB06777 activation but had no effect on androsterone activation . Activation of Q96RI1 by androsterone may provide an additional means for physiological or pharmacological modulation of Q96RI1 .
