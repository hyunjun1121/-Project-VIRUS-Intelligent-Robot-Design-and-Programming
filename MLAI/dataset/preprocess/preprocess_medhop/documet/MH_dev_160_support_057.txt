How tumour necrosis factor blockers interfere with tuberculosis immunity . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immunity to numerous bacterial infections , including Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , the causative agent of tuberculosis ( TB ) in humans . DB00065 , adalimumab , certolizumab pegol and etanercept are anti- P01375 agents used to treat a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis . The use of some of these drugs has been linked to reactivation TB . In addition to blocking P01375 -mediated immune responses , some anti- P01375 drugs have been found to interfere with innate immune responses , such as phagolysosomal maturation and monocyte apoptosis , as well as cell-mediated responses , including interferon-gamma secretion by memory T cells , complement-mediated lysis of Mtb-reactive CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cell activity . This review summarizes some of the reported effects of P01375 blockers on immune cell responses in the context of the observed clinical data on TB reactivation in patients on anti- P01375 therapy .
