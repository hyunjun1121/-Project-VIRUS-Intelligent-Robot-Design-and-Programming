[ Molecular-target therapy for advanced malignant melanoma ] . Malignant melanoma is insensitive to chemotherapy , and standard therapy for metastatic melanoma has been dacarbazine for years . Molecular abnormalities of malignant melanoma , mainly of Q96HU1 kinase signals such as P15056 mutation , have been clarified , and molecular target therapy for melanoma has been developed recently . DB08881 , an inhibitor for mutated P15056 , has shown its efficacy for the first time , with response rate of more than 50 % , and an overall improvement in survival compared with dacarbazine in a phase III study . Skin toxicities including squamous cell carcinoma , are the most severe adverse events . Another P15056 inhibitor , dabrafenib , and a MEK inhibitor , trametinib , have shown excellent efficacy in clinical studies . Melanoma also has high immunogenicity , and cytokines or cell immunotherapy have shown some efficacy . Recently , the importance of immune checkpoints which adjust T-cell activation , such as the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( P16410 ) , - P33681 or the programmed cell death protein-1(PD1)-PD1 ligand( Q9NZQ7 ) , have been clarified . Targeting those immune checkpoints is expected to be effective for enhancing tumor immunity . P16410 antibody ipilimumab has been reported to improve overall survival in two phase III studies . Major adverse events were autoimmune response such as colitis , eruption , liver dysfunction and endocrineopathies . Antibodies to PD1 or Q9NZQ7 have shown a higher response rate than those of ipilimumab , and seem to accompany fewer autoimmune responses in phase I studies . These two types of targeting therapy are expected to be standard therapies for melanoma .
