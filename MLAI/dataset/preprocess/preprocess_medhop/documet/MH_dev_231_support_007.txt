Protein kinase Cα phosphorylates a novel argininosuccinate synthase site at serine 328 during calcium-dependent stimulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells . Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( P29474 ) utilizes l-arginine as its principal substrate , converting it to l-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). l- DB00155 is recycled to l-arginine by two enzymes , argininosuccinate synthase ( AS ) and argininosuccinate lyase , providing the substrate arginine for P29474 and NO production in endothelial cells . Together , these three enzymes , P29474 , AS , and argininosuccinate lyase , make up the citrulline-NO cycle . Although AS catalyzes the rate-limiting step in NO production , little is known about the regulation of AS in endothelial cells beyond the level of transcription . In this study , we showed that AS DB00133 -328 phosphorylation was coordinately regulated with P29474 DB00133 -1179 phosphorylation when bovine aortic endothelial cells were stimulated by either a calcium ionophore or thapsigargin to produce NO . Furthermore , using in vitro kinase assay , kinase inhibition studies , as well as protein kinase Cα ( PKCα ) knockdown experiments , we demonstrate that the calcium-dependent phosphorylation of AS DB00133 -328 is mediated by PKCα . Collectively , these findings suggest that phosphorylation of AS at DB00133 -328 is regulated in accordance with the calcium-dependent regulation of P29474 under conditions that promote NO production and are in keeping with the rate-limiting role of AS in the citrulline-NO cycle of vascular endothelial cells .
