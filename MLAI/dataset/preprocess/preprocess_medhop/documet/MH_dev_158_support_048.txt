Immunophilins in nervous system degeneration and regeneration . Immunophilins are receptors for immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A , FK506 , rapamycin and their non- immunosuppressive analogs , which are collectively referred to as " immunophilin ligands " ( Q53GA4 ) . DB00091 binds to a class of IP called cyclophilins , whereas the receptors for FK506 and rapamycin belong to the family of FK506- binding proteins ( FKBP ) . The latter are designated according to their molecular weight : P62942 , 25 , 52 etc . FKBP levels in the rat brain are up to 50 times higher than in the immune system . P62942 is associated with IP3 and ryanodine receptors present on the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in stabilizing calcium release . It has also been proposed to be a modulator of the TGFbeta receptor activity . Crush injury of facial or sciatic nerves in rat leads to markedly increased P62942 levels in the respective nerve nuclei and this increase is related to nerve regeneration . P62937 protects cells from death following expression of mutant Cu/ Zn superoxide dismutase , which is associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Our recent studies show that P62942 and Q02790 are expressed in the human nervous system , especially in the substantia nigra- deep gray matter axis . In neurodegenerative diseases , P62942 levels increase in neurons situated in areas of pathology . This IP colocalizes with synaptophysin and alpha- synuclein , suggesting that it may become a novel marker of pathology . Immunophilins participate in axonal transport , synaptic vesicle assembly and may play a role in neuroprotection against abnormal protein aggregation , suggesting a potential avenue of therapeutic interventions .
