Novel systemic markers for patients with Alzheimer disease ? - a pilot study . Almost 2 % of the population of western industrialized countries are affected by Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Nevertheless the pathogenetic process leading to this neurodegenerative disease is widely unknown . Thus , we focus on novel pathophysiological aspects of AD . We hypothesize that AD patients reveal increased levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) expressing proinflammatory ( P35354 , P01375 , P25942 ) , proapoptotic ( P09874 ) , adhesion-relevant ( P28907 ) or AD associated ( C99 , P56817 , P49768 ) proteins as well as elevated proinflammatory biochemical plasma parameters . Therefore , PBMCs of AD patients and age-matched control subjects were studied by two color fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis . Furthermore , concentration of plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) and P01375 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found a significantly increased percentage of P01375 , P35354 , P09874 , P28907 , C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs in AD patients compared with healthy subjects . FACS analyses revealed that the percentage of C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs , which also express P01375 , P35354 , P09874 or P28907 is also increased in AD patients . Additionally , AD patients had significantly increased plasma oxLDL and P01375 levels . Furthermore , we found positive correlations between plasma oxLDL or P01375 concentrations and the percentage of TNFalpha+ , P35354 + or P09874 + , as well as P49768 + , C99+ or P56817 + PBMCs . Our findings suggest that immunocytological investigations , based on immunophenotyping of AD relevant proteins combined with measurement of proinflammatory , proapoptotic and adhesion-relevant proteins in PBMCs may provide more insight into the pathophysiology of AD .
