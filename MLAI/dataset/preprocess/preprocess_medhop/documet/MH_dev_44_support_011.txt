DB00644 1 directly affects corpora lutea lifespan in Mediterranean buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ) during diestrus : presence and in vitro effects on enzymatic and hormonal activities . The expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) receptor ( P30968 ) and the direct role of P01148 on corpora lutea function were studied in Mediterranean buffalo during diestrus . Immunohistochemistry evidenced at early , mid , and late luteal stages the presence of P30968 only in large luteal cells and P01148 in both small and large luteal cells . Real-time PCR revealed P30968 and P01148 mRNA at the three luteal stages , with lowest values in late corpora lutea . In vitro corpora lutea progesterone production was greater in mid stages and lesser in late luteal phases , whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha ( PGF2alpha ) increased from early to late stages , and DB00917 was greater in the earlier-luteal phase . Cyclooxygenase 1 ( prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 ; P23219 ) activity did not change during diestrus , whereas P35354 increased from early to late stages , and DB00917 -9-ketoreductase ( DB00917 -9-K ) was greater in late corpora lutea . P23219 activity was greater than P35354 in early corpora lutea and lesser in late luteal phase . In corpora lutea cultured in vitro , the P01148 analog ( buserelin ) reduced progesterone secretion and increased PGF2alpha secretion as well as P35354 and DB00917 -9-K activities at mid and late stages . DB00917 release and P23219 activity were increased by buserelin only in late corpora lutea . These results suggest that P01148 is expressed in all luteal cells of buffalo , whereas P30968 is only expressed in large luteal phase . Additionally , P01148 directly down-regulates corpora lutea progesterone release , with the concomitant increases of PGF2alpha production and P35354 and DB00917 -9-K enzymatic activities .
