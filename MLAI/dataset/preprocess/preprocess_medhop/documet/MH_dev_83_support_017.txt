Membranous glomerulopathy and acute interstitial nephritis following treatment with celecoxib . Both membranous glomerulopathy and acute interstitial nephritis have been reported to occur following treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . We report the first cases of membranous glomerulopathy and acute interstitial nephritis following treatment with celecoxib ( DB00482 ) , a selective P35354 inhibitor . The rapid and complete resolution of both conditions following discontinuation of DB00482 strongly implicates this agent in disease pathogenesis . These cases enlarge the spectrum of potential renal toxicities of the P35354 -specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs .
