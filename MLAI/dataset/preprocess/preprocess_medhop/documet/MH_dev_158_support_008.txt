Design and synthesis of conformationally constrained cyclophilin inhibitors showing a cyclosporin-A phenotype in C. elegans . P62937 ( CypA ) is a member of the immunophilin family of proteins and receptor for the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) . Here we describe the design and synthesis of a new class of small-molecule inhibitors for CypA that are based upon a dimedone template . Electrospray mass spectrometry is utilised as an initial screen to quantify the protein affinity of the ligands . Active inhibitors and fluorescently labelled derivatives are then used as chemical probes for investigating the biological role of cyclophilins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans .
