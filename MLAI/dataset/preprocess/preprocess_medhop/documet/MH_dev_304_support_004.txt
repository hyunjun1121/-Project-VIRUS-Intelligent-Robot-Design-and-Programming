Cytokine induced changes in proteasome subunit composition are concentration dependent . In eukaryotes , 20S proteasome subunit composition is controlled by the cytokine interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . P01579 induces the synthesis of the beta-subunits P28065 , P28062 and MECL-1 , which in consequence replace their constitutive subunit homologs delta , MB1 and MC14/Z in the 20S complex . By pulse labeling mouse RMA cells and immunoprecipitation of proteasome complexes with the antibody MP3 , we have analysed the effect of different P01579 concentrations on proteasomal subunit composition . Our experiments show that P01579 concentrations as low as 5 U/ml induce subunit substitutions and that overall proteasomal subunit composition is dependent on the cytokine concentration used . An P01579 concentration of 50 U/ml is sufficient for complete replacement of subunit delta by P28065 . In contrast , P01579 treatment never induces a complete replacement of subunit MC14 by MECL-1 . These subunits are present at an approximate 1:1 molar ratio , suggesting that both subunits coexist in the same 20S proteasome complex . Furthermore , different regulatory mechanisms have to be postulated for the synthesis and incorporation of the three P01579 inducible proteasome subunits . Both P01579 as well as P60568 also seem to influence the modification state of the alpha subunit Q99618 . Since the subunit composition is dependent on the cytokine concentration used and strongly influences the proteolytic properties of the 20S proteasome complex , our experiments represent a caveat for experiments in which P01579 dependent proteasomal enzyme characteristics have been analysed without monitoring the subunit composition .
