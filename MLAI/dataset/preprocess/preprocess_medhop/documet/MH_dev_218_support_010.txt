P08637 -158 polymorphism influences the biological response to infliximab in Crohn 's disease through affecting the ADCC activity . An association between P08637 -158 V/F polymorphism and biological responses to infliximab has been reported in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) in Western countries . However , little is known about the mechanism by which gene polymorphism affects the responses to infliximab . The aims of this study were to confirm the association in Japanese CD patients and to reveal the effect of gene polymorphism on biological responses to infliximab . Japanese CD patients were examined retrospectively at weeks 8 and 30 . Clinical and biological responses were assessed by the Crohn 's disease activity index and P02741 levels , respectively . The infliximab-binding affinity of natural killer ( NK ) cells from P08637 -158 V/V , V/F and F/F donors was examined . DB00065 -mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activities were also determined using transmembrane P01375 -Î±-expressing Jurkat T cells as target cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from V/V , V/F and F/F donors as effector cells . Biological responses at week 8 were statistically higher in V/V patients , whereas no significant differences were observed in either clinical responses at weeks 8 and 30 or biological responses at week 30 among the three genotypes . NK cells and PBMCs from V/V patients also showed higher infliximab-binding affinity and infliximab-mediated ADCC activity , respectively . Our results suggest that P08637 -158 polymorphism is a predicting factor of biological responses to infliximab in the early phases . P08637 -158 polymorphism was also found to affect the infliximab-binding affinity of NK cells and infliximab-mediated ADCC activity in vitro , suggesting that an effect on ADCC activity influences biological responses to infliximab in CD patients .
