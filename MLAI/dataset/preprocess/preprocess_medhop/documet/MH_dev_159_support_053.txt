PEG minocycline-liposomes ameliorate CNS autoimmune disease . BACKGROUND : DB01017 is an oral tetracycline derivative with good bioavailability in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . DB01017 , a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 , attenuates disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , an animal model of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Potential adverse effects associated with long-term daily minocycline therapy in human patients are concerning . Here , we investigated whether less frequent treatment with long-circulating polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) minocycline liposomes are effective in treating EAE . FINDINGS : Performing in vitro time kinetic studies of PEG minocycline-liposomes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , we determined that PEG minocycline-liposome preparations stabilized with CaCl(2) are effective in diminishing P14780 activity . Intravenous injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes every five days were as effective in ameliorating clinical EAE as daily intraperitoneal injections of minocycline . Treatment of animals with PEG minocycline-liposomes significantly reduced the number of CNS-infiltrating leukocytes , and the overall expression of P14780 in the CNS . There was also a significant suppression of P14780 expression and proteolytic activity in splenocytes of treated animals , but not in CNS-infiltrating leukocytes . Thus , leukocytes gaining access to the brain and spinal cord require the same absolute amount of P14780 in all treatment groups , but minocycline decreases the absolute cell number . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate that less frequent injections of PEG minocycline-liposomes are an effective alternative pharmacotherapy to daily minocycline injections for the treatment of CNS autoimmune diseases . Also , inhibition of P14780 remains a promising treatment target in EAE and patients with MS .
