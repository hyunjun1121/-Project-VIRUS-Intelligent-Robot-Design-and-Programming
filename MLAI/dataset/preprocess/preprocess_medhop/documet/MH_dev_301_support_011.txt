Effect of currently approved carriers and adjuvants on the pre-clinical efficacy of a conjugate vaccine against oxycodone in mice and rats . Vaccination against the highly abused prescription opioid oxycodone has shown pre-clinical efficacy for blocking oxycodone effects . The current study further evaluated a candidate vaccine composed of oxycodone derivatized at the P13671 position ( 6OXY ) conjugated to the native DB05299 ( nKLH ) carrier protein . To provide an oxycodone vaccine formulation suitable for human studies , we studied the effect of alternative carriers and adjuvants on the generation of oxycodone-specific serum antibody and B cell responses , and the effect of immunization on oxycodone distribution and oxycodone-induced antinociception in mice and rats . 6OXY conjugated to tetanus toxoid ( TT ) or a GMP grade KLH dimer ( dKLH ) was as effective as 6OXY conjugated to the nKLH decamer in mice and rats , while the 6OXY hapten conjugated to a TT-derived peptide was not effective in preventing oxycodone-induced antinociception in mice . Immunization with 6OXY-TT s.c. absorbed on alum adjuvant provided similar protection to 6OXY-TT administered i.p. with Freund 's adjuvant in rats . The toll-like receptor 4 ( O00206 ) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPLA ) adjuvant , alone or in combination with alum , offered no advantage over alum alone for generating oxycodone-specific serum antibodies or 6OXY-specific antibody secreting B cells in mice vaccinated with 6OXY-nKLH or 6OXY-TT . The immunogenicity of oxycodone vaccines may be modulated by O00206 signaling since responses to 6OXY-nKLH in alum were decreased in O00206 -deficient mice . These data suggest that TT , nKLH and dKLH carriers provide consistent 6OXY conjugate vaccine immunogenicity across species , strains and via different routes of administration , while adjuvant formulations may need to be tailored to individual immunogens or patient populations .
