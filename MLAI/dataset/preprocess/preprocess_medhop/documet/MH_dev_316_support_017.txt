Inhibition of DB00171 -sensitive K+ channels by substituted benzo[c]quinolizinium P13569 activators . The substituted benzo[c]quinolizinium compounds MPB-07 and MPB-91 are novel activators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) chloride channel . High homologies between P13569 and the sulfonylurea receptor ( Q09428 ) , which associates with the potassium channel Kir6.2 to form the DB00171 -sensitive K(+) ( K( DB00171 ) ) channel , prompted us to examine possible effects of these compounds on K( DB00171 ) channels using electrophysiological recordings and binding assays . Activity of recombinant K( DB00171 ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was recorded in the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique . Channels were practically unaffected by MPB-07 but were fully blocked by MPB-91 with half-inhibition achieved at approximately 20 microM MPB-91 . These effects were similar on channels formed by Kir6.2 , and either the Q09428 or SUR2A isoforms were independent of the presence of nucleotides . They were not influenced by Q09428 mutations known to interfere with its nucleotide-binding capacity . MPB-91 , but not MPB-07 , was able to displace binding of glibenclamide to P29320 cells expressing recombinant Q09428 /Kir6.2 channels . DB01016 binding to native channels from pancreatic MIN6 cells was also displaced by MPB-91 . A Kir6.2 mutant able to form channels without Q09428 was also blocked by MPB-91 , but not by MPB-07 . These observations demonstrate that neither MPB-07 nor MPB-91 interact with Q09428 , in spite of its high homology with P13569 , and that MPB-91 blocks K( DB00171 ) channels by binding to the Kir6.2 subunit . Thus , caution should be exercised when planning to use MPB compounds in cystic fibrosis therapy , specially MPB-91 which could nonetheless find interesting applications as the precursor of a new class of K channel blockers .
