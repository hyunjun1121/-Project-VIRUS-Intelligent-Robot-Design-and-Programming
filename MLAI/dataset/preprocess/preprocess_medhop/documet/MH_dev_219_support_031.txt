Cinnamon polyphenols attenuate the hydrogen peroxide-induced down regulation of S100β secretion by regulating sirtuin 1 in P13671 rat glioma cells . AIMS : It is well established that the brain is particularly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its high consumption of oxygen . The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects of a water soluble polyphenol-rich extract of cinnamon and the possible mechanisms , under conditions of oxidative stress-induced by hydrogen peroxide , in rat P13671 glioma cells . MAIN METHODS : After 24h of H2O2 incubation , the secretion and intracellular expression of S100β were determined by immunoprecitation/immunoblotting and immunofluorescence imaging . KEY FINDINGS : Cinnamon polyphenols ( CP ) counteracted the oxidative effects of H2O2 on S100β secretion and expression . CP also enhanced the impaired protein levels of sirtuins 1 , 2 , and 3 , which are deacetylases important in cell survival . H2O2 also induced the overexpression of the proinflammatory factors , P01375 -α , phospho-NF-κB p65 , as well as of Bcl-xl , Bax and P42574 , which are all the members of the Bcl-2 family . CP not only suppressed the expression of these proteins but also attenuated the phosphorylation induced by H2O2 . CP also upregulated the decreased Bcl-2 protein levels in H2O2 treated P13671 cells . The effects of CP on H2O2-induced downregulation of S100β secretion were blocked by Q96EB6 siRNA demonstrating that Q96EB6 plays a regulatory role in CP-mediated prevention by H2O2 . SIGNIFICANCE : These data demonstrate that Cinnamon polyphenols may exert neuroprotective effects in glial cells by the regulation of Bcl-2 family members and enhancing Q96EB6 expression during oxidative stress .
