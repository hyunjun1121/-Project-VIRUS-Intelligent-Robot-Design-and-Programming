Derivatization of ( ± ) dihydrotetrabenazine for copper-64 labeling towards long-lived radiotracers for PET imaging of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 . Dihydrotetrabenazine ( DTBZ ) derivatized from ( + ) DB04844 ( TBZ ) has been used for imaging the expression of Q05940 when labeled with (11)C ( t1/2=20.3 min ) or (18)F ( t1/2=110 min ) in neurodegenerative diseases or pancreatic beta-cell . Because (11)C or (18)F radiolabels are only available in the proximity of a biomedical cyclotron facility , here we report our work of derivatizing ( + ) and ( - ) DTBZ using a (64)Cu-specific bifunctional chelator scaffold ( (64)Cu : t1/2=12.7 h ) for the preparation of long-lived Q05940 targeted radiotracers , (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(+)-DTBZ and (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(-)-DTBZ . The specific Q05940 binding affinity of (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-(+)-DTBZ measured using rat brain homogenate or porcine islets was not compromised by our chemical modifications while that of its ( - ) counterpart remained low as in (11)C or (18)F labeled ( ± ) DTBZ .
