The kinase inhibitor staurosporine induces P55008 arrest at two points : effect on retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 in normal and transformed cells . DB02010 ( ST ) , a protein kinase inhibitor , at a concentration of 20 nM arrests normal diploid fibroblasts 3 h into P55008 ( H. A. Crissman et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 88 : 7580-7584 , 1991 ; K. Abe et al. , Exp. Cell Res. , 192 : 122-127 , 1991 ) . ST ( 2 nM ) induces a new P55008 arrest point at 6 h into P55008 . Partial phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein was observed at the 2 nM ST arrest point , whereas the retinoblastoma protein was unphosphorylated or underphosphorylated at the 20 nM arrest point . This correlated with the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( P24941 ) and the phosphorylation of the Thr160 residue of p33CDK2 . The cyclin E and cyclin D1/2 levels were reduced at the 20 nM ST arrest point . In HeLa cells that do not arrest in P55008 in response to 2 or 20 nM ST , the retinoblastoma protein and P24941 phosphorylations and P24941 activity were not affected by ST . These results suggest that ST inhibits one or more P55008 -regulating protein kinases , which lie upstream of P24941 .
