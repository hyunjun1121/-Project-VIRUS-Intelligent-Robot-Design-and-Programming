Fucoxanthin enhances cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity via NFκB-mediated pathway and downregulates DNA repair gene expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells . Cisplain , a platinum-containing anticancer drug , has been shown to enhance DNA repair and to inhibit cell apoptosis , leading to drug resistance . Thus , the combination of anticancer drugs with nutritional factors is a potential strategy for improving the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy . In this study , we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of a combination of fucoxanthin , the major non-provitamin A carotenoid found in Undaria Pinnatifida , and cisplatin in human hepatoma HepG2 cells . We found that fucoxanthin ( 1-10 μΜ ) pretreatment for 24 h followed by cisplatin ( 10 μΜ ) for 24 h significantly decreased cell proliferation , as compared with cisplatin treatment alone . Mechanistically , we showed that fucoxanthin attenuated cisplatin-induced NFκB expression and enhanced the NFκB-regulated Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio . DB00515 alone induced mRNA expression of excision repair cross complementation 1 ( P07992 ) and thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) through phosphorylation of P29323 , p38 and PI3K/AKT pathways . However , fucoxanthin pretreatment significantly attenuated cisplatin-induced P07992 and TP mRNA expression , leading to improvement of chemotherapeutic efficacy of cisplatin . The results suggest that a combined treatment with fucoxanthin and cisplatin could lead to a potentially important new therapeutic strategy against human hepatoma cells .
