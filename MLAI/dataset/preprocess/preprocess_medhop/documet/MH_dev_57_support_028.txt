P49675 -related lipid transfer domain protein 5 binds primary bile acids . Steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer ( START ) domain proteins are involved in the nonvesicular intracellular transport of lipids and sterols . The P49675 ( P49675 and Q14849 ) and Q96DR4 subfamilies ( Q96DR4 -6 ) have an internal cavity large enough to accommodate sterols . To provide a deeper understanding on the structural biology of this domain , the binding of sterols to Q9NSY2 , a member of the Q96DR4 subfamily , was monitored . The SAR by NMR [ (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence ( HSQC ) ] approach , complemented by circular dichroism ( CD ) and isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , was used . Titration of Q9NSY2 with cholic ( CA ) and chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , ligands of the farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) , leads to drastic perturbation of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra and the identification of the residues in contact with those ligands . The most perturbed residues in presence of ligands are lining the internal cavity of the protein . Ka values of 1.8·10-(4) M(-1) and 6.3·10(4) M(-1) were measured for CA and DB06777 , respectively . This is the first report of a START domain protein in complex with a sterol ligand . Our original findings indicate that Q9NSY2 may be involved in the transport of bile acids rather than cholesterol .
