Selective cleavage of ErbB4 by G-protein-coupled gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor in cultured hypothalamic neurons . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) is secreted from hypothalamic neurons ( DB00644 neurons ) . DB00644 neurons have a P30968 belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptors . The stimulation of this receptor activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) . In the present study , we found that epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and ErbB4 were expressed in immortalized DB00644 neurons ( GT1-7 cells ) . AG1478 , a relatively specific inhibitor of the ErbB family , and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) for ErbB4 inhibited the DB00644 -induced activation of P29323 in GT1-7 cells , suggesting that P00533 and ErbB4 were necessary for the activation . In addition , DB00644 induced the cleavage of ErbB4 and accumulation of an 80-kDa fragment . After treatment of the cells with 50 nM DB00644 for 5 min , about 80 % of ErbB4 was cleaved . Biotinylation of cell surface proteins revealed that more than 70 % of the cell surface ErbB4 was cleaved by DB00644 treatment . A higher concentration and longer treatment were necessary for DB00644 to induce ErbB4 cleavage than P29323 activation . TAPI-2 , an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-Î±-converting enzyme ( P78536 ) , and siRNA for P78536 inhibited the cleavage of ErbB4 , suggesting that P78536 was involved . After ErbB4 cleavage , the activation of P29323 by neuregulin 1 was almost completely inhibited . These results suggest that the down-regulation of ErbB4 expression is induced by G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation .
