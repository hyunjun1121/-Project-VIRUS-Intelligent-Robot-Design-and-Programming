Synaptically-competent neurons derived from canine embryonic stem cells by lineage selection with P01133 and Q13253 . Pluripotent stem cell lines have been generated in several domestic animal species ; however , these lines traditionally show poor self-renewal and differentiation . Using canine embryonic stem cell ( cESC ) lines previously shown to have sufficient self-renewal capacity and potency , we generated and compared canine neural stem cell ( cNSC ) lines derived by lineage selection with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) or Q13253 along the neural default differentiation pathway , or by directed differentiation with retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced floating sphere assay . Lineage selection produced large populations of P48431 + neural stem/progenitor cell populations and neuronal derivatives while directed differentiation produced few and improper neuronal derivatives . Primary canine neural lines were generated from fetal tissue and used as a positive control for differentiation and electrophysiology . Differentiation of P01133 - and Q13253 -directed cNSC lines in N2B27 with low-dose growth factors ( P23560 / P20783 or PDGFαα ) produced phenotypes equivalent to primary canine neural cells including 3CB2+ radial progenitors , Q8WUK0 + glia restricted precursors , P08670 +/ P14136 + astrocytes , and Q13509 +/ P11137 +/ P12036 +/ O15061 + neurons . Conversely , induction with RA and neuronal differentiation produced inadequate putative neurons for further study , even though appropriate neuronal gene expression profiles were observed by RT-PCR ( including P48681 , Q13509 , P78352 , Q16623 , Q8TBG9 , P11137 ) . Co-culture of cESC-derived neurons with primary canine fetal cells on canine astrocytes was used to test functional maturity of putative neurons . Canine ESC-derived neurons received functional GABA(A)- and AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic input , but only when co-cultured with primary neurons . This study presents established neural stem/progenitor cell populations and functional neural derivatives in the dog , providing the proof-of-concept required to translate stem cell transplantation strategies into a clinically relevant animal model .
