Pharmacologic suppression of hepatic O95477 activity in mice reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but promotes reverse cholesterol transport . BACKGROUND : The role of hepatic O95477 ( O95477 ) in maintaining plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels is well established , but its role in reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) is unclear . DB01599 is a compound that reduces HDL-C levels but also reduces atherosclerosis in animal models and xanthomas in humans . The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that probucol inhibits hepatic O95477 activity , thereby reducing HDL-C levels but promoting RCT from macrophages . METHODS AND RESULTS : Wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice and scavenger receptor class B type I ( Q8WTV0 ) knockout mice were fed a chow diet containing 0.5 % probucol or normal chow for 2 weeks . In WT mice , probucol , despite decreasing HDL-C by > 80 % , effectively maintained macrophage RCT . In Q8WTV0 knockout mice , probucol also substantially reduced HDL-C but significantly increased macrophage RCT . Furthermore , probucol significantly enhanced the excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol into feces in both WT and Q8WTV0 knockout mice . DB01599 inhibited O95477 -dependent cholesterol efflux from mouse primary hepatocytes , and this effect was shown to be responsible for the effect of probucol on increasing the fecal excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic O95477 activity with probucol reduced HDL-C levels but promoted RCT through diversion of HDL-derived cholesterol from efflux back into plasma instead to excretion in the bile . These results explain the beneficial effects of probucol on atherosclerosis and xanthomas despite its HDL-lowering effects and suggest that inactivation of hepatic O95477 leads to increased RCT despite reducing plasma HDL-C levels .
