P62942 , the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein , is a physiologic regulator of the cell cycle . P62942 , the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein , is a ubiquitous abundant protein that acts as a receptor for the immunosuppressant drug FK506 , binds tightly to intracellular calcium release channels and to the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) type I receptor . We now demonstrate that cells from P62942 -deficient ( P62942 (-/-) ) mice manifest cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase and that these cells can be rescued by P62942 transfection . This arrest is mediated by marked augmentation of P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) levels , which can not be further augmented by TGF-beta1 . The P38936 up-regulation and cell cycle arrest derive from the overactivity of TGF-beta receptor signaling , which is normally inhibited by P62942 . Cell cycle arrest is prevented by transfection with a dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor construct . TGF-beta receptor signaling to gene expression can be mediated by SMAD , p38 , and P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ) pathways . SMAD signaling is down-regulated in P62942 (-/-) cells . Inhibition of P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase fails to affect P38936 up-regulation . By contrast , activated phosphorylated p38 is markedly augmented in P62942 (-/-) cells and the P38936 up-regulation is prevented by an inhibitor of p38 . Thus , P62942 is a physiologic regulator of cell cycle acting by normally down-regulating TGF-beta receptor signaling .
