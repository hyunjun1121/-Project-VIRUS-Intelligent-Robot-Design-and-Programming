Expression of cell adhesion molecules and common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen in hepatoblastoma . Hepatoblastoma is an embryonal tumour of the liver , which often contains tissue components with multidirectional differentiation . The occurrence of cell surface antigens in this tumour has not been studied systematically , and we therefore investigated 20 hepatoblastomas for the expression of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen ( P08473 ) and cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) in their different tissue components . Epithelial tumour cells of fetal differentiation contained P12830 . This protein did not occur in tumour areas with embryonal or mesenchymal differentiation . In contrast , immature embryonal and anaplastic cells expressed P08473 and the hyaluronate receptor ( HCAM , P16070 ) . Both fetal and embryonal areas stained irregularly positive for P05362 , which , in contrast , was not present on anaplastic cells . Immature fibrous tissue did not contain any of these molecules except for P05362 . However , some cells adjacent to , or enclosed in , osteoid were positive for HCAM and P13591 . Like small undifferentiated hepatoblastoma cells , primitive mesenchymal spindle-shaped cells also expressed P08473 , HCAM , and the polysialylated embryonic form of P13591 strongly . This last is not present on other epithelial or mesenchymal tumour cells . Hepatoblastoma cells of varying differentiation express distinct patterns of CAMs and P08473 . Our results give further insight into their histogenesis and cellular interactions and may explain their variable ability for invasive growth and formation of metastases .
