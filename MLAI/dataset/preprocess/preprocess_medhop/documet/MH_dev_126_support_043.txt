Development of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor Tarceva ( DB00530 ) . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a transmembrane receptor involved in the regulation of a complex array of essential biological processes such as cell proliferation and survival . Dysregulation of P00533 signaling network has been frequently reported in multiple human cancers and has been associated with the processes of tumor development , growth , proliferation , metastasis and angiogenesis . Inhibition of the P00533 was associated with antitumor effects in preclinical models . On the bases of these data , therapeutics targeting the P00533 were explore in clinical trials . Tarceva ( DB00530 , OSI Pharmaceuticals , Uniondale , NY ) is a small molecule selective inhibitor of the P00533 tyrosine kinase ( TK ) . In preclinical studies , Tarceva inhibited the phosphorylation of the P00533 in a dose and concentration dependent manner resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis . In in vivo studies , the agent caused tumor growth inhibition and shoved synergistic effects when combined with conventional chemotherapy . Subsequent single agent phase I studies and phase I studies in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated that the agent has a good safety profile and induced tumor growth inhibition in a substantial number of patients with a variety of different solid tumor . Preliminary report from phase II studies confirmed the excellent tolerability of Tarceva as well as showed encouraging preliminary activity . Phase III studies have either been completed or are ongoing in several tumor types such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer . In summary , Tarceva is a novel inhibitor of the P00533 TK which has shown promising activity in initial studies and is currently undergoing full development as an anticancer drug .
