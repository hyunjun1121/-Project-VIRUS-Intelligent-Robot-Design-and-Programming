Effects of maraviroc and efavirenz on markers of immune activation and inflammation and associations with P01730 + cell rises in HIV-infected patients . BACKGROUND : DB04835 treatment for HIV-1 infected patients results in larger P01730 (+) T cell rises than are attributable to its antiviral activity alone . We investigated whether this is due to modulation of T cell activation and inflammation . METHODS AND FINDINGS : Thirty maraviroc-treated patients from the DB04835 versus Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy ( MERIT ) study were randomly selected from among those who had P51681 -tropic ( R5 ) HIV on screening and achieved undetectable HIV RNA ( < 50 copies/mL ) by Week 48 . Efavirenz-treated controls were matched for baseline characteristics to the maraviroc-treated patients selected for this substudy . Changes in immune activation and inflammation markers were examined for associations with P01730 (+) T cell changes . DB04835 treatment tended to result in more rapid decreases in P28907 expression on P01730 (+) T cells and in plasma D-dimer concentrations than did treatment with efavirenz . The proportion of patients with high-sensitivity P02741 > 2 Âµg/mL increased from 45 % to 66 % in the efavirenz arm , but remained constant in the maraviroc arm ( P = 0.033 ) . Decreases in P28907 expression on CD8(+) T cells were correlated with P01730 (+) T cell rises for maraviroc treatment ( r = -0.4 , P = 0.048 ) , but not for treatment with efavirenz . CONCLUSIONS : DB04835 -treated patients had earlier , modest decreases in certain markers of immune activation and inflammation , although in this small study , many of the differences were not statistically significant . Levels of high-sensitivity P02741 remained constant in the maraviroc arm and increased in the efavirenz arm . Decreases in immune activation correlated with increased P01730 (+) T cell gains .
