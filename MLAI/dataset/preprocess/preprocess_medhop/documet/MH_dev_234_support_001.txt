Gene amplification is a poor prognostic factor in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas . Various gene amplifications have been observed in gliomas . Prognostic-genomic correlations testing simultaneously all these amplified genes have never been conducted in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas . A set of 38 genes that have been reported to be amplified in gliomas and investigated as the main targets of amplicons were studied in a series of 52 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas using bacterial artificial chromosome-array based comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction . Among the 38 target genes , 15 were found to be amplified in at least one tumor . Overall , 27 % of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas exhibited at least one gene amplification . The most frequently amplified genes were epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/sarcoma amplified sequence ( P11802 /SAS ) in 17 % and 8 % of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas , respectively . Gene amplification and codeletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q were perfectly exclusive ( p = 0.005 ) . In uni- and multivariate analyses , gene amplification was a negative prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas , providing complementary information to the classic prognostic factors identified in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas ( extent of surgery , KPS , and chromosome arms 1p/19q status ) .
