Genomic structure and chromosome location of the murine Q01064 phosphodiesterase gene . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) catalyze the hydrolysis of DB02527 and cGMP , thereby participating in regulation of the intracellular concentrations of these second messengers . The PDE1 family is defined by regulation of activity by calcium and calmodulin . We have cloned and characterized the mouse Q01064 gene , which encodes the 63-kDa calcium/calmodulin-dependent PDE ( P62158 -PDE ) , an isozyme that is expressed in the CNS in the olfactory tract , dentate gyrus , and striatum and may participate in learning , memory , and regulation of phosphorylation of Q9UD71 in dopaminergic neurons . We screened an I-129/SvJ mouse genomic library and identified exons 2-13 of the Q01064 gene that span 8.4 kb of genomic DNA . Exons range from 67 to 205 nucleotides and introns from 91 to 2250 nucleotides in length . Exon 1 was not present in the 3 kb of genomic DNA 5' to exon 2 in our clones . The mouse Q01064 gene shares many similar or identical exon boundaries as well as considerable sequence identity with the rat Q07343 and Q08499 genes and the Drosophila dunce DB02527 -specific PDE gene dnc , suggesting that these genes all arose from a common ancestor . Using fluorescence in situ hybridization , we localized the Q01064 gene to the distal tip of mouse Chromosome ( Chr ) 15 .
