DB04868 and MEK inhibitors induce synthetic lethality through paradoxical activation of RAF in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia . We show that imatinib , nilotinib , and dasatinib possess weak off-target activity against RAF and , therefore , drive paradoxical activation of P15056 and CRAF in a DB01367 -dependent manner . Critically , because DB01367 is activated by P11274 - P00519 , in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells , DB01367 activity persists in the presence of these drugs , driving paradoxical activation of P15056 , CRAF , MEK , and P29323 , and leading to an unexpected dependency on the pathway . Consequently , nilotinib synergizes with MEK inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells and block tumor growth in mice . Thus , we show that imatinib , nilotinib , and dasatinib drive paradoxical RAF/MEK/ P29323 pathway activation and have uncovered a synthetic lethal interaction that can be used to kill drug-resistant CML cells in vitro and in vivo .
