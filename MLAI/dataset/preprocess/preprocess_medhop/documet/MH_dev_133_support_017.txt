Dynamic coregulatory complex containing P38398 , Q01094 and Q99708 controls Q13315 transcription . Chromosomal instability is a key feature in cancer progression . Recently we have reported that P38398 regulates the transcription of several genes in prostate cancer , including Q13315 ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) . Although it is well accepted that Q13315 is a pivotal mediator in genotoxic stress , it is unknown whether Q13315 transcription is regulated during the molecular response to DNA damage . Here we investigate Q13315 transcription regulation in human prostate tumor PC3 cell line . We have found that doxorubicin and mitoxantrone repress Q13315 transcription in PC3 cells but etoposide and methotrexate do not affect Q13315 expression . We have demonstrated that P38398 binds to Q13315 promoter and after doxorubicin exposure , it is released . P38398 overexpression increases Q13315 transcription and this enhancement is abolished by P38398 depletion . Moreover , P38398 -BRCT domain loss impairs the ability of P38398 to regulate Q13315 promoter activity , strongly suggesting that BRCT domain is essential for Q13315 regulation by P38398 . P38398 -overexpressing PC3 cells exposed to KU55933 Q13315 kinase inhibitor showed significant decreased Q13315 promoter activity compared to untreated cells , suggesting that Q13315 transcriptional regulation by P38398 is partially mediated by the Q13315 kinase activity . In addition , we have demonstrated Q01094 binding to Q13315 promoter before and after doxorubicin exposure . Q01094 overexpression diminishes Q13315 transcription after doxorubicin exposure which is impaired by Q01094 dominant negative mutants . Finally , the co-regulator of transcription Q99708 increases Q13315 transcription . Q99708 increases Q13315 transcription . Altogether , P38398 / Q01094 / Q99708 binding to Q13315 promoter activates Q13315 transcription . Doxorubicin exposure releases P38398 and Q99708 from Q13315 promoter still keeping Q01094 recruited and , in turn , represses Q13315 expression .
