Clinical implications of pathophysiological and demographic covariates on the population pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine , a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate in development for treatment of P04626 -positive cancers . DB05773 has been tested as a single agent in a phase I and 2 phase II studies of patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , with the maximum tolerated dose established at 3.6 mg/kg intravenously for every-3-week dosing . The authors present results from the population pharmacokinetics analysis for DB05773 . Population pharmacokinetics for DB05773 were characterized using a clinical database of 273 patients from the 3 studies . Pharmacokinetics was best described by a linear 2-compartment model . Population estimates ( interindividual variability [ IIV ] ) for pharmacokinetic parameters were clearance , 0.7 L/d ( 21.0 % ) ; central compartment volume ( V(c) ) , 3.33 L ( 13.2 % ) ; peripheral compartment volume ( V(p) ) , 0.89 L ( 50.4 % ) ; and intercompartmental clearance , 0.78 L/d . Body weight , albumin , tumor burden , and aspartate aminotransferase levels were identified as statistically significant covariates accounting for interindividual variability in DB05773 pharmacokinetics , with body weight having a greater effect on IIV of clearance and V(c) than other covariates . DB05773 exposure was relatively consistent across the weight range following body weight-based dosing . This analysis suggests no further DB05773 dose adjustments are necessary in heavily pretreated patients with MBC .
