Clinical utility of vilazodone for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder and theoretical implications for future clinical use . BACKGROUND : DB06684 is the latest approved antidepressant available in the United States . Its dual mechanism of action combines the inhibition of serotonin transporters while simultaneously partially agonizing serotonin-1a ( P08908 ) receptors . This combined activity results in serotonin facilitation across the brain 's serotonergic pathways , which has been termed by the authors as that of a serotonin partial agonist and reuptake inhibitor , or SPARI . OBJECTIVE : The authors to review laboratory , animal model data , and human trial data to synthesize a working theory regarding the mechanism of antidepressant action of this agent and regarding its potential for additional indications . METHODS : A MEDLINE and Internet search was conducted and the resultant evidence reviewed . RESULTS : DB06684 has randomized , controlled empirical data which has garnered it an approval for treating major depressive disorder . It combines two well-known pharmacodynamic mechanisms of serotonergic action into a novel agent . Although no head-to-head studies against other antidepressants are published , the efficacy data for vilazodone appears comparable to other known antidepressants , with associated gastrointestinal side effects similar to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants , but potentially with a lower incidence of sexual side effects and weight gain . DISCUSSION : As a new option for the treatment of major depressive disorder , vilazodone , due to its unique SPARI mechanism of action , may hold promise for patients who can not tolerate or have not responded to previous antidepressant monotherapies . Additionally , its use may extend to the treatment of other mental health conditions similar to those treated by serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors .
