Slow overmethylation of housekeeping genes in the body mucosa is associated with the risk for gastric cancer . Helicobacter pylori infection increases age-related diverse overmethylation in gene-control regions , which increases the risk of gastric cancer . The H. pylori-associated overmethylation changes subsequently disappear when gastric atrophy and cancer develop . To identify cancer-risk epigenotypes , we traced dynamic methylation changes in the background mucosa of the stomach depending on the extent of gastric atrophy . Paired biopsy specimens were obtained from the noncancerous antrum and body mucosa of 102 patients with cancer and 114 H. pylori-positive and 112 H. pylori-negative controls . The grade of gastric atrophy was evaluated using the endoscopic atrophic border score . The methylation-variable sites at the CpG-island margins and near the transcriptional start sites lacking CpG islands were semiquantitatively analyzed by radioisotope-labeling methylation-specific PCR . We selected eight housekeeping genes adjacent to Alu ( CDH1 , Q8NCT1 , P37231 , and Q9UL33 ) or LTR retroelements ( P08253 , CDKN2A , Q13950 , and Q13761 ) and eight stomach-specific genes ( Q03403 , P20142 , P51164 , P04155 , Q07654 , Q9UBU3 , DB00158 , and P20648 ) . Analysis of age-related methylation in the H. pylori-positive controls revealed slow overmethylation in the body and in the LTR-adjacent genes . A high-frequency overmethylation defined based on the slowly overmethylated genes was frequently observed in the body of patients with gastric cancer with open-type atrophy ( OR , 12.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 3.2-49.8 ) . The rapidly changing methylation of Alu-adjacent genes was barely increased in the antrum of patients with gastric cancer . Among diverse methylation changes associated with H. pylori infection , an increase in slowly changing methylation could serve as a cancer-risk marker .
