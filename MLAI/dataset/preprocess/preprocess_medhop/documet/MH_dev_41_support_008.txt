Real life experience with alemtuzumab treatment of patients with lower-risk P43034 and a hypocellular bone marrow . Immunosuppressive therapy is a therapeutic option for selected low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) patients . Besides standard treatment protocols that include ATG and Q13216 , the humanized P31358 antibody alemtuzumab has been shown to have efficacy in P43034 treatment . We report our experience with alemtuzumab in nine P43034 RCMD patients . All patients had a hypocellular bone marrow with a blast count < 5 % and were classified as intermediate-1 according to the IPSS . We found a response in five patients ( 60 % ) ; three patients achieved a complete remission 3 and 6 months after the treatment with alemtuzumab , and two patients showed a haematological improvement . DB00087 was administered in a 10-mg dosage for 10 days . Treatment was well tolerated , and no severe side effects were observed . We could confirm the finding that the alemtuzumab is effective and save selected P43034 patients . Due to the promising results , further studies , especially with regard to long-term survival and risk of leucemic progression should be initiated .
