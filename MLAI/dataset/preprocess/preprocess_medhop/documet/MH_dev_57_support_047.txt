Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) inhibits migration and invasion of human gastric cancer AGS cells via suppressing P29323 signal pathways . Metastasis suppressors and associated other regulators of cell motility play a critical initial role in tumor invasion and metastases . Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) is a hydrolysis compound of glucotropaeolin in dietary cruciferous vegetables . BITC has been found to exhibit prevention of cancers in laboratory animals and might also be chemoprotective in humans . Here , the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BITC on cell proliferation , migration , invasion and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways of AGS human gastric cancer cells . Wound healing and Boyden chamber ( migration and invasion ) assays demonstrated that BITC exhibited an inhibitory effect on the abilities of migration and invasion in AGS cancer cells . BITC suppressed cell migration and invasion of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner . Results from Western blotting indicated that BITC exerted an inhibitory effect on the P27361 /2 , Ras , P62993 , Rho A , P35228 , P35354 for causing the inhibitions of P08253 , -7 and -9 then followed by the inhibitions of invasion and migration of AGS cells in vitro . BITC also promoted O14733 , Q99759 , c-jun , P45983 /2 , P15692 , Sos1 , phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , PKC , nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-ÎºB ) p65 in AGS cells . Results from real-time polymerized chain reaction ( PCR ) showed that BITC inhibited the gene expressions of P08253 ,-7 -9 , Q05397 , Q13464 and RhoA after BITC treatment for 24 and 48 hours in AGS cells . Taken together , the finding may provide new mechanisms and functions of BITC , which inhibit migration and invasion of human gastric cancer AGS cells .
