Allele C-specific methylation of the 5- Q13049 receptor gene : evidence for correlation with its expression and expression of DNA methylase P26358 . Differential DNA methylation has been suggested to contribute to differential activity of alleles C and T and thereby to genetic associations between the C/T(102) polymorphism in the 5- Q13049 receptor gene ( 5HT2AR ) and psychiatric disorders . We surveyed methylation in two CpG sites , which are specific to allele C . The majority of allele C-specific CpG sites were methylated in human temporal cortex and peripheral leukocytes and levels of methylation varied between individuals . Levels of methylation in the promoter correlated significantly with the expression of 5HT2AR . Methylation of allele C-specific CpG sites in the first exon correlated significantly with the expression of DNA methylase 1 ( P26358 ) but not S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase ( P23526 ) . These findings support the hypothesis that allele-specific DNA methylation is involved in regulation of 5HT2AR expression , influencing expression differences between alleles C and T .
