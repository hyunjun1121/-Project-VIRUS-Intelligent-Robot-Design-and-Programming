The Retinoic Acid Receptor-alpha mediates human T-cell activation and Th2 cytokine and chemokine production . BACKGROUND : We have recently demonstrated that all-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) and 9-cis-retinoic acid ( 9-cis RA ) promote P05112 , P05113 and P35225 synthesis , while decreasing P01579 and P01375 expression by activated human T cells and reduces the synthesis of IL-12p70 from accessory cells . Here , we have demonstrated that the observed effects using DB00755 and 9-cis RA are shared with the clinically useful RAR ligand , 13-cis retinoic acid ( 13-cis RA ) , and the retinoic acid receptor-alpha ( P10276 ) -selective agonist , AM580 but not with the P10826 /gamma ligand , 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide ( DB05076 ) . RESULTS : The increase in type 2 cytokine production by these retinoids correlated with the expression of the T cell activation markers , Q07108 and P28907 . The P10276 -selective agonist , AM580 recapitulated all of the T cell activation and type 2 cytokine-inducing effects of DB00755 and 9- DB00982 , while the P10276 -selective antagonist , RO 41-5253 , inhibited these effects . CONCLUSION : These results strongly support a role for P10276 engagement in the regulation of genes and proteins involved with human T cell activation and type 2 cytokine production .
