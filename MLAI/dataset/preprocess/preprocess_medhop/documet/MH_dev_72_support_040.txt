DB00428 -nicotinamide-induced diabetes in the rat . Characteristics of the experimental model . Administration of both streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) and nicotinamide ( NA ) has been proposed to induce experimental diabetes in the rat . Q11206 is well known to cause pancreatic B-cell damage , whereas NA is administered to rats to partially protect insulin-secreting cells against Q11206 . Q11206 is transported into B-cells via the glucose transporter P11168 and causes DNA damage leading to increased activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( P09874 ) to repair DNA . However , exaggerated activity of this enzyme results in depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and DB00171 , and the insulin-secreting cells undergo necrosis . The protective action of NA is due to the inhibition of P09874 activity . NA inhibits this enzyme , preventing depletion of NAD(+) and DB00171 in cells exposed to Q11206 . Moreover , NA serves as a precursor of NAD(+) and thereby additionally increases intracellular NAD(+) levels . The severity of diabetes in experimental rats strongly depends on the doses of Q11206 and NA given to these animals . Therefore , in diabetic rats , blood glucose may be changed in a broad range -- from slight hyperglycemia to substantial hyperglycemia compared with control animals . Similarly , blood insulin may be only slightly decreased or substantial hypoinsulinemia may be induced . In vitro studies demonstrated that the insulin-secretory response to glucose is attenuated in Q11206 -NA-induced diabetic rats compared with control animals . This is due to reduced B-cell mass as well as metabolic defects in the insulin-secreting cells . Results of numerous experiments have demonstrated that this model of diabetes is useful in studies of different aspects of diabetes .
