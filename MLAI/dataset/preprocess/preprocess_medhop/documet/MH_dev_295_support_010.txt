DB01645 stimulates duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion through PI3K pathway in mice . DB01645 has been proposed as a promising pharmacotherapeutic for cystic fibrosis . We recently found that genistein stimulates murine duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . The aim of the present study was to determine the intracellular signal pathways involved in genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion . Murine duodenal mucosal HCO(3)(-) secretion was examined in vitro in Ussing chambers by the pH-stat technique . The results showed that neither DB02527 -dependent signal pathway inhibitors MDL-12330A and KT-5720 , nor cGMP signal pathway inhibitors NS2028 and KT5823 , nor calcium signal pathway inhibitors verapamil and W-13 , altered genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion . In calcium-free solution , genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion was not altered either . Vanadate , an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase , only partially inhibited genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion . However , both wortmannin and LY294002 , two structurally and mechanistically distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors , markedly inhibited genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion . DB01645 increased duodenal mucosal PI3K activity and induced the phosphorylation of Akt , a signaling molecule downstream of PI3K , which was again inhibited by wortmannin . P03372 antagonist , ICI182,780 , also markedly inhibited genistein-stimulated duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion and genistein-induced PI3K activity increase in duodenal mucosa . These results demonstrate that genistein stimulates duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion mainly through estrogen receptor and PI3K-dependent pathway . These findings contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of genistein-induced anion secretion and further pharmacotherapeutic development and use of genistein or related substances in the treatment of diseases of epithelial tissues .
