Fluvoxamine exerts anorexic effect in P28335 receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) 2C receptors and the downstream melanocortin pathway are suggested to mediate the anorexic effects of m-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP ) and fenfluramine . We previously reported that fluvoxamine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , together with pharmacological inactivation of P28335 receptors exert feeding suppression through activation of P28222 receptors in mice . Here , we report that fluvoxamine exerted anorexic effects in P28335 receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene ( 2CREnd mice ) , whereas fluvoxamine had no effect on food intake in age-matched wild-type mice and P28335 receptor mutant mice , which are associated with decreases in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) expression . mCPP suppressed food intake in P28335 receptor mutant mice , 2CREnd mice and age-matched wild-type mice . These results suggest that fluvoxamine-induced feeding suppression requires a perturbation of P28335 receptor and beta-endorphin signalling plus functional hypothalamic P01189 activity , whereas mCPP-induced feeding suppression does not always require functional P28335 receptor , beta-endorphin , and P01189 activity in mice .
