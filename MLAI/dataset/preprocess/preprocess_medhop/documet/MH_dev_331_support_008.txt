Modulation of acute graft-versus-host-disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 alpha ) release in the course of pretransplant conditioning : role of conditioning regimens and prophylactic application of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing human P01375 alpha ( DB04956 ) . Contribution of host-related cytokine release in the course of pretransplant conditioning to early tissue damage and induction of acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) has been shown in experimental models . We performed a clinical phase I/II trial applying a monoclonal antibody neutralizing human tumor necrosis alpha ( P01375 alpha ) during pretransplant conditioning as additional prophylaxis in high-risk patients admitted to allogeneic BMT ; P01375 alpha serum levels and clinical courses in 21 patients receiving anti- P01375 alpha prophylaxis were compared with data from 22 historical controls . Absence of significant release of P01375 alpha in the period of busulphan ( BUS ) treatment , but significant induction of P01375 alpha by total body irradiation ( TBI ) and cyclophosphamide ( CY ) conditioning were correlated with significantly earlier onset of acute GVHD in patients receiving TBI/CY regimens as compared with BUS/CY-treated patients . Prophylactic application of monoclonal anti- P01375 alpha seemed to postpone onset of acute GVHD from day 15 to day 25 ( P < .05 ) after TBI/CY and from day 33 to day 53 after BUS/CY ( P < .10 ) conditioning . Application of monoclonal anti- P01375 alpha in low and intermediate doses was safe and not associated with an increased incidence of infectious or hematologic complications . Thus , our data provide indirect and direct evidence for involvement of conditioning-related cytokine release in induction of early acute GVHD in the clinical setting and support further investigation of this novel approach in randomized trials .
