O60674 - P40763 blockade by AG490 suppresses autoimmune arthritis in mice via reciprocal regulation of regulatory T Cells and Th17 cells . P05231 -mediated P40763 signaling is essential for Th17 differentiation and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis . To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the antirheumatic effects and T cell regulatory effects of P40763 inhibition , we studied the effects of the JAK 2 inhibitor AG490 on Th17 cell/regulatory T cell ( Treg ) balance and osteoclastogenesis . AG490 was administered to mice with collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) via i.p. injection , and its in vivo effects were determined . Differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines , including Q16552 , IL-1Î² , and P05231 , was analyzed by immunohistochemistry . Levels of phosphorylated P40763 and P42229 and differentiation of Th17 cells and Tregs after AG490 treatment in our CIA model were analyzed by immunostaining . In vitro development of Th17 cells and Tregs was analyzed by flow cytometry and real-time PCR . AG490 ameliorated the arthritic phenotype in CIA and increased the proportion of Foxp3(+) Tregs . In contrast , the proportion of Q16552 -producing T cells and levels of inflammatory markers were reduced in AG490-treated mice . Numbers of p- P40763 (+) P01730 (+) T cells and p- P42229 (+) P01730 (+) T cells were reduced and elevated , respectively , after treatment with AG490 . Furthermore , AG490 markedly increased the expression of molecules associated with Treg development ( Q9Y6W8 , programmed cell death protein 1 , P05362 , and CD103 ) . The development and function of osteoclasts were suppressed by AG490 treatment . Our results suggest that AG490 , specifically regulating the O60674 / P40763 pathway , may be a promising treatment for rheumatoid arthritis .
