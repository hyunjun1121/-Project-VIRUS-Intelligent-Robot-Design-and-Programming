DB00398 -associated remission of psoriasis in hypernephroma : case report . Psoriasis is a disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation that results in the formation of lesional plaques covered by scale . Psoriasis is thought to be angiogenesis dependent . Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a hypervascularized solid tumor associated with loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) tumor suppressor gene and increased P04049 activity . A 68-year-old man who suffered from recalcitrant psoriasis for over 50 years was treated with sorafenib for metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma . One month later , his psoriasis , previously 8 x 6 cm on the mid posterior thorax , completely resolved . DB00398 works by inhibiting several receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) ) . It also inhibits intracellular Raf kinase ( P04049 ) , which targets the ubiquitous mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) intracellular signal transduction pathway . We suggest that this patient 's remission of psoriasis could be related to the inhibition/modulation of P15692 , P09619 , P04049 , and MAPK .
