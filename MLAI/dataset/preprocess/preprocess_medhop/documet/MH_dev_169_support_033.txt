P15018 functions as a growth factor in pancreas carcinoma cells : Involvement of regulation of P15018 and its receptor expression . P15018 ( P15018 ) is a pleiotrophic cytokine , which plays an important role in inducing cancer cachexia . We have previously reported that P15018 promotes cell proliferation in some human carcinoma cells through c-fos , jun-B and cyclin-E expression . In the present study , we analyzed the regulation of P15018 and its receptor ( P42702 ) expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells . Seven pancreatic carcinoma cells expressed constitutively P15018 and its heterodimer receptor ( P42702 and P40189 ) mRNA in RPMI-1640 medium without FBS . The amount of P15018 immunoreactive protein was 132.5+/-52 pg/10(6) cells in culture supernatants without FBS . Pro-inflammatory cytokines , such as P01375 , IL-1beta , P05231 , P10145 , or P15018 , enhanced the expression of P15018 mRNA in Hs-700T and Hs-766T cells . Addition of P15018 significantly induced cell proliferation of Hs700T in 13 days P15018 dose-dependently . However , anti- P15018 IgG failed to suppress cell proliferation in Hs-700T cells . P15018 acted as a paracrine growth factor in Hs-700T cells , which expressed low amount of P15018 without stimuli . Cellular signal transductions by P15018 was down-regulated by inhibitors of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) , and Ca/ P62158 . P15018 induced phosphorylation of P40763 . Moreover , exogenous P15018 upregulated the expression of P42702 mRNA . Antisense P42702 oligonucleotide significantly suppressed cell growth in the presence of P15018 in Hs-700T cells . These results suggest that cytokine network might alter the expression and responsiveness to P15018 in tumor microenvironment .
