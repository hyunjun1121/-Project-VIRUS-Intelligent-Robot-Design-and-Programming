Store-operated Ca2+ entry ( SOCE ) induced by protease-activated receptor-1 mediates Q13586 protein phosphorylation to inhibit SOCE in endothelial cells through AMP-activated protein kinase and p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase . The Ca(2+) sensor Q13586 is crucial for activation of store-operated Ca(2+) entry ( SOCE ) through transient receptor potential canonical and Orai channels . Q13586 phosphorylation serves as an " off switch " for SOCE . However , the signaling pathway for Q13586 phosphorylation is unknown . Here , we show that SOCE activates AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) ; its effector p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38β MAPK ) phosphorylates Q13586 , thus inhibiting SOCE in human lung microvascular endothelial cells . Activation of AMPK using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside ( AICAR ) resulted in Q13586 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) -induced Ca(2+) entry . Furthermore , AICAR pretreatment blocked P25116 -induced increase in the permeability of mouse lung microvessels . Activation of SOCE with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform α1 but not α2 of the AMPK catalytic subunit . Moreover , knockdown of AMPKα1 augmented SOCE induced by thrombin . Interestingly , SB203580 , a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK , blocked Q13586 phosphorylation and led to sustained Q13586 -puncta formation and Ca(2+) entry . Of the three p38 MAPK isoforms expressed in endothelial cells , p38β knockdown prevented P25116 -mediated Q13586 phosphorylation and potentiated SOCE . In addition , inhibition of the SOCE downstream target P62158 kinase kinase β ( CaMKKβ ) or knockdown of AMPKα1 suppressed P25116 -mediated phosphorylation of p38β and hence Q13586 . Thus , our findings demonstrate that SOCE activates CaMKKβ-AMPKα1-p38β MAPK signaling to phosphorylate Q13586 , thereby suppressing endothelial SOCE and permeability responses .
