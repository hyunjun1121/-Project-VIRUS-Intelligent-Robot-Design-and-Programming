DB01268 treatment in pediatric patients with advanced GIST following failure of imatinib . BACKGROUND : DB01268 inhibits P10721 and other members of the split-kinase-domain family of receptor tyrosine kinases . DB01268 prolongs survival in adult patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . We report the experience with sunitinib in pediatric patients with advanced GIST following failure of imatinib . PROCEDURE : DB01268 therapy was provided through a treatment-use protocol . Patients were 10-17 years old at enrollment . All patients had GIST resistant to imatinib therapy . DB01268 was administered daily for 4 weeks in 6-week treatment cycles . P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( P16234 ) genotyping of tumor tissue were performed . RESULTS : One patient achieved a partial response , five patients had stable disease and one patient had progressive disease on sunitinib . The duration of disease stabilization was between 7 and 21+ months , with a mean of 15 months . Time to tumor progression was longer on sunitinib than on prior imatinib treatment for five of six patients . Two patients experienced grade 3 adverse events . All other adverse events were grade 1-2 . None of the five patients tested had mutations in P10721 or P16234 . CONCLUSION : DB01268 treatment was associated with substantial initial antitumor activity and acceptable tolerability in this group of pediatric patients with imatinib-resistant GIST .
