P00533 regulates osteoclast differentiation and survival through cross-talking with Q9Y6Q6 signaling . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) functions in various cellular physiological processes such as proliferation , differentiation , and motility . Although recent studies have reported that P00533 signaling is involved in osteoclast recruitment and formation , the molecular mechanism of P00533 signaling for the regulation of osteoclastogenesis remains unclear . We investigated the role of the P00533 in osteoclast differentiation and survival and show that the expression of the P00533 was highly up-regulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) during osteoclast differentiation . P00533 -specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors and P00533 knockdown blocked O14788 -dependent osteoclast formation , suggesting that P00533 signaling plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis . P00533 inhibition impaired the O14788 -mediated activation of osteoclastogenic signaling pathways , including c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , NF-kappaB , and Akt/protein kinase B ( P31749 ) . In addition , P00533 inhibition in differentiated osteoclasts caused apoptosis through caspase activation . Inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K ) -Akt/ P31749 pathway and subsequent activation of Q92934 and caspases-9 and -3 may be responsible for the P00533 inhibition-induced apoptosis . The P00533 physically associated with receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ( Q9Y6Q6 ) and Grb2-associated binder 2 ( Gab2 ) . Moreover , O14788 transactivated P00533 . These data indicate that P00533 regulates O14788 -activated signaling pathways by cross-talking with Q9Y6Q6 , suggesting that the P00533 may play a crucial role as a Q9Y6Q6 downstream signal and/or a novel type of Q9Y6Q6 co-receptor in osteoclast differentiation and survival .
