Imatinib mesylate : an innovation in treatment of autoimmune diseases . Imatinib mesylate is a selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor , which can inhibit P11274 /Abl , PDGF-R , c- P10721 , c-fms , TCR/Abl , Lck , P36888 and MAPKs activities on various cell types . On immune system , imatinib has antiproliferative activity and immunomodulatory effects in lymphocytes , macrophages , mast cells and dendritic cells with abrogating multiple signal transduction pathways involved in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases e.g. inhibiting IFN-γ , P01375 -α , IL-1β and Q16552 pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMPs secretion . To date , the efficacy of imatinib in numerous animal model of autoimmune diseases ( rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , autoimmune diabetes and glomerulonephritis ) has been demonstrated , but application of this drug in human autoimmune diseases should be tested in future clinical trials . This review provides an update on the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate in treatment of autoimmune diseases and its related recent patents that could be developed as a novel and available therapy for the management of the autoimmunity improvement .
