Recent advances in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Constitutively activating mutations in the P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α ( P16234 ) RTKs play a crucial role in the biology of gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) , and this disease has served as an effective model for targeting gain-of-function kinase mutations in cancer . Imatinib has entered the clinical arena in the last decade and substantially improved the outcome in these formerly untreatable cancers . However , most advanced GISTs responding to imatinib progress within 2-3 years due to heterogeneous subclones harboring a range of imatinib-resistant secondary P10721 mutations . DB01268 , and more recently , regorafenib , have obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of GISTs after imatinib failure , and thus expanded the treatment options in resistant disease . Within this framework , we present an evaluation of current GIST management , emphasizing the most recent advances in the field together with a discussion on future steps to be taken in refractory disease .
