Cav1.2 L-type Ca²⁺ channels mediate cocaine-induced P42261 trafficking in the nucleus accumbens , a long-term adaptation dependent on ventral tegmental area Ca(v)1.3 channels . AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the mesoaccumbal dopaminergic pathway has been implicated in persistent cocaine-induced behavioral responses ; however , the precise mechanism underlying these changes remains unknown . Utilizing cocaine psychomotor sensitization , we have examined phosphorylation of P42261 at key residues serine 845 ( S845 ) and S831 , as well as P42261 cell surface levels in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) of cocaine-preexposed mice and the role of brain-specific Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-type Ca²⁺ channels ( LTCCs ) , therein . We found higher basal levels of S845 phospho- P42261 ( P- P42261 ) and cell surface P42261 in the NAc following protracted withdrawal from cocaine exposure , changes that occur independently of LTCCs . In contrast , we found that a cocaine challenge that elicits expression of the cocaine-sensitized response increases S831 P- P42261 that further increases surface P42261 beyond the higher basal levels . Intra-NAc pharmacological manipulations indicate that the Ca(v)1.2-activated P62158 kinase II ( CaMKII ) mediates cocaine-induced increase in S831 P- P42261 and that both Ca(v)1.2-activated CaMKII and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( P28482 ) mediate the increase in P42261 cell surface levels specific to the sensitized response . Experiments using adenoassociated viral vectors expressing Ca(v)1.3 and P28482 siRNA further indicate that recruitment of the Ca(v)1.2 pathway in the NAc is dependent on ventral tegmental area Ca(v)1.3 LTCCs and P28482 . Together , these results identify candidate pathways that mediate cocaine-induced AMPAR plasticity in the NAc and provide a mechanism linking LTCCs and P42261 plasticity to cocaine-induced persistent behavioral changes .
