DB00575 prevents insulin resistance and hypertension in obese dogs . The role that the central sympathetic nervous system plays in the development of obesity hypertension and insulin was evaluated by feeding dogs a high fat diet with or without clonidine treatment . Thirteen adult mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented and randomly assigned to receive either a high fat diet and no clonidine ( n=6 ) or a high fat diet plus clonidine ( n=7 ) , 0.3 mg P55957 . Blood pressure , heart rate , plasma insulin , and electrolytes were measured daily . P01308 resistance was assessed with a multiple-dose euglycemic clamp ( 1 , 2 , and 30 mU. kg-1. min-1 ) before and after 1 , 3 , and 6 weeks of the high fat diet . DB00575 prevented the hypertension , tachycardia , and insulin resistance associated with feeding dogs the high fat diet but did not affect weight gain . The present study suggests that the central sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in the development of both insulin resistance and hypertension associated with feeding dogs a high fat diet .
