Therapeutic targeting of P04626 in breast cancer : understanding resistance in the laboratory and combating it in the clinic . P04626 gene amplification occurs in about one quarter of breast carcinomas ( BCs ) and identifies a distinct clinical subset of BC . The introduction in the clinic of DB00072 , a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) directed to the P04626 extracellular domain , has had a great impact on the therapeutic management of P04626 + BC . Yet , not all patients respond to DB00072 and resistance develops also among patients that initially benefit from DB00072 -based regimens . Pre-clinical studies have discovered several mechanisms through which tumor cells may escape from DB00072 -mediated P04626 inhibition . These include rewiring of the ErbB signaling network , loss of P04626 expression , expression of P04626 isoforms refractory to DB00072 inhibition , vicarious signaling by non-ErbB tyrosine kinases and constitutive activation of downstream signaling routes , such as the PI3K pathway . While the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to establishing DB00072 resistance in the clinical setting is not fully understood , much attention has been focused on abating resistance by achieving complete blockade of P04626 -containing dimers . This approach , propelled by the development of novel anti- P04626 therapeutics , has led to the recent approval of DB01259 , DB06366 and DB05773 as additional anti- P04626 therapeutics in BC . However , full success is far from being achieved and resistance to P04626 targeting remains a relevant problem in the clinical management of BC . Herein , we provide an overview of biological and molecular bases underpinning resistance to P04626 therapeutics in BC , discuss outstanding issues in the field of P04626 therapeutic targeting and elaborate on future directions of translational research on P04626 + breast cancer .
