Influenza H1N1 infection in a patient with psoriatic arthritis in treatment with DB00051 : a case report . In March 2009 was the beginning of an epidemic flue caused by avian influenza A virus H1N1 . The disease varies from mild to serious and fatal cases . There are many hypotheses explaining why this virus infection would be fatal . One of these is the impaired immune response of the infected patient . The use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may cause decreased immune response and greater susceptibility to infections . We presented a case of a patient using adalimumab that have developed H1N1 without complications . This is the first case of H1N1 in a patient using adalimumab reported in Brazil . We discuss the possibility that anti- P01375 may not predisposes to a serious form of the disease or fatal complications .
