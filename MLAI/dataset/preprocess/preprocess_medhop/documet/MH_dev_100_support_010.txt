Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase in respiratory diseases . DB00435 ( NO ) is a key physiological mediator and disturbed regulation of NO release is associated with the pathophysiology of almost all inflammatory diseases . A multitude of inhibitors of NOSs ( nitric oxide synthases ) have been developed , initially with low or even no selectivity against the constitutively expressed NOS isoforms , P29474 ( endothelial NOS ) and P29475 ( neuronal NOS ) . In the meanwhile these efforts yielded potent and highly selective P35228 ( inducible NOS ) inhibitors . Moreover , P35228 inhibitors have been shown to exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in a wide variety of acute and chronic animal models of inflammation . In the present mini-review , we summarize some of our current knowledge of inhibitors of the P35228 isoenzyme , their biochemical properties and efficacy in animal models of pulmonary diseases and in human disease itself . Moreover , the potential benefit of P35228 inhibition in animal models of P48444 ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , such as cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation , has not been explicitly studied so far . In this context , we demonstrated recently that both a semi-selective P35228 inhibitor { L-NIL [ N6-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine hydrochloride ] } and highly selective P35228 inhibitors ( GW274150 and BYK402750 ) potently diminished inflammation in a cigarette smoke mouse model mimicking certain aspects of human P48444 . Therefore , despite the disappointing results from recent asthma trials , P35228 inhibition could still be of therapeutic utility in P48444 , a concept which needs to be challenged and validated in human disease .
