DB00065 for refractory sarcoidosis . BACKGROUND AND AIM OF WORK : P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) appears to be an important cytokine in the inflammation of sarcoidosis . DB00065 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody which specifically inhibits P01375 . We investigated the efficacy of infliximab for the therapy of chronic , resistant sarcoidosis . METHODS : Patients with persistent symptomatic sarcoidosis despite corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents were selected for treatment with infliximab . Patients were treated initially and at 2 , 4 , and 12 weeks with 5 mg/kg of infliximab at each treatment . Index lesions , which had progressed despite corticosteroid therapy , were reevaluated at 16 weeks . RESULTS : Three patients were treated . In two patients , the index lesion was lupus pernio , which significantly improved with infliximab . The third patient had restrictive lung disease . At week 16 , there was a 26 % improvement in the vital capacity from pretreatment values . All patients tolerated the treatments well . CONCLUSIONS : DB00065 was associated with significant improvement in chronic sarcoidosis .
