Serotonin transporter , sex , and hypoxia : microarray analysis in the pulmonary arteries of mice identifies genes with relevance to human PAH . Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is up to threefold more prevalent in women than men . Female mice overexpressing the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ; P31645 + mice ) exhibit PAH and exaggerated hypoxia-induced PAH , whereas male P31645 + mice remain unaffected . To further investigate these sex differences , microarray analysis was performed in the pulmonary arteries of normoxic and chronically hypoxic female and male P31645 + mice . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was employed for validation of the microarray data . In relevant groups , immunoblotting was performed for genes of interest ( CEBPβ , Q16678 , and P01100 ) . To translate clinical relevance to our findings , CEBPβ , Q16678 , and P01100 mRNA and protein expression was assessed in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) derived from idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) patients and controls . In female P31645 + mice , multiple pathways with relevance to PAH were altered . This was also observed in chronically hypoxic female P31645 + mice . We selected 10 genes of interest for qRT-PCR analysis ( P01100 , CEBPβ , Q16678 , P08590 , HAMP2 , P02788 , P26678 , P01160 , P25874 , and P09871 ) , and 100 % concordance was reported . Protein expression of three selected genes , CEBPβ , Q16678 , P01100 , was also upregulated in female P31645 + mice . Serotonin and 17β-estradiol increased CEBPβ , Q16678 , and P01100 protein expression in PASMCs . In addition , CEBPβ , Q16678 , and P01100 mRNA and protein expression was also increased in PASMCs derived from IPAH patients . Here , we have identified a number of genes that may predispose female P31645 + mice to PAH , and these findings may also be relevant to human PAH .
