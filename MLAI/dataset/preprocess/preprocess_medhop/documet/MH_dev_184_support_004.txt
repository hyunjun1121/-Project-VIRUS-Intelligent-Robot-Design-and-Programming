Potential pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity of an endophytic Penicillium species . P16233 ( PL ) is considered as one of the safest target for diet-induced anti-obesity drug development . DB01083 is the only PL inhibitor approved for anti-obesity treatment till date . In the process of exploration of new PL inhibitors , we have screened culture filtrates of 70 endophytic fungi of medicinal plants using qualitative as well as quantitative in-vitro PL assays . The qualitative assays indicated potential PL inhibition in only three isolates , namely # 57 TBBALM , # 33 TBBALM and # 1 CSSTOT . Only ethyl acetate extracts of the culture filtrates of these isolates exhibited the PL inhibition . # 57 TBBLAM ethyl acetate extract of culture filtrate exhibited potential PL inhibition with an IC50 of 3.69 µg/ml which was comparable to the positive control , i.e. DB01083 exhibiting IC50 value of 2.73 µg/ml . Further molecular phylogenetic tools and morphological studies were used to identify the isolate # 57 TBBALM as Penicillium species .
