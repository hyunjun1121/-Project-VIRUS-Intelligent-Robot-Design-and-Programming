Osteopetrosis : genetics , treatment and new insights into osteoclast function . Osteopetrosis is a genetic condition of increased bone mass , which is caused by defects in osteoclast formation and function . Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms exist , but this Review focuses on autosomal recessive osteopetrosis ( ARO ) , also known as malignant infantile osteopetrosis . The genetic basis of this disease is now largely uncovered : mutations in Q13488 , P51798 , Q86WC4 , Q9Y5X0 and Q9Y4G2 lead to osteoclast-rich ARO ( in which osteoclasts are abundant but have severely impaired resorptive function ) , whereas mutations in O14788 and Q9Y6Q6 lead to osteoclast-poor ARO . In osteoclast-rich ARO , impaired endosomal and lysosomal vesicle trafficking results in defective osteoclast ruffled-border formation and , hence , the inability to resorb bone and mineralized cartilage . ARO presents soon after birth and can be fatal if left untreated . However , the disease is heterogeneous in clinical presentation and often misdiagnosed . This article describes the genetics of ARO and discusses the diagnostic role of next-generation sequencing methods . The management of affected patients , including guidelines for the indication of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( which can provide a cure for many types of ARO ) , are outlined . Finally , novel treatments , including preclinical data on in utero stem cell treatment , O14788 replacement therapy and denosumab therapy for hypercalcaemia are also discussed .
