P21728 , but not dopamine D2 receptor , is a critical regulator for acute cocaine-enhanced gene expression . OBJECTIVE : The aim of present study is to investigate the roles of dopamine receptor subfamilies and their subsequent molecular events in cocaine-enhanced gene expression in striatum . METHODS : Acute cocaine-treated mice models were build to address this issue . Specific antagonists for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors ( P35240 23390 and raclopride , respectively ) and specific inhibitor for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) kinase were pretreated . Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expressions of c-Fos , phosphorylated DB02527 response element binding ( p-CREB ) and phosphorylated Elk-1 ( p-Elk-1 ) in striatum . RESULTS : Acute cocaine injection significantly enhanced expressions of c-Fos , p-CREB and p-Elk-1 in the striatum . Notably , these enhancements were totally blocked to normal level by P35240 23390 pre-treatment , while no changes occurred in the presence of raclopride . Moreover , we found that dopamine D1 receptor was involved in acute cocaine-induced activation of P27361 /2 in the striatum . Blockade of this dopamine D1 receptor-dependent P27361 /2 activation by SL 327 could reduce cocaine-enhanced expressions of c-Fos , p-CREB and p-Elk-1 in the striatum . DISCUSSION : These results suggest that dopamine D1 receptor , but not dopamine D2 receptor , plays a critical role in regulating acute cocaine-enhanced gene expression in the striatum , and P27361 /2 pathway may contribute to this regulation .
