Antitumor activity of lenvatinib ( e7080 ) : an angiogenesis inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases in preclinical human thyroid cancer models . Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by blockading the vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy for thyroid cancer . DB09078 mesilate ( lenvatinib ) is a potent inhibitor of P15692 receptors ( P17948 -3 ) and other prooncogenic and prooncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases , including fibroblast growth factor receptors ( P11362 -4 ) , platelet derived growth factor receptor α ( PDGFRα ) , P10721 , and P07949 . We examined the antitumor activity of lenvatinib against human thyroid cancer xenograft models in nude mice . Orally administered lenvatinib showed significant antitumor activity in 5 differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) , 5 anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC ) , and 1 medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) xenograft models . DB09078 also showed antiangiogenesis activity against 5 DTC and 5 ATC xenografts , while lenvatinib showed in vitro antiproliferative activity against only 2 of 11 thyroid cancer cell lines : that is , RO82-W-1 and TT cells . Western blot analysis showed that cultured RO82-W-1 cells overexpressed P11362 and that lenvatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of P11362 and its downstream effector Q8WU20 . DB09078 also inhibited the phosphorylation of P07949 with the activated mutation C634W in TT cells . These data demonstrate that lenvatinib provides antitumor activity mainly via angiogenesis inhibition but also inhibits FGFR and P07949 signaling pathway in preclinical human thyroid cancer models .
