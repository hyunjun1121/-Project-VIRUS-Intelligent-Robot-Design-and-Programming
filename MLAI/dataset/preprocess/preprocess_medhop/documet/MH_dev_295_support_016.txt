DB01780 signaling reveals 14-3-3 protein function as a novel step in left-right patterning during amphibian embryogenesis . To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of morphogenetic signals by H+ flux during embryogenesis , we tested DB01780 -A ( FC ) , a compound produced by the fungus Fusicoccum amygdali Del . In plant cells , FC complexes with 14-3-3 proteins to activate H+ pumping across the plasma membrane . It has long been thought that FC acts on higher plants only ; here , we show that exposing frog embryos to FC during early development specifically results in randomization of the asymmetry of the left-right ( LR ) axis ( heterotaxia ) . Biochemical and molecular-genetic evidence is presented that 14-3-3-family proteins are an obligate component of Xenopus FC receptors and that perturbation of 14-3-3 protein function results in heterotaxia . The subcellular localization of 14-3-3 mRNAs and proteins reveals novel cytoplasmic destinations , and a left-right asymmetry at the first cell division . Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments , we show that P62258 protein is likely to be an endogenous and extremely early aspect of LR patterning . These data highlight a striking conservation of signaling pathways across kingdoms , suggest common mechanisms of polarity establishment between C. elegans and vertebrate embryos , and uncover a novel entry point into the pathway of left-right asymmetry determination .
