Insights into antifolate resistance from malarial P00374 -TS structures . Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase ( PfDHFR-TS ) is an important target of antimalarial drugs . The efficacy of this class of P00374 -inhibitor drugs is now compromised because of mutations that prevent drug binding yet retain enzyme activity . The crystal structures of PfDHFR-TS from the wild type ( TM4/8.2 ) and the quadruple drug-resistant mutant ( V1/S ) strains , in complex with a potent inhibitor WR99210 , as well as the resistant double mutant ( P04264 P21554 ) with the antimalarial pyrimethamine , reveal features for overcoming resistance . In contrast to pyrimethamine , the flexible side chain of WR99210 can adopt a conformation that fits well in the active site , thereby contributing to binding . The single-chain bifunctional PfDHFR-TS has a helical insert between the P00374 and TS domains that is involved in dimerization and domain organization . Moreover , positively charged grooves on the surface of the dimer suggest a function in channeling of substrate from TS to P00374 active sites . These features provide possible approaches for the design of new drugs to overcome antifolate resistance .
