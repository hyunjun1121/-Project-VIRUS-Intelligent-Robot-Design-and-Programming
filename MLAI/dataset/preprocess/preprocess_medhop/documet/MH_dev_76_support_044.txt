Vitamin D mediates its action in human colon carcinoma cells in a calcium-sensing receptor-dependent manner : downregulates malignant cell behavior and the expression of thymidylate synthase and survivin and promotes cellular sensitivity to DB00544 . Vitamin D ( VD ) protects against colon carcinogenesis by mechanisms not fully understood . We had earlier reported on the similarity in the biologic action of VD and that of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) in human colon carcinoma cells . At the molecular level , the P41180 gene contains 2 VD response elements and VD stimulates the expression of P41180 . In this study , we investigated on the relationship between VD action and P41180 function . We determined and compared the action of VD in human colon carcinoma cells ( P35520 , Moser , Caco-2 and HCT116 ) and their P41180 knocked-down counterparts . VD inhibited cellular proliferation , cellular invasion , and anchorage-independent growth and stimulated the expression of P38936 /Waf1 but not in P41180 knocked-down cells . These results demonstrate , for the first time , that the known tumor-suppressive function of VD requires functional P41180 and knocking down P41180 expression abrogated this function of VD . We recently reported that activation of P41180 in human colon carcinoma cells downregulated the expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and survivin and promoted a significant increase in sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs . We now demonstrate , for the first time , that VD suppressed the expression of TS and survivin , TS and survivin gene transcriptional activities and promoted a cytotoxic response to DB00544 in a P41180 -dependent manner . Ectopic expression of wild-type P41180 in colon carcinoma cells also inhibited the expression of TS and survivin and enhanced cellular sensitivity to DB00544 . VD , however , could no longer enhance cellular sensitivity to DB00544 in cells overexpressing P41180 .
