Design and synthesis of a rapamycin-based high affinity binding P62942 ligand . BACKGROUND : The immunosuppressants rapamycin , ascomycin , FK506 , and cyclosporin act by binding to a class of cytosolic proteins , the immunophilins . In the case of FK506 , ascomycin and cyclosporin , the target of the immunophilin-immunosuppressant complex is calcineurin ; in the case of rapamycin , the target is P42345 ( TOR/ P42345 ) . DB00877 , ascomycin and FK506 have a common domain responsible for binding to P62942 , their cellular receptor , and different effector domains that determine the target of the complex . Both domains are necessary for signal transduction and biological activity . RESULTS : A hybrid molecule containing the rapamycin-FK506-ascomycin binding domain and a peptide tether has been designed , synthesized and biologically evaluated . The designed compound binds to P62942 with high affinity but has no biological activity , as expected from its lack of an effector domain . CONCLUSIONS : The designed rapamycin-based P62942 ligand exhibits powerful binding properties but , unlike rapamycin , shows no activity in P05231 dependent B-cell proliferation and , in contrast to FK506 , shows no activity in the P60568 reporter assay . The modular nature of this designed molecule should make it possible to generate a series of compounds with effector domains for targeting either calcineurin or P42345 ( TOR/ P42345 ) or both , as potential biological tools and immunosuppressive agents .
