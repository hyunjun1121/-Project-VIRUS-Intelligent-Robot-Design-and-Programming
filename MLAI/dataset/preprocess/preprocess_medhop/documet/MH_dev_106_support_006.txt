The expression of the solute carriers Q14973 and O75051 -1 is regulated by cholesterol in HepG2 cells . Drug disposition and response are greatly determined by the activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters . While the knowledge in terms of CYP enzymes and efflux ABC transporters ( such as P08183 , P-glycoprotein ) is quite extensive , influx transporters are increasingly being unveiled as key contributors to the process of drug disposition . There is little information on the regulation of these proteins in human cells , especially as regards the effect of endogenous compounds . In this study , we analysed the expression of P08684 and three uptake transporters Q14973 ( Q14973 ) , P46721 / P46721 ( P46721 ) and O75051 -1 ( O15245 ) in HepG2 cells following treatment with cholesterol . While P08684 and P46721 expression was unaffected , cholesterol treatment led to increased levels of Q14973 and O75051 -1 mRNAs . Alterations in the functional characteristics and/or expression levels of drug transporters in the liver may conceivably contribute to the variability in drug oral bioavailability often observed in the clinical settings .
