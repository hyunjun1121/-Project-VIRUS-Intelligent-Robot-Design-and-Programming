DB08904 for the treatment of Crohn 's disease . In this article we provide a contemporary overview of available clinical data on certolizumab pegol , a pegylated anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha agent that comprises a uniquely small protein , and its emerging role as a therapy for Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . The results from a comprehensive clinical trial program suggest that certolizumab pegol offers rapid and sustained remission of moderate to severe CD . DB08904 is an effective and well-tolerated therapy both in patients who have already received biologics and in patients who are anti- P01375 na√Øve . Benefits of therapy include a stable dosing regimen , which allows for rapid induction of a clinical response followed by long-term maintenance of response and remission under one fixed dose . Treatment with certolizumab pegol has been shown to improve function and quality of life in patients with CD , and insights into the potential mechanisms by which certolizumab pegol effects a response in CD suggest that this agent may have the potential to slow or even modify disease progression . Early therapy is particularly effective and could help control CD progression and lessen the burden of disease on patients .
