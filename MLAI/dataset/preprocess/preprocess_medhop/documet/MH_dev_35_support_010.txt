Rapid modulation of spine morphology by the 5- Q13049 serotonin receptor through kalirin-7 signaling . The 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor is the most abundant serotonin receptor subtype in the cortex and is predominantly expressed in pyramidal neurons . The 5-HT(2A) receptor is a target of several hallucinogens , antipsychotics , anxiolytics , and antidepressants , and it has been associated with several psychiatric disorders , conditions that are also associated with aberrations in dendritic spine morphogenesis . However , the role of 5-HT(2A) receptors in regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis in cortical neurons is unknown . Here we show that the 5-HT(2A) receptor is present in a subset of spines , in addition to dendritic shafts . It colocalizes with P78352 and with multiple PDZ protein-1 ( O75970 ) in a subset of dendritic spines of rat cortical pyramidal neurons . O75970 is enriched in postsynaptic density ( A5PKW4 ) fractions , is targeted to spines in pyramidal neurons , and enhances the localization of 5-HT(2A) receptors to the cell periphery . 5-HT(2A) receptor activation by the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist DOI induced a transient increase in dendritic spine size , as well as phosphorylation of P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) in cultured cortical neurons . PAK is a downstream target of the neuronal Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( RacGEF ) kalirin-7 that is important for spine remodeling . O60229 -7 regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons but its role in neuromodulator signaling has not been investigated . We show that peptide interference that prevents the localization of kalirin-7 to the postsynaptic density disrupts DOI-induced PAK phosphorylation and spine morphogenesis . These results suggest a potential role for serotonin signaling in modulating spine morphology and kalirin-7 's function at cortical synapses .
