Extrinsic apoptosis is impeded by direct binding of the APL fusion protein P06748 -RAR to Q15628 . A subset of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cases has been characterized by the t(5;17)(q35;q21) translocation variant , which fuses nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) to retinoic acid receptor Î± ( P10276 ) . The resultant P06748 -RAR fusion protein blocks myeloid differentiation and leads to a leukemic phenotype similar to that caused by the t(15;17)(q22;q21) P29590 -RAR fusion . The contribution of the N-terminal 117 amino acids of P06748 contained within P06748 -RAR has not been well studied . As a molecular chaperone , P06748 interacts with a variety of proteins implicated in leukemogenesis . Therefore , a proteomic analysis was conducted to identify novel P06748 -RAR-associated proteins . P01375 receptor type I-associated DEATH domain protein ( Q15628 ) was identified as a relevant binding partner for P06748 -RAR . This interaction was validated by coprecipitation and colocalization analysis . Biologic assessment found that P06748 -RAR expression impaired P01375 -induced signaling through Q15628 , blunting P01375 -mediated activation of caspase-3 ( P42574 ) and caspase-8 ( Q14790 ) , to ultimately block apoptosis . IMPLICATIONS : This study identifies a novel mechanism through which P06748 -RAR affects leukemogenesis .
