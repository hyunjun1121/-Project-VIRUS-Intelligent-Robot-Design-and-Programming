Novel antimicrobial peptides from the venom of the eusocial bee Halictus sexcinctus ( Hymenoptera : Halictidae ) and their analogs . Two novel antimicrobial peptides , named halictines , were isolated from the venom of the eusocial bee Halictus sexcinctus . Their primary sequences were established by P19957 -QTOF mass spectrometry , Edman degradation and enzymatic digestion as DB00145 - DB00134 - DB00150 - DB00133 -Lys- DB00167 - DB00149 - DB00145 - DB00117 - DB00149 - DB00167 - DB00125 -NH2 ( P42357 -1 ) , and DB00145 -Lys- DB00150 - DB00134 - DB00133 - DB00149 - DB00149 -Lys- DB00117 - DB00167 - DB00149 -Lys-NH2 ( P42357 -2 ) . Both peptides exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but also noticeable hemolytic activity . The CD spectra of P42357 -1 and P42357 -2 measured in the presence of trifluoroethanol or SDS showed ability to form an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in an anisotropic environment such as bacterial cell membrane . NMR spectra of P42357 -1 and P42357 -2 measured in trifluoroethanol/water confirmed formation of helical conformation in both peptides with a slightly higher helical propensity in P42357 -1 . Altogether , we prepared 51 of P42357 -1 and P42357 -2 analogs to study the effect of such structural parameters as cationicity , hydrophobicity , alpha-helicity , amphipathicity , and truncation on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities . The potentially most promising analogs in both series are those with increased net positive charge , in which the suitable amino acid residues were replaced by Lys . This improvement basically relates to the increase of antimicrobial activity against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to the mitigation of hemolytic activity .
