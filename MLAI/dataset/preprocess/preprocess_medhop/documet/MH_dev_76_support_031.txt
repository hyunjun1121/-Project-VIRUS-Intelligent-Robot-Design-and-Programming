P38936 -activated kinase-aberrant activation and translocation in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis . Defects in dendritic spines and synapses contribute to cognitive deficits in mental retardation syndromes and , potentially , Alzheimer disease . P38936 -activated kinases ( PAKs ) regulate actin filaments and morphogenesis of dendritic spines regulated by the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 . We previously reported that active PAK was markedly reduced in Alzheimer disease cytosol , accompanied by downstream loss of the spine actin-regulatory protein Q16643 . beta-Amyloid ( Abeta ) oligomer was implicated in PAK defects . Here we demonstrate that PAK is aberrantly activated and translocated from cytosol to membrane in Alzheimer disease brain and in 22-month-old Tg2576 transgenic mice with Alzheimer disease . This active PAK coimmunoprecipitated with the small GTPase Rac and both translocated to granules . Abeta42 oligomer treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons induced similar effects , accompanied by reduction of dendrites that were protected by kinase-active but not kinase-dead PAK . Abeta42 oligomer treatment also significantly reduced N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit Q13224 phosphotyrosine labeling . The Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor Q99463 significantly blocked the PAK/Rac translocation but not the loss of p- Q13224 in Abeta42 oligomer-treated neurons . Src family kinases are known to phosphorylate the Rac activator Tiam1 , which has recently been shown to be Abeta-responsive . In addition , anti-oligomer curcumin comparatively suppressed PAK translocation in aged Tg2576 transgenic mice with Alzheimer amyloid pathology and in Abeta42 oligomer-treated cultured hippocampal neurons . Our results implicate aberrant PAK in Abeta oligomer-induced signaling and synaptic deficits in Alzheimer disease .
