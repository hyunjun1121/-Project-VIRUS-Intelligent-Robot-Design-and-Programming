New therapeutic approaches to the management of rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a common disease that affects up to 1 % of the population , and causes significant morbidity and early mortality . The aetiology of RA is unknown ; however , in the last 10 to 15 years significant advances in molecular technology have provided a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This has led to the development of new approaches to the treatment of RA . The disease modifying antirheumatic oral agent leflunomide inhibits the proliferation of activated T cells that are important in the inflammation and degradation of synovial tissues . The 2 biological agents approved for the treatment of RA , infliximab and etanercept , are inhibitors of the pro-inflammatory cytokine , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) . DB00065 is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal antibody which is administered by intravenous infusion and binds with high affinity to TNFalpha , thereby neutralising its effects . DB00005 is a recombinant , soluble P01375 receptor molecule which is administered subcutaneously and binds to TNFalpha in the serum rendering it biologically inactive . The protein A immunoadsorption column is a medical device that in conjunction with plasmapheresis can be used in patients with refractory RA . These agents have provided new and effective therapies for the treatment of patients with RA .
