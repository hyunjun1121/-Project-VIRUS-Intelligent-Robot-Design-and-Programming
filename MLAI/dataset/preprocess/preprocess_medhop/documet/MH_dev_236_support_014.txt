Interrelationship between signal transduction pathways and 1,25(OH)2D3 in UMR106 osteoblastic cells . In this study , the interrelationship between signal transduction pathways and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1,25(OH)2D3 ] action was examined in UMR106 osteoblastic cells . Treatment of these cells with 8-bromo- DB02527 ( 1 mM ) resulted in an upregulation of the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) and an augmentation in the induction by 1,25(OH)2D3 of DB00146 24-hydroxylase [ 24(OH)ase ] and osteopontin ( P10451 ) mRNAs as well as gene transcription . Transfection with constructs containing the vitamin D response element devoid of other promoter regulatory elements did not alter the DB02527 -mediated potentiation , suggesting that DB02527 -enhanced transcription is due , at least in part , to upregulation of P11473 . Treatment with phorbol ester [ 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) 100 nM ] , an activator of protein kinase C , significantly enhanced 1,25(OH)2D3-induced P10451 mRNA and transcription but had no effect on P11473 or on 24(OH)ase mRNA or transcription . Studies using P10451 promoter constructs indicate that TPA-enhanced P10451 transcription is mediated by an effect on the P10451 promoter separate from an effect on P11473 . Thus interactions with signal transduction pathways can enhance 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of 24(OH)ase and P10451 gene expression , and , through different mechanisms , changes in cellular phosphorylation may play a significant role in determining the effectiveness of 1,25(OH)2D3 on transcriptional control in cells expressing skeletal phenotypic properties .
