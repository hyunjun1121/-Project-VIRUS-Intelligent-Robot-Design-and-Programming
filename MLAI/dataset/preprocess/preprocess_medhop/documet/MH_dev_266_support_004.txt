Inhibition of P08908 receptor-dependent cell survival by DB02527 /protein kinase A : role of protein phosphatase 2A and Bax . Serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptor signaling leading to nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activation appears to be critical for cell survival . Adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A ( AC/PKA ) are effectors of the 5-HT(1A) receptor that are inhibited by Galpha(i) subunits . Conversely , Gbetagamma(i) subunits downstream from the 5-HT(1A) receptor participate in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( P27361 /2 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , Akt , and NF-kappaB . To model the contribution of pro- and antiapoptotic signaling cascades downstream of activated 5-HT(1A) receptor in cell survival , Chinese hamster ovarian ( CHO ) cells were employed that exogenously overexpress 5-HT(1A) receptors . Stimulation with the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and pharmacological agonists of AC induced PKA and protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) activity , which in turn inhibited : Akt activity , P25963 degradation , nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB , and expression of P98170 ( P98170 / P98170 ) . Pharmacological inhibition of PP2A with calyculin A potentiated Akt activity while attenuating P27361 /2 signaling via increased inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf ( pSer259 ) . In contrast , increased DB02527 levels enhanced Bax translocation to the mitochondria , resulting in the release of cytochrome c , caspase-3 activation , and apoptosis induction . Our data suggest a central role of DB02527 /PKA-dependent PP2A in shifting the homeostasis of intracellular signaling downstream of activated 5-HT(1A) receptor toward cell death in biological systems linked to neuropsychiatric disorders .
