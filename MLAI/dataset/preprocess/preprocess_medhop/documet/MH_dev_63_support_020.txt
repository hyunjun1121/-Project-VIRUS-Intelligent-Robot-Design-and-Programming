DB01645 potentiates the P01160 effect on a K(+)-conductance in P29320 -293 cells . P29320 -293 cells are known to reflect many features of the late distal tubule . Furthermore , they have the ability to release urodilatin , the structural analog to P01160 . RT-PCR was performed to test for the expression of natriuretic peptide receptors . While the mRNA for the human P01160 receptor ( P16066 , P16066 ) could be amplified , the P09543 -specific receptor P20594 ( P20594 ) and the receptor specific for guanylins , P25092 , could not be detected . In patch clamp experiments the effects of P01160 ( 10 nM ) on membrane voltage ( V(m) ) were monitored and P29320 -293 cells depolarized by 2.3 +/- 0.5 mV ( n=14 ) . In the presence of the P01133 receptor blocker genistein ( 10 microM ) the effect of P01160 was increased by 65 % to 3.9 +/- 0.8 mV ( n=14 ) . After removal of genistein the P01160 -mediated depolarization further increased by 147 % to 5.7 +/- 1.0 mV ( n=14 ) . P01160 given repetitively without genistein had no increasing depolarizing effect in P29320 -293 cells with time . The P01160 effect could be fully blocked by 1 mM Ba(2+) and by 1 microM of the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 indicating that P01160 inhibits a K(+)-conductance via a cGMP-dependent protein kinase . DB01645 itself hyperpolarized the membrane voltage of P29320 -293 cells by -3.9 +/- 0.6 mV ( n=11 ) and this effect could also be fully blocked by Ba(2+) ( -0.3 +/- 0.1 mV , n=5 ) , indicating that genistein activates a K(+)-conductance which contributes significantly to the membrane potential of P29320 -293 cells .
