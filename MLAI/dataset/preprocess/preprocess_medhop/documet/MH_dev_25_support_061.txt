Co-signals in organ transplantation . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The nonimmune effects of currently used immunosuppressive drugs result in a high incidence of late graft loss due to nephrotoxicity and death . As an immune-specific alternative to conventional immunosuppressants , new biotechnology tools can be used to block the costimulation signal of T-cell activation . RECENT FINDINGS : Many experimental studies , particularly preclinical studies in nonhuman primates , have focused on blocking ' classical ' P33681 / P10747 and P25942 / P29965 pathways , which are critical in primary T-cell activation , but also on new P33681 / P10747 and P01375 / P01375 -R pathways families of costimulatory molecules that can deliver positive or negative costimulation signals to regulate the alloimmune response . SUMMARY : DB06681 is a new fusion protein derived from P16410 -Ig that can be used to prevent acute rejection in renal transplantation instead of calcineurin inhibitors . DB06681 can also prevent acute rejection efficiently in humans and , more interestingly , can improve renal function and cardiovascular risk factors in this population .
