Characterization of the aggregation responses of camel platelets . BACKGROUND : Despite evidence of active hemostasis , camel platelets barely respond to common aggregating agents at standard doses used for human platelet aggregation . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of the study was to find out whether camel platelets can be activated by high doses or combinations of aggregation agonists , and to characterize the receptor that mediates the aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , the most potent agonist for camel platelets known so far . METHODS : Aggregation studies were performed with platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) in response to multiple doses or combinations of ADP , epinephrine ( P08473 ) , collagen , and arachidonic acid ( AA ) . Aggregation responses to ADP were performed before and after the addition of the ADP receptor ( Q9H244 ) antagonist DB00758 . RESULTS : Camel platelets responded to ADP at doses higher than the standard dose for human platelets , and to combinations of P08473 and other agonists , while no aggregation was elicited with P08473 or AA alone . DB00758 blocked the ADP-induced aggregation responses in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : Camel platelet aggregation can be activated by increasing the dose of some agonists such as ADP , but not AA or P08473 . Irreversible aggregation of camel platelets could also be triggered by a combination of P08473 and ADP , and collagen and AA . Inhibition with clopidogrel suggests that camel platelets express the ADP receptor , Q9H244 . Understanding platelet function in camels will add to the understanding of platelet function in health and disease .
