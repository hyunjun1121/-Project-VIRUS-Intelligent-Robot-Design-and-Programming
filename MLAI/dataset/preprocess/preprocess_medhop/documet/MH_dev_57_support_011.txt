Sesquiterpenoids from Atractylodes macrocephala act as farnesoid X receptor and progesterone receptor modulators . Two sesquiterpenoids , atractylenolide II and III , were isolated and identified from Atractylodes macrocephala ( Asteraceae ) to be subsequently evaluated for their activity against farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) and progesterone receptor ( PR ) by transient transfection reporter assays . These sesquiterpenoids did not exert significant agonistic effect but antagonized the activity of chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , an endogenous Q96RI1 agonist , for Q96RI1 driven Q15466 promoter transactivation . Additionally , they transactivated P22680 gene promoter activity by antagonizing Q96RI1 . Apart from acting as a Q96RI1 antagonist , atractylenolide III also showed agonistic activity against PR . All these results demonstrated that atractylenolide II and III are the active components of Atractylodes macrocephala to exert specific pharmacologic effects .
