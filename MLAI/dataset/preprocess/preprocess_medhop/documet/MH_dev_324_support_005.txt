Polymorphisms of the HTR1a allele are linked to frontal brain electrical asymmetry . Polymorphic variations in genes related to serotonin synthesis , transport , recognition , or degradation may convey subtle changes in serotonin system architecture that may place an individual at risk for psychopathology when faced with life stressors . The relationship between three key serotonin alleles and frontal brain electrical asymmetry , a putative endophenotype of depression , was examined . Risk alleles were hypothesized to predict relatively greater right frontal brain activity regardless of current clinical state . A sample of 313 college-age individuals , spanning a range of depressive severity from no symptomotology to clinically meaningful levels , participated . Resting encephalographic ( EEG ) activity was recorded from 64 scalp sites on four occasions separated by at least 24h ( two 8-min recording sessions occurring at each occasion ) . Alpha power asymmetry scores between homologous sites were calculated for each session and then averaged to form a trait metric of asymmetry for each pair . PCR based genotyping was conducted for the HTR1a , HTR2a , and HTTLPR genes . Variations in the HTR1a gene were related to trait EEG asymmetry , regardless of any history of depression . Compared to subjects with at least one non-risk allele , subjects with homozygous P08908 risk alleles had significantly greater relative right frontal activity at sites P08709 / P00451 , P12259 /F6 , and F1/F2 . In conclusion , variation in HTR1a can influence trait level brain activity , which may ultimately be indicative of risk for psychopathology .
