Effect of P14416 , 5- Q13049 , and P21964 genes on antipsychotic response to risperidone . DB00734 is a widely used atypical antipsychotic with certain advantages over typical antipsychotics . Although variations in the efficacy of treatment with risperidone have been observed , no specific predictable marker has been identified as of yet . In all , 73 Japanese patients with schizophrenia were given risperidone for 8 weeks , and clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . Six candidate polymorphisms ( P28223 -1438G > A , 102T > C , H452Y ; P14416 -141delC , Taq I A ; P21964 V158M ) were genotyped . The diplotype configuration for each individual was estimated by the maximum-likelihood method . Multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the effects of these haplotypes/genotype and other prognostic factors on PANSS scale performance . After adjustment for the effects of patient-related variables , P28223 diplotype and P21964 genotype , as well as other potential prognostic factors , did not significantly influence the clinical performance . A P14416 haplotype tended to correlate with better clinical performance . Compared with patients who had Ins-A2/Ins-A2 diplotype ( n=25 ) , PANSS total scores of patients with Ins-A2/Del-A1 diplotype ( n=10 ) showed 40 % greater improvement ( P=0.03 ) . The PANSS total scores of patients with P28223 A-T/A-T diplotype ( n=22 ) tended to show 15 % worse improvement compared with A-T/G-C diplotype ( n=33 ) ( P=0.06 ) . These results should be treated with caution because of limitations due to small sample size , heterogeneity of patients with respect to past antipsychotic use history , and no correction for multiple corrections . However , the present findings generate important hypotheses in a sample of Japanese schizophrenia patients that may lay the foundation for future pharmacogenomics investigations in other populations .
