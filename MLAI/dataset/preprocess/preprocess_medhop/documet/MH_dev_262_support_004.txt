DB06809 ( DB06809 ) alone to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from multiple myeloma patients for autologous transplantation . Rapid and durable recovery of hematopoietic function after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) requires the infusion of a sufficient number of hematopoietic stem cells ( P19526 ) . P09919 ( DB00099 ) , either alone or with chemotherapy , has been the traditional backbone of regimens used to mobilize P19526 . DB06809 ( previously known as DB06809 ) , a selective antagonist of P61073 , has recently been approved for autologous P19526 mobilization in combination with DB00099 . The current study assessed the safety and efficacy of plerixafor as a single agent when given subcutaneously and followed by apheresis 6 hours later for the mobilization of P19526 for transplantation in 9 patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) . All patients mobilized enough cells for at least 1 transplant , and demonstrated prompt recovery of hematopoietic function . Median time to engraftment was 10.5 days for neutrophils and 21 days for platelets . Significant adverse events were not observed . Recovery of peripheral blood cell counts was durable in all surviving patients . Despite these successes , mobilization with plerixafor alone was modest . However , in clinical circumstances where G- P04141 or chemotherapy based-mobilization should not be used , mobilization with plerixafor alone may be required and effective . Further research into single agent use should focus on alternate route of administration as well as adjustment of the timing of the apheresis to improve cell P19526 yield .
