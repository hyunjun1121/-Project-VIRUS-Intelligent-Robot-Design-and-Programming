The role of irreversible HER family inhibition in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer . Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) include the reversible epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 /HER-1 ) inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib . P00533 TKIs have demonstrated activity in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring activating P00533 mutations ; however , multiple mechanisms of resistance limit the benefit of these drugs . Although resistance to P00533 TKIs can be intrinsic and correlated with molecular lesions such as in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( P01116 ; generally observed in a wild-type P00533 background ) , acquired resistance to P00533 TKIs can evolve in the setting of activating P00533 mutations , such as in the case of P00533 T790M mutations . Several irreversible inhibitors that target multiple members of the HER family simultaneously are currently in clinical development for NSCLC and may have a role in the treatment of TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant disease . These include PF00299804 , an inhibitor of P00533 /HER-1 , HER-2 , and HER-4 , and afatinib ( DB08916 ) , an inhibitor of P00533 /HER-1 , HER-2 , and HER-4 . Results of large , randomized trials of these agents may help to determine their potential for the treatment of NSCLC .
