Up-regulation of the extracellular matrix remodeling genes , biglycan , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in familial amyloid polyneuropathy . Familial amyloid polyneuropathy ( FAP ) is characterized by extracellular deposition of transthyretin ( P02766 ) aggregates and amyloid fibrils , particularly in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) and is accompanied with changes in connective tissue . Given the invasiveness of nerve biopsy , FAP salivary glands ( SGs ) were used in microarray analysis ; biglycan and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( P80188 ) , two genes related to extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) remodeling were overexpressed in FAP . Results were validated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry both in SG and in nerve biopsies of different stages of disease progression . P14780 ( P14780 ) , which exists as a complex with P80188 , was also increased in FAP and in vitro degraded P02766 aggregates and fibrils ; however in the presence of serum amyloid P , a universal amyloid component , P02766 fibrils became resistant to P14780 proteolysis . P21810 , P80188 , and P14780 are transcriptionally up-regulated by NF-kappaB , a transcription factor that is activated in FAP nerves and SG . Given the relationship between inflammation and Q13201 remodeling , and the increase of proinflammatory cytokines in FAP , P22301 expression in FAP nerves was investigated ; P22301 increased after fibril deposition , suggesting a balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms . Changes in Q13201 -related proteins and inflammatory events may be relevant for therapy in FAP and other neurodegenerative disorders .
