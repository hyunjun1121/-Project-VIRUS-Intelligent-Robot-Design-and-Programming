[ Prominent features of management strategies in acute coronary syndromes with the new oral antiplatelet agents ] . The novel oral Q9H244 inhibitors ( prasugrel and ticagrelor ) have been incorporated into the recently updated acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) guidelines , as an adjunct antiplatelet treatment to aspirin . The studies involving the use of new oral antiplatelet agents that are more potent , predictable and faster platelet inhibitors than clopidogrel have demonstrated superiority with respect to the primary composite endpoint ( cardiovascular death , non-lethal myocardial infarction , stroke ) for both prasugrel and ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel . The subgroup analysis of the relevant studies showed that these new agents differ in their level of efficacy in different ACS patient subgroups : ( 1 ) Mortality was reduced with ticagrelor ; ( 2 ) DB08816 is especially more effective in intermediate-and high-risk non-ST elevation ACS patients in whom early invasive strategy is selected ; ( 3 ) Prasugrel should be especially preferred in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) after diagnostic angiography ; and ( 4 ) Prasugrel is more effective in diabetic patients . While clopidogrel is recommended for ACS patients who are followed with a non-invasive strategy or who have not undergone percutaneous revascularization , it is the last line choice or an alternative to the Q9H244 inhibitor therapy for patients undergoing invasive strategy .
