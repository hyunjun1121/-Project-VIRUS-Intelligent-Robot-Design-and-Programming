1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and a variety of its natural metabolites transcriptionally repress nuclear-factor-kappaB-mediated interleukin-8 gene expression . Regulation of interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) gene transcription occurs mainly through the sequences -94 to -71 of the 5'-flanking region of the P10145 gene , involving the transcription factors nuclear factor for interleukin-6 ( NF- P05231 ) and nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . The human melanoma cell line A3 was derived from G-361 cells by stable transfection with an P10145 promoter-luciferase construct containing these sequences . DB00136 ( calcitriol ) repressed P10145 promoter activity induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) by 50 % , compared to 30 % inhibition using dexamethasone , an effect consistent with its effect on P01375 -induced P10145 release and P10145 mRNA levels . A variety of vitamin D metabolites caused the same repressive effect on P10145 promoter activation as calcitriol . However , only those metabolites which were able to transactivate a classical vitamin D response element had the ability to repress P10145 promoter activation , suggesting that this repression is mediated via vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of P11473 in the parental G-361 cell line enhanced the repressive effect of calcitriol on activation of the P10145 promoter by either P01375 stimulation or overexpression of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from A3 cells showed that calcitriol decreased the abundance of nuclear factors bound to the NF-kappaB binding site of the P10145 promoter and this reduced binding of NF-kappaB proteins presumably contributes to its inhibitory action .
