A novel bile acid-activated vitamin D receptor signaling in human hepatocytes . Vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) is activated by natural ligands , 1alpha , 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D(3) [ 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-D(3) ] and lithocholic acid ( LCA ) . Our previous study shows that P11473 is expressed in human hepatocytes , and P11473 ligands inhibit bile acid synthesis and transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) . Primary human hepatocytes were used to study LCA and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-D(3) activation of P11473 signaling . Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy imaging and immunoblot analysis showed that LCA and 1alpha , 25(OH)(2)-D(3) induced intracellular translocation of P11473 from the cytosol to the nucleus and also plasma membrane where P11473 colocalized with caveolin-1 . P11473 ligands induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src and P11473 and their interaction . Inhibition of c-Src abrogated P11473 ligand-dependent inhibition of P22680 mRNA expression . Kinase assays showed that P11473 ligands specifically activated the c-Raf/ Q02750 /2/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) 1/2 pathway , which stimulates serine phosphorylation of P11473 and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha , and their interaction . Mammalian two-hybrid assays showed a P11473 ligand-dependent interaction of nuclear receptor corepressor-1 and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid with P11473 /retinoid X receptor-alpha ( RXRalpha ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that an P27361 /2 inhibitor reversed P11473 ligand-induced recruitment of P11473 , RXRalpha , and corepressors to human P22680 promoter . In conclusion , P11473 ligands activate membrane P11473 signaling to activate the Q02750 /2/ P27361 /2 pathway , which stimulates nuclear P11473 /RXRalpha recruitment of corepressors to inhibit P22680 gene transcription in human hepatocytes . This membrane P11473 -signaling pathway may be activated by bile acids to inhibit bile acid synthesis as a rapid response to protect hepatocytes from cholestatic liver injury .
