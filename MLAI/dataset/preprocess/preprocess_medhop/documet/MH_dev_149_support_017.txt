Transcriptional profiling of erythroid progenitors from G- P04141 mobilized and nonmobilized peripheral blood . PURPOSE : The purpose of this study was to examine the gene expression profile of granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) -mobilized peripheral blood ( mPB ) -derived progenitors , used in transplantation . METHODS : We correlated gene expression patterns of highly enriched steady-state peripheral blood ( PB ) - and mPB-derived CD71+ cells by microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses , to identify the transcriptional program during in vitro erythroid differentiation . RESULTS : The gene expression was more than doubled in mPB-derived ( 4180 genes ) compared to PB-derived erythroid progenitors ( 1667 genes ) while PB-and mPB-derived erythroid progenitors shared 1534 common genes . Comparative analysis of transcript levels showed differential expression of 54 genes between cultured erythroid progenitors of PB and mPB origin , where we identified common 13 downregulated and 30 upregulated genes . The most significant genes in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors were P07237 , DDIA3 , O15144 and P48201 . Regarding G- P04141 stimulation the Q99062 P32927 ( 1.1-fold ) was linked via P40763 to erythroid-specific P22557 ( 2.9-fold ) and P23769 ( 1.3-fold ) factors , all upregulated in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors , coupled to common upregulated Q9Y266 gene involved in the proliferation of erythroid cells . CONCLUSION : This report provides an extensive transcriptional profile of cultured erythroid progenitors and leads to a better understanding of diversity among the progenitor sources .
