Predicting the possibility of two newly isolated phenetheren ring containing compounds from Aristolochia manshuriensis as P24941 inhibitors . Aristolochia manshuriensis has been used for centuries in Chinese medicinal system for their versatile medicinal uses . Recent studies have revealed two new aristolactames ( compound A and B ) with Î³-lactame ring fused with the phenentherene ring as potent inhibitors of human Cycline Dependent Kinase2 ( P24941 ) . Studies on aristolactames and related compounds claim for their P24941 inhibition without delineating the involved mechanism and structural basis of interaction . Molecular structural model was used to we propose a structural basis of P24941 inhibition . We showed that these compounds ( A and B ) can successfully dock into the inhibitor binding pockets of human P24941 . Predicted binding affinities are comparable to known inhibitors of P24941 . Results were in agreement with the earlier biochemical studies . Hence , suggest that studied compounds A and B can be a promising scaffold for rational design of novel and potential drugs against cancer .
