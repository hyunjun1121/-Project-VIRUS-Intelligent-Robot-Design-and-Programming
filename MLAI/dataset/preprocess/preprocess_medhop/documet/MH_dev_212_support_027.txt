Functional blockade of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta but not of receptor-alpha prevents vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation in fibrous cap lesions in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice . BACKGROUND : The vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) is the central cell component involved in the fibroproliferative response in atherogenesis . As the lesion advances , VSMCs migrate from the media into the subendothelial space , thereby forming fibrous plaque lesions . Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) has been known to be a potent chemoattractant and mitogen for SMCs , but the pathophysiological role of the 2 PDGF receptors , receptor-alpha ( P16234 ) and receptor-beta ( P09619 ) in atherogenesis is poorly understood . To clarify this problem , we prepared antagonistic rat monoclonal antibodies , APA5 and APB5 , against murine P16234 and P09619 , respectively . METHODS AND RESULTS : P02649 -deficient mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 0.3 % cholesterol from 6 weeks of age and subjected to injection with 1 mg/d IP of either antibody from 12 to 18 weeks every other day . In the mice injected with APB5 , the aortic atherosclerotic lesion size and the number of intimal VSMCs were reduced by 67 % and 80 % , respectively , compared with the control mice injected with irrelevant rat IgG . In contrast , the mice that received APA5 showed only minimal reduction of lesion size , and a large number of VSMCs were observed in the intima . In the intima of advanced lesions , APB5 immunolabeled VSMCs , whereas APA5 could detect VSMCs mainly in the media . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that P09619 plays a significant role in formation of fibrous atherosclerotic lesions and that regulation of the signal transduction through P09619 could affect atherogenesis in mice .
