Dacomitinib ( PF-00299804 ) , an irreversible Pan-HER inhibitor , inhibits proliferation of P04626 -amplified breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab and lapatinib . The human P01133 ( HER ) family of receptors has been pursued as therapeutic targets in breast cancer and other malignancies . DB00072 and lapatinib are standard treatments for P04626 -amplified breast cancer , but a significant number of patients do not respond or develop resistance to these drugs . Here we evaluate the in vitro activity of dacomitinib ( PF-00299804 ) , an irreversible small molecule pan-HER inhibitor , in a large panel of human breast cancer cell lines with variable expression of the HER family receptors and ligands , and with variable sensitivity to trastuzumab and lapatinib . Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized breast epithelial lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with dacomitinib to determine IC(50) values . P04626 -amplified lines were far more likely to respond to dacomitinib than nonamplified lines ( RR , 3.39 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Furthermore , P04626 mRNA and protein expression were quantitatively associated with response . Dacomitinib reduced the phosphorylation of P04626 , P00533 , Q15303 , AKT , and P29323 in the majority of sensitive lines . Dacomitinib exerted its antiproliferative effect through a combined G(0)-G(1) arrest and an induction of apoptosis . Dacomitinib inhibited growth in several P04626 -amplified lines with de novo and acquired resistance to trastuzumab . Dacomitinib maintained a high activity in lines with acquired resistance to lapatinib . This study identifies P04626 -amplified breast cancer lines as most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of dacomitinib and provides a strong rationale for its clinical testing in P04626 -amplified breast cancers resistant to trastuzumab and lapatinib .
