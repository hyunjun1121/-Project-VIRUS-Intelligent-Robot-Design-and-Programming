Molecular targets and regulators of cardiac hypertrophy . Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the main ways in which cardiomyocytes respond to mechanical and neurohormonal stimuli . It enables myocytes to increase their work output , which improves cardiac pump function . Although cardiac hypertrophy may initially represent an adaptive response of the myocardium , ultimately , it often progresses to ventricular dilatation and heart failure which is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world . A number of signaling modulators that influence gene expression , apoptosis , cytokine release and growth factor signaling , etc. are known to regulate heart . By using genetic and cellular models of cardiac hypertrophy it has been proved that pathological hypertrophy can be prevented or reversed . This finding has promoted an enormous drive to identify novel and specific regulators of hypertrophy . In this review , we have discussed the various molecular signal transduction pathways and the regulators of hypertrophic response which includes calcineurin , cGMP , NFAT , natriuretic peptides , histone deacetylase , P05231 cytokine family , Gq/ P49842 signaling , PI3K , MAPK pathways , Na/H exchanger , DB01367 , polypeptide growth factors , P01160 , NO , P01375 , Q07869 and JAK/ P35610 pathway , microRNA , Cardiac angiogenesis and gene mutations in adult heart . Augmented knowledge of these signaling pathways and their interactions may potentially be translated into pharmacological therapies for the treatment of various cardiac diseases that are adversely affected by hypertrophy . The purpose of this review is to provide the current knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy , with special emphasis on novel researches and investigations .
