[ Use of new non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs in kidney transplantation , especially after ischemia-reperfusion injury ] . Medium- and long-term renal graft survival depends on 4 main factors : the quality of the harvested graft , ischemia-reperfusion injury during harvesting and re-implantation , rejection , and the nephrotoxicity of certain drugs ( especially immunosuppressants ) used in this setting . The most nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs are the anticalcineurins ( cyclosporine A and tacrolimus ) , a class discovered in the late 1970s and currently representing a basic component of all immunosuppressive protocols for solid organ graft recipients . The renal tubular and vascular toxicity of anticalcineurins is due to their immunosuppressive mechanism : they block the calcineurin pathway and thereby prevent transmission of the first signal from the T cell receptor to the nucleus , which normally triggers cytokine synthesis , New non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressants are therefore needed , especially for grafts of poor quality or subject to severe ischemia-reperfusion injury . Attention is turning to " old " molecules such as anti-thymocyte globulins , but exciting new immunosuppressants are now appearing . DB00092 is a fusion protein that binds to the immunological synapse-associated molecule P06729 , which normally interacts with LFA-3 . DB06681 , another fusion protein , blocks the T cell second signal CD 28- P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 . Finally , new chemical agents are being developed , such as sautrasporine , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , and tofacitinib , a Jak inhibitor .
