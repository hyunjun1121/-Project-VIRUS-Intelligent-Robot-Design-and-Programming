DB08820 : the first therapy acting on the primary cause of cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a life-shortening disorder that affects over 30,000 people in the U.S. and 70,000 worldwide . CF is caused by mutations in the P13569 gene , which codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) protein . P13569 is a chloride and bicarbonate channel and regulates several ion transporters at the epithelial cell membrane , controlling hydration or ionic composition of epithelial secretions . Management of CF is currently supportive , but recent advances in drug development have focused on therapies that assist mutant P13569 function . In the current review , we summarize the development and clinical experience with VX-770 ( ivacaftor ) , a small molecule that increases P13569 chloride conductance in vitro and in vivo , including wild-type and G551D P13569 . The G551D P13569 mutation is the third most common CF disease-causing mutation , in which the P13569 protein localizes to the epithelial cell membrane but has defective gating . With restoration of adequate P13569 function through pharmacotherapy , it is possible that the clinical course of patients with CF could be markedly improved , including longevity , quality of life and treatment burden .
