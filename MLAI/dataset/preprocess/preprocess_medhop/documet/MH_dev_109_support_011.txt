[ P08514 -IIIa inhibitors ] . Therapy involving the use of anti- P08514 -IIIa inhibitors has progressively evolved in recent years for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with acute coronary syndromes . Patients receiving anti-GP IIb-IIIa therapy have a lower risk of death or myocardial infarction than those receiving the classic anti-agregant , aspirin , alone . Two classes of products have been used in clinic , the chimeric monoclonal antibody Fab fragment , c7E3 or abciximab ( ReoPro ) , which has been the pioneer , and synthetic peptides or peptidomimetics such as eptifibatide ( Integrilin ) or tirofiban ( Agrastat ) . DB00054 is a long-acting , high-affinity receptor blocker , whereas eptifibatide and tirofiban have much shorter biological half-lives . Another property that differentiates these compounds is that the peptides bind exclusively to GP IIb-IIIa whereas c7E3 also binds to alpha v beta 3 , the vitronectin receptor . The potent inhibitory effect of these compounds increases the risk of bleeding . By carefully controlling the levels of heparin and by removing the sheath as early as possible , the hemorrhagic problems may be limited . Another potential complication is the rapid development of thrombocytopenia . The cause has yet to be found and for c7E3 no correlation with the development of HACA ( human anti-chimeric antibodies ) has been observed . Because of the chronic nature of coronary artery disease , evaluation of the readministration of c7E3 to the same patient two or even more times is under investigation . The first results do not show major problems . The best biological way to investigate the efficiency of anti- P08514 -IIIa has to be determined . Interestingly , a new point-of-care test has been proposed , while monoclonal antibodies are available that differentiate between nonoccupied and occupied P08514 -IIIa complexes .
