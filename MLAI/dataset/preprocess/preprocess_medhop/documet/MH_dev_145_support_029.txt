Effects of somatic mutations are associated with SNP in the progression of individual acute myeloid leukemia patient : the two-hit theory explains inherited predisposition to pathogenesis . This study evaluated the effects of somatic mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) on disease progression and tried to verify the two-hit theory in cancer pathogenesis . To address this issue , SNP analysis was performed using the UCSC hg19 program in 10 acute myeloid leukemia patients ( samples , P55008 to Q9Y330 ) , and somatic mutations were identified in the same tumor sample using SomaticSniper and VarScan2 . SNPs in P01116 were detected in 4 out of 10 different individuals , and those of Q9Y6K1 were detected in 5 of the same patient cohort . In 2 patients , both P01116 and Q9Y6K1 were detected simultaneously . A somatic mutation in P48735 was detected in these 2 patients . One of the patients had an additional mutation in P36888 , while the other patient had an P06748 mutation . The patient with an P36888 mutation relapsed shortly after attaining remission , while the other patient with the P06748 mutation did not suffer a relapse . Our results indicate that SNPs with additional somatic mutations affect the prognosis of AML .
