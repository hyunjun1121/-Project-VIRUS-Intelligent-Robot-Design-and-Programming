The presence and function of dopamine type 2 receptors in boar sperm : a possible role for dopamine in viability , capacitation , and modulation of sperm motility . Several studies have shown that dopamine and other catecholamines are present in oviduct luminal fluid . We recently reported that dopamine type 2 receptors ( P14416 ) are present in a wide range of mammalian sperm , suggesting a role for dopaminergic signaling in events such as fertilization , capacitation , and sperm motility . In the present study , we used Western blot analysis to show that boar sperm express P14416 and that their activation with dopamine ( 100 nM ) has a positive effect on cell viability that can be correlated with AKT/ P31749 phosphorylation . DB01200 ( 100 nM ) and dopamine ( 100 nM and 10 muM ) increased tyrosine phosphorylation during the capacitation period . Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that P14416 localization is dynamic and depends on the capacitation stage , colocalizing with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in the acrosome and midpiece region of capacitated boar sperm . This association was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation analysis . We also showed that bromocriptine ( 100 nM ) and low-concentration dopamine ( 100 nM and 10 muM ) increased total and progressive motility of sperm . However , high concentrations of dopamine ( 1 mM ) decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and motility in in vitro sperm capacitation assays . This can be explained by the presence of the dopamine transporters ( Q01959 , official symbol Q01959 ) in sperm , as demonstrated by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry . Taken together , our results support the idea that dopamine may have a fundamental role during sperm capacitation and motility in situ in the female upper reproductive tract .
