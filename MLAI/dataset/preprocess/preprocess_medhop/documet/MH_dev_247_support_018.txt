Immunohistochemical studies of the epididymal duct in Egyptian water buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ) . Using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , this study aimed to evaluate the regional distribution pattern of some biologically active proteins in the epididymis of Egyptian water buffalo and to determine the structural-functional relationships of the different epididymal structures . Wax-embedded sections from different regions of the epididymal duct from adult , clinically healthy , buffalo bulls were used . Primary antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) , S-100 , galactosyltransferase ( GalTase ) , alpha smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) , connexin 43 ( P17302 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) were used for immunohistochemical studies . The results showed that , in addition to the well-known principal and basal cells , the epididymal epithelium , similar to that of other species , possessed apical cells and intraepithelial leukocytes . IHC showed that , with the exception of P15692 which reacted negatively , all antibodies used displayed variable reactivity in the different epididymal structures . Apical cells expressed a strong reaction with P12821 along the entire length of the duct . The principal cells in the caput epididymis exhibited a distinct reactivity with S-100 and GalTase . The peritubular muscular coat displayed a marked immunostaining for α-SMA and for P17302 . In conclusion these findings showed a regional-specific distribution pattern , distinct from that in bovine bulls . Some potential functional capacities , especially absorptive and secretory ones , are discussed in relation to the different epididymal regions .
