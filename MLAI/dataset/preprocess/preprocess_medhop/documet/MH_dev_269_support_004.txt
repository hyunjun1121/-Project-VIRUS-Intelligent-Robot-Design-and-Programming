Substance P induces rapid and transient membrane blebbing in U373MG cells in a P38936 -activated kinase-dependent manner . U373MG astrocytoma cells endogenously express the full-length neurokinin 1 receptor ( P25103 ) . Substance P ( SP ) , the natural ligand for P25103 , triggers rapid and transient membrane blebbing and we report that these morphological changes have different dynamics and intracellular signaling as compared to the changes that we have previously described in HEK293- P25103 cells . In both cell lines , the SP-induced morphological changes are Gq-independent , and they require the Rho , Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase ( ROCK ) signaling pathway . Using confocal microscopy we have demonstrated that tubulin is phosphorylated subsequent to cell stimulation with SP and that tubulin accumulates inside the blebs . DB01394 , a tubulin polymerization inhibitor , blocked SP-induced blebbing in U373MG but not in HEK293- P25103 cells . Although P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) is expressed in both cell lines , SP induced rapid phosphorylation of PAK in U373MG , but failed to phosphorylate PAK in HEK293- P25103 cells . The cell-permeable Rho inhibitor P01024 transferase inhibited SP-induced PAK phosphorylation , but the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 had no effect on PAK phosphorylation , suggesting that Rho activates PAK in a ROCK-independent manner . Our study demonstrates that SP triggers rapid changes in cell morphology mediated by distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms in U373MG versus HEK293- P25103 cells .
