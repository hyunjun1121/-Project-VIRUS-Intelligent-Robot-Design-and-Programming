P42574 -Dependent Cleavage of the Glutamate- DB00151 Ligase Catalytic Subunit during Apoptotic Cell Death . Apoptotic cell death is usually accompanied by activation of a family of cysteine proteases termed caspases . Caspases mediate the selective proteolysis of multiple cellular targets often resulting in the disruption of survival pathways . Intracellular levels of the antioxidant glutathione ( DB00143 ) are an important determinant of cellular susceptibility to apoptosis . The rate-limiting step in DB00143 biosynthesis is mediated by glutamate-L-cysteine ligase ( GCL ) , a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic ( P48506 ) and a modifier ( P48507 ) subunit . In this report we demonstrate that P48506 is a direct target for caspase-mediated cleavage in multiple models of apoptotic cell death . Mutational analysis revealed that caspase-mediated cleavage of P48506 occurs at DB00128 (499) within the sequence AVVD(499)G . P48506 cleavage occurs upstream of DB00151 (553) , which is thought to be important for association with P48507 . P48506 cleavage is accompanied by a rapid loss of intracellular DB00143 due to caspase-mediated extrusion of DB00143 from the cell . However , while P48506 cleavage is dependent on caspase-3 , DB00143 extrusion occurs by a caspase-3-independent mechanism . Our identification of P48506 as a target for caspase-3-dependent cleavage during apoptotic cell death suggests that this post-translational modification may represent a novel mechanism for regulating DB00143 biosynthesis during apoptosis .
