Acute exacerbation of preexisting interstitial lung disease after administration of etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis . A 70-year-old woman with a 6-year history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and asymptomatic interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) began taking etanercept for ongoing arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate ( MTX ) and bucillamine . MTX was discontinued before introduction of etanercept . She developed lung injury 8 weeks after starting etanercept . DB00005 was discontinued and oral prednisolone 40 mg/day was begun , and her clinical findings gradually improved . Lung injury , although rare , is a recently noticed , potentially fatal adverse effect of all 3 licensed biological anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) agents . We recommend caution in the use of anti- P01375 agents in elderly RA patients with preexisting ILD .
