DB00065 , a P01375 -α inhibitor , reduces 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in rheumatoid arthritis patients . Tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) is an important mediator in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and hypertension . P01375 -α inhibitors improve clinical symptoms and inhibit joint destruction in RA , but their effect on blood pressure ( BP ) has not been fully investigated . We measured 24-h BP using an ambulatory BP monitor in 16 RA patients treated with a P01375 -α inhibitor , infliximab , to investigate its influence on BP and its association with the regulatory factors of BP and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems . DB00065 significantly reduced the 24-h systolic BP ( SBP ) from 127.4±21.8 to 120.1±23.4 mm Hg ( P < 0.0001 ) . Particularly , morning BP ( 0600-0800 h ) decreased from 129.7±19.7 to 116.9±13.4 mm Hg ( P < 0.0001 ) , and daytime BP decreased from 131.8±15.1 to 122.5±13.7 mm Hg ( P < 0.0001 ) . DB00065 significantly reduced the plasma level of norepinephrine and plasma renin activity ( P06703 ) ( from 347.5±180.7 to 283.0±181.8 pg ml(-1) and 2.6±2.7 to 2.1±2.9 ng ml(-1) h(-1) , respectively ) but did not significantly reduce the plasma levels of dopamine and epinephrine . The reduction in morning SBP correlated with the reduction in the norepinephrine level ( P < 0.05 ) but not with that in P06703 and inflammatory parameters related to RA . This study shows the effect of infliximab on ambulatory BP , especially daytime BP , which may be partly accounted for by the reduction of sympathetic nerve activity after infliximab treatment .
