Complementary and alternative medicine use and quality of life in patients with primary brain tumors . This study explored the use of complementary and alternative medicine ( P62158 ) approaches and their relationship with demographic and disease characteristics and quality of life ( QOL ) in the primary brain tumor ( P10721 ) population . One hundred one P10721 patients were enrolled in this study . The results showed that 34 % of patients reported using P62158 . Forty-one percent reported using more than one type of P62158 . The average cost of each P62158 used per month was 69 dollars , with 20 % of patients spending more than 100 dollars per month . The majority ( 74 % ) reported that their physicians were unaware of their use of P62158 . Data analysis found a higher performance status to be the only factor significantly related to use of P62158 therapy ( P < 0.005 ) . There was no difference in patient report of QOL between users and nonusers of P62158 therapies . The high number of patients who do not report P62158 use has potential implications for evaluation of symptoms and response to therapy in this population . This may be especially relevant in those patients with higher functional status participating in clinical trials .
