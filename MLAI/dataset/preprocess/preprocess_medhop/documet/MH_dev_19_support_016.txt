Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of ferric uptake regulator from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria have been widely used in studies of magnetic domains and in commercial applications . The iron content of magnetotactic bacteria is ∼100 times higher than that of Escherichia coli . Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 can still take up iron even at high intracellular concentrations . Ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) is a global iron-responsive regulator that affects magnetosome formation , iron transport and oxygen metabolism . However , the mechanism of iron uptake and homeostasis by M. gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 Fur is not clear . Here , the expression , purification and crystallization of apo and SeMet Fur from M. gryphiswaldense Q9UBK8 -1 are reported . The crystals belonged to space group P06681 . Matthews coefficient analysis and size-exclusion chromatography showed that the asymmetric unit probably contains one dimer of Fur . Diffraction data were optimized to 1.58 Å resolution for apo Fur and to 1.9 Å resolution for SeMet Fur .
