Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived dendritic cells express tumor associated antigens : Q8TCS8 , O75439 , O75330 , P35613 and P07992 . In all types of leukemia both in children and adults there is a need for novel therapies that could reduce the risk of relapse after standard treatment . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cells are ineffective antigen presenting cells , but as shown by many authors including results from our laboratory , stimulation with P29965 restores their antigen expressing capacity . The development of T-cell therapies for leukemic patients can be based on discovery of leukemia-associated antigens ( LAA ) which could be recognized by the host immune system . The aim of our present study was to test the hypothesis that leukemia-derived dendritic cells maintain the expression of tumor associated antigens . Twenty five children with B-cell precursor ALL were prospectively enrolled into the study . The mononuclear cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were cultured and stimulated ( or not ) with P29965 and P05112 . The assessment of costimulatory/adhesion molecules with the use of flow cytometry and real-time RT PCR were used to confirm the possibility of turning ALL cells into dendritic-like cells . Additionally 22 tumor associated antigens mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR technique with the TaqMan chemistry using ready-to-use Low Density Arrays for Gene Expression . The results of the study showed maintained expression and even up-regulation of some ( Q8TCS8 , O75439 , O75330 / O75330 , P35613 and P07992 ) tumor associated antigens in P25942 -activated leukemic cells . P29965 stimulation leading to the differentiation of leukemic cells into DCs which combine both antigen presenting function and expression of tumor associated antigens represents an interesting approach in cancer immunotherapy .
