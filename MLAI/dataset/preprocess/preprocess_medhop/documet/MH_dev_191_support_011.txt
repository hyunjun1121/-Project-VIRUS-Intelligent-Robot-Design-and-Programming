P42345 mediates RhoA-dependent leptin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . Obesity is associated with increased leptin production which may contribute to cardiac hypertrophy . However , the mechanism of leptin-induced cardiac hypertrophy remains incompletely understood . The Rho family ( RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 ) and mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) have recently emerged as important regulators of cell growth . We therefore explored the roles and interrelationships of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , P42345 , and the Rho family in the regulation of actin polymerization and leptin-induced hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes . Five minutes treatment with leptin ( 3.1 nM ) resulted in activation of RhoA and Rac1 ( by 330 and 160 % , respectively , P < 0.05 ) which was significantly attenuated by AG-490 ( 50 μM ) and LY294002 ( 10 μM ) , specific inhibitors of O60674 and PI3K , respectively . However , Cdc42 activity was unaffected by leptin . The hypertrophic effect of leptin was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of P08133 (S6K) , the major target of P42345 , by 110 % ( P < 0.05 ) . The specific P42345 inhibitor rapamycin ( 10 nM ) attenuated leptin-induced RhoA and Rac1 activation . Furthermore , the leptin-induced decrease in the G/F-actin ratio , a measure of actin polymerization , was blunted by rapamycin . Leptin produced activation of the transcriptional factor P43694 which was attenuated by the RhoA inhibitor P01024 , the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 ( 10 μM ) as well as rapamycin . Our results demonstrate a critical role for PI3K/ P42345 / P08133 (S6K) in leptin-induced RhoA activation resulting in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with P43694 stimulation .
