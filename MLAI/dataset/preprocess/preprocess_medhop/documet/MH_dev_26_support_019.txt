Current and future pharmacologic options for the management of patients unable to achieve low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals with statins . Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) lowering is the mainstay of the current treatment guidelines in the management of cardiovascular risk . P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) are currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs . However , a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins . Therefore , an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels , either by monotherapy or combination therapy . Upregulation of the P01130 with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat ( DB05317 ) has recently been discontinued . DB00973 combined with statins allowed significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C targets . Other inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption such as disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate ( DB05449 ) and bile acid transport inhibitors have shown positive results in early development trials , whereas the prospect of acyl coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition in cardiovascular prevention is dire . Selective inhibition of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) by antisense oligonucleotides is a new approach to modify cholesterol levels . The inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA is in advanced development and mipomersen sodium ( ISIS 301012 ) has shown striking results in phase II studies both as monotherapy as well as in combination with statins .
