Regulated catalysis of extracellular nucleotides by vascular P49961 / P49961 is required for liver regeneration . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Little is known about how endothelial cells respond to injury , regulate hepatocyte turnover and reconstitute the hepatic vasculature . We aimed to determine the effects of the vascular ectonucleotidase P49961 on sinusoidal endothelial cell responses following partial hepatectomy and to dissect purinergic and growth factor interactions in this model . METHODS : Parameters of liver injury and regeneration , as well as the kinetics of hepatocellular and sinusoidal endothelial cell proliferation , were assessed following partial hepatectomy in mice that do not express P49961 , that do not express DB00171 /UTP receptor P41231 , and in controls . The effects of extracellular DB00171 on vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) , and interleukin-6 responses were determined in vivo and in vitro . Phosphorylation of the endothelial P15692 receptor in response to extracellular nucleotides and growth factors was assessed in vitro . RESULTS : After partial hepatectomy , expression of the vascular ectonucleotidase P49961 increased on sinusoidal endothelial cells . Targeted disruption of P49961 impaired hepatocellular regeneration , reduced angiogenesis , and increased hepatic injury , resulting in pronounced vascular endothelial apoptosis , and decreased survival . Decreased P14210 release by sinusoidal endothelial cells , despite high levels of P15692 , reduced paracrine stimulation of hepatocytes . Failure of P15692 receptor-2/ P35968 transactivation by extracellular nucleotides on P49961 -null endothelial cells was associated with P41231 receptor desensitization . CONCLUSIONS : Regulated phosphohydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides by P49961 coordinates both hepatocyte and endothelial cell proliferation following partial hepatectomy . Lack of P49961 activity is associated with decreased hepatic regeneration and failure of vascular reconstitution .
