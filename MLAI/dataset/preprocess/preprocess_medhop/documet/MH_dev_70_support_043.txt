P00374 protects endothelial nitric oxide synthase from uncoupling in tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency . DB00360 ( BH4 ) is a required cofactor for the synthesis of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) , and endothelial BH4 bioavailability is a critical factor in regulating the balance between NO and superoxide production ( P29474 coupling ) . Biosynthesis of BH4 is determined by the activity of GTP-cyclohydrolase I ( GTPCH ) . However , BH4 levels may also be influenced by oxidation , forming 7,8-dihydrobiopterin ( BH2 ) , which promotes P29474 uncoupling . Conversely , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) can regenerate BH4 from BH2 , but whether P00374 is functionally important in maintaining P29474 coupling remains unclear . To investigate the mechanism by which P00374 might regulate P29474 coupling in vivo , we treated wild-type , BH4-deficient ( hph-1 ) , and GTPCH-overexpressing ( P30793 -Tg ) mice with methotrexate ( MTX ) , to inhibit BH4 recycling by P00374 . MTX treatment resulted in a striking elevation in BH2 and a decreased BH4:BH2 ratio in the aortas of wild-type mice . These effects were magnified in hph-1 but diminished in P30793 -Tg mice . Attenuated P29474 activity was observed in MTX-treated hph-1 but not wild-type or P30793 -Tg mouse lung , suggesting that inhibition of P00374 in BH4-deficient states leads to P29474 uncoupling . Taken together , these data reveal a key role for P00374 in regulating the BH4 vs BH2 ratio and P29474 coupling under conditions of low total biopterin availability in vivo .
