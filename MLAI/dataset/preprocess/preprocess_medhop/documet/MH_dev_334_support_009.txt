A Type II Arabinogalactan from Anoectochilus formosanus for G- P04141 Production in Macrophages and Leukopenia Improvement in Q86TM3 -Bearing Mice Treated with DB00544 . Anoectochilus formosanus is an herb well known in Asian countries . The polysaccharide isolated from A. formosanus consists of type II arabinogalactan ( AGAF ) , with branched 3,6-Gal as the major moiety . In this study , AGAF was examined for the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) production and related protein expression in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages . The signaling pathway of G- P04141 production involves AGAF and mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) inhibitors and pattern-recognition receptor antibodies . AGAF was evaluated to ease the leukopenia in Q86TM3 -colon-cancer-bearing mice treated with 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) . The results of this study showed that AGAF was a stimulant for O60603 and Q9BXN2 and that it induced G- P04141 production , through p38 and P29323 MAPK , and NF- Îº B pathways . In vivo examination showed that the oral administration of AGAF mitigated the side effects of leukopenia caused by DB00544 in colon-cancer-bearing mice . In conclusion , the botanic type II AGAF in this study was a potent G- P04141 inducer in vivo and in vitro .
