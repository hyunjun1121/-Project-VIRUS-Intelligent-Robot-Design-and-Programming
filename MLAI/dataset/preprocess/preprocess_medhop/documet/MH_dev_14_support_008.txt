Distinct functional properties of native somatostatin receptor subtype 5 compared with subtype 2 in the regulation of DB01285 release by corticotroph tumor cells . In a series of human corticotroph adenomas , we recently found predominant mRNA expression of somatostatin ( SS ) receptor subtype 5 ( sst5 ) . After 72 h , the multiligand SS analog DB06663 , which has a very high sst5 binding affinity , but not DB00104 ( O75051 ) , significantly inhibited basal DB01285 release . To further explore the role of sst5 in the regulation of DB01285 release , we conducted additional studies with mouse AtT-20 cells . DB06663 showed a 7-fold higher ligand binding affinity and a 19-fold higher potency in stimulating guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in AtT-20 cell membranes compared with O75051 . DB06663 potently suppressed P06850 -induced DB01285 release , which was not affected by 48-h dexamethasone ( DEX ) pretreatment . However , DEX attenuated the inhibitory effects of O75051 on DB01285 release , whereas it increased the inhibitory potency of O43521 -23268 , an sst5-specific analog , on DB01285 release . Quantitative PCR analysis showed that DEX lowered sst(2A+2B) mRNA expression significantly after 24 and 48 h , whereas sst5 mRNA levels were not significantly affected by DEX treatment . Moreover , Scatchard analyses showed that DEX suppressed maximum binding capacity ( B(max) ) by 72 % when 125I-Tyr3-labeled O75051 was used as radioligand , whereas B(max) declined only by 17 % when AtT-20 cells were treated with [125I-Tyr11]SS-14 . These data suggest that the sst5 protein , compared with sst2 , is more resistant to glucocorticoids . Finally , after SS analog preincubation , compared with O75051 both DB06663 and O43521 -23268 showed a significantly higher inhibitory effect on P06850 -induced DB01285 release . In conclusion , our data support the concept that the sst5 receptor might be a target for new therapeutic agents to treat Cushing 's disease .
