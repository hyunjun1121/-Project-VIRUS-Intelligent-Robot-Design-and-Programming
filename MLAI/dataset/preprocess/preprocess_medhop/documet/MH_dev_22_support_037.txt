Systemic treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer : a systematic review . AIM : We aimed to systematically review and summarize data from the available clinical trials that examined the treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . METHODS : We reviewed phase 2 and 3 studies in which an anti- P04626 agent was used in one or both arms of the study . While formal meta-analysis was not possible for such a heterogeneous group of trials , resulting forest plots outline some generalizable findings . RESULTS : There is strong evidence that the addition of an anti- P04626 agent to standard chemo- or endocrine therapy improves clinically relevant measurable outcomes . There is also consistent evidence that initial treatment with trastuzumab alone ( and subsequent use of a cytotoxic ) is inferior to the initial combination of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy , and that either DB05773 or dual anti- P04626 agents are superior to single anti- P04626 agent regimens . There is no strong evidence that the use of more than one cytotoxic agent together with an anti- P04626 agent confers any benefit over a single cytotoxic , anti- P04626 combination . CONCLUSION : This review provides a strong evidence base for current clinical practice with a discussion of treatment in the Australian setting .
