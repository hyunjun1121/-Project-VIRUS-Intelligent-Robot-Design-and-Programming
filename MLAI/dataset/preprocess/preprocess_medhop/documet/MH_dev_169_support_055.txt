P40189 -linked signal transduction promotes the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells . In order to explore the role of P40189 -linked signal transduction in the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells ( DC ) , the mAb , B- P28222 , an agonist of P40189 , was used for the activation of P40189 on DC . The effects of cytokines and of anti- P40189 mAb on the proliferation of DC , and their expression of IL-12 and P33681 ( P33681 -1 ) by DC were evaluated . DC differentiating from peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not express the P05231 receptor alpha chain , but expressed P40189 . Anti- P40189 mAb promoted the proliferation of DC , induced by P05112 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) , by up-regulating the GM- P04141 receptor on DC . DC induced by P40189 mAb and cytokines expressed DC-derived CC chemokine , as measured by RT-PCR . Induced DC also stimulated strong proliferation of autologous T cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction since an up-regulated expression of IL-12 and P33681 ( P33681 -1 ) was observed in DC activated by anti- P40189 mAb . Thus , P40189 signal transduction is important for the differentiation and maturation of DC .
