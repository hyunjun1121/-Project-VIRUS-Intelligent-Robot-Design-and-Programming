DB11320 , carbachol , and serotonin induce hyperresponsiveness to DB00171 in guinea pig tracheas : involvement of P35354 pathway . Extracellular DB00171 promotes an indirect contraction of airway smooth muscle via the secondary release of thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) from airway epithelium . Our aim was to evaluate if common contractile agonists modify this response to DB00171 . Tracheas from sensitized guinea pigs were used to evaluate DB00171 -induced contractions before and after a transient contraction produced by histamine , carbachol , or serotonin . Epithelial mRNA for P23219 and P35354 was measured by RT-PCR and their expression assessed by immunohistochemistry . Compared with the initial response , DB00171 -induced contraction was potentiated by pretreatment with histamine , carbachol , or serotonin . Either suramin ( antagonist of P2X and P2Y receptors ) plus Q08999 ( antagonist of P2Y receptors ) or indomethacin ( inhibitor of P23219 and P35354 ) annulled the DB00171 -induced contraction , suggesting that it was mediated by P2Y receptor stimulation and TXA2 production . When P35354 was inhibited by SC-58125 or thromboxane receptors were antagonized by SQ-29548 , just the potentiation was abolished , leaving the basal response intact . Airway epithelial cells showed increased P35354 mRNA after stimulation with histamine or carbachol , but not serotonin , while P23219 mRNA was unaffected . Immunochemistry corroborated this upregulation of P35354 . In conclusion , we showed for the first time that histamine and carbachol cause hyperresponsiveness to DB00171 by upregulating P35354 in airway epithelium , which likely increases TXA2 production . Serotonin-mediated hyperresponsiveness seems to be independent of P35354 upregulation , but nonetheless is TXA2 dependent . Because acetylcholine , histamine , and serotonin can be present during asthmatic exacerbations , their potential interactions with DB00171 might be relevant in its pathophysiology .
