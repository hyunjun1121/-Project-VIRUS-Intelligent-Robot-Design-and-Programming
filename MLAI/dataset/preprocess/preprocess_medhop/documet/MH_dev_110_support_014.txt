Observation of an unusual electronically distorted semiquinone radical of P11498 metabolites in the active site of prostaglandin H synthase-2 . The activation of the metabolites of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) into highly reactive radicals is of fundamental importance . We found that human recombinant prostaglandin H synthase-2 ( hPGHS-2 ) biotransforms dihydroxy-PCBs , such as 4-chlorobiphenyl-2',5'-hydroquinone ( 4- P34972 ',5'-H(2)Q ) , into semiquinone radicals via one-electron oxidation . Using electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy , we observed the formation of the symmetric quartet spectrum ( 1:3:3:1 by area ) of 4-chlorobiphenyl-2',5'-semiquinone radical ( 4- P34972 ',5'-SQ()(-) ) from 4- P34972 ',5'-H(2)Q . This spectrum changed to an asymmetric spectrum with time : the change can be explained as the overlap of two different semiquinone radical species . Hindered rotation of the 4- P34972 ',5'-SQ()(-) appears not to be a major factor for the change in lineshape because increasing the viscosity of the medium with glycerol produced no significant change in lineshape . Introduction of a fluorine , which increases the steric hindrance for rotation of the dihydroxy- P11498 studied , also produced no significant changes . An in silico molecular docking model of 4- P34972 ',5'-H(2)Q in the peroxidase site of hPGHS-2 together with ab initio quantum mechanical studies indicate that the close proximity of a negatively charged carboxylic acid in the peroxidase active site may be responsible for the observed perturbation in the spectrum . This study provides new insights into the formation of semiquinones from P11498 metabolites and underscores the potential role of P35354 in the metabolic activation of PCBs .
