P62937 facilitates translocation of the Clostridium botulinum P06681 toxin across membranes of acidified endosomes into the cytosol of mammalian cells . The binary Clostridium botulinum P06681 toxin consists of the binding/translocation component C2IIa and the separate enzyme component C2I , which mono-ADP-ribosylates actin in eukaryotic cells . Pore formation of C2IIa in early endosomal membranes facilitates translocation of unfolded C2I into the cytosol . We discovered earlier that translocation of C2I depends on the activity of the host cell chaperone heat shock protein Hsp90 . Here , we demonstrate that cyclosporin A , which inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins , inhibited intoxication of cells with P06681 toxin and prevented uptake of C2I into the cytosol . DB00091 blocked the pH-dependent translocation of C2I activity across membranes of intact cells and of partially purified early endosomes . In vitro , the addition of cytosol to P06681 toxin-loaded endosomes induced translocation of C2I activity into the cytosol , which was prevented by pretreatment of the cytosol with an antibody against cyclophilin A . Pull-down experiments with lysates from P06681 toxin-treated cells revealed specific binding of cyclophilin A to the N-terminal domain of C2I . In conclusion , our results suggest an essential role of cyclophilin A for translocation of C2I across endosomal membranes during the uptake of P06681 toxin into mammalian cells .
