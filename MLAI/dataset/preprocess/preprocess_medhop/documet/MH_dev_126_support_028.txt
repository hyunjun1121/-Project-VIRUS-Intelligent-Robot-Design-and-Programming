Increased expression of cellular retinol-binding protein 1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma . PURPOSE : To investigate the genomic alterations in larynx carcinomas ( LaCa ) tissues and its prognostics values in predicting survival . METHODS : To analyse the aberrations in the genome of LaCa patients , we used array comparative genomic hybridization in 19 human laryngeal tumour samples . DNA samples were also subjected to detect human papillomavirus ( HPV ) sequences by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Copy number gain was confirmed by real-time PCR . The cellular retinol-binding protein 1 ( P09455 -1 ) gene expression was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry assay on LaCa tissues . To identify prognostic feature , P09455 -1 gene gain was correlated to patient survival . RESULTS : The most common gains were detected for P09455 -1 and P00533 genes , while DNA lost in RAF-1 gene . Immunohistochemistry assay was revealed strong expression of P09455 protein in those cases with P09455 -1 gene gain . The P09455 -1 gene gain and its expression correlated significantly with survival ( P = 0.003 ) . Cox regression analysis indicated that P09455 -1 expression level was a factor of survival ( P = 0.008 ) . HPV sequences were detected in 42 % of the samples , and did not show any relationship with specific gene alterations . CONCLUSION : Our data shows that P09455 -1 gene gain can be determined by immunohistochemistry on routinely processed tissue specimens , and could support as a potential novel marker for long-term survival in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma .
