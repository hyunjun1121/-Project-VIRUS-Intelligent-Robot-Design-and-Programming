Q9NQT5 , the N-terminal domain of p35 , protects against Q00535 /p25-induced neurotoxicity . P12004 -dependent kinase 5( Q00535 ) in complex with its activator , p35 ( protein of 35 kDa ) , is essential for early neurodevelopment in mammals . However , endogenous cleavage of p35 to p25 is associated with neuron death and neurodegenerative disease . Here we show that a peptide ( Q9NQT5 ' ) encoding the N-terminal domain of p35 protects against Q00535 /p25-induced toxicity in neurons . Q9NQT5 ' also prevented the death of neurons treated with the neurotoxin , 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( P25189 (+) ) , which induces conversion of endogenous p35 to p25 , and Parkinson disease ( PD ) -like symptoms in animals . P25189 (+) induces Q00535 /p25-dependent phosphorylation of peroxiredoxin 2 ( Prx2 ) , resulting in inhibition of its peroxireductase activity and accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . We found that Q9NQT5 ' expression inhibited both Prx2 phosphorylation and ROS accumulation in neurons . In addition , Q9NQT5 ' inhibited the p25-induced appearance of antigen of the Ki67 antibody ( Ki67 ) and phosphohistone P16104 ( Î³ P16104 ) , classic markers of cell cycle activity and DNA double-strand breakage , respectively , associated with neuron death . Our results suggest that Q9NQT5 ( protein of 10 kDa ) is a unique prosurvival domain in p35 , essential for normal Q00535 /p35 function in neurons . Loss of the Q9NQT5 domain results in Q00535 /p25 toxicity and neurodegeneration in vivo .
