REV-ERBα inhibits the P35354 expression in bovine uterus endometrium stromal and epithelial cells exposed to ovarian steroids . The nuclear receptor REV-ERBα ( encoded by P20393 ) has a critical role in metabolism and physiology as well as circadian rhythm . Here , we investigated the possible contribution of clock genes including P20393 to the secretion of prostaglandin F2α ( PGF2α ) from bovine uterine stromal ( USCs ) and epithelial cells ( UECs ) by modulating the expression of P35354 . The circadian oscillation of clock genes in the cells was weak compared with that reported in rodents , but the expression of O00327 , O15534 , and P20393 was changed temporally by treatment with ovarian steroids . Significant expression of clock genes including P20393 was detected in USCs exposed to progesterone . P20393 was also significantly expressed in UECs exposed to estradiol . The expression of P35354 was suppressed in USCs exposed to progesterone , while the expression was initially suppressed in UECs exposed to estradiol and then increased after long-term exposure to estradiol . O00327 knockdown with specific siRNA caused a significant decrease in the transcript levels of P20393 and P35354 in USCs , but not in UECs . The production of PGF2α also decreased in USCs after O00327 knockdown , while its level did not significantly change in UECs . The transcript level of P35354 was increased by treatment with the antagonist of REV-ERBα in both cell types , but the agonist was ineffective . In these two cell types treated with the agonist or antagonist , the PGF2α production coincided well with the P35354 expression . Collectively , these results indicate that REV-ERBα plays an inhibitory role in the expression of P35354 in both bovine USCs and UECs treated with ovarian steroids .
