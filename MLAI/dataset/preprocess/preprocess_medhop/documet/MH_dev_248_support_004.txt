MicroRNA-148a is silenced by hypermethylation and interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1 in gastric cancer . Studies have shown that microRNA-148a ( miR-148a ) was proved to be silenced while DNA methyltransferase 1 ( P26358 ) was over-expressed in gastric cancer . But the mechanism of aberrant expression of miR-148a and P26358 and their relationships in gastric cancer are still unknown . The aims of this study were to investigate the expression profile of miR-148a and P26358 and reveal whether they have any relationships . We used reverse-transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR , methylation-specific PCR and Western blot to measure the level of miR-148a expression , DNA methylation level and P26358 expression , respectively . Gastric cancer cells were transfected with plasmid or siRNA or treated with DB01262 . Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by cell counting and flow cytometric analysis . In this study , we demonstrated that gastric cancer tissues and cell lines displayed a consistent down-regulation of miR-148a and hypermethylation of promoter region . P26358 was over-expressed in primary tumors and cell lines , while knockdown of P26358 using siRNA could decrease methylation level of miR-148a promoter and restore its expression . Furthermore , ectopic over-expression of miR-148a in cancer cell lines caused reduction in P26358 expression and inhibited cell proliferation , but no obvious change was found in apoptosis rate . These results suggest that miR-148a is inactivated by DNA hypermethylation of promoter region in gastric cancer , which is mediated through P26358 over-expression . Additionally , the silence of miR-148a reduces its suppression to P26358 in gastric cancer , and this may in turn result in over-expression of P26358 and promote DNA hypermethylation .
