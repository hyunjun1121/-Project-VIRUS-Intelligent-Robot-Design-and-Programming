The effects of trastuzumab on the P01730 +CD25+FoxP3+ and P01730 + Q16552 + T-cell axis in patients with breast cancer . In addition to the direct targeting effects on P04626 -positive cells , trastuzumab may have a therapeutic role modulating the activity of the cellular immune system in patients with breast cancer . To investigate this further , the balance of T-regulatory ( T(reg) ) , Th17 , natural killer ( NK ) and NK T ( NKT ) cells before , during and after trastuzumab therapy was investigated . Sequential frequencies of circulating T(reg) cells , Th17 cells , NK and NKT cells were measured in peripheral blood of breast cancer patients and normal controls throughout therapy . Individuals with breast cancer had significantly higher T(reg) frequencies of peripheral blood compared with healthy controls ( 9.2 or 8.6 vs 6 % ; P < 0.05 ) , and no significant differences in T(reg) frequencies were observed between P04626 -positive and P04626 -negative individuals . The number of Th17 cells was lowest in P04626 -positive patients compared with both healthy controls and P04626 -negative patients ( 0.31 vs 0.75 % or 0.84 % ; P=0.01 ) . There appeared to be an inverse relationship between T(reg) and Th17 frequencies in metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) with T(reg) levels significantly reduced during treatment with trastuzumab ( P=0.04 ) , whereas Th17 frequencies were concomitantly increased ( P=0.04 ) . This study supports earlier data that T(reg) cells are present at higher frequencies in breast cancer patients compared with healthy individuals . For the first time , we show that P04626 -positive individuals with breast carcinomas have reduced numbers of circulating Th17 cells , which appear , in turn to have an inverse relationship with T(reg) frequency in MBC . The change in balance of the T(reg) : Th17 ratio appears to characterise the cancer state , and furthermore , is disrupted by trastuzumab therapy .
