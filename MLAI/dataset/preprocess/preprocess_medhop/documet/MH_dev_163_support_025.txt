Rosiglitazone influences the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and P08571 receptor in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients . Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased inflammatory response , which may contribute to atherosclerosis progression . Experimental results demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity of glitazones ; their effect on leukocyte adhesion molecules has not been studied to date . We therefore studied the effect of rosiglitazone treatment on leukocyte surface expression of adhesion molecules in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and compared our results with findings in healthy subjects . 33 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 32 healthy controls were included ; patients were examined at baseline and after 5 months of rosiglitazone treatment ( 4 mg/d ) . Leukocyte expression of adhesion molecules LFA-1 , P05107 and P05362 was quantified using flow cytometry ; in addition , P08571 ( lipopolysaccharide receptor ) expression was analyzed as a marker of nonspecific immunity . The expression of examined molecules at baseline was higher in patients compared to controls . Despite only mild decrease in blood glucose , rosiglitazone treatment induced substantial decrease of P05107 and P08571 expression and borderline decrease of LFA-1 and P05362 expression ( on monocytes only ) . We thus observed improvement in the expression of leukocyte inflammatory markers after rosiglitazone treatment . This effect is supposed to be mediated by direct effect of rosiglitazone on P37231 receptors on leukocytes .
