GABA Receptors Genes Polymorphisms and DB00898 Dependence : No Evidence of an Association in an Italian Male Population . OBJECTIVE : The genes encoding for gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) A and B receptors may be considered as candidates for alcoholism ; genetic alterations at this level may produce structural and functional diversity and thus play a role in the response to alcohol addiction treatment . To investigate these aspects further , we conducted a preliminary genetic association study on a population of Italian male alcohol addicts , focusing on GABA A and B receptors . METHODS : A total of 186 alcohol-dependent subjects ( in the first phase 139 , then 47 more samples ) and 182 controls were genotyped for 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of genes encoding the alpha-1 subunit of GABA A receptor ( P14867 ) and subunits 1 and 2 of GABA B receptor ( Q9UBS5 and O75899 ) . The chi-squared test for allele and genotype distributions and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis of both subjects and controls were performed . Bonferroni 's correction for multiple comparisons was applied . RESULTS : Preliminary results comparing 139 alcohol-dependent subjects and 182 controls showed differences in genotype distribution in the former for SNP rs29253 , located in the intron region of the Q9UBS5 gene . In order to clarify the meaning of this association , 47 more samples from alcohol-dependent subjects were tested for this SNP only : the previously found association was not confirmed . CONCLUSION : The lack of significant differences between the two groups does not provide evidence that GABRA 1 and Q9UBS5 and 2 genes are candidates for alcoholism in this population . Further studies with larger samples are needed , together with investigation of other components of the GABA pathway .
