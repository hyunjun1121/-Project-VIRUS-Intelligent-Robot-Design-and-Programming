Ceramide stabilizes beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 and promotes amyloid beta-peptide biogenesis . The lipid second messenger ceramide regulates several biochemical events that occur during aging . In addition , its level is highly elevated in the amyloid-burdened brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients . Here , we analyzed the impact of aberrant ceramide levels on amyloid beta-peptide ( Abeta ) generation by using a cell-permeable analog of ceramide , P13671 -ceramide , and several biochemical inhibitors of the sphingomyelin/glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway . We found that P13671 -ceramide increased the biogenesis of Abeta by affecting beta-but not gamma-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein . Similarly to P13671 -ceramide , increased levels of endogenous ceramide induced by neutral sphingomyelinase treatment also promoted the biogenesis of Abeta . Conversely , fumonisin B1 , which inhibits the biosynthesis of endogenous ceramide , reduced Abeta production . Exogenous P13671 -ceramide restored both intracellular ceramide levels and Abeta generation in fumonisin B1-treated cells . These events were specific for amyloid precursor protein and were not associated with apoptotic cell death . Pulse-chase and time-course degradation experiments showed that ceramide post-translationally stabilizes the beta-secretase P56817 . Taken together , these data indicate that the lipid second messenger ceramide , which is elevated in the brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients , increases the half-life of P56817 and thereby promotes Abeta biogenesis .
