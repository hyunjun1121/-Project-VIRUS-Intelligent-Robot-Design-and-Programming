[ Anti- P01375 treatment and spondyloarthropathies ] . Spondyloarthropathies are characterized by both axial and peripheral joint involvement , by the association with " other diseases " mainly Psoriasis , Crohn 's and Anterior Uveitis and by the high prevalence of HLA B-27 . While disease modifying drugs , such as DB00563 or Sulfasalazine , are only partially effective in controlling peripheral arthritis , the treatment of the axial part remained only symptomatic . The recently introduced anti- P01375 drugs DB00065 ( Remicade ) and DB00005 ( Enbrel ) for the treatment of Crohn 's disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis has been expended to Spondyloarthropathies with highly promising results . The rationale and the early beneficial results of this new approach in spondyloarthropathies are reviewed .
