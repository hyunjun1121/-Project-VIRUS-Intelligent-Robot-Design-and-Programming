[ CT analysis of developmental spinal canal stenosis ] . The cervical and the lumbar vertebrae were analyzed by computed tomography in two groups . One group consisted of the patients with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine ( the smallest AP diameter of the cervical spinal canal in the lateral view of X-ray was less than 12 mm ) and the other was the control group ( the smallest diameter was more than 14 mm ) . The canal to body ratio of the cross-sectional area ( P16152 ) , the modified Jones ' " canal to body ratio " ( JNS ) and the flat index of the vertebral canal ( FI ) were measured at C4, P01031 , P13671 , Q9NP50 and Q15004 . The shape of the vertebral canal of Q9NP50 and Q15004 was classified according to Baddeley . In the stenosis group , P16152 and JNS were smaller at every measured level and FI was smaller at C4 , P01031 and P13671 compared with the control group , Trefoil canals were found more frequently in the stenosis group . There was a clear relationship between the developmental stenosis of the cervical and the lumbar spinal canal . On treating patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy , one should consider the possibility of pan-spinal canal stenosis .
