DB08916 demonstrates remarkable activity against P04626 -amplified uterine serous endometrial cancer in vitro and in vivo . BACKGROUND : Uterine serous carcinomas ( USCs ) are an aggressive form of uterine cancer that may rely on P04626 /neu amplification as a driver of proliferation . The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of USC cell lines with and without P04626 /neu gene amplification to afatinib , an irreversible ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor , and to test the efficacy of afatinib in the treatment of P04626 -amplified USC xenografts . METHODS : Eight of fifteen primary USC cell lines ( four with P04626 amplification and four without ) demonstrating similar in vitro growth rates were treated with scalar concentrations of afatinib . Effects on cell growth , signalling and cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry assays . Mice harbouring xenografts of P04626 /neu-amplified USC were treated with afatinib by gavage to determine the effect on tumour growth and overall survival . RESULTS : Primary chemotherapy-resistant USC cell lines harbouring P04626 /neu gene amplification were exquisitely sensitive to afatinib exposure ( mean ± s.e.m. IC50=0.0056 ± 0.0006 μM ) and significantly more sensitive than P04626 /neu-non-amplified USC cell lines ( mean ± s.e.m. IC50=0.563 ± 0.092 μM , P < 0.0001 ) . DB08916 exposure resulted in abrogation of cell survival , inhibition of P04626 /neu autophosphorylation and S6 transcription factor phosphorylation in P04626 /neu overexpressing USC and inhibited the growth of P04626 -amplified tumour xenografts improving overall survival ( P=0.0017 ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB08916 may be highly effective against P04626 /neu-amplified chemotherapy-resistant USC . The investigation of afatinib in patients harbouring P04626 /neu-amplified USC is warranted .
