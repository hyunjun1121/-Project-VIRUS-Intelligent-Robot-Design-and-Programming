Chemoimmunotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . ALL blast cells express a variety of specific antigens e.g. P15391 , P11836 , P20273 , P20138 , and P31358 , which serve as targets for Monoclonal Antibodies ( MoAbs ) . So far , the most experience is available for anti- P11836 ( rituximab ) , which has been combined with chemotherapy for treatment of mature B-ALL/Burkitt 's lymphoma . Studies with rituximab have also been completed in B-precursor ALL . Another antigen , P15391 , is of great interest due to a very high rate of expression in ALL . It can be targeted by a bispecific monoclonal antibody , DB09052 , directed against P15391 and CD3 . Smaller studies or case reports are also available for the anti P31358 antibody ( DB00087 ) , for anti P20273 ( DB04958 ) or anti P20138 ( Gemtuzumab ) . Available data demonstrate that MoAb therapy in ALL is a highly promising targeted treatment . However , several details for an optimal treatment approach e.g. the required level of antigen expression , timing , schedule , dosage and stage of disease still need to be defined .
