Single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) enhance DB00761 - , acetylcholine- , and serotonin-induced contractions and evoke oxidative stress on rabbit ileum . We examined the effects of intravenous administration of purified arc-discharge single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) on rabbit ileum to establish the possibility of using these SWCNTs as cell markers or drug carriers for the treatment of intestinal diseases . The SWCNT purification process eliminated carbonaceous impurities and decreased the amount of metals . SWCNTs increased the contractile responses induced by DB00761 , acetylcholine ( ACh ) , and serotonin ( 5-HT ) in rabbit ileum . Verapamil , apamin , glibenclamide , quinine and charybdotoxin reduced the contractile responses induced by ACh and 5-HT in ileum from rabbits treated with SWCNTs , indicating that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and small , intermediate , and large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated , DB00171 -sensitive , and voltage-dependent K+ channels are involved in these effects . Atropine and hexamethonium reduced the ACh response , indicating that muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are involved in this effect . DB00904 and GR 113808 reduced the 5-HT response , indicating that serotonin 5- Q9H205 and Q13639 receptors are involved in this effect . SWCNTs increased the malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxyalkenals and carbonyl levels in rabbit plasma and ileum , indicating that SWCNTs produce oxidative stress . SWCNTs did not produce relevant histological changes or modify the levels of the inflammatory mediators P35228 and P35354 in the ileum . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that the intravenous administration of SWCNTs can evoke oxidative stress and affect contractility in rabbit ileum . These effects could reduce the possibility of using the arc-discharge SWCNTs as cell markers or drug carriers to treat intestinal diseases .
