Gene-based vaccines and immunotherapeutics . DNA vaccines , comprised of plasmid DNA encoding proteins from pathogens , allergens , and tumors , are being evaluated as prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic treatments for infectious diseases , allergies , and cancer ; plasmids encoding normal human proteins are likewise being tested as vaccines and treatments for autoimmune diseases . Examples of in vivo prophylaxis and immunotherapy , based on different types of immune responses ( humoral and cellular ) , in a variety of disease models and under evaluation in early phase human clinical trials are presented . Viral vectors continue to show better levels of expression than those achieved by DNA plasmid vectors . We have focused our clinical efforts , at this time , on the use of recombinant viral vectors for both vaccine as well as cytokine gene transfer studies . We currently have four clinical programs in cancer immunotherapy . Two nonspecific immunotherapy programs are underway that apply adenoviral vectors for the transfer of cytokine genes into tumors in situ . An adenovirus-IFN gamma construct ( TG1042 ) is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials in cutaneous lymphoma . A similar construct , adenovirus- P60568 ( TG1024 ) , also injected directly into solid tumors , is currently being tested in patients with solid tumors ( about one-half of which are melanoma ) . Encouraging results are seen in both programs . Two cancer vaccine immunotherapy programs focus on two cancer-associated antigens : human papilloma virus E6 and E7 proteins and the epithelial cancer-associated antigen P15941 . Both are encoded by a highly attenuated vaccinia virus vector [ modified vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) ] and both are coexpressed with P60568 . Encouraging results seen in both of these programs are described .
