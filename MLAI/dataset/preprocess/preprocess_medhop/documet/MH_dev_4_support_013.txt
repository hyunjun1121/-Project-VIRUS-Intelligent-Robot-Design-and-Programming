DB01373 /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II increases glutamate and noradrenaline release from synaptosomes . A variety of evidence indicates that calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation modulates the release of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals . For instance , the injection of rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II ) into the preterminal digit of the squid giant synapse leads to an increase in the release of a so-far unidentified neurotransmitter induced by presynaptic depolarization . But until now , it has not been demonstrated that Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II can also regulate neurotransmitter release in the vertebrate nervous system . Here we report that the introduction of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II , autoactivated by thiophosphorylation , into rat brain synaptosomes ( isolated nerve terminals ) increases the initial rate of induced release of two neurotransmitters , glutamate and noradrenaline . We also show that introduction of a selective peptidergic inhibitor of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II inhibits the initial rate of induced glutamate release . These results support the hypothesis that activation of Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent PK II in the nerve terminal removes a constraint on neurotransmitter release .
