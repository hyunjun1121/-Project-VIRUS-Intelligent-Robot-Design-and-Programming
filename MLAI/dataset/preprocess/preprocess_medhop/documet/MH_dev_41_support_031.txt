t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) is a recurring therapy-related translocation . Chromosome bands 1p36 and 3p21 are known to be recurring breakpoints in therapy-related ( t- ) leukemia . We identified a recurring translocation , t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) , in eight patients with various hematologic malignancies : three patients with ALL , one with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) in accelerated phase ( AP ) , two with P43034 , and two with AML(M3) . Five of the eight patients had a history of chemotherapy , including alkylating agents in three , before the translocation was detected . In two of these five patients , the t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) emerged only at relapse or in the accelerated phase of CML . The karyotypes of the patients were complex , including -7 and structural abnormalities of 5q , 6q , 7q , 9p , and 11q23 . Survival time varied among patients ( 25 days to more than 16 years ) . Using Q5TCZ1 with 13 1p35-36 cosmid probes ( tel-FB12- P35218 -G7-FD2- P21554 -ED8-FD9-G32- P48751 -G50-AD8-GG4-G43-cen ) , we delineated the 1p36 breakpoint in two patients with P43034 and ALL as lying between FB12 and FD2 ( between BAC47P3 and PAC963K15 ) , with a small deletion near the breakpoint in both cases . In the patient with P43034 , there was also a deletion at 3p21.3 , as detected with the cosmid probe cosNRL9 . The results of the present study suggest that t(1;3)(p36; P38936 ) in hematologic diseases is associated with prior exposure to mutagens , including alkylating agents .
