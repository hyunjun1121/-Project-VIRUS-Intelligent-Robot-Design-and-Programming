Arctic mutant Aβ40 aggregates on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inhibits their functions . Amyloid β protein ( Aβ ) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Point mutations within the Aβ sequence associated with familial AD ( DB03147 ) are clustered around the central hydrophobic core of Aβ . Several types of mutations within the Aβ sequence have been identified , and the ' Arctic ' mutation ( E22G ) has a purely cognitive phenotype typical of AD . Previous studies have shown that the primary result of the ' Arctic ' mutation is increased formation of Aβ protofibrils . However , the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown . Aβ42 binds to a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit , neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7 ( P36544 ) , with high affinity and , thus , may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD . Therefore , to clarify the molecular mechanism of Arctic mutation-mediated DB03147 , we focused on P36544 as a target molecule of Arctic Aβ . We performed an in vitro binding assay using purified P36544 and synthetic Arctic Aβ40 , and demonstrated that Arctic Aβ40 specifically bound to P36544 . The aggregation of Arctic Aβ40 was enhanced with the addition of P36544 . Furthermore , the function of P36544 was detected by measuring Ca(2+) flux and phospho- Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK ( P27361 /2 ) activation . Our results indicated that Arctic Aβ40 aggregation was enhanced by the addition of P36544 , which destabilized the function of P36544 via inhibition of Ca(2+) responses and activation of P27361 /2 . These findings indicate that Arctic Aβ mutation may be involved in the mechanism underlying DB03147 . This mechanism may involve binding and aggregation , leading to the inhibition of P36544 functions .
