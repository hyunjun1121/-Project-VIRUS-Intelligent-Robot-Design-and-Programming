P62937 is an inflammatory mediator that promotes atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice . P62937 ( CyPA ; encoded by Ppia ) is a ubiquitously expressed protein secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli . CyPA stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation , endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression , and inflammatory cell chemotaxis . Given these activities , we hypothesized that CyPA would promote atherosclerosis . P02649 -deficient ( Apoe(-/-) ) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet for 16 wk developed more severe atherosclerosis compared with Apoe(-/-)Ppia(-/-) mice . Moreover , CyPA deficiency was associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein uptake , P19320 ( vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ) expression , apoptosis , and increased P29474 ( endothelial nitric oxide synthase ) expression . To understand the vascular role of CyPA in atherosclerosis development , bone marrow ( BM ) cell transplantation was performed . Atherosclerosis was greater in Apoe(-/-) mice compared with Apoe(-/-)Ppia(-/-) mice after reconstitution with CyPA(+/+) BM cells , indicating that vascular-derived CyPA plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerosis . These data define a role for CyPA in atherosclerosis and suggest CyPA as a target for cardiovascular therapies .
