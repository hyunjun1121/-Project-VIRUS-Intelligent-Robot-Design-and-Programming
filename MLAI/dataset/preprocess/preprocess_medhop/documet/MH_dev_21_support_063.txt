O43609 promotes the degradation of Q03405 and inhibits Q03405 -mediated cell adhesion and proliferation . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is a P06744 anchored cell surface protein that is closely associated with invasion , migration , and metastasis of cancer cells . Many functional extracellular proteins and transmembrane receptors interact with Q03405 . However , few studies have examined the association of Q03405 with cytoplasm proteins . We previously used yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate several novel Q03405 -interacting cytoplasmic proteins , including Sprouty1 ( O43609 ) , an inhibitor of the ( Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ) MAPK pathway . In this study , we show that O43609 interacts with Q03405 and directs it toward lysosomal-mediated degradation . Overexpression of O43609 decreased the cell surface and cytoplasmic Q03405 protein level . Moreover , O43609 overexpression augmented Q03405 -induced cell adhesion to vitronectin as well as proliferation of cancer cells . Our results also further support the critical role of O43609 contribution to tumor growth . In a subcutaneous tumor model , overexpression of O43609 in HCT116 or A549 xenograft in athymic nude mice led to great suppression of tumor growth . These results show that O43609 may affect tumor cell function through direct interaction with Q03405 and promote its lysosomal degradation .
