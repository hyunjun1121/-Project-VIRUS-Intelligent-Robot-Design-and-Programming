Autocrine regulation of γ-irradiation-induced DNA damage response via extracellular nucleotides-mediated activation of Q15077 and Q9H244 receptors . A key component of the response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation is DNA repair . Release of extracellular nucleotides , such as DB00171 , from cells plays a role in signaling via P2 receptors . We show here that release of DB00171 , followed by activation of P2Y receptors , is involved in the response to γ-irradiation-induced DNA damage . Formation of phosphorylated histone variant P16104 ( γ P16104 ) foci , which are induced in nuclei by DNA damage and contribute to accumulation of DNA-repair factors , was increased at 1-3h after γ-ray irradiation ( 2.0Gy ) of human lung cancer A549 cells . Focus formation was suppressed by pre-treatment with the ecto-nucleotidase apyrase . Pre-treatment with ecto-nucleotidase inhibitor ARL67156 or post-treatment with DB00171 or UTP facilitated induction of γ P16104 , indicating that extracellular nucleotides play a role in induction of γ P16104 foci . Next , we examined the effect of P2 receptor inhibitors on activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ; a protein kinase ) and accumulation of Q12888 ( a DNA repair factor ) , both of which are important for DNA repair , at DNA damage sites . Q15077 receptor antagonist MRS2578 , Q9H244 receptor antagonist clopidogrel , and Q99572 receptor antagonists A438079 and oxATP significantly inhibited these processes . Release of DB00171 was detected within 2.5min after irradiation , but was blocked by A438079 . Activation of Q13315 and accumulation of Q12888 were decreased in Q15077 or Q9H244 receptor-knockdown cells . We conclude that autocrine/paracrine signaling through Q99572 -dependent DB00171 release and activation of Q15077 and Q9H244 receptors serves to amplify the cellular response to DNA damage caused by γ-irradiation .
