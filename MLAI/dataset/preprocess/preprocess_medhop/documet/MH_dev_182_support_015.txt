Cannabinoid receptors and T helper cells . We have reported that injection of marijuana cannabinoids , such as Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , into mice , followed by infection with Legionella pneumophila ( Lp ) , suppresses the development of cell-mediated immunity T helper 1 ( Th1 ) activity . These effects are accompanied by suppression of interleukin ( IL ) -12 and interferon ( IFN ) gamma production and enhancement of P05112 production suggesting THC-induced T helper cell biasing . In the current report , other T helper cell biasing mechanisms were studied . Mice were injected with THC followed 18 h later by a challenge infection with Lp . Two-hour post-infection , spleens were removed and analyzed for mRNA to either IL-12Rbeta2 or P23771 gene products . The results showed that THC suppressed IL-12Rbeta2 but increased P23771 . Receptor antagonists for P21554 ( SR141716A , SR1 ) and CB2 ( SR144528 , SR2 ) were also injected to analyze the involvement of cannabinoid receptors . It was determined that SR1 attenuated the THC suppression of IL-12Rbeta2 , while SR2 attenuated the increase in P23771 mRNA . These results suggest that THC suppresses Th1 biasing activity such as IL-12Rbeta2 by a P21554 mediated mechanism and enhances the Th2 biasing activity , P23771 , by a CB2 mechanism . This dichotomy of receptor involvement might result from differential expression and/or signaling function of P21554 and CB2 on Th1 and Th2 cells .
