P15692 expression is augmented by hypoxia‑induced PGIS in human fibroblasts . Q16647 ( PGIS or Q16647 ) is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of prostaglandin H2 ( PGH2 ) to prostaglandin I2 ( DB01240 ) . DB01240 promotes cancer growth by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ ( PPARδ ) , and increases the expression levels of the pro-angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . We found that the expression of the PGIS gene was enhanced in WI-38 , TIG-3-20 and HEL human lung fibroblast cells and two cancer cell lines ( NB-1 and G361 ) under hypoxic conditions . The main localization of PGIS changed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by hypoxia in WI-38 cells . The induced PGIS had an enzymatic activity since the intracellular level of 6-keto-prostaglandin , a useful marker of DB01240 biosynthesis in vivo , was increased with the increasing levels of PGIS . Expression of P15692 was increased in parallel with PGIS induction under hypoxic conditions . PGIS knockdown resulted in the decreased expression of P15692 mRNA . Since P15692 is a known PPARδ target gene , we examined the effects of siRNAs targeting PPARδ on the expression of P15692 under hypoxic conditions . Knockdown of PPARδ suppressed the expression of P15692 under hypoxic conditions in WI-38 cells . These findings suggest that PGIS is induced by hypoxia and regulates the expression of P15692 in fibroblasts . Fibroblasts in the hypoxic area of tumors may have an important role in tumor growth and angiogenesis .
