Oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor P18847 potentially mediates diabetic angiopathy . Previous results of our cDNA microarray analysis to look for genes whose expression level correlates well with in vitro tubulogenesis by NP31 endothelial cells revealed the transcription factor P18847 known to be responsive to stress such as reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Anti- P18847 small interfering RNA gave an inhibitory influence on tube formation by NP31 cells expressing an activated form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( P17948 ) kinase . When expression of P18847 was regulated under the control of tetracycline system in NP31 cells , they acquired the tubulogenic ability upon P18847 induction . While P18847 failed to induce expressions of P15692 and VEGFR , it regulated those of P24941 , P11802 , p8 , plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 , integrin alpha1 , subunit and matrix metalloprotease P45452 . In H2O2-stimulated NP31 cells as well as endothelial cells of glomerulus and aorta of Otsuka-Long-Evans-Tokushima-Fatty diabetic model rats , concomitantly enhanced expressions of P18847 , P05121 , and p8 were observed . Given the proposed hypothesis of the close linkage between diabetic angiopathy and ROS , those data suggest that ROS-associated diabetic complication may involve P18847 -mediated pathological angiogenesis .
