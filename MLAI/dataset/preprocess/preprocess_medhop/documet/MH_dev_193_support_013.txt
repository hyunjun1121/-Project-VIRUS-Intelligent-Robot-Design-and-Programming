Protective roles of epithelial cells in the survival of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells . Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) is a highly invasive and intractable T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 infection . We demonstrate herein that normal tissue-derived epithelial cells ( NECs ) exert protective effects on the survival of leukemic cells , which may partially account for high resistance to antileukemic therapies in patients with ATL . Viral gene-silenced , ATL-derived cell lines ( ATL cells ) dramatically escaped from histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis by direct co-culture with NECs . Adhesions to NECs suppressed P38936 (Cip1) expression and increased a proportion of resting G0/ P55008 phase cells in trichostatin A ( P32119 ) -treated ATL cells . ATL cells adhering to NECs down-regulated CD25 expression and enhanced vimentin expression , suggesting that most ATL cells acquired a quiescent state by cell-cell interactions with NECs . ATL cells adhering to NECs displayed highly elevated expression of the cancer stem cell marker P16070 . Blockade of P16070 signaling diminished the NEC-conferred resistance of ATL cells to P32119 -induced apoptosis . Co-culture with NECs also suppressed the expression of P26718 ligands on P32119 -treated ATL cells , resulting in decreased natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity . Combined evidence suggests that interactions with normal epithelial cells augment the resistance of ATL cells to P32119 -induced apoptosis and facilitate immune evasion by ATL cells .
