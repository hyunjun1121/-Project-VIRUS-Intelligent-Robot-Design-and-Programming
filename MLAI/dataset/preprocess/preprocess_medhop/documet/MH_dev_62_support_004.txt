P01375 and its inhibitors in cancer . P01375 ( P01375 ) -alpha is implicated in the same time in apoptosis and in cell proliferation . P01375 not only acts as pro-inflammatory cytokine conducing to wide spectrum of human diseases including inflammatory diseases , but can also induce tumor development . The molecular mechanisms of P01375 functions have been intensively investigated . In this review we covered P01375 , the molecule , its signaling pathway , and its therapeutic functions . We provide a particular insight in its paradoxical role in tumor promotion and in its use as anti-tumor agent . This review considers also the recent findings regarding P01375 inhibitors , their pharmacokinetics , and their pharmacodynamics . Six P01375 inhibitors have been considered here : DB00065 , DB00051 , Golimumab , DB08904 , CDP571 , DB00005 , and Thalidomide . We discussed the clinical relevance of their functions in treatment of several diseases such as advanced inflammatory rheumatic and bowel disease , with a focus in cancer treatment . Targeting P01375 by these drugs has many side effects like malignancies development , and the long-term sequels are not very well explored . Their efficacy and their safety were discussed , underscoring the necessity of close patients monitoring and of their caution use .
