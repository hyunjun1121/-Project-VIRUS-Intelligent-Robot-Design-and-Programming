Disruption of ERalpha signalling pathway by PPARgamma agonists : evidences of PPARgamma-independent events in two hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor that can be activated by natural ligands such as 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) as well as synthetic drugs such as thiazolidinediones . The treatment of human breast cancer cell lines with PPARgamma agonists is known to have antiproliferative effects but the role of PPARgamma activation in the process remains unclear . In the present study , we investigated the effects of four PPARgamma agonists , Rosiglitazone ( RGZ ) , DB09201 ( CGZ ) , DB00197 ( Q96PF1 ) and the natural agonist 15d-PGJ(2) , on estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) signalling pathway in two hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines , MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 . In both of them , Q96PF1 , CGZ and 15d-PGJ(2) induced an inhibition of ERalpha signalling associated with the proteasomal degradation of ERalpha . ZR-75-1 cells were more sensitive than MCF-7 cells to these compounds . Treatments that induced ERalpha degradation inhibited cell proliferation after 24 h . In contrast , 24 h exposure to RGZ , the most potent activator of PPARgamma disrupted neither ERalpha signalling nor cell proliferation . 9-cis retinoic acid never potentiated the proteasomal degradation of ERalpha . PPARgamma antagonists ( T0070907 , BADGE and GW 9662 ) did not block the proteolysis of ERalpha in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells treated with Q96PF1 . ERalpha proteolysis still occurred in case of PPARgamma silencing as well as in case of treatment with the PPARgamma-inactive compound Delta2- Q96PF1 , demonstrating a PPARgamma-independent mechanism . The use of thiazolidinedione derivatives able to trigger ERalpha degradation by a PPARgamma-independent pathway could be an interesting tool for breast cancer therapy .
