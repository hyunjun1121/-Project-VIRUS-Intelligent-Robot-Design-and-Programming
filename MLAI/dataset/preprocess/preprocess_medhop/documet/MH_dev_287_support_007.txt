Displacement of Q01826 -bound histone deacetylase 1 corepressor by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transactivator induces expression of interleukin-2 and its receptor in T cells . One hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is the dysregulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells . Transfection of T cells with human T-cell leukemia type 1 or 2 transactivator results in the induction of the T-cell-restricted cytokine interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) and its receptor ( IL-2Ralpha ) . However , no T-cell-specific factor(s) has been directly linked with the regulation of P60568 and IL-2Ralpha transcription by influencing the promoter activity . Thymocytes from Q01826 ( special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 ) knockout mice have been shown to ectopically express IL-2Ralpha , suggesting involvement of Q01826 in its negative regulation . Here we show that Q01826 , a T-cell-specific global gene regulator , binds to the promoters of human P60568 and IL-2Ralpha and recruits histone deacetylase 1 ( Q13547 ) in vivo . Q01826 also interacts with Tat in HIV-1-infected T cells . The functional interaction between HIV-1 Tat and Q01826 requires its PDZ-like domain , and the binding of the Q13547 corepressor occurs through the same . Furthermore , Tat competitively displaces Q13547 that is bound to Q01826 , leading to increased acetylation of the promoters in vivo . Transduction with Q01826 interaction-deficient soluble Tat ( Tat 40-72 ) and reporter assays using a transactivation-negative mutant ( C22G ) of Tat unequivocally demonstrated that the displacement of Q13547 itself is sufficient for derepression of these promoters in vivo . These results suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 Tat might overcome Q01826 -mediated repression in T cells .
