EGCG enhances the therapeutic potential of gemcitabine and CP690550 by inhibiting P40763 signaling pathway in human pancreatic cancer . BACKGROUND : Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( P40763 ) is an oncogene , which promotes cell survival , proliferation , motility and progression in cancer cells . Targeting P40763 signaling may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for human cancers . Here , we examined the effects of epigallocathechin gallate ( EGCG ) on P40763 signaling in pancreatic cancer cells , and assessed the therapeutic potential of EGCG with gemcitabine or P52333 inhibitor CP690550 ( DB08895 ) for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic cancer . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by XTT assay and TUNEL staining , respectively . Gene and protein expressions were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis , respectively . The results revealed that EGCG inhibited the expression of phospho and total P52333 and P40763 , P40763 transcription and activation , and the expression of P40763 -regulated genes , resulting in the inhibition of cell motility , migration and invasion , and the induction of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage . The inhibition of P40763 enhanced the inhibitory effects of EGCG on cell motility and viability . Additionally , gemcitabine and CP690550 alone inhibited P40763 target genes and synergized with EGCG to inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Overall , these results suggest that EGCG suppresses the growth , invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells , and induces apoptosis by interfering with the P40763 signaling pathway . Moreover , EGCG further enhanced the therapeutic potential of gemcitabine and CP690550 against pancreatic cancer .
