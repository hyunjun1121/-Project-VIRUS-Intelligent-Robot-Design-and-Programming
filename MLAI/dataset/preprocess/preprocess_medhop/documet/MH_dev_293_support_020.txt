DB08439 impairs early tendon repair but improves later remodeling . BACKGROUND : P35354 inhibitors inhibit bone repair . HYPOTHESIS : Cyclooxygenase inhibitors might also have a negative effect on early tendon repair , although a positive effect on late tendon repair previously has been shown . STUDY DESIGN : Controlled laboratory study . METHODS : Achilles tendon transection was performed on 80 rats . Sixty rats were given daily intramuscular injections of either parecoxib ( 6.4 mg/kg body weight ) or saline for the first 5 days after surgery and sacrificed either at 8 or 14 days . The remaining 20 rats were given intramuscular parecoxib or saline injections from day 6 until sacrifice at 14 days . RESULTS : At 8 days , early parecoxib treatment caused a 27 % decrease in force at failure ( P = .007 ) , a 25 % decrease in maximum stress ( P = .01 ) , and a 31 % decrease in energy uptake ( P = .05 ) . Stiffness and transverse area were not significantly affected . At 14 days , early parecoxib treatment caused a decrease in stiffness ( P = .004 ) . In contrast to early treatment , late parecoxib treatment caused a 16 % decrease in cross-sectional area ( P = .03 ) and a 29 % increase in maximum stress ( P = .04 ) . CONCLUSIONS : During early tendon repair , a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor had a detrimental effect . During remodelling , however , inflammation appears to have a negative influence , and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors might be of value . CLINICAL RELEVANCE : The results suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors should be used with care in the early period after tendon injury .
