Gq-mediated Akt translocation to the membrane : a novel PIP3-independent mechanism in platelets . Akt is an important signaling molecule regulating platelet aggregation . Akt is phosphorylated after translocation to the membrane through Gi signaling pathways by a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) -dependent mechanism . However , Akt is more robustly phosphorylated by thrombin compared with adenosine 5'-diphosphate in platelets . This study investigated the mechanisms of Akt translocation as a possible explanation for this difference . Stimulation of washed human platelets with protease-activated receptor agonists caused translocation of Akt to the membrane rapidly , whereas phosphorylation occurred later . The translocation of Akt was abolished in the presence of a Gq-selective inhibitor or in Gq-deficient murine platelets , indicating that Akt translocation is regulated downstream of Gq pathways . Interestingly , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors or Q9H244 antagonist abolished Akt phosphorylation without affecting Akt translocation to the membrane , suggesting that Akt translocation occurs through a PI3K/PIP3/Gi-independent mechanism . An Akt scaffolding protein , P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) , translocates to the membrane after stimulation with protease-activated receptor agonists in a Gq-dependent manner , with the kinetics of translocation similar to that of Akt . Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed constitutive association of PAK and Akt , suggesting a possible role of PAK in Akt translocation . These results show , for the first time , an important role of the Gq pathway in mediating Akt translocation to the membrane in a novel Gi/PI3K/PIP3-independent mechanism .
