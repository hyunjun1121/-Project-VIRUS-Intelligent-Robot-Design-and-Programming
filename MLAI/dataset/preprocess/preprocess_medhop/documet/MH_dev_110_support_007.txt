Attenuation of inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression by delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol is mediated through the inhibition of nuclear factor- kappa B/Rel activation. delta 9- DB00470 ( delta 9-THC ) a prototypic compound belonging to the family of agents known as cannabinoids , produces a wide variety of biological effects , including inhibition of immune function . The putative mechanism for cannabinoid biological action involves binding to cannabinoid receptor types 1 and 2 ( P21554 and CB2 ) to negatively regulate adenylate cyclase and inhibit intracellular signaling via the DB02527 cascade . In the current study , we show that delta 9-THC produces a marked inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) transcription and nitric oxide production by the macrophage line RAW 264.7 in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Analysis of RAW 264.7 cell RNA demonstrated transcripts for CB2 but not P21554 . Treatment of RAW 264.7 with delta 9-THC inhibited forskolin-stimulated DB02527 production in a dose-related manner , verifying the expression of functional cannabinoid receptors by this cell line . P35228 transcription , which is regulated in part by the nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel ( NF-kappa B/Rel ) family of transcription factors , has been shown to be under the control of the DB02527 signaling cascade . We demonstrate that delta 9-THC inhibits the activation and binding of NF-kappa B/Rel proteins to their cognate DNA site , kappa B , in response to LPS stimulation . LPS treatment of RAW 264.7 cells also induced the activation of the DB02527 cascade , as indicated by an increase in binding of nuclear factors to the DB02527 response element . Activation of CRE binding proteins was inhibited by delta 9-THC . DB02587 treatment of RAW 264.7 cells induced both kappa B and DB02527 response element binding activity and was likewise inhibited by delta 9-THC . Collectively , this series of experiments indicates that NF-kappa B/Rel is positively regulated by the DB02527 cascade to help initiate P35228 gene expression in response to LPS stimulation of macrophages . This activation of P35228 is attenuated by delta 9-THC through the inhibition of DB02527 signaling .
