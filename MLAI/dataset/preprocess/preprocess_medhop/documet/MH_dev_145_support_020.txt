Molecular characterization of de novo Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia . Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a controversial diagnosis , as others propose that it represents chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase ( CML-BP ) . P06748 mutations occur in 25-35 % of patients with AML but are absent in patients with CML . Conversely , P00519 mutations occur in 25 % of imatinib-naive patients with CML-BP but are not described in patients with AML . We analyzed for P06748 and P00519 mutations in nine Ph+ patients with AML and five patients with CML-BP initially presenting in BP . In six cases of Ph+ AML , we screened for a panel of gene mutations using Sequenome(Â®)-based methods including P31749 , P31751 , Q9Y243 , P15056 , P00533 , P50148 , GNAS , O75874 , P48735 , P01116 , MET , P01111 , P42336 and P07949 . Two of nine ( 22 % ) patients with Ph+ AML had P06748 mutations and were alive 36 and 71 months after diagnosis . All cases of Ph+ AML were negative for P00519 and other gene mutations . One ( 20 % ) patient with CML-BP had P00519 mutation ; no patients had P06748 mutations . These data suggest that Ph+ AML is distinct from CML-BP .
