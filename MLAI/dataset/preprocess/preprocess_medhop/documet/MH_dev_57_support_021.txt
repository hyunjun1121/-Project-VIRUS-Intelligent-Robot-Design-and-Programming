Genome-wide association study identifies O95150 and Q16633 as susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis in the Japanese population . For the identification of susceptibility loci for primary biliary cirrhosis ( P10515 ) , a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) was performed in 963 Japanese individuals ( 487 P10515 cases and 476 healthy controls ) and in a subsequent replication study that included 1,402 other Japanese individuals ( 787 cases and 615 controls ) . In addition to the most significant susceptibility region , human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) , we identified two significant susceptibility loci , O95150 ( rs4979462 ) and Q16633 ( rs4938534 ) ( combined odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.56 , p = 2.84 × 10(-14) for rs4979462 , and combined OR = 1.39 , p = 2.38 × 10(-8) for rs4938534 ) . Among 21 non-HLA susceptibility loci for P10515 identified in GWASs of individuals of European descent , three loci ( P16871 , Q9UKT9 , and P33681 ) showed significant associations ( combined p = 3.66 × 10(-8) , 3.66 × 10(-9) , and 3.04 × 10(-9) , respectively ) and Q14765 and P19838 loci showed suggestive association with P10515 ( combined p = 1.11 × 10(-6) and 1.42 × 10(-7) , respectively ) in the Japanese population . These observations indicated the existence of ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility loci to P10515 and the importance of P01375 signaling and B cell differentiation for the development of P10515 in individuals of European descent and Japanese individuals .
