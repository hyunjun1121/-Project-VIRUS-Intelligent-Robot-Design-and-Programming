DB08881 -induced interface dermatitis manifesting as radiation-recall and a keratosis pilaris-like eruption . DB08881 is a specific inhibitor of the V600E mutated P15056 protein kinase used for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma harboring this mutation . Multiple predictable side effects have been described with use of this targeted therapy , and implicate P15056 and mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways in their pathogenesis . Herein , we report the novel finding of an interface dermatitis in radiation recall and a keratosis pilaris-like clinical reaction in a patient treated with vemurafenib .
