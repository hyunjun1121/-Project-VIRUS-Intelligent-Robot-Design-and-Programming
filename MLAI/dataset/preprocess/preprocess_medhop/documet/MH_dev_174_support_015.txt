Anti-allergic effects of nilotinib on mast cell-mediated anaphylaxis like reactions . DB04868 is a new orally bioavailable potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used for the treatment of P11274 - P00519 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia . However , its effect on mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reaction is still not known . The present study aimed to investigate the effect of nilotinib on the anaphylactic allergic reaction and study its possible mechanism(s) of action . DB04868 administration prevented systemic anaphylaxis in mice , mediated by compound 48/80 , in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Also , nilotinib significantly inhibited ( P < 0.05 ) allergic paw edema in rats . Furthermore , nilotinib significantly decreased ( P < 0.05 ) the IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in a dose dependent manner . In addition , nilotinib dose-dependently reduced histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells activated either by compound 48/80 or by ovalbumin . Moreover , nilotinib attenuated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -Î± expression in the rat peritoneal mast cells . These findings provide evidence that nilotinib inhibits mast cell-derived immediate-type allergic reactions and so it could be a candidate as an anti-allergic agent .
