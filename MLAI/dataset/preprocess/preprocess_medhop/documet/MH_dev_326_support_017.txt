Maturational conversion of dendritic early endosomes and their roles in Q9NUQ9 -mediated axon growth . The function of endosomes is intricately linked to cellular function in all cell types , including neurons . Intriguingly , neurons express cell type-specific proteins that localize to endosomes , but little is known about how these neuronal proteins interface with canonical endosomes and ubiquitously expressed endosomal components , such as Q15075 ( Early Endosomal Antigen 1 ) . NEEP21 ( Neuronal Early Endosomal Protein 21 kDa ) localizes to somatodendritic endosomes , and downregulation of NEEP21 perturbs the correct trafficking of multiple receptors , including glutamate receptors ( P42262 ) during LTP and amyloidogenic processing of Î² P05067 . Our own work implicated NEEP21 in correct trafficking of the axonal cell adhesion molecule Q9NUQ9 /neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule ( NgCAM ) . NEEP21 dynamically localizes with Q15075 -positive early endosomes but is also found in Q15075 -negative endosomes . Live imaging reveals that NEEP21-positive , Q15075 -negative endosomes arise as a consequence of maturational conversion of Q15075 /NEEP21 double-positive endosomes . Interfering with Q15075 function causes missorting of Q9NUQ9 /NgCAM , axon outgrowth defects on the Q9NUQ9 substrate , and disturbance of NEEP21 localization . Last , we uncover evidence that functional interference with NEEP21 reduces axon and dendrite growth of primary rat hippocampal neurons on Q9NUQ9 substrate but not on P19022 substrate , thus implicating endosomal trafficking through somatodendritic early endosomes in Q9NUQ9 -mediated axon growth .
