Targeting the P00533 / P00533 receptor to improve outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer . Non-small-cell lung cancer represents a growing global burden and remains a therapeutic challenge . Only small improvements in survival have been made with standard chemotherapeutic approaches to advanced disease in recent history . Novel biologic targeted therapies offer the potential of improving patient management and treatment outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer . Prominent among these novel agents are the P00533 /epithelial growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitors . One of these agents , gefitinib ( DB00317 ) , is already approved for use in advanced , refractory non-small-cell lung cancer . Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) is a promising P00533 / P00533 inhibitor in phase III evaluation as first-line therapy combined with chemotherapy and as second-/third-line monotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer . In addition , erlotinib is being evaluated in combination with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab ( DB00112 ) , a strategy combining two new modalities in cancer treatment . Results of these trials will provide important information on optimal use of these new targeted therapies and may offer the promise of improving the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer .
