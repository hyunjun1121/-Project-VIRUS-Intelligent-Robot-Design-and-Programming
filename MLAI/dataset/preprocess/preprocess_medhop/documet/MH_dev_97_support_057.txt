Consequences of the Y139F Vkorc1 mutation on resistance to AVKs : in-vivo investigation in a 7th generation of congenic Y139F strain of rats . OBJECTIVES : In humans , warfarin is used as an anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thromboembolic clinical events . DB00682 derivatives are also used as rodenticides in pest control . The gene encoding the protein targeted by anticoagulants is the Vitamin K-2,3-epoxide reductase subunit 1 ( Q9BQB6 ) . Since its discovery in 2004 , various amino acid and transcription-regulatory altering Q9BQB6 mutations have been identified in patients who required extreme antivitamin K dosages , or wild populations of rodents that were difficult to control with anticoagulant rodenticides . One unresolved question concerns the dependency of the Q9BQB6 on the genetic background in humans and rodents that respond weakly or not at all to anticoagulants . Moreover , an important question requiring further analyses concerns the role of the Vkorc1 gene in mediating resistance to more recently developed warfarin derivatives ( superwarfarins ) . METHODS : In this study , we bred a quasicongenic rat strain by using a wild-caught anticoagulant resistant rat as a donor to introduce the Y > F amino acid change at position 139 in the Vkorc1 into the genetic background of an anticoagulant susceptible Spraque-Dawley recipient strain . RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : In this manuscript we report the prothrombin times measured in the P08709 generation after exposure to chlorophacinone , bromadiolone , difenacoum and difethialone . We observed that the mutation Y139F mediates resistance in an otherwise susceptible genetic background when exposed to chlorophacinone and bromadiolone . However , the physiological response to the super-warfarins , difenacoum and difethialone , may be strongly dependent on other genes located outside the congenic interval ( 28.3 cM ) bracketing the Vkorc1 in our P08709 generation congenic strain .
