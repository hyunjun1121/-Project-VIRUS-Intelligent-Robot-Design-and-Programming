DB05258 /beta promotes cell survival by activating nuclear factor kappa B through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt . Interferons ( IFNs ) play critical roles in host defense by modulating gene expression via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( P35610 ) factors . IFN-alpha/beta also activates another transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which protects cells against apoptotic stimuli . NF-kappaB activation requires the IFN-dependent association of P40763 with the P17181 chain of the IFN receptor . IFN-dependent NF-kappaB activation involves the sequential activation of a serine kinase cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI-3K ) and Akt . Whereas constitutively active PI-3K and Akt induce NF-kappaB activation , Ly294002 ( a PI-3K inhibitor ) , dominant-negative PI-3K , and kinase-dead Akt block IFN-dependent NF-kappaB activation . Moreover , dominant-negative PI-3K blocks IFN-promoted degradation of kappaBox alpha . Ly294002 , a dominant-negative PI-3K construct , and kinase-dead Akt block IFN-promoted cell survival , enhancing apoptotic cell death . Therefore , P40763 , PI-3K , and Akt are components of an IFN signaling pathway that promotes cell survival through NF-kappaB activation .
