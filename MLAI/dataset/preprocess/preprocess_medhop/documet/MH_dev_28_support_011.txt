Targeted deletion of Kcne2 causes gastritis cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia . Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide . Predisposing factors include achlorhydria , Helicobacter pylori infection , oxyntic atrophy and Q03403 -expressing metaplasia . In parietal cells , apical potassium channels comprising the P51787 alpha subunit and the Q9Y6J6 beta subunit provide a K(+) efflux current to facilitate gastric acid secretion by the apical H(+)K(+)ATPase . Accordingly , genetic deletion of murine Kcnq1 or Kcne2 impairs gastric acid secretion . Other evidence has suggested a role for Q9Y6J6 in human gastric cancer cell proliferation , independent of its role in gastric acidification . Here , we demonstrate that 1-year-old Kcne2(-/-) mice in a pathogen-free environment all exhibit a severe gastric preneoplastic phenotype comprising gastritis cystica profunda , 6-fold increased stomach mass , increased Ki67 and nuclear P12004 D1 expression , and Q03403 - and cytokeratin 7-expressing metaplasia . Some Kcne2(-/-) mice also exhibited pyloric polypoid adenomas extending into the duodenum , and neoplastic invasion of thin walled vessels in the sub-mucosa . Finally , analysis of human gastric cancer tissue indicated reduced parietal cell Q9Y6J6 expression . Together with previous findings , the results suggest Q9Y6J6 disruption as a possible risk factor for gastric neoplasia .
