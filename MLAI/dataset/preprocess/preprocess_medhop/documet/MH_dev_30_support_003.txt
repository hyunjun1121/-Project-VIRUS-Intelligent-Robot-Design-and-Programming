Polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokines and Fcgamma receptors in childhood chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura : a pilot study . Inflammatory cytokines and low-affinity Fcgamma receptor ( FcgammaR ) polymorphisms were investigated in 37 children with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( cITP ) and 218 controls . Genotype analysis included common variants in the regulatory regions of cytokines , P01375 , P01374 , P18510 , P01583 , P01584 , P05112 , P05231 and P22301 , and structural variants of the low affinity FcgammaRs , P12318 , P08637 and O75015 . Associations were observed for P01375 ( P = 0.0032 ) , P01374 ( P = 0.019 ) , P08637 ( P = 0.038 ) and O75015 ( P = 0.0034 ) . Two combinations of genotypes ( P01375 and P08637 ; P = 0.0003 , and P01374 and O75015 ; P = 0.011 ) were significantly associated with cITP . These results provide preliminary evidence that variant genotypes of FcgammaRs and cytokines contribute to cITP pathogenesis .
