Delivering minocycline into brain endothelial cells with liposome-based technology . DB01017 has been proposed as a way to blunt neurovascular injury from matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) during stroke . However , recent clinical trials suggest that high levels of minocycline may have deleterious side-effects . Here , we showed that very high minocycline concentrations damage endothelial cells via calpain/caspase pathways . To alleviate this potential cytotoxicity , we encapsulated minocycline in liposomes . Low concentrations of minocycline could not reduce tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) -induced P14780 release from endothelial cells . But low concentrations of minocycline-loaded liposomes significantly reduced TNFα-induced P14780 release . This study provides proof-of-concept that liposomes may be used to deliver lower levels of minocycline for targeting MMPs in cerebral endothelium .
