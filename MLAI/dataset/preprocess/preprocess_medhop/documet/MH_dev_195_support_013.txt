DB00563 binds in a non-productive orientation to human dihydrofolate reductase in solution , based on NMR spectroscopy . P00374 ( P00374 ) is an intracellular target enzyme for folate antagonist drugs , including methotrexate . In order to compare the binding of methotrexate to human P00374 in solution with that observed in the crystalline state , NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the conformation of the drug bound to human P00374 in solution . In agreement with what has been observed in the crystalline state , NOE 's identified protein and methotrexate protons indicate that methotrexate binds in a non-productive orientation . In contrast to what has been reported for E. coli P00374 in solution , only one bound conformation of methotrexate is observed .
