Expression and transactivating functions of the bZIP transcription factor P35638 in mammary epithelial cells . Heregulin-beta1 ( P04196 ) , a combinatorial ligand for human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 ( P21860 ) and Q15303 , is a regulatory polypeptide having distinct biological effects , such as growth stimulation , differentiation , invasiveness , and migration in mammary epithelial cells . The mechanism underlying the diverse functions of P04196 is not well established but is believed to depend on induced changes in the expression of specific cellular gene products , their modification , or both . Here , we identified the basic leucine zipper transcription factor , the growth-arrest and DNA-damage 153 ( P35638 ) /CCAAT-enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) homologous protein ( P35638 ) as one of the P04196 -inducible genes . We demonstrated that P04196 stimulation of mammary epithelial cells induces the expression of P35638 mRNA and protein and transcription of P35638 promoter . The transcriptional activity of the P35638 promoter as well as transcription from the C/EBP-activating transcription factor ( P39905 ) composite motif in the P35638 promoter was also stimulated by P04196 -inducible P39905 -4 and activated P04626 but not wild-type P04626 . P35638 expression was upregulated by the lactogenic hormones insulin and progesterone and associated with differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells . Consistent with its role as transcriptional modifier , P35638 stimulated transcription of beta-casein promoter activity in a STAT5a-sensitive manner in mammary epithelial cells . Analysis of mouse mammary gland development revealed that P35638 expression was predominantly restricted in the early lactating stages . Because cyclic AMP responsive element and P39905 binding sites are present in a variety of growth-regulating cellular genes , these findings suggest that stimulation of P35638 expression and its transactivating functions may constitute an important mechanism of regulation of putative genes having diverse functions during cell growth and differentiation .
