DB08916 for the treatment of patients with P00533 -positive non-small cell lung cancer . P00533 ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are valuable treatments for P00533 -mutated non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Anti- P00533 antibodies are widely used in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) and in P01116 wild-type colorectal cancer . The first-generation , reversible P00533 inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib in the first-line setting provide superior progression-free survival and quality of life compared to conventional chemotherapy in NSCLC harboring activating P00533 mutations . However , these therapies eventually fail and new options are needed . DB08916 is a novel irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family members P00533 , tyrosine kinase-type cell surface receptors P04626 and Q15303 . It shows preclinical efficacy in NSCLC with common P00533 -activating mutations and the T790M mutation typically associated with P00533 TKI resistance . Preclinical activity is seen in other tumor types as well , including HNSCC . Clinically , afatinib has been evaluated in the broad-reaching LUX Lung trial program , with significant activity seen in the first and later-line settings . It is also under investigation in multiple other tumor types . This review will stress on afatinib 's preclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics and clinical activity with a focus on NSCLC .
