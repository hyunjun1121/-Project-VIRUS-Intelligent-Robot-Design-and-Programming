P04150 overexpression exerts an antisurvival effect on human small cell lung cancer cells . Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) is an aggressive tumour with an abysmal prognosis . These cancers are characteristically resistant to glucocorticoid ( Gc ) action , owing to impaired expression of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) . We identified reduced GR expression in human SCLC cell lines , compared to a non-SCLC cell line . The SCLC cells also showed no Gc inhibition of proliferation , in contrast to non-SCLC cells . Retroviral overexpression of GR resulted in significantly increased cell death , which was partially blocked by the GR antagonist , DB00834 . Indeed , in cells sorted for GR expression , there was rapid , near complete loss of live cells by 72 h , in contrast to control cells that proliferated as expected . Flow cytometry using P08758 revealed that cell death was by apoptosis . In addition , confocal analysis of fixed cells showed that cells overexpressing GR displayed a significant increase in fragmenting apoptotic nuclei . Microarray studies showed that transgenic GR expression upregulated the proapoptotic genes , Q92934 and Q07812 . We have , therefore , identified a profound apoptotic effect of GR in SCLC cells , which may explain the low levels of endogenous GR in SCLC cells . Understanding how GR overexpression leads to apoptotic cell death in SCLC cells may uncover new therapeutic strategies .
