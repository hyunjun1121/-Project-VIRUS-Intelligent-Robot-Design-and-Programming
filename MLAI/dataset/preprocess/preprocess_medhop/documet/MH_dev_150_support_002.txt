Androgen receptors . DB00624 and its active metabolite dihydrotestosterone exert their influence on target cells through a specific intracellular protein receptor . Structural abnormalities of this receptor lead to a diminished androgen action within the cell and result in the syndrome of androgen insensitivity . Androgen insensitivity is classified on the basis of whether the insensitivity is complete or partial and whether the androgen receptor is normally present ( AR(+) ) , absent ( AR(-) ) or diminished ( AR(+/-) ) . All patients with androgen insensitivity have normal or high plasma levels of testosterone and elevated serum LH . Patients with complete androgen insensitivity are phenotypically female . The clinical presentation of partial androgen insensitivity is variable , ranging from a minimal amount of virilization to a completely masculine appearance . All patients described with a syndrome of androgen insensitivity are infertile . The influence of androgen receptor function in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hypertrophy is being investigated . P10275 content is also being studied as a possible marker of responsiveness to hormonal therapy in prostatic carcinoma .
