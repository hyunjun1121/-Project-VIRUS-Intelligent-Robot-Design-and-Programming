Effects of ethanol on the properties of platelets and endothelial cells in model experiments . AIM : To investigate effects of ethanol on activity markers of atherosclerosis in an in vitro endothelial cell model . METHODS : After 24 h incubation with ethanol ( 0.0095 % ) , human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated for 1 h with lipopolysaccharide , and were then incubated in direct contact with activated platelets . Following this incubation , the expression of P29965 and CD62P on platelets , and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) , urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , and membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) on endothelial cells were measured by flow cytometry . RESULTS : The increased expression of P19320 and Q03405 on endothelial cells by proinflammatory stimulation with activated platelets was significantly reduced through pre-incubation with ethanol ( P < 0.05 ) . Furthermore , platelets in direct contact with ethanol and with endothelial cells pre-incubated in ethanol showed a significant reduction in their P29965 expression ( P < 0.05 ) . DB00898 had no significant effect on P05362 and P50281 expression on endothelial cells . CONCLUSION : DB00898 directly attenuates platelet activation and has significant endothelial cell-mediated effects on selected markers of atherosclerosis in vitro . These findings underline possible protective effects of ethanol on atherosclerosis .
