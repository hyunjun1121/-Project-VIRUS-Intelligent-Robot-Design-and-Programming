[ Antinociceptive mechanism of action of paracetamol ] . The mechanism of action of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) is still not clearly understood . Unlike morphine , for example , paracetamol has no known endogenous high-affinity binding sites . In addition , paracetamol does not appear to share with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) the capacity to inhibit peripheral cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) activity . There is currently considerable evidence to support the hypothesis of a central antinociceptive effect . Although various biochemical studies point to inhibition of central P35354 activity , the existence of a P36551 activity that is selectively susceptible to paracetamol ( P36551 -3 ? ) is an alternative hypothesis . Modulation of the serotoninergic system has also been suggested on the basis of biochemical and behavioural studies supporting an indirect serotoninergic ( 5-HT ) effect . DB00316 may stimulate the activity of descending 5-HT pathways that inhibit nociceptive signal transmission in the spinal cord . Support for this possibility has come from evidence that spinally administered antagonists of several 5-HT receptor subtypes abolish the antinociceptive activity of paracetamol . These hypotheses have yet to be confirmed by further studies . Until then , the primary pharmacological mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of paracetamol has still to be clearly defined .
