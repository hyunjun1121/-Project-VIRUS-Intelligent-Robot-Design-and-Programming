Effects of FK506 on rat thymic epithelial cells ; immunohistochemical study . The effects of FK506 , a new immunosuppressive agent , on the rat thymus were investigated using the immunoperoxidase technique and flow cytofluorometry using monoclonal antibodies . Flow cytometric analysis of the thymus revealed that the proportion of cells labelled positively with OX7 ( P04216 ) , OX8 ( CD8 , T cytotoxic/suppressor cells ) and W3/25 ( P01730 , T helper cells and macrophages ) increased following treatment , with FK506 , 1 mg/kg body weight for 14 days . A marked reduction of the thymic medulla following treatment was clearly demonstrated by staining with OX18 ( MHC class I ) and OX6 ( MHC class II ) . Changes produced by FK506 were also observed in the cortical area of the thymus , being especially marked in the subcapsular area and around the blood vessels by staining with OX6 , P03952 -1 ( alpha-cytokeratin ) , AB-1040 ( type IV collagen ) , and AB-1220 ( laminin ) . Eventually FK506 treatment resulted in patchy reduction of OX-6 , P03952 -1 , AB-1040 and AB-1220 positive area in the cortex . This evidence suggests that FK506 may impair the thymic microenvironment and subsequently disturb the thymocyte maturation .
