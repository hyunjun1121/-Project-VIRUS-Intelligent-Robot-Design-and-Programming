Antitumor activity of arsenic trioxide on retinoblastoma : cell differentiation and apoptosis depending on arsenic trioxide concentration . PURPOSE : DB01169 ( ATO ) targets multiple pathways in malignant cells , resulting in the promotion of differentiation or in the induction of apoptosis . The antitumor activity of ATO on retinoblastoma was investigated . METHODS : Human retinoblastoma cells were incubated with various ATO concentrations . The antiproliferative effect of ATO was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay , and the effect of ATO on cell-cycle progression was validated by flow cytometry . At a low concentration , the ATO-induced differentiation of retinoblastoma cells was evaluated by neurofilament expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 activation , which was confirmed by the inhibition of P27361 /2 . At a high concentration , ATO-induced H(2)O(2) production was investigated with the cell-permeable fluorescent dye 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate , and the relationship of ATO-induced H(2)O(2) production with caspase-3-dependent apoptosis was validated by Western blot and 4'6-diamidino-2-phenolindole staining , which was confirmed by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) inhibition . The effect of ATO on tumor formation was assessed with an orthotopic animal model of retinoblastoma . RESULTS : The antitumor activity of ATO in retinoblastoma was related to two main mechanisms , differentiation and apoptosis , which were determined by the level of ATO . At a low dose ( < or= 1 microM ) , ATO induced the differentiation of retinoblastoma cells through P27361 /2 activation , whereas ROS generation by a high dose ( > or= 2 microM ) of ATO induced apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells . Moreover , ATO at low and high doses effectively inhibited tumor formation . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that ATO can be used as an effective alternative therapeutic for the treatment of retinoblastoma .
