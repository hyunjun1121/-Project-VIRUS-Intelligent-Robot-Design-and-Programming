Molecular-pathological prognostic factors of gastric cancer : a review . Invasion and metastasis are critical determinants of cancer morbidity . Genes and molecules participating in these steps must be regarded as potential prognostic factors . Growth factors and their receptors , cell-cycle regulators , cell-adhesion molecules and matrix-degrading enzymes are those to be used as prognostic factors , including epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , P01133 receptor , P21802 , HER-2 , interleukin ( IL ) -8 , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , cyclin E , p27 , P12830 , CD44v6 , matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( P03956 ) , and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( P01033 ) . Alterations in epigenetics , such as aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification that are , in part , associated with the tumor progression of gastric cancer , can be candidate prognostic factors . The number of methylated genes may serve as a marker of tumor progression . Genetic polymorphism not only affects cancer susceptibility but also influences malignant phenotype ; examples include single-nucleotide polymorphism in the HER-2 and P14780 genes . Comprehensive gene expression analyses are useful to search for novel genes related to invasion and metastasis and potential prognostic factors . Serial analysis of gene expression ( Q9NXZ1 ) has identified several these genes , such as Q12864 , P02649 , P35637 , P02452 , P08123 , Q6UX06 , and Q16674 . Overexpression of Q16674 is found to be associated with poor prognosis . Microarray analysis has great potential for identifying the characteristics of individual cancers , from the view point of gene expression profiles . A combination of these examinations can not only foretell a patient 's prognosis but can also give information directly connected with personalized cancer medicine and prevention .
