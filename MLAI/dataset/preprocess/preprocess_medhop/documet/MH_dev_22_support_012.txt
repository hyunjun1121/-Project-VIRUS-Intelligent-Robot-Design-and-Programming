Treatment of P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer . The HER family of receptors consists of four closely related type 1 transmembrane TK receptors : P00533 ( P00533 ) , P04626 , P21860 and Q15303 . Signalling via the HER family of receptors underpins the majority of the intricate array of cellular activities on which cell survival and functionality depend . Aberrant P04626 expression and/or functionality have been implicated in the evolution of breast cancer and this receptor has proved to be a potent target for anticancer therapies , including antibody-based therapies to prevent ligand binding , dimer formation or the recruitment of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity , and direct kinase inhibition to prevent molecular activation and recruitment of downstream signalling partners . Novel strategies against P04626 include HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors , HSP90 inhibitors and antibody-chemotherapy conjugates . This latter approach is exemplified by DB05773 , a potent antibody that has a good safety profile and that has shown remarkable activity in patients with advanced disease . In addition , pertuzumab , an mAb that directly inhibits the formation of P04626 dimers including the P04626 : P21860 dimer , offers a unique mechanism of P21860 inhibition . All these approaches have shown substantial clinical activity in patients refractory to trastuzumab . It is anticipated that with the increased availability of novel anti- P04626 agents together with a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to anti- P04626 agents we should be able to further improve the outcome of patients with P04626 breast cancer . There will also be an increasing tendency towards moving the study of these agents to earlier stages of the disease , namely in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting .
