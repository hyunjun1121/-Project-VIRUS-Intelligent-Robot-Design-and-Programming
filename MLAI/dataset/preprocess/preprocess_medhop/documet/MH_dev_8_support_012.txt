P15692 trap as a novel antiangiogenic treatment currently in clinical trials for cancer and eye diseases , and VelociGene- based discovery of the next generation of angiogenesis targets . The concept that tumors can be controlled by directly targeting their vascular supply has finally come of age , because clinical trials using a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks P15692 have demonstrated exciting efficacy in cancer patients , as well as in vascular eye diseases that can lead to blindness . However , data suggest that these current regimens may not provide complete P15692 inhibition and , thus , that the maximum therapeutic potential of P15692 blockade has not yet been achieved . We describe the status of a very potent and high-affinity P15692 blocker , termed the DB08885 , that may provide the opportunity to maximize the potential of P15692 blockade in cancer as well as in vascular eye diseases . We also describe use of the DB08885 as a research tool , when coupled to high-throughput mouse genetics approaches such as VelociGene that can be exploited in strategies to discover and validate the next generation of angiogenesis targets .
