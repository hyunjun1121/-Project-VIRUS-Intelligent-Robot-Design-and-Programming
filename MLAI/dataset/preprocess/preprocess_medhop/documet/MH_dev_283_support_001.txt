P03952 suppresses tumor growth and is decreased in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin . Non-melanoma skin cancer represents the most common cancer in the United States . Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the skin is a subtype of NMSC that shows a greater potential for invasion and metastasis . The current study identifies the protein kinase C-associated kinase ( P03952 ) , which is also known as the receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 , as a suppressor of tumor growth in SCC of the skin . We show that expression of P03952 is decreased in human SCC of the skin compared with normal skin . Further , suppression of P03952 in human keratinocytes leads to increased cell proliferation . The use of RNA interference to reduce P03952 expression in keratinocytes leads to an increase in S phase and in proteins that promote cell cycle progression . Consistent with the results obtained from cell culture , there is a marked increased tumorigenesis after P03952 knockdown in a xenotransplant model and in soft agar assays . The loss of tumor suppression involves the NF-κB and p63 pathways . NF-κB is inhibited through inhibition of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase function and there is increased nuclear Q9H3D4 activity after P03952 knockdown . This study opens new avenues both in the discovery of disease pathogenesis and for potential treatments .
