Sex-specific alterations in hippocampal cannabinoid 1 receptor expression following adolescent DB00470 treatment in the rat . Marijuana use by adolescents has been on the rise since the early 1990s . With recent legalization and decriminalization acts passed , cannabinoid exposure in adolescents will undoubtedly increase . Human studies are limited in their ability to examine underlying changes in brain biochemistry making rodent models valuable . Studies in adult and adolescent animals show region and sex specific downregulation of the cannabinoid 1 ( P21554 ) receptor following chronic cannabinoid treatment . However , although sex-dependent changes in behavior have been observed during the drug abstinence period following adolescent cannabinoid exposure , little is known about P21554 receptor expression during this critical time . In order to characterize P21554 receptor expression following chronic adolescent Î”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) exposure , we used [ (3)H ] CP55,940 binding to assess P21554 receptor expression in the dentate gyrus and areas P00915 , P00918 , and P07451 of the hippocampus in both male and female adolescent rats at both 24h and 2 weeks post chronic THC treatment . Consistent with other reported findings , we found downregulation of the P21554 receptor in the hippocampal formation at 24h post treatment . While this downregulation persisted in both sexes following two weeks of abstinence in the P00918 region , in females , this downregulation also persisted in areas P00915 and P07451 . Expression in the dentate gyrus returned to the normal range by two weeks . These data suggest that selective regions of the hippocampus show persistent reductions in P21554 receptor expression and that these reductions are more widespread in female compared to male adolescents .
