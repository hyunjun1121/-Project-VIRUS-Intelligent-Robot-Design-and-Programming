Reduction of airway anion secretion via P13569 in sphingomyelin pathway . The present study concerns the involvement of the ceramide produced through sphingomyelinase ( SMase ) -mediated catalysis in airway anion secretion of Calu-3 cells . Short-circuit current ( Isc ) measurement revealed that isoproterenol ( ISO , 0.1 microM ) -induced anion secretion was prevented by pretreatment with SMase ( 0.3 U/ml , for 30 min ) from the basolateral but not the apical side , although basal and 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone ( 1-EBIO , a Ca2+-activated K+ channel opener ) -induced Isc were unaffected . The effects of SMase were reproduced in responses to forskolin ( 20 microM ) or 8-bromo- DB02527 ( 2 mM ) . P06681 -ceramide , a cell-permeable analog , also repressed the 8-bromo- DB02527 -induced responses . Nystatin permeabilization studies confirmed that the SMase- and P06681 -ceramide-induced repressions were due to hindrance of augmentation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) -mediated conductance across the apical membrane . Further , SMase failed to influence K+ conductance across the basolateral membrane . These results suggest that the ceramide originating from basolateral sphingomyelin acts on activated P13569 from the cytosolic side , hindering anion secretion .
