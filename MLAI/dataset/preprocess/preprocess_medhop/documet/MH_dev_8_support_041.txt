P05121 plays a protective role in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice : role of hepatocyte division . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is an acute phase protein that has been shown to play a role in experimental fibrosis caused by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) in mice . However , its role in more severe models of hepatic fibrosis ( e.g. , carbon tetrachloride ; CCl(4) ) has not been determined and is important for extrapolation to human disease . Wild-type or P05121 knockout mice were administered CCl(4) ( 1 ml/kg body wt ip ) 2x/wk for 4 wk . Plasma ( e.g. , transaminase activity ) and histological ( e.g. , Sirius red staining ) indexes of liver damage and fibrosis were evaluated . Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by P12004 and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining , respectively , as well as by indexes of cell cycle ( e.g. , p53 , cyclin D1 ) . In contrast to previous studies with BDL , hepatic fibrosis was enhanced in P05121 (-/-) mice after chronic CCl(4) administration . Indeed , all indexes of liver damage were elevated in P05121 (-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice . This enhanced liver damage correlated with impaired hepatocyte proliferation . A similar effect on proliferation was observed after one bolus dose of CCl(4) , without concomitant increases in liver damage . Under these conditions , a decrease in phospho-p38 , coupled with elevated p53 protein , was observed ; these results suggest impaired proliferation and a potential G(1)/S cell cycle arrest in P05121 (-/-) mice . These data suggest that P05121 may play multiple roles in chronic liver diseases , both protective and damaging , the latter mediated by its influence on inflammation and fibrosis and the former via helping maintain hepatocyte division after an injury .
