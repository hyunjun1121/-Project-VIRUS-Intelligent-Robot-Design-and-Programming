DB05229 sodium , a stable prostacyclin analogue , elicits dilation of isolated porcine retinal arterioles : roles of P29474 and potassium channels . PURPOSE : DB01240 ( DB01240 ) is usually described as an endoEDRFsthelium-derived relaxing factor , but the vasoreactivity to DB01240 in the retinal arterioles and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood . We examined the effects of DB01240 on the retinal microcirculation using beraprost sodium ( BPS ) , a stable DB01240 analogue , and the signaling mechanisms involved in this vasomotor activity . METHODS : Porcine retinal arterioles were isolated , cannulated , and pressurized without flow in vitro . Video microscopic techniques recorded the diametric responses to BPS . RESULTS : DB05229 sodium elicited dose-dependent ( 0.1 pM-0.1 Î¼M ) vasodilation of the retinal arterioles that was abolished by the P43119 ( IP ) antagonist CAY10441 . DB05229 sodium-induced vasodilation decreased by 50 % after the endothelium was removed and was inhibited by the nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) comparable with denudation . Inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase by 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one ( ODQ ) and blockage of protein kinase A ( PKA ) by Rp-8-Br-cAMPS were comparable to L-NAME . DB05229 sodium-induced vasodilation was also inhibited by the nonselective potassium channel inhibitor , tetraethylammonium , and the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium ( KATP ) channel blocker , glibenclamide . Residual vasodilation in the presence of glibenclamide decreased further with subsequent application of ODQ . CONCLUSIONS : DB05229 sodium , a stable DB01240 analogue , causes vasodilation of the retinal arterioles mediated via the IP receptor . The current findings suggest that BPS elicits endothelium-dependent and -independent dilation of the retinal arterioles mediated by NO induced by activation of PKA in the endothelium and the KATP channel activation in the vascular smooth muscle , respectively .
