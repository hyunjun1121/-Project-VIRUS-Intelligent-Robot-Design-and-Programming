Synthesis , biological evaluation and 3D-QSAR studies of novel 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole niacinamide derivatives as P15056 inhibitors . A series of novel 4,5-dihydropyrazole derivatives containing niacinamide moiety as potential V600E mutant P15056 kinase ( P15056 (V600E) ) inhibitors were designed and synthesized . Results of the bioassays against P15056 (V600E) and WM266.4 human melanoma cell line showed several compounds to be endowed potent activities with IC(50) and GI(50) value in low micromolar range , among which compound 27e , (5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)6-methylpyridin-3-yl methanone ( IC(50)=0.20 μM , GI(50)=0.89 μM ) was bearing the best bioactivity comparable with the positive control DB00398 . Docking simulation was performed to determine the probable binding model and 3D-QSAR model was built to provide more pharmacophore understanding that could use to design new agents with more potent P15056 (V600E) inhibitory activity .
