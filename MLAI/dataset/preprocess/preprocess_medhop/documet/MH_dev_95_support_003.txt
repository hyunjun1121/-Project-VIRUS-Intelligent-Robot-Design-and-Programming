Matrix metalloproteinases are differentially expressed in adipose tissue during obesity and modulate adipocyte differentiation . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are essential for proper extracellular matrix remodeling , a process that takes place during obesity-mediated adipose tissue formation . Here , we examine expression profiles and the potential role of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors ( TIMPs ) in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity . Expression patterns are studied by Northern blot and real-time PCR in two genetic models of obesity ( ob/ob and db/db mice ) and in a diet-induced model of obesity ( AKR mice ) . Of the MMPs and TIMPs studied , mRNA levels for P08253 , P08254 , P39900 , P50281 , Q99542 , and P01033 are strongly induced in obese adipose tissues compared with lean tissues . In contrast , P09237 and P35625 mRNAs are markedly decreased in obesity . Interestingly , enzymatic activities of P39900 and of a new identified adipocyte-derived 30-kDa metalloproteinase are enhanced in obese adipose tissue fractions , demonstrating that MMP/ P01033 balance is shifted toward increased matrix degradation in obesity . Finally , we analyze the modulation of P08253 , Q99542 , and P01033 during 3T3- Q9NUQ9 preadipocyte differentiation , and we explore the effect of inhibition of MMP activity on in vitro adipogenesis . We find that the synthetic MMP inhibitor BB-94 ( DB03880 ) decreases adipose conversion of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 and primary rat preadipocytes . BB-94 represses differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion but prevents the early expression of P17676 , a transcription factor that is thought to play a major role in the adipogenic program . Such findings support a role for the MMP/ P01033 system in the control of proteolytic events and adipogenesis during obesity-mediated fat mass development .
