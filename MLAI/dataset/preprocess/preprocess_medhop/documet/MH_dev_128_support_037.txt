Role of P30532 -A3 genetic Locus variants and developing drug for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for P48444 and P48444 severity . In turn P48444 is a major independent risk factor for lung cancer . Genome-wide association ( GWA ) studies both in lung cancer and P48444 highlighted the same variants ( SNPs ) on chromosome 15q25 marking the gene cluster P32297 - P30926 - P30532 for these smoking related diseases , showing a stimulating connection between this common genetic region and smoking behavior and smoking related illnesses . Different authors identified two candidate regions associated with age at smoking initiation in patients with P48444 . The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism ( rs1051730 ) on chromosome 15q25 is associated with major tobacco-related diseases in the general population with additional increased risk of P48444 as well as lung cancer . Moreover variants on the gene cluster P32297 - P30926 - P30532 are associated with nicotine addiction antismoking therapy and antismoking therapy side-effects . These findings not only support the notion that variants can influence any therapy for smoking cessation , but offer rational bases to develop new drugs and new therapeutic strategies .
