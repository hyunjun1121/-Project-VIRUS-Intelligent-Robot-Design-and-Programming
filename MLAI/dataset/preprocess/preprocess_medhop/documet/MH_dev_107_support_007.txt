Non-human primate models of alcohol-related phenotypes : the influence of genetic and environmental factors . Because of their complex social structures , behaviors , and genetic similarities to humans , nonhuman primates are useful for studying how genetic factors influence alcohol consumption . The neurobiological systems that influence addiction vulnerability may do so by acting on alcohol response , reward pathways , behavioral dyscontrol , and vulnerability to stress and anxiety . Rhesus macaques show individual differences in alcohol response and temperament , and such differences are influenced by genetic variants that are similar functionally to those present in humans . Genes at which variation moderates these phenotypes include those encoding monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 -LPR ) , the serotonin transporter ( HTTLPR ) , corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 -248C/T and -2232 C/G ) , Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 -1002 T/G ) , and the Î¼-opioid receptor ( P35372 C77G ) . These provide opportunities for modeling how genetic and environmental factors ( i.e. , stress , individual 's sex , or alcohol exposure ) interact to influence alcohol consumption . Studies in primates may also reveal selective factors have driven maintenance or fixation of alleles that increase risk for alcohol use disorders in modern humans .
