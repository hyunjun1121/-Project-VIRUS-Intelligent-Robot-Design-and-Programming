P29466 and caspase-8 cleave and inactivate cellular parkin . Lesions in the parkin gene cause early onset Parkinson 's disease by a loss of dopaminergic neurons , thus demonstrating a vital role for parkin in the survival of these neurons . O60260 is inactivated by caspase cleavage , and the major cleavage site is after Asp126 . Caspases responsible for parkin cleavage were identified by several experimental paradigms . Transient coexpression of caspases and wild type parkin in P29320 -293 cells identified caspase-1 , -3 , and -8 as efficient inducers of parkin cleavage whereas caspase-2 , -7 , -9 , and -11 did not induce cleavage . A D126A parkin mutation abrogates cleavage induced by caspase-1 and -8 , but not by caspase-3 . In anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells , parkin cleavage was inhibited by caspase inhibitors hFlip and CrmA ( but not by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis ( P98170 ) ) , indicating that caspase-8 ( but not caspase-3 ) is responsible for the parkin cleavage in this model . Moreover , induction of apoptosis in caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cells , either by caspase-1 or -8 overexpression or by tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment , led to parkin cleavage . These results demonstrate that caspase-1 and -8 can directly cleave parkin and suggest that death receptor activation and inflammatory stress can cause loss of the ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin , thus causing accumulation of toxic parkin substrates and triggering dopaminergic cell death .
