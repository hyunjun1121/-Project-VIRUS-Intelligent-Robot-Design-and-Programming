Characterization of aberrant melting peaks in unlabeled probe assays . An unlabeled probe assay relies on a double-stranded DNA-binding dye to detect and verify target based on amplicon and probe melting . During the development and application of unlabeled probe assays , aberrant melting peaks are sometimes observed that may interfere with assay interpretation . In this report , we investigated the origin of aberrant melting profiles observed in an unlabeled probe assay for exon 10 of the P07949 gene . It was determined that incomplete 3' blocking of the unlabeled probe allowed polymerase-mediated probe extension resulting in extension products that generated the aberrant melting profiles . This report further examined the blocking ability of the 3' modifications P01024 spacer , amino-modified P13671 , phosphate , inverted dT , and single 3' nucleotide mismatches in unlabeled probe experiments . Although no 3' blocking modifications in these experiments were 100 % effective , the amino-modified P13671 , inverted dT , and P01024 spacer provided the best blocking efficiencies ( 1 % or less unblocked ) , phosphate was not as effective of a block ( up to 2 % unblocked ) , and single nucleotide mismatches should be avoided as a 3' blocking modification .
