N6-isopentenyladenosine , an endogenous isoprenoid end product , directly affects cytotoxic and regulatory functions of human NK cells through P14324 modulation . iPA is a naturally occurring nucleoside with an isopentenyl moiety derived from the mevalonate pathway and a well-established anti-tumor activity . In analogy to the unique specificity for phosphoantigens , such as IPP , shown by human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells , here , we report for the first time the ability of iPA to selectively expand and directly target human NK cells . Interestingly , submicromolar doses of iPA stimulate resting human NK cells and synergize with P60568 to induce a robust activation ex vivo with significant secretion of P13501 and P10147 and a large increase in P01375 -α and IFN-γ production when compared with P60568 single cytokine treatment . Moreover , iPA promotes NK cell proliferation and up-regulates the expression of specific NK cell-activating receptors , as well as Q07108 and CD107a expression . Accordingly , this phenotype correlates with significantly greater cytotoxicity against tumor targets . At the molecular level , iPA leads to a selective , potent activation of MAPK signaling intermediaries downstream of the IL-2R . The effect results , at least in part , from the fine modulation of the P14324 activity , the same enzyme implicated in the stimulation of the human γδ T cells . The iPA-driven modulation of P14324 can cause an enhancement of post-translational prenylation essential for the biological activity of key proteins in NK signaling and effector functions , such as Ras . These unanticipated properties of iPA provide an additional piece of evidence of the immunoregulatory role of the intermediates of the mevalonate pathway and open novel therapeutic perspectives for this molecule as an immune-modulatory drug .
