Expression of P20839 and P12268 after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression . BACKGROUND : DB01024 ( DB00603 ) mediates immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . Induction of IMPDH activity has been observed in whole blood and erythrocyte samples during immunosuppressive therapy . Information concerning the mechanisms for increased IMPDH activity is limited and the potential implications of induction have been debated . METHODS : Whole blood , P01730 + cell , and reticulocyte samples were collected from 30 renal transplant patients pre- and posttransplantation . The expressions of two IMPDH isoforms , type 1 and 2 , were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantified using a housekeeping gene index . The IMPDH activity was determined by ultraviolet high-performance liquid chromatography . RESULTS : Transplantation and the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy was associated with increased P20839 ( 50-88 % , P < 0.0005 ) and decreased P12268 ( 42-56 % , P < 0.0005 ) expression . In P01730 + cells , however , P12268 increased ( 15 % , P=0.009 ) . These changes are probably related to glucocorticoid effects . Two weeks posttransplant , DB00603 -treated patients displayed elevated P20839 and 2 in reticulocytes , suggesting enzyme induction in these cells during prolonged DB00603 therapy . Patients with acute rejection during follow-up demonstrated higher P12268 expression in P01730 + cells pretransplant than nonrejecting patients ( median expression 1.26 vs. 0.87 respectively , P=0.017 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Knowledge of changes in P20839 and 2 expression after transplantation and initiation of immunosuppression is important considering the action of DB00603 on IMPDH and the potential for pharmacodynamic monitoring of DB00603 by measuring IMPDH activity . The expression of P12268 in P01730 + cells pretransplant may be an indicator of immune activation .
