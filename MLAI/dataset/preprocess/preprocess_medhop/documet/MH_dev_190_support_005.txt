Nanostructured lipid carriers as multifunctional nanomedicine platform for pulmonary co-delivery of anticancer drugs and siRNA . We developed , synthesized , and tested a multifunctional nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system ( NLCS ) for efficient delivery of an anticancer drug and siRNA directly into the lungs by inhalation . The system contains : ( 1 ) nanostructured lipid carriers ( NLC ) ; ( 2 ) anticancer drug ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) ; ( 3 ) siRNA targeted to MRP1 mRNA as a suppressor of pump drug resistance ; ( 4 ) siRNA targeted to P10415 mRNA as a suppressor of nonpump cellular resistance and ( 5 ) a modified synthetic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) as a targeting moiety specific to the receptors that are overexpressed in the plasma membrane of lung cancer cells . The NLCS was tested in vitro using human lung cancer cells and in vivo utilizing mouse orthotopic model of human lung cancer . After inhalation , the proposed NLCS effectively delivered its payload into lung cancer cells leaving healthy lung tissues intact and also significantly decreasing the exposure of healthy organs when compared with intravenous injection . The NLCS showed enhanced antitumor activity when compared with intravenous treatment . The data obtained demonstrated high efficiency of proposed NLCS for tumor-targeted local delivery by inhalation of anticancer drugs and mixture of siRNAs specifically to lung cancer cells and , as a result , efficient suppression of tumor growth and prevention of adverse side effects on healthy organs .
