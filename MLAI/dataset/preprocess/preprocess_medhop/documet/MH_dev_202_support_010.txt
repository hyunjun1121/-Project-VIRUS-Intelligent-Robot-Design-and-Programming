A cell-based luciferase-dependent assay for the quantitative determination of free extracellular adenosine with paracrine signaling activity . Extracellular adenosine exerts powerful paracrine effects on immune cells . Thus , adenosine signaling has to be strictly regulated . This is achieved by its rapid internalization or enzymatic degradation . Consequently , free adenosine is extremely difficult to measure in cell culture systems and may escape from detection by time-consuming endpoint measurements like high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Therefore , we have now developed a highly sensitive assay which enables the quantification of biologically relevant extracellular adenosine via the activation of an ectopically expressed DB00640 2a-receptor ( P29274 ) in P29320 -293 reporter cells . Binding of the short-lived nucleoside to this receptor induces a DB02527 -dependent signal which can be detected via a DB02527 -responsive luciferase construct . Tests with exogenously added adenosine confirmed that the resulting luminescence signals correlate with the respective adenosine levels and thus allow quantitative measurements in a range from 20 nM to 80 Î¼M free extracellular adenosine . Inhibition of adenosine uptake by dipyridamole further increased the sensitivity of the assay . We further validated our approach by quantifying the adenosine levels that are generated by regulatory T cells via ectonucleotidase-mediated cleavage of DB00171 . As expected , values returned to baseline when P29274 was inhibited . This confirmed that this new cell-based reporter assay constitutes a biologically relevant , technically easy , versatile , scalable and cost-effective approach that allows the non-radioactive quantification of adenosine as a signaling intermediate .
