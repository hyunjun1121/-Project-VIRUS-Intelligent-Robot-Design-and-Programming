DB00624 potentiates the hypoxic ventilatory response of adult male rats subjected to neonatal stress . Neonatal stress disrupts development of homeostatic systems . During adulthood , male rats subjected to neonatal maternal separation ( Q5H8A3 ) are hypertensive and show a larger hypoxic ventilatory response ( HVR ) , with greater respiratory instability during sleep . Neonatal stress also affects sex hormone secretion ; hypoxia increases circulating testosterone of Q5H8A3 ( but not control ) male rats . Given that these effects of Q5H8A3 are not observed in females , we tested the hypothesis that testosterone elevation is necessary for the stress-related increase of the HVR in adult male rats . Pups subjected to Q5H8A3 were placed in an incubator for 3 h per day from postnatal day 3 to 12 . Control pups remained undisturbed . Rats were reared until adulthood , and the HVR was measured by plethysmography ( fractional inspired O2 = 0.12 , for 20 min ) . We used gonadectomy to evaluate the effects of reducing testosterone on the HVR . Gonadectomy had no effect on the HVR of control animals but reduced that of Q5H8A3 animals below control levels . Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify androgen receptors in brainstem areas involved in the HVR . P10275 expression was generally greater in Q5H8A3 rats than in control rats ; the most significant increase was noted in the caudal region of the nucleus tractus solitarii . We conclude that the abnormal regulation of testosterone is important in stress-related augmentation of the HVR . The greater number of androgen receptors within the brainstem may explain why Q5H8A3 rats are more sensitive to testosterone withdrawal . Based on the similarities of the cardiorespiratory phenotype of Q5H8A3 rats and patients suffering from sleep-disordered breathing , these results provide new insight into its pathophysiology , especially sex-based differences in its prevalence .
