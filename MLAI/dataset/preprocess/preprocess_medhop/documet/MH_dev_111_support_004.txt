Class I histone deacetylase activity is required for proliferation of renal epithelial cells . The process of renal regeneration after acute kidney injury is thought to recapitulate renal development , and proliferation of renal proximal tubular cells ( RPTCs ) is a critical step in the regenerative response . Recent studies indicate that class I histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are required for embryonic kidney gene expression , growth , and differentiation . The role and underlying mechanisms of class I HDAC activation in RPTC proliferation , however , remain unclear . In this study , we used cultured RPTCs to examine this issue since four class I HDAC isoforms ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 ) are abundantly expressed in this cell type . Blocking class I HDAC activity with a highly selective inhibitor , MS-275 , induced global histone H3 hyperacetylation , reduced RPTC proliferation , and diminished expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen . Silencing Q13547 , 3 , or 8 with small interfering RNA resulted in similar biological effects . Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) was required for RPTC proliferation , and P40763 functioned downstream of P00533 . Treatment with MS-275 or knockdown of Q13547 , 3 , or 8 suppressed P00533 expression and phosphorylation , and silencing Q13547 and 3 also reduced P40763 phosphorylation . However , Q92769 downregulation did not affect RPTC proliferation and phosphorylation of P00533 and P40763 . Collectively , these data reveal a critical role of class I HDACs in mediating proliferation of renal epithelial cells through activation of the P00533 / P40763 signaling pathway .
