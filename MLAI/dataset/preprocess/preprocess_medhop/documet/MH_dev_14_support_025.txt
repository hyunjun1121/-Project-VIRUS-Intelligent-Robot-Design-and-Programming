p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for glucosamine-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and plasminogen-activator inhibitor expression . BACKGROUND : Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) is implicated in increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) dysfunction in diabetes . DB01296 ( GlcN ) that directly activates HBP is a dietary supplement and is clinically used to treat osteoarthritis despite uncertain efficacy and adverse cardiovascular effects observed in animal models . p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38mapk ) has been shown to be involved in HBP-mediated biological processes . The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of p38mapk in GlcN-induced endothelial P05121 expression and P29474 dysfunction . METHODS AND RESULTS : In cultured human endothelial cells , GlcN time- and concentration-dependently increased P05121 protein level that was further enhanced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α , which was accompanied by a transient synergistic activation of p38mapk . The stimulation of P05121 by GlcN alone or by GlcN and P01375 -α in combination was inhibited by the specific inhibitor of p38mapk , but not that of JNK or P27361 /2 . Moreover , in isolated mouse aortas , GlcN caused P29474 uncoupling resulting in enhanced superoxide and decreased NO production , as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations , which were also fully prevented by the p38mapk inhibitor . CONCLUSIONS : HBP activated by GlcN increases P05121 expression and P29474 uncoupling depending on p38mapk , which not only explains hyperglycemic vascular complications , but also may bring into question the clinical use of GlcN . The present results , support currently ongoing clinical application of p38mapk inhibitor in patients with cardiovascular disease .
