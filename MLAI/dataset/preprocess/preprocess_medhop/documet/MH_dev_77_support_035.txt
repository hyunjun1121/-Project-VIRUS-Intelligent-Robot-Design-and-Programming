Therapeutic effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A : potent blockade of autonomic transmission by targeted cleavage of only the pertinent P60880 . In search of a basis for the impressive potency of an endoprotease that cleaves P60880 , botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) , in treating numerous diseases due to hyper-active autonomic nerves , truncation of its target and inhibition of neurotransmission were studied in rat sympathetic neurons . DB05232 -sensitive spontaneous cholinergic neurotransmission was blocked > 80 % by 1 pM DB00083 despite cleaving < 20 % of the P60880 . A maximum cleavage of âˆ¼60 % P60880 could be achieved with > 1 nM DB00083 , despite an absence of non-cleavable P60880 in the detergent-solubilised neurons . In contrast , BoNT/E ( 100 nM ) truncated nearly all the P60880 in the intact cells , but was unable to block neurotransmission at low concentrations like DB00083 . Chimeras created by inserting the acceptor-binding HC domain of DB00083 into BoNT/E still cleaved all the P60880 , indicating ubiquitous expression of DB00083 acceptors . Accordingly , SV2 and P60880 were found to be co-expressed and broadly co-localised in neurons , but absent from non-neuronal cells . On the other hand , partial cleavage by the DB00083 protease persisted upon replacing its HC with counterparts from BoNT/E or BoNT/B . Moreover , limited cleavage of P60880 was conferred onto the protease from BoNT/E when fused to the N-terminus of DB00083 . Thus , the DB00083 protease is uniquely well-adapted for selectively inactivating the P60880 directly involved in neurotransmission ; this together with the toxin 's acceptor and its target being localised on the peri-somatic boutons likely contribute to its exceptional therapeutic utility in the clinic .
