Q13639 receptor agonists increase sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus of male C57BL/6j mice . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : A strategy to treat Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is to increase the soluble form of amyloid precursor protein ( sAPPalpha ) , a promnesic protein , in the brain . Because strong evidence supports beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(4) receptor agonists in memory and learning , we investigated the role of 5-HT(4) receptors on P05067 processing in 8 weeks-old male C57BL/6j mice . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Mice were given , subcutaneously , prucalopride or ML 10302 ( s.c. ) , two highly selective 5-HT(4) receptor agonists and , up to 240 min later , the hippocampus and cortex were analysed by Western blot for sAPPalpha determination . KEY RESULTS : DB06480 ( 5 or 10 mg kg(-1) ) significantly increased sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus and cortex , but did not modify the expression level of P05067 mRNA as detected by quantitative RT-PCR . A selective 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist , GR125487 ( 1 mg kg(-1) , s.c. ) inhibited prucalopride induced- increase in sAPPalpha levels . In addition , levels of sAPPalpha were increased by ML10302 only at 20 mg kg(-1) and was limited to the cortex . Also , prucalopride increased sAPPalpha levels in the cortex of a transgenic mouse model of AD , expressing the London mutation of P05067 . Furthermore , the combined injection of a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , donepezil and prucalopride induced a synergic increase in sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Our results demonstrate that the 5-HT(4) receptor plays a key role in the non-amyloidogenic pathway of P05067 metabolism in vivo and give support to the beneficial use of 5-HT(4) agonists for AD treatment .
