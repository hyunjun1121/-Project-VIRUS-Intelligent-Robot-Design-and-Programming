Pharmacogenetic pathway analysis of irinotecan . DB00762 , a chemotherapeutic agent against various solid tumors , is a prodrug requiring activation to SN-38 . DB00762 's complex pharmacokinetics potentially allow for many genetic sources of variability . We explored relationships between pharmacokinetic pathways and polymorphisms in genes associated with irinotecan 's metabolism and transport . We fitted a seven-compartment pharmacokinetic model with enterohepatic recirculation ( EHR ) to concentrations of irinotecan and metabolites SN-38 , SN-38 glucuronide ( SN-38G ) , and aminopentanoic acid ( P25054 ) . Principal component analysis ( DB11245 ) of patient-specific parameter estimates produced measures interpretable along pathways . Nine principal components provided good characterization of the overall variation . Polymorphisms in genes P22309 , Q9HAW7 , and O60656 had strong associations with a component corresponding to the irinotecan-to-SN-38 pathway and SN-38 recirculation and to a component relating to SN-38-to-SN-38G conversion and elimination of SN-38G . The component characterizing irinotecan 's compartments was associated with HNF1alpha and Q92887 polymorphisms . The exploratory analysis with DB11245 in this pharmacogenetic analysis was able to identify known associations and may have allowed identification of previously uncharacterized functional polymorphisms .
