Identification of antithrombin-modulating genes . Role of O95461 , a gene encoding a bifunctional glycosyltransferase , in the secretion of proteins ? The haemostatic relevance of antithrombin together with the low genetic variability of P01008 , and the high heritability of plasma levels encourage the search for modulating genes . We used a hypothesis-free approach to identify these genes , evaluating associations between plasma antithrombin and 307,984 polymorphisms in the GAIT study ( 352 individuals from 21 Spanish families ) . Despite no SNP reaching the genome wide significance threshold , we verified milder positive associations in 307 blood donors from a different cohort . This validation study suggested O95461 , a gene encoding a protein with xylosyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase activities that forms heparin-like linear polysaccharides , as a potential modulator of antithrombin based on the significant association of one SNPs , rs762057 , with anti-FXa activity , particularly after adjustment for age , sex and P01008 rs2227589 genotype , all factors influencing antithrombin levels ( p = 0.02 ) . Additional results sustained this association . O95461 silencing inHepG2 and P29320 -EBNA cells did not affect P01008 mRNA levels but significantly reduced the secretion of antithrombin with moderate intracellular retention . Milder effects were observed on Î±1-antitrypsin , prothrombin and transferrin . Our study suggests O95461 as the first known modifier of plasma antithrombin , and proposes a new role for O95461 in modulating extracellular secretion of certain glycoproteins .
