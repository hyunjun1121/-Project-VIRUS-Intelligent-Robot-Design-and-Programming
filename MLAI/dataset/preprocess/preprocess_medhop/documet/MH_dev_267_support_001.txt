Counteraction between angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) via activating angiotensin type I and Mas receptor on rat renal mesangial cells . In the updated concept of renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , it contains the angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) -angiotensin ( Ang ) II-angtiogensin type 1 receptor ( AT1 ) axis and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase ( Q9BYF1 ) -Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis . The former axis has been well demonstrated performing the vasoconstrictive , proliferative and pro-inflammatory functions by activation of AT1 receptors , while the later new identified axis is considered counterbalancing the effects of the former . The present study is aimed at observing the interaction between Ang-(1-7) and Ang II on cultured rat renal mesangial cells ( MCs ) . RT-PCR , Western blot and immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy results showed that both AT1 and Mas receptor were co-distributed in rat renal MCs . Ang-(1-7) showed similar effects on Ang II in cultured MCs that stimulated phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 phosphorylation and transforms growth factor-Î²1 synthesis , and cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis . Co-treatment of the cell with Ang-(1-7) and Ang II , Ang-(1-7) counteracted AngII-induced effects in a concentration dependent manner , but failed to alter the changes induced by endothelin-1 . The stimulating effect of Ang II was mediated by AT1 receptor while all the effects of Ang-(1-7) were blocked by Mas receptor antagonist A-779 , but not by AT1 receptor antagonist losartan or P50052 receptor antagonist PD123319 . These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) and Ang II specifically interact with each other on rat renal MCs via activation of their specific receptors , Mas and AT1 receptor respectively .
