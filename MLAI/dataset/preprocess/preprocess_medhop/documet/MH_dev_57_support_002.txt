Bile acids activate fibroblast growth factor 19 signaling in human hepatocytes to inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene expression . Mouse fibroblast growth factor 15 ( FGF15 ) and human ortholog O95750 have been identified as the bile acid-induced intestinal factors that mediate bile acid feedback inhibition of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene ( C YP7A1 ) transcription in mouse liver . The mechanism underlying FGF15/ O95750 inhibition of bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes remains unclear . Chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) and the farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) -specific agonist GW4064 strongly induced O95750 but inhibited P22680 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels in primary human hepatocytes . O95750 strongly and rapidly repressed P22680 but not small heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) mRNA levels . Kinase inhibition and phosphorylation assays revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( MAPK/Erk1/2 ) pathway played a major role in mediating O95750 inhibition of P22680 . However , small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) knockdown of Q15466 did not affect O95750 inhibition of P22680 . Interestingly , DB06777 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGF receptor 4 ( P22455 ) in hepatocytes . O95750 antibody and siRNA specific to P22455 abrogated GW4064 inhibition of P22680 . These results suggest that bile acid-activated Q96RI1 is able to induce O95750 in hepatocytes to inhibit P22680 by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism . CONCLUSION : The hepatic O95750 / P22455 /Erk1/2 pathway may inhibit P22680 independent of Q15466 . In addition to inducing O95750 in the intestine , bile acids in hepatocytes may activate the liver O95750 / P22455 signaling pathway to inhibit bile acid synthesis and prevent accumulation of toxic bile acid in human livers .
