Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy response requires janus kinase 2-histone deacetylase 2 signaling . Pressure overload induces cardiac hypertrophy through activation of O60674 ( Jak2 ) , however , the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown . In the current study , we tested whether histone deacetylase 2 ( Q92769 ) was involved in the process . We found that angiotensin II ( Ang-II ) -induced re-expression of fetal genes ( Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) ) in cultured cardiomyocytes was prevented by the Jak2 inhibitor AG-490 and Q92769 inhibitor Trichostatin-A ( P32119 ) , or by Jak2/ Q92769 siRNA knockdown . On the other hand , myocardial cells with Jak2 or Q92769 over-expression were hyper-sensitive to Ang-II . In vivo , pressure overload by transverse aorta binding ( AB ) induced a significant cardiac hypertrophic response as well as re-expression of P01160 and DB04899 in mice heart , which were markedly reduced by AG-490 and P32119 . Significantly , AG-490 , the Jak2 inhibitor , largely suppressed pressure overload-/Ang-II-induced Q92769 nuclear exportation in vivo and in vitro . Meanwhile , P32119 or Q92769 siRNA knockdown reduced Ang-II-induced P01160 / DB04899 expression in Jak2 over-expressed H9c2 cardiomyocytes . Together , these results suggest that Q92769 might be a downstream effector of Jak2 to mediate cardiac hypertrophic response by pressure overload or Ang-II .
