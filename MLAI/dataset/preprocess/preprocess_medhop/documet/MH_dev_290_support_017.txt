Recent advances in the genetics of schizophrenia . The genetic etiology of schizophrenia , a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder , is supported by a wealth of data . Review of the current findings suggests that considerable progress has been made in recent years , with a number of chromosomal regions consistently implicated by linkage analysis . Three groups have shown linkage to 1q21-22 using similar models , with HLOD scores of 6.5 , 3.2 , and 2.4 . Other replicated loci include 13q32 that has been implicated by two independent groups with significant HLOD scores ( 4.42 ) or Q9BXD5 values ( 4.18 ) , and 5pl4.1-13.1 , 5q21-33 , 8p2l-22 , and 10p11-15 , each of which have been reported as suggestive by at least three separate groups . Different studies have also replicated evidence for a modest number of candidate genes that were not ascertained through linkage . Of these , the greatest support exists for the P35462 ( 3q13.3 ) , P28223 ( 13q14.2 ) , and P36544 ( 15q13-q14 ) genes . The refinement of phenotypes , the use of endophenotypes , reduction of heterogeneity , and extensive genetic mapping have all contributed to this progress . The rapid expansion of information from the human genome project will likely further accelerate this progress and assist in the discovery of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia . A greater understanding of disease mechanisms and the application of pharmacogenetics should also lead to improvements in therapeutic interventions .
