Genetic polymorphisms in the oxidative stress pathway and susceptibility to non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and other free radicals is involved in a number of pathological conditions including cancer . In a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( Q9NZ71 ) ( n = 518 cases , 597 controls ) among women in Connecticut , we analyzed one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in ten candidate genes ( P14550 , Q04828 , P42330 , P13498 , P07203 , P05164 , P35228 , NOS3 , O15527 , and P04179 ) that mediate oxidative stress directly or indirectly in the NADPH oxidase-dependent respiratory burst . Odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were adjusted for age and race . Polymorphisms in P14550 and P13498 were significantly associated with increased risk of Q9NZ71 . There was a 1.7-fold ( 95 % CI = 1.2-2.4 , P = 0.0047 ) increased risk of Q9NZ71 for individuals who were variant homozygous for the P14550 ( IVS5 + 282T > C ) SNP . The effect was most pronounced for risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , but risk estimates were non-significantly elevated for other common B-cell histologies and T-cell lymphomas as well . In addition , individuals variant homozygous for the P13498 ( Ex4 + 11C > T ) SNP had a 1.6-fold ( 95 % CI = 1.1-2.4 , P = 0.019 ) increased risk of Q9NZ71 that was particularly pronounced for T-cell lymphoma ( OR = 3.5 , 95 % CI = 1.3-9.6 , P = 0.013 ) , but was also associated with non-significant increased risks for each of the common B-cell histologies . These results suggest that SNPs in genes related to the oxidative stress pathway may be associated with increased risk of Q9NZ71 .
