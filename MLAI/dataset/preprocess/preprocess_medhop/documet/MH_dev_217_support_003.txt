Muscle KATP channels : recent insights to energy sensing and myoprotection . DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels are present in the surface and internal membranes of cardiac , skeletal , and smooth muscle cells and provide a unique feedback between muscle cell metabolism and electrical activity . In so doing , they can play an important role in the control of contractility , particularly when cellular energetics are compromised , protecting the tissue against calcium overload and fiber damage , but the cost of this protection may be enhanced arrhythmic activity . Generated as complexes of Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 pore-forming subunits with regulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits , Q09428 or SUR2 , the differential assembly of K( DB00171 ) channels in different tissues gives rise to tissue-specific physiological and pharmacological regulation , and hence to the tissue-specific pharmacological control of contractility . The last 10 years have provided insights into the regulation and role of muscle K( DB00171 ) channels , in large part driven by studies of mice in which the protein determinants of channel activity have been deleted or modified . As yet , few human diseases have been correlated with altered muscle K( DB00171 ) activity , but genetically modified animals give important insights to likely pathological roles of aberrant channel activity in different muscle types .
