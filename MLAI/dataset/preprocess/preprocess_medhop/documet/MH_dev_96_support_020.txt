Evaluation of the endogenous cannabinoid system in mediating the behavioral effects of dipyrone ( metamizol ) in mice . DB04817 is a common nonopioid analgesic and antipyretic , which , in many countries , is available over the counter and is more widely used than paracetamol or aspirin . However , the exact mechanisms by which dipyrone acts remain inconclusive . Two novel arachidonoyl-conjugated metabolites are formed in mice following the administration of dipyrone that are dependent on the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) , which also represents the major catabolic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid ligand anandamide . These arachidonoyl metabolites not only inhibit cyclooxygenase ( P23219 / P35354 ) but also bind to cannabinoid receptors at low micromolar concentrations . The relative contributions of cannabinoid receptors and FAAH in the overall behavioral response to dipyrone remain untested . Accordingly , the two primary objectives of the present study were to determine whether the behavioral effects of dipyrone would ( a ) be blocked by cannabinoid receptor antagonists and ( b ) occur in FAAH mice . Here , we report that thermal antinociceptive , hypothermic , and locomotor suppressive actions of dipyrone are mediated by a noncannabinoid receptor mechanism of action and occurred after acute or repeated administration irrespective of FAAH . These findings indicate that FAAH-dependent arachidonoyl metabolites and cannabinoid receptors are not requisites by which dipyrone exerts these pharmacological effects under noninflammatory conditions .
