Microglial activation , increased P01375 and P31645 expression in the prefrontal cortex define stress-altered behaviour in mice susceptible to anhedonia . A chronic stress paradigm comprising exposure to predation , tail suspension and restraint induces a depressive syndrome in C57BL/6J mice that occurs in some , but not all , animals . Here , we sought to extend our behavioural studies to investigate how susceptibility ( sucrose preference < 65 % ) or resilience ( sucrose preference > 65 % ) to stress-induced anhedonia affects the 5HT system and the expression of inflammation-related genes . All chronically stressed animals , displayed increased level of anxiety , but susceptible mice exhibited an increased propensity to float in the forced swim test and demonstrate hyperactivity under stressful lighting conditions . These changes were not present in resilient or acutely stressed animals . Compared to resilient animals , susceptible mice showed elevated expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) and the 5-HT transporter ( P31645 ) in the pre-frontal area . Enhanced expression of 5HT(2A) and P23219 in the pre-frontal area was observed in all stressed animals . In turn , indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase ( P14902 ) was significantly unregulated in the raphe of susceptible animals . At the cellular level , increased numbers of Iba-1-positive microglial cells were also present in the prefrontal area of susceptible animals compared to resilient animals . Consequently , the susceptible animals display a unique molecular profile when compared to resilient , but anxious , animals . Unexpectedly , this altered profile provides a rationale for exploring anti-inflammatory , and possibly , P01375 -targeted therapy for major depression .
