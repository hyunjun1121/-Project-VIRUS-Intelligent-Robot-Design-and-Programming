DB00169 and its nuclear receptor increase the expression and activity of the human proton-coupled folate transporter . Folates are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and are particularly required in rapidly proliferating tissues , such as intestinal epithelium and hemopoietic cells . Availability of dietary folates is determined by their absorption across the intestinal epithelium , mediated by the proton-coupled folate transporter ( Q96NT5 ) at the apical enterocyte membranes . Whereas transport properties of Q96NT5 are well characterized , regulation of Q96NT5 gene expression remains less elucidated . We have studied the mechanisms that regulate Q96NT5 promoter activity and expression in intestine-derived cells . Q96NT5 mRNA levels are increased in Caco-2 cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( vitamin D(3) ) in a dose-dependent fashion , and the duodenal rat Pcft mRNA expression is induced by vitamin D(3) ex vivo . The Q96NT5 promoter region is transactivated by the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor-alpha ( RXRalpha ) in the presence of vitamin D(3) . In silico analyses predicted a P11473 response element ( VDRE ) in the Q96NT5 promoter region -1694/-1680 . DNA binding assays showed direct and specific binding of the P11473 :RXRalpha heterodimer to the Q96NT5 (-1694/-1680) , and chromatin immunoprecipitations verified that this interaction occurs within living cells . Mutational promoter analyses confirmed that the Q96NT5 (-1694/-1680) motif mediates a transcriptional response to vitamin D(3) . In functional support of this regulatory mechanism , treatment with vitamin D(3) significantly increased the uptake of [(3)H]folic acid into Caco-2 cells at pH 5.5 . In conclusion , vitamin D(3) and P11473 increase intestinal Q96NT5 expression , resulting in enhanced cellular folate uptake . Pharmacological treatment of patients with vitamin D(3) may have the added therapeutic benefit of enhancing the intestinal absorption of folates .
