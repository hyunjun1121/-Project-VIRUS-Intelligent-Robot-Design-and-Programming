Surfactin exhibits neuroprotective effects by inhibiting amyloid β-mediated microglial activation . Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer 's disease ; therefore , control of microglial activation and subsequent suppression of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory molecules could provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of such diseases . In this study , we investigated the effects of surfactin , a surfactant from Bacillus subtilis , on oligomeric amyloid β ( Aβ ) -induced microglial activation and neurotoxicity . Surfactin significantly suppressed expression of P14780 , P35228 and P35354 , as well as production of ROS , NO , DB00917 , P01375 -α , IL-1β , P05231 and P13500 in Aβ-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells . Moreover , surfactin markedly inhibited Aβ-induced nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB as well as phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK . Furthermore , surfactin protected hippocampal HT22 cells from indirect neuronal toxicity mediated by Aβ-treated microglial cells , but had no effect on Aβ-induced direct toxicity to HT22 cells . These results suggest that surfactin impairs the Aβ-induced inflammatory response of microglial cells and confers protection against indirect neurotoxicity to hippocampal cells . Our findings indicate that surfactin may have therapeutic potential for ameliorating Alzheimer 's disease as well as other neurodegenerative disorders which involve neuroinflammation .
