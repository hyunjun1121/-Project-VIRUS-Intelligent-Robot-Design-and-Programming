Engineering human T cells for resistance to methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil as an in vivo cell selection strategy . Gene transfer and drug selection systems that enforce ongoing transgene expression in vitro and in vivo which are compatible with human pharmaceutical drugs are currently underdeveloped . Here , we report on the utility of incorporating human enzyme muteins that confer resistance to the lymphotoxic/immunosuppressive drugs methotrexate ( MTX ) and mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ) in a multicistronic lentiviral vector for in vivo T lymphocyte selection . We found that co-expression of human dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 (FS) ; L22F , F31S ) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase II ( P12268 (IY) ; T333I , S351Y ) conferred T cell resistance to the cytocidal and anti-proliferative effects of these drugs at concentrations that can be achieved clinically ( up to 0.1 µM MTX and 1.0 µM DB00603 ) . Furthermore , using a immunodeficient mouse model that supports the engraftment of central memory derived human T cells , in vivo selection studies demonstrate that huEGFRt(+) P00374 (FS+) P12268 (IY+) T cells could be enriched following adoptive transfer either by systemic administration of MTX alone ( 4.4 -fold ) , DB00688 alone ( 2.9-fold ) , or combined MTX and DB00688 ( 4.9-fold ) . These findings demonstrate the utility of both P00374 (FS)/MTX and P12268 (IY)/ DB00688 for in vivo selection of lentivirally transduced human T cells . Vectors incorporating these muteins in combination with other therapeutic transgenes may facilitate the selective engraftment of therapeutically active cells in recipients .
