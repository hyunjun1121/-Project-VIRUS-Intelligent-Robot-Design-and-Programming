Antagonism of Q9GZP0 by human antibody DB05139 prevents renal scarring in experimental glomerulonephritis . Glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and/or matrix accumulation characterizes many progressive renal diseases . Q9GZP0 was identified recently as a novel mediator of mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo . This study investigated the long-term consequences of Q9GZP0 inhibition in vivo . Rats with progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis ( uninephrectomy plus anti-Thy-1.1 antibody ) received the Q9GZP0 -neutralizing , fully human mAb DB05139 on days 3 , 10 , and 17 after disease induction . Glomerular mesangioproliferative changes on day 10 were significantly reduced by anti- Q9GZP0 treatment as compared with control antibody . Eight weeks after disease induction , anti- Q9GZP0 therapy significantly ameliorated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , podocyte damage ( de novo desmin expression ) , tubulointerstitial damage , and fibrosis as well as the accumulation of renal interstitial matrix including type III collagen and fibronectin . Treatment with anti- Q9GZP0 also reduced the cortical infiltration of monocytes/macrophages on day 56 , possibly related to lower renal cortical complement activation ( C5b-9 deposition ) and/or reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( preserved cortical expression of P12830 and reduced expression of vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin ) . In conclusion , these data provide evidence for a causal role of Q9GZP0 in the pathogenesis of renal scarring and point to a new therapeutic approach to progressive mesangioproliferative renal disease .
