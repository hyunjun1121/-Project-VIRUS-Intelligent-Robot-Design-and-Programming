DB00482 offers a small protection from root resorption associated with orthodontic movement . Tooth movement results from alveolar bone resorption/deposition following application of orthodontic forces , and root resorption can be an undesirable complication associated with this process . No treatment for external root resorption is available to date . OBJECTIVE : To determine if P35354 inhibitors like DB00482 are effective in protecting root resorption associated with orthodontic forces . METHODS : A force of 80 grams was applied to the left maxillary first molars of 7-week-old female Wistar rats using nickel titanium closed coil springs attached to the cervical area of the incisors with 0.010 stainless-steel ligature wires . Twenty animals were divided into three experimental groups : one receiving no treatment , the second receiving 25mg/kg , and the third receiving 50 mg/kg of celecoxib ( DB00482 ) in their drinking water . Rats were maintained on a soft diet and euthanized two weeks after initial placement of the force . Paraffin-embedded sections of the right ( control ) and left ( experimental ) maxillae were stained with H & E and the areas of root resorption were examined by counting the number of lacunaes in the roots . RESULTS : No difference in the distance of tooth movement ( 0.5 mm/two weeks ) was seen in all three groups . The rats that received the low dose of DB00482 showed no statistically significant difference in root resorption than that of the rats that received no dose . The rats that received the high dose of DB00482 showed a lower number of lacunaes ( mean = 3.5 ) than that of the control group ( mean 10.2 ; p=0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Administration of DB00482 during the application of orthodontic forces does not interfere with tooth movement and appears to offer some slight protection against root resorption .
