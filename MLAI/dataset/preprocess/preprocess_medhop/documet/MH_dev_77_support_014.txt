Enhanced production and secretion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor from the skin in atopic dermatitis mouse model . Role of neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) in the mechanism of overgrowth and hypersensitivity of sensory nerve in atopic dermatitis ( AD ) has been proposed . P39905 ( P39905 ) is a member of neurotrophic factors of the nervous systems ; however , the role of P39905 in dermatitis is unknown . Q14116 promotes Th2 type allergic condition in skin and various organs in the absence of IL-12 . In this report , we evaluated the expression of P39905 in AD and its association with P01138 and Q14116 . Mice expressing skin-specific Q14116 ( KIL18Tg ) or caspase-1 , an Q14116 converting enzyme , ( KCASP1Tg ) were used as AD models ; P39905 expression was examined by RT-PCR , enzyme immunoassay , and immunohistochemistry . The mRNA expressions of P39905 and P01138 were detected in the epidermis and they were increased in the skin of KIL18Tg and KCASP1Tg mice . P39905 protein production in the skin was also elevated in both transgenic mice and mostly expressed at the basal layer of the epidermis as assessed by immunohistochemistry . Furthermore , the number of nerve fibers was increased in KCASP1Tg , suggesting increased cutaneous innervation . The present results suggest that in addition to P01138 , elevated production and secretion of P39905 in the skin associated with overproduction of Q14116 may also be a potent causative factor of itching in AD .
