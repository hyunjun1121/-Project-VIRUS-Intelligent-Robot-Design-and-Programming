Q9UBN7 -mediated selective autophagy regulates P48444 -associated cilia dysfunction . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) involves aberrant airway inflammatory responses to cigarette smoke ( CS ) that are associated with epithelial cell dysfunction , cilia shortening , and mucociliary clearance disruption . Exposure to CS reduced cilia length and induced autophagy in vivo and in differentiated mouse tracheal epithelial cells ( MTECs ) . Autophagy-impaired ( Becn1+/- or Map1lc3B-/- ) mice and MTECs resisted CS-induced cilia shortening . Furthermore , CS increased the autophagic turnover of ciliary proteins , indicating that autophagy may regulate cilia homeostasis . We identified cytosolic deacetylase Q9UBN7 as a critical regulator of autophagy-mediated cilia shortening during CS exposure . Mice bearing an X chromosome deletion of Hdac6 ( Hdac6-/Y ) and MTECs from these mice had reduced autophagy and were protected from CS-induced cilia shortening . Autophagy-impaired Becn1-/- , Map1lc3B-/- , and Hdac6-/Y mice or mice injected with an Q9UBN7 inhibitor were protected from CS-induced mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) disruption . MCC was preserved in mice given the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid , but was disrupted in mice lacking the transcription factor Q16236 , suggesting that oxidative stress and altered proteostasis contribute to the disruption of MCC . Analysis of human P48444 specimens revealed epigenetic deregulation of Q9UBN7 by hypomethylation and increased protein expression in the airways . We conclude that an autophagy-dependent pathway regulates cilia length during CS exposure and has potential as a therapeutic target for P48444 .
