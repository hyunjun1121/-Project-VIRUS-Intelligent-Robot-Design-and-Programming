A combination of molecular cytogenetic analyses reveals complex genetic alterations in conventional renal cell carcinoma . Here we report the complex pattern of genomic imbalances and rearrangements in a panel of 19 renal cell carcinoma cell lines detected with molecular cytogenetic analysis . Consistent heterogeneity in chromosome number was found , and most cell lines showed a near-triploid chromosome complement . Several cell lines showed deletions of the P04637 ( alias p53 ) , CDKN2A ( alias p16 ) , and P40337 genes . Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization ( M- Q5TCZ1 ) analysis revealed chromosome 3 translocated to several other partners chromosomes , as well as breakage events commonly affecting chromosomes 1 , 5 , 8 , 10 , and 17 . The most common abnormality detected with comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) was deletions of chromosome 3p , with loss of the Q9NS23 , P49789 , and p44S10 loci frequently involved . CGH gain of 5q showed overrepresentation of the P18146 and P07333 genes . Recurrent alterations to chromosome 7 included rearrangement of 7q11 and gains of the P00533 , O15164 , and P35250 genes . Several lines exhibited rearrangement of 12q11 approximately q14 and overrepresentation of P11802 and SAS loci . M- Q5TCZ1 revealed several other recurrent translocations , and CGH findings included loss of 9p , 14q , and 18q and gain of 8q , 12 , and 20 . Further genomic microarray changes included loss of Q13126 , IGH@ , P28222 , and Q13485 ( previously Q13485 ) and gains of MYC and P11387 . An excellent correlation was observed between the genomic array and Q5TCZ1 data , demonstrating that this technique is effective and accurate . The aberrations detected here may reflect important pathways in renal cancer pathogenesis .
