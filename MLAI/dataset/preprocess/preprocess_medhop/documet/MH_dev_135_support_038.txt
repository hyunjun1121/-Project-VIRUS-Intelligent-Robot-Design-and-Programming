Q03135 tyrosine phosphorylation enhances paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity . Q03135 ( Q03135 ) , a highly conserved membrane-associated protein , is a putative regulator of cellular transformation . Q03135 is localized in the plasmalemma , secretory vesicles , Golgi , mitochondria , and endoplasmic reticulum membrane and associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton . Taxanes such as paclitaxel ( DB01229 ) are potent anti-tumor agents that repress the dynamic instability of microtubules and arrest cells in the G(2)/M phase . Src phosphorylation of DB00135 -14 on Q03135 regulates its cellular localization and function . We report that phosphorylation of Q03135 on DB00135 -14 regulates paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . Befitting its role as a multitasking molecule , we show that Q03135 sensitizes cells to apoptosis by regulating cell cycle progression and activation of the apoptotic signaling molecules P10415 , p53 , and P38936 . We demonstrate that phosphorylated Q03135 triggers apoptosis by inactivating P10415 and increasing mitochondrial permeability more efficiently than non-phosphorylated Q03135 . Furthermore , expression of P38936 , which correlates with taxane sensitivity , is regulated by Q03135 phosphorylation in a p53-dependent manner . Collectively , our findings underscore the importance of Q03135 phosphorylation in apoptosis and suggest that events that negate Q03135 tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to anti-microtubule drug resistance .
