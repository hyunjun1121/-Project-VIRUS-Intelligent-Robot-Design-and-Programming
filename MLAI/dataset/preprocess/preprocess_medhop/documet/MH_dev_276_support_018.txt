Constitutively active Gq/11-coupled receptors enable signaling by co-expressed G(i/o)-coupled receptors . Co-expression of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory ( G ) protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , such as the G(i/o)-coupled human P28222 ( 5-HT(1B)R ) , with the G(q/11)-coupled human histamine 1 receptor ( P35367 ) results in an overall increase in agonist-independent signaling , which can be augmented by 5-HT(1B)R agonists and inhibited by a selective inverse 5-HT(1B)R agonist . Interestingly , inverse P35367 agonists inhibit constitutively P35367 -mediated as well as 5-HT(1B)R agonist-induced signaling in cells co-expressing both receptors . This phenomenon is not solely characteristic of 5-HT(1B)R ; it is also evident with muscarinic M2 and adenosine A1 receptors and is mimicked by mastoparan-7 , an activator of G(i/o) proteins , or by over-expression of Gbetagamma subunits . Likewise , expression of the G(q/11)-coupled human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) -encoded chemokine receptor US28 unmasks a functional coupling of G(i/o)-coupled P32246 receptors that is mediated via the constitutive activity of receptor US28 . Consequently , constitutively active G(q/11)-coupled receptors , such as the P35367 and HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28 , constitute a regulatory switch for signal transduction by G(i/o)-coupled receptors , which may have profound implications in understanding the role of both constitutive GPCR activity and GPCR cross-talk in physiology as well as in the observed pathophysiology upon HCMV infection .
