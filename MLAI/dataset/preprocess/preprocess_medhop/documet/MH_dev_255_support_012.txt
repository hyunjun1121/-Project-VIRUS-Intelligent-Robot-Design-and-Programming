Statin decreases endothelial microparticle release from human coronary artery endothelial cells : implication for the Rho-kinase pathway . OBJECTIVE : Elevated plasma levels of endothelial microparticles ( EMPs ) are associated with the presence of clinical atherosclerosis . Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of P04035 inhibitors on the endothelium , we studied the effect of fluvastatin on the release of EMPs in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAEC ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : EMPs were generated in P01375 -activated HCAECs . The absolute number of EMPs was enumerated using a novel two-color flow cytometric immunostaining technique with TruCount beads as an internal reference . EMPs are defined as EC membrane vesicles ( 1-2 microm in size ) with a characteristic immunophenotype . The addition of fluvastatin to P01375 -activated HCAECs significantly suppressed Q7L5Y9 release . DB01095 suppressed P01375 -induced Rho activation . The Rho-kinase inhibitor , Y-27632 , reproduced the effect of statin . CONCLUSION : Q7L5Y9 release from P01375 -activated HCAECs is suppressed by fluvastatin . In addition , the Rho/Rho-kinase may play an important role in modulating Q7L5Y9 release .
