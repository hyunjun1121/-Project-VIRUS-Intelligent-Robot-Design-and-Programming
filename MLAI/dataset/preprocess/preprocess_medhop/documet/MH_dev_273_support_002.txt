P11511 inhibitors and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors in endometriosis : new questions -- old answers ? The medical treatment of endometriosis needs to be optimized . Therapeutic management strategies for endometriosis-associated pain or recurrent disease are primarily aimed at downregulating ovarian function or antagonizing the effect of estrogen in ectopic endometrial implants . In this context , basic research is providing important results for the development of new , specific treatment modalities . P11511 overexpression has recently been detected in endometriotic tissue . P11511 ( p450arom ) is responsible for converting C19 androgens into estrogen in several types of human tissue . P11511 activity causes local estrogen biosynthesis , which , in turn , stimulates prostaglandin E2 production by upregulating cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) . Thus , a positive feedback cycle develops between the two systems . Another abnormality in endometriosis , the deficient 17beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type II ( 17beta-HSD-Type-II ) expression , impairs the inactivation of estradiol to estrone . In contrast to the eutopic endometrium , these molecular aberrations increase the amount of local estradiol and prostaglandin E2 in endometriosis . In several human cell lines , prostaglandin and estrogen concentrations are associated with proliferation , migration , angiogenesis , apoptosis resistance and even invasiveness . Consequently , aromatase and P35354 are thought to be promising new therapeutic targets . Thus , specific aromatase inhibitors ( e.g. DB01006 / DB01006 , DB01217 /Arimidex or Exemestan/Aromasin ) or selective P35354 inhibitors ( e.g. Celecoxib/ DB00482 , DB00533 /Vioxx , DB00580 /Bextra ) are of great interest and should be studied in clinical trials in premenopausal woman with endometriosis to expand the spectrum of currently available treatment options .
