Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the Wistar rat : dependence of MBP-specific T cell responsiveness on P33681 costimulation . Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) is an animal model of human multiple sclerosis that requires the activation of autoreactive T cells for the expression of pathology . EAE has been most frequently studied in the Lewis rat model as well as in several murine models of EAE including the PLJ and B10PL strains . In the present study we describe a novel model of EAE induced in the Wistar rat strain by immunization with guinea pig spinal cord antigens and pertussis toxin ( PT ) . T cell responses were induced to myelin basic protein . Autoreactive T cells could be totally blocked by the in vitro treatment with DB01281 , a protein that blocks the costimulation of autoreactive T cells . The addition of P60568 could reverse the inhibition seen in vitro with DB01281 . The effects of inhibition of P33681 costimulation were also examined by an analysis of cytokine responses and P60568 receptor on T cells . DB01281 treatment in vitro reduced the expression of P60568 receptor on T cells , enhanced T cell apoptosis and decreased the synthesis of P60568 , P01579 and P01375 . DB01281 treatment had no effect on P22301 synthesis by T cells , a cytokine implicated in the functions of regulatory T cell subsets . Overall , our studies support the rationale of P33681 blocking therapies as a potential treatment for models of multiple sclerosis . The induction of EAE in the Wistar rat provides yet another novel model in which to examine the regulation of T cell autoimmunity .
