[ Signal transduction inhibitor -- STI571 -- a new treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which opens a new targeted approach to cancer therapy ] . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , in most of the cases , is the molecular consequence of the t(9,22) translocation , resulting in the Philadelphia ( Ph ) chromosome and the creation of the fusion gene P11274 - P00519 . The fusion gene is translated to the protooncogen P11274 - P00519 , a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is linked to the malignant transformation . Thus , this tyrosine kinase became an attractive target for drug design . The development of the novel investigational drug DB00619 is based on its potent and selective ability to inhibit this fusion tyrosine kinase . In preclinical studies , DB00619 selectively inhibited the growth of CML cells that carry the Ph chromosome . In this review we discuss the drug development and design , its mechanism of action , the preclinical studies and the results of phase I and II clinical trials .
