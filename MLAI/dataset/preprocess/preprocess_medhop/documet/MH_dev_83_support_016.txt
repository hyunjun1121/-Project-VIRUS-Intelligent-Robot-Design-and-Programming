Antitumor properties of dimethyl-celecoxib , a derivative of celecoxib that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 : implications for glioma therapy . Celecoxib ( DB00482 ) appears to be unique among the class of selective P35354 inhibitors ( coxibs ) , because this particular compound exerts a second function that is independent of its celebrated ability to inhibit P35354 . This second function is the potential to inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate apoptotic cell death at much lower concentrations than any other coxibs . Intriguingly , these two functions are mediated by different moieties of the celecoxib molecule and can be separated . The author , as well as others , have generated and investigated analogs of celecoxib that retain only one of these two functions . One derivative , 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib ( Q6UXB2 ) , which retains the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing function , but completely lacks the P35354 inhibitory activity , is able to mimic faithfully all of the numerous antitumor effects of celecoxib that have been investigated so far , including reduction of neovascularization and inhibition of experimental tumor growth in various in vivo tumor models . In view of the controversy that has recently arisen regarding the life-threatening side effects of this class of coxibs , it may be worthwhile to pursue further the potential benefits of drugs such as Q6UXB2 for anticancer therapy . Because Q6UXB2 is not a coxib yet potently maintains celecoxib 's antitumor potential , one may be inclined to speculate that this novel compound could potentially be advantageous in the management of P35354 -independent cancers . In this summary , the implications of recent findings with Q6UXB2 will be presented and discussed .
