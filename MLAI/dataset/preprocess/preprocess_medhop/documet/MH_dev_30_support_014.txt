Molecular predictors of combination targeted therapies ( cetuximab , bevacizumab ) in irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer ( BOND-2 study ) . BACKGROUND : To test whether intratumoral gene expression levels and germline polymorphisms predict clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patients treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab plus irinotecan ( CBI ) vs. cetuximab and bevacizumab ( CB ) (BOND2) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping from 65 patients ( 31 : CBI arm and 34 : CB arm ) . Thirty five patients had tissue samples available for the gene expression assay ( 18 : CBI arm and 17 : CB arm ) . RESULTS : High intratumoral gene expression levels of P00533 , P35968 and NRP1 were associated with longer overall survival ( OS ) in patients receiving combined monoclonal antibodies with or without irinotecan . P08637 V158F , CyclinD1 A870G and P00533 R497K polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in patients received combined cetuximab and bevacizumab . CONCLUSIONS : Intratumoral gene expression levels of P00533 , P35968 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in P08637 , CyclinD1 and P00533 could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2 , independent of P01116 mutation status .
