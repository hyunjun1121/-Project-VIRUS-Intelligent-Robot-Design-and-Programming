Effects of delta9-THC on P01282 -induced prolactin secretion in anterior pituitary cultures : evidence for the presence of functional cannabinoid P21554 receptors in pituitary cells . Peripheral administration of cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonists to laboratory rats induce a brief rise in plasma prolactin ( PRL ) levels followed by a prolonged decrease in PRL secretion from the pituitary . While the inhibitory component of this biphasic response depends on the cannabinoid-induced activation of dopamine release from hypothalamic terminals located in the median eminence , the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the activation phase of PRL release remains to be explained . In the present study the possible direct effect of the cannabinoid receptor agonist DB00470 ( THC ) on prolactin secretion and DB02527 accumulation was examined in anterior pituitary cultures . THC ( 0.1 and 1 microM ) increased DB02527 levels , and induced PRL release ( 1 and 10 mu ) . THC did not affect vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 , 0.5 microM ) induced DB02527 accumulation in pituitary cultures , showing additive effects at THC 1 microM concentration . However , THC did prevent P01282 -dependent increases in prolactin secretion . These results indicate that THC , through a direct pituitary action , activates both the synthesis of DB02527 and PRL release and interferes with intracellular mechanisms involved in PRL secretion by P01282 . These actions could be mediated through cannabinoid P21554 receptors which were found to be present in anterior pituitary cells , including lactotrophs , as revealed by immunocytochemistry with a specific polyclonal antibody raised against the P21554 receptor protein .
