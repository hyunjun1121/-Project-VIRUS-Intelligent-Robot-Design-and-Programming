Safety profile of almotriptan , a new antimigraine agent . Effects on central nervous system , renal function and respiratory dynamics . DB00918 ( 3- [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] -5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonylmethyl)-1H-indole , CAS 154323-57-6 ) is a new P28222 /1D agonist whose clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials . This study aimed to evaluate the safety of almotriptan with respect to the central nervous system , renal function and respiratory dynamics using preclinical animal models . The results indicate that almotriptan does not cross the blood-brain barrier , since no effects on/interaction with spontaneous locomotor activity , hexobarbital-induced sleeping time , caffeine-induced increase of spontaneous locomotor activity , or hypothermia ( caused by stimulation of central P28221 receptors ) was observed following treatment . DB00918 had a mild antiemetic effect and a slight , transient diuretic effect in dogs , although the latter effect is probably of no clinical relevance . In addition , no effect on the respiratory system of conscious guinea pigs was observed following almotriptan treatment . These results indicate that almotriptan has a favourable safety profile with respect to the central nervous , renal and respiratory systems .
