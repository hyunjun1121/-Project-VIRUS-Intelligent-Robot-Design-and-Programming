Mechanisms underlying altered extracellular nucleotide-induced contractions in mesenteric arteries from rats in later-stage type 2 diabetes : effect of P03950 II type 1 receptor antagonism . Little is known about the vascular contractile responsiveness to , and signaling pathways for , extracellular nucleotides in the chronic stage of type 2 diabetes or whether the P03950 II type 1 receptor blocker losartan might alter such responses . We hypothesized that nucleotide-induced arterial contractions are augmented in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki ( GK ) rats and that treatment with losartan would normalize the contractions . Here , we investigated the vasoconstrictor effects of DB00171 /UTP in superior mesenteric arteries isolated from GK rats ( 37-42 wk old ) that had or had not received 2 wk of losartan ( 25 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) ) . In arteries from GK rats ( vs. those from Wistar rats ) , 1 ) DB00171 - and UTP-induced contractions , which were blocked by the nonselective P2 antagonist suramin , were enhanced , and these enhancements were suppressed by endothelial denudation , by cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitors , or by a cytosolic phospholipase A(2) ( cPLA(2) ) inhibitor ; 2 ) both nucleotides induced increased release of PGE(2) and P49763 (2α) ; 3 ) nucleotide-stimulated cPLA(2) phosphorylations were increased ; 4 ) P23219 and P35354 expressions were increased ; and 5 ) neither P41231 nor Q15077 receptor expression differed , but P51582 receptor expression was decreased . Mesenteric arteries from GK rats treated with losartan exhibited ( vs. untreated GK ) 1 ) reduced nucleotide-induced contractions , 2 ) suppressed UTP-induced release of PGE(2) and P49763 (2α) , 3 ) suppressed UTP-stimulated cPLA(2) phosphorylation , 4 ) normalized expressions of P35354 and P51582 receptors , and 5 ) reduced superoxide generation . Our data suggest that the diabetes-related enhancement of DB00171 -mediated vasoconstriction was due to P2Y receptor-mediated activation of the cPLA(2)/ P36551 pathway and , moreover , that losartan normalizes such contractions by a suppressing action within this pathway .
