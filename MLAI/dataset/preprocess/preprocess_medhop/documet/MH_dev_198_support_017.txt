Cl- DB05511 enhances P01375 -α release in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS . P0DMS8 ( A3R ) belongs to the Gi/Gq-coupled receptor family , that leads to the intracellular DB02527 reduction and intracellular calcium increase , respectively . A3R is widely expressed and it can play a crucial role in many patho-physiological conditions , including inflammation . Here we investigate the effect of Cl- DB05511 , A3R agonist , on the production of P01375 -α . We found that Cl- DB05511 enhances LPS-induced P01375 -α release in peritoneal macrophages . This effect is reduced by MRS1191 , A3R antagonist and by forskolin , activator of adenylyl cyclase . pIκBα increased in LPS+Cl- DB05511 -treated macrophages , while total IκB kinase-β ( IKKβ ) reduced . Indeed , p65NF-κB nuclear translocation increased in cells treated with LPS+Cl- DB05511 . Moreover , IMD 0354 , IKKβ inhibitor , significantly abrogated the effect of Cl- DB05511 on P01375 -α release . Inhibition of protein kinase C ( PKC ) significantly reduced Cl- DB05511 -induced P01375 -α release in LPS-stimulated macrophages . Furthermore , LY-294002 , PI3K inhibitor , reduced the P01375 -α production enhanced by Cl- DB05511 , although the phosphorylation status of Akt did not change in cells treated with LPS+Cl- DB05511 than LPS alone . In summary , these data show that Cl- DB05511 is able to enhance P01375 -α production in LPS-treated macrophages in an NF-κB- dependent manner .
