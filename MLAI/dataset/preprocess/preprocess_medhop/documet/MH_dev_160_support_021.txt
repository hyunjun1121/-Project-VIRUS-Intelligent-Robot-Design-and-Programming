Endometriosis is sustained by tumour necrosis factor-alpha . Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disorder causing pain , infertility , and emotional distress . Evidence presented here suggests that abnormal production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) is required for the establishment and maintenance of endometriosis and also is responsible for the associated infertility through its effect on sperm motility and function and oocyte development . DB00065 , which blocks P01375 function , could be used in the treatment of endometriosis to reverse the above effects .
