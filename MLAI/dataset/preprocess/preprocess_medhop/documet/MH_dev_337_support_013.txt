DB00131 cyclase 1 ( Q08828 ) mutations cause recessive hearing impairment in humans and defects in hair cell function and hearing in zebrafish . DB02527 ( DB02527 ) production , which is important for mechanotransduction within the inner ear , is catalyzed by adenylate cyclases ( AC ) . However , knowledge of the role of ACs in hearing is limited . Previously , a novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus DFNB44 was mapped to chromosome 7p14.1-q11.22 in a consanguineous family from Pakistan . Through whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from hearing-impaired family members , a nonsense mutation c.3112C > T ( p.Arg1038* ) within adenylate cyclase 1 ( Q08828 ) was identified . This stop-gained mutation segregated with hearing impairment within the family and was not identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases . This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail , including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain , plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect , both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency . Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric , mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment . Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response , indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment . In the mouse , Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation . Q08828 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia . Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of Q08828 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli . These results demonstrate that Q08828 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that DB02527 signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear .
