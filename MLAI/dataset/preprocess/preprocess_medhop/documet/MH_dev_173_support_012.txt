Suppression of P05121 expression through inhibition of the P00533 -mediated signaling cascade in rat kidney fibroblast by ascofuranone . Fibrosis in glomerulosclerosis causes progressive loss of renal function . Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , one of the major profibrotic cytokines , induces the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 , a factor that plays a crucial role in the development of fibrosis . Here , we found that an isoprenoid antibiotic , ascofuranone , suppresses expression of profibrotic factors including matrix proteins and P05121 induced by TGF-beta in renal fibroblasts . Ascofuranone selectively inhibits phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , and downstream kinases such as P04049 , MEK-1/2 , and P27361 /2 . P05121 transcription also is suppressed by treatment with kinase inhibitors for MEK-1/2 or P00533 , and with small interfering RNA for P00533 . Ascofuranone inhibits cellular metalloproteinase activity , and an inhibitor of metalloproteinases suppresses P00533 phosphorylation and P05121 transcription . These results suggest that ascofuranone suppresses expression of profibrotic factors through the inhibition of an P00533 -dependent signal transduction pathway activated by metalloproteinases .
