Involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase module in HIV-mediated P01730 signals controlling activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and AP-1 transcription factors . Although the molecular mechanisms by which the HIV-1 triggers either T cell activation , anergy , or apoptosis remain poorly understood , it is well established that the interaction of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins with cell surface P01730 delivers signals to the target cell , resulting in activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappa B and AP-1 . In this study , we report the first evidence indicating that kinases MEK-1 ( Q96HU1 kinase/Erk kinase ) and P27361 ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase ) act as intermediates in the cascade of events that regulate NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation upon HIV-1 binding to cell surface P01730 . We found that CEM cells transfected with dominant negative forms of MEK-1 or P27361 do not display NF-kappa B activation after HIV-1 binding to P01730 . In contrast , NF-kappa B activation was observed in these cells after PMA stimulation . Although the different cell lines studied expressed similar amounts of P01730 and p56(lck) , HIV-1 replication and HIV-1-induced apoptosis were slightly delayed in cells expressing dominant negative forms of MEK-1 or P27361 compared with parental CEM cells and cells expressing a constitutively active mutant form of MEK-1 or wild-type P27361 . In light of recently published data , we propose that a positive signal initiated following oligomerization of P01730 by the virus is likely to involve a recruitment of active forms of p56(lck) , P04049 , MEK-1 , and P27361 , before AP-1 and NF-kappa B activation .
