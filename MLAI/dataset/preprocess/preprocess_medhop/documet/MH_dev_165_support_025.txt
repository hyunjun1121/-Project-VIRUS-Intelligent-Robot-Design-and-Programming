The effects of five alkaloids from Bulbus Fritillariae on the concentration of DB02527 in P29320 cells transfected with muscarinic M(2) receptor plasmid . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of five alkaloids , namely verticine , verticinone , imperialine , imperialine-3beta-D-glucoside , and puqietinone , purified from Bulbus Fritillariae and used as an antitussive drug in traditional Chinese medicine , on their antimuscarinic M(2) function and the DB02527 level of P29320 cells transfected with muscarinic M(2) receptor plasmid . By transfecting the P29320 cells with the method of calcium phosphate co-precipitation and screening with G418 , the cells stably expressing M(2) receptor were identified . The expression of M(2) receptor in P29320 cells was confirmed by both RT-PCR and western blot . The DB02527 level in the treated cells was analyzed with RIA method ( (125)I- DB02527 P10721 ) . And the results suggested that the five alkaloids could significantly elevate the DB02527 concentration in the P29320 cells transfected with muscarinic M(2) receptor plasmid ( p < 0.01 ) .
