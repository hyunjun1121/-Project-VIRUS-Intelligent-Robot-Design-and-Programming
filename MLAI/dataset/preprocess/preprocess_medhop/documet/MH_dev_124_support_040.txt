Inhibition of serum-stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase by 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . DB00136 [ DB00136 ] , the hormonally active form of vitamin D3 , has been shown to be a potent negative growth regulator of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo . DB00136 acts through two different mechanisms . In addition to regulating gene transcription via its specific intracellular receptor ( vitamin D receptor , P11473 ) , DB00136 induces rapid , non-transcriptional responses involving activation of transmembrane signal transduction pathways , like growth factors and peptide hormones . The mechanisms that mediate the antiproliferative effects of DB00136 in breast cancer cells are not fully understood . Particularly , there is no information about the early non-genomic signal transduction effectors modulated by the hormone . The present study shows that DB00136 rapidly inhibits serum induced activation of P27361 and P28482 Q96HU1 kinases . The tyrosine kinase Src is involved in the pathway leading to activation of P29323 1/2 by serum . Furthermore , DB00136 increases the tyrosine-phosphorylated state of Src and inhibits its kinase activity , while induces the association of the P11473 with Src , either in the presence or absence of serum . In parallel , the hormone rapidly increases the amounts of P11473 associated to plasma membranes ( PM ) . Pretreatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors orthovanadate or bpV ( phen ) prevented mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibition by DB00136 . These data altogether suggest that DB00136 inhibits the MAPK cascade by inactivating Src tyrosine kinase through a mechanism mediated by the P11473 and tyrosine phosphatases .
