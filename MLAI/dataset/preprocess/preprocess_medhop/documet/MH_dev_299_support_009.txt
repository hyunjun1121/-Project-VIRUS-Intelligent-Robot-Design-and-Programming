Does computational biology help us to understand the molecular phylogenetics and evolution of cluster of differentiation ( CD ) proteins ? Cluster of differentiation ( CD ) is a group of proteins with highly immunological and medical importance , and some are established therapeutics . These membrane proteins are used to investigate of cell surface molecules of blood cells especially WBC . We selected a population of fifteen members with most medical importance , which includes P06729 , P01730 , P06127 , P30203 , P09564 , P21926 , P08571 , CD16 , P15391 , P20273 , P10747 , P20138 , P16671 , P28907 , and P16070 and performed in silico analysis using algorithm analysis and mathematical models . The results suggest that LEU ( L ) is well aligned . CD16 is rooted with P20273 and likewise , P01730 is closely related to P16070 . Notably , highest number of highly conserved amino acids is recorded in P20273 . WebLogo were formed up to 350 amino acid position and DB00134 ( M ) is found to be tallest logo . Our results would be useful for upcoming researchers to obtain fundamental idea about the particular regions CD proteins which is having the structural and functional significance related to the evolutionary biology .
