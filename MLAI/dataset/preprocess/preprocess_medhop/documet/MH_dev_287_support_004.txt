[ The importance of determination of interleukin-10 in the blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ] . BACKGROUND : Hitherto , not very numerous investigations provided so far only few often controversial findings on the importance of interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . The objective of the present investigation was to assess whether there exist practically applicable relations between the serum level of P22301 , clinical and laboratory indicators of activity of the disease and serum levels of selected cytokines or their soluble receptors . METHODS AND RESULTS : The authors analyzed a group of 23 patients with SLE ( 23 women and 1 man , median age 37 years ) . P22301 and other cytokines were examined by the ELISA method , the clinical activity of the disease was evaluated by the ECLAM system ( European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement ) . Elevated P22301 values ( > 5 pg/ml ) were assessed in 10 ( 43 % ) patients . Correlation analysis ( Pearson 's test , p < 0.05 ) revealed statistically significant relations between P22301 levels and the activity of the disease , values of antibody levels against dsDNA and levels of the soluble receptor P60568 ( sIL-2R ) in serum . Conversely , no relationship was revealed between values of P22301 and values of P01024 and C4 complement components , IL-1 , P60568 , P05231 , sIL-6R , P01375 , sTNFR-alpha and P27352 -gamma . CONCLUSIONS : Elevated P22301 serum levels in patients with SLE did not have , with the exception of the index of clinical activity of the disease , antibodies against dsDNA and sIL-2R any statistically significant relations to laboratory indicators of disease activity and levels of selected cytokines and their soluble receptors .
