DB00054 as an adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions . INTRODUCTION : Platelets play a central role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) and activation of platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor is critical to platelet aggregation . DB00054 , a human murine chimeric antibody to the P08514 /IIIa receptor , is an important biological therapy in the management of patients presenting with ACS . AREAS COVERED : The objective of this review is to define the role of abciximab in the management of ACS by interpreting the available data from randomized clinical trials using abciximab in various clinical scenarios , particularly in percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) . We also review different modes of delivery and describe the adverse effects of abciximab including thrombocytopenia . Where possible , we attempt to compare abciximab to the other available P08514 /IIIa inhibitors . We hope the reader will gain a better understanding of the benefits and risks of abciximab and the important role it has in the management of cardiology patients . EXPERT OPINION : DB00054 was a breakthrough drug in the management of high risk ACS patients undergoing P05154 . However , with newer available therapies and improvement in P05154 technology , dose and delivery of this drug have evolved as we try to extract maximum benefit while minimizing the adverse effects associated with it .
