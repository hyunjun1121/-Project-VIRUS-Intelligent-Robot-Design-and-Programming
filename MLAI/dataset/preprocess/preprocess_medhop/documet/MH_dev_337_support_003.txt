Bronchodilators modulate inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) is characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation and oxidative stress . Leukotriene B₄ ( LTB₄ ) , a potent proinflammatory mediator , is synthesized by P09917 ( P09917 ) , which is activated by the presence of lipid hydroperoxides resulting from oxidative stress on biological membranes . We proposed to evaluate the effect of a four week treatment with two different bronchodilators of common practice in P48444 treatment , on the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , in particular superoxide anions , and of LTB₄ by peripheral blood neutrophils obtained from P48444 subjects . 24 subjects among the P48444 outpatients were enrolled , and randomized to receive either formoterol ( 12 μg bid ) or tiotropium ( 18 μg od ) . Peripheral blood neutrophils were obtained at the start and at the end of the treatment , and production of superoxide anions and of LTB₄ were evaluated as previously published . The results obtained showed a decrease in the unstimulated production of superoxide by isolated neutrophils in both groups , but tiotropium only was effective in modulating the production of LTB₄ , while formoterol caused an increased production of superoxide in response to fMLP , when compared to values obtained before treatment . In conclusion , tiotropium showed a better antiinflammatory activity profile when compared to formoterol in a clinical setting , reducing superoxide and LTB₄ production by peripheral neutrophils obtained from P48444 subjects .
