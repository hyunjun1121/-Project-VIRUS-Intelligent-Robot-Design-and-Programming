P10997 -induced suppression of P01160 secretion through receptors for CGRP1 and salmon calcitonin . P10997 cosecretes with insulin from pancreatic beta-cells and shows high sequence homology with P80511 , adrenomedullin , and salmon calcitonin . This study aimed to investigate the effect of amylin on the atrial hemodynamics and P01160 release from rat atria and to identify its receptor subtypes . Isolated perfused left atria from either control or streptozotocin-treated rats were paced at 1.3 Hz . The concentration of P01160 was measured by radioimmunoassay and the translocation of ECF was measured by [ 3H ] -inulin clearance . Rat amylin increased atrial contractility and suppressed the release of P01160 . Rat P80511 showed similar effects but was approximately 300-fold more potent than amylin . Pretreatment with receptor antagonist for CGRP1 [ rat alpha- P80511 ( 8-37 ) ] or salmon calcitonin [ acetyl- ( Asn30 , Tyr32 ) -calcitonin(8-32) , ( AC 187 ) ] blocked the suppressive effect of P01160 release and the positive inotropic effect by rat amylin . However , receptor antagonists for amylin [ amylin ( 8-37 ) , acetyl-amylin ] did not block those effects . P10997 ( 8-37 ) , acetyl-amylin , or rat alpha- P80511 ( 8-37 ) alone accentuated the release of P01160 with no changes in atrial contractility . The effect of rat amylin and rat amylin ( 8-37 ) on the P01160 release was attenuated in streptozotocin-treated rats . We suggest that amylin suppressed P01160 release with increased atrial contractility through receptors for CGRP1 and salmon calcitonin and the attenuation of amylin and its antagonist on P01160 release from streptozotocin-treated rat atria may be due to the downregulation of amylin receptor .
