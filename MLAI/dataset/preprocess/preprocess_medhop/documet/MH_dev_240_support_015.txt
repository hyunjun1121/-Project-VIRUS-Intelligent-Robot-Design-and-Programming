DB06155 inhibits P01375 -α-induced endothelial P05231 secretion via P21554 receptor and DB02527 -dependent protein kinase pathway . AIM : To investigate whether rimonabant , a cannabinoid receptor antagonist , had inhibitory effects on inflammatory reactions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . METHODS : P01375 -α-induced P05231 production was measured by ELISA and effects on related signaling pathways were investigated by immunoblot analysis . Cellular DB02527 level was measured using kinase-coupled luciferase reaction . RESULTS : DB06155 at 1 and 10 μmol/L significantly inhibited P01375 -α-induced P05231 production when added 15 , 30 and 60 minutes before P01375 -α treatment . DB06155 also inhibited P01375 -α-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase ( IKK ) α/β and IκB-α degradation . ACEA , a cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 ( P21554 ) agonist , added before rimonabant abolished the former effects of rimonabant . H-89 , an inhibitor of DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) , abolished the inhibitory effects of rimonabant on P01375 -α induced P05231 production . DB06155 also increased the phosphorylation of PKA regulatory subunit II ( PKA-RII ) , implying the essential role of PKA activation in the inhibitory effects of rimonabant . Treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor , wortmannin did not abolish the inhibitory effects of rimonabant on P01375 -α induced P05231 production . CONCLUSION : DB06155 had anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells and inhibited P01375 -α-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation , IκB-α degradation and P05231 production in HUVEC . This effect was related to P21554 antagonism and PKA activation .
