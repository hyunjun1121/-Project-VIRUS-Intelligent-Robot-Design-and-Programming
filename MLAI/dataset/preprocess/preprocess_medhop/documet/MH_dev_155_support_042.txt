Expression pattern and biochemical characteristics of a major epidermal retinol dehydrogenase . The biological functions of vitamin A in the epidermis are mediated by all-trans retinoic acid , which is biosynthesized from retinol in two oxidative reactions . The first step involves enzymatic conversion of retinol to retinaldehyde . The physiological significance and relative contributions of the various retinol dehydrogenases to the oxidation of retinol in epidermal cells remain unclear . We report the characterization of a retinol dehydrogenase/reductase of the SDR superfamily , hRoDH-E2 , which is abundantly expressed in the epidermis , epidermal appendages and in cultured epidermal keratinocytes . Both in live keratinocytes and in isolated keratinocyte microsomes , where the enzyme normally localizes , hRoDH-E2 functions as a bona fide retinol dehydrogenase . In the prevailing oxidative reaction it recognizes both free- and P09455 -bound retinol , and shows preference toward NADP as a co-substrate . In comparison , hRoDH-E2 retinol dehydrogenase activity in the simple epithelial P29320 293 cells is much lower and in CHO cells is non-existent . hRoDH-E2 transcripts are distributed throughout the epidermal layers but are more abundant in the basal cells . In contrast , the protein is detected predominantly in the basal and the most differentiated living layers . Its synthesis is negatively regulated by retinoic acid . The biochemical properties and the differential expression of hRoDH-E2 in the strata where retinoic acid signaling is critical for epidermal homeostasis support a conclusion that hRoDH-E2 bears the characteristics of the major microsomal retinol dehydrogenase activity in the epidermal keratinocytes in physiological circumstances .
