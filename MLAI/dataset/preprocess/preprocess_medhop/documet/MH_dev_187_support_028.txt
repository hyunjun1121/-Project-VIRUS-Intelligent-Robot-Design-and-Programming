Differentiation of dopaminergic neurons from human embryonic stem cells : modulation of differentiation by Q9NP95 . Derivation of midbrain dopaminergic ( DA ) neurons from human embryonic stem ( hES ) cells has been of particular interest because of the clinical potential for DA neuron transplantation in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Several protocols for DA neuron differentiation from mouse embryonic stem cells and hES cells have been reported : however , protocols involving hES cells have yet to be improved . Here , we used a slightly modified stromal cell-derived inducing activity method , consisting four different culture stages , to show that KhES-1 cells differentiate into tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive DA neurons . Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed a marked induction of the DA neuron marker genes P43354 , paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 ( O75364 ) , LIM homeobox transcription- factor 1 , beta ( O60663 ) , engrailed-1 ( Q05925 ) , dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) , and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( P20711 ) during differentiation . Treatment with fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) -20 and P09038 at the final differentiation stage induced the increase of DA neuron development-related transcription factors such as P43354 , O75364 , O60663 , and Q05925 . Q9NP95 and P09038 enhanced DA neuron differentiation from hES cell-derived neural progenitor cells directly without any soluble factors from PA6 cells . These results provide valuable information that will assist in efficient DA neuron differentiation from hES cells and for future transplant application .
