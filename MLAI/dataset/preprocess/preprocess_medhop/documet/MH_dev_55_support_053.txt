P37231 ligands inhibit growth of human esophageal adenocarcinoma cells through induction of apoptosis , cell cycle arrest and reduction of ornithine decarboxylase activity . P37231 ( P37231 ) , a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily , is involved in suppression of growth of several types of tumors such as liposarcoma , breast cancer , prostate cancer , and colon cancer , possibly through induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis . In this study , we demonstrated expression of P37231 mRNA and protein in human esophageal carcinoma cells . Expression of P37231 protein was higher in an adenocarcinoma cell line ( TE-7 cells ) than in a squamous cell carcinoma cell line ( TE-1 cells ) . P37231 ligands such as 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 and troglitazone significantly inhibited the growth of TE-7 cells but had less or no effect on growth of TE-1 cells . 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone induced apoptosis in TE-7 cells but not in TE-1 cells . DB00197 caused P55008 cell cycle arrest and reduced ornithine decarboxylase activity ( ODC ) in TE-7 cells but not in TE-1 cells . Inhibition by P37231 ligands of growth of esophageal adenocarcinoma cells may thus be due to induction of apoptosis , P55008 cell cycle arrest and reduction of ODC activity .
