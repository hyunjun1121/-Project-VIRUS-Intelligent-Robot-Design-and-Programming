Transduction of P28906 + cells with lentiviral vectors enables the production of large quantities of transgene-expressing immature and mature dendritic cells . BACKGROUND : Genetically engineered dendritic cells ( DC ) presenting specific antigens to T cells may be of great interest for immunotherapy . For this reason , the production of transgene-expressing DC derived from P28906 + cells transduced either shortly after ex vivo purification or during their differentiation into DC were evaluated . METHODS : P28906 + cells were transduced with lentivectors encoding for GFP before or after 21 days of culture with P36888 -ligand , thrombopoietin and stem cell factor and induction into DC with GM- P04141 + P05112 ( G4 ) or G4+ P01375 ( GT4 ) . GFP and DC-specific marker expression was assessed by flow cytometry , and allostimulatory capacity was evaluated on GFP+ and GFP- sorted cells . RESULTS : Immature ( G4-induced ) DC obtained from amplified P28906 + cells were transducible by lentiviral vectors while mature ( GT4-induced ) DC were rather refractory . Moreover , since differentiated DC did not proliferate , large quantities of vectors were required to generate transgene-expressing cells with this protocol . In contrast , greater numbers of both immature and mature GFP- expressing DC were obtained with P28906 + cells exposed to lentivector shortly after purification . By the time of DC induction , GFP+ cells had increased by approximately 170-fold . After DC induction with G4 , 32 % of CD1a+ , HLA-DR+ , or P25942 + cells expressed GFP . CD1a+ P12830 + GFP+ Langerhans-like DC were also obtained . Incubation with P01375 induced mature Q01151 +GFP+ DC that displayed a higher allostimulatory capacity than cells induced with G4 alone . CONCLUSION : The transduction of a small number of P28906 + cells with minimal doses of lentivector may allow for the production of a large number of DC expressing selected antigens useful for immunotherapy .
