Effects of phenacetin and its metabolite p-phenetidine on P23219 and P35354 activities and expression in vitro . The present study was aimed to test the possible cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1/ P35354 selectivity of the old analgesic drug phenacetin and its metabolite p-phenetidine , which exhibits high renal toxicity . DB00316 ( acetaminophen ) , the main metabolite of phenacetin with low renal toxicity , and indomethacin were selected as reference compounds . Collagen-stimulated platelet thromboxane B2 ( TxB2 ) production and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced neutrophil prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) synthesis were used as indicators for P23219 and P35354 activity , respectively . DB03783 was even less potent than paracetamol to reduce the production of both TxB2 and DB00917 , and no clear preference for either of the P36551 -enzymes was seen . P-phenetidine was a more potent inhibitor , already at nanomolar level , of the synthesis of these prostanoids than indomethacin and showed some preference to P35354 inhibition . Somewhat higher , micromolar , concentrations of p-phenetidine also reduced P35354 expression in neutrophils . We suggest that the very potent inhibitory activity of p-phenetidine on DB00917 synthesis combined with the reduction of P35354 expression could explain the renal papillary necrosis in phenacetin kidney .
