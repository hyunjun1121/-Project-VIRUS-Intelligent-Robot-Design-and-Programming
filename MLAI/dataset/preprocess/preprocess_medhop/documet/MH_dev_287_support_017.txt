Oxidation of alcohols and reduction of aldehydes derived from methyl- and dimethylpyrenes by cDNA-expressed human alcohol dehydrogenases . Some methylated pyrenes can form DNA adducts in rat tissues after benzylic hydroxylation and sulpho conjugation . However , oxidation of the intermediate alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important competing pathway leading to detoxification . We previously showed that co-administration of ethanol or DB01213 strongly enhances DNA adduct formation by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene , indicating an involvement of alcohol dehydrogenases ( ADHs ) in the detoxification . This mechanism may be involved in the observed synergism of smoking and alcohol consumption in certain human cancers . In a preceding study , cDNA-expressed human P00325 efficiently oxidised 1- , 2- and 4-hydroxymethylpyrene ; these reactions were inhibited in the presence of ethanol or DB01213 . Here we report that P00326 , P00326 and P08319 also show substantial activity towards these substrates and two further congeners , 1-hydroxymethyl-6-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethyl-8-methylpyrene . All four DB00067 forms also catalysed the reverse reaction , implying that the aldehydes have to be sequestered by other enzymes , such as aldehyde dehydrogenases , for final detoxification . P00326 and P08319 activities towards hydroxymethylpyrenes were more strongly inhibited in the presence of ethanol and DB01213 than those of P00325 . P00326 was only inhibited at very high concentrations of the modulators . In conclusions , several human ADHs are capable of detoxifying benzylic alcohols of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . However , some competing substrates and inhibitors may affect all these redundant detoxification systems , although to various extents .
