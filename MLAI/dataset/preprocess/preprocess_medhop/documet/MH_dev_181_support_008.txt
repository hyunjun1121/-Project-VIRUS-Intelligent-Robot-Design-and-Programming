Role of histamine receptors in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by whole blood phagocytes . AIMS : The diverse physiological functions of histamine are mediated through distinct histamine receptors . In this study we investigated the role of P25021 and Q9H3N8 in the effects of histamine on the production of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes in whole blood . MAIN METHODS : Changes in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production by whole blood phagocytes after treatment with histamine , Q9H3N8 agonists ( 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 ) , P25021 agonist ( dimaprit ) and their combinations with Q9H3N8 antagonist ( JNJ10191584 ) and P25021 antagonist ( ranitidine ) were determined using the chemiluminescence ( CL ) assay . To exclude the direct scavenging effects of the studied compounds on the CL response , the antioxidant properties of all compounds were measured using several methods ( TRAP , ORAC , and luminol-HRP-H2O2 based CL ) . KEY FINDINGS : DB11320 , 4-methylhistamine , VUF8430 and dimaprit inhibited the spontaneous and OZP-activated whole blood CL in a dose-dependent manner . On the other hand , only VUF8430 was able to inhibit PMA-activated whole blood CL . DB00863 , but not JNJ10191584 , completely reduced the effects of histamine , 4-methylhistamine and dimaprit . The direct scavenging ability of tested compounds was negligible . SIGNIFICANCE : Our results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of histamine on ROS production in whole blood phagocytes were caused by P25021 . Our results also suggest that Q9H3N8 agonists in concentrations higher than 10(-6)M may also influence ROS production via binding to P25021 .
