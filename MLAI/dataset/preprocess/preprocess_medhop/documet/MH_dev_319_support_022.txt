P27361 /2 activation modulates pyocyanin-induced toxicity in A549 respiratory epithelial cells . Pyocyanin ( Q15149 ) , a virulence factor produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , has many damaging effects on mammalian cells . Several lines of evidence suggest that this damage is primarily mediated by its ability to generate oxidative stress . However mechanisms underlying Q15149 -induced oxidative injury remain unclear . Although oxidative stress and subsequent MAPK signaling has been shown to modulate cell death in other models , its role in Q15149 -induced cytotoxicity remains unknown . Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the role of redox-sensitive MAPK in Q15149 -induced toxicity in A549 cells . Here we show that Q15149 ( 50μM ) rapidly increased P27361 /2 phosphorylation after 5min . Pre-treatment of A549 cells with the Q02750 /2 inhibitor U0126 ( 10μM ) decreased Q15149 -induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation and protected cells against apoptosis and cell injury suggesting a role for P29323 signalling . In contrast , JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation remained unchanged following exposure to Q15149 and pretreatment with either the JNK or p38 MAPK inhibitors ( 10μM SP600125 and 10μM SB203580 , respectively ) did not afford protection against Q15149 toxicity . This would suggest that Q15149 -induced cytotoxicity appears to occur independently of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways . Finally , although we confirm that oxidative stress contributes to Q15149 -induced toxicity , our data suggest the contribution of oxidative stress is independent of P27361 /2 signaling . These findings may provide insight for novel targeted therapies to reduce Q15149 -mediated lung injury in patients with chronic P. aeruginosa respiratory infections .
