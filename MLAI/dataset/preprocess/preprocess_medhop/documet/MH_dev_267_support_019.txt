Synergistic inhibition of angiogenesis by artesunate and captopril in vitro and in vivo . Inhibition of angiogenesis represents one major strategy of cancer chemotherapy . In the present investigation , we investigated the synergism of artesunate and captopril to inhibit angiogenesis . DB09274 is an antimalarial derivative of artemisinin from the Chinese medicinal plant , Artemisia annua L. , which also reveals profound anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo . DB01197 is an angiotensin I-converting ( P12821 ) inhibitor , which is well established in Western academic medicine . Both compounds inhibited migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro . The combination of both drugs resulted in synergistically inhibited migration . Whereas artesunate inhibited HUVEC growth in the XTT assay , captopril did not , indicating independent modes of action . We established a chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) assay of quail embryos ( Coturnix coturnix L. ) and a computer-based evaluation routine for quantitative studies on vascularization processes in vivo . DB09274 and captopril inhibited blood vessel formation and growth . For the first time , we demonstrated that both drugs revealed synergistic effects when combined . These results may also have clinical impact , since cardiovascular diseases and cancer frequently occur together in older cancer patients . Therefore , comorbid patients may take advantage , if they take captopril to treat cardiovascular symptoms and artesunate to treat cancer .
