HIV-1 pathogenesis differs in rectosigmoid and tonsillar tissues infected ex vivo with P51681 - and P61073 -tropic HIV-1 . Gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( P07902 ) has been identified as the primary target of HIV-1 infection . To investigate why P07902 is especially vulnerable to HIV-1 , and to determine whether the selective transmission of P51681 -using viral variants ( R5 ) in vivo is the result of a greater susceptibility of P07902 to this viral variant , we performed comparative studies of P61073 -using ( X4 ) and R5 HIV-1 infections of human lymphoid ( tonsillar ) and rectosigmoid tissues ex vivo under controlled laboratory conditions . We found that the relative level of R5 replication in rectosigmoid tissue is much greater than in tonsillar tissue . This difference is associated with the expression of the P51681 co-receptor on approximately 70 % of P01730 T cells in rectosigmoid tissue , whereas in tonsillar tissue it is expressed on fewer than 15 % of P01730 T cells . Furthermore , tonsillar tissue responds to X4 HIV-1 infection by upregulating the secretion of CC-chemokines , providing a potential P51681 blockade and further resistance to R5 infection , whereas gut tissue failed to increase such innate immune responses . Our results show that rectosigmoid tissue is more prone than tonsillar lymphoid tissue to R5 HIV-1 infection , primarily because of the high prevalence and availability of R5 cell targets and reduced chemokine blockade . The majority of P01730 T cells express P61073 , however , and X4 HIV-1 readily replicates in both tissues , suggesting that although the differential expression of co-receptors contributes to the P07902 vulnerability to R5 HIV-1 , it alone can not account for the selective R5 infection of the rectal mucosa in vivo .
