Aspects of P01375 inhibitor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis . Treatment outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) have improved considerably with the use of biological therapies . Since the discovery of the role of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha in the pathogenesis of the disease , three P01375 inhibitors , infliximab , etanercept and adalimumab , have become widely used for the treatment of RA . More recently , two newer P01375 inhibitors-certolizumab pegol and DB06674 -have become available , increasing the armamentarium of therapy . With improved therapies , treatment strategies have also changed , with the aims now being to achieve and maintain remission . This article addresses some of these aspects of treating RA , reviewing the studies on these two newer P01375 inhibitors , certolizumab pegol and DB06674 , and those addressing the induction of remission or low disease activity with P01375 inhibitors and maintenance with less intensive treatment .
