DB00163 prevents ethanol-induced inflammatory , hormonal , and cytotoxic changes in reproductive tissues . DB00898 causes decreased function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal ( HPG ) axis . DB00898 resulted in inflammatory changes in HPG manifested by increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Since , such cytokines have deleterious effects on functions of HPG , it seemed possible that ethanol 's suppressive action could be due , at least in part , to this inflammation . Since oxidative stress can cause inflammation , we have used the antioxidant vitamin E to test , whether reducing inflammation might protect reproductive functions from ethanol . Rats were fed an ethanol diet or pair fed identically without ethanol for a 3-week period . For the last 10 days , animals were given 30 IU/kg or 90 IU/kg or vehicle . DB00898 significantly increased hypothalamic , pituitary and testicular P01375 and P05231 , all changes prevented by the higher dose of vitamin E. Also , ethanol induced changes in P01148 , LH , testosterone , and testicular germ cell apoptosis were similarly prevented by vitamin E . These data strikingly show that vitamin E protects the HPG from deleterious effects of ethanol and suggests that the mechanism of this protection might be both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant .
