Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) expression and soluble P05362 ( sICAM-1 ) production by cytokine-activated human aortic endothelial cells : a possible role for P05362 and sICAM-1 in atherosclerotic aortic aneurysms . The interactions of inflammatory cells , cytokines , and cell adhesion molecules ( P62158 ) may be important in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAA ) , in which inflammation plays a role . The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenic role of P05362 , a molecule involved in leucocyte-endothelial interactions , in vascular inflammation . ELISA of human explant culture supernatants revealed a four-fold increase in sICAM-1 production by AAA ( n = 9 ) versus normal ( n = 8 ) aortic explants . Human aortic endothelial cell ( hAEC ) culture was used for further studies as an in vitro model for aortic inflammatory conditions . Tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) or P01584 treatment of hAEC resulted in an up to 1.8-fold significant increase in sICAM-1 production compared with resting cells . In addition , the expression of P05362 on cytokine-stimulated versus resting hAEC was measured by radioimmunoassay . P01375 significantly induced P05362 expression on these cells . These results suggest that different forms of P05362 , present on or released by the activated aortic endothelium , may be involved in leucocyte adhesion to and migration into the vessel wall .
