P29323 activation causes epilepsy by stimulating DB01221 receptor activity . The P29323 MAPK signalling pathway is a highly conserved kinase cascade linking transmembrane receptors to downstream effector mechanisms . To investigate the function of P29323 in neurons , a constitutively active form of Q02750 ( caMEK1 ) was conditionally expressed in the murine brain , which resulted in P29323 activation and caused spontaneous epileptic seizures . P29323 activation stimulated phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( P06730 ) and augmented DB01221 receptor 2B ( Q13224 ) protein levels . Pharmacological inhibition of Q13224 function impaired synaptic facilitation in area cornus ammonicus region 3 ( P07451 ) in acute hippocampal slices derived from caMEK1-expressing mice and abrogated epilepsy in vivo . In addition , expression of caMEK1 caused phosphorylation of the transcription factor , DB02527 response element-binding protein ( CREB ) and increased transcription of ephrinB2 . EphrinB2 overexpression resulted in increased Q13224 tyrosine phosphorylation , which was essential for caMEK1-induced epilepsy in vivo , since conditional inactivation of ephrinB2 greatly reduced seizure frequency in caMEK1 transgenic mice . Therefore , our study identifies a mechanism of epileptogenesis that links Q96HU1 kinase to Eph/Ephrin and DB01221 receptor signalling .
