Pubertal maturation is associated with an increase in the number of androgen receptor-immunoreactive cells in the brains of male ferrets . P10275 -immunoreactive ( AR-IR ) cells were identified in brains of male ferrets before and after the onset of pubertal maturation . There was a greater number of AR-IR cells after the onset of pubertal maturation in some , but not all , brain regions examined . Regions in which the number of AR-IR cells increased included the preoptic area and the amygdala , areas known to be involved in the control of male reproductive behaviors . The mechanisms responsible for the increase in AR-IR cells are unknown , but might be related to the higher circulating levels of testosterone that were present in the older animals . DB00624 may increase androgen receptor ( AR ) immunoreactivity both by concentrating already existing ARs within the nucleus and by stimulating de novo synthesis of receptor protein .
