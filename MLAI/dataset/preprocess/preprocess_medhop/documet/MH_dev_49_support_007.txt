Dependence on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and DB01367 -RAF pathways drive the activity of RAF265 , a novel RAF/ P35968 inhibitor , and RAD001 ( DB01590 ) in combination . Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) -AKT and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue ( P01116 ) can induce cellular immortalization , proliferation , and resistance to anticancer therapeutics such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors or chemotherapy . This study assessed the consequences of inhibiting these two pathways in tumor cells with activation of P01116 , PI3K-AKT , or both . We investigated whether the combination of a novel RAF/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor , RAF265 , with a mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitor , RAD001 ( everolimus ) , could lead to enhanced antitumoral effects in vitro and in vivo . To address this question , we used cell lines with different status regarding P01116 , P42336 , and P15056 mutations , using immunoblotting to evaluate the inhibitors , and MTT and clonogenic assays for effects on cell viability and proliferation . Subcutaneous xenografts were used to assess the activity of the combination in vivo . RAD001 inhibited P42345 downstream signaling in all cell lines , whereas RAF265 inhibited RAF downstream signaling only in P15056 mutant cells . In vitro , addition of RAF265 to RAD001 led to decreased AKT , S6 , and P06730 binding protein 1 phosphorylation in HCT116 cells . In vitro and in vivo , RAD001 addition enhanced the antitumoral effect of RAF265 in HCT116 and H460 cells ( both P01116 mut , P42336 mut ) ; in contrast , the combination of RAF265 and RAD001 yielded no additional activity in A549 and MDAMB231 cells . The combination of RAF and P42345 inhibitors is effective for enhancing antitumoral effects in cells with deregulation of both DB01367 -RAF and PI3K , possibly through the cross-inhibition of 4E binding protein 1 and S6 protein .
