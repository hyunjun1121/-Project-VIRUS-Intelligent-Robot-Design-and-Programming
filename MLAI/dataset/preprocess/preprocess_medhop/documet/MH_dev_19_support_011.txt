Integrin αvβ3 and P16070 pathways in metastatic prostate cancer cells support osteoclastogenesis via a Runx2/Smad 5/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand signaling axis . BACKGROUND : Bone loss and pathological fractures are common skeletal complications associated with androgen deprivation therapy and bone metastases in prostate cancer patients . We have previously demonstrated that prostate cancer cells secrete receptor activator of NF-kB ligand ( O14788 ) , a protein essential for osteoclast differentiation and activation . However , the mechanism(s) by which O14788 is produced remains to be determined . The objective of this study is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling O14788 expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells . RESULTS : We show here that phosphorylation of Smad 5 by integrin αvβ3 and Q13950 by P16070 signaling , respectively , regulates O14788 expression in human-derived PC3 prostate cancer cells isolated from bone metastasis . We found that Q13950 intranuclear targeting is mediated by phosphorylation of Smad 5 . Indeed , Q99717 knock-down via RNA interference and inhibition of Smad 5 phosphorylation by an αv inhibitor reduced Q13950 nuclear localization and O14788 expression . Similarly , knockdown of P16070 or Q13950 attenuated the expression of O14788 . As a result , conditioned media from these cells failed to support osteoclast differentiation in vitro . Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray sections containing primary prostatic tumor ( grade2-4 ) detected predominant localization of Q13950 and phosphorylated Smad 5 in the nuclei . Immunoblotting analyses of nuclear lysates from prostate tumor tissue corroborate these observations . CONCLUSIONS : Collectively , we show that P16070 signaling regulates phosphorylation of Q13950 . Localization of Q13950 in the nucleus requires phosphorylation of Smad-5 by integrin αvβ3 signaling . Our results suggest possible integration of two different pathways in the expression of O14788 . These observations imply a novel mechanistic insight into the role of these proteins in bone loss associated with bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer .
