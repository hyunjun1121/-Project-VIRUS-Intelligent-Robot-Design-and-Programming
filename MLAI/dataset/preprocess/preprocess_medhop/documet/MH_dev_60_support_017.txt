5-Lipoxygenase mediates O14788 -induced osteoclast formation via the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 . 5-Lipoxygenase ( P09917 ) catalyzes the formation of two major groups of leukotrienes , leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLTs ) , and it has been implicated as a promising drug target to treat various inflammatory diseases . However , its role in osteoclastogenesis has not been investigated . In this study , we used mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMMs ) to show that P09917 inhibitor suppresses O14788 -induced osteoclast formation . Inhibition of P09917 was associated with impaired activation of multiple signaling events downstream of Q9Y6Q6 , including P29323 and p38 phosphorylation , and IÎºB degradation , followed by a decrease in O95644 expression . Ectopic overexpression of a constitutively active form of O95644 partly rescued the antiosteoclastogenic effect of P09917 inhibitor . The knockdown of P09917 in BMMs also resulted in a significant reduction in O14788 -induced osteoclast formation , accompanied by decreased expression of O95644 . Similar effects were shown with CysLT receptor (CysLTR)1/2 antagonist and small RNA for Q9Y271 in BMMs , indicating the involvement of CysLT and Q9Y271 in P09917 -mediated osteoclastogenesis . Finally , P09917 inhibitor suppressed LPS-induced osteoclast formation and bone loss in the in vivo mouse experiments , suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for treating diseases involving bone destruction . Taken together , the results of this study demonstrate that P09917 is a key mediator of O14788 -induced osteoclast formation and possibly a novel therapeutic target for bone-resorption diseases .
