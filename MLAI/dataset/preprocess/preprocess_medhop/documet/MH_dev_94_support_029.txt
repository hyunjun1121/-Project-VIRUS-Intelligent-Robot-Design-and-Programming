Angiotensin II and basic fibroblast growth factor mitogenic pathways in human fetal mesangial cells . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 / P09038 ) play relevant roles in renal development . Since the signaling pathways modulating the mitogenic effects of Ang II and P09038 in human fetal mesangial cells ( HFMc ) are not clearly defined , we carried out experiments to determine whether they would exert their mitogenic effects by modulating the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) [ extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 ( P28482 ) ] and DB02527 signaling pathways . In confluent HFMc , P09038 ( 20 ng/mL ) induced a significant 4-fold increase in P28482 activity and [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation ( 6-fold ) . In contrast , under similar tissue culture conditions , Ang II ( 10(-6) M ) induced a more modest increase in P28482 activity ( 2-fold ) and [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation ( 35 +/- 4 % ) . The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 ( MEK-1 ) inhibitor PD098059 ( 25 microM ) almost completely abolished the P09038 -induced proliferation in HFMc but did not significantly affect Ang II proliferative effects . In the presence of the DB02527 elevating agent isoproterenol , Ang II and P09038 induced opposite changes in DB02527 accumulation and cell growth . DB01064 inhibited the basal and P09038 -induced proliferation of HFMc through a MEK-1/2-independent pathway that included the accumulation of DB02527 . In contrast , isoproterenol increased Ang II mitogenic effects in correlation with a reduction in DB02527 accumulation . We conclude that Ang II and P09038 modulate the proliferation of HFMc through the stimulation of different MEK-1/2-dependent and independent signaling pathways . Activation of MEK-1/2 is required but not sufficient for mitogenesis in HFMc . The accumulation of DB02527 in HFMc counteracts the mitogenic effects of P09038 by a MEK-1/2-independent pathway .
