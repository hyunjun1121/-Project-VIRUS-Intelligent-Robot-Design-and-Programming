P43119 /thromboxane receptor interactions and cellular responses in human atherothrombotic disease . Twenty-five years have passed since Vane and colleagues proposed a prostacyclin and thromboxane balance as critical to cardiovascular homeostasis . DB01240 prevents platelet aggregation and promotes vasodilatation , opposing the effects of thromboxane . Possible compensation by redundant functions , such as nitric oxide , long prevented appreciation of this balance . Effective use of low-dose aspirin in the secondary prevention of atherothrombosis suggested a clinical importance for the balance . However , it was not until the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was withdrawn because of increased cardiovascular events that this critical balance was confirmed in humans . Moreover , clinical observations are supported by elegant animal receptor knockout experiments and subsequent human genetic variant studies . Combined , these findings provide valuable insight into the roles of these prostanoids in the development of atherothrombosis , emphasizing the need to reevaluate the use of selective prostacyclin- and thromboxane-based therapies in cardiovascular disease .
