DB06693 can cause P55008 arrest and induce apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through a P46527 -independent pathway . Advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by extensive vascular remodeling that is usually resistant to vasodilator therapy . DB06693 is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , the rate-limiting step for cholesterol synthesis . P04035 inhibitors have been shown to upregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P46527 and to block cell proliferation through cholesterol-independent pathways . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mevastatin on DNA synthesis , cell cycle progression , and cell proliferation in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) . We found that mevastatin induced P55008 arrest and decreased DNA synthesis in rat PASMCs and did so in association with an increase in both total and cyclin E-bound P46527 . This caused a marked decrease in cyclin E kinase activity , which suggests an important role for P46527 in the ability of mevastatin to induce P55008 arrest . However , in PASMCs lacking functional P46527 , mevastatin still decreased cyclin E kinase activity , caused P55008 arrest , and decreased DNA synthesis . In P46527 -deficient PASMCs , mevastatin induced a greater reduction of cyclin E protein levels ( to 35 % of control ) than in wild-type cells ( to 70 % of control ) and also reduced the phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160 . DB06693 also caused apoptosis in both wild-type and P46527 -deficient PASMCs and was able to do so at a dose that did not induce cell cycle arrest . These data suggest that P04035 inhibitors can both inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in PASMCs through P46527 -independent pathways and may be important therapeutic agents in pulmonary arterial hypertension .
