Pharmacologic attenuation of pelvic pain in a murine model of interstitial cystitis . BACKGROUND : Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) is a bladder disease that causes debilitating pelvic pain of unknown origin , and IC/PBS symptoms correlate with elevated bladder lamina propria mast cell counts . Similar to IC/PBS patients , pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) infection in mice induces a neurogenic cystitis associated with bladder lamina propria mast cell accumulation and pelvic pain . We evaluated several drugs to determine the effectiveness of reducing PRV-induced pelvic pain . METHODS : Neurogenic cystitis was induced by the injection of Bartha 's strain of PRV into the abductor caudalis dorsalis tail base muscle of female C57BL/6 mice . Therapeutic modulation of pelvic pain was assessed daily for five days using von Frey filament stimulation to the pelvic region to quantify tactile allodynia . RESULTS : Significant reduction of PRV-induced pelvic pain was observed for animals treated with antagonists of neurokinin receptor 1 ( P25103 ) and histamine receptors . In contrast , the P35367 antagonist hydroxyzine , proton pump inhibitors , a histamine receptor 3 agonist , and gabapentin had little or no effect on PRV-induced pelvic pain . CONCLUSION : These data demonstrate that bladder-associated pelvic pain is attenuated by antagonists of P25103 and P25021 . Therefore , P25103 and P25021 represent direct therapeutic targets for pain in IC/PBS and potentially other chronic pain conditions .
