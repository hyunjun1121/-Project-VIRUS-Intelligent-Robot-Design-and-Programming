Long-term fluoxetine , but not desipramine , inhibits the DB01285 and oxytocin responses to the P08908 agonist , 8-OH-DPAT , in male rats . The present studies determined whether serotonin P08908 receptor-mediated function is modified by chronic exposure to antidepressants . Hormone responses to the P08908 agonist , 8-OH-DPAT , were evaluated after long-term exposure to two antidepressants , the 5-HT uptake blocker , fluoxetine , and the norepinephrine uptake blocker , desipramine ( DB01151 ) . In addition , the density and affinity of P08908 receptors in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex were measured . Male rats received fluoxetine ( 10 mg/kg i.p. ) , DB01151 ( 5 mg/kg i.p. ) or saline injections once daily for 21 days . 8-OH-DPAT ( 0-500 micrograms/kg s.c. ) was administered 18 h after the final antidepressant injection and 15 min before sacrifice . 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased plasma DB01285 , corticosterone , oxytocin and prolactin , but not renin or vasopressin concentrations . Chronic injections of fluoxetine inhibited the DB01285 , corticosterone and oxytocin responses to 8-OH-DPAT , suggesting reduced P08908 receptor function . In contrast , chronic DB01151 did not alter the hormone responses to 8-OH-DPAT . The density and affinity of P08908 receptors in the frontal cortex or hypothalamus were not altered by either fluoxetine or DB01151 . To verify that the observed effects require prolonged exposure to fluoxetine , rats received a single injection of fluoxetine ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) , 3 h before 8-OH-DPAT ( 0-500 micrograms/kg s.c. ) . Acute fluoxetine did not reduce any of the hormone responses to 8-OH-DPAT . In conclusion , the results suggest that chronic , but not acute , exposure to fluoxetine decreases P08908 receptor function . This effect is not seen in rats chronically exposed to DB01151 .
