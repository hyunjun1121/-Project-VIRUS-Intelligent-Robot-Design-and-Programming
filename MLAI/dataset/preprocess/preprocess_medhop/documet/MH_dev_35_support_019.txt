Genetic expression profiles and chromosomal alterations in sporadic breast cancer in Mexican women . Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among Mexican women > 35 years of age . At the molecular level , changes in many genetic pathways have been reported to be associated with this neoplasm . To analyze these changes , we determined gene expression profiles and chromosomal structural alterations in tumors from Mexican women . We obtained mRNA to identify expression profiles with microarray technology , and DNA to determine amplifications and deletions , in 10 fresh sporadic breast tumor biopsies without treatment , as well as in 10 nonaffected breast tissues . Expression profiles were compared with genetic changes observed by comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . We compared the expression profiles against the structural alterations from the studied genes by means of microarrays ; at least 17 of these genes correlated with DNA copy number alterations . We found that the following genes were overexpressed : P11047 , Q07002 , P24863 , P24385 , P11487 , Q00537 , L1CAM , P21810 , and Q9ULL4 ( alias PLEXR ) . Underexpressed genes included P55211 , P09769 , O15350 , P98160 , and P07992 ; genes turned off included P42345 , P29317 ( previously P29317 ) , P29459 , Q15329 , O14763 , O00220 , Q15768 , and P10415 . The results will allow us , in the near future , to outline genes that could serve as diagnostic , prognostic , or target therapy markers for the Mexican population .
