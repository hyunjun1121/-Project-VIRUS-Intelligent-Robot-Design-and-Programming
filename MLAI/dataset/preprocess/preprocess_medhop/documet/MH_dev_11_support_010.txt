Effects of Luteolin on Liver , Kidney and Brain in Pentylentetrazol-Induced Seizures : Involvement of Metalloproteinases and NOS Activities . OBJECTIVE : Flavonoids are an important group of recognized antioxidants in plants . Luteolin ( LUT ) is a natural flavonoid in the plant kingdom . This study was aimed to investigate the effects of the LUT in the liver , kidney and brain of pentylentetrazol ( PTZ ) -induced seizure and the relationship between nitric oxide synthases ( P35228 , P29474 ) and matrix metalloproteinases ( P08253 , P14780 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : LUT ( 10 mg/kg ) was given intraperitoneally during two weeks prior to seizure induction . A single dose PTZ 80 mg/kg i.p. was administered and seizures were observed and evaluated with regard to latency , frequency and stage for one hour . RESULTS : Seizure frequen cy after PTZ administration was significantly decreased in LUT pretreated rats ( p < 0.05 ) . An increase of immunhistochemical reactions of P35228 and P08253 , but a decrease of P29474 activity , were observed in rat hippocampus and peripheral tissues during the PTZ induced seizures . LUT pretreatment reversed the P35228 and P08253 activity to the control levels and significantly increased the P29474 activity ( p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : LUT seems to have an effective role in reducing the seizure frequency and a protective role on peripheral organ injury in animal models of seizure . The protective effect of LUT in seizures and the seizure induced peripheral tissue damage warrant further investigations .
