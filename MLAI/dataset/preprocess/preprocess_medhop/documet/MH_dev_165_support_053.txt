P01308 / P05019 signaling pathways enhances tumor cell invasion through bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans modulation . an interplay with P12830 . Changes in glycosylation are considered a hallmark of cancer , and one of the key targets of glycosylation modifications is P12830 . We and others have previously demonstrated that P12830 has a role in the regulation of bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans expression , remaining to be determined the P12830 -dependent signaling pathway involved in this N-glycans expression regulation . In this study , we analysed the impact of P12830 expression in the activation profile of receptor tyrosine kinases such as insulin receptor ( IR ) and P08069 ( IGF-IR ) . We demonstrated that exogenous P12830 expression inhibits IR , IGF-IR and P29323 1/2 phosphorylation . Stimulation with insulin and P05019 in MDA-MD-435 cancer cells overexpressing P12830 induces a decrease of bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans that was accompanied with alterations on P12830 cellular localization . Concomitantly , IR/IGF-IR signaling activation induced a mesenchymal-like phenotype of cancer cells together with an increased tumor cell invasion capability . Altogether , these results demonstrate an interplay between P12830 and IR/IGF-IR signaling as major networking players in the regulation of bisecting N-glycans expression , with important effects in the modulation of epithelial characteristics and tumor cell invasion . Here we provide new insights into the role that P01308 / P05019 signaling play during cancer progression through glycosylation modifications .
