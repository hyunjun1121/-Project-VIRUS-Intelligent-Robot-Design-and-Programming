Protein kinase Cdelta and calmodulin regulate epidermal growth factor receptor recycling from early endosomes through Arp2/3 complex and cortactin . The intracellular trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is regulated by a cross-talk between calmodulin ( P62158 ) and protein kinase Cdelta ( PKCdelta ) . On inhibition of P62158 , PKCdelta promotes the formation of enlarged early endosomes and blocks P00533 recycling and degradation . Here , we show that PKCdelta impairs P00533 trafficking due to the formation of an F-actin coat surrounding early endosomes . The PKCdelta-induced polymerization of actin is orchestrated by the Arp2/3 complex and requires the interaction of cortactin with PKCdelta . Accordingly , inhibition of actin polymerization by using cytochalasin D or by overexpression of active cofilin , restored the normal morphology of the organelle and the recycling of P00533 . Similar results were obtained after down-regulation of cortactin and the sequestration of the Arp2/3 complex . Furthermore we demonstrate an interaction of cortactin with P62158 and PKCdelta , the latter being dependent on P62158 inhibition . In summary , this study provides the first evidence that P62158 and PKCdelta organize actin dynamics in the early endosomal compartment , thereby regulating the intracellular trafficking of P00533 .
