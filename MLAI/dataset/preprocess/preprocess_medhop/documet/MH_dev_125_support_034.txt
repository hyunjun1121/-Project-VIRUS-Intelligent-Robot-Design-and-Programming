Intrahypothalamic perfusion with interleukin-1-beta stimulates the local release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin and the plasma adrenocorticotropin in freely moving rats : a comparative perfusion of the paraventricular nucleus and the median eminence . It is almost generally accepted that an acute-phase DB01285 response induced by interleukin ( IL ) -1 is mediated principally by P06850 release from the hypothalamus . However , the precise cellular site of action of IL-1 in activating the P06850 neuronal system remains to be determined . Two likely candidates comprise the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) where P06850 neuronal cell bodies are located , and the median eminence ( ME ) where their nerve endings are terminated . Therefore , in this study we performed a comparative perfusion of the ME and the PVN with increasing concentrations of recombinant human P01584 utilizing the push-pull perfusion technique in freely moving rats . We measured the plasma DB01285 and ME and PVN levels of P06850 , and also of AVP , because AVP , another secretagogue of DB01285 , has its cell body in the PVN and axon terminals partly in the ME . In control groups , the ME or the PVN was perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid between 12:00 and 15:00 h , and perfusates and blood samples were collected every 20 min . In the other groups , either the ME or the PVN was perfused with three increasing concentrations ( 0.1 , 1.0 , and 10 nM ) of recombinant human P01584 dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid only between 13:00 and 14:00 h with all the other procedures run in the same way as in the controls . In the control perfusions , the hypothalamic release of P06850 and AVP and the plasma DB01285 did not change significantly during the entire period of observation. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
