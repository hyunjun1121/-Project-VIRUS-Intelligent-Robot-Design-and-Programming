[ Studies on antigenspecific immunosuppression : Influence of 6-mercaptopurine-BGG-conjugates on BGG binding cells ( author 's transl ) ] . The rosette forming cell ( P41440 ) response of different lymphoid organs ( spleen , lymph node , peripheral blood ) of guinea pigs was examined by immunocytoadherence . The method has been adapted to work with the soluble antigen BGG . The number of antigen binding cells following immunization with BGG in O75347 reached the highest level on day 6 in Ln. popliteus and on the 10th day in spleen and peripheral blood . It is shown that the highest level of antigen binding cells appears generally before the maximum of circulating antibodies . After i.p.-immunization to alum-adsorbed BGG we only detected a small number of RFCs . After pretreatment with 6-mercaptopurineI-25-BGG ( MP-BGG ) and a control substance ( toluylI-25-BGG ) over 8 days and in increasing doses we obtained an antigenspecific suppression of BGG binding cells following MP-BGG treatment . In contrast to these findings the antibody titres were only slightly decreased in the beginning of the immune response .
