Subclones with the t(9;22)/ P11274 - P00519 rearrangement occur in AML and seem to cooperate with distinct genetic alterations . In AML , cooperation of mutations suppressing differentiation ( ' class-II-mutations ' ) with ' class-I-mutations ' increasing cell proliferation is frequent . In rare cases of myeloid malignancies , the P11274 - P00519 fusion was reported to cooperate as class-I-mutation with class-II-mutations , but most cases had to be classified as blast phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . We identified five cases of Philadelphia positive subclones in AML occurring in coincidence with other genetic lesions : 1:220 patients with inv(16)/ Q13951 - P35749 ( 0·5 % ) , 2:272 AML cases with t(8;21)/ Q01196 - Q06455 ( 0·7 % ) , 1:1029 P06748 -mutated AML ( 0·1 % ) , and one patient with s-AML following P43034 with a 5q-deletion . Four patients had m- P11274 ( e1a2 ) P11274 - P00519 transcripts ; one case only had an M- P11274 ( b3a2 ) breakpoint . These cases allow some interesting conclusions : The P11274 - P00519 rearrangement apparently can cooperate with the P06748 mutation similar to other class-I-mutations . The identification of Philadelphia positive subclones in < 1 % of patients with Q03701 -leukaemias fits well with previous observations that most Q03701 -AML are accompanied by activating mutations in genes enhancing proliferation . Since we observed the occurrence of the Philadelphia positive subclones at diagnosis , at relapse , or throughout the disease , the time point of the emergence of Philadelphia subclones seems variable in AML . Clinical research should further concentrate on Philadelphia positive subclones in AML to assess the clinical impact .
