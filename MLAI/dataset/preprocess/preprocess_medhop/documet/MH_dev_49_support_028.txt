BMP receptor-integrin interaction mediates responses of vascular endothelial Q15797 /5 and proliferation to disturbed flow . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial cells ( ECs ) are constantly exposed to blood flow-induced shear stress . Our previous study demonstrated that disturbed flow with low and oscillatory shear stress ( OSS ) induces bone morphogenetic protein receptor ( BMPR ) -specific Q15797 /5 activation in ECs , but the underlying mechanisms and the in vivo functional role of Q15797 /5 remain unclear . OBJECTIVES : Here we elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which OSS activates EC Q15797 /5 and its in vivo functional role . METHODS : Lentiviral Q99717 -specific short hairpin RNA ( Lenti-shSmad5 ) was constructed and intra-arterially injected into the lumen of stenosed abdominal aorta in bromodeoxyuridine-infused rats . Co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays were performed on ECs exposed to OSS ( 0.5 ± 4 dynes/cm(2) ) in a parallel-plate flow chamber to investigate BMPR-integrin interactions and their regulatory role in OSS-activation of EC Q15797 /5 . RESULTS : Intra-arterial administration of Lenti-shSmad5 inhibited bromodeoxyuridine uptake of ECs at post-stenotic sites , where disturbed flow with OSS occurs . OSS induced sustained BMPRIB-αv β3 integrin association in ECs , which was mediated by the intracytoplasmic kinase domain of BMPRII and subsequently activated the Shc/focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) /extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) cascade , leading to Q15797 /5 activation . This OSS-activation of Q15797 /5 induced its association with and activation of runt-related transcription factor-2 ( Runx2 ) , leading to activations of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) and p70S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , a pathway critical for EC proliferation in response to OSS . CONCLUSIONS : Oscillatory shear stress induces synergistic interactions between specific BMPRs and integrin to activate Q15797 /5 through the Shc/ Q05397 / P29323 pathway , which leads to the activation of the Runx2/ P42345 /p70S6K pathway to promote EC proliferation .
