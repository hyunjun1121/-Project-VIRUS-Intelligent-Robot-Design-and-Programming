Cyanidin-3-glucoside suppresses cytokine-induced inflammatory response in human intestinal cells : comparison with DB00244 . The potential use of polyphenols in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases has been extensively investigated although the mechanisms involved in cellular signaling need to be further elucidated . Cyanidin-3-glucoside is a typical anthocyanin of many pigmented fruits and vegetables widespread in the human diet . In the present study , the protection afforded by cyanidin-3-glucoside against cytokine-triggered inflammatory response was evaluated in the human intestinal HT-29 cell line , in comparison with DB00244 , a well-established anti-inflammatory drug , used in inflammatory bowel disease . For this purpose , some key inflammatory mediators and inflammatory enzymes were examined . Our data showed that cyanidin-3-glucoside reduced cytokine-induced inflammation in intestinal cells , in terms of NO , DB00917 and P10145 production and of P35228 and P35354 expressions , at a much lower concentration than DB00244 , suggesting a higher anti-inflammatory efficiency . Interestingly , cyanidin-3-glucoside and DB00244 neither prevented IkB-Î± degradation nor the activation of NF-kB , but significantly reduced cytokine-induced levels of activated P42224 accumulated in the cell nucleus . In addition , we established that phosphorylated p38 MAPK was not involved in the protective effect of cyanidin-3-glucoside or DB00244 . Taking into account the high concentrations of dietary anthocyanins potentially reached in the gastrointestinal tract , cyanidin-3-glucoside may be envisaged as a promising nutraceutical giving complementary benefits in the context of inflammatory bowel disease .
