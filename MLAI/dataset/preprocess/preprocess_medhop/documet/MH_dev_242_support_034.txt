Characterization of 5- Q13049 receptor desensitization and the effect of cycloheximide on it in P13671 cells . Effect of prolonged pretreatment with serotonin ( 5-HT ) on 5- Q13049 receptor desensitization was examined by the measurement of intracellular calcium ( [Ca2+]i ) mobilization in P13671 cells . 5-HT-induced desensitization of [Ca2+]i mobilization was in a time and dose dependent manner and reached a plateau after 3 hr . After 1 and 3 hr 5-HT pretreatment , 5-HT concentration in the medium little changed . 5-HT pretreatment with cycloheximide , a protein synthesis inhibitor , produced an enhancement of the desensitization for 3 and 6 hr pretreatment . However , 5-HT pretreatment for 3 and 6 hr caused no marked change in the 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA level or Galphaq/11 protein in this study , suggesting that 5-HT may decrease 5-HT-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization independent of 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA or G-proteins . P05305 -induced [Ca2+]i mobilization did not alter after 5-HT and/or cycloheximide pretreatment . These results showed that activation of the 5- Q13049 receptor induced homologous desensitization and pretreatment with 5-HT and/or cycloheximide did not change the efficacy of the second messenger pathway from Gq to a [Ca2+]i rise .
