Neuropeptide Y selectively inhibits slow synaptic potentials in rat dorsal raphe nucleus in vitro by a presynaptic action . Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) has been shown to modulate synaptic transmission in both peripheral and central tissues via both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms . In this study , we examined the effect of P01303 and its analog , peptide YY ( P10082 ) , on slow synaptic potentials in the dorsal raphe nucleus in vitro using intracellular recording and single-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques . P01303 and P10082 inhibited both the slow P08908 receptor-mediated IPSP and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated slow EPSP while not affecting the fast , amino acid-mediated synaptic responses . P10082 also inhibited pharmacologically isolated slow synaptic responses . P01303 / P10082 appear to mediate the observed inhibitions via a presynaptic mechanism , as the postsynaptic conductances mediated by activation of P08908 receptors or alpha 1-adrenoceptors were unaffected by the peptides . P01303 / P10082 act via a different mechanism than presynaptic P28222 receptors . P01303 / P10082 probably act via presynaptic P28062 receptors , as the C-terminal fragment P01303 13-36 and the P28062 -selective agonist P06681 - P01303 are effective . Since P01303 and its receptors are present in the dorsal raphe nucleus , this peptide may act as an endogenous modulator of the state of activity of neurons in this region and may thus have a role in the modulation of neuronal output from this nucleus .
