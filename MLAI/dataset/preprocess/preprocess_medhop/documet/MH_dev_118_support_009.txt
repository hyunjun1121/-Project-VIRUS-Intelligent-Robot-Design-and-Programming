Preparation and characterization of RGD tumour-homing-peptide-modified plasminogen P13647 . P00747 P13647 ( kringle 5 ) has strong inhibitory effects on endothelial-cell proliferation and migration . It was reported that P13647 can reduce tumour neovascularization , resulting in clinically relevant antitumour effects . To determine whether addition of a tumour-targeting peptide could improve the tumour homing and antitumour activities of P13647 , we genetically modified P13647 with an RGD ( DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 ) motif , which is a ligand with high affinity for αvβ₃ and αvβ₅ integrins . The fusion protein RGD- P13647 was expressed in the Pichia pastoris system and the biological activity of RGD- P13647 was assessed in vitro and in vivo . The results showed that the RGD- P13647 exhibited a more potent effect of inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and migration compared with that of traditional P13647 . RGD- P13647 also displayed stronger anti-angiogenic activity in a P62158 ( chick chorioallantoic membrane ) assay . Furthermore , RGD- P13647 also showed stronger anti-angiogenic and antitumour effects in B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice compared with traditional P13647 . In conclusion , the biological activity of P13647 can be further improved by the addition of a tumour-homing peptide , and the RGD- P13647 may prove to be a promising novel candidate for cancer therapy .
