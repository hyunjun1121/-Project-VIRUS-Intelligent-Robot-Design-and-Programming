Toxicity of sorafenib : clinical and molecular aspects . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : DB00398 is a novel oral bis-aryl urea compound originally developed as an inhibitor of RAF kinase for its anti-proliferative property . DB00398 also inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as P17948 /2/3 , Flt-3 and P09619 . The combination of both its anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties makes sorafenib an attractive agent in cancer treatment . DB00398 has been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma as well as hepatocellular cancer . Despite its inherent selectivity , sorafenib can cause unusual adverse events whose the management represents a challenge for oncologists . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : Relevant literature was identified using a Pubmed search of articles published up to June 2009 . Search terms included ' sorafenib ' and ' toxicity ' . Original articles were reviewed and relevant citations from these articles were also considered . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : The clinical aspect of sorafenib-induced adverse events and the molecular basis behind this toxicity are discussed . Finally , recommendations for the management of these adverse events are proposed . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : Although not life-threatening , toxicity of sorafenib can severely impact the physical , psychological and social well-being of patients . The management of this unusual toxicity highlights the particular need of new pluridisciplinarities linking oncologist , cardiologist and dermatologist .
