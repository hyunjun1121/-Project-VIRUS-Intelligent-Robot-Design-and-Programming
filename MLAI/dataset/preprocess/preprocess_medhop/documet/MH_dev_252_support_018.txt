P00747 activator inhibitor type 1 regulates microglial motility and phagocytic activity . BACKGROUND : P00747 activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) is the primary inhibitor of urokinase type plasminogen activators ( uPA ) and tissue type plasminogen activators ( tPA ) , which mediate fibrinolysis . P05121 is also involved in the innate immunity by regulating cell migration and phagocytosis . However , little is known about the role of P05121 in the central nervous system . METHODS : In this study , we identified P05121 in the culture medium of mouse mixed glial cells by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry . Secretion of P05121 from glial cultures was detected by ELISA and western blotting analysis . Cell migration was evaluated by in vitro scratch-wound healing assay or Boyden chamber assay and an in vivo stab wound injury model . Phagocytic activity was measured by uptake of zymosan particles . RESULTS : The levels of P05121 mRNA and protein expression were increased by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-Î³ stimulation in both microglia and astrocytes . P05121 promoted the migration of microglial cells in culture via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) 1/Janus kinase ( JAK ) /signal transducer and activator of transcription ( P35610 )1 axis . P05121 also increased microglial migration in vivo when injected into mouse brain . P05121 -mediated microglial migration was independent of protease inhibition , because an R346A mutant of P05121 with impaired PA inhibitory activity also promoted microglial migration . Moreover , P05121 was able to modulate microglial phagocytic activity . P05121 inhibited microglial engulfment of zymosan particles in a vitronectin- and O60603 /6-dependent manner . CONCLUSION : Our results indicate that glia-derived P05121 may regulate microglial migration and phagocytosis in an autocrine or paracrine manner . This may have important implications in the regulation of brain microglial activities in health and disease .
