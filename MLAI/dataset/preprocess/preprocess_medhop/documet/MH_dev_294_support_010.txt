Gipr is essential for adrenocortical steroidogenesis ; however , corticosterone deficiency does not mediate the favorable metabolic phenotype of Gipr(-/-) mice . P09681 ( GIP ) promotes glucose-dependent insulin secretion . However , GIP also enhances glucocorticoid secretion and promotes adiposity . Because obesity and diabetes are glucocorticoid dependent , we examined whether the effects of GIP on energy balance and glycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids using pharmacological activation of GIP receptor ( P48546 ) signaling with [d-Ala(2)]GIP in mice and in Q03519 adrenocortical cells . Genetic elimination of P48546 activity was also studied in normal- and high-fat ( HF ) -fed Gipr-deficient ( Gipr(-/-) ) mice . [d-Ala(2)]GIP increased murine corticosterone levels in a P48546 -dependent manner . Conversely , basal corticosterone levels were reduced , whereas food deprivation resulted in significantly enhanced plasma corticosterone levels in Gipr(-/-) mice . [d-Ala(2)]GIP increased DB02527 levels , activated extracellular signal\x{2013}related kinase ( P29323 )1/2 , increased expression of steroidogenic genes , and increased neutral lipid storage in Y1GIPR cells . Gipr(-/-) adrenal glands demonstrated a twofold upregulation of the Q01718 mRNA and increased sensitivity to DB01285 ex vivo . Although HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice exhibited significantly lower plasma corticosterone , glucocorticoid-treated HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice had similar energy balance and glycemia compared with Gipr(+)(/+) controls . Hence , although the Gipr is essential for adrenal steroidogenesis and links HF feeding to increased levels of corticosterone , reduced glucocorticoid levels do not significantly contribute to the enhanced metabolic phenotypes in HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice .
