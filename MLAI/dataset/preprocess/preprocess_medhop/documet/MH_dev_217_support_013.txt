P08183 , Q9UNQ0 , and P60484 determine the response of glioblastoma to temozolomide and ABT-888 therapy . PURPOSE : Little is known about the optimal clinical use of ABT-888 ( veliparib ) for treatment of glioblastoma . ABT-888 is a PARP inhibitor undergoing extensive clinical evaluation in glioblastoma , because it may synergize with the standard-of-care temozolomide ( DB00853 ) . We have elucidated important factors controlling ABT-888 efficacy in glioblastoma . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We used genetically engineered spontaneous glioblastoma mouse models and allograft models that were orthotopically transplanted into wild-type ( WT ) and Abcb1/Abcg2-deficient ( KO ) recipients . RESULTS : ABT-888/ DB00853 is not efficacious against p53;p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf);K-Ras(v12);LucR allografts in wild-type recipients , indicating inherent resistance . Abcb1/Abcg2 mediated efflux of ABT-888 at the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) causes a 5-fold reduction of ABT-888 brain penetration ( P < 0.0001 ) that was fully reversible by elacridar . Efficacy studies in WT and KO recipients and/or concomitant elacridar demonstrate that Abcb1/Abcg2 at the BBB and in tumor cells impair DB00853 /ABT-888 combination treatment efficacy . DB04881 also markedly improved DB00853 /ABT-888 combination treatment in the spontaneous p53;p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf);K-Ras(v12);LucR glioblastoma model . Importantly , ABT-888 does enhance DB00853 efficacy in Pten deficient glioblastoma allografts and spontaneous tumors , even in Abcb1/Abcg2 proficient wild-type mice . Loss of P60484 occurs frequently in glioblastoma ( 36 % ) and in silico analysis on patient with glioblastoma samples revealed that it is associated with a worse overall survival ( 310 days vs. 620 days , n = 117 ) . CONCLUSIONS : The potential of ABT-888 in glioblastoma can best be demonstrated in patients with P60484 null tumors . Therefore , clinical trials with ABT-888 should evaluate these patients as a separate group . Importantly , inhibition of P08183 and Q9UNQ0 ( by elacridar ) may improve the efficacy of DB00853 /ABT-888 therapy in all glioblastoma patients .
