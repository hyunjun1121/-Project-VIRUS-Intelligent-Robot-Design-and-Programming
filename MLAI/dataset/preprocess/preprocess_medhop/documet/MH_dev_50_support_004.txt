DCEBIO stimulates Cl- secretion in the mouse jejunum . We investigated the effects of 5,6-dichloro-1-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one(DCEBIO) on the Cl- secretory response of the mouse jejunum using the Ussing short-circuit current ( Isc ) technique . DCEBIO stimulated a concentration-dependent , sustained increase in Isc ( EC50 41 +/- 1 microM ) . Pretreating tissues with 0.25 microM forskolin reduced the concentration-dependent increase in Isc by DCEBIO and increased the EC50 ( 53 +/- 5 microM ) . DB00887 blocked ( 82 +/- 5 % ) the DCEBIO-stimulated Isc consistent with Cl- secretion . DCEBIO was a more potent stimulator of Cl- secretion than its parent molecule , 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone . DB01016 or P16860 reduced the DCEBIO-stimulated Isc by > 80 % indicating the participation of P13569 in the DCEBIO-stimulated Isc response . Clotrimazole reduced DCEBIO-stimulated Isc by 67 +/- 15 % , suggesting the participation of the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel ( IKCa ) in the DCEBIO-activated Isc response . In the presence of maximum forskolin ( 10 microM ) , the DCEBIO response was reduced and biphasic , reaching a peak response of the change in Isc of 43 +/- 5 microA/cm2 and then falling to a steady-state response of 17 +/- 10 microA/cm2 compared with DCEBIO control tissues ( 61 +/- 6 microA/cm2 ) . The forskolin-stimulated Isc in the presence of DCEBIO was reduced compared with forskolin control tissues . Similar results were observed with DCEBIO and 8-BrcAMP where adenylate cyclase was bypassed . H89 , a PKA inhibitor , reduced the DCEBIO-activated Isc , providing evidence that DCEBIO increased Cl- secretion via a DB02527 /PKA-dependent manner . These data suggest that DCEBIO stimulates Cl- secretion of the mouse jejunum and that DCEBIO targets components of the Cl- secretory mechanism .
