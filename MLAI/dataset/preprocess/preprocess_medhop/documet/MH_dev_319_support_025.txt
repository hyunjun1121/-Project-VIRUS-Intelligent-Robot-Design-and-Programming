Possible difference in frequencies of genetic polymorphisms of estrogen receptor alpha , estrogen metabolism and P04637 genes between estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancers . OBJECTIVE : Genetic polymorphisms associated with breast cancer risk are likely to differ among ethnic and molecular subtypes . The ability to identify genetic polymorphisms affecting the risk of estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive breast cancer may lead to the more efficient selection of candidates for chemoprevention with endocrine agents . We focused on identifying common genotypes for ER-positive breast cancer in premenopausal Japanese women . METHODS : We compared genetic polymorphisms of ERalpha , estrogen metabolism genes ( P05093 , P11511 , P14061 Q13057 , Q16678 and P21964 ) , and p53 between ER-positive and -negative female Japanese breast cancer patients , and analyzed whether these polymorphisms affected the frequency of ER-positive breast cancer . RESULTS : Carriers of the G allele of ERalpha ( rs6905370 ) were more frequent in ER-positive breast cancer than in ER-negative breast cancer especially in those under 50-year old . Pairwise analysis showed that combinations of the ERalpha G allele with the homozygous DB00150 genotype of P11511 codon 39 ( rs2236722 ) , the methionine ( DB00134 ) allele of P21964 codon 158 ( rs4680 ) or Pro allele of p53 codon 72 ( rs1042522 ) were more frequent in ER-positive than ER-negative breast cancer , especially in patients less than 50-year old . The frequencies of these combinations were even higher in patients with strongly ER-positive tumors ( Allred 's scores of 7 or 8 ) . CONCLUSION : Our study demonstrated genetic polymorphisms of ERalpha , P11511 , P21964 and p53 genes frequently occur in ER-positive breast cancer in premenopausal Japanese women .
