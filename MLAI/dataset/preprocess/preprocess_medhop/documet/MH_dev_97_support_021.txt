P10275 -induced tumor suppressor , B2CW77 , inhibits breast cancer growth and transcriptionally activates p53/p73-mediated apoptosis in breast carcinomas . P10275 ( AR ) expression by immunohistochemistry correlates with better prognosis and survival among breast cancer patients . We and others have shown that AR inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells . However , the mechanism of AR 's anti-tumor effect in breast cancer is still not fully understood . Our recent study indicates that AR upregulates expression of tumor suppressor gene P60484 by promoter activation in breast cancer . B2CW77 , encoding B2CW77 protein , is a newly identified gene , which shares a bidirectional promoter with P60484 and is transcribed in the opposite direction . So far , the function of B2CW77 has never been studied in tumorigenesis . Here , we define B2CW77 as a tumor suppressor in breast carcinomas , which inhibits tumor growth and invasiveness . After analyzing 188 normal breast and 1247 malignant breast cancer tissues , we observed the loss of B2CW77 in multiple breast cancer subtypes and this decreased B2CW77 expression associates with tumor progression and increasing histological grade in invasive carcinomas . We characterize B2CW77 , for the first time , as a transcription factor , directly promoting the expression of P04637 and O15350 , with consequent elevated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells . We demonstrate , in vitro and in murine xenograph models , that both B2CW77 and P60484 are AR-target genes , mediating androgen-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer cells . Our observations suggest that B2CW77 might be used as a potential prognostic marker and novel therapy target for breast carcinomas .
