Elevated retinol binding protein 4 induces apolipoprotein B production and associates with hypertriglyceridemia . CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE : A high level of retinol binding protein 4 ( P02753 ) is reported to be associated with insulin resistance in humans . However , evidence from large-scale populations about the relationship between serum P02753 and metabolic phenotypes is scarce . In the present study , we aimed to evaluate serum P02753 distribution and its association with metabolic phenotypes among middle-aged and elderly Chinese . DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS : Serum concentrations of P02753 in a cross-sectional sample of 2780 Chinese population aged 50-70 years old in Guangzhou were measured by ELISA . RESULTS : The mean of serum P02753 concentration was 28.04 μg/mL for male and 37.76 μg/mL for female ( P < .01 ) , respectively . Circulating P02753 was positively correlated with serum triglyceride and apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) concentrations . The odds ratio ( OR ) was substantially higher for hypertriglyceridemia ( OR , 3.26 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.36-4.51 ) in the highest P02753 quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile after multiple adjustment for confounders . Furthermore , serum P02753 was significantly associated with fasting glucose , insulin levels , and homeostasis model assessment index-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) . Moreover , we showed that P02753 enhanced microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) expression and activity via up-regulation of protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) , suppressed low-density lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) expression , and impaired insulin-signaling pathway , leading to inductions in apoB secretion both in vitro and in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : Elevated circulating P02753 concentrations were associated with higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia by inducing the secretion of triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins .
