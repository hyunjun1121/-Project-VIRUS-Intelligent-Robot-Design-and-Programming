Combining the P36888 inhibitor PKC412 and the triterpenoid CDDO-Me synergistically induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia with the internal tandem duplication mutation . Mutations of the P36888 receptor tyrosine kinase consisting of internal tandem duplications ( ITD ) have been detected in blasts from 20 % to 30 % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and are associated with a poor prognosis . P36888 /ITD results in constitutive autophosphorylation of the receptor and factor-independent survival in leukemia cell lines . The C-28 methyl ester of the oleane triterpenoid ( CDDO-Me ) is a multifunctional molecule that induces apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia cells . Here , we report that CDDO-Me blocks targeting of NFkappaB to the nucleus by inhibiting O15111 beta-mediated phosphorylation of P25963 . Moreover , CDDO-Me blocked constitutive activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 . We report the potent and selective antiproliferative effects of CDDO-Me on P36888 /ITD-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells . The present studies show that CDDO-Me treatment results in caspase-3-mediated induction of apoptosis of P36888 /ITD-expressing cells and its antiproliferative effects are synergistic with PKC412 , a P36888 -tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently in clinical trials . Taken together , our studies indicate that CDDO-Me greatly enhanced the efficacy of the P36888 inhibitor PKC412 , suggesting that combining two separate pathway inhibitors might be a viable therapeutic strategy for AML associated with a P36888 /ITD mutation .
