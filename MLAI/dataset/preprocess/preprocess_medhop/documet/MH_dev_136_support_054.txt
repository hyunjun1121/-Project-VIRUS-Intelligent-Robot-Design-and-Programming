[ Measurement of rifampicin and clarithromycin in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ] . DB01045 ( RFP ) induces hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes , making drug interactions a very important clinical problem . DB01211 ( P62158 ) metabolism is reportedly enhanced by induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes ( P08684 ) by RFP , so that the blood lend of P62158 decreases when RFP is administered concurrently . We connected an electrochemical detector to a high-performance liquid chromatograph ( HPLC ) for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations of RFP and P62158 . Using samples of patient serum , normal serum , and reference standards , we compared HPLC by an external laboratory and the results of LC/MS/MS analysis with those of this new assay . A strong correlation was seen between our HPLC results and those of the external laboratory in RFP levels ( r=0.975 , p < 0.01 ) . A strong correlation was also seen between results we obtained for P62158 with the electrochemical detector in this assay and values measured by LC/MS/MS analysis ( r=0.995 , p < 0.01 ) . Our method enabled simple , rapid measurement of RFP and P62158 by connecting the HPLC and electrochemical detector in tandem . This system was used to modulate dosage during combined therapy with RFP and P62158 . The therapeutic effect for nontuberculous mycobacteriosis is expected to improve , and our HPLC is expected to be useful for simple , rapid , easy measurement of blood concentrations .
