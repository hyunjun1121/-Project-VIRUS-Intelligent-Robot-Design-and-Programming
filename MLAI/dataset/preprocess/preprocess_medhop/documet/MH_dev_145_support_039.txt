Migration of Th1 lymphocytes is regulated by P16410 ( P16410 ) -mediated signaling via P19957 kinase-dependent Akt activation . Efficient adaptive immune responses require the localization of T lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs and inflamed tissues . To achieve correct localization of T lymphocytes , the migration of these cells is initiated and directed by adhesion molecules and chemokines . It has recently been shown that the inhibitory surface molecule P16410 ( P16410 ) initiates Th cell migration , but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated . Using P01730 T lymphocytes derived from OVA-specific TCR transgenic P16410 -deficient and P16410 -competent mice , we demonstrate that chemokine-triggered signal transduction is differentially regulated by P16410 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -dependent activation of protein kinase B ( P31749 /Akt ) . In the presence of P16410 signaling , the chemoattractant P13236 selectively induces the full activation of Akt via phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 in pro-inflammatory Th lymphocytes expressing the cognate chemokine receptor P51681 . Akt signals lead to cytoskeleton rearrangements , which are indispensable for migration . Therefore , this novel Akt-modulating function of P16410 signals affecting T cell migration demonstrates that boosting P16410 or its down-stream signal transduction could aid therapies aimed at sensitizing T lymphocytes for optimal migration , thus contributing to a precise and effective immune response .
