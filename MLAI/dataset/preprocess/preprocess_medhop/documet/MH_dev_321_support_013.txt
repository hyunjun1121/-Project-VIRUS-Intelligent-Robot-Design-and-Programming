Short-term biomarker modulation prevention study of anastrozole in women at increased risk for second primary breast cancer . The selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERM ) , Tamoxifen and raloxifen reduce risk breast cancer . Patient acceptance of SERMs for breast cancer prevention is low due to toxicities . New agents with a better toxicity profile are needed . P11511 inhibitors ( AI ) reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer and risk of new breast cancer in high risk women . However , the mechanism by which AIs reduce breast risk is not known . Surrogate biomarkers are needed to evaluate the effect of preventive agents . The objective of this prospective short-term prevention study was to evaluate the effect of anastrozole on biomarkers in breast tissue and serum of women at increased risk for developing a contralateral breast cancer . Women with a history of stage I , II breast cancer who started anastrozole for standard adjuvant treatment were eligible . Patients underwent baseline fine needle aspiration of the unaffected breast and serum collection for biomarker analysis before starting anastrozole at 1 mg per oral/day and again at 6 months . Biomarkers included changes in cytology , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( DB01277 ) , P08833 ( P08833 ) , and P17936 . Thirty-seven patients were enrolled . There was a significant modulation in serum P08833 levels between pre- and postsamples ( P = 0.02 ) . No change was observed in DB01277 , P17936 , and breast cytology.We showed a significant modulation of P08833 levels with six months anastrozole . DB01217 is currently being studied as a prevention agent in a large phase III trial and our results provide support for continued evaluation of P08833 as a surrogate endpoint biomarker in prospective breast chemoprevention studies .
