Augmented potassium current is a shared phenotype for two genetic defects associated with familial atrial fibrillation . Mutations in multiple genes have been implicated in familial atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , but the underlying mechanisms , and thus implications for therapy , remain ill-defined . Among 231 participants in the Vanderbilt AF Registry , we found a mutation in P51787 ( encoding the alpha-subunit of slow delayed rectifier potassium current [ I(Ks) ] ) and separately a mutation in natriuretic peptide precursor A ( P01160 ) gene ( encoding atrial natriuretic peptide , P01160 ) , both segregating with early onset lone AF in different kindreds . The functional effects of these mutations yielded strikingly similar I(Ks) " gain-of-function . " In Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , coexpression of mutant P51787 with its ancillary subunit P15382 generated approximately 3-fold larger currents that activated much faster than wild-type ( WT ) -I(Ks) . Application of the WT P01160 peptide fragment produced similar changes in WT-I(Ks) , and these were exaggerated with the mutant P01160 S64R peptide fragment . Anantin , a competitive P01160 receptor antagonist , completely inhibited the changes in I(Ks) gating observed with P01160 S64R . Computational simulations identified accelerated transitions into open states as the mechanism for variant I(Ks) gating . Incorporating these I(Ks) changes into computed human atrial action potentials ( AP ) resulted in 37 % shortening ( 120 vs. 192 ms at 300 ms cycle length ) , reflecting loss of the phase II dome which is dependent on L-type calcium channel current . We found striking functional similarities due to mutations in P51787 and P01160 genes which led to I(Ks) " gain-of-function " , atrial AP shortening , and consequently altered calcium current as a common mechanism between diverse familial AF syndromes .
