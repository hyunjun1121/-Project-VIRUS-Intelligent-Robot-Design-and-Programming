Differential gene expression in adipose tissue from obese human subjects during weight loss and weight maintenance . BACKGROUND : Differential gene expression in adipose tissue during diet-induced weight loss followed by a weight stability period is poorly characterized . Markers of these processes may provide a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms . OBJECTIVE : We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes in human adipose tissue during weight loss and weight maintenance after weight loss . DESIGN : RNA from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue from 9 obese subjects was analyzed by using a complementary DNA microarray at baseline after weight loss on a low-calorie diet and after weight maintenance . RESULTS : Subjects lost 18.8 ± 1.8 % of weight and maintained this loss during weight maintenance ( 1.1 ± 2.1 % ; range : -9.3 to 10.6 % ) . Most differentially expressed genes exhibited a reciprocal regulation and returned to baseline after weight loss ( 2163 genes ) and weight maintenance ( 3175 genes ) . P11597 and P45844 , both of which participate in the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) , were among the most upregulated of the 750 genes that were differentially expressed after both processes . Several genes involved in inflammation were downregulated . The use of real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed or partially confirmed the previously implicated genes Q9H2S6 and P14780 ( both downregulated ) , Q9NST1 ( upregulated ) , and O60543 and O00767 ( both reciprocally regulated ) . CONCLUSIONS : The beneficial effects of weight loss should be investigated after long-term weight maintenance . The processes of weight loss and weight maintenance should be viewed as biologically distinct . P11597 and P45844 may be important mediators of these effects through HDL-mediated RCT .
