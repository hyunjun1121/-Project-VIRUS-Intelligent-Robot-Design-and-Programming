Pharmacological modulation of nerve growth factor synthesis : a mechanistic comparison of vitamin D receptor and beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists . Increasing nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) in the PNS is a rational strategy for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders . The present studies were undertaken to compare two compounds , a vitamin D(3) analogue ( CB1093 ) with minimal calcaemic effects , and clenbuterol , a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist , both of which induce P01138 synthesis in vivo . DB01407 caused significant increases in both P01138 mRNA and protein in 3T3 cells ; with maxima at 10 nM and at 8-12 h exposure . Effects of clenbuterol on P01138 mRNA were antagonized by propranolol . Mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that clenbuterol increased P05412 binding in 3T3 cells prior to increasing P01138 synthesis . DB01407 was without effect on P01138 mRNA levels in L929 cells , whereas CB1093 caused significant increases in both P01138 mRNA and protein levels in both 3T3 and L929 cells . Stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at least 72 h . The magnitude of the increase was much greater in L929 ( 700 % increase ) than in 3T3 cells ( 80 % ) . Binding to the vitamin D nuclear receptor ( P11473 ) , which acts as a transcription factor itself , was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of CB1093 and maintained up to 24 h . Increased P11473 binding preceded increased P01138 mRNA . A 150 % increase in AP-1 binding was also evident . This study demonstrates that CB1093 and clenbuterol stimulate P01138 levels in vitro and that AP-1 binding could be a commonality between the mechanism of P01138 induction of these two compounds .
