Targeted therapy in gastric cancer . Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage . Although chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life , the survival of gastric cancer patients with advanced disease is short . Thanks to recent insights into the molecular pathways involved in gastric carcinogenesis , new targeted treatment options have become available for gastric cancer patients . DB00072 , an antibody targeted to HER-2 , was shown to improve survival of advanced gastric cancer patients harboring HER-2 overexpression due to gene amplification in their tumor cells , and is currently also explored in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings . Another agent with promising results in clinical trials is ramucirumab , an antibody targeting P35968 . No clear survival benefit , however , were experienced with agents targeting P00533 ( cetuximab , panitumumab ) , P15692 ( bevacizumab ) , or P42345 ( everolimus ) . Drugs targeting c-MET/ P14210 are currently under investigation in biomarker-selected cohorts , with promising results in early clinical trials . This review will summarize the current status of targeted treatment options in gastric cancer .
