Selective measurement of white matter and gray matter diffusion trace values in normal human brain . The trace of the diffusion tensor ( or simply the trace ) is diagnostically valuable for detecting acute ischemic lesions . A number of studies indicate that the trace of human gray matter ( GM ) and white matter ( WM ) are quite similar . This is somewhat surprising considering the different cellular environments of GM and WM . It is possible that partial volume averaging ( P32926 ) effects between GM and WM , inherent in many of the ultrafast imaging sequences used for diffusion measurements , are responsible for this observation . In order to minimize P32926 effects , the trace values of GM and WM have been selectively measured by implementing double inversion recovery ( P30518 ) echo planar imaging ( P10646 ) pulse sequences . Results on six normal volunteers indicate that the trace values of WM and GM are not statistically different .
