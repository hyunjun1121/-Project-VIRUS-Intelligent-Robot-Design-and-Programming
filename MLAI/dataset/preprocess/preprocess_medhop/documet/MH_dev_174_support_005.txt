Modulation of NMDAR subunit expression by O94759 channels regulates neuronal vulnerability to ischemic cell death . Neuronal vulnerability to ischemia is dependent on the balance between prosurvival and prodeath cellular signaling . In the latter , it is increasingly appreciated that toxic Ca(2+) influx can occur not only via postsynaptic glutamate receptors , but also through other cation conductances . One such conductance , the Transient receptor potential melastatin type-2 ( O94759 ) channel , is a nonspecific cation channel having homology to Q96QT4 , a conductance reported to play a key role in anoxic neuronal death . The role of O94759 conductances in ischemic Ca(2+) influx has been difficult to study because of the lack of specific modulators . Here we used O94759 -null mice ( O94759 (-/-) ) to study how O94759 may modulate neuronal vulnerability to ischemia . O94759 (-/-) mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion exhibited smaller infarcts when compared with wild-type animals , suggesting that the absence of O94759 is neuroprotective . Surprisingly , field potentials ( fEPSPs ) recorded during redox modulation in brain slices taken from O94759 (-/-) mice revealed increased excitability , a phenomenon normally associated with ischemic vulnerability , whereas wild-type fEPSPs were unaffected . The upregulation in fEPSP in O94759 (-/-) neurons was blocked selectively by a Q12879 antagonist . This increase in excitability of O94759 (-/-) fEPSPs during redox modulation depended on the upregulation and downregulation of Q12879 - and Q13224 -containing NMDARs , respectively , and on augmented prosurvival signaling via Akt and P29323 pathways culminating in the inhibition of the proapoptotic factor GSK3Î² . Our results suggest that O94759 plays a role in downregulating prosurvival signals in central neurons and that O94759 channels may comprise a therapeutic target for preventing ischemic damage .
