DB02342 in the human corpus luteum throughout the luteal phase and its influence on lutein cell steroidogenesis and angiogenic activity . OBJECTIVE : To quantitate 2-methoxyestradiol ( 2-ME ) in human corpus luteum ( CL ) of different ages and to determine the expression of cytochrome-P450-1A1 ( P04798 ) and catechol-O-methyl transferase ( P21964 ) in CL and the action of 2-ME on P , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) secretion , and luteal angiogenesis . DESIGN : Experimental study . SETTING : University division of reproductive endocrinology . PATIENT(S) : Twenty-four women of reproductive age . INTERVENTION(S) : CL was collected from 15 women during the minilaparotomy for tubal sterilization . Granulosa lutein cells were harvested 36 hours after hCG administration in patients undergoing IVF . MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S) : Levels of 2-ME were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in CL . P04798 and P21964 were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot . P and P15692 were measured by radioimmunoassay and ELISA . The angiogenic potential was analyzed using EA.hy926 cells . RESULT(S) : Plasma levels of Eâ‚‚ decreased in the late luteal phase in association with an increase in luteal tissue of 2-ME concentrations . Concomitantly , there was a significant reduction of angiogenic activity in late CL . There was no significant variation in P04798 and P21964 expression in all CL . In physiological doses , 2-ME inhibited basal P15692 by granulosa lutein cells and diminished the angiogenic activity in conditioned media but did not prevent P and P15692 production stimulated by hCG . CONCLUSION(S) : These data suggest the participation of 2-ME in physiological luteolysis by reducing angiogenesis . However , 2-ME did not prevent in vitro hCG stimulation of P biosynthesis , providing a mechanism for CL rescue in the cycle of conception .
