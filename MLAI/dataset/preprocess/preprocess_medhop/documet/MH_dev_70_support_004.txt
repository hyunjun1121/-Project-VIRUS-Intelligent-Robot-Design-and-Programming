Biophysical and pharmacological characterization of hypotonically activated chloride currents in cortical astrocytes . Rat cortical astrocytes regulate their cell volume in response to hypotonic challenge . This regulation is believed to depend largely on the release of chloride or organic osmolytes through anion channels . Using whole-cell recordings , we identified weakly outwardly rectifying chloride currents that could be activated in response to hypotonic challenge . These currents exhibited the following permeability sequence upon replacement of chloride in the bathing solution with various anions : I- > NO3- > Cl- > Gluc- > or = MeS- > Ise- . Interestingly , extracellular I- , albeit showing the greatest permeability , blocked the currents with an IC50 of approximately 50 mM . Currents were almost completely inhibited by 123 microM P16860 and partially inhibited by 200 microM niflumic acid or 200 microM DIDS . Additionally , the total number of Cl- ions effluxed through the hypotonically activated channels was markedly similar to the total solute efflux during volume regulation . We therefore propose the hypotonically activated chloride channel as a major contributor to volume regulation of astrocytes . To examine potential candidate chloride channel genes expressed by astrocytes , we employed RT-PCR to demonstrate the presence of transcripts for P51788 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 7 , as well as for P21796 and P13569 in cultured astrocytes . Moreover , we performed immunostaining with antibodies against each of these channels and showed the strongest expression of P51788 and P51790 , strong expression of P51795 and P21796 , weak expression of P51798 and very weak expression of P51793 and P13569 . Intriguingly , although we found at least seven Cl- channel proteins from three different gene families in astrocytes , none appeared to be active in resting cells .
