DB00013 induces stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Both the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) play important roles with regard to hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) progression and metastasis . Notably , the stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) is an important chemokine involved in HCC pathology . However , the influence of uPA on P48061 expression in human HCC cells remains unknown . We investigated the mechanisms underlying the modulation of P48061 expression through uPA stimulation in human HCC SK-Hep-1 cells . SK-Hep-1 cells stimulation with uPA induced increases in the expression and secretion of P48061 . By using specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA , we have demonstrated that the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathways are critical for uPA-induced P48061 expression . Transcription factor ELISA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that uPA increase Sp1- and AP-1-DNA-binding activities in SK-Hep-1 cells . Inhibition of Sp1 and AP-1 activations by specific siRNAs blocked the uPA-induced P48061 promoter activity and expression . The effect of uPA on SK-Hep-1 signaling and P48061 expression is mediated by Q03405 . In summary , our findings serve to elucidate the uPA/ Q03405 downstream signaling , providing new insight into the function of uPA in HCC cells .
