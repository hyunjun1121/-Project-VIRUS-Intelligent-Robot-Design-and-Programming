[ DB00013 therapy of deep vein thrombosis ( author 's transl ) ] . 30 patients with deep vein thrombosis were treated with a combination of urokinase and heparin . Clinically relevant improvement was achieved in 2/3 of them with appr . 40,000 IU/h ( 1,000,000 IU/d ) urokinase administered over a period of several days . This indicates that urokinase at this dosage offers a valuable alternative or supplementation to fibrinolytic therapy with streptokinase . With the dosage employed , routine blood coagulation tests are only minimally affected , although a strong enhancement of fibrinolytic activity can be demonstrated by the euglobulin clot lysis time . P00747 depletion - as is usually observed with streptokinase therapy - does not occur . DB00013 is well tolerated and there is only a very moderate bleeding tendency . The cost per day of urokinase therapy at the dosage employed is approximately twice that of customary streptokinase therapy .
