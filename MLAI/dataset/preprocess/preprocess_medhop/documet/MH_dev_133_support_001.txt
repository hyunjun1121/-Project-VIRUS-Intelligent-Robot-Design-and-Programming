Pharmacogenetic tests in cancer chemotherapy : what physicians should know for clinical application . Significant efforts to develop pharmacogenomic predictors have been made to guide more effective and safer chemotherapy . Although a considerable amount of data has been generated from numerous experimental or clinical studies , there is a large gap between pharmacogenomic knowledge and clinical application . This review will focus on eight pharmacogenetic tests including P04818 , Q12882 , P22309 , P10635 , P00533 , P01116 , P08637 , and P38398 /2 to predict toxicity or response to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents . We will discuss the current level of evidence , if the current pharmacogenetic tests are appropriate for clinical application , and how to integrate the pharmacogenomic information into routine clinical practice .
