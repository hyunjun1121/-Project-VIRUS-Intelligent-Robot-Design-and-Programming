c-Fos protein as a target of anti-osteoclastogenic action of vitamin D , and synthesis of new analogs . Although active vitamin D drugs have been used for the treatment of osteoporosis , how the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) regulates bone cell function remains largely unknown . Using osteoprotegerin-deficient mice , which exhibit severe osteoporosis due to excessive receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 ) stimulation , we show herein that oral treatment of these mice with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] inhibited bone resorption and prevented bone loss , suggesting that P11473 counters O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 signaling . In P09603 -dependent osteoclast precursor cells isolated from mouse bone marrow , DB00136 potently and dose-dependently inhibited their differentiation into multinucleate osteoclasts induced by O14788 . Among signaling molecules downstream of Q9Y6Q6 , DB00136 inhibited the induction of c-Fos protein after O14788 stimulation , and retroviral expression of c-Fos protein abrogated the suppressive effect of DB00136 on osteoclast development . By screening vitamin D analogs based on their c-Fos-suppressing activity , we identified a new analog , named DD281 , that inhibited bone resorption and prevented bone loss in ovariectomized mice , more potently than DB00136 , with similar levels of calcium absorption . Thus , c-Fos protein is an important target of the skeletal action of P11473 -based drugs , and DD281 is a bone-selective analog that may be useful for the treatment of bone diseases with excessive osteoclastic activity .
