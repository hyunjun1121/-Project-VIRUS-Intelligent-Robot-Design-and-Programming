Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin 's disease with numerous lacunar cells were present in 3 cases , interfollicular Hodgkin 's disease in 4 cases and nodular paragranuloma in one case . Hodgkins ' and Reed Sternberg cells were positive for CD15 ( 4/7 ) , P28908 ( 5/7 ) , P15941 ( 3/6 ) and Q9NR12 -1 ( 4/5 ) . In situ hybridization on tissue sections demonstrate presence of EBV DNA in one case and EBER1-RNA in 2 of 4 cases . The difficulty in making the diagnosis of Hodgkin 's disease the relation between both diseases , and the role of P05231 are discussed .
