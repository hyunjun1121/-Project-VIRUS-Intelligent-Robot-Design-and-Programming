Stimulation of central β2-adrenoceptors suppresses NFκB activity in rat brain : a role for IκB . In this study we examined the impact of systemic treatment with the long-acting brain penetrant β2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol on NFκB activity and IκB expression in rat brain . DB01407 decreased NFκB activity ( p65 DNA binding ) in nuclear extracts prepared from rat cortex and hippocampus for up to 8h following a single treatment . This was accompanied by increased expression of IκBα mRNA and protein . The temporal increase in IκB protein expression paralleled the suppression of NFκB activity , suggesting that IκBα mediates the suppression NFκB activity observed . These actions of clenbuterol were prevented by pre-treatment with the non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol , the β2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118,551 , but not the β1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol , suggesting that the effects of clenbuterol on IκBα expression and NFκB activity are mediated specifically by the β2-adrenoceptor . In addition , the actions of clenbuterol were mimicked by systemic administration of another highly selective long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol . As neurodegenerative diseases are associated with inflammation we determined if clenbuterol could suppress NFκB activation that occurs in response to an inflammatory stimulus . In this regard we demonstrate that clenbuterol inhibited IκB phosphorylation and IκB degradation and inhibited NFκB activity in hippocampus and cortex of rats following a central injection of the inflammagen bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . In tandem , clenbuterol blocked expression of the NFκB-inducible genes P01375 -α and P05362 following LPS administration . Our finding that clenbuterol and formoterol inhibit NFκB activity in the CNS further supports the idea that β2-adrenoceptors may be an attractive target for treating neuroinflammation and combating inflammation-related neurodegeneration .
