Thyroid hormone status interferes with estrogen target gene expression in breast cancer samples in menopausal women . We investigated thyroid hormone levels in menopausal BrC patients and verified the action of triiodothyronine on genes regulated by estrogen and by triiodothyronine itself in BrC tissues . We selected 15 postmenopausal BrC patients and a control group of 18 postmenopausal women without BrC . We measured serum P07202 -AB , DB00024 , FT4 , and estradiol , before and after surgery , and used immunohistochemistry to examine estrogen and progesterone receptors . BrC primary tissue cultures received the following treatments : ethanol , triiodothyronine , triiodothyronine plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen , 4-hydroxytamoxifen , estrogen , or estrogen plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen . Genes regulated by estrogen ( P01135 , P01137 , and P06401 ) and by triiodothyronine ( Q07011 , P22004 , and P10827 ) in vitro were evaluated . DB00024 levels in BrC patients did not differ from those of the control group ( 1.34 ± 0.60 versus 2.41 ± 1.10 μ U/mL ) , but FT4 levels of BrC patients were statistically higher than controls ( 1.78 ± 0.20 versus 0.95 ± 0.16 ng/dL ) . P01135 was upregulated and downregulated after estrogen and triiodothyronine treatment , respectively . DB00279 increased P06401 expression ; however 4-hydroxytamoxifen did not block triiodothyronine action on P06401 expression . DB04468 , alone or associated with triiodothyronine , modulated gene expression of Q07011 , P22004 , and P10827 , similar to triiodothyronine treatment . Thus , our work highlights the importance of thyroid hormone status evaluation and its ability to interfere with estrogen target gene expression in BrC samples in menopausal women .
