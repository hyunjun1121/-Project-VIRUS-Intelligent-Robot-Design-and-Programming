Identification of the P07947 Kinase as a Therapeutic Target in Basal-Like Breast Cancers . Normal cellular behavior can be described as a complex , regulated network of interaction between genes and proteins . Targeted cancer therapies aim to neutralize specific proteins that are necessary for the cancer cell to remain viable in vivo . Ideally , the proteins targeted should be such that their downregulation has a major impact on the survival/fitness of the tumor cells and , at the same time , has a smaller effect on normal cells . It is difficult to use standard analysis methods on gene or protein expression levels to identify these targets because the level thresholds for tumorigenic behavior are different for different genes/proteins . We have developed a novel methodology to identify therapeutic targets by using a new paradigm called " gene centrality. " The main idea is that , in addition to being overexpressed , good therapeutic targets should have a high degree of connectivity in the tumor network because one expects that suppression of its expression would affect many other genes . We propose a mathematical quantity called " centrality , " which measures the degree of connectivity of genes in a network in which each edge is weighted by the expression level of the target gene . Using our method , we found that several P12931 proto-oncogenes P07948 , P07947 , P08631 , P06241 , and P06239 have high centrality in identifiable subsets of basal-like and P04626 + breast cancers . To experimentally validate the clinical value of this finding , we evaluated the effect of P07947 knockdown in basal-like breast cancer cell lines that overexpress this gene . We found that P07947 downregulation has a significant effect on the survival of these cell lines . Our results identify P07947 as a target for therapeutics in a subset of basal-like breast cancers .
