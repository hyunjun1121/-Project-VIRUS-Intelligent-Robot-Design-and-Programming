Activating mutations of GNAS in canine cortisol-secreting adrenocortical tumors . BACKGROUND : Cushing 's syndrome or hypercortisolism is a common endocrinopathy in dogs . In approximately 15 % of cases , the disorder is caused by adrenocorticotropin ( DB01285 ) -independent hypersecretion of cortisol by an adrenocortical tumor ( AT ) . Without other explanation , the cortisol hypersecretion has been referred to as autonomous . OBJECTIVES : To investigate whether DB01285 -independent hypersecretion of cortisol may be associated with aberrant activation of the melanocortin 2 receptor ( Q01718 ) -cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) -protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway . ANIMALS : All analyses were performed on 44 cortisol-secreting ATs ( 14 adenomas and 30 carcinomas ) derived from dogs diagnosed with DB01285 -independent hypercortisolism . METHODS : Mutation analysis was performed of genes encoding the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit ( GNAS ) , Q01718 , and PKA regulatory subunit 1A ( P10644 ) in all ATs . RESULTS : Approximately one-third of all ATs harbored an activating mutation of GNAS . Missense mutations , known to result in constitutive activation , were present in codon 201 in 11 ATs , in codon 203 ( 1 AT ) , and in codon 227 ( 3 ATs ) . No functional mutations were found in Q01718 and P10644 . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE : Activation of DB02527 signaling is a frequent event in canine cortisol-secreting ATs and may play a crucial role in both DB01285 -independent cortisol production and tumor formation . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of potentially causative mutations in canine cortisol-secreting ATs .
