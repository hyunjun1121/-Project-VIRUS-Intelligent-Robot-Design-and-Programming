Extracellular P10415 proteins are danger-associated molecular patterns that reduce tissue damage in murine models of ischemia-reperfusion injury . BACKGROUND : Ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury contributes to organ dysfunction in a variety of clinical disorders , including myocardial infarction , stroke , organ transplantation , and hemorrhagic shock . Recent investigations have demonstrated that apoptosis as an important mechanism of cell death leading to organ dysfunction following I/R . Intracellular danger-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) released during cell death can activate cytoprotective responses by engaging receptors of the innate immune system . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Ischemia was induced in the mouse hind limb by tourniquet or in the heart by coronary artery ligation . Reperfusion injury of skeletal or cardiac muscle was markedly reduced by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of recombinant human (rh) P10415 protein or rhBCL2-related protein A1 ( Q16548 ) ( 50 ng/g ) given prior to ischemia or at the time of reperfusion . The cytoprotective activity of extracellular rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 protein was mapped to the BH4 domain , as treatment with a mutant P10415 protein lacking the BH4 domain was not protective , whereas peptides derived from the BH4 domain of P10415 or the BH4-like domain of Q16548 were . Protection by extracellular rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 was associated with a reduction in apoptosis in skeletal and cardiac muscle following I/R , concomitant with increased expression of endogenous mouse P10415 ( mBCL2 ) protein . Notably , treatment with rhBCL2A1 protein did not protect mice deficient in toll-like receptor-2 ( O60603 ) or the adaptor protein , myeloid differentiation factor-88 ( MyD88 ) . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Treatment with cytokine-like doses of rhBCL2 or rhBCL2A1 protein or BH4-domain peptides reduces apoptosis and tissue injury following I/R by a O60603 -MyD88-dependent mechanism . These findings establish a novel extracellular cytoprotective activity of P10415 BH4-domain proteins as potent cytoprotective DAMPs .
