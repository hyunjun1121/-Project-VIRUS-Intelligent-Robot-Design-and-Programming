A Nile blue based infrared fluorescent probe : imaging tumors that over-express cyclooxygenase-2 . The first Golgi-localized cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) -specific near-infrared ( Q9Y3T9 ) fluorescent probe , Niblue- P13671 -IMC , able to detect cancer cells , was designed . Importantly , Niblue- P13671 -IMC preferentially labeled the tumors in a mouse tumor model with deep tissue penetration capacity . It may be a promising molecular tool for guiding tumor resection during surgery .
