Discovery of a calcimimetic with differential effects on parathyroid hormone and calcitonin secretion . Calcimimetics are positive allosteric modulators to the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) . Activation of the P41180 inhibits the secretion of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , stimulates the secretion of calcitonin , and decreases serum calcium ( Ca(2+) ) . DB01012 , a second-generation calcimimetic , is used therapeutically to control PTH in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism . A calcimimetic that displays increased separation of PTH versus Ca(2+) lowering in patients would potentially allow the use of calcimimetics to treat patients in earlier stages of renal disease because hypocalcemia can develop in this population . Toward this end , we developed a third-generation calcimimetic , determined the molecular pharmacological properties of it using an operation model of allosteric modulation/agonism , and measured the compound effects on PTH , serum ionized Ca(2+) , and calcitonin levels in 5/6 nephrectomized rats . We found the new molecule effectively reduced PTH levels without promoting calcitonin secretion or hypocalcemia . Furthermore , our third-generation molecule was less efficacious at promoting calcitonin secretion from human thyroid carcinoma cells compared with 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-N- ( ( 1R ) -1-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl ) -1-propanamine ( R-568 ) , a first-generation calcimimetic . These data provide evidence that calcimimetics with increased potency can be used to lower PTH without production of significant hypocalcemia because the threshold for inhibition of PTH secretion is much lower than the threshold for calcitonin secretion .
