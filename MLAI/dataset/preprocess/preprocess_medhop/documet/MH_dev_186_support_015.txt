Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide reduces anxiety-like responses to pair housing . Many psychological disorders are characterized by anxiety and alterations in social interactions . Recent studies demonstrate that the chemical messenger nitric oxide ( NO ) can regulate both anxiety and social behaviours . We tested whether an enzyme that produces NO in the brain , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( P29475 ) , serves as an interface between social interactions and anxiety-like behaviour . Several investigators have observed that mice increase anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus-maze after pair housing . P29475 gene deletion and DB01997 were used to inhibit the production of neuronal NO . Similar to previous studies , pair housing reduced open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze . Pair housing also increased corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) of the hypothalamus . Inhibition of NO production increased open arm exploration in pair-housed mice but decreased open arm exploration in individually housed mice . These results suggest that the effect of P29475 inhibition on anxiety-like responses is context dependent and that behavioural responses to social housing are altered after P29475 inhibition . This research suggests that NO may play an important role in mediating the effect social interactions have on anxiety .
