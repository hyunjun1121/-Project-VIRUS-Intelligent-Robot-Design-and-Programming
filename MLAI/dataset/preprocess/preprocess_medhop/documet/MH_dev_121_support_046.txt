Detection of thymidylate synthase modulators by a novel screening assay . P04818 ( TS ) , a key cancer chemotherapeutic target , catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate . TS can serve as a repressor of its own synthesis by binding to its own mRNA through TS-specific binding elements ( TBEs ) . In this report , we describe the use of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two TBEs that can be used as a tool for the identification and initial profiling of compounds that modulate TS activity , levels , or ability to bind mRNA . To validate this model , we evaluated several groups of drugs . Thus , cells were exposed to the pyrimidine analogs 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) , 5-fluorouridine ( DB01629 ) , 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine ( FUdR ) , trifluorothymidine ( DB00432 ) ; to the nonpyrimidine TS-inhibitors AG-331 , nolatrexed ( AG337 ) , and raltitrexed ( DB00293 ) ; or to drugs with other primary sites of action ( methotrexate , actinomycin D , 5-azacytidine , 8-thioguanosine ) . Except for 5-azacytidine and 8-thioguanosine , all compounds examined induced luciferase activity compared with untreated cells . Effects of luciferase activity inducing drugs through TS-affected translation were confirmed by examinations of TS protein and mRNA levels . Treatment of H630- P13671 cells with DB00544 , DB01629 , FUdR , DB00432 , AG331 , AG337 , DB00293 , and methotrexate up-regulated TS levels as determined by Western blot analysis , although TS mRNA levels remained unchanged as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . Our studies demonstrate a novel application of a TBE-dependent reporter plasmid that could be used for the high-throughput identification of potential chemotherapeutic agents that modulate TS RNA-binding activity , either directly or indirectly .
