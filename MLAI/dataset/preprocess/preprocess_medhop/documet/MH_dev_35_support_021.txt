5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -antagonist properties of cyamemazine : significance for its clinical anxiolytic activity . RATIONALE : DB09000 is a neuroleptic compound which possesses anxiolytic properties in humans . On the other hand , 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -receptors have been implicated in anxiety disorders and a previous binding study has shown that cyamemazine possesses high affinity for both serotonin receptor types . OBJECTIVE : The present study was undertaken to establish whether cyamemazine antagonizes 5- Q9H205 - and/or P28335 -mediated responses , and whether it compares with reference compounds . METHODS : DB09000 was tested for its ability to antagonize : ( i ) 5- Q9H205 -dependent contraction of the isolated guinea-pig ileum and bradycardic responses in the rat and ( ii ) P28335 -dependent phospholipase C ( P98160 ) stimulation in rat brain membranes . RESULTS : In isolated guinea-pig ileum , cyamemazine potently and competitively antagonized 5-HT-dependent contractions ( pA2 = 7.52 +/- 0.08 ; n = 5 ) . In this test , cyamemazine was 5-7 times more potent ( pIC50 = 6.75 +/- 0.13 ) than tropisetron ( pIC50 = 6.02 +/- 0.04 ) . In rats , cyamemazine i.v. antagonized 5-HT-dependent bradycardic responses with ID50 % = 3.2 +/- 1.5 mg/kg ( n = 4 ) . Finally , in rat brain membranes cyamemazine antagonized P28335 -dependent P98160 stimulation with Ki = 424 nM ( mianserin exhibits a Ki = 113 nM ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB09000 behaves as an antagonist at both 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -receptors , which compares well with reference compounds . These 5- Q9H205 - and P28335 -antagonistic actions of cyamemazine can be involved , at least in part , in its beneficial therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders .
