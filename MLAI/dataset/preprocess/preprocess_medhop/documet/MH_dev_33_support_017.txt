P06748 -RAR , not the RAR- P06748 reciprocal t(5;17)(q35;q21) acute promyelocytic leukemia fusion protein , inhibits myeloid differentiation . The t(5;17) variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) fuses the nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) gene at 5q35 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( P10276 ) at 17q12-22 . We have previously shown that leukemic cells express both P06748 -RAR and RAR- P06748 reciprocal translocation products . In this study we investigated the potential role of both proteins in modulating myeloid differentiation . Expression of P06748 -RAR inhibited vitamin D3/transforming growth factor β ( TGFβ ) -mediated differentiation of U937 cells by more than 50 % . In contrast , RAR- P06748 expression did not alter vitamin D3/TGFβ-induced differentiation of U937 clones . These results indicate that P06748 -RAR , not RAR- P06748 , is the prime mediator of myeloid differentiation arrest in t(5;17) APL .
