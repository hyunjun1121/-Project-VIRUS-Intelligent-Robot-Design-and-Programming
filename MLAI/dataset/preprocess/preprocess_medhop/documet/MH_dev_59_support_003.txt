DB09222 binding to P05362 promotes P00533 -dependent mucin production in human airway epithelial cells . Mucous hypersecretion is a serious feature of chronic airway diseases such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , and cystic fibrosis . Although mucins are produced via activation of an P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) signaling cascade , the mechanisms leading to exaggerated mucin production in mucous hypersecretory diseases are unknown . Because expression of P05362 and of the P05362 ligand fibrinogen is increased in the airways of subjects with mucous hypersecretory diseases , we hypothesized that fibrinogen binding to P05362 could increase P00533 -dependent mucin production in human airway ( NCI-H292 ) epithelial cells . Consistent with this hypothesis , we found that an P05362 neutralizing antibody and an P05362 (8-22) peptide that binds fibrinogen decreased mucin production induced by the P00533 ligand transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha dose-dependently . Exogenous fibrinogen and a fibrinogen(117-133) peptide that binds P05362 rescued mucin production in cells treated with the P05362 (8-22) peptide . Surprisingly , the P05362 (8-22) peptide increased P00533 phosphotyrosine and phospho- P27361 /2 in cells treated with TGF-alpha . The P05362 (8-22) peptide-induced increases in P00533 phosphotyrosine and phospho- P27361 /2 were prevented by exogenous fibrinogen , by the fibrinogen(117-133) peptide , and by selective inhibitors of phospholipase C ( P98160 ) , protein kinase C ( PKC ) -alpha/beta , and metalloproteases . These results suggest that fibrinogen binding to P05362 promotes mucin production by decreasing TGF-alpha-induced P00533 and P27361 /2 activation and that the fibrinogen- P05362 -dependent decrease in P00533 and P27361 /2 activation occurs via inhibition of an early positive feedback pathway involving P98160 - and P17252 /beta-dependent metalloprotease activation and subsequent metalloprotease-dependent P00533 reactivation .
