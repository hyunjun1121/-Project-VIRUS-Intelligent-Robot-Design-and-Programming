DB05812 acetate : a promising drug for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer . DB05812 acetate ( CB7630 ) , a pregnenolone analog , is an orally administered small molecule that irreversibly inhibits a rate-limiting enzyme in androgen biosynthesis , P05093 , and blocks the synthesis of androgens in the testes , adrenal glands and prostate without causing adrenal insufficiency . In clinical studies , abiraterone acetate is well tolerated and shows promising clinical activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer . The recommended Phase II dose of abiraterone acetate is 1000 mg orally daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily . Side effects are minimal and mostly associated with secondary mineralocorticoid excess , owing to a compensatory increase in upstream steroids , such as deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone . These include hypertension , hypokalemia and edema and are easily manageable with a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist , such as eplerenone , or low-dose corticosteroids . Currently , abiraterone acetate is being tested in a Phase III trial for men with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer who are chemotherapy naive . A Phase III trial for patients following prior chemotherapy has been completed and is awaiting analysis .
