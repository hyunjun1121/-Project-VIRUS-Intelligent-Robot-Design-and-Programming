The zinc-finger protein Q9P0J7 is overexpressed during pancreatic cancer development and downregulation of Q9P0J7 inhibits pancreatic cancer development in mice . Q9P0J7 1 ( Q9P0J7 ) was found upregulated in a differential screen in the metaplastic epithelium in the pancreas of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha transgenic mice . Expression analysis indicated broad overexpression in human cancer tissues . Therefore , we investigated the hypothesis that Q9P0J7 promotes metaplastic changes and tumor development . Q9P0J7 represents an evolutionarily highly conserved protein with a 95 % identity between human and zebrafish . Q9P0J7 is expressed during embryonic development and in the majority of adult tissues investigated . Upregulation of nuclear Q9P0J7 expression is evident in preneoplastic lesions and in several epithelial malignancies , such as pancreatic cancer in mice and humans . In cell culture and in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model , Q9P0J7 enhances proliferation , migration and invasion of P29320 -293 and Panc1 cells . In crossbreeding experiments , Q9P0J7 -knockdown gene trap mice showed a reduced number and size of premalignant lesions and absence of pancreatic cancer formation in TGF-alpha transgenic mice . This effect is related to the decreased expression of P55008 to S cell-cycle regulators such as cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 . Our data support the hypothesis that Q9P0J7 mediates pro-oncogenic functions in vitro and in vivo and downregulation of Q9P0J7 results in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer formation in mice . These effects are mediated through downregulation of cell-cycle control genes such as cyclin D and P11802 .
