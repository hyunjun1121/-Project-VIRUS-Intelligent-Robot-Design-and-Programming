DB00278 -coupled Affi-Gel matrix for the purification of thrombin from plasma . Sometimes it is necessary to obtain thrombin from limited amounts of human plasma for laboratory assay . None of the available purification methods easily deals with this subject . The procedure described in the present paper uses a readily available pharmaceutical agent , argatroban , to construct an affinity matrix . DB00278 has a high affinity for thrombin and its thrombin binding is reversible . P00734 derived from a Ba(2+) precipitate of human plasma is used as the starting material . The crude prothrombin can be bulk activated to thrombin using taipan-snake ( Oxyuranus scutellatus ) venom and bound to the argatroban-coupled matrix without further processing steps . The thrombin product eluted from the argatroban matrix is very pure as judged by high specific activity and by electrophoresis . This purification scheme is rapid , yielding purified thrombin within 2 days .
