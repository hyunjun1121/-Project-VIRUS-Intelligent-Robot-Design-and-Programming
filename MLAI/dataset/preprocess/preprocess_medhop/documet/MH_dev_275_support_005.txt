APELIN promotes hematopoiesis from human embryonic stem cells . Transcriptional profiling of differentiating human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) revealed that Q9H2W2 -positive mesodermal precursors were enriched for transcripts encoding the G-protein-coupled APELIN receptor ( P35414 ) . P35414 -positive cells , identified by binding of the fluoresceinated peptide ligand , APELIN ( Q9ULZ1 ) , or an anti- P35414 mAb , were found in both posterior mesoderm and anterior mesendoderm populations and were enriched in hemangioblast colony-forming cells ( Bl- Q15814 ) . The addition of Q9ULZ1 peptide to the media enhanced the growth of embryoid bodies ( EBs ) , increased the expression of hematoendothelial genes in differentiating hESCs , and increased the frequency of Bl-CFCs by up to 10-fold . Furthermore , Q9ULZ1 peptide also synergized with P15692 to promote the growth of hESC-derived endothelial cells . These studies identified Q9ULZ1 as a novel growth factor for hESC-derived hematopoietic and endothelial cells .
