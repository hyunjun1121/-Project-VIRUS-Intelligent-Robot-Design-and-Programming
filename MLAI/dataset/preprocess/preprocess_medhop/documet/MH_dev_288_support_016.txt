Stimulated secretion of endothelial P04275 is accompanied by rapid redistribution to the cell surface of the intracellular granule membrane protein P16109 . We have examined the cell activation-dependent redistribution of the intracellular granule membrane protein P16109 of human endothelial cells . By dual-label immunofluorescence , the distribution of P16109 within cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells was found to coincide with the distribution of P04275 ( P04275 ) , suggesting that P16109 is located in the membranes of P04275 -containing storage granules . Stimulation of P04275 secretion resulted in an increase in P16109 on the cell surface , as detected by increased binding of the monoclonal antibody P28222 which recognizes the extracytoplasmic domain of P16109 . For each agonist tested ( histamine , thrombin , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , and the calcium ionophore A23187 ) a dose-dependent redistribution of P16109 to the endothelial surface was observed which closely paralleled the dose-dependent secretion of P04275 into the cell supernatant . When cells were maximally stimulated by histamine in the presence of antibody P28222 , a 4-fold increase in P28222 uptake by the cells was observed . This increase occurred rapidly and reached a plateau by 10 min . In contrast , when histamine-stimulated cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde or chilled to 4 degrees C before addition of antibody P28222 , only a transient increase in cell surface P16109 was detected . Under these conditions of arrested membrane turnover during antibody binding , cell surface P16109 was maximal 3 min after histamine stimulation and then declined to control levels by 20 min . These data suggest that stimulated secretion of P04275 from endothelial cells entails fusion of P04275 -containing storage granules with the plasma membrane . Once inserted into the plasma membrane , P16109 is subsequently removed from the endothelial surface , most likely by an endocytic mechanism .
