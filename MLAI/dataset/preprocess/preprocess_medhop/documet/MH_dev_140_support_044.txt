DB00338 , a gastric proton pump inhibitor , inhibits melanogenesis by blocking Q04656 trafficking . DB00338 is a proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastrosophageal reflux disease and acts by irreversibly blocking P20648 , a P-type H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells . We found that omeprazole and its closely related congeners inhibited melanogenesis at micromolar concentrations in B16 mouse melanoma cells , normal human epidermal melanocytes , and in a reconstructed human skin model . DB00338 topically applied to the skin of UV-irradiated human subjects significantly reduced pigment levels after 3 weeks compared with untreated controls . DB00338 had no significant inhibitory effect on the activities of purified human tyrosinase or on the mRNA levels of tyrosinase , dopachrome tautomerase , Pmel17 , or O75030 mRNA levels . Although melanocytes do not express P20648 , they do express Q04656 , a copper transporting P-type ATPase in the trans-Golgi network that is required for copper acquisition by tyrosinase . Q04656 relocalization from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane in response to elevated copper concentrations in melanocytes was inhibited by omeprazole . DB00338 treatment increased the proportion of EndoH sensitive tyrosinase , indicating that tyrosinase maturation was impaired . In addition , omeprazole reduced tyrosinase protein abundance in the presence of cycloheximide , suggestive of increased degradation . Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that omeprazole reduces melanogenesis by inhibiting Q04656 and by enhancing degradation of tyrosinase .
