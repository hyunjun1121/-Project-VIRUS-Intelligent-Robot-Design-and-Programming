New strategies to overcome limitations of reversible P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in non-small cell lung cancer . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , a member of the HER family of receptors , has become a well-established target for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Several P00533 -targeted agents produce objective responses in a minority of unselected patients , but a majority of those with P00533 -activating mutations ; however , all responders eventually develop resistance . The modest activity of agents that target only P00533 may be due , in part , to the complexity and interdependency of HER family signaling . The interdependent signaling that occurs between P00533 and P04626 provides a rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of these receptors with reversible and irreversible inhibitors . Several agents with activity against both P00533 and P04626 are currently under development . Irreversible P00533 / P04626 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) ( e.g. , DB08916 , HKI-272 ) and pan-HER TKIs ( e.g. , PF00299804 ) comprise a novel class of agents in clinical development that may prevent and overcome inherent and acquired resistance to first-generation reversible P00533 TKIs . Other agents in development include the monoclonal antibody pertuzumab , and XL-647 , which inhibits P00533 and P04626 , as well as multiple vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family members . Here we briefly review the currently available P00533 -targeted agents , discuss the rationale for extending inhibition to other HER family members , weigh the merits of irreversible HER family inhibition , and summarize preclinical and clinical data with P00533 / P04626 and pan-HER inhibitors under clinical development .
