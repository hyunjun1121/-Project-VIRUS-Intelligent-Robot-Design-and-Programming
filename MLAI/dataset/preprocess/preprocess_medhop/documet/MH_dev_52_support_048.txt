Inhibitory effects of a phosphate diester of DB00163 and ascorbic acid ( EPC- P04264 ) on myocardial infarction in rats . The inhibitory effect of a phosphate diester of DB00163 and ascorbic acid ( EPC- P04264 ) was examined in myocardial infarction induced in rats , in comparison with a selective P09917 inhibitor , AA-861 . EPC- P04264 significantly reduced the infarct size at 24 and 48 h after ligation , whereas AA-861 reduced it only at 48 h after ligation . In in-vitro experiments , EPC- P04264 inhibited not only superoxide anion generation ( IC50 = 4.2 x 10(-5) M ) , but also acid phosphatase activity ( IC50 = 2.4 x 10(-5) M ) in rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes in a concentration-dependent manner , while AA-861 showed marginal effects on both actions . These results indicated that EPC- P04264 induced cardioprotective effects by affecting neutrophil functions by inhibition of generation of superoxide-anion generation and acid-phosphatase activity . The mechanism of the reduction of the infarct size by EPC- P04264 differed from that of AA-861 , which latter inhibited P09917 and the formation of leukotriene B4 .
