Protease inhibitors prevent plasminogen-mediated , but not pemphigus vulgaris-induced , acantholysis in human epidermis . Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes . It is caused by autoantibodies directed against desmosomes , which are the principal adhesion structures between epidermal keratinocytes . Binding of autoantibodies leads to the destruction of desmosomes resulting in the loss of cell-cell adhesion ( acantholysis ) and epidermal blisters . The plasminogen activator system has been implicated as a proteolytic effector in pemphigus . We have tested inhibitors of the plasminogen activator system with regard to their potential to prevent pemphigus-induced cutaneous pathology . In a human split skin culture system , IgG preparations of sera from pemphigus vulgaris patients caused histopathologic changes ( acantholysis ) similar to those observed in the original pemphigus disease . All inhibitors that were tested ( active site inhibitors directed against uPA , tPA , and/or plasmin ; antibodies neutralizing the enzymatic activity of uPA or tPA ; substances interfering with the binding of uPA to its specific cell surface receptor Q03405 ) failed to prevent pemphigus vulgaris IgG-mediated acantholysis . P00747 -mediated acantholysis , however , was effectively antagonized by the synthetic active site serine protease inhibitor DB05476 or by p-aminomethylbenzoic acid . Our data argue against applying anti-plasminogen activator/anti-plasmin strategies in the management of pemphigus .
