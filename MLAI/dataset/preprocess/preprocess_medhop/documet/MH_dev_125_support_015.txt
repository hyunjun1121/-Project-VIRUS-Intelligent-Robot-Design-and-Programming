Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 , but not P08253 , is involved in the development and progression of C protein-induced myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy . Repeated or continuous inflammation of the heart is one of the initiation factors for dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) . In previous studies , we established a DCM animal model by immunizing rats with cardiac C protein . In the present study , we analyze the role of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) in experimental autoimmune carditis ( EAC ) and subsequent DCM to elucidate the pathomechanisms of this disease . In this model , inflammation begins approximately 9 days after immunization . At that time , MMP activities were detected by in situ zymography . Real-time PCR analysis revealed continuous up-regulation of P08253 mRNA from 2 wk and thereafter . P14780 mRNA , however , had only a transient increase at 2 wk . Double staining with in situ zymography and cell markers demonstrated that gelatinase ( P08253 and P14780 ) -expressing cells are infiltrating macrophages during the early stage and cardiomyocytes at later stages . DB01017 , which inhibits P14780 activities more strongly than P08253 , significantly suppressed EAC , but an P08253 -specific inhibitor , TISAM , did not affect the course of the disease . Furthermore , immunohistochemical examination revealed that minocycline treatment suppressed T cell and macrophage infiltration strongly , whereas TISAM did not . These findings indicate that P14780 , but not P08253 , is involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of EAC , and further suggest that P14780 inhibitors , minocycline and its derivatives , may be useful therapies for EAC and DCM .
