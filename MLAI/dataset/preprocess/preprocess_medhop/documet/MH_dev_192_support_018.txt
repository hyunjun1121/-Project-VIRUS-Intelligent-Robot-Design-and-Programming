Synthesis and biological evaluation of a library of resveratrol analogues as inhibitors of P23219 , P35354 and NF-kappaB . DB02709 ( 4,3',5'-trihydroxystilbene ) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB . A 78-membered library of resveratrol analogues in which the substituents on the two aryl rings and alkene were varied was synthesized using a solid-phase Wittig olefination reaction . The library contains inhibitors against all three proteins that were more potent than resveratrol itself . Preliminary structure-activity relationships were also obtained from these data that permitted the derivation of pharmacophore models for each of the three targets .
