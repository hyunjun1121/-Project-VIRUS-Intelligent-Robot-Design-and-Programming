DB01296 sulfate suppresses the expressions of urokinase plasminogen activator and inhibitor and gelatinases during the early stage of osteoarthritis . BACKGROUND : DB01296 sulfate may have an ex vivo inhibitory effect on the plasminogen activator ( PA ) /plasmin system and gelatinases expression during the early development of osteoarthritis ( OA ) . METHODS : We compared the levels of urokinase-type PA ( u-PA ) , PA inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) and gelatinases ( matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 [ P08253 and -9 ] ) in a series of chondral , meniscal , and synovial cultures of early OA after treatment with or without glucosamine sulfate . RESULTS : Gelatin zymography revealed that glucosamine sulfate could suppress P08253 secretion in chondral , meniscal and synovial cultures and also decrease P14780 production in synovial and meniscal cultures . ELISA data also showed the suppressive effects of glucosamine sulfate on u-PA and P05121 production in synovial cultures at 48 h . CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that one of the therapeutic effects of glucosamine sulfate is to down-regulate the expressions of u-PA , P05121 , P08253 and P14780 that underlie the destruction of articular cartilage in the early stage of OA , and therefore to delay the joint failure .
