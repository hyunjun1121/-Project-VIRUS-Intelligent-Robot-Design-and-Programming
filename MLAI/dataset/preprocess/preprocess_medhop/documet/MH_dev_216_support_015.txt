Synergism of Q9HC29 and Q96P20 activators promotes a unique transcriptional profile in murine dendritic cells . NLRs are cytoplasmic proteins that sense cellular stress and intracellular damage resulting from pathogen uptake . To date , the role of NLRs has been studied using combinations of NLR and TLR agonists , but the interplay between two different NLRs remains uncharacterized . In this study , we employed microarrays to investigate in DCs the regulation of gene transcription mediated by activation of Q9HC29 and Q96P20 pathways using P16444 and MSU . P16444 and MSU co-stimulation of murine BMDCs up-regulated the expression of genes encoding molecules for antigen presentation and co-stimulation ( MHC class II , P33681 , P42081 ) , integrins ( P05106 , P06756 ) , cytokines ( IL-1α , IL-1β , P05231 , P60568 , Q9NPF7 , IL-12p40 ) , and chemokines ( P09341 , P19875 ) . Transcription of the cytokine genes induced by P16444 and MSU partially depended on Q9HC29 but was independent of Q96P20 . Finally , we showed that P27361 and c- P05412 activation increased upon P16444 and MSU co-stimulation . As a whole , the results indicate that two different NLR activators synergize at the transcriptional level , leading to unique differential expression of genes involved in the innate immune response .
