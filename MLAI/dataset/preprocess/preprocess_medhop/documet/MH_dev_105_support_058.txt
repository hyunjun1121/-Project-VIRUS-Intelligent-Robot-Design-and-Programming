Potential of afatinib in the treatment of patients with P04626 -positive breast cancer . In the absence of treatment , overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) predicts a poor prognosis in breast cancer . In the last decade , monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have significantly improved the outcome of P04626 -positive breast cancer patients . However , tumor resistance and toxicities often limit the use of these therapies . For this reason , there is a compelling need for further investigation of new targeted therapies , such as afatinib , an oral irreversible pan inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) family . This compound covalently interacts with tyrosine kinase domains , which are deeply involved in signal transduction leading to cell proliferation and protection from apoptosis . DB08916 has been studied in several Phase I clinical trials in advanced solid tumors . These trials have shown encouraging clinical activity and manageable side effects when afatinib is used either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy , with cutaneous adverse events and diarrhea being the most frequently observed toxicities . This review will focus on afatinib 's clinical activity and will discuss ongoing clinical studies in P04626 -positive breast cancer patients . In the scenario of the different P04626 -targeted therapies , it will be important to define the best specific clinical and " molecular " setting for afatinib use , trying to identify predictors of resistance and response . Moreover , afatinib , which has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier , could play a role in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer .
