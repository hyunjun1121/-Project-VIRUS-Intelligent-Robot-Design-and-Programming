Protein assay for heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) induced by chemicals in HepG2 cells . Levels of heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) , a stress response protein , were measured to examine oxidative stress induced by several chemicals in HepG2 cells with and without S9mix using an ELISA . CdCl(2) , heme , and diclofenac sodium salt ( diclofenac ) were used as inducers of P09601 . Acetaminophen ( P08697 ) and cyclophosphamide ( CP ) were used as oxidative stress inducers . Stannic mesoporphyrin ( DB04912 ) was used as an inhibitor of HO activity . Cytotoxicity was determined , and P09601 levels were measured in HepG2 cells exposed to chemicals other than CP with non-metabolic activation without S9mix , and to diclofenac , P08697 and CP with metabolic activation with S9mix . P09601 levels were increased by CdCl(2) ( 7.5 microM ) , heme ( 10 , 100 microM ) , and stannic mesoporphyrin ( DB04912 ) ( 10 microM ) , but were not changed by P08697 , and were decreased by diclofenac . P09601 levels were increased by diclofenac ( 300 microM ) , and CP ( 36 microM ) , but were unaffected by P08697 because of low sensitivity in HepG2 cells . The induction of P09601 expression was first observed in cultured HepG2 cells treated with CP under conditions involving metabolic activation . These results showed the measurement of P09601 protein levels in this system is useful when assessing oxidative stress as a tool for detecting drug toxicity .
