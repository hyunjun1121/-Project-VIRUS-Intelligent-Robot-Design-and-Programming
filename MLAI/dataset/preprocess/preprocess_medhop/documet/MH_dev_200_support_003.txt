Andrographis paniculata extract ( DB05767 ) for active ulcerative colitis . OBJECTIVES : Andrographis paniculata has in vitro inhibitory activity against P01375 -α , IL-1β and NF-κB . A pilot study of A. paniculata extract ( DB05767 ) suggested similar efficacy to mesalamine for ulcerative colitis . METHODS : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of A. paniculata extract ( DB05767 ) in 224 adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis . Patients were randomized to A. paniculata extract ( DB05767 ) 1,200 mg or 1,800 mg daily or placebo for 8 weeks . RESULTS : In total , 45 and 60 % of patients receiving A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily , respectively , were in clinical response at week 8 , compared with 40 % of those who received placebo ( P=0.5924 for 1,200 mg vs. placebo and P=0.0183 for 1,800 mg vs. placebo ) . In all , 34 and 38 % of patients receiving A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily , respectively , were in clinical remission at week 8 , compared with 25 % of those who received placebo ( P=0.2582 for 1,200 mg vs. placebo and P=0.1011 for 1,800 mg vs. placebo ) . Adverse events developed in 60 and 53 % of patients in the A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily groups , respectively , and 60 % in the placebo group . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis treated with A. paniculata extract ( DB05767 ) at a dose of 1,800 mg daily were more likely to achieve clinical response than those receiving placebo .
