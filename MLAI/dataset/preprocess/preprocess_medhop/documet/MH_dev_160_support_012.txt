Strategies targeting tumor necrosis factor in Crohn 's disease . P01375 plays an important role in mediating the inflammation of Crohn 's disease . Strategies aimed at reducing tumor necrosis factor in patients with Crohn 's disease include the mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab , the humanized monoclonal antibody CDP571 , the human recombinant tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein etanercept , and the small molecule thalidomide . DB00065 is effective for treating active Crohn 's disease , maintaining remission , and closing fistulas . Side effects occurring in patients treated with infliximab include human anti-chimeric antibodies , infusion reactions , formation of autoantibodies , and rarely drug induced lupus . CDP571 is effective for treating active Crohn 's disease , steroid sparing , and possibly for closing fistulas and maintaining remission . Side effects occurring in patients treated with CDP571 include anti-idiotype antibodies , infusion reactions , and formation of autoantibodies . Pilot studies have suggested that etanercept and thalidomide may also be beneficial . Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies are effective for the treatment for Crohn 's disease .
