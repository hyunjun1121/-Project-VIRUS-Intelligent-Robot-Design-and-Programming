Effect of licofelone -- a dual P36551 /5- P28300 inhibitor in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin-induced behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in rats . The present study was designed to investigate the effect of licofelone-a dual cyclooxygenase/ P09917 ( P36551 /5- P28300 ) inhibitor in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin ( ICV- Q11206 ) -induced cognitive deficit and biochemical abnormalities in rats . ICV- Q11206 is a widely used model of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease . In this study , Q11206 was administered intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)-bilaterally 3 mg/kg in rats . The Q11206 -injected rats were treated with different doses of licofelone ( 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mg/kg , p.o. ) for 21 days . Cognitive functions were assessed by using Morris water maze and passive avoidance task . Levels of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , nitrite , reduced glutathione ( DB00143 ) , and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) activity were determined to check oxidative stress and cholinergic function . Cytokine levels ( IL-1β and P01375 -α ) were also determined as markers of neuroinflammation . Administration of Q11206 caused a significant increase in P22303 activity and cognitive dysfunction . Increased oxidative stress and the proinflammatory cytokine levels were also observed following Q11206 administration in rats . DB04725 treatment attenuated Q11206 -induced cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive deficit in rats . In addition , licofelone attenuated Q11206 -induced oxidative stress and elevated cytokine levels . The cognitive enhancement following licofelone administration in Q11206 rats may be due to its ability to restore cholinergic functions or its antioxidant activity . These observed results suggest the therapeutic potential of dual P36551 /5- P28300 inhibitors in neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress and cognitive impairment .
