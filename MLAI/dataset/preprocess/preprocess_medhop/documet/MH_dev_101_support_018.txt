Somatic mutations affect key pathways in lung adenocarcinoma . Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours . Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas . DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples . Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis . The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases , among them the P00533 homologue Q15303 ; multiple ephrin receptor genes , notably P29320 ; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor P35968 ; and NTRK genes . These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers -- including P21359 , P25054 , P06400 and Q13315 -- and for sequence changes in P23468 as well as the frequently deleted gene Q9NZR2 . The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features , smoking status and DNA repair defects . These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array . Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma , and suggest new molecular targets for treatment .
