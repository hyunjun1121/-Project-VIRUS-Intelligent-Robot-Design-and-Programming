Early vitamin E supplementation attenuates diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction and the rise in protein kinase C-beta in mesenteric artery and ameliorates wall stiffness in femoral artery of Wistar rats . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : The impact of early vitamin E supplementation on vascular function in diabetes remains unresolved . Therefore , we examined the effects of vitamin E on functional and structural parameters and on chemical markers that are disturbed in diabetes in mesenteric and femoral arteries . METHODS : Segments of both arteries , taken from control and 8-week-old streptozotocin diabetic Wistar rats that were treated or not with vitamin E , were mounted on wire and pressure myographs , after which endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation was assessed . Passive mechanical wall properties and the localisation and levels of protein kinase C ( PKC ) -beta(2) and P51606 were evaluated in these vessels . RESULTS : DB00163 supplementation was associated with improved endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation in mesenteric arteries from diabetic rats . Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in diabetic mesenteric vessels was associated with P05771 (2) up-regulation and this was prevented by vitamin E supplementation . Increased P51606 accumulation and plasma isoprostane levels in diabetic rats were not changed by vitamin E . In the femoral artery , vitamin E supplementation had no effect on endothelium-dependent or -independent vasodilatation , but did prevent the wall stiffening associated with diabetes . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : Early vitamin E supplementation has a beneficial effect on diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction in resistance arteries . This benefit may arise from a direct effect on smooth muscle function , as a result of inhibition of the P05771 (2) isoform by vitamin E .
