Development of [18F]afatinib as new TKI-PET tracer for P00533 positive tumors . INTRODUCTION : DB08916 is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that was approved for the treatment of P00533 mutated non-small cell lung cancer in 2013 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) with fluorine-18 labeled afatinib provides a means to obtain improved understanding of afatinib tumor disposition in vivo . PET imaging with [(18)F]afatinib may also provide a method to select treatment responsive patients . The aim of this study was to label afatinib with fluorine-18 and evaluate its potential as TKI-PET tracer in tumor bearing mice . METHODS : A radiochemically novel coupling , using peptide coupling reagent BOP , was explored and optimized to synthesize [(18)F]afatinib , followed by a metabolite analysis and biodistribution studies in two clinically relevant lung cancer cell lines , xenografted in nude mice . RESULTS : A reliable [(18)F]afatinib radiosynthesis was developed and the tracer could be produced in yields of 17.0 Â± 2.5 % calculated from [(18)F]F(-) and > 98 % purity . The identity of the product was confirmed by co-injection on HPLC with non-labeled afatinib . Metabolite analysis revealed a moderate rate of metabolism , with > 80 % intact tracer in plasma at 45 min p.i . Biodistribution studies revealed rapid tumor accumulation and good retention for a period of at least 2 hours , while background tissues showed rapid clearance of the tracer . CONCLUSION : We have developed a method to synthesize [(18)F]afatinib and related fluorine-18 labeled 4-anilinoquinazolines . [(18)F] DB08916 showed good stability in vivo , justifying further evaluation as a TKI-PET tracer .
