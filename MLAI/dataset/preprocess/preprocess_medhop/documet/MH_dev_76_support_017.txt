DB01373 -sensing receptor gene polymorphism Arg990Gly and its possible effect on response to cinacalcet HCl . DB01012 , a novel calcimimetic compound , is effective in reducing parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) levels in approximately 70 % of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism . However , interindividual variations in the dose required to achieve the treatment goal have been noted in clinical studies . Our investigation examined the genetic polymorphisms of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) gene as one possible cause of the different responses to cinacalcet . We report data on seven end-stage renal failure patients who were treated with regular haemodialysis and who participated in clinical trials of cinacalcet . All patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism with baseline intact PTH ( iPTH ) levels greater than 600 pg/ml . Three patients were male and four female with a mean+/-SD age of 60+/-12 years . DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes . An area in exon 7 of the P41180 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced . Mean+/-SD baseline iPTH was 1086+/-189 pg/ml . The five patients without Arg990Gly demonstrated a 29.7+/-4.0 % ( +/-SEM ) reduction in iPTH from individual baseline . One patient was found to be homozygous for the Arg990Gly polymorphism and another was heterozygous for both arginine and glycine alleles . The homozygous patient showed a significantly higher sensitivity to cinacalcet compared to the other patients ( P=0.003 ) with a 76.3+/-7.7 % reduction in iPTH from baseline . No polymorphisms were noted in codons 986 or 1011 . This preliminary study points to the possibility that patients homozygous for glycine at the 990 position in exon 7 of the P41180 may be more sensitive to the calcimimetic drug cinacalcet compared to those who are homozygous for arginine at that location .
