Cytotoxic effects of fascaplysin against small cell lung cancer cell lines . Fascaplysin , the natural product of a marine sponge , exhibits anticancer activity against a broad range of tumor cells , presumably through interaction with DNA , and/or as a highly selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( P11802 ) inhibitor . In this study , cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin against a panel of small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cell lines and putative synergism with chemotherapeutics was investigated . SCLC responds to first-line chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs/etoposide , but relapses early with topotecan remaining as the single approved therapeutic agent . Fascaplysin was found to show high cytotoxicity against SCLC cells and to induce cell cycle arrest in P55008 /0 at lower and S-phase at higher concentrations , respectively . The compound generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and induced apoptotic cell death in the chemoresistant NCI-H417 SCLC cell line . Furthermore , fascaplysin revealed marked synergism with the topoisomerase I-directed camptothecin and 10-hydroxy-camptothecin . The Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase 1 ( P09874 ) inhibitor Q06418 204165 antagonized the cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin , pointing to the involvement of DNA repair in response to the anticancer activity of the drug . In conclusion , fascaplysin seems to be suitable for treatment of SCLC , based on high cytotoxic activity through multiple routes of action , affecting topoisomerase I , integrity of DNA and generation of ROS .
