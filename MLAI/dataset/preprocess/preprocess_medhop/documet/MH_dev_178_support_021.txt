Identification of novel androgen receptor antagonists using structure- and ligand-based methods . P10275 ( AR ) plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) . The AR hormone-binding site ( HBS ) is intensively studied and represents the target area for current antiandrogens including DB01128 and structurally related DB08899 . As resistance to antiandrogens invariably emerges in advanced prostate cancer , there exists a high medical need for the identification and development of novel AR antagonists of different chemotypes . Given the wealth of structural information on the AR in complex with a variety of ligands , we have applied an integrated structure- and ligand-based virtual screening methodology to identify novel AR antagonists . Virtual hits generated by a consensus voting approach were experimentally evaluated and resulted in the discovery of a number of structurally diverse submicromolar antagonists of the AR . In particular , one identified compound demonstrated anti-AR potency in vitro that is comparable to the clinically used DB01128 . These results set a ground for the development of novel classes of PCa drugs that are structurally different from current AR antagonists .
