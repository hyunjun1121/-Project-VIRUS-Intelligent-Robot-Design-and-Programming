DB08916 and its encapsulated polymeric micelles inhibits P04626 -overexpressed colorectal tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo . Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is known as a common malignant neoplasm worldwide . The role of P00533 / P04626 in CRC is unclear . DB08916 is an irreversible P00533 / P04626 inhibitor . There were few studies of afatinib on CRC . Here , we investigated the protein levels/expressions of P04626 in sera and tumors from CRC patients and the therapeutic effect of afatinib on P04626 -overexpressed CRC in vitro and in vivo . The increased P04626 levels were detected in the collected sera and tumors of patients with CRC . The serological P04626 levels were correlated with the tumor P04626 expressions in patients . DB08916 also inhibited the P04626 -positive tumor cell growth and caused apoptosis in P04626 -overexpressed human colorectal cancer HCT-15 cells but not in low P04626 expressed human gastric cancer MKN45 cells . In vivo study showed that afatinib reduced tumor growth in P04626 -overexpressed xenografts . Moreover , afatinib-encapsulated micelles displayed higher cytotoxic activity in HCT-15 cells and were more effective for tumor growth suppression in HCT-15-induced tumor xenografts than afatinib performance alone . Taken together , these findings suggest that higher serum P04626 levels reflect the higher P04626 contents in tumors of CRC patients , and the improved afatinib-encapsulated micelles possess high therapeutic efficacy in P04626 -overexpressed CRC in vitro and in vivo .
