Phorbol ester-mediated desensitization of histamine H1 receptors on a cultured smooth muscle cell line . The present study was undertaken in order to examine the effect of protein kinase C ( PKC ) on histamine H1 receptors ( P35367 ) present on the smooth muscle cell line , DDT1MF-2 . [ 3H ] - DB06691 binding revealed that specific [ 3H ] - DB06691 binding sites were reduced by pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , an activator of PKC , but not the Kd . The TPA analogue , 4 alpha phorbol 12,13-didecanoate , which does not activate PKC , failed to induce down-regulation of P35367 . TPA-induced down-regulation of P35367 was inhibited by pretreatment with 1-(5-Isoquinilinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride ( H-7 ) , a PKC inhibitor , in a dose dependent manner . The H-7 analogue , H-8 , which is a less potent inhibitor of PKC , but a potent inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide dependent protein kinase , had no effect on P35367 . Moreover , treatment with TPA inhibited histamine-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in cells loaded with the fluorescent indicator , indo-1 . These data suggest that P35367 in DDT1MF-2 cells are functionally regulated by PKC .
