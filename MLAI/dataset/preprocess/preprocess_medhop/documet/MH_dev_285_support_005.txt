DB00877 selectively blocks interleukin-2-induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene expression in T lymphocyte . Evidence for inhibition of CREB/ P39905 binding activities . The macrolide rapamycin arrests T lymphocytes stimulated by interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) at P55008 /S . We have recently found that P60568 induced an increase in the binding of discrete transcription factors of the P39905 / DB02527 -responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) family at P55008 /S , and that this effect was inhibited by rapamycin ( Feuerstein , N. , Huang , D. , Hinrichs , S. H. , Orten , D. J. , Aiyar , N. , and Prystowsky , M. B. ( 1995 ) J. Immunol. 154 , 68-79 ) . We now show , by using high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , that rapamycin inhibited selectively the synthesis of three discrete P60568 -induced soluble proteins ( 35 kDa/pI approximately 5 , 68 kDa/pI approximately 4 , 110 kDa/pI approximately 4.3 ) . Analysis of nuclear proteins demonstrated that rapamycin selectively blocked the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , an obligate cofactor of DNA polymerase-delta , an important component for DNA replication . DB00877 inhibited the P60568 -induced P12004 mRNA , and the murine P12004 promoter activity in P60568 -stimulated cells . Inducible CRE-binding proteins were shown previously to be required for P12004 promoter activity in P60568 -stimulated T lymphocytes . Using DNA binding gel mobility shift assay we demonstrated that rapamycin potently inhibited the binding of CREB/ P39905 transcription factors to CRE elements in the murine proximal P12004 promoter . These results suggest that P12004 is a preferred target in a rapamycin-sensitive transduction pathway , and that the mechanism by which rampamycin inhibits P12004 gene expression may involve the inhibition of the interaction of CREB/ P39905 transcription factors with CRE elements in the proximal P12004 promoter .
