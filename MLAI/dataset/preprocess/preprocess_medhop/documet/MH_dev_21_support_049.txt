Effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on behavior and key members of the brain serotonin system in mouse strains genetically predisposed to behavioral disorders . The effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( P39905 ) on behavior and on the serotonin ( 5-HT ) system of a mouse strain predisposed to depressive-like behavior , ASC/Icg ( Antidepressant Sensitive Cataleptics ) , in comparison with the parental " nondepressive " CBA/Lac mice was studied . Within 7 days after acute administration , P39905 ( 800 ng , i.c.v. ) decreased cataleptic immobility but increased depressive-like behavioral traits in both investigated mouse strains and produced anxiolytic effects in ASC mice . The expression of the gene encoding the key enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis in the brain , tryptophan hydroxylase-2 ( Tph-2 ) , and P08908 receptor gene in the midbrain as well as 5- Q13049 receptor gene in the frontal cortex were increased in P39905 -treated ASC mice . At the same time , P39905 decreased P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor gene expression in the hippocampus of ASC mice . P39905 failed to change Tph2 , P08908 , or 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA levels in CBA mice as well as 5-HT transporter gene expression and P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor functional activity in both investigated mouse strains . The results show 1 ) a P39905 -induced increase in the expression of key genes of the brain 5-HT system , Tph2 , P08908 , and 5- Q13049 receptors , and 2 ) significant genotype-dependent differences in the 5-HT system response to P39905 treatment . The data suggest that genetically defined cross-talk between neurotrophic factors and the brain 5-HT system underlies the variability in behavioral response to P39905 .
