P01308 signaling inhibits the P28335 receptor in choroid plexus via Q96HU1 kinase . BACKGROUND : G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) interact with heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins ( G proteins ) to modulate acute changes in intracellular messenger levels and ion channel activity . In contrast , long-term changes in cellular growth , proliferation and differentiation are often mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors and certain GPCRs by activation of mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases . Complex interactions occur between these signaling pathways , but the specific mechanisms of such regulatory events are not well-understood . In particular it is not clear whether GPCRs are modulated by tyrosine kinase receptor- Q96HU1 kinase pathways . RESULTS : Here we describe tyrosine kinase receptor regulation of a GPCR via Q96HU1 kinase . P01308 reduced the activity of the P28335 receptor in choroid plexus cells which was blocked by the Q96HU1 kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , PD 098059 . We demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of insulin and insulin-like growth factor type 1 ( DB01277 ) on the P28335 receptor is dependent on tyrosine kinase , DB01367 and Q96HU1 kinase . The effect may be receptor-specific : insulin had no effect on another GPCR that shares the same G protein signaling pathway as the P28335 receptor . This effect is also direct : activated Q96HU1 kinase mimicked the effect of insulin , and removing a putative Q96HU1 kinase site from the P28335 receptor abolished the effect of insulin . CONCLUSION : These results show that insulin signaling can inhibit P28335 receptor activity and suggest that Q96HU1 kinase may play a direct role in regulating the function of a specific GPCR .
