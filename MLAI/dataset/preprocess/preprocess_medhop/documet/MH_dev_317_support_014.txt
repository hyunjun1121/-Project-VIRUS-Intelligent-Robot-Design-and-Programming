Mapping of the regulatory subunits RI beta and RII beta of DB02527 -dependent protein kinase genes on human chromosome 7 . The genes encoding the regulatory subunits RI beta ( locus P31321 ) and RII beta ( locus P31323 ) of human DB02527 -dependent protein kinase have been mapped in the basic CEPH ( Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain ) family panel of 40 families to chromosome 7p and 7q , respectively , using the enzymes HindIII and BanII recognizing the corresponding restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) . Previous data from the CEPH database and our present RFLP data were used to construct a six-point local framework map including P31321 and a seven-point framework map including P31323 . The analysis placed P31321 as the most distal of the hitherto mapped 7p marker loci and resulted in an unequivocal order of pter- P31321 -D7S21-D7S108-D7S17-D7S149- D7S62-cen , with a significantly higher rate of male than female recombination between P31321 and D7S21 . The 7q regulatory gene locus , P31323 , could also be placed in an unambigous order with regard to the existing CEPH database 7q marker loci , the resulting order being cen-D7S371-( P08123 ,D7S79)- P31323 -MET-D7S87++ +-TCRB-qter . Furthermore , in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes physically mapped P31323 to band q22 on chromosome 7 .
