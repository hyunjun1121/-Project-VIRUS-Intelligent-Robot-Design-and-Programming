Disruption of Src function potentiates Chk1-inhibitor-induced apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo . Ras/MEK/ P29323 pathway activation represents an important compensatory response of human multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells to checkpoint kinase 1 ( Chk1 ) inhibitors . To investigate the functional roles of Src in this event and potential therapeutic significance , interactions between Src and Chk1 inhibitors ( eg , P55089 -01 or Chk1i ) were examined in vitro and in vivo . The dual Src/Abl inhibitors BMS354825 and DB06616 blocked Chk1-inhibitor-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) activation , markedly increasing apoptosis in association with BimEL up-regulation , p34(cdc2) activation , and DNA damage in MM cell lines and primary CD138(+) MM samples . Loss-of-function Src mutants ( K297R , K296R/Y528F ) or shRNA knock-down of Src prevented the P27361 /2 activation induced by Chk1 inhibitors and increased apoptosis . Conversely , constitutively active Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase/ P29323 kinase 1 ( Q02750 ) significantly diminished the ability of Src inhibitors to potentiate Chk1-inhibitor lethality . Moreover , Src/Chk1-inhibitor cotreatment attenuated MM-cell production of vascular endothelial growth factor and other angiogenic factors ( eg , P03950 [ angiogenin ] , P01033 /2 [ tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1/2 ] , and RANTES [ regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted ] ) , and inhibited in vitro angiogenesis . Finally , coadministration of BMS354825 and P55089 -01 suppressed human MM tumor growth in a murine xenograft model , increased apoptosis , and diminished angiogenesis . These findings suggest that Src kinase is required for Chk1-inhibitor-mediated Ras â†’ P27361 /2 signaling activation , and that disruption of this event sharply potentiates the anti-MM activity of Chk1 inhi-bitors in vitro and in vivo .
