Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma increases estrogen receptor-dependent tumor specification . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor that regulates gene transcription associated with intermediary metabolism , adipocyte differentiation , and tumor suppression and proliferation . To understand the role of PPARgamma in tumorigenesis , transgenic mice were generated with mammary gland-directed expression of the dominant-negative transgene Pax8PPARgamma . Transgenic mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type ( WT ) mice , but mammary epithelial cells expressed a greater percentage of CD29(hi)/ P25063 (neg) , CK5(+) , and double-positive CK14/CK18 cells . These changes correlated with reduced P60484 and increased Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and AKT activation . Although spontaneous tumorigenesis did not occur , transgenic animals were highly susceptible to progestin/7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced mammary carcinogenesis , which in contrast to WT mice resulted in a high tumor multiplicity and , most importantly , in the appearance of predominantly estrogen receptor alpha-positive ( ER(+) ) ductal adenocarcinomas . Tumors expressed a similar P60484 (lo)/pERK(hi)/pAKT(hi) phenotype as mammary epithelium and exhibited high activation of estrogen response element-dependent reporter gene activity . Tumorigenesis in MMTV-Pax8PPARgamma mice was insensitive to the chemopreventive effect of a PPARgamma agonist but was profoundly inhibited by the ER antagonist fulvestrant . These results reveal important new insights into the previously unrecognized role of PPARgamma in the specification of mammary lineage and the development of ER(+) tumors .
