Common genetic variants contribute to primary hypertriglyceridemia without differences between familial combined hyperlipidemia and isolated hypertriglyceridemia . BACKGROUND : The majority of hypertriglyceridemias are diagnosed as familial combined hyperlipidemia ( FCHL ) and primary isolated hypertriglyceridemias . The contribution of common genetic variants in primary hypertriglyceridemias and the genetic difference between FCHL and isolated hypertriglyceridemias have not been thoroughly examined . METHODS AND RESULTS : This study involved 580 patients with hypertriglyceridemias and 403 controls . Of the 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms examined , 12 located in 10 genes showed allelic and genotype frequency differences between hypertriglyceridemias and controls . The minor alleles of P02649 , Q6Q788 , GALNTN2 , and Q14397 variants were positively correlated with plasma triglycerides , whereas minor alleles of Q86V24 , Q9Y5C1 , P06858 , and Q96RU8 polymorphisms were inversely associated . Body mass index , glucose , sex , rs328 and rs7007797 in P06858 , rs662799 and rs3135506 in Q6Q788 , and rs1260326 in Q14397 explained 36 % of the variability in plasma triglycerides , 7.3 % of which was attributable to the genetic variables . P06858 , Q14397 , and Q6Q788 polymorphisms fit dominant , recessive , and additive inheritance models , respectively . Variants more frequently identified in isolated hypertriglyceridemias were rs7412 in P02649 and rs1800795 in P05231 ; rs2808607 in P22680 and rs3812316 and rs17145738 in Q9NP71 were more frequent in FCHL . The other 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms presented similar frequencies between isolated hypertriglyceridemias and FCHL . CONCLUSIONS : Common genetic variants found in P06858 , Q6Q788 , and Q14397 are associated with triglycerides levels in patients with primary hypertriglyceridemias . FCHL and isolated hypertriglyceridemias are probably trace to an accumulation of genetic variants predisposing to familial and sporadic hypertriglyceridemias or to hypertriglyceridemias and hypercholesterolemia in case of FCHL .
