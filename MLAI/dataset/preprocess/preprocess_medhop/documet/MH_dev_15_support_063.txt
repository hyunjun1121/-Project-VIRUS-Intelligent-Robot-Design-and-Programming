Adjuvant effects of formalin-inactivated HSV through activation of dendritic cells and inactivation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer immunotherapy . Use of adequate adjuvant is necessary for induction of effective antitumor immune responses . To develop an effective adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy , we selected formalin-inactivated (f)-HSV as an adjuvant component , and analyzed the mechanisms underlying its adjuvant effects . First , we found that f-HSV can induce the tumor antigen-specific CTLs by enhancing antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells ( DCs ) , mainly through O60603 , but not Q9NR96 . Next , f-HSV was also found to prevent the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) . We demonstrated that the expansion of MDSCs in the blood and spleen during tumor progression required B cells producing the inflammatory angiogenesis factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -A and neuropilin-1 ( NRP-1 ) , a co-receptor for P15692 receptor-2 ( P35968 ) . Interestingly , the transmembrane-type NRP-1 on B cells changed to soluble-type NRP-1 ( sNRP-1 ) by f-HSV treatment . We further showed that the sNRP-1 and P15692 secreted from B cells by f-HSV treatment could abrogate the immunosuppressive ability of MDSCs . These results suggest that f-HSV can enhance antitumor immune responses as an adjuvant , not only through activation of DCs , but also inactivation of MDSCs via B cells .
