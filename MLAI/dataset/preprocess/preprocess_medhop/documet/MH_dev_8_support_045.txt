P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors : application in non-small cell lung cancer . Despite treatment advances over the past decade , long-term survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remains poor , and treatment options available after second-line therapy are limited . Increased understanding of cancer biology has led to the identification of several potential targets for treatment . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) belongs to a family of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases that controls many important cellular functions , from growth and proliferation to cell death . This receptor is a particularly promising therapeutic target because it often is overexpressed in patients with NSCLC and has been implicated in the pathogenesis as well as the proliferation , invasion , and metastasis of lung cancer and other malignancies . New agents developed to inhibit P00533 function include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors , monoclonal antibodies to P00533 , and pan- P00533 inhibitors . Completed and ongoing clinical trials have shown that P00533 inhibitors have remarkable efficacy for patients with relapsed NSCLC . Among these , two phase 2 trials have shown that ZD1839 is effective when used as monotherapy . The response rates are comparable with those for docetaxel given in the second-line setting . Another phase 2 trial has shown that DB00530 is effective in the same setting . Data from phase 3 trials indicate that adding an P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor to chemotherapy does not provide an additional survival benefit , as compared with standard chemotherapy alone for first-line treatment of NSCLC . It appears that P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are safe and well tolerated by patients with cancer . Further studies will elucidate how these new agents can best be used for NSCLC and other tumor types .
