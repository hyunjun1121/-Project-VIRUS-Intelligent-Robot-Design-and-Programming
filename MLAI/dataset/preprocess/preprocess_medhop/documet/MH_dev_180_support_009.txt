Tp53-associated growth arrest and DNA damage repair gene expression is attenuated in mammary epithelial cells of rats fed whey proteins . Dietary protection from mammary cancer is likely coordinated through multiple signaling pathways , based on the known heterogeneity of the disease and the distinct origins of mammary tumor cells . The present study examined the modulatory effects of dietary intake of whey protein hydrolysate ( WPH ) relative to casein ( CAS ) , on mammary epithelial cell resistance to endogenous DNA damage using Tp53 gene expression and signaling as a read-out , and on systemic proapoptotic and immune surveillance activity , in young adult female Sprague-Dawley rats . Rats were fed AIN-93G diets made with CAS or WPH as the sole protein source beginning at gestation d 4 . At postnatal day ( P01160 ) 50 , mammary glands of rats fed WPH had lower levels of activated Tp53 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins , and reduced transcript levels for Tp53-associated DNA damage repair , growth arrest , and proapoptotic genes than those of CAS-fed rats . Serum from WPH-fed rats had greater apoptotic activity in MCF-7 tumor cells than that from rats fed CAS . Serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 were higher in WPH- than in CAS-fed rats . MCF-7 cells treated with CAS serum + recombinant rat P13500 had apoptotic activity and Tp53 and P38936 gene expression levels comparable to those treated with WPH serum or recombinant P13500 . Results indicate that mammary glands of rats fed a WPH diet are more protected from endogenous DNA damage than are those of CAS-fed rats , and identify P13500 as a potential serum biomarker for the positive effects of healthy diets .
