The basal subcellular distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase is independent of G-protein beta gamma subunits . beta-Adrenergic receptor kinase ( beta O14965 or P25098 ) is a key regulatory protein involved in the regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors which associates with microsomal and plasma membranes. beta gamma Subunits of G-proteins have been suggested to mediate agonist-dependent membrane translocation of beta ARK , but their possible role in maintaining the complex subcellular distribution of the kinase is not known . In this study we show that lovastatin-mediated inhibition of G gamma subunits isoprenylation in P29320 -293 cells stably transfected with beta O14965 leads to a significant release of G beta subunits to the cytosol without causing changes in total particulate beta ARK or in the association of this kinase to plasma or microsomal membrane fractions . In addition , transient overexpression of mutant forms of G gamma unable to become isoprenylated resulted in a marked sequestration of G beta to the soluble compartment , but caused no rearrangement in the distribution of cotransfected beta ARK . These results indicate that anchoring of beta ARK to cellular membranes under basal conditions is independent of the availability of heterotrimeric G-protein subunits .
