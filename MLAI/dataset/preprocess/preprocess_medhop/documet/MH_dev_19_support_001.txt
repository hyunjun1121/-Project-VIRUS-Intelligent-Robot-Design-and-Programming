Protein-repairing methionine sulfoxide reductases in photosynthetic organisms : gene organization , reduction mechanisms , and physiological roles . DB00134 oxidation to methionine sulfoxide ( MetSO ) is reversed by two types of methionine sulfoxide reductases ( MSRs ) , A and B , specific to the S- and R-diastereomers of MetSO , respectively . Q9UBK8 genes are found in most organisms from bacteria to human . In the current review , we first compare the organization of the Q9UBK8 gene families in photosynthetic organisms from cyanobacteria to higher plants . The analysis reveals that MSRs constitute complex families in higher plants , bryophytes , and algae compared to cyanobacteria and all non-photosynthetic organisms . We also perform a classification , based on gene number and structure , position of redox-active cysteines and predicted sub-cellular localization . The various catalytic mechanisms and potential physiological electron donors involved in the regeneration of Q9UBK8 activity are then described . Data available from higher plants reveal that MSRs fulfill an essential physiological function during environmental constraints through a role in protein repair and in protection against oxidative damage . Taking into consideration the expression patterns of Q9UBK8 genes in plants and the known roles of these genes in non-photosynthetic cells , other functions of MSRs are discussed during specific developmental stages and ageing in photosynthetic organisms .
