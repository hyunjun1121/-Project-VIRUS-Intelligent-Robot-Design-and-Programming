Wnt/beta-catenin and 3',5'-cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathways alterations and somatic beta-catenin gene mutations in the progression of adrenocortical tumors . BACKGROUND : The Wnt/beta-catenin and DB02527 signaling pathways play an important role in adrenal cortex tumorigenesis . Somatic activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene ( P35222 ) are the most frequent genetic defects identified both in adrenocortical adenomas ( ACAs ) and adrenocortical cancers ( ACCs ) . P10644 mutations leading to DB02527 pathway dysregulation are observed in primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical diseases ( PPNADs ) and some sporadic ACAs . OBJECTIVE : The objective of the investigation was to study Wnt/beta-catenin dysregulation in adrenocortical tumors ( ACTs ) with DB02527 pathway genetic alteration and search for secondary P35222 somatic mutations in heterogeneous tumors . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Nine PPNADs , including five with macronodules , three ACAs with P10644 somatic mutations , and one heterogeneous tumor with ACC developed within an ACA , were studied by immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing . RESULTS : beta-Catenin accumulation was observed in all PPNADs , ACAs with P10644 mutations , and the ACC component of the heterogeneous tumor . P35222 somatic activating mutations were found in the macronodule of two of the five macronodular PPNADs , in one ACA with a P10644 somatic mutation , and in the malignant part of the heterogeneous ACT . CONCLUSIONS : The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is activated in PPNADs and ACAs with P10644 mutations , suggesting a cross talk between the DB02527 and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways in ACT development . In addition , the occurrence as an additional hit of a P35222 somatic mutation is associated with larger or more aggressive ACTs . This underlines the importance of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in adrenal cortex tumorigenesis and the importance of genetic accumulation in the progression of ACTs .
