Human and mouse trace amine-associated receptor 1 have distinct pharmacology towards endogenous monoamines and imidazoline receptor ligands . TAARs ( trace amine-associated receptors ) are G-protein-coupled receptors that respond to low abundance , endogenous amines such as tyramine and tryptamine , and represent potential targets for neuropsychiatric diseases . However , some members of this receptor subfamily either have no ligand identified or remain difficult to express and characterize using recombinant systems . In the present paper we report the successful expression of human and mouse Q96RJ0 , and the characterization of their responses to various natural and synthetic agonists . In P29320 ( human embryonic kidney ) -293/CRE-bla cells , mouse Q96RJ0 showed a robust response to trace amines as measured using either a DB02527 assay or a beta-lactamase reporter assay , whereas human Q96RJ0 showed a weaker , but still measurable , response . When certain fragments of human Q96RJ0 were replaced with the corresponding regions of mouse Q96RJ0 , the chimaeric receptor showed a much stronger response in DB02527 production . Examination of a series of agonists on these receptors revealed that the human and the chimaeric receptor are almost identical in pharmacology , but distinct from the mouse receptor . We also screened small libraries of pharmacologically active agents on Q96RJ0 and identified a series of synthetic agonists , some of which are also ligands of the enigmatic imidazoline receptor . The findings of the present study not only shed light on the pharmacological species difference of Q96RJ0 , but also raise new possibilities about the mechanism of some of the imidazoline-related agents .
