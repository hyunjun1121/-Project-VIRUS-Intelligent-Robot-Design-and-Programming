Acute ethanol preexposure promotes liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice by activating P05091 . It is known that chronic ethanol significantly impairs liver regeneration . However , the effect of acute ethanol exposure on liver regeneration remains largely unknown . To address this question , C57Bl6/J mice were exposed to acute ethanol ( 6 g/kg intragastrically ) for 3 days , and partial hepatectomy ( PHx ) was performed 24 h after the last dose . Surprisingly , acute ethanol preexposure promoted liver regeneration . This effect of ethanol did not correlate with changes in expression of cell cycle regulatory genes ( e.g. , cyclin D1 , P38936 , and p27 ) but did correlate with protection against the effect of PHx on indices of impaired lipid and carbohydrate metabolism . DB00898 preexposure protected against inhibition of the oxidant-sensitive mitochondrial enzyme , aconitase . The activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( P05091 ) was significantly increased by ethanol preexposure . The effect of ethanol was blocked by inhibiting ( DB02115 ) and was mimicked by activating ( Alda-1 ) P05091 . Lipid peroxides are also substrates for P05091 ; indeed , alcohol preexposure blunted the increase in lipid peroxidation ( 4OH-nonenal adducts ) caused by PHx . Taken together , these data suggest that acute preoperative ethanol exposure " preconditions " the liver to respond more rapidly to regenerate after PHx by activating mitochondrial P05091 , which prevents oxidative stress in this compartment .
