Shared and unique genetic contributions to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders : a pilot study of six candidate genes . The shared genetic basis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and substance use disorders ( SUDs ) was explored by investigating the association of candidate risk factors in neurotransmitter genes with both disorders . One hundred seven methadone maintenance treatment patients , 36 having an ADHD diagnosis , 176 adult patients with ADHD without SUDs , and 500 healthy controls were genotyped for variants in the P21917 ( exon 3 VNTR ) , P21918 ( upstream VNTR ) , P28222 ( rs6296 ) , P09172 ( rs2519152 ) , P21964 ( rs4680 ; Val158Met ) , and P35372 ( rs1799971 ; 118A > G ) genes . Association with disease was tested using logistic regression models . This pilot study was adequately powered to detect larger genetic effects ( ORâ‰¥2 ) of risk alleles with a low frequency . Compared to controls , ADHD patients ( with and without SUDs ) showed significantly increased frequency of the P09172 ( rs2519152 : OR 1.73 ; CI 1.15-2.59 ; P=0.008 ) and the P35372 risk genotypes ( rs1799971 : OR 1.71 ; CI 1.17-2.50 ; P=0.006 ) . The P09172 risk genotype was associated with ADHD diagnosis , with the association strongest in the pure ADHD group . The P35372 risk genotype increased the risk for the combined ADHD and SUD phenotype . The present study strengthens the evidence for a shared genetic basis for ADHD and addiction . The association of P35372 with the ADHD and SUD combination could help to explain the contradictory results of previous studies . The power limitations of the study restrict the significance of these findings : replication in larger samples is warranted .
