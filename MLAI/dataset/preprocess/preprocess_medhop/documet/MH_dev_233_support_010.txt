Influence of CHIEF pathway genes on gene expression : a pathway approach to functionality . BACKGROUND : Candidate pathway approaches in disease association studies often utilize a tagSNP approach to capture genetic variation . In this paper we assess gene expression patterns with SNPs in genes in the CHIEF pathway to help determine their potential functionality . METHODS : Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was run to determine gene expression of 13 genes in normal colon tissue samples from 82 individuals . TagSNP genotype data were obtained from a GoldenGate Illumina multiplex bead array platform . Age , sex , and genetic ancestry adjusted general linear models were used to estimate beta coefficients and p values . RESULTS : Genetic variation in P42345 ( 1 SNP ) , P19838 ( 4 SNPs ) , Q9UGJ0 ( 3 SNPs ) , and P49815 ( 1 SNP ) significantly influenced their expression . After adjustment for multiple comparisons several associations between pathway genes and expression of other genes were significant . These included P31749 rs1130214 associated with expression of PDK1 ; NFκB1 rs13117745 and rs4648110 with Q15831 expression ; Q9UGJ0 rs6965771 with expression of NFκB1 , P42336 , and Q9UBS0 ; P23443 rs80711475 with Q15831 expression ; Q15831 rs741765 with P42336 and Q9UGJ0 expression ; and P49815 rs3087631 with P31749 , IkBκB , NFκB1 , PDK1 , P42336 , Q9UGJ0 , and P60484 expression . The higher levels of differential expression were noted for P49815 rs3087631 ( percent difference ranges from 108 % to 198 % across genes ) . Many of these SNPs and genes also were associated with colon and rectal cancer risk . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that pathway genes may regulate expression of other genes in the pathway . The convergence of these genes in several biological pathways involved in cancer further supports their importance to the carcinogenic process .
