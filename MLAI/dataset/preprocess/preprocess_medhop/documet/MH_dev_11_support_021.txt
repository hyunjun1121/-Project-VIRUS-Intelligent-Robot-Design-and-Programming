Loss of Jak2 impairs endothelial function by attenuating P04049 / Q02750 /Sp-1 signaling along with altered P29474 activities . A number of inhibitors have been used to dissect the functional relevance of Jak2 in endothelial homeostasis , with disparate results . Given that Jak2 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality , the exact role of Jak2 in the regulation of postnatal endothelial function is yet to be fully elucidated . We generated a model in which Jak2 deficiency can be induced by tamoxifen in adult mice . Loss of Jak2 significantly impaired endothelium-dependent response capacity for vasodilators . Matrigel plug assays indicated a notable decrease in endothelial angiogenic function in Jak2-deficient mice . Studies in a hindlimb ischemic model indicated that Jak2 activity is likely to be a prerequisite for prompt perfusion recovery , based on the concordance of temporal changes in Jak2 expression during the course of ischemic injury and perfusion recovery . A remarkable delay in perfusion recovery , along with reduced capillary and arteriole formation , was observed in Jak2-deficient mice . Antibody array studies indicated that loss of Jak2 led to repressed P29474 expression . In mechanistic studies , Jak2 deficiency attenuated P04049 / Q02750 signaling , which then reduced activity of Sp-1 , an essential transcription factor responsible for P29474 expression . These data are important not only for understanding the exact role that Jak2 plays in endothelial homeostasis , but also for assessing Jak2-based therapeutic strategies in a variety of clinical settings .
