[ Thrombotic complications following the treatment of multiple myeloma with new agents ] . Patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) are at an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis . The risk factors and pathomechanisms for thrombotic complications in multiple myeloma patients can be divided into the disease-related and treatment-specific risk factors . With the introduction of novel therapies , including talidomide , lenalidomide and bortezomib , the outcomes of the patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated multiple myeloma have improved , however the treatment affected the prothrombotic and anticoagulant processes . The risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) in patients receiving immunomodulatory agent-based regimens ( thalidomide or lenalidomide ) , especially when used in combination with high-dose deamethasone- and/or anthracycline-based chemiotherapy is high . The proposed mechanisms for prothrombotic state include changes in P04275 , factor VIII , thrombomodulin , P25116 and P35354 epression , and some abnormalities in transcription factors and genetic risk factors . Moreover , dysregulation of anticoagulation and impairment of fibrinolysis may also contribute to hypercoagulability state . The incidence of VTE in bortezomib-containing regimens is very low . It may be due to inhibitory effect of bortezomib on platelet aggregation and NF-kappa/beta . This article presents the latest outlook upon the pathogenesis of thrombotic complications in multiple myeloma patients undergoing the therapy with new agents .
