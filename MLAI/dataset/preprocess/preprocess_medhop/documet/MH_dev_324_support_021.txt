P35372 -dependent and independent components in effects of tramadol . DB00193 is thought to induce analgesia via both opioid and non-opioid pathways , although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated . In this study , we investigated the roles of the mu-opioid receptor ( MOP ) in analgesic and rewarding effects of tramadol by using MOP knockout ( KO ) mice . DB00193 -induced antinociception , assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests , was significantly reduced in heterozygous and homozygous MOP-KO mice when compared with that in wild-type mice . Interestingly , however , tramadol retained its ability to induce significant antinociception in homozygous MOP-KO mice . The tramadol-induced antinociception remaining in homozygous MOP-KO mice was not significantly affected by methysergide , a serotonin receptor antagonist , but was partially blocked by yohimbine , an adrenaline alpha2 receptor antagonist , and both naloxone , a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist , and yohimbine . In addition , antinociceptive effects of an active tramadol metabolite M1 were abolished or remarkably reduced in MOP-KO mice . On the other hand , neither wild-type nor homozygous MOP-KO mice showed significant place preference for tramadol in a conditioned place preference test , although there were slight tendencies toward preference in wild-type mice and avoidance in homozygous MOP-KO mice . These results strongly support the idea suggested in the previous pharmacological studies that MOP and the adrenaline alpha2 receptor mediate most of the analgesic properties of tramadol .
