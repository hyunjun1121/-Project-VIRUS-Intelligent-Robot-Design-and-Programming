DB00163 and drug metabolism . Tocopherols and tocotrienols are metabolized by side chain degradation initiated by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) -catalyzed omega-hydroxylation followed by beta-oxidation . Whereas DB00163 is only poorly metabolized , high amounts of the final products , carboxyethyl hydroxychroman ( CEHC ) , are found from other tocols in HepG2 cells and in human urine . P08684 and P78329 were suggested to be involved in tocopherol degradation . P08684 metabolizes most of the drugs and is induced by many of its substrates via the activation of the pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) . Also tocopherols and in particular tocotrienols induce the expression of a O75469 -driven reporter gene and the expression of endogenous P08684 and P20815 which is supported by sporadic publications spread over the last 30 years . The potential interference of vitamin E with drug metabolism is discussed in the light of related complications evoked by herbal remedies .
