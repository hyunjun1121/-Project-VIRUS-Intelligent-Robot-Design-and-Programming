The importance of synapsin I and II for neurotransmitter levels and vesicular storage in cholinergic , glutamatergic and GABAergic nerve terminals . The aim of this study was to examine the importance of the vesicle-associated synapsin I and II phosphoproteins for the accumulation of neurotransmitters in central cholinergic as compared to central glutamatergic and GABAergic nerve terminals . In brain homogenate samples from mice devoid of synapsin I and II , the levels of vesicular transporters for glutamate ( Q9P2U7 -2 ) and GABA ( Q9H598 ) were decreased by 35-40 % in striatum and cortex , while no change was apparent for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( Q16572 ) . The severe decrease in the levels of amino acid vesicular transporters caused only minor changes in the concentrations of the respective neurotransmitters in homogenates of the three selected brain areas from synapsin I- and II-deficient mice . However , when measured in a crude vesicular fraction , the concentrations of glutamate and GABA were decreased by 48-60 % in synapsin-deficient mice , with a similar decrease in the levels of Q9P2U7 , Q9P2U8 and Q9H598 . In comparison , the concentration of acetylcholine and the level of Q16572 were not significantly different from wild-type in the vesicular fraction . No changes were seen in the activity of specific enzymes involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine , glutamate or GABA , however , immunoblotting indicated a decrease in the protein level of glutamic acid decarboxylase , isoform 65 ( Q99259 (65) ) . In conclusion , the results indicate that neurotransmitter regulation in central cholinergic synapses may be less dependent on synapsin I and II compared to the marked alterations seen in the glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses .
