Functional mapping of cannabinoid receptor homologs in mammals , other vertebrates , and invertebrates . Over the past decade , several putative homologs of cannabinoid receptors ( CBRs ) have been identified by homology screening . Homology screening utilizes sequence alignment search engines to recognize homologs . We investigated these putative P16152 homologs further by ' functional mapping ' of their deduced amino acid sequences . The entire pharmacophore of a P16152 has not yet been elucidated , but point-mutation studies have identified over 20 amino acid residues that impart P16152 specificity for ligand recognition and/or signal transduction . Twenty point-mutation studies were used to construct a P16152 functionality matrix . Sixteen putative P16152 homologs were then mapped over the matrix . Several putative homologs did not hold up to this analysis : human P46089 , P46095 , P47775 , and Caenorhabditis elegans C02H7.2 expressed a series of crippling substitutions in the matrix , strongly suggesting they do not encode functional CBRs . Mapping the contested leech ( Hirudo medicinalis ) P16152 sequence suggests that it encodes a functional P21554 ; it expresses fewer substitutions than the sea squirt ( Ciona intestinalis ) P21554 sequence . Mapping a putative CB2 ortholog in the puffer fish ( Fugu rubripes T012234 ) suggests it may encode a P16152 other than CB2 . These findings are consistent with the lack of experimental data proving these putative CBRs have affinity for cannabinoid ligands . Matrix analysis also reveals that SR144528 , a ' CB2-specific ' synthetic antagonist , has affinity for non-mammalian P21554 receptors , and that Q96MH2 .45 appears to be CB2-specific , its cognate in P21554 receptors is P13726 .45 . In conclusion , functional mapping , utilizing point-mutation studies , may improve the specificity of homology screening performed by sequence alignment search engines .
