Role of endothelin in the maintenance of blood pressure in conscious rats with chronic heart failure . Acute effects of the endothelin receptor antagonist Ro 47-0203 ( DB00559 ) . BACKGROUND : Endothelin ( ET ) is a potent vasoconstrictor , and its concentration is increased in patients with heart failure . The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of endothelin in heart failure by use of a rat model . METHODS AND RESULTS : Experiments were performed on rats at 1 through 16 weeks after sham operation or coronary artery ligation . Rats with left ventricular end-diastolic pressures > 15 mm Hg were considered to have chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , while the others were considered to have uncomplicated myocardial infarction ( MI ) . There were increased ET-1 concentrations in CHF rats at weeks 1 to 16 ( Sham , 20 +/- 0.5 pg/mL , n = 45 ; CHF , 31 +/- 2 pg/mL , n = 50 ; P < .001 ) and transient increases in P14138 concentrations at week 1 in both the MI and CHF groups . There were no significant increases in big ET-1 concentrations , suggesting an increased conversion of ET-1 from big ET-1 in the CHF group . At weeks 2 through 8 , oral administration of the mixed ( P25101 and ETB ) endothelin receptor antagonist DB00559 significantly decreased mean arterial pressure in conscious CHF rats , an effect that increased over time . Furthermore , DB00559 had an additive effect to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril . CONCLUSIONS : Endothelin plays a role in the maintenance of blood pressure in CHF rats , as evidenced by the significant reduction in mean arterial pressure after oral administration of DB00559 . Therefore , endothelin antagonists may be useful therapeutic agents in the treatment of CHF .
