Vascular proinflammatory responses by aldosterone are mediated via c-Src trafficking to cholesterol-rich microdomains : role of P09619 . AIMS : We demonstrated c-Src activation as a novel non-genomic signalling pathway for aldosterone in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . Here , we investigated molecular mechanisms and biological responses of this phenomenon , focusing on the role of lipid rafts/caveolae and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) in c-Src-regulated proinflammatory responses by aldosterone . METHODS AND RESULTS : Studies were performed in cultured VSMCs from Wistar-Kyoto ( WKY ) rats and caveolin-1 knockout ( Cav 1(-/-) ) and wild-type mice . DB04630 stimulation increased c-Src phosphorylation and trafficking to lipid rafts/caveolae . DB04540 depletion with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin abrogated aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of c-Src and its target , Pyk2 . DB04630 effects were recovered by cholesterol reload . DB04630 -induced c-Src and cortactin phosphorylation was reduced in caveolin-1-silenced and Cav 1(-/-) VSMCs . P09619 is phosphorylated by aldosterone within cholesterol-rich fractions of VSMCs . AG1296 , a P09619 inhibitor , prevented c-Src phosphorylation and translocation to cholesterol-rich fractions . DB04630 induced an increase in adhesion molecule protein content and promoted monocyte adhesion to VSMCs , responses that were inhibited an by cholesterol depletion , caveolin-1 deficiency , AG1296 and Q99463 , a c-Src inhibitor . P08235 ( MR ) content in flotillin-2-rich fractions and co-immunoprecipitation with c-Src and P09619 increased upon aldosterone stimulation , indicating MR-lipid raft/signalling association . CONCLUSION : We demonstrate that aldosterone-mediated c-Src trafficking/activation and proinflammatory signalling involve lipid rafts/caveolae via P09619 .
