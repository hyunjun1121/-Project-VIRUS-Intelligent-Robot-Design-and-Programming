Inhibition of JAKs in macrophages increases lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production by blocking P22301 -mediated feedback . Macrophages are an important source of cytokines following infection . Stimulation of macrophages with TLR agonists results in the secretion of P01375 -α , P05231 , and IL-12 , and the production of these cytokines is controlled by multiple feedback pathways . Macrophages also produce P22301 , which acts to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages via a JAK/ P40763 -dependent pathway . We show in this paper that , DB08877 , a recently described selective inhibitor of JAKs , increases P01375 , P05231 , and IL-12 secretion in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with LPS . This effect is largely due to its ability to block P22301 -mediated feedback inhibition on cytokine transcription in macrophages . Similar results were also obtained with a second structurally unrelated Jak inhibitor , DB08895 . In addition , LPS induced the production of IFN-β , which was then able to activate JAKs in macrophages , resulting in the stimulation of P42224 phosphorylation . The initial induction of P22301 was independent of JAK signaling ; however , inhibition of JAKs did reduce P22301 secretion at later time points . This reflected a requirement for the IFN-β feedback loop to sustain P22301 transcription following LPS stimulation . In addition to P22301 , IFN-β also helped sustain P05231 and IL-12 transcription . Overall , these results suggest that inhibition of JAKs may increase the inflammatory potential of macrophages stimulated with O00206 agonists .
