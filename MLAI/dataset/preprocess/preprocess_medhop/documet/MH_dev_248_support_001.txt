[ Transport of mucoid mucus in healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis ] . OBJECTIVE : To characterise and compare the in vitro transport properties of respiratory mucoid secretion in individuals with no lung disease and in stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) and bronchiectasis . METHODOLOGY : Samples of mucus were collected , from 21 volunteers presenting no lung disease who had undergone surgery , from 10 patients presenting chronic P48444 , and from 16 patients with bronchiectasis . Mucociliary transport ( Q8IVS2 ) , transport by cough ( DB00919 ) , and contact angle ( P62158 ) were evaluated . RESULTS : Q8IVS2 was found to be greater in healthy individuals ( 1.0±0.19 ) than in P48444 ( 0.91±0.17 ) and bronchiectasis ( 0.76±0.23 ) patients ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas DB00919 was greater in P48444 patients ( 16.31±7.35 cm ) than in patients with bronchiectasis ( 12.16±6.64 cm ) and healthy individuals ( 10.50±25.8 cm ) ( p < 0.05 ) . No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding P62158 . CONCLUSION : Mucus from healthy individuals allows better mucociliary transport compared to that from patients with lung diseases . However , the mucus from P48444 patients allows a better transport by coughing , demonstrating that these individuals have adapted to a defence mechanism compared to patients with bronchiectasis , who have impairment in their ciliary and cough transport mechanisms .
