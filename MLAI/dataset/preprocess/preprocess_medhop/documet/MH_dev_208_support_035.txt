The cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 suppresses opioid-induced emesis in ferrets . BACKGROUND : Cannabinoid receptor agonists reverse nausea and vomiting produced by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in animals and humans but have not been tested against opioid-induced emesis . This study tests the hypothesis that cannabinoid receptor agonists will prevent opioid-induced vomiting . METHODS : Twelve male ferrets were used . They weighed 1. P35326 .6 kg at the beginning and 1.8-2.3 kg at the end of the experiments . All drugs were injected subcutaneously . WIN55,212-2 , a mixed P21554 -CB2 cannabinoid receptor agonist , was administered 25 min before morphine . Retches and vomits were counted at 5-min intervals for 30 min after morphine injection . RESULTS : Retching and vomiting responses increased with increasing morphine doses up to 1.0 mg/kg , above which the responses decreased . Previous administration of naloxone prevented morphine-induced retching and vomiting . WIN55,212-2 dose-dependently reduced retching and vomiting . The ED50 was 0.05 mg/kg for retches and 0.03 mg/kg for vomits . At 0.13 mg/kg , retching decreased by 76 % and vomiting by 92 % . AM251 , a P21554 receptor-selective antagonist , blocked the antiemetic actions of WIN55,212-2 , but AM630 , a CB2 receptor-selective antagonist , did not . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that WIN55,212-2 prevents opioid-induced vomiting and suggest that the antiemetic activity of WIN55,212-2 occurs at P21554 receptors . This is consistent with findings that P21554 receptors are the predominant cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system and that antiemetic effects of cannabinoids appear to be centrally mediated .
