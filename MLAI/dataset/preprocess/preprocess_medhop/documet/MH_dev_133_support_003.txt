Altered P25942 and P12830 expression -- putative role in oral lichen planus . BACKGROUND : Oral lichen planus ( OLP ) is characterized among other features by apoptosis of basal keratinocytes . To identify potential regulatory mechanisms associated with basal cell apoptosis in OLP , we investigated the expression of P25942 , P29965 ( P29965 ) , P16070 and epithelial ( E ) -cadherin . METHODS : Biopsies from 22 patients with OLP were investigated by immunohistochemistry for detection of P25942 , P29965 , P12830 , P16070 , Laminin-5 and Collagen IV , double-labelling for P25942 and CD3 , and in situ mRNA hybridization for P25942 and P29965 . RESULTS : In actively diseased areas of OLP lesions , basal keratinocytes did not express P25942 and were focally P12830 -negative , in contrast to non-diseased areas and normal oral mucosa . Demonstration of intraepithelial T cells expressing P25942 and P29965 , indicates a potential role in inflammatory cell responses involved in the disease process of OLP . CONCLUSION : T cells may orchestrate inflammatory cell responses in OLP via P25942 - P29965 interactions . As basal keratinocytes downregulate P25942 , they may escape P25942 - P29965 -induced apoptosis in OLP . On the other hand , loss of P12830 expression may contribute to epithelial basal cell destruction and T-cell migration into the epithelial compartment in OLP .
