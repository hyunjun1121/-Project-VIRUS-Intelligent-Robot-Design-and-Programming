An association analysis of circadian genes in anxiety disorders . BACKGROUND : The mammalian circadian system is responsible for controlling daily oscillations in physiology and behavior . Circadian genes contribute to the sleep-wake cycle and mood , and because patients with anxiety disorder often suffer from sleep disturbances , we hypothesized that variants in circadian-clock-related genes might predispose to human anxiety disorders as well . We tested this hypothesis with a genetic association analysis . METHODS : We analyzed 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 13 circadian-clock-related genes . The study sample consisted of 321 individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 653 matched healthy controls from a Finnish population-based cohort . RESULTS : Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two genes showed some evidence for association to social phobia : in Q8WYA1 rs2306073 ( p = .0099 ) and in P14416 rs7131056 ( p = .0084 ) . P10415 rs12454712 ( p = .0029 ) and P14416 rs4245146 ( p = .0010 ) showed evidence for association to generalized anxiety disorder , whereas rs2463107 ( p = .0064 ) in Q96IZ0 and rs4245146 ( p = .0029 ) in P14416 showed evidence for association to the pooled group of all anxiety disorders . Findings in P14416 became stronger when only anxiety disorder cases with comorbid alcohol use disorder were considered . CONCLUSIONS : Genes contributing to circadian rhythms might also play a role in the genetic predisposition to anxiety disorders . In addition , our study provides further support for the association of P14416 to comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorder .
