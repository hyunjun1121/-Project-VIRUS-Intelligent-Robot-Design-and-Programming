Alveolar hypoxia promotes murine lung tumor growth through a P35968 / P00533 -dependent mechanism . Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) are at an increased risk for the development of lung cancer , the mechanisms for which are incompletely understood . We hypothesized that the hypoxic pulmonary microenvironment present in P48444 would augment lung carcinogenesis . Mice were subjected to chemical carcinogenesis protocols and placed in either hypoxia or normoxia . Mice exposed to chronic hypoxia developed tumors with increased volume compared with normoxic controls . Both lungs and tumors from hypoxic mice showed a preferential stabilization of HIF-2α and increased expression of P15692 , P09038 , and their receptors as well as other survival , proliferation , and angiogenic signaling pathways regulated by HIF-2α . We showed that tumors arising in hypoxic animals have increased sensitivity to P35968 / P00533 inhibition , as chemoprevention with vandetanib showed markedly increased activity in hypoxic mice . These studies showed that lung tumors arising in a hypoxic microenvironment express increased growth , angiogenic , and survival signaling that could contribute to the increased lung cancer risk in P48444 . Furthermore , the differential sensitivity of tumors arising in hypoxia to P35968 / P00533 inhibition suggests that the altered signaling present in tumors arising in hypoxic lung might be therapeutically exploited in patients with underlying P48444 .
