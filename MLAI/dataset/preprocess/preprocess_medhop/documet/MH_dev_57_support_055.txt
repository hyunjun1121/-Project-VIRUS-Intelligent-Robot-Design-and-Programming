The regulation of sterol metabolism by cell interactions . Total and free cholesterol levels in P13671 glial cells are regulated by a cell interaction-dependent mechanism that operates independently of exogenous cholesterol and serum lipoproteins . This mechanism , which is activated by changes in culture density , coordinately regulates the activities of P04035 and acyl- DB01992 :cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ) . Both enzyme activities are low in sparse density cultures , rise as density increases from sparse to moderate , and decrease with further density increases . When culture density is abruptly elevated , both enzyme activities decay rapidly and with biphasic kinetics . Neither enzyme phosphorylation nor diffusible cytosolic factors appear to be directly involved in density suppression of P04035 . Studies with human fibroblasts that are defective in P01130 function demonstrate that density regulation does not require a functional P01130 . Extracellular matrix and soluble factors have also been ruled out as intercellular mediators . The specific growth rate of P13671 cultures changes with density in the same manner as sterol metabolism . The possibility that growth and sterol metabolism are regulated by a common cell interaction-dependent mechanism is discussed .
