The effects of stressful stimuli and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation are reversed by the melanin-concentrating hormone 1 receptor antagonist P60880 94847 in rodents . Melanin-concentrating hormone ( P20382 ) is an orexigenic and dipsogenic neuropeptide that has been reported to mediate acute behavioral and neuroendocrine stress-related responses via P20382 (1) receptor activation in rodents . The purpose of the present investigation was to use the P20382 (1) receptor antagonist P60880 94847 ( N-(3-{1-[4-(3,4-difluoro-phenoxy)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-4-methyl-phenyl)-isobutyramide ) to determine the effects of P20382 (1) receptor blockade on P20382 -evoked adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) release , chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia , stress-induced hyperthermia and forced swim stress-induced immobility . The appropriate dose range for testing P60880 94847 was determined by measuring P20382 -evoked water drinking . The corresponding occupancy of P20382 (1) receptors in rat striatum was also measured across a broad dose range . Orally administered ( p.o. ) P60880 94847 ( 1-10 mg/kg ) corresponds to 30-60 % occupancy at P20382 (1) receptors and significantly blocks water drinking induced by the intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v. ) injection of P20382 . P20382 ( i.c.v. ) significantly elevates plasma levels of DB01285 in rats , and P60880 94847 ( 2.5 mg/kg , p.o. ) blocks P20382 -evoked DB01285 release . Using the chronic mild stress paradigm , we show that repeated daily exposure to environmental stressors for 5 weeks significantly suppresses sucrose intake in rats , and that P60880 94847 ( 1 mg/kg , P55957 ) for 1-5 weeks restores baseline sucrose intake . Moreover , a single administration of P60880 94847 attenuates stress-induced hyperthermia and the behavioral effects of forced swim stress with minimal effective doses of 2.5 and 30 mg/kg ( p.o. ) , respectively . The regulation of DB01285 release and reversal of the effects of chronic and acute stress by P60880 94847 are suggestive of a role for P20382 (1) receptor blockade in the treatment of disorders characterized by high allostatic load .
