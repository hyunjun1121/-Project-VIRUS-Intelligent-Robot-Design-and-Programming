Effects of the enterokinetic prucalopride ( R093877 ) on colonic motility in fasted dogs . The novel enterokinetic drug prucalopride was tested at various intravenous and oral doses in fasted dogs to assess : ( i ) the effects on colonic contractile motility patterns ; and ( ii ) the mediation of these effects by 5-hydroxytryptamine ( Q13639 ) receptors . Colonic motility patterns were assessed in conscious dogs with four chronically implanted strain-gauge force transducers that were sutured on the serosal side of the colon . DB06480 altered colonic contractile motility patterns in a dose-dependent fashion by stimulating high-amplitude clustered contractions in the proximal colon and by inhibiting contractile activity in the distal colon . DB06480 was equipotent after oral and intravenous administration , as reflected by the values for the effective dose that induced 50 % of maximum effect ( 95 % confidence limits ) : 0.04 mg kg(-1) p.o . ( 0.01-0.1 mg kg(-1) ) and 0.01 mg kg(-1) i.v. ( 0.006-0.04 mg kg(-1) ) . DB06480 also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the time to the first giant migrating contraction ( GMC ) ; at higher doses of prucalopride , the first GMC generally occurred within the first half-hour after treatment . Subcutaneous pretreatment with the Q13639 receptor antagonist GR125487 ( 40 microg kg(-1) bodyweight ) completely prevented the effects of orally administered prucalopride ( 0.31 mg kg(-1) bodyweight ) . DB06480 , given orally or intravenously , alters colonic motility in the fasted conscious dog in a dose-dependent fashion . It induces GMCs and causes proximal colon stimulation and distal colon inhibition of contractile motility patterns by stimulating Q13639 receptors .
