Copy number analysis of 24 oncogenes : O15151 identified as a putative marker for low recurrence risk in non muscle invasive bladder cancer . Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) generally have a high risk of relapsing locally after primary tumor resection . The search for new predictive markers of local recurrence thus represents an important goal for the management of this disease . We studied the copy number variations ( CNVs ) of 24 oncogenes ( O15151 , P04198 , Q9UM73 , P16234 , P10721 , P35968 , P00374 , P00533 , MET , SMO , P11362 , MYC , P00519 , P07949 , P24385 , P30279 , P11802 , Q00987 , Q96GD4 , P04626 , P11388 , O14965 , AR and P15056 ) using multiplex ligation probe amplification technique to verify their role as predictive markers of recurrence . DB03843 -fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 43 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder ( TURB ) were used ; 23 patients had relapsed and 20 were disease-free after 5 years . Amplification frequencies were analyzed for all genes and O15151 was the only gene that showed significantly higher amplification in non recurrent patients than in recurrent ones ( 0.65 vs. 0.3 ; Fisher 's test p=0.023 ) . Recurrence-free survival analysis confirmed the predictive role of O15151 ( log-rank test p=0.041 ) . Our preliminary results indicate a putative role for the O15151 gene in predicting local recurrence of bladder cancer . Confirmation of this hypothesis is needed in a larger cohort of NMIBC patients .
