The specific Q14318 inhibitor N-(N',N'-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cycloheximide has potent neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties in brain ischemia . FK506 and FK506-derived inhibitors of the FK506-binding protein ( FKBP ) -type peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerases ( PPIase ) display potent neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties in various neurodegeneration models , showing the importance of neuroimmunophilins as targets for the treatment of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases . However , the PPIase activity targeted by active site-directed ligands remains unknown so far . Here we show that neurotrophic FKBP ligands , such as GPI1046 and N-[methyl(ethoxycarbonyl)]cycloheximide , inhibit the calmodulin/Ca(2+) ( P62158 /Ca(2+) ) -regulated Q14318 with up to 80-fold higher affinity than P62942 . In contrast , the non-neurotrophic rapamycin inhibits Q14318 . P62158 /Ca(2+) 500-fold less affine than other neuroimmunophillins . In the context of the high expression of Q14318 in neuroblastoma cells , these data suggest that Q14318 . P62158 /Ca(2+) inhibition can mediate neurotrophic properties of FKBP ligands . The Q14318 -specific cycloheximide derivative , N-(N',N'-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cycloheximide ( DM-CHX ) was synthesized and used in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia . Accordingly , DM-CHX caused neuronal protection as well as neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation at a dosage of 27.2 mug/kg . These effects were still dominant , if DM-CHX was applied 2-6 h post-insult . In parallel , sustained motor behavior deficits of diseased animals were improved by drug administration , revealing a potential therapeutic relevance . Thus , our results demonstrate that Q14318 inhibition by DM-CHX regulates neuronal cell death and proliferation , providing a promising strategy for the treatment of acute and/or chronic neurodegenerative diseases .
