Neuroendocrine response to clonidine and 8-OH-DPAT in rats following chronic administration of desipramine or sertraline . 1. Rats were administered either desipramine ( DB01151 ) or sertraline daily at doses 7.5 mg kg-1 or 10 mg kg-1 , i.p. , respectively and the effects on the functional state of hypothalamic neuroendocrine control mechanisms assessed by measurements of plasma hormones following acute drug challenge . The effects of treatment on gross behaviour and brain adrenoceptor density were also determined . 2 . Both DB01151 and sertraline caused significant reduction in activity measured as ambulation and rearing at 14 days of treatment . 3 . All animals were chronically cannulated after 14 days of treatment and tested for neuroendocrine response to acute i.v. clonidine ( 50 micrograms kg-1 ) or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT , 250 micrograms kg-1 ) after 21 or more days of treatment . 4 . Rats treated with DB01151 but not sertraline showed a virtually complete suppression of the growth hormone ( GH ) secretion elicited by clonidine in controls , while the secretion of corticosterone was augmented . 5 . Treatment with DB01151 but not sertraline led to a significantly greater 8-OH-DPAT-induced secretion of prolactin than in the control rats , while the plasma concentrations of corticosterone following 8-OH-DPAT were not influenced by either DB01151 or sertraline treatment . 6 . The density ( but not the affinity ) of cerebral cortical binding of [ 3H ] -dihydroalprenolol was significantly reduced by DB01151 treatment . 7 . These results show that DB01151 treatment blunted the sensitivity of post-synaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors , accompanied by complex interactions manifested as increased responsiveness of alpha 1-adrenoceptors and P08908 receptors . Sertraline had no significant neurendocrine effects at a dose which significantly reduced gross activity .
