DB00644 analogues reduce the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells but not endometriotic cells . AIMS : We investigated the potential of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) agonists and DB00644 antagonists to inhibit cell proliferation in endometriotic and endometrial stromal cells . METHODS : Twenty patients with ovarian endometriomas and 18 patients with uterine fibromas were recruited . Endometriotic and endometrial stromal cells were obtained from the ovarian chocolate cyst linings and the eutopic endometria of premenopausal women with uterine fibromas , respectively . RESULTS : DB00644 agonist or antagonist treatment attenuated tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α-induced cell proliferation in the endometrial stromal cells , whereas endometriotic stromal cells did not respond to treatment . The endometriotic stromal cells exhibited a decreased expression of the type I P30968 compared with the endometrial stromal cells . DB00644 agonists or antagonists did not repress P01375 -α-induced P10145 production in endometriotic stromal cells . CONCLUSION : DB00644 agonists and antagonists have similar effects in slowing the growth of endometrial stromal cells . Endometriotic stromal cells resist the antiproliferative effect of DB00644 agonists and antagonists .
