Endothelial histamine H1 receptor signaling reduces blood-brain barrier permeability and susceptibility to autoimmune encephalomyelitis . Disruption of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) underlies the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) and multiple sclerosis . Environmental factors , such as Bordetella pertussis , are thought to sensitize central endothelium to biogenic amines like histamine , thereby leading to increased BBB permeability . B. pertussis-induced histamine sensitization ( Bphs ) is a monogenic intermediate phenotype of EAE controlled by histamine H(1) receptor ( Hrh1/H(1)R ) . Here , we transgenically overexpressed H(1)R in endothelial cells of Hrh1-KO ( H(1)RKO ) mice to test the role of endothelial H(1)R directly in Bphs and EAE . Unexpectedly , transgenic H(1)RKO mice expressing endothelial H(1)R under control of the P04275 promoter ( H(1)RKO- P04275 ( P35367 ) Tg ) were Bphs-resistant . Moreover , H(1)RKO- P04275 ( P35367 ) Tg mice exhibited decreased BBB permeability and enhanced protection from EAE compared with H(1)RKO mice . Thus , contrary to prevailing assumptions , our results show that endothelial H(1)R expression reduces BBB permeability , suggesting that endothelial H(1)R signaling may be important in the maintenance of cerebrovascular integrity .
