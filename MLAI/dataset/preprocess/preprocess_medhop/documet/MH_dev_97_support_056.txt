Radiation-induced senescence in securin-deficient cancer cells promotes cell invasion involving the P05231 / P40763 and DB00102 / P09619 pathways . O95997 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in various tumours . We have previously shown that securin depletion promotes radiation-induced senescence and enhances radiosensitivity in human cancer cells . However , the underlying molecular mechanisms and the paracrine effects remain unknown . In this study , we showed that radiation induced senescence in securin-deficient human breast cancer cells involving the Q13315 /Chk2 and p38 pathways . Conditioned medium ( CM ) from senescent cells promoted the invasion and migration of non-irradiated cancer and endothelial cells . Cytokine assay analysis showed the up-regulation of various senescence-associated secretory phenotypes ( SASPs ) . The P05231 / P40763 signalling loop and platelet-derived growth factor-BB ( DB00102 ) /PDGF receptor ( P09619 ) pathway were important for CM-induced cell migration and invasion . Furthermore , CM promoted angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane though the induction of P05231 / P40763 - and DB00102 / P09619 -dependent endothelial cell invasion . Taken together , our results provide the molecular mechanisms for radiation-induced senescence in securin-deficient human breast cancer cells and for the SASP responses .
