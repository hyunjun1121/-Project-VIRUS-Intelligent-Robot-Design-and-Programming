DB01411 inhibits NF-kappaB activation and Q02817 gene expression in cultured human epithelial cells . DB01411 is a selective cysteinyl leukotriene ( 1 ) (cysLT(1)) receptor antagonist , and is now widely used in the treatment of asthma . The anti-asthmatic effect of pranlukast may be rendered not only by antileukotriene activity , but also by other pharmacological activity . This study was designed to investigate whether pranlukast had inhibitory effects on nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activation and mucin gene expression in cultured human epithelial cells . Luciferase assay was mainly used for analysis . Cultured epithelial cells were transfected with NF-kappaB luciferase vector , Q02817 or P98088 luciferase vectors . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) significantly increased NF-kappaB activation in NCI-H292 cells , which was inhibited by the pretreatment by pranlukast in a dose-dependent manner . Either LTD(4) or pranlukast alone did not increase NF-kappaB activation in NCI-H292 cells . DB01411 also inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . DB01411 also significantly inhibited LPS-induced Q02817 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis in NCI-H292 cells . DB01411 also inhibited LPS-induced Q02817 gene expression in HM3- Q02817 cells . However , pranlukast did not inhibit P98088 gene transcription activity induced by lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) in NCI-H292 cells . These results suggest that pranlukast may inhibit NF-kappaB activation and Q02817 gene transcription through pathways distinct from cysLT(1) receptor antagonism in cultured human epithelial cells .
