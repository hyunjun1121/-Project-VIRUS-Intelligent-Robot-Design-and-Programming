Study of retinoic acid effect upon retinoic acid receptors beta ( P10826 ) in P13671 cultured glioma cells . Using monoclonal antibodies against the P10276 and P10826 retinoic receptors , we demonstrated that these receptors were present together in P13671 glioma cells as two isoforms of 50 and 55 kDa . For P10826 , the 50 kDa isoform predominated ( 60 to 80 % of the total of the two isoforms ) . After a treatment for 48 h with retinoic acid 10 microM , the 55 kDa form was enhanced , while no effect was observed either on P10276 isoforms from P13671 cells and on both P10276 and P10826 forms from neuroblastoma SKN SH SY5Y used as a control . Using purified neuronal and glial rat brain nuclei , we showed that the 55 kDa isoform from P10826 predominated in glial cells . These results suggest that retinoic acid treatment of P13671 cells led to a partial differentiation , the enhancement of the heavy form of P10826 being a marker of this phenomenon .
