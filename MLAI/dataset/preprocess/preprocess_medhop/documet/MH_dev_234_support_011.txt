The effects of GM- P04141 , steel factor and MIP-1alpha on the expression and activation of Cdc25A phosphatase in Mo7e cells . Active cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) are required for progression through the P55008 phase of the cell cycle and entry into S phase . Activity of P55008 CDKs is controlled by mechanisms including phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 residues . Removal of inhibitory phosphates on these amino acid residues is required for P55008 CDK activation , and is mediated by the Cdc25A phosphatase . Regulation of active Cdc25A phosphatase levels may be important for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells , effects assessed in the human growth-factor-dependent cell line Mo7e . Constitutive Cdc25A protein levels were enhanced with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) plus steel factor ( SF ) . Cdc25A is thought to exert its activity in the nucleus , and nuclear protein levels of Cdc25A were also enhanced with GM- P04141 and SF . GM- P04141 plus SF promote synergistic growth of Mo7e cells . Pretreatment with macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP-1alpha ) inhibited GM- P04141 - plus SF-induced growth and upregulation of Cdc25A protein levels . Stimulation with GM- P04141 and SF also rapidly increased Cdc25A phosphatase activity , an effect suppressed by MIP-1alpha . A concomitant inhibition of increased P11802 kinase activity correlated with increased phosphotyrosine levels on P11802 when cells were pretreated with MIP-1alpha prior to GM- P04141 and SF . These data suggest that Cdc25A expression and activity are regulated during proliferation of Mo7e cells .
