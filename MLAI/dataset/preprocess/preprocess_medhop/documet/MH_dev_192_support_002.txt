Multi-parametric spinal cord Q9BWK5 as potential progression marker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate multimodal Q9BWK5 of the spinal cord in predicting disease progression and one-year clinical status in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS : After a first Q9BWK5 ( Q9BV20 ) , 29 P35858 patients were clinically followed during 12 months ; 14/29 patients underwent a second Q9BWK5 ( MRI2 ) at 11±3 months . Cross-sectional area ( Q13216 ) that has been shown to be a marker of lower motor neuron degeneration was measured in cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord from P24752 -weighted images . Fractional anisotropy ( FA ) , axial/radial/mean diffusivities ( λ⊥ , λ// , MD ) and magnetization transfer ratio ( Q99707 ) were measured within the lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical region . Imaging metrics were compared with clinical scales : Revised P35858 Functional Rating Scale ( ALSFRS-R ) and manual muscle testing ( MMT ) score . RESULTS : At Q9BV20 , Q13216 correlated significantly ( P < 0.05 ) with MMT and arm ALSFRS-R scores . FA correlated significantly with leg ALFSRS-R scores . One year after Q9BV20 , Q13216 predicted ( P < 0.01 ) arm ALSFSR-R subscore and FA predicted ( P < 0.01 ) leg ALSFRS-R subscore . From Q9BV20 to MRI2 , significant changes ( P < 0.01 ) were detected for Q13216 and Q99707 . Q13216 rate of change ( i.e. atrophy ) highly correlated ( P < 0.01 ) with arm ALSFRS-R and arm MMT subscores rate of change . CONCLUSION : Atrophy and DTI metrics predicted P35858 disease progression . Cord atrophy was a better biomarker of disease progression than diffusion and Q99707 . Our study suggests that multimodal Q9BWK5 could provide surrogate markers of P35858 that may help monitoring the effect of disease-modifying drugs .
