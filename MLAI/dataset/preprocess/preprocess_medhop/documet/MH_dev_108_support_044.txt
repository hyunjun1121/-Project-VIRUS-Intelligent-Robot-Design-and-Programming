Golimumab , the newest P01375 -α blocker , comes of age . Golimumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) is one of the newest biologics that has become available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis . Following the initial randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials , which demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the drug in the context of a limited patient sample and a relatively short time frame , DB06674 has been the focus of continuous investigation through the extensions of the above-mentioned trials , new clinical trials and registries of biologic drug use in daily clinical practice . The review of this data and their inclusion in meta-analyses and indirect comparisons across P01375 -α blockers suggest that DB06674 possesses similar properties regarding efficacy and safety as the older monoclonal anti- P01375 -α antibodies . The novelty of DB06674 is perhaps its dosing regimen , i.e. subcutaneous self-administration once monthly , which allows for the least disturbance in the life of patients .
