Enhancement of auranofin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cells by selenocystine , a synergistic inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase . P10599 system plays an important role in regulation of intracellular redox balance and various signaling pathways . P30044 ( TrxR ) is overexpressed in many cancer cells and has been identified as a potential target of anticancer drugs . DB00995 ( AF ) is potent TrxR inhibitor with novel in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities . Selenocystine ( SeC ) is a nutritionally available selenoamino acid with selective anticancer effects through induction of apoptosis . In the present study , we demonstrated the synergistic effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms of SeC in combination with AF on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . The results showed that SeC and AF synergistically inhibited the cancer cell growth through induction of ROS-dependent apoptosis with the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction . DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation and down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT and P29323 also contributed to cell apoptosis . Moreover , we demonstrated the important role of TrxR activity in the synergistic action of SeC and AF . Taken together , our results suggest the strategy to use SeC and AF in combination could be a highly efficient way to achieve anticancer synergism by targeting TrxR .
