P10275 in human placental villi . In studies with a synthetic androgen , R 1881 , an androgen-binding component was found in the cytosol of human placental villi . Kinetic analysis indicated that the Kd value of this component was 1.4 nM at 0-4 degrees C and that binding of R 1881 amounted to 277 +/- 73 fmol/mg protein. glycerol density gradient ultracentrifugation showed a peak of binding activity in the 8S region in a medium of low ionic strength , but in the 4.5S region in a medium containing 9.5 M DB00761 . The R 1881-binding component was inactivated by mild heat- or trypsin-treatment , but not by treatment with DNase or RNase . Most of the R 1881-binding activity was sedimented at 20 to 40 % saturation of ammonium sulfate . These findings indicate that the R 1881-binding component in human placental cytosol is quite similar in its characteristics to androgen receptors , which are present in various androgen-responsive organs . DB00624 was a more potent competitor of R 1881-binding than DB02901 or cyproterone acetate . Scatchard plots indicated that the binding site of testosterone was identical with that of R 1881 . These findings suggest that the androgen receptor in placental cytosol is specific for testosterone . The Kd value for testosterone was calculated to be 3.2 nM .
