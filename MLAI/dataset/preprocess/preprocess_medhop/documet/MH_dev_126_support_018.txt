Potential role for epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in combined-modality therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer . There has been a surge of interest in the translation of discoveries in molecular biology into clinically relevant therapies in the field of hematology/oncology . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) has been a molecular target of significant interest and investigation , and preclinical and clinical studies support a role for targeted therapy in a variety of cancers , including non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) via compounds that specifically inhibit P00533 . ZD1839 , IMC-C225 , and DB00530 are the most clinically developed of these compounds . Interestingly , preclinical studies have demonstrated that P00533 inhibitors may have radiation-sensitizing properties , as well as increased cytotoxic activity in combination with chemotherapeutic agents , suggesting a potential role for P00533 inhibitors as an adjunct to the current combined-modality approach for therapy of Stage III NSCLC . Therefore , clinical trials have been proposed and initiated to address the issue of determining the impact of the addition of P00533 inhibitors to the standard combined-modality regimen ( chemotherapy/radiation therapy +/- surgery ) for Stage III NSCLC . This article reviews preclinical and clinical data supporting the role for P00533 inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy/radiation therapy for locally advanced NSCLC . Also , it will provide an overview of ongoing and proposed clinical studies investigating the potential role for P00533 inhibitors in Stage III NSCLC .
