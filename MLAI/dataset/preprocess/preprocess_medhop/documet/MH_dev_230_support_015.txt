Inhibition of mutant P15056 splice variant signaling by next-generation , selective RAF inhibitors . DB08881 and dabrafenib block MEK- P27361 /2 signaling and cause tumor regression in the majority of advanced-stage P15056 (V600E) melanoma patients ; however , acquired resistance and paradoxical signaling have driven efforts for more potent and selective RAF inhibitors . Next-generation RAF inhibitors , such as PLX7904 ( PB04 ) , effectively inhibit RAF signaling in P15056 (V600E) melanoma cells without paradoxical effects in wild-type cells . Furthermore , PLX7904 blocks the growth of vemurafenib-resistant P15056 (V600E) cells that express mutant P01111 . Acquired resistance to vemurafenib and dabrafenib is also frequently driven by expression of mutation P15056 splice variants ; thus , we tested the effects of PLX7904 and its clinical analog , PLX8394 ( PB03 ) , in P15056 (V600E) splice variant-mediated vemurafenib-resistant cells . We show that paradox-breaker RAF inhibitors potently block MEK- P27361 /2 signaling , P55008 /S cell cycle events , survival and growth of vemurafenib/PLX4720-resistant cells harboring distinct P15056 (V600E) splice variants . These data support the further investigation of paradox-breaker RAF inhibitors as a second-line treatment option for patients failing on vemurafenib or dabrafenib .
