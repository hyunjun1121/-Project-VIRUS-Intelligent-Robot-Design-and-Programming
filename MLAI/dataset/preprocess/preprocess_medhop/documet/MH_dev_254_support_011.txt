Use of trifluoroperazine isolates a [(3)H] DB08954 binding site in rat brain membranes with the pharmacology of the voltage-independent ifenprodil site on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors containing Q13224 subunits . The use of trifluoroperazine in a well washed rat brain membrane preparation revealed [(3)H]ifenprodil binding to a single high affinity state with the pharmacology of N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptors containing Q13224 subunits . Inhibition of [(3)H]ifenprodil binding in the presence of trifluoroperazine by 10 NR1a/ Q13224 selective agents was highly correlated with their inhibition at rat NR1a/ Q13224 receptors expressed in Xenopus ooctyes and [(3)H] DB01520 binding to rat brain Q13224 subunit containing DB01221 receptors but not with their inhibition of [(3)H]DTG binding . Allosteric interactions with polyamines , Mg(2+) , Zn(2+) , glutamate , glycine , and their antagonists were consistent with DB01221 receptors with Q13224 subtype pharmacology . The rank order of polyamine inhibition was spermine > spermidine > 1,5-(diethylamino)piperidine > arcaine > agmatine > putrescine . Both spermidine and MgCl(2) shifted the inhibition curve of ifenprodil to the right in a parallel manner , but Mg(2+) did not appear to be additive to spermidine . Glutamate increased and glycine decreased the binding . Conversely , CPP decreased the binding , and MDL 105,519 increased the binding in an agonist reversible manner . The increase with MDL 105,519 and glutamate appeared to be additive as did the decrease with glycine and CPP . Changes in the buffer pH between 6.5 and 8.0 did not affect the affinity of Q13224 agents . DB09202 but not clonidine inhibited the binding . MK-801 and agents from various other pharmacological classes did not significantly inhibit [(3)H]ifenprodil binding . [(3)H] DB08954 binding in the presence of trifluoroperazine appears to be selective for the voltage-independent ifenprodil site on DB01221 receptors containing the Q13224 subunit .
