Exercise enhances insulin and leptin signaling in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus during dexamethasone-induced stress in diabetic rats . Exercise and dexamethasone ( DEX ) are known to have opposite effects on peripheral insulin resistance . However , their effects and mechanism on brain glucose metabolism have been poorly defined . We investigated the modulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis and insulin/leptin signaling associated with glucose utilization in the brains of 90 % pancreatectomized diabetic rats , which had been administered two dosages of DEX and exercised for 8 weeks . The data revealed that the administration of a high dose ( 0.1 mg/kg body weight/day ) of DEX ( HDEX ) attenuated insulin signaling in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus , whereas exercise potentiated their insulin signaling along with induction of Q9Y4H2 expression . In parallel with the modulated signaling , glucose utilization , such as glycogen storage and glycogen synthase activity , was suppressed by DEX in the cortex and hypothalamus , while exercise offset the DEX effects . Despite a decrease in epididymal fat mass , HDEX increased serum leptin levels , possibly due to an activated Q9Y251 axis , while exercise suppressed the increment . However , DEX reduced leptin-induced P40763 phosphorylation in the cortex and hypothalamus , and it increased AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) phosphorylation only in the hypothalamus . Exercise reversed the phosphorylation of P40763 and AMPK which had been modulated by DEX . In conclusion , exercise improves insulin and leptin signaling in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus of diabetic rats exacerbated with HDEX , contributing to the regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis .
