DB00072 emtansine in the treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer in Japanese patients . Anti- P04626 agents , such as trastuzumab , lapatinib , trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , and pertuzumab , are standard agents in the treatment of breast cancer overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) . DB00072 is the first approved P04626 -targeted agent . Subsequent developments include agents with different mechanisms . In this paper , we review the results of clinical trials of DB05773 , a new anti- P04626 agent , with a focus on Japanese patients with breast cancer . On the basis of results from a Phase I study ( JO22591 ) , the maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for both Japanese and western patients . In a Phase II study ( JO22997 ) , the overall response rate was 38.4 % ( 90 % confidence interval 28.8-48.6 ) . DB05773 was well tolerated in Japanese patients ; however , the incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was higher than that observed in earlier western studies , but was not associated with clinically important symptoms . Pharmacokinetic parameters for DB05773 and its metabolites were consistent with those reported previously from a Phase I or II study in non-Japanese patients , and the data obtained showed no suggestion of ethnic differences . Several Phase III studies of DB05773 are ongoing throughout the world , including in Japanese patients with breast cancer .
