Fluorescence energy transfer analysis of calmodulin-peptide complexes . The interactions between calmodulin and the tryptophan residues of synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin binding domains of skeletal muscle myosin light-chain kinase and the plasma membrane calcium pump were examined . The single tryptophan residue contained in each peptide became relatively immobilized and inaccessible to iodide ion upon binding to calmodulin , indicating that the indole side chain was inserted into a hydrophobic cleft in the surface of calmodulin . Fluorescence energy transfer from peptidyl tryptophan residues to an AEDANS moiety attached to cysteine-26 of spinach calmodulin was measured . Included in these analyses was a tryptophan-containing peptide analog of the calmodulin binding domain of neuromodulin . These data indicated that the indole ring of each peptide inserted 32-35 A away from cysteine-26 and may therefore interact with the carboxyl-terminal lobe of P62158 in its " bent " conformation [ Persechini & Kretsinger ( 1988a ) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 12 ( Suppl 5 ) , S1- P28222 ; Ikura et al. ( 1992 ) Science 256 , 632-638 ; Vorherr et al. ( 1992 ) Eur. J. Biochem. 204 , 931-937 ] . The interchange of tryptophan-3 and phenylalanine-21 of the calcium pump peptide increased the efficiency of energy transfer to the AEDANS-moiety approximately 12-fold , reducing the calculated distance to 20 A . These data suggest that phenylalanine-21 of the calcium pump peptide interacts with the hydrophobic cleft in the amino-terminal lobe of P62158 .
