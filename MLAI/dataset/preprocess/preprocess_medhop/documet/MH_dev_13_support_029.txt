Serious obstetric complications interact with hypoxia-regulated/vascular-expression genes to influence schizophrenia risk . The etiology of schizophrenia is thought to include both epistasis and gene-environment interactions . We sought to test whether a set of schizophrenia candidate genes regulated by hypoxia or involved in vascular function in the brain ( P31749 , P23560 , O75052 , P36544 , P21964 , Q96EV8 , Q99259 , Q14832 , Q99466 , Q02297 , O43272 , P49798 , P01375 ) interacted with serious obstetric complications to influence risk for schizophrenia . A family-based study of transmission disequilibrium was conducted in 116 trios . Twenty-nine probands had at least one serious obstetric complication ( OC ) using the McNeil-Sjostrom Scale , and many of the OCs reported were associated with the potential for fetal hypoxia . Analyses were conducted using conditional logistic regression and a likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) between nested models was performed to assess significance . Of the 13 genes examined , four ( P31749 ( three SNPs ) , P23560 ( two SNPs ) , Q96EV8 ( one SNP ) and Q14832 ( one SNP ) ) showed significant evidence for gene-by-environment interaction ( LRT P-values ranged from 0.011 to 0.037 ) . Although our sample size was modest and the power to detect interactions was limited , we report significant evidence for genes involved in neurovascular function or regulated by hypoxia interacting with the presence of serious obstetric complications to increase risk for schizophrenia .
