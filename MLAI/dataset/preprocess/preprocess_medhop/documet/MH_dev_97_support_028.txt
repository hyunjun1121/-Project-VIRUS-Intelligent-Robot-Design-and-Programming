P10828 is essential for development of auditory function . Congenital thyroid disorders are often associated with profound deafness , indicating a requirement for thyroid hormone ( DB00279 ) and its receptors in the development of hearing . Two DB00279 receptor genes , Tr alpha and Tr beta are differentially expressed , although in overlapping patterns , during development . Thus , the extent to which they mediate unique or redundant functions is unclear . We demonstrate that Tr beta-deficient ( Thrb-/- ) mice exhibit a permanent deficit in auditory function across a wide range of frequencies , although they show no other overt neurological defects . The auditory-evoked brainstem response ( Q12979 ) in Thrb-/- mice , although greatly diminished , displayed normal waveforms , which suggested that the primary defect resides in the cochlea . Although hypothyroidism causes cochlear malformation , there was no evidence of this in Thrb-/- mice . These findings suggest that Tr beta controls the maturation of auditory function but not morphogenesis of the cochlea . Thrb-/- mice provide a model for the human endocrine disorder of resistance to thyroid hormone ( RTH ) , which is typically associated with dominant mutations in Tr beta . However , deafness is generally absent in RTH , indicating that dominant and recessive mutations in Tr beta have different consequences on the auditory system . Our results identify Tr beta as an essential transcription factor for auditory development and indicate that distinct Tr genes serve certain unique functions .
