P14174 deficiency in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) remains poorly understood . Cellular senescence and apoptosis contribute to the development of P48444 ; however , crucial regulators of these underlying mechanisms remain unknown . P14174 ( MIF ) is a pleiotropic cytokine that antagonizes both apoptosis and premature senescence and may be important in the pathogenesis of P48444 . This study examines the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of P48444 . Mice deficient in MIF ( Mif(-/-) ) or the MIF receptor P04233 ( Cd74(-/-) ) and wild-type ( WT ) controls were aged for 6 mo . Both Mif(-/-) and Cd74(-/-) mice developed spontaneous emphysema by 6 mo of age compared with WT mice as measured by lung volume and chord length . This was associated with activation of the senescent pathway markers p53/21 and p16 . Following exposure to cigarette smoke , Mif(-/-) mice were more susceptible to the development of P48444 and apoptosis compared with WT mice . MIF plasma concentrations were measured in a cohort of 224 human participants . Within a subgroup of older current and former smokers ( n = 72 ) , MIF concentrations were significantly lower in those with P48444 [ 8.8 , 95 % CI ( 6.7-11.0 ) ] compared with those who did not exhibit P48444 [ 12.7 ng/ml , 95 % CI ( 10.6-14.8 ) ] . Our results suggest that both MIF and the MIF receptor P04233 are required for maintenance of normal alveolar structure in mice and that decreases in MIF are associated with P48444 in human subjects .
