anti- P01375 agents as therapeutic choice in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases : focus on adalimumab . The complex pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases ( IMIDs ) has been extensively investigated and dysregulation of cytokines , such as tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) has been shown to play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of various IMIDs , such as rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . The subsequent development of biological agents capable of blocking P01375 has led to important advances in the pharmacotherapy of such diseases and confirmed the concept of a common pathophysiology among IMIDs with P01375 having a predominant role . Five P01375 inhibitors have currently been approved for treatment of one or more IMIDs ; these include infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , DB06674 and certolizumab pegol . Given the similarities in the pathogenic background of IMIDs , one could expect that anti- P01375 agents be similarly effective and with comparable tolerability profiles ; however , this may not be the case . Structural and pharmacological differences among the anti- P01375 drugs are likely to result in differences in efficacy and tolerability among the agents in the different IMIDs , together with differences in potency , therapeutic dose ranges , dosing regimens , administration routes , and propensity for immunogenicity . Among the five P01375 inhibitors approved for treatment of IMIDs , adalimumab has the widest range of indications . Data from controlled clinical trials of adalimumab , showing its excellent efficacy and tolerability in a wide range of indications , are supported by real-world long-term data from observational studies , which confirm the value of adalimumab as a suitable choice in the management of IMIDs .
