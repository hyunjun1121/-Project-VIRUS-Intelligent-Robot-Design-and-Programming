DB08904 for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis . DB08904 ( CZP ) is a P01375 -α inhibitor approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in 38 countries , including many European countries and the USA . It is a pegylated humanized anti- P01375 -α antigen-binding fragment , administered subcutaneously . As other P01375 -α antibodies , CZP binds to and neutralizes both soluble and membrane P01375 -α . In contrast to whole antibodies and etanercept , CZP does not activate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity , as it does not have an Fc piece . CZP showed efficacy in improving skin scores and patient reported outcomes in a Phase II study of 176 adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis . In a Phase III study of CZP in 409 psoriatic arthritis patients , CZP treatment resulted in improvements in peripheral arthritis , as well as dactylitis , enthesitis , nail disease and quality of life . The safety profile of CZP appears to be similar to that of other P01375 -α inhibitor .
