Clinical and comparative utility of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer . The first targeted agents approved for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treatment , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) gefitinib and erlotinib , have an impressive activity in the presence of activating mutations of the P00533 gene . However , all patients develop acquired resistance principally through secondary mutations ( T790M ) , P04626 amplification , MET amplification , and other molecular aberrations . An attempt to overcome P00533 TKI resistance has been through the development of irreversible blockers . DB08916 is an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of all members of the HER family . The pharmacologic properties of afatinib ( formation of covalent bonds , inhibition of other family members , and in vitro and in vivo activity on T790M mutation positive tumors ) made this drug particularly appealing to study in clinic . Therefore , an intense program of clinical research ( LUX-Lung program ) was started and clinical results have shown very encouraging activity profiles in patients harboring P00533 activating mutations and in those with acquired resistance to reversible TKIs .
