Variants of dopamine and serotonin candidate genes as predictors of response to risperidone treatment in first-episode schizophrenia . AIMS : Abnormalities in dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission systems are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics . We conducted a pharmacogenetic study to evaluate whether variants in dopamine-related genes ( P21728 - P21918 , P31749 and GSK3beta ) and serotonin receptor genes ( P08908 , P28222 , P28221 , P28223 , P28335 , P50406 and P34969 ) can be used to predict the efficacy of risperidone treatment for schizophrenia . MATERIALS & METHODS : A total of 120 first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients were treated with risperidone monotherapy for 8 weeks and clinical symptoms were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale . RESULTS : Among the 30 variants that we examined , two SNPs in P14416 ( -241A > G [ rs1799978 ] and TaqIA [ rs1800497 ] ) and two SNPs in P31749 ( P31749 -SNP1 [ rs3803300 ] and P31749 -SNP5 [ rs2494732 ] ) were significant predictors of treatment response to risperidone . CONCLUSION : These data suggest that the SNPs in P14416 and P31749 may influence the treatment response to risperidone in schizophrenia patients .
