The P36888 tyrosine kinase receptor inhibits neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and collaborates with P01138 to promote neuronal survival . The P36888 receptor tyrosine kinase ( P36888 ) was originally identified on hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) and its ligand ( FL ) induces P19526 proliferation . As stem cells originating from various tissues are more similar than once thought , the goal of this study was to determine whether neural stem cells express P36888 and proliferate in response to FL . In fact , a subset of neural stem/progenitor cells does express P36888 , but contrary to our expectations , FL inhibited P01133 and P09038 stimulated proliferation . Since P36888 is expressed weakly by proliferative neuroepithelia but strongly by subsets of neurons in the CNS and PNS , we tested its ability to support neuronal survival . FL synergized with P01138 to promote the survival of cultured Q86YR7 neurons , although it lacked any neurotrophic activity alone . We conclude that FL serves as an adjunct trophic factor in the nervous system , which differs from its role in the hematopoietic system .
