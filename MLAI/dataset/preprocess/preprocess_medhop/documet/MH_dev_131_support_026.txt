P62937 is required for Q9C035 {alpha}-mediated resistance to HIV-1 in Old World monkey cells . The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A ( CypA ) embraces an exposed , proline-rich loop on HIV-1 capsid ( CA ) and renders reverse transcription complexes resistant to an antiviral activity in human cells . A CypA fusion with Q9C035 that is unique to New World owl monkeys also targets HIV-1 CA , but this interaction potently inhibits infection . A similar block to HIV-1 infection in Old World monkeys is attributable to the alpha isoform of the Q9C035 orthologue in these species . To determine whether HIV-1 restriction by Old World monkey TRIM5alpha is modulated by the CA-CypA interaction , RNA interference was used to disrupt CypA in cells from African green monkeys and rhesus macaques . HIV-1 infectivity increased in response to CypA knock-down to the same extent that it increased in response to Q9C035 knock-down . CypA knock-down eliminated the HIV-1 stimulatory effect of cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) , a competitive inhibitor of the CypA-CA interaction , or of CA mutants that block binding to CypA but caused no change in titer of retroviruses that do n't interact with CypA . Simultaneous knock-down of both CypA and Q9C035 caused minimal additional increase in titer , suggesting that CypA inhibits HIV-1 replication in these cells because it is required for CA recognition by TRIM5alpha . Finally , DB00091 increased HIV-1 titer in otherwise nonrestrictive feline cells but only after these cells were transduced with Old World monkey TRIM5alpha . Thus , CypA is required for HIV-1 restriction by Old World monkey orthologues of TRIM5alpha .
