Linear and conformational B cell epitope prediction of the HER 2 O95905 -subdomain III by in silico methods . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in all processes of cell development . Their overexpression is related to many cancers , including examples in the breast , ovaries and stomach . Anticancer therapies targeting the P04626 receptor have shown promise , and monoclonal antibodies against subdomains II and IV of the P04626 extra-cellular domain ( O95905 ) , DB06366 and Herceptin , are currently used in treatments for some types of breast cancers . Since anti P04626 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes have different biological effects on cancer cells ; in this research linear and conformational B cell epitopes of P04626 O95905 , subdomain III , were identified by bioinformatics analyses using a combination of linear B cell epitope prediction web servers such as ABCpred , BCPREDs , Bepired , Bcepred and Elliprro . Then , Discotope , CBtope and SUPERFICIAL software tools were employed for conformational B cell epitope prediction . In contrast to previously reported epitopes of P04626 O95905 we predicted conformational B cell epitopes P1C : 378-393 ( PESFDGDPASNTAPLQ ) and P2C : 500-510 ( PEDECVGEGLA ) by the integrated strategy and and P4 : PESFDGD-X-TAPLQ ; Q15084 : PESFDGDP X TAPLQ ; P6 : ESFDGDP X NTAPLQP ; Q0GE19 : PESFDGDP-X-NTAPLQ ; P8 : ESFDG-XX-TAPLQPEQL and P9 : ESFDGDP- X-NTAPLQP by SUPERFICIAL software . These epitopes could be further used as peptide antigens to actively immune mice for development of new monoclonal antibodies and peptide cancer vaccines that target different epitopes or structural domains of P04626 O95905 .
