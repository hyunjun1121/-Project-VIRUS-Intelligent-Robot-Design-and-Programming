Isoenzyme-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors : a whole cell assay system using the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL and the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 . NSAIDs inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid into DB03866 and Prostaglandin H2 which is catalyzed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) . Two genetically distinct isoforms have been discovered , P23219 and P35354 . While P23219 is thought to account for homeostatic amounts of eicosanoids , P35354 is induced during inflammation leading to pathologic amounts of eicosanoids . Since NSAIDs inhibit both P36551 isoforms , antiinflammatory drug research has refocused to discovering P35354 inhibitors that do not inhibit P23219 . For this purpose , we have developed a whole cell assay system using the human erythroleukemic cell line HEL as a source for P23219 and the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as a source for P35354 . Mono Mac 6 cells express high amounts of P35354 upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in the absence of any detectable P23219 protein . On the other hand , we find HEL cells to naturally express P23219 protein , but not P35354 . Testing of a panel of NSAIDs as well as some P35354 specific inhibitors showed that this assay system is suitable for identifying compounds that selectively inhibit either P23219 or P35354 . This test system offers the advantage of assessing P23219 and P35354 inhibitors within the human species , within a similar test set-up , and circumvents the need for tedious purification of either platelets or peripheral blood monocytes .
