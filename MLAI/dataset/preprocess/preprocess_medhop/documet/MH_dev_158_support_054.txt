P62937 , the major intracellular receptor for the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A , maps to chromosome 7p11.2-p13 : four pseudogenes map to chromosomes 3 , 10 , 14 , and 18 . P62937 ( CyP-A ) , the major intracellular receptor for the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) , is a member of the immunophilin class of proteins , which all possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and , therefore , are believed to be involved in protein folding and/or intracellular protein transport . The CyP-A protein is encoded by a single gene ; in addition , 15 pseudogenes have been identified . Recently , specific binding of CyP-A to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) gag protein has been reported . Interestingly , this interaction can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant DB00091 and also by nonimmunosuppressive , CyP-A-binding DB00091 derivatives , which were also shown to exhibit potent anti-HIV-1 activity . Results thus indicate that CyP-A may have an essential function in HIV-1 replication . Using a panel of somatic rodent-human cell hybrids and PCR technology , we localized the coding cyclophilin A gene ( P62937 ) on chromosome 7 and four pseudogenes ( PPIP2 , PPIP3 , PPIP4 , and PPIP6 ) on chromosomes 14 , 10 , 18 , and 3 , respectively . Using chromosome 7 and chromosome 10 deletion hybrid panels , we were able to localize further the coding gene to the region 7p11.2-p13 , as confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis , and one pseudogene ( PPIP3 ) to the region 10q11.2-q23 . This is the first report on the regional mapping of members of the CyP-A gene family .
