Treatment of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . Our previous studies have shown vascular dysfunction in small coronary and mesenteric arteries in Zucker obese rats , a model of the metabolic syndrome , and Zucker Diabetic Fatty ( ZDF ) rats , a model of type 2 diabetes . Because of their lipid lowering action and antioxidant activity , we predicted that treatment with DB01098 , an P04035 inhibitor ( statin ) or Enalapril , an angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor would improve vascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes . METHODS : 20-week-old Zucker obese and 16-week-old ZDF rats were treated with DB01098 ( 25 mg/kg/day ) or Enalapril ( 20 mg/kg/day ) for 12 weeks . We examined metabolic parameters , indices of oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in ventricular and mesenteric small arteries ( 75-175 microm intraluminal diameter ) from lean , Zucker obese and ZDF rats ( untreated and treated ) . RESULTS : Endothelial dependent responses were attenuated in coronary vessels from Zucker obese and ZDF rats compared to responses from lean rats . Both drugs improved metabolic parameters , oxidative stress , and vascular dysfunction in Zucker obese rats , however , only partial improvement was observed in ZDF rats , suggesting more aggressive treatment is needed when hyperglycemia is involved . CONCLUSION : Vascular dysfunction is improved when Zucker obese and , to a lesser degree , when ZDF rats were treated with DB01098 or Enalapril .
