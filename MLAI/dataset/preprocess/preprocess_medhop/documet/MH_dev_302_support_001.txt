Menstrual cycle-dependent febrile episode mediated by sequence-specific repression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 on the transcription of the human serotonin receptor 1A gene . The serotonin receptor 1A ( encoded by the P08908 gene ) plays a critical role in serotonergic transmission and was linked with many human diseases . A 33-year-old woman with rare menstrual cycle-dependent fever showed abnormal estrogen profile and responded well to the P08908 agonist buspirone , suggesting that her fevers were allied to estrogen-related P08908 deficiency . We identified an adenine deletion 480-bases upstream of the translation start site ( i.e. , -480delA ) of P08908 in this patient . To determine the underlying mechanism of -480delA-mediated P08908 deficiency , we first showed that P08908 -480 region can be bound by multiple nuclear protein(s) . We then identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( P09874 ) as one of the proteins that binds to P08908 -480 region . Using P09874 overexpression and knockdown , our data demonstrated that P09874 represses P08908 transcription . Furthermore , P08908 -480delA promoter possesses increased interaction with P09874 and caused an additional reduction in transcription . Finally , 17Î²-estradiol administration further reduced transcription associated with the mutant promoter . Altogether , these data suggest that estrogen-induced hyperactivity of P08908 mutant promoter causes the reduction of P08908 mRNA and leads to the disruption of P08908 -mediate hypothermic regulation . This is the first report of P08908 mutation underlying menstrual cycle-dependent febrile episodes , and implies that similar " febrile episode " cases may also result from the dysfunction of serotonin transmission .
