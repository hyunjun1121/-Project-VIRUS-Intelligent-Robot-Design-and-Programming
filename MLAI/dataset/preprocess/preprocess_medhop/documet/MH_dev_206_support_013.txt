P03372 1 ( P03372 ; ERα ) , not Q92731 ( ERβ ) , modulates estrogen-induced sex reversal in the American alligator , a species with temperature-dependent sex determination . All crocodilians and many turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination where the temperature of the incubated egg , during a thermo-sensitive period ( P07996 ) , determines the sex of the offspring . DB00286 play a critical role in sex determination in crocodilians and turtles , as it likely does in most nonmammalian vertebrates . Indeed , administration of estrogens during the P07996 induces male to female sex reversal at a male-producing temperature ( MPT ) . However , it is not clear how estrogens override the influence of temperature during sex determination in these species . Most vertebrates have 2 forms of nuclear estrogen receptor ( P03372 ) : P03372 ( ERα ) and Q92731 ( ERβ ) . However , there is no direct evidence concerning which P03372 is involved in sex determination , because a specific agonist or antagonist for each P03372 has not been tested in nonmammalian species . We identified specific pharmaceutical agonists for each P03372 using an in vitro transactivation assay employing American alligator P03372 and Q92731 ; these were 4,4',4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol ( PPT ) and 7-bromo-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3-benzoxazol-5-ol ( WAY 200070 ) , respectively . Alligator eggs were exposed to PPT or WAY 200070 at a MPT just before the P07996 , and their sex was examined at the last stage of embryonic development . Estradiol-17β and PPT , but not WAY 200070 , induced sex reversal at a MPT . PPT-exposed embryos exposed to the highest dose ( 5.0 μg/g egg weight ) exhibited enlargement and advanced differentiation of the Müllerian duct . These results indicate that P03372 is likely the principal P03372 involved in sex reversal as well as embryonic Müllerian duct survival and growth in American alligators .
