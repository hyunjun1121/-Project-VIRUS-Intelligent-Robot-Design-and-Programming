[ Functional characteristics of calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclase of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis ] . DB01373 -sensitive forms of adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) were revealed in most vertebrates and invertebrates and also in some unicellular organisms , in particular ciliates . We have shown for the first time that calcium cations influence the AC activity of ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis . These cations at the concentrations of 0.2-20 microM stimulated the enzyme activity , and maximum of catalytic effect was observed at 2 microM Ca2+ . DB01373 cations at a concentrations of 100 microM or higher inhibited the AC activity . P62158 antagonists W-5 and W-7 at the concentrations of 20-100 microM inhibited the catalytic effect induced by 5 microM Ca2+ and blocked the effect at higher concentrations of Ca2+ . DB00477 , another calmodulin antagonist , reduced Ca2+-stimulated AC activity only at the concentrations of 200-1000 microM . AC stimulating effects of serotonin , P01133 and DB02527 increased in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ . AC stimulating effects of P01133 , DB02527 and insulin decreased in the presence of 100 microM Ca2+ , and AC stimulating effect of DB02527 decreased also in the presence of calmodulin antagonists ( 1 mM ) . At the same time , stimulating effect of D-glucose in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin antagonists did not change essentially . The data obtained speak in favor of the presence of calcium-sensitive forms of AC in ciliate T. pyriformis which mediate enzyme stimulation by P01133 , DB02527 , insulin , and serotonin .
