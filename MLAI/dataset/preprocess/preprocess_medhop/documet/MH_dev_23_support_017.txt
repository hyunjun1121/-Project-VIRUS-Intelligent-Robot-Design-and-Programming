DB00293 ( DB00293 ) : from concept to care , a programme in rational drug discovery . DB00158 -based anticancer drugs with specificity for thymidylate synthase ( TS ) have come of age . Ideas nurtured in the early 1970s led to the first-generation of antifolates with TS and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitory activities . Compounds with increased selectivity for TS followed with the highly specific inhibitor , CB3717 being synthesised in 1979 at the Institute of Cancer Research ( ICR ) . CB3717 had significant clinical activity but its development had to be abandoned because its low aqueous solubility led to occasional nephrotoxicity . Collaborative laboratory studies between the ICR and ICI Pharmaceuticals ( later to become Zeneca Pharmaceuticals ) led to the discovery of DB00293 ( DB00293 ) , the first antifolate to be licensed for the treatment of cancer ( UK 1995 ) in nearly 40 years and the first new drug for colorectal cancer in about 35 years . DB00293 belongs to a class of compounds that use the reduced-folate carrier ( P41440 ) for uptake into cells and which are excellent substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . This paper reviews the underlying philosophies , and the milestones reached during the development of DB00293 .
