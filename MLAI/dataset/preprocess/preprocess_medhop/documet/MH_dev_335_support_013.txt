Genetic characterisation of circulating fetal cells allows non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis . OBJECTIVES : Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) gene . The purpose of this study was to develop a molecular method to characterise both paternal and maternal P13569 alleles in DNA from circulating fetal cells ( CFCs ) isolated by ISET ( isolation by size of epithelial tumour/trophoblastic cells ) . METHODS : The molecular protocol was defined by developing the F508del mutation analysis and addressing it both to single trophoblastic cells , isolated by ISET and identified by short tandem repeats ( STR ) genotyping , and to pooled trophoblastic genomes , thus avoiding the risk of allele drop out ( Q96SZ5 ) . This protocol was validated in 100 leucocytes from F508del carriers and subsequently blindly applied to the blood ( 5 mL ) of 12 pregnant women , at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation , whose offspring had a 1/4 risk of CF . Ten couples were carriers of F508del mutation , while two were carriers of unknown P13569 mutations . RESULTS : Results showed that one fetus was affected , seven were heterozygous carriers of a P13569 mutation , and four were healthy homozygotes . These findings were consistent with those obtained by chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) . CONCLUSION : Our data show that the ISET-CF approach affords reliable prenatal diagnosis ( P01160 ) of cystic fibrosis and is potentially applicable to pregnant women at risk of having an affected child , thus avoiding the risk of iatrogenic miscarriage .
