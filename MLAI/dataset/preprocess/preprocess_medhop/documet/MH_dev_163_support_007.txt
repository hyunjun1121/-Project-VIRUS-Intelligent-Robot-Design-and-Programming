DB06643 for the treatment of bone metastases in advanced breast cancer . In women with advanced breast cancer , approximately three-quarters develop metastases to the bone , with a median survival after diagnosis of 2-3 years . Receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ( Q9Y6Q6 ) and Q9Y6Q6 ligand ( O14788 ) belong to a signal pathway highly implicated in the development of bone metastases . DB06643 , a human monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specificity for O14788 , prevents the O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 interaction and inhibits osteoclast formation and function , thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass . DB06643 compared with zoledronic acid showed superior efficacy in delaying time to first-on study SRE and time to first- and subsequent-on study SREs as well as reduction in bone turnover markers . These results led to the approval of denosumab by the European Medicines Agency ( P15941 ) and the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors , including breast cancer .
