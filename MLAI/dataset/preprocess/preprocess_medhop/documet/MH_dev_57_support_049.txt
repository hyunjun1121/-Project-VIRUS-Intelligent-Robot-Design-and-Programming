1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its receptor inhibit the chenodeoxycholic acid-dependent transactivation by farnesoid X receptor . Farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) , the receptor for bile acids , including chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , which also includes the receptors for retinoic acid , vitamin D ( D3 ) , thyroid hormone , thiazolidinedione and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol . Here , we have evaluated the effects of a series of ligands and their receptors on the promoter activity induced by DB06777 / Q96RI1 . The kidney cell line , CV1 , was cotransfected with Q96RI1 -expression plasmid and the luciferase-based reporter gene that has a thymidine kinase promoter fused to the canonical Q96RI1 -responsive element or the natural promoter for the small heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) , bile salt export pump ( O95342 ) , and ileum bile acid ( P51161 ) gene . D3 and its receptor ( P11473 ) inhibited the transactivation of all four reporter constructs that are enhanced by DB06777 / Q96RI1 . The effect of D3 on the expression of the O95342 and Q15466 genes in HepG2 cells and that of the P51161 gene in Caco-2 cells were confirmed by reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR . Deletion analysis of P11473 revealed that its ligand-binding domain ( LBD ) is responsible for the repression and the DNA-binding domain ( DBD ) is dispensable . Specific interaction between Q96RI1 and P11473 was detected with the in vitro pull-down assay using chimeric Q96RI1 or P11473 fused to glutathione-S-transferase .
