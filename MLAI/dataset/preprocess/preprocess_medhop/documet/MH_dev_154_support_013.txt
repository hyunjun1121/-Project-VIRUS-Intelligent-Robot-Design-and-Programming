Differential roles of Q03405 in peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis . Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States . Most cases are diagnosed at late stages , with the solid tumor masses growing as peritoneal implants , or floating within the ascitic fluid ( peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis ) . Despite aggressive surgical " debulking , " recurrence of recalcitrant disease is frequent with poor patient survival . Efforts to improve survival rates are hindered by lack of biomarkers that can detect and effectively treat ovarian cancer in its early stages . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is a multifunctional receptor involved in a myriad of tumor cell processes . However , the role of host Q03405 in ovarian cancer is still elusive . To define the potential proinflammatory role of Q03405 in ovarian cancer , first , using a syngeneic murine model in Q03405 (-/-) mice , we found that ablation of Q03405 restrained tumor take and peritoneal implants and prolonged the survival of Q03405 (-/-) mice compared with their Q03405 (+/+) counterparts . Ascitic fluid accumulation was significantly decreased in Q03405 (-/-) mice with decreased macrophage infiltration . Second , in vitro mechanistic studies revealed that host Q03405 is involved in the multiple steps of peritoneal metastatic cascade . Third , we evaluated the prognostic utility of tumor and stromal Q03405 in human ovarian cancer tissue microarray . In summary , our studies indicated that Q03405 plays a significant role in ovarian cancer cell-stromal crosstalk and contributes to increased vascular permeability and inflammatory ovarian cancer microenvironment . This provides a rationale for targeting the Q03405 with either specific neutralizing antibodies or targeting its downstream inflammatory effectors in patients with ovarian cancer .
