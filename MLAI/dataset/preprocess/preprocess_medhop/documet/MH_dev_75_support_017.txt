Contact sensitization to oxazolone : involvement of both interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 in oxazolone-specific Ig and T-cell responses . The synthesis and role of several lymphokines were examined during contact sensitization to oxazolone ( OX ) . Application of OX to the skin of mice increased the delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response to challenge , serum titres of OX-specific IgG1 and IgG2a , and draining lymph node cell ( LNC ) numbers . At day 3 , LN contained detectable interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) , interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) but not P60568 or P08700 mRNAs ; P08700 and higher levels of P05112 , P01579 and GM- P04141 mRNAs were measured after 24 hr culture with anti-CD3 antibody in OX-primed but not unprimed LNC . As a result of sensitization , LNC secreted P08700 constitutively and produced elevated levels of P60568 , P08700 , P05112 and P01579 in response to anti-CD3 antibody ; a similar but weaker lymphokine response was recalled by OX-protein conjugate . P01730 + cells were the major source of the anti-CD3-induced lymphokines except P01579 , which was derived mainly from CD8+ cells . Since both P05112 and P01579 were synthesized by OX-primed LNC in vivo and in vitro , their role was investigated by administering anti-lymphokine antibodies at the time of sensitization . Anti- P05112 treatment reduced OX-specific serum IgG1 titres without affecting IgG2a titres , whereas anti- P01579 treatment reduced IgG2a but not IgG1 titres . Although neither antibody altered DTH responsiveness , anti- P01579 treatment markedly increased P05112 production by P01730 + LNC and reduced P01579 production in vitro , particularly by P01730 + cells . We conclude that endogenous P05112 and P01579 reciprocally influence the isotype of the Ig response to OX and that P01579 also affects the relative levels of P05112 and P01579 synthesis by P01730 + LNC .
