The anti-androgen drug dutasteride renders triple negative breast cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy via inhibition of HIF-1α-/ P15692 -signaling . BACKGROUND : Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) is characterized by lack of expression of both estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as lack of amplification of P04626 . Patients with TNBC carry an unfavorable prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes given that endocrine or P04626 targeted therapies are not effective , rendering chemotherapy the sole effective treatment option to date . Therefore , there is a high demand for additional novel treatment options . FINDINGS : We previously published a list of genes showing both higher gene expression rates in TNBC and , in addition , are known to encode targets of non-oncologic drugs . P18405 , which encodes the type-1 isoform of the steroid-5alpha-reductase , which is involved in androgen metabolism , was found to be one of these genes . DB01126 is a dual blocker of both the type-1 and type-2 isoform of P18405 and is indicated in the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia . Treatment of TNBC cell lines with dutasteride was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability , altered protein expression of P15692 and HIF-1α and increased chemosensitivity . CONCLUSION : Our results demonstrate that the P18405 -corresponding anti-androgenic drug dutasteride might act as a combinatorial therapeutic option besides standard chemotherapy in highly aggressive TNBC .
