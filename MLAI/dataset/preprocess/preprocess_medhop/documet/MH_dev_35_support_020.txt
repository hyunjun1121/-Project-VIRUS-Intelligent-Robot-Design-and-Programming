P41134 enhances docetaxel cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells through inhibition of P38936 . To identify potential mechanisms underlying prostate cancer chemotherapy response and resistance , we compared the gene expression profiles in high-risk human prostate cancer specimens before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical prostatectomy . Among the molecular signatures associated with chemotherapy , transcripts encoding inhibitor of DNA binding 1 ( P41134 ) were significantly upregulated . The patient biochemical relapse status was monitored in a long-term follow-up . Patients with P41134 upregulation were found to be associated with longer relapse-free survival than patients without P41134 increase . This in vivo clinical association was mechanistically investigated . The chemotherapy-induced P41134 upregulation was recapitulated in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP . DB01248 dose-dependently induced P41134 transcription , which was mediated by P41134 promoter E-box chromatin modification and c-Myc binding . Stable P41134 overexpression in LNCaP increased cell proliferation , promoted G(1) cell cycle progression , and enhanced docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity . These changes were accompanied by a decrease in cellular mitochondria content , an increase in P10415 phosphorylation at serine 70 , caspase-3 activation , and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage . In contrast , P41134 siRNA in the LNCaP and C42B cell lines reduced cell proliferation and decreased docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting cell death . P41134 -mediated chemosensitivity enhancement was in part due to P41134 suppression of P38936 . Overexpression of P38936 in LNCaP- P41134 -overexpressing cells restored the P38936 level and reversed P41134 -enhanced chemosensitivity . These molecular data provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed in vivo clinical association between P41134 upregulation and relapse-free survival . Taken together , it shows that P41134 expression has a novel therapeutic role in prostate cancer chemotherapy and prognosis .
