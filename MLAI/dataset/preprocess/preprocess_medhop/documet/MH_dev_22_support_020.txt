New therapies in P04626 -positive breast cancer : a major step towards a cure of the disease ? Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) predicts a poor prognosis in metastatic breast cancer . While the introduction of P04626 -targeted therapies , such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib , has significantly improved outcomes in P04626 + breast cancer compared with previously available therapies , use of these targeted therapies is often limited by the development of drug resistance and tolerability issues . These limitations create the need for further development and investigation of new targeted therapies that show potent and selective inhibition of these targets or closely connected molecular pathways . Recently , several agents have demonstrated promising activity in P04626 + metastatic breast cancer , either as monotherapy or in combination therapy , including the tyrosine-kinase inhibitors neratinib ( HKI-272 ) and afatinib ( BIBW-2992 ) and the anti- P04626 monoclonal antibodies pertuzumab and trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) . Agents that target other molecular pathways , such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , mammalian target of rapamycin , P19957 -kinases , insulin-like growth factor ( IGFR ) , HSP-90 , and other kinases also have potential , in combination with anti- P04626 and/or other systemic therapies , to be active in this subtype of breast cancer . Innovative clinical studies are required in well-characterized patient populations to define the true clinical value of these emerging new approaches .
