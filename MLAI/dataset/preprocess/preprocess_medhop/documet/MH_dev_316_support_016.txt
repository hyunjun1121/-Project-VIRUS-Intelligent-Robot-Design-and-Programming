Endothelial nitric oxide synthase is essential for the P04035 inhibitor cerivastatin to promote collateral growth in response to ischemia . HMG- DB01992 ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) reductase inhibitors , or statins , are prescribed widely to lower cholesterol . Accumulating evidence indicates that statins have various effects on vascular cells , which are independent of their lipid-lowering effect . Here , we tested the hypothesis that statins may augment collateral flow to ischemic tissues . We induced hind-limb ischemia in wild-type mice and treated them with either saline or cerivastatin . DB00439 enhanced the blood flow recovery dramatically as determined by Laser Doppler imaging . The mice treated with saline displayed frequent autoamputation of the ischemic toe , which was prevented completely by cerivastatin . Anti-CD31 immunostaining revealed that cerivastatin significantly increased the capillary density . Endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity was enhanced markedly in the mice treated with cerivastatin . The angiogenic effect of cerivastatin was abrogated in P29474 deficient ( P29474 -/- ) mice . These results indicate that P29474 is essential for cerivastatin to promote collateral growth in response to ischemia .
