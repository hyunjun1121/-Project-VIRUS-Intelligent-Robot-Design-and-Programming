Polymorphisms of dopamine receptor/transporter genes and risk of non-small cell lung cancer . BACKGROUND : The dopaminergic pathway may be of interest in assessing risk of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Dopamine receptors are expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and human lung tumours , and dopamine inhibits both cell proliferation in vitro and growth of lung tumour xenografts in nude mice . Moreover , dopamine selectively inhibits the vascular permeability and angiogenic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 / P15692 ) . The bioavailability of dopamine is regulated by dopamine receptors D2 ( P14416 ) , D4 ( P21917 ) and dopamine transporter 1 ( Q01959 / Q01959 ) genes . METHODS : We have analysed 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms in P14416 , P21917 and Q01959 / Q01959 genes in relation to lung cancer risk in a case-control study of smoking subjects . The study subjects were 413 healthy individuals from general population and 335 NSCLC cases . Both cases and controls were Caucasians of Norwegian origin . RESULTS : We demonstrate that P14416 polymorphisms -141Cdel , 3208G > T , TaqIB ; P21917 -521C > T and Q01959 / Q01959 -1476T > G are associated with a two- to five-fold increased NSCLC risk . The variant alleles of P14416 1412A > G and 960C > G had protective effects . CONCLUSION : The dopamine receptor/transport gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk of NSCLC among smokers . The data show that the polymorphisms resulting in lower dopamine bioavailability were associated with increased risk of NSCLC .
