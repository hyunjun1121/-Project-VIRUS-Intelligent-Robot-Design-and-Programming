Retinoic acid treatment enhances the acetylcholine contents in the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera-2 . Human NTera-2/clone D1 teratocarcinoma cells are induced by retinoic acid ( RA ) to differentiate into postmitotic cells with morphological and biochemical characteristics of embryonic human neurones . Currently only limited information concerning peptide-contents and neurotransmitter pools of these cells is available . Zeller and Strauss [ Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995;13(5):437 ] described an increase in choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) activity in RA-treated , but not in untreated NTera-2 cells , suggesting the induction of a cholinergic phenotype during treatment with RA . In the present study we investigated the effect of RA-differentiation on the amount of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine ( ACh ) , and dopamine in NTera-2 in order to specify the transmitter phenotype induced by RA-differentiation . We found that a 4-week treatment of NTera-2 cells with 10 microM RA markedly increased the ACh-content of these cells , while dopamine levels were unchanged . Depolarisation with potassium ( 60 mM ) enhanced ACh-outflow in the differentiated cells in a Ca(++) dependent way . Also neuropeptides like DB05875 and P01303 were detectable in the undifferentiated NTera-2 cells , while vasointestinal peptide ( P01282 ) could not be found in either precursor or RA-differentiated cells . Differentiation was accompanied by a marked reduction of neutral endopeptidase enzyme activity and aminopeptidase activity . From these observations it was concluded that RA induces a cholinergic neurochemical differentiation of this human teratocarcinoma cell line , and that these cells might provide a model system to investigate cholinergic properties of human origin .
