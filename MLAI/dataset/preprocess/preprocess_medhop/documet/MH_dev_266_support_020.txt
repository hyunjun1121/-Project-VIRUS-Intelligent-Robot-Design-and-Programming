Pharmacological profile of astemizole-derived compounds at the histamine H1 and H4 receptor -- H1/H4 receptor selectivity . DB00637 , a P35367 antagonist shows high affinity to the histamine H1 receptor but only a moderate affinity to the histamine H4 receptor . This study aims to modify the astemizole to keep high affinity to the histamine H1 receptor and to increase affinity to the histamine H4 receptor . Therefore , 13 astemizole-derived compounds and astemizole-JNJ7777120-derived hybrid compounds were synthesized and pharmacologically characterized at the histamine H1 and H4 receptors . The new compounds show affinity to the histamine H1 receptor in the pK i range from 5.3 to 8.8 , whereas the affinity of these compounds to the histamine H4 receptor was surprisingly rather low ( pK i from 4.4 to 5.6 ) . Three representative compounds were docked into the histamine H1 receptor and molecular dynamic studies were performed to explain the binding mode and the experimental results on a molecular level . Furthermore , taking into account the binding mode of compounds with high affinity to the histamine H4 receptor , a H1/H4-pharmacophore hypothesis was developed .
