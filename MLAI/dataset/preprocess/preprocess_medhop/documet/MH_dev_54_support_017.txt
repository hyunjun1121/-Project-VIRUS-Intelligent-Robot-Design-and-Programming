Porous polyimide membranes prepared by wet phase inversion for use in low dielectric applications . A wet phase inversion process of polyamic acid ( PAA ) allowed fabrication of a porous membrane of polyimide ( PI ) with the combination of a low dielectric constant ( 1.7 ) and reasonable mechanical properties ( Tensile strain : 8.04 % , toughness : 3.4 MJ/m3 , tensile stress : 39.17 MPa , and young modulus : 1.13 GPa ) , with further thermal imidization process of PAA . PAA was simply synthesized from purified pyromellitic dianhydride ( PMDA ) and 4,4-oxydianiline ( ODA ) in two different reaction solvents such as Î³- DB04699 ( Q9BVC4 ) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone ( NMP ) , which produce Mw/ P07237 of 630,000/1.45 and 280,000/2.0 , respectively . The porous PAA membrane was fabricated by the wet phase inversion process based on a solvent/non-solvent system via tailored composition between Q9BVC4 and NMP . The porosity of PI , indicative of a low electric constant , decreased with increasing concentration of Q9BVC4 , which was caused by sponge-like formation . However , due to interplay between the low electric constant ( structural formation ) and the mechanical properties , Q9BVC4 was employed for further exploration , using toluene and acetone vs. DI-water as a coagulation media . Non-solvents influenced determination of the PAA membrane size and porosity . With this approach , insight into the interplay between dielectric properties and mechanical properties will inform a wide range of potential low-k material applications .
