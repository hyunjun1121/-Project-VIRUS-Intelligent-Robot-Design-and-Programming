A clinical evaluation of statin pleiotropy : statins selectively and dose-dependently reduce vascular inflammation . Statins are thought to reduce vascular inflammation through lipid independent mechanisms . Evaluation of such an effect in atherosclerotic disease is complicated by simultaneous effects on lipid metabolism . Abdominal aortic aneurysms ( AAA ) are part of the atherosclerotic spectrum of diseases . Unlike atherosclerotic occlusive disease , AAA is not lipid driven , thus allowing direct evaluation of putative anti-inflammatory effects . The anti-inflammatory potency of increasing doses ( 0 , 20 or 40 mg/day ) simvastatin or atorvastatin was evaluated in 63 patients that were at least 6 weeks on statin therapy and who underwent open AAA repair . A comprehensive analysis using immunohistochemistry , mRNA and protein analyses was applied on aortic wall samples collected during surgery . The effect of statins on AAA growth was analyzed in a separate prospective study in incorporating 142 patients . Both statins equally effectively and dose-dependently reduced aortic wall expression of NFκB regulated mediators ( i.e. P05231 ( P < 0.001 ) and P13500 ( P < 0.001 ) ) ; shifted macrophage polarization towards a M2 phenotype ( P < 0.0003 ) ; selectively reduced macrophage-related markers such as cathepsin K and S ( P < 0.009 and 0.0027 respectively ) , and P09917 ( P < 0.0009 ) , and reduced vascular wall NFκB activity ( 40 mg/day group , P < 0.016 ) . No effect was found on other cell types . Evaluation of the clinical efficacy of statins to reduce AAA progression did not indicate an effect of statins on aneurysm growth ( P < 0.337 ) . Hence , in the context of AAA the clinical relevance of statins pleiotropy appears minimal .
