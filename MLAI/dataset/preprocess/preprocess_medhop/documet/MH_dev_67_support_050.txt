Cyclooxygenase isozymes are expressed in human myeloma cells but not involved in anti-proliferative effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors . Considering possible tumorigenic activity of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) isozymes in myeloma , we examined expression levels of P23219 and -2 in seven human myeloma cell lines ( Q5SW96 -77 , IM-9 , RPMI-8226 , HPC , HS-Sultan , TSPC-1 , and U-266 ) . As analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , all the cell lines constitutively expressed P23219 , while P35354 levels markedly varied among different cell lines . Induction of P35354 by phorbol ester was observed in RPMI-8226 and HPC cells . In contrast , P35354 was constitutively expressed in Q5SW96 -77 and IM-9 cells . Moreover , the high expression level of P35354 protein in Q5SW96 -77 cells was verified by Western blotting . Intact cells of Q5SW96 -77 converted 14C-labeled arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 , F2alpha , and D2 , and this activity was dose-dependently inhibited by selective P35354 inhibitors ( SC-58125 and NS-398 ) , a non-selective P36551 inhibitor ( indomethacin ) , and relatively high concentrations of a selective P23219 inhibitor ( SC-560 ) . These P36551 inhibitors also suppressed the proliferation of Q5SW96 -77 cells , but significant suppression was seen only at 100 microM , a much higher concentration than those sufficient for the P36551 inhibition . Moreover , proliferation of the myeloma cells lacking P35354 was also suppressed by 100 microM of SC-58125 . These results suggested that the anti-proliferative effect of the P36551 inhibitors is independent of the inhibition of P35354 .
