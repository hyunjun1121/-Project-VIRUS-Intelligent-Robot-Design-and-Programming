Effect of kinase inhibitors on the therapeutic properties of monoclonal antibodies . Targeted therapies of malignancies currently consist of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors . The combination of these novel agents raises the issue of potential antagonisms . We evaluated the potential effect of 4 kinase inhibitors , including the Q06187 inhibitor ibrutinib , and 3 PI3K inhibitors idelalisib , DB00238 -BEZ235 and LY294002 , on the effects of the 3 monoclonal antibodies , rituximab and obinutuzumab ( directed against P11836 ) and trastuzumab ( directed against P04626 ) . We found that ibrutinib potently inhibits antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity exerted by all antibodies , with a 50 % inhibitory concentration of 0.2 microM for trastuzumab , 0.5 microM for rituximab and 2 microM for obinutuzumab , suggesting a lesser effect in combination with obinutuzumab than with rituximab . The 4 kinase inhibitors were found to inhibit phagocytosis by fresh human neutrophils , as well as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis induced by the 3 antibodies . Conversely co-administration of ibrutinib with rituximab , obinutuzumab or trastuzumab did not demonstrate any inhibitory effect of ibrutinib in vivo in murine xenograft models . In conclusion , some kinase inhibitors , in particular , ibrutinib , are likely to exert inhibitory effects on innate immune cells . However , these effects do not compromise the antitumor activity of monoclonal antibodies in vivo in the models that were evaluated .
