DB00065 does not activate replication of lymphotropic herpesviruses in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis . OBJECTIVE : The reactivation of human lymphotropic herpesviruses can be related to the intensity of immunosuppression . We analysed the risk of reactivation of lymphotropic herpesviruses in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with an anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) agent ( infliximab ) . METHODS : Fifteen patients were treated with infliximab ( 3 mg/kg ) at weeks 0 , 2 and 6 . Samples of both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were obtained before treatment ( week 0 ) and before each infusion at weeks 2 and 6 . Samples were analysed using a multiplex qualitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) for lymphotropic herpesviruses . Quantification of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) viral load ( copies/ml ) was performed using quantitative PCR . Reactivation was defined as the presence of viral DNA in plasma . Latent infection was defined as the presence of viral DNA in PBMC samples but not in plasma . RESULTS : On baseline , latent CMV infection was detected in eight patients ( 53.3 % ) , human herpesviruses-6 ( HHV-6 ) in two ( 13.3 % ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) in seven ( 46.6 % ) , CMV + HHV-6 in one ( 6.6 % ) , CMV + EBV in two ( 13.3 % ) and HHV-6 + EBV in one ( 6.6 % ) . Viral reactivation related to infliximab treatment was not observed . There was only one patient who had HHV-6 reactivation , but this was already detected in the baseline sample . CONCLUSIONS : DB00065 treatment does not induce replication of human lymphotropic herpesviruses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Thus , herpesviruses prophylaxis would not be indicated in these patients .
