Matrix proteinase inhibition by DB05387 , a multifunctional antiangiogenic compound . BACKGROUND : Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) play an important role in tissue remodeling under normal physiological and pathological conditions and are thus attractive targets for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes . Here , we examined the effect of DB05387 , an orally bioavailable standardized extract made of cartilage that shows significant antiangiogenic and antimetastatic properties in vivo , on the activity of various members of the MMP family . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The effect of DB05387 on the activity of MMPs was assessed by fluorimetric assays and by substrate gel zymography . RESULTS : DB05387 markedly inhibits the gelatinolytic activity of P08253 and to a lesser extent those of P03956 , P09237 , P14780 and P45452 . DB05387 also inhibited the elastinolytic activities of P08253 and P14780 as well as P39900 ( metalloelastase ) , porcine pancreatic elastase ( PPE ) , and human leukocyte elastase ( P08246 ) . Western blot analysis revealed the presence within DB05387 of immunoreactive P01033 -like proteins , suggesting that these proteins may be at least partly responsible for the observed MMP inhibition . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together , these results demonstrate that DB05387 contains P01033 -like proteins that could be responsible for the specific inhibition of MMPs . Given the recent studies suggesting the presence within this compound of specific inhibitor(s) of endothelial cell proliferation , DB05387 appears as a pleotropic agent able to interfere with several biochemical steps leading to angiogenesis and to other physiopathological conditions . Since DB05387 is currently under Phase III clinical investigations , these findings are also of considerable importance for our understanding of its anticancer properties .
