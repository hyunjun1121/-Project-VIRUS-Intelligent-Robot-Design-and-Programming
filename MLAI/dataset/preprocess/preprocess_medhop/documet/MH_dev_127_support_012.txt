Comparative effects of the anti-platelet drugs , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , and cilostazol on aspirin-induced gastric bleeding and damage in rats . AIMS : The present study compared the effects of frequently used anti-platelet drugs , such as clopidogrel , ticlopidine , and cilostazol , on the gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses induced by intraluminal perfusion with 25 mM aspirin acidified with 25 mM HCl ( acidified ASA ) in rats . MAIN METHODS : The stomach was perfused with acidified ASA at a rate of 0.4 ml/min for 60 min under urethane anesthesia , and gastric bleeding was measured as the concentration of hemoglobin in the luminal perfusate , which was collected every 15 min . DB00758 ( 10-100mg/kg ) , ticlopidine ( 10-300 mg/kg ) , or cilostazol ( 3-30 mg/kg ) was given p.o . 24h or 90 min before the perfusion of acidified ASA , respectively . KEY FINDINGS : Perfusion of the stomach with acidified ASA alone led to slight bleeding and lesions in the stomach . The pretreatment with clopidogrel , even though it did not cause bleeding or damage by itself , dose-dependently increased the gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses induced by acidified ASA . DB00208 also aggravated the severity of damage by increasing gastric bleeding , and the effects of ticlopidine at 300 mg/kg were equivalent to those of clopidogrel at 100mg/kg . In contrast , cilostazol dose-dependently decreased gastric bleeding and damage in response to acidified ASA . SIGNIFICANCE : These results demonstrated that clopidogrel and ticlopidine , Q9H244 receptor inhibitors , increased gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses to acidified ASA , to the same extent , while cilostazol , a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor , suppressed these responses . Therefore , cilostazol may be safely used in dual anti-platelet therapy combined with ASA , without increasing the risk of gastric bleeding .
