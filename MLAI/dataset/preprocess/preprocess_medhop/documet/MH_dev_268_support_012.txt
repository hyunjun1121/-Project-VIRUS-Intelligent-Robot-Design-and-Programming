Different responsiveness of endothelial cells to vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor added to culture media under gravity and simulated microgravity . When incubated under simulated microgravity ( s-microg ) , endothelial cells ( EC ) form tubular structures that resemble vascular intimas . This delayed formation of 3D EC structures begins between the 5th and 7th day of culturing EC under conditions of s-microg , when double-row cell assemblies become visible . With the aim of learning about this initial phase of tubular structure formation , we found that NFkappaBp65 protein content was similar in all cell populations , but gene and protein expression of phosphokinase A catalytic subunit , phosphokinase Calpha , and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 was altered in cells cultured under s-microg . Apoptosis remained below 30 % in all EC cultures . In contrast to controls , the 7-day-old s-microg cultures contained 3D aggregates with proliferating cells , enhanced numbers of necrotic cells , and osteopontin-negative EC as well as supernatants with reduced quantities of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , soluble P25942 , P29965 , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 , Q14116 , complement P01024 , and P04275 . P15692 and/or P09038 ( 10 ng/mL ) application influenced the accumulation of proteins in supernatants more profoundly under 1 g than under s-microg . These findings provide evidence that phosphokinase Calpha plays a key role in tube formation . Improving the interaction of P15692 and/or P09038 with EC under s-microg could enhance the engineering of vascular intimas .
