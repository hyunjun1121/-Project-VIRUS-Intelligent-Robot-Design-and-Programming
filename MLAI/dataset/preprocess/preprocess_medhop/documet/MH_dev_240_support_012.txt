Janus-faced role of endothelial NO synthase in vascular disease : uncoupling of oxygen reduction from NO synthesis and its pharmacological reversal . Endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) is the predominant enzyme responsible for vascular NO synthesis . A functional P29474 transfers electrons from NADPH to its heme center , where L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO . Common conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis , such as hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus and smoking , are associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and reduced amounts of bioactive NO in the vessel wall . NADPH oxidases represent major sources of ROS in cardiovascular pathophysiology . NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide avidly interacts with P29474 -derived NO to form peroxynitrite ( ONOO(-) ) , which oxidizes the essential NOS cofactor (6R-) DB00360 ( BH(4) ) . As a consequence , oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis , thereby rendering NOS to a superoxide-producing pro-atherosclerotic enzyme . Supplementation with BH(4) corrects P29474 dysfunction in several animal models and in patients . Administration of high local doses of the antioxidant L-ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) improves endothelial function , whereas large-scale clinical trials do not support a strong role for oral vitamin C and/or E in reducing cardiovascular disease . Statins , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers have the potential of reducing vascular oxidative stress . Finally , novel approaches are being tested to block pathways leading to oxidative stress ( e.g. protein kinase C ) or to upregulate antioxidant enzymes .
