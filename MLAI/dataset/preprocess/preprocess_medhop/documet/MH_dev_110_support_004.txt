AB-CHMINACA , AB-PINACA , and FUBIMINA : Affinity and Potency of Novel Synthetic Cannabinoids in Producing Δ9- DB00470 -Like Effects in Mice . Diversion of synthetic cannabinoids for abuse began in the early 2000s . Despite legislation banning compounds currently on the drug market , illicit manufacturers continue to release new compounds for recreational use . This study examined new synthetic cannabinoids , AB-CHMINACA ( N-[1-amino-3-methyl-oxobutan-2-yl]-1-[cyclohexylmethyl]-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide ) , AB-PINACA [ N-(1-amino-3-methyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide ] , and FUBIMINA [ ( 1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-benzo[d]imadazol-2-yl ) (naphthalen-1-yl)methanone ] , with the hypothesis that these compounds , like those before them , would be highly susceptible to abuse . Cannabinoids were examined in vitro for binding and activation of P21554 receptors , and in vivo for pharmacological effects in mice and in Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ(9)-THC ) discrimination . AB-CHMINACA , AB-PINACA , and FUBIMINA bound to and activated P21554 and CB2 receptors , and produced locomotor suppression , antinociception , hypothermia , and catalepsy . Furthermore , these compounds , along with JWH-018 [ 1-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole ] , Q13515 ,497 [ rel-5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2- [ ( 1R,3S ) -3-hydroxycyclohexyl ] -phenol ] , and WIN55,212-2 ( [ ( 3R ) -2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl ] -1-naphthalenyl-methanone , monomethanesulfonate ) , substituted for Δ(9)-THC in Δ(9)-THC discrimination . Rank order of potency correlated with P21554 receptor-binding affinity , and all three compounds were full agonists in [(35)S]GTPγS binding , as compared with the partial agonist Δ(9)-THC . Indeed , AB-CHMINACA and AB-PINACA exhibited higher efficacy than most known full agonists of the P21554 receptor . Preliminary analysis of urinary metabolites of the compounds revealed the expected hydroxylation . AB-PINACA and AB-CHMINACA are of potential interest as research tools due to their unique chemical structures and high P21554 receptor efficacies . Further studies on these chemicals are likely to include research on understanding cannabinoid receptors and other components of the endocannabinoid system that underlie the abuse of synthetic cannabinoids .
