DB00005 maintains the clinical benefit achieved by infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who discontinued infliximab because of side effects . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy of switching to etanercept treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who already responded to infliximab , but presented side effects . METHODS : Charts of 553 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were retrospectively reviewed to select patients who responded to the treatment with infliximab and switched to etanercept because of occurrence of adverse effects . Clinical data were gathered during 24 weeks of etanercept treatment and for the same period of infliximab treatment before infliximab was stopped . Disease Activity Score computed on 44 joints ( DAS-44 ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( P03372 ) 1st hour , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) of pain , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , and C reactive protein ( CRP ) were assessed every 8 weeks . RESULTS : 37 patients were analysed . Adverse events to infliximab were mostly infusion reactions . No statistically significant difference between infliximab , before withdrawal , and etanercept , after 24 weeks , was detected in terms of DAS-44 ( 2.7 and 1.9 , respectively ) , HAQ ( 0.75 and 0.75 , respectively ) , P03372 ( 21 and 14 , respectively ) and CRP ( 0.5 and 0.3 , respectively ) . VAS pain decreased significantly after switching to etanercept treatment ( 40 and 24 , respectively ; p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our study shows that etanercept maintains the clinical benefit achieved by infliximab , and suggests that a second tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha inhibitor can be the favourable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis when the first TNFalpha blocker has been withdrawn because of adverse events .
