P62158 interacts with DB00171 binding cassette transporter A1 to protect from calpain-mediated degradation and upregulates high-density lipoprotein generation . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the interaction of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) with calmodulin in relation to its calpain-mediated degradation because many calpain substrates bind calmodulin to regulate cellular functions . METHODS AND RESULTS : The activity of O95477 is regulated through proteolysis by calpain . An immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay revealed that O95477 directly binds calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner . The cytoplasmic loop of O95477 contains a typical calmodulin binding sequence of 1-5-8-14 motifs ( 1245 to 1257 amino acids ) . The peptide of this region showed binding to calmodulin , and deletion of the 1-5-8-14 motif abolished this interaction . This motif is located near the O95477 Pro- DB00142 - DB00133 - DB00156 sequence , and the presence of calmodulin/Ca(2+) protected the peptides from proteolysis by calpain . The knockdown of calmodulin by a specific small and interfering RNA increased the degradation of O95477 and decreased O95477 protein and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated lipid release . Surprisingly , calmodulin inhibitor W7 increased calmodulin binding to O95477 and protected it from calpain-mediated degradation , consistent with our previous finding that this compound increased apolipoprotein A-I-mediated cell cholesterol release . CONCLUSIONS : P62158 directly binds and stabilizes O95477 in the presence of Ca(2+) and increases the generation of high-density lipoprotein .
