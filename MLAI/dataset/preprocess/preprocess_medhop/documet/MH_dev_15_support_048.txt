The C-type lectin Q99685 expressed by dendritic cells detects glycan changes on P15941 in colon carcinoma . The epithelial mucin P15941 is a high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein frequently overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in adenocarcinoma . Mucins normally contain high amounts of O-linked carbohydrate structures that may influence immune reactions to this antigen . During malignant transformation , certain glyco-epitopes of P15941 , such as Tn-antigen , TF-antigen and their sialylated forms become exposed . The role of these glycan structures in tumor biology is unknown , but their presence is known to correlate with poor prognosis in several adenocarcinomas . We analyzed the potency of P15941 containing Tn-antigens ( P15941 -Tn ) to target C-type lectins that function as carbohydrate recognition and uptake molecules on dendritic cells ( DC ) . We identified the macrophage galactose type C-type lectin ( Q99685 ) , expressed by both DC and macrophages , as the receptor for recognition and binding of P15941 -Tn . To validate the occurrence of Q99685 - P15941 interactions in situ , we studied the binding of Q99685 to P15941 in primary colon carcinoma tissue . Isolation of P15941 out of colon carcinoma tissue showed strong binding activity to Q99685 . Interestingly , Q99685 binding to P15941 was highly correlated to binding by the lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin ( Q9Y251 ) , which is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer . The detection of Q99685 positive cells in situ at the tumor site together with the modified glycosylation status of P15941 to target Q99685 on DC suggests that Q99685 positive antigen presenting cells may play a role in tumor progression .
