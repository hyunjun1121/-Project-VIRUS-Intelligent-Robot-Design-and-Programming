Identification of a potential molecular link between the glucocorticoid and serotonergic signaling systems . P04150 ( GR ) and serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) ) signaling systems play a pivotal role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis , but the molecular nature of interactions between these two systems remain largely unidentified . We used computational and experimental approaches to evaluate if DNA-protein interactions would provide a molecular link for the interaction between 5-HT and GR systems . Bioinformatic analysis identified nine binding sites in various serotonin receptors ( P28221 , P30939 , P28223 , P46098 , and P50406 ) for transcription factors in the GR family . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) using HeLa nuclear extract and purified full-length GR verified most of the predicted DNA-protein interactions . Six binding sites verified by EMSA results were evolutionarily conserved in multiple species . Multiple lines of evidence from computational and experimental analyses in this study support the potential of a molecular link between 5-HT and GR signaling systems . This finding provides new approaches to studies directed at mechanisms for glucocorticoid negative feedback regulation of the Q9Y251 axis involving 5-HT and interventional studies directed to neuropsychiatric diseases .
