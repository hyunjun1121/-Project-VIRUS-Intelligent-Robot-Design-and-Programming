Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus in China . BACKGROUND : Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( PNDM ) is a rare disease , which is defined as the onset of diabetes before the age of 6 months with persistence through life . Infants with Q14654 or Q09428 genetic mutations may respond to oral sulfonylurea therapy . Currently , there are limited studies about the genetic analysis and long-term follow-up of PNDM . CASE PRESENTATION : We report four cases of PNDM . None of the infants or their parents had P01308 , Q14654 , or Q09428 genetic mutations . One infant underwent continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) and the other infants underwent multiple injections of insulin ( MII ) . In these infants , PNDM persisted from 35 months to 60 months of follow-up . Three infants maintained fairly stable blood sugar levels , and one infant had poor sugar control . CONCLUSIONS : We suggest that all of the infants with PNDM should undergo genetic evaluation . For infants without Q14654 and Q09428 genetic mutations , oral sulfonylurea should not be considered as treatment . CSII is a useful method for overcoming the difficulties of diabetes , and it may also improve the quality of life of both infants and their parents .
