Lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate is a potent inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi : prospect for chemotherapy of Chagas ' disease . Trypanosoma cruzi , a protozoan parasite , is the causative agent for Chagas ' disease , which poses serious public health problem in Latin America . The two drugs available for the treatment of this disease are effective only against recent infections and are toxic . P00374 ( P00374 ) has a proven track record as a drug target . The lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate ( DB01157 ) , which is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infection in AIDS patients , is a potent inhibitor of T. cruzi P00374 activity , with an inhibitory constant of 6.6 nM . The compound is also highly effective in killing T. cruzi parasites . The 50 and 90 % lethal dose values against the trypomastigote are 19 and 36 nM , and the corresponding values for the amastigote form are 26 and 72 nM , respectively . However , as DB01157 is also a good inhibitor of human P00374 , further improvement of the selectivity of this drug would be preferable . Identification of a novel antifolate selective against T. cruzi would open up new therapeutic avenues for treatment of Chagas ' disease .
