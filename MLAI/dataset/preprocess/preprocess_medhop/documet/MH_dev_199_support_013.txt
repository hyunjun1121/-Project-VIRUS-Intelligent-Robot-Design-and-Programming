Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 ( Q9UBN7 ) induces DNA damage and sensitizes transformed cells to anticancer agents . Q9UBN7 ( Q9UBN7 ) is structurally and functionally unique among the 11 human zinc-dependent histone deacetylases . Here we show that chemical inhibition with the Q9UBN7 -selective inhibitor tubacin significantly enhances cell death induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin and the pan-HDAC inhibitor DB02546 ( vorinostat ) in transformed cells ( LNCaP , MCF-7 ) , an effect not observed in normal cells ( human foreskin fibroblast cells ) . The inactive analogue of tubacin , nil-tubacin , does not sensitize transformed cells to these anticancer agents . Further , we show that down-regulation of Q9UBN7 expression by shRNA in LNCaP cells enhances cell death induced by etoposide , doxorubicin , and DB02546 . Tubacin in combination with DB02546 or etoposide is more potent than either drug alone in activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in transformed cells , as evidenced by an increase in PARP cleavage and partial inhibition of this effect by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk . Q9UBN7 inhibition with tubacin induces the accumulation of γ P16104 , an early marker of DNA double-strand breaks . Tubacin enhances DNA damage induced by etoposide or DB02546 as indicated by increased accumulation of γ P16104 and activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2 . Tubacin induces the expression of P35638 ( P35638 / P35638 ) , a transcription factor up-regulated in response to cellular stress . P35638 induction is further increased when tubacin is combined with DB02546 . These findings point to mechanisms by which Q9UBN7 -selective inhibition can enhance the efficacy of certain anti-cancer agents in transformed cells .
