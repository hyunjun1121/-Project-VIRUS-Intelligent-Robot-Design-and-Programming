New gene variants associated with venous thrombosis : a replication study in White and Black Americans . BACKGROUND : We evaluated 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) identified in three European case-control studies as risk factors for venous thrombosis . OBJECTIVES : We sought to replicate the positive findings from this report among Whites and to evaluate the association of these SNPs with venous thrombosis for the first time among Blacks . PATIENT/METHODS : These SNPs were evaluated in a case-control study of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism that included 1076 cases and 1239 controls . About 50 % of subjects were African Americans . We measured plasma factor ( F ) XI on a subset of subjects . RESULTS : Among Whites , positive findings for rs13146272 in the Q6ZWL3 gene , for rs3087505 in the P03952 gene and for rs3756008 and rs2036914 in the P03951 gene were found . We did not find significant associations for rs2227589 in the P01008 gene and for rs1613662 in the Q9HCN6 gene . Among Blacks , rs2036914 in P03951 and rs670659 in P49802 were related to venous thrombosis , but the study had limited statistical power for many SNPs . Among Blacks , plasma P03951 was related to two SNPs and the OR relating to the 90th percentile of the control distribution of plasma P03951 was 2.6 ( 95 % CI , 1.4 , 5.0 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our study supports the finding that genetic variants in the P03951 gene are risk factors for venous thrombosis among both Whites and Blacks , although the findings in Blacks require confirmation . A meta-analysis of five case-control studies indicates that rs2227589 in the P01008 gene , rs13146272 in the Q6ZWL3 gene and rs1613662 in the Q9HCN6 gene are risk factors for venous thrombosis among Whites .
