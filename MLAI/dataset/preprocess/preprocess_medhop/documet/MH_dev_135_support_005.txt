Porcine O60603 and Q9Y2C9 : identification and their involvement in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection . We successfully cloned and sequenced porcine toll-like receptor ( O60603 ) and Q9Y2C9 cDNA from porcine alveolar macrophages stimulated with 10 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . The open reading frames ( ORFs ) of the porcine O60603 and Q9Y2C9 cDNA were shown to be 2358 and 2391 bp in length and to encode 785 and 796 amino acids , respectively . The predicted amino acid sequence of porcine O60603 was 72.3 % homologous to human O60603 and 61.0 % homologous to murine O60603 . That of porcine Q9Y2C9 was 74.4 % homologous to human Q9Y2C9 and 66.1 % homologous to murine Q9Y2C9 . Porcine O60603 and Q9Y2C9 genes were both mapped to porcine chromosome 8 ( O60603 : SSC8q21.1 --> 21.5 ; Q9Y2C9 : SSC8p11.1 --> P38936 .1 ) by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) and radiation hybrid mapping . Western blot analysis confirmed that O60603 and Q9Y2C9 proteins were both expressed in porcine alveolar macrophages . Further , antiporcine O60603 and Q9Y2C9 antibodies synergistically blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) production by porcine alveolar macrophages stimulated with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae . These results indicated that both O60603 and Q9Y2C9 are important in the recognition of M. hyopneumoniae in porcine alveolar macrophages and will be useful in understanding innate immunity against M. hyopneumoniae .
