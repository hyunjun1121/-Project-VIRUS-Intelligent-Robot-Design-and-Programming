New-generation Q13639 receptor agonists : potential for treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : Gastrointestinal ( GI ) dysmotility is an important mechanism in functional GI disorders ( FGIDs ) including constipation , irritable bowel syndrome , functional dyspepsia , and gastroparesis . 5-hydroxytryptamine(4) ( 5-HT(4) ) receptors are targets for the treatment of GI motility disorders . However , older 5-HT(4) receptor agonists had limited clinical success because they were associated with changes in the function of the cardiac Q12809 potassium channel . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : We conducted a PubMed search using the following key words alone or in combination : 5-HT(4) , safety , toxicity , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , clinical trial , cardiac , hERG , arrhythmia , potassium current , elderly , prucalopride , ATI-7505 , and velusetrag ( DB05655 ) , to review mechanisms of action , clinical efficacy , safety and tolerability of three new-generation 5-HT(4) receptor agonists . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : DB06480 , ATI-7505 , and velusetrag ( DB05655 ) are highly selective , high-affinity 5-HT(4) receptor agonists that are devoid of action on other receptors within their therapeutic range . Their efficacy has been demonstrated in pharmacodynamic studies which demonstrate acceleration of colonic transit and , to a variable degree , in clinical trials that significantly relieve chronic constipation . Currently available evidence shows that the new 5-HT(4) receptor agonists have safe cardiac profiles . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : New-generation 5-HT(4) receptor agonists and future drugs targeting organ-specific splice variants are promising approaches to treat GI dysmotility , particularly colonic diseases .
