Expression Enhancement in DB00072 Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibody Production using Genomic Amplification with DB00563 . BACKGROUND : DB00072 ( Herceptin ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) which is used for specific treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with overexpression of P04626 /neu receptor . In this study , we have attempted to develop a biosimilar version of trastuzumab mAb . METHODS : According to in silico studies , the heavy and light chains of trastuzumab mAb were designed and constructed . The recombinant constructs were co-transfected in CHO DG44 cell line . Stable transformants were selected on a semi solid medium . Genomic amplification with methotrexate was achieved for heavy chain gene amplification . Biological activity of produced antibody in comparison with Herceptin was tested by flow cytometry method . RESULTS : Three folds of amplification were obtained after seven rounds of methotrexate treatments . The results indicated the equal expression level of heavy and light chains . The yield of purified mAb was between 50 to 60 mg/l /day . According to the results , the produced mAb had similar affinity to P04626 (+) tumor cells to that of Herceptin . CONCLUSION : High-level recombinant protein expression can be achieved by amplification of the recombinant gene with a selectable marker , such as Dihydrofolate Reductase ( P00374 ) . It is usually accepted that P00374 gene can be amplified in P00374 (Ôºç) CHO cells , which consequently leads to amplification of the co-linked target gene , and finally amplification of recombinant protein . In this research , with the aim of producing a biosimilar version of herceptin , the effect of genomic amplification was investigated on the increasing the gene copy number using quantitative real-time PCR .
