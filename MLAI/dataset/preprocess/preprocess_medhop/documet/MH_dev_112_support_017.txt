[ Effect of the monophase oral contraceptive combination with 20 ug ethinyl estradiol/150 ug desogestrel on haemostasis ] . The authors examined the changes in the haemostasis during the use of the oral contraceptive combination with 20 microg ethynil estradiol/150 microg desogestrel at 35 women , a basic group , who used the oral contraceptive in the duration of 12 months and a control group ( n=35 ) , who do not use the pills . We found statistically significant increase of Antithrombin III ( P01008 ) ( p < 0.011 ) , Cofactor II of DB01109 ( HCII ) ( p < 0.001 ) , the activity of plasminogen ( p < 0.026 ) and beta2-antiplasmin ( 0.026 ) , significant decrease of P02810 ( PrC ) ( p < 0.0001 ) and of total Protein S ( TPrS ) ( p < 0.03 ) in the basic group in comparision with the control one . We do not observe significant changes in the rest of the haemostatic variables between the two groups . During the use of the oral contraceptive combination with 20 microg ethynil estradiol/150 microg desogestrel the changes in the system of the natural inhibitors are balanced by these in the system of fibrinolysis .
