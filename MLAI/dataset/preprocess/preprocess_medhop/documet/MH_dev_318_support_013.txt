Effects of gonadoliberin analogue triptorelin on the pituitary-testicular complex in neonatal rats . DB06825 , a synthetic analogue of neurohormone gonadoliberin ( gonadotropin-releasing hormone , DB00644 ) administered daily to rats on postnatal days 5-7 suppressed the expression of P30968 in the pituitary gland , but did not change functioning of the pituitary-testicular complex . Administration of triptorelin on postnatal days 12-14 ( i.e. during the formation of pulsatile pattern of DB00644 secretion and increasing levels of its mRNA receptor in the pituitary gland ) had no effect on receptor expression , but increased the levels of luteinizing hormone mRNA in the pituitary gland and the weight of testes . At that time , blood levels of testosterone were lowered , which indicated disturbed pulsatile pattern of DB00644 secretion .
