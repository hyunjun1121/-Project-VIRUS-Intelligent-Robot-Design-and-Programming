Src and P61073 are involved in the invasiveness of breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to lapatinib . DB01259 is a dual P00533 and ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has significantly improved the clinical outcome of ErbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer patients . However , patients inexorably develop mechanisms of resistance that limit the efficacy of the drug . In order to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in lapatinib-resistant patients , we isolated , from ErbB-2-overexpressing SK-Br-3 breast cancer cells , the SK-Br-3 Lap-R-resistant subclone , which is able to routinely grow in 1 ÂµM lapatinib . Resistant cells have a more aggressive phenotype compared with parental cells , as they show a higher ability to invade through a matrigel-coated membrane . DB01259 -resistant cells have an increased Src kinase activity and persistent levels of activation of P27361 /2 and AKT compared with parental cells . Treatment with the Src inhibitor saracatinib in combination with lapatinib reduces AKT and P27361 /2 phosphorylation and restores the sensitivity of resistant cells to lapatinib . SK-Br-3 Lap-R cells also show levels of expression of P61073 that are higher compared with parental cells and are not affected by Src inhibition . Treatment with saracatinib or a specific P61073 antibody reduces the invasive ability of SK-Br-3 Lap-R cells , with the two drugs showing cooperative effects . Finally , blockade of Src signaling significantly increases P50591 -induced cell death in SK-Br-3 Lap-R cells . Taken together , our results demonstrate that breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to lapatinib have a more aggressive phenotype compared with their parental counterpart , and that Src signaling and P61073 play an important role in this phenomenon , thus representing potential targets for therapeutic intervention in lapatinib-resistant breast cancer patients .
