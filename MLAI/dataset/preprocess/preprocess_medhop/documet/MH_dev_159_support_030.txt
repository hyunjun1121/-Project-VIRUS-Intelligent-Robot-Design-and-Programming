Apigenin up-regulates transgelin and inhibits invasion and migration of colorectal cancer through decreased phosphorylation of AKT . Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world . Apigenin is a flavonoid that possesses various clinically relevant properties such as anti-tumour , anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory activities . Our results showed that apigenin has anti-proliferation , anti-invasion and anti-migration effects in three kinds of colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines , namely SW480 , DLD-1 and LS174T . Proteomic analysis with SW480 indicated that apigenin up-regulated the expression of transgelin ( Q01995 ) in mitochondria to exert its anti-tumour growth and anti-metastasis effects . Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RQ-PCR ) and western blot confirm the up-regulation in all the three colorectal adenocarcinoma cells . An inverse correlation was observed between Q01995 expression and CRC metastasis in tissue microarray staining . Q01995 siRNA increased the viability of SW480 . Apigenin decreased the expression of P14780 in a dose-dependent manner . Transfection of three truncated forms of Q01995 and wild type has identified Q01995 as a repressor of P14780 expression . A synergetic effect was observed in overexpression of Q01995 wild type and apigenin treatment which manifested as lowered phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 and Q06187 Thr308 . In an orthotopic CRC model , apigenin inhibited tumour growth and metastasis to liver and lung . In conclusion , our research provided direct evidence that apigenin inhibited tumour growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo . Apigenin up-regulated Q01995 and hence down-regulated P14780 expression through decreasing phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and in particular Thr308 to prevent cell proliferation and migration .
