An antibody of P01375 did not prevent thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity in rats . P01375 ( P01375 ) -α antibodies have been shown to reduce liver damage in different models . We investigated the effects of infliximab ( a P01375 -α antibody ) on liver damage in thioacetamide ( TAA ) -induced hepatotoxicity in rats . Group 1 ( n = 8 ) was the control group . In group 2 ( n = 8 ) , the TAA group , the rats received 300 mg/kg intraperitoneal ( ip ) TAA daily for 2 days . In group 3 ( n = 8 ) , the TAA + DB00065 ( P27352 ) group , infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ip daily ) was administered 48 hours before the first dose of TAA daily for 2 days and was maintained for 4 consecutive days . In group 4 ( n = 8 ) , the P27352 group , the rats received only ip infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) daily . Livers were excised for histopathological and biochemical tests ( thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances [ TBARS ] , and myeloperoxidase [ P05164 ] ) . Serum ammonia , aspartate transaminase ( Q9NRA2 ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , P01375 -α , liver TBARS and P05164 levels , and liver necrosis and inflammation scores in the TAA group were significantly higher than in the control and P27352 groups ( all p < 0.01 ) . All parameters except Q9NRA2 were not significantly different between TAA and TAA + P27352 . In conclusion , our results suggest that oxidative stress plays an important role in TAA-induced hepatotoxicity , and infliximab does not improve oxidative liver damage .
