Overexpression of SnoN/SkiL , amplified at the 3q26.2 locus , in ovarian cancers : a role in ovarian pathogenesis . High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of 235 serous epithelial ovarian cancers demonstrated a regional increase at 3q26.2 encompassing SnoN/SkiL , a coregulator of SMAD/TGFbeta signaling . SnoN RNA transcripts were elevated in approximately 80 % of advanced stage serous epithelial ovarian cancers . In both immortalized normal ( TIOSE ) and ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( OVCA ) , SnoN RNA levels were increased by TGFbeta stimulation and altered by LY294002 and JNK II inhibitor treatment suggesting that the PI3K and JNK signaling pathways may regulate TGFbeta-induced increases in SnoN RNA . In TIOSE , SnoN protein levels were reduced 15min post TGFbeta-stimulation , likely by proteosome-mediated degradation . In contrast , in OVCA , SnoN levels were elevated 3h post-stimulation potentially as a result of inhibition of the proteosome . To elucidate the role of SnoN in ovarian tumorigenesis , we explored the effects of both increasing and decreasing SnoN levels . In both TIOSE and OVCA , SnoN siRNA decreased cell growth between 20 and 50 % concurrent with increased P38936 levels . In TIOSE , transient expression of SnoN repressed TGFbeta induction of P05121 promoters with little effect on the P38936 promoter or resultant cell growth . In contrast to the effects of transient expression , stable expression of SnoN in TIOSE led to growth arrest through induction of senescence . Collectively , these results implicate SnoN levels in multiple roles during ovarian carcinogenesis : promoting cellular proliferation in ovarian cancer cells and as a positive mediator of cell cycle arrest and senescence in non-transformed ovarian epithelial cells .
