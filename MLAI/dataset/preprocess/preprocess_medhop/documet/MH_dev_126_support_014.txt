Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) antagonizes DB00171 -binding cassette subfamily B member 1 and DB00171 -binding cassette subfamily G member 2-mediated drug resistance . It has been reported that gefitinib , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , has the ability to modulate the function of certain DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) transporters and to reverse ABC subfamily B member 1 ( P08183 ; P-glycoprotein ) - and ABC subfamily G member 2 ( Q9UNQ0 ; breast cancer resistance protein/mitoxantrone resistance protein ) -mediated multidrug resistance ( MDR ) in cancer cells . However , it is unknown whether other P00533 TKIs have effects similar to that of gefitinib . In the present study , we have investigated the interaction of another P00533 TKI , erlotinib , with selected ABC drug transporters . Our findings show that erlotinib significantly potentiated the sensitivity of established P08183 or Q9UNQ0 substrates and increased the accumulation of paclitaxel or mitoxantrone in P08183 - or Q9UNQ0 -overexpressing cells . Furthermore , erlotinib did not significantly alter the sensitivity of non- P08183 or non- Q9UNQ0 substrates in all cells and was unable to reverse MRP1-mediated MDR and had no effect on the parental cells . However , erlotinib remarkably inhibited the transport of E(2)17 beta G and methotrexate by Q9UNQ0 . In addition , the results of ATPase assays show that erlotinib stimulated the ATPase activity of both P08183 and Q9UNQ0 . Interestingly , erlotinib slightly inhibited the photolabeling of P08183 with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ( IAAP ) at high concentration , but it did not inhibit the photolabeling of Q9UNQ0 with IAAP . Overall , we conclude that erlotinib reverses P08183 - and Q9UNQ0 -mediated MDR in cancer cells through direct inhibition of the drug efflux function of P08183 and Q9UNQ0 . These findings may be useful for cancer combinational therapy with erlotinib in the clinic .
