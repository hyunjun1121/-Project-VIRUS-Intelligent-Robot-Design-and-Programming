Physiological and enzymatic properties of the ram epididymal soluble form of germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme . The 94-kDa ram epididymal fluid form of the sperm membrane-derived germinal angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) was purified by chromatography , and some of its enzymatic properties were studied . For the artificial substrate furanacryloyl-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine ( FAPGG ) , the enzyme exhibited a Michaelis constant ( K(m) ) of 0.18 mM and a V(max) of 34 micromoles/ ( min x mg ) and for hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine a K(m) of 2.65 mM and a V(max) of 163 micromoles/ ( min x mg ) under the defined standard conditions ( 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM DB03754 ; pH 7.5 and 8.3 , respectively ) . The FAPGG hydrolysis was decreased by 82.5 % and 67.5 % by DB00974 and dithioerythritol , respectively , and was totally inhibited by specific P12821 inhibitors such as captopril , P- DB00142 - DB00150 -Pro- DB00125 -Pro- DB00142 - DB00167 -Pro-Pro , and lisinopril . Optimum activity for FAPGG was with pH 6.0 , 50 mM chloride , and 500 microM zinc . Under the various conditions tested , bradykinin , angiotensin ( Ang ) I , Ang II , and P01148 were competitors for FAPGG . Bradykinin and angiotensin I were the best competitors . The enzyme cleaved Ang I into Ang II , and the optimal conditions were with pH 7.5 and 300 mM chloride . The relationship between the carboxypeptidase activity in seminal plasma and the prediction of fertility of young rams was also studied . These results indicated a correlation between sperm concentration and P12821 activity in semen but showed no statistically significant correlation between such activity and fertility of the animal . Finally , we tested the role of P12821 in fertilization ; no difference in the in vitro fertilization rate was observed in the presence of 10(-4) M captopril .
