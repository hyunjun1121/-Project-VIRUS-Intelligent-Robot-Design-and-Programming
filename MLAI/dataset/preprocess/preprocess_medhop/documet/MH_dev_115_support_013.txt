Roles of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier caused by lipopolysaccharide . We investigated the involvement of nitric oxide ( NO ) and prostaglandins ( PGs ) in the damage to the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , using fluorescein as a tracer in mice . DB02533 , a competitive inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) , when administered s.c. at 5 mg/kg , but not 500 mg/kg , reduced significantly the increase in brain fluorescein level after its i.v. injection in LPS-treated mice . When 1000 mg/kg of l-arginine , a substrate of NOS , were co-administered with 5 mg/kg of aminoguanidine to LPS-treated mice , the inhibitory effect of aminoguanidine on the increased fluorescein level disappeared . N(G)- DB04223 methyl ester ( l-NAME ) , a non-isoenzyme-selective NOS inhibitor , when administered s.c. at 5 mg/kg , only slightly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the brain fluorescein level . A pretreatment with dexamethasone , which suppressed the induction of both P35228 and cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) , tended to decrease the brain fluorescein level in LPS-treated mice . Indomethacin , a P36551 inhibitor , at 5 mg/kg , but not 10 mg/kg , suppressed significantly the LPS-induced increase in the brain fluorescein level . These results involve that both the NO produced by P35228 and the PGs produced by P36551 contribute to enhance BBB permeability in LPS-administered mice .
