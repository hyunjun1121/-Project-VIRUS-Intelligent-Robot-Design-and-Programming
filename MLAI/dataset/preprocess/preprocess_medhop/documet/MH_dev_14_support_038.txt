Mechanism of purinergic activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : Decreased endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase ( P29474 ) activity and NO production are critical contributors to the endothelial dysfunction and vascular complications observed in many diseases , including diabetes mellitus . Extracellular nucleotides activate P29474 and increase NO generation ; however , the mechanism of this observation is not fully clarified . METHODS AND RESULTS : To elucidate the signaling pathway(s) leading to nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation at DB00133 -1177 , human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with several nucleotides , including DB00171 , UTP , and ADP , in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors . These experiments identified P47900 , P41231 , and possibly P51582 as the purinergic receptors involved in P29474 phosphorylation and demonstrated that this process was adenosine independent . Nucleotide-induced P29474 phosphorylation and activity were inhibited by BAPTA-AM ( an intracellular free calcium chelator ) , rottlerin ( a protein kinase Cdelta inhibitor ) , and protein kinase Cdelta siRNA . In contrast , blockade of AMP-activated protein kinase , calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II , calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase , serine/threonine protein kinase B , protein kinase A , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase did not affect nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : The present study indicates that extracellular nucleotide-mediated P29474 phosphorylation is calcium and protein kinase Cdelta dependent . This newly identified signaling pathway opens new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction .
