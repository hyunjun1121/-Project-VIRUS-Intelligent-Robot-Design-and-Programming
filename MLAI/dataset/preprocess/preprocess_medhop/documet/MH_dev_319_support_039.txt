DB09053 treatment ameliorates murine chronic graft-versus-host disease . Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) is a life-threatening impediment to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , and current therapies do not completely prevent and/or treat cGVHD . P01730 + T cells and B cells mediate cGVHD ; therefore , targeting these populations may inhibit cGVHD pathogenesis . DB09053 is an FDA-approved irreversible inhibitor of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) and P60568 inducible T cell kinase ( Q08881 ) that targets Th2 cells and B cells and produces durable remissions in B cell malignancies with minimal toxicity . Here , we evaluated whether ibrutinib could reverse established cGVHD in 2 complementary murine models , a model interrogating T cell-driven sclerodermatous cGVHD and an alloantibody-driven multiorgan system cGVHD model that induces bronchiolar obliterans ( BO ) . In the T cell-mediated sclerodermatous cGVHD model , ibrutinib treatment delayed progression , improved survival , and ameliorated clinical and pathological manifestations . In the alloantibody-driven cGVHD model , ibrutinib treatment restored pulmonary function and reduced germinal center reactions and tissue immunoglobulin deposition . Animals lacking Q06187 and Q08881 did not develop cGVHD , indicating that these molecules are critical to cGVHD development . Furthermore , ibrutinib treatment reduced activation of T and B cells from patients with active cGVHD . Our data demonstrate that B cells and T cells drive cGVHD and suggest that ibrutinib has potential as a therapeutic agent , warranting consideration for cGVHD clinical trials .
