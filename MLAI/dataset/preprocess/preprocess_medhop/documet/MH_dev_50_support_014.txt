Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase genes P23219 and P35354 - novel modifiers of disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases among Caucasians caused by a mutation in the P13569 gene . However , the clinical outcome of CF pulmonary disease varies remarkably even in patients with the same P13569 genotype . This has led to a search for genetic modifiers located outside the P13569 gene . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of functional variants in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase genes ( P23219 and P35354 ) on the severity of lung disease in CF patients . To the best of our knowledge , it is the first time when analysis of P23219 and P35354 as potential CF modifiers is provided . The study included 94 CF patients homozygous for F508del mutation of P13569 . To compare their clinical condition , several parameters were recorded , e.g. a unique clinical score : disease severity status ( DSS ) . To analyse the effect of non- P13569 genetic polymorphisms on the clinical course of CF patients , the whole coding region of P23219 and selected P35354 polymorphisms were analysed . Statistical analysis of genotype-phenotype associations revealed a relationship between the heterozygosity status of identified polymorphisms and better lung function . These results mainly concern P35354 polymorphisms : -765G > C and 8473T > C . The P23219 and P35354 polymorphisms reducing P36551 protein levels had a positive effect on all analysed clinical parameters . This suggests an important role of these genes as protective modifiers of pulmonary disease in CF patients , due to inhibition of arachidonic acid conversion into prostaglandins , which probably reduces the inflammatory process .
