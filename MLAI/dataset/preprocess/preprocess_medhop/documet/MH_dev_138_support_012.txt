[ Effect of pitavastatin on macrophage cholesterol metabolism ] . OBJECTIVES : DB08860 is the first totally synthetic HMG-Co A reductase inhibitor in Japan that significantly reduces LDL cholesterol while raising HDL cholesterol . Clinical trial showed that pitavastatin has potent effects for LDL cholesterol lowering and is expected effectively to prevent atherosclerosis . To clarify the mechanism of reduction of atherosclerosis by pitavastatin , we examined the effect of pitavastatin on foam cell formation of RAW264.7 macrophages . METHODS & RESULTS : Macrophages were cultured with pitavastatin for 24 h and exposed to oxidized LDL with pitavastatin for 3 days . DB08860 decreased the cellular cholesteryl ester content in a dose-dependent manner , and this effect was not via inhibition of P04035 because the 3-30 nM pitavastatin did not inhibit [14C]cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetic acid and the effect was not influenced by addition of mevalonic acid . DB08860 increased neutral cholesterol esterase ( NCEase ) activity and did not affect ACAT activity , and decreased the expression of P16671 and O95477 mRNA . The mechanism of the increase of NCEase activity was that pitavastatin directly modified the substrate state , which was cholesterol oleate emulsified with lecithin . CONCLUSION : Clinical blood concentrations of pitavastatin prevent foam cell formation of RAW macrophages by oxidized LDL , and this was not via inhibition of P04035 , and modify substrate condition .
