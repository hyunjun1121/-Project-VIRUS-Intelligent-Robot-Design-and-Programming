Enhancement of the P11362 signaling in the P11362 - P08908 heteroreceptor complex in midbrain raphe 5-HT neuron systems . Relevance for neuroplasticity and depression . New findings show existence of P11362 - P08908 heteroreceptor complexes in 5-HT nerve cells of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the rat midbrain and hippocampus . Synergistic receptor-receptor interactions in these receptor complexes indicated their enhancing role in hippocampal plasticity . The existence of P11362 - P08908 heteroreceptor complexes also in midbrain raphe 5-HT nerve cells open up the possibility that antidepressant drugs by increasing extracellular 5-HT levels can cause an activation of the P09038 / P11362 mechanism in these nerve cells as well . Therefore , the agonist modulation of the P11362 - P08908 heteroreceptor complexes and their specific role is now determined in rat medullary raphe RN33B cells and in the caudal midline raphe area of the midbrain rich in 5-HT nerve cells . The combined i.c.v. treatment with P09038 and the P08908 agonist 8-OHDPAT synergistically increased P11362 and P27361 /2 phosphorylation in the raphe midline area of the midbrain and in the RN33B cells . Cotreatment with P09038 and the P08908 agonist induced RN33B cell differentiation as seen from development of an increased number and length of extensions per cell and their increased 5-HT immunoreactivity . These signaling and differentiation events were dependent on the receptor interface since they were blocked by incubation with TMV but not by TMII of the P08908 receptor . Taken together , the P08908 autoreceptors by being part of a P11362 - P08908 heteroreceptor complex in the midbrain raphe 5-HT nerve cells appears to have also a trophic role in the central 5-HT neuron systems besides playing a key role in reducing the firing of these neurons .
