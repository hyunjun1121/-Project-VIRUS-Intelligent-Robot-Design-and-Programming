COXIB currently available in Australasia are celecoxib ( DB00482 ) , rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) and etoricoxib ( Arcoxia ) . This review discusses the pharmacology of these agents and reviews recent literature regarding their effectiveness and safety . It endeavours to answer the question ' Should we be using COXIB in emergency departments in Australasia ' ?
