Laboratory selection of Haemonchus contortus for resistance to ivermectin . The eighth generation of adult Haemonchus contortus , selected by subjecting infected pairs of sheep to suboptimal ivermectin treatment once per generation from parent ( P ; O75936 isolate ) through P08709 ( IV-A ; selected isolate ) , required an approximate 4-fold increase in the ivermectin dose to produce 95 % efficacy compared with its contemporary parent isolate . In a dose titration experiment the dose-response curve of the drug pressure-derived isolate , IV-A , was significantly ( 0.02 less than P less than 0.05 ) less steep than was the response curve of the parent , O75936 , isolate . Potency estimates based upon these nonparallel dose-response curves would not remain constant over a range of efficacy levels but would decrease rapidly at efficacies greater than 95 % . Passage of a closed population of the P00451 generation of IV-A sequentially through pairs of sheep for an additional 11 generations ( P23610 -F8K ) without additional drug pressure being applied produced no reversion to sensitivity to ivermectin relative to the P08709 generation , thus suggesting that the selected " resistance " was stable .
