Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor increases the expression of histamine and histamine receptors in monocytes/macrophages in relation to arteriosclerosis . OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) on histamine metabolism in arteriosclerosis , the expression of histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ; histamine-producing enzyme ) , histamine receptors 1 and 2 ( P35367 and P25021 ) , and GM- P04141 was investigated in human and mouse arteriosclerotic carotid arteries . Furthermore , the molecular mechanisms of GM- P04141 -induced HDC and P35367 expression in monocytic U937 cells were investigated . METHODS AND RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry showed that atherosclerotic human coronary and mouse ligated carotid arteries contained HDC-expressing macrophages . Gene expression of HDC , P35367 , P25021 , and GM- P04141 was also detected in the lesions . In U937 cells , GM- P04141 enhanced histamine secretion and gene expression of HDC and P35367 . A promoter assay showed that GM- P04141 enhanced gene transcription of HDC and P35367 but not P25021 . CONCLUSIONS : The present results indicate that HDC and HHR are expressed in arteriosclerotic lesion , and that GM- P04141 induces HDC and P35367 expression in monocytes . Locally produced histamine might participate in atherogenesis by affecting the expression of atherosclerosis-related genes in monocytes and smooth muscle cells . The presence of histamine-producing macrophages and gene expression of histamine receptors and GM- P04141 was demonstrated in arteriosclerotic lesions . In monocytic U937 cells , GM- P04141 upregulated the expression of histamine and P35367 . Coordinated expression of histamine and its receptors by GM- P04141 would participate in atherogenesis by affecting monocytic and SMC gene expression .
