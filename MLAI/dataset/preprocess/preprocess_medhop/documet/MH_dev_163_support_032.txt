Characterization of a vitamin D receptor knockout mouse as a model of colorectal hyperproliferation and DNA damage . The vitamin D receptor knockout ( P11473 -KO ) mouse presents with a skeletal phenotype typical for complete lack of genomic DB00136 effects . Our previous data from human colorectal tissue suggest that the steroid hormone and its receptor may have protective function against tumour progression . In order to investigate the relevance of the vitamin D system for pre-malignant site-directed changes in the colon , we characterized the amount and site-specific distribution of the P11473 along the large intestine in wild-type ( WT ) , heterozygote ( HT ) and KO mice . We also evaluated expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , of cyclin D1 and the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , a marker of oxidative stress . In colon ascendens , proliferative cells were dispersed all along the crypt and expression levels of all three markers were high in WT mice . A decrease of P11473 expression did not affect expression significantly . In colon descendens , however , fewer proliferative cells were solely located in the lower third of the crypt , and an inverse relationship between P11473 reduction , P12004 positivity and cyclin D1 expression was found in HT and KO mice . In parallel to enhanced proliferation a highly significant increase of 8-OHdG positivity occurred . Therefore , the sigmoid colon of P11473 -KO mice , fed on an appropriate lactose/calcium-enriched diet to alleviate impaired calcium homeostasis-related phenotypic changes , is an excellent model for investigating induction and prevention of pre-malignant changes in one of the hotspots for human colorectal cancer incidence .
