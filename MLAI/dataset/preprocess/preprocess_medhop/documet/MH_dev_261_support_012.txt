Autonomous CaMKII requires further stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin for enhancing synaptic strength . A hallmark feature of Ca(2+)/calmodulin ( P62158 ) -dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) is generation of autonomous ( Ca(2+)-independent ) activity by T286 autophosphorylation . Biochemical studies have shown that " autonomous " CaMKII is ∼5-fold further stimulated by Ca(2+)/ P62158 , but demonstration of a physiological function for such regulation within cells has remained elusive . In this study , CaMKII-induced enhancement of synaptic strength in rat hippocampal neurons required both autonomous activity and further stimulation . Synaptic strength was decreased by CaMKIIα knockdown and rescued by reexpression , but not by mutants impaired for autonomy ( T286A ) or binding to DB01221 -type glutamate receptor subunit 2B ( Q13224 ; formerly Q13224 ; I205K ) . Q8N1N2 rescue was seen with constitutively autonomous mutants ( T286D ) , but only if they could be further stimulated ( additional T305/306A mutation ) , and not with two other mutations that additionally impair Ca(2+)/ P62158 binding . Compared to rescue with wild-type CaMKII , the P62158 -binding-impaired mutants even had reduced synaptic strength . One of these mutants ( T305/306D ) mimicked an inhibitory autophosphorylation of CaMKII , whereas the other one ( Δstim ) abolished P62158 binding without introducing charged residues . Inhibitory T305/306 autophosphorylation also reduced Q13224 binding , but this effect was independent of reduced Ca(2+)/ P62158 binding and was not mimicked by T305/306D mutation . Thus , even autonomous CaMKII activity must be further stimulated by Ca(2+)/ P62158 for enhancement of synaptic strength .
