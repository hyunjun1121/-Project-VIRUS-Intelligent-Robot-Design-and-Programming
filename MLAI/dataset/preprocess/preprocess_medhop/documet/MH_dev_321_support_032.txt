Immunomodulatory role of high-density lipoproteins : impact on immunosenescence . Natural aging is accompanied by a dysregulation of the host immune response that has well-known clinical consequences but poorly defined underlying causes . It has previously been reported that advancing age is associated with an increase in membrane cholesterol level in T cells . The aim of this study was to investigate whether high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) can modulate the age-related accumulation of membrane cholesterol in T cells and impact on their subsequent responsiveness . Our data reveal that cholesterol metabolism , influx , and efflux are altered in T cells with aging , which may in part explain the increase in membrane cholesterol level observed in T cells in elderly individuals . HDL was unable to promote reverse cholesterol transport in T cells from elderly subjects with the same efficiency as was observed in T cells from young subjects besides unchanged ABCA-1 and Q8WTV0 expressions . HDL exhibited a short-acting co-stimulatory effect by enhancing T cell production of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) . Moreover , HDL from healthy normolipemic individuals exerted differential effects on T cell proliferation that depended on the age of the HDL donor . Finally , HDL modulated TCR/ P10747 activation by inducing sustained signaling through pLck , pERK , and pAkt . These data suggest that HDL has immunomodulatory effects on T cells that are influenced by age .
