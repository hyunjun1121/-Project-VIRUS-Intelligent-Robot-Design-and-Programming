Successful use of bisphosphonate and calcimimetic in neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism . Neonatal primary hyperparathyroidism ( NPHT ) is associated with an inactivating homozygous mutation of the calcium sensing receptor ( P41180 ) . The P41180 is expressed most abundantly in the parathyroid glands and the kidney and regulates calcium homeostasis through its ability to modulate parathormone secretion and renal calcium reabsorption . NPHT leads to life threatening hypercalcemia , nephrocalcinosis , bone demineralization , and neurologic disabilities . Surgery is the treatment of choice . While waiting for surgery , bisphosphonates offer a good alternative to deal with hypercalcemia . DB01012 is a class II calcimimetic that increases P41180 affinity for calcium , leading to parathormone suppression and increased calcium renal excretion . At present , there is little evidence as to whether cinacalcet could improve the function of mutant P41180 in NPHT . We report a case of NPHT , treated successfully with bisphosphonates and cinacalcet after surgery failure . To our knowledge , it is the first time cinacalcet has been used for NPHT .
