In utero and lactational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin alters postnatal development of seminal vesicle epithelium . 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) has been shown to alter male reproductive development of laboratory animals through in utero and lactational exposure . As a result of exposure , the accessory glands of the male reproductive tract , including the seminal vesicle , are decreased in size as determined by total weight of the tissue . Analysis of seminal vesicle weights over time suggests that the changes may be transient . Administration of 1.0 microg/kg TCDD during gestation caused a significant decrease in seminal vesicle weights of offspring 8-11 months of age . We examined the effects of TCDD on seminal vesicles from rats exposed in utero and lactationally . Pregnant Long Evans rats were gavaged on gestation day 15 with 1.0 microg/kg TCDD in corn oil . Male pups were euthanized and necropsied on postnatal days ( P01160 ) 15 , 25 , 32 , 49 , 63 , and 120 . Seminal vesicles were weighed and then fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin and processed for microscopic examination . Seminal vesicle weights were not significantly decreased until P01160 32 . P10275 mRNA expression in P01160 25 seminal vesicles was not different from control . In the present study , TCDD exposure decreased seminal vesicle epithelial branching and differentiation . Control epithelial cells had tall columnar morphology with relatively abundant cytoplasm , whereas TCDD-treated cells had rounded nuclei and less cytoplasm . In addition , immunolocalization of proliferating nuclear antigen was confined to undifferentiated basal epithelial cells of controls but was found in both basal and luminal cells of the treated seminal vesicle . Results indicate that the TCDD-induced impaired growth of the rat seminal vesicles is associated with a dramatic decrease in the development of the epithelium .
