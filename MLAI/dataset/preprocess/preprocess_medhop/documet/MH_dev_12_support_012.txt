P01236 exerts a prosurvival effect on human spermatozoa via mechanisms that involve the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and suppression of caspase activation and capacitation . The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of prolactin ( PRL ) on human sperm function , in light of a recent proteomic analysis indicating that these cells express the PRL receptor ( P16471 ) . Immunocytochemical analyses confirmed the presence of P16471 in human spermatozoa and localized this receptor to the postacrosomal region of the sperm head as well as the neck , midpiece , and principal piece of the sperm tail . Nested PCR analysis indicated that these cells possess four splice variants of the P16471 : the long form and three short isoforms , one of which is reported for the first time . A combination of Western blot analyses and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that PRL inhibited sperm capacitation in a dose-dependent manner , suppressing P12931 kinase activation and phosphotyrosine expression , two hallmarks of this process . The suppression of sperm capacitation was accompanied by a powerful prosurvival effect , supporting the prolonged motility of these cells and preventing the formation of spontaneous DNA strand breaks via mechanisms that involved the concomitant suppression of caspase activation . Western blot analyses indicated that the prosurvival effect of PRL on human spermatozoa involved the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation , whereas inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase and Akt negated this effect , as did the direct induction of sperm capacitation with DB02527 analogues . We conclude that PRL is a prosurvival factor for human spermatozoa that prevents these cells from defaulting to an intrinsic apoptotic pathway associated with cell senescence . These findings have implications for preservation of sperm integrity in vivo and in vitro .
