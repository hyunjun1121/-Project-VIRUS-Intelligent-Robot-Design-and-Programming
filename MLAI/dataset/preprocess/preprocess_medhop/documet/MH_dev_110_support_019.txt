Cannabinoids against pain . Efficacy and strategies to reduce psychoactivity : a clinical perspective . The clinical use of cannabinoids is currently a topic of interest not exclusively , but most importantly , concerning different areas of pain therapy . One of the major obstacles in developing clinically acceptable compounds is the cannabimimetic side-effect profile of DB00470 ( THC ) and other cannabinoids . This article gives a brief overview of the endocannabinoid system , its components and functions and explains the current approaches to avoiding cannabimimetic side effects by separating them from the therapeutic effects . One of these approaches is the addition of cannabidiol ( DB09061 ) as well as the use of preparations suitable for oromucosal application . Also cannabinoids , which primarily stimulate peripheral cannabinoid-1 ( P21554 ) receptors or selectively cannabinoid-2 ( CB2 ) receptors , can further separate analgesic activity from cannabimimetic activity . Local or topical modes of application are another attempt aiming in the same direction . Modulating the endogenous cannabinoid tone ( via the inhibition of endocannabinoid-metabolising enzymes ) is another strategy . The combination of THC in low , non-psychoactive doses with opioids has a synergistic effect and reduces opioid tolerance effects . Available data from these approaches are summarised and their more and less promising aspects are discussed .
