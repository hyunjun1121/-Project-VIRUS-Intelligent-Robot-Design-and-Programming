Post- DB00669 era for the treatment of acute migraine . There now is one realized and several attractive targets for the treatment of acute attacks of migraine that will follow and augment the use of serotonin P28222 /1D receptor agonists , the triptans . P01258 gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) receptor blockade recently has been shown to be an effective acute antimigraine strategy ; therefore , blockade of P80511 release by inhibition of trigeminal nerves would seem a logical approach . A number of targets are reviewed in this article including serotonin P30939 and P28221 receptors , adenosine A1 receptors , nociceptin , vanilloid Q8NER1 receptors , and anandamide P21554 receptors . Development of one or more such compound offers the exciting prospect of new non-vasoconstrictor treatments for migraine and cluster headache .
