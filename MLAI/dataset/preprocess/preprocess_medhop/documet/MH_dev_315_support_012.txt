DB00472 induces preventive and complex effects against colon cancer development in epithelial and stromal areas in rats . DB00472 ( FLX ) is a drug commonly used as antidepressant . However , its effects on tumorigenesis remain controversial . Aiming to evaluate the effects of FLX treatment on early malignant changes , we analyzed serotonin ( 5-HT ) metabolism and recognition , aberrant crypt foci ( Q9NQ94 ) , proliferative process , microvessels , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression in colon tissue . Male Wistar rats received a daily FLX-gavage ( 30mgkg(-1) ) and , a single dose of 1,2 dimethylhydrazine ( Q03001 ; i.p. , 125mgkg(-1) ) . After 6 weeks of FLX-treatment , our results revealed that FLX and nor-fluoxetine ( N-FLX ) are present in colon tissue , which was related to significant increase in serotonin ( 5-HT ) levels ( P < 0.05 ) possibly through a blockade in P31645 mRNA ( serotonin reuptake transporter ; P < 0.05 ) resulting in lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) levels ( P < 0.01 ) and , P28335 receptor mRNA expressions . FLX-treatment decreased dysplastic Q9NQ94 development ( P < 0.01 ) and proliferative process ( P < 0.001 ) in epithelia . We observed a significant decrease in the development of malignant microvessels ( P < 0.05 ) , P15692 ( P < 0.001 ) , and P35354 expression ( P < 0.01 ) . These findings suggest that FLX may have oncostatic effects on carcinogenic colon tissue , probably due to its modulatory activity on 5-HT metabolism and/or its ability to reduce colonic malignant events .
