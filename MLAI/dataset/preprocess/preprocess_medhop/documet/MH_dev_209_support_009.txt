Human chromosome 3 and pig chromosome 13 show complete synteny conservation but extensive gene-order differences . A comparative map of human chromosome 3 ( HSA 3 ) and pig chromosome 13 ( SSC 13 ) was constructed using physically assigned pig sequence-tagged sites ( STSs ) . Pig STSs representing 11 HSA 3 genes , including v- P04049 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 ( P04049 ) , retinoic acid beta receptor ( P10826 ) , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , pituitary transcription factor 1 ( P28069 ) , ceruloplasmin ( CP ) , guanine nucleotide binding protein , alpha-inhibiting polypeptide 2 ( P04899 ) , sucrase-isomaltase ( SI ) , rhodopsin ( P08100 ) , dopamine receptor D3 ( P35462 ) , growth-associated protein 43 ( P17677 ) , and somatostatin ( P61278 ) , were developed . Ten pig STSs were regionally mapped using a somatic cell hybrid panel ( SCHP ) to SSC 13 with 80-100 % concordance . Large-insert probes were obtained by screening a pig yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) library with primers for each STS . Several YACs were identified for P35462 , P17677 , P28069 , P08100 , SI , and P61278 for fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) mapping . Single gene and bi-color Q5TCZ1 with each pairwise combination were used to further define the gene order on SSC 13 . While these data confirm chromosome painting results showing that HSA 3 probes hybridize to a major portion of SSC 13 , they also demonstrate extensive gene-order differences between man and pig within this large conserved synteny group . Interestingly , several conserved chromosomal regions have been detected between pig and mouse that are not conserved between man and mouse , suggesting that the SSC 13 gene arrangement may be the closest to that of the ancestral eutherian chromosome .
