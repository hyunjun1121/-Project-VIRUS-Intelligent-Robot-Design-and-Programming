Effects of enhancement and antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine activity on the influence of metoclopramide on gastric emptying . This study examines the influence of the serotonergic system on the effect of metoclopramide on gastric emptying . Six subjects received the following pretreatments before metoclopramide and paracetamol : fluoxetine ( 5-HT uptake inhibitor ) ; meterogoline ( 5-HT1 antagonist ) ; pizotifen ( 5-HT2 antagonist ) or methysergide ( 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist ) . One regimen consisted of metoclopramide ( 5- Q9H205 antagonist and Q13639 agonist ) alone . Gastric emptying was measured by the mean cumulative fraction absorbed-time profiles of paracetamol . Methysergide/metoclopramide significantly delayed gastric emptying from 30 min onwards . DB01233 with either metergoline or pizotifen did not retard gastric emptying to the same extent , suggesting a greater influence with simultaneous 5-HT1 and 5HT2 blockade . DB01233 /fluoxetine caused a significant decrease in the fractional absorption of paracetamol at 5 min when compared to the metoclopramide regimen . It was assumed that the influence of metoclopramide was not optimal at this stage , therefore possibly indicating domination of 5- Q9H205 over Q13639 effects , resulting in gastric delay . It therefore seems as if all the 5-HT receptors present in the gut have a role to play in the control of gastric emptying .
