P62937 is required for efficient human cytomegalovirus DNA replication and reactivation . Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a large DNA virus belonging to the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae . Haematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage have been shown to harbour latent HCMV . However , following terminal differentiation of these cells , virus is reactivated , and in an immunocompromised host acute infection can occur . It is currently unknown which viral and cellular factors are involved in regulating the switch between lytic and latent infections . P62937 ( CyPA ) is a cellular protein that acts as a major factor in virus replication and/or virion maturation for a number of different viruses , including human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis C virus , murine cytomegalovirus , influenza A virus and vaccinia virus . This study investigated the role of CyPA during HCMV infection . CyPA expression was silenced in human foreskin fibroblast ( HF ) and THP-1 cells using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) technology , or the cells were treated with cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) to inhibit CyPA activity . Silencing CyPA in HF cells with siRNA resulted in an overall reduction in virus production characterized by delayed expression of immediate-early ( IE ) proteins , decreased viral DNA loads and reduced titres . Furthermore , silencing of CyPA in THP-1 cells pre- and post-differentiation prevented IE protein expression and virus reactivation from a non-productive state . Interestingly , it was observed that treatment of THP-1 cells with DB00091 prevented the cells from establishing a fully latent infection . In summary , these results demonstrate that CyPA expression is an important factor in HCMV IE protein expression and virus production in lytically infected HF cells , and is a major component in virus reactivation from infected THP-1 cells .
