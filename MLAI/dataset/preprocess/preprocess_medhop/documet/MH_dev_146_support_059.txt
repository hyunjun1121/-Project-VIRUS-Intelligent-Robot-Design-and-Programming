Angiogenic factors reconstitute hematopoiesis by recruiting stem cells from bone marrow microenvironment . The mechanism by which angiogenic factors recruit bone marrow ( BM ) -derived quiescent endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) is not known . Here , we report that functional vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 ( P17948 , Flt-1 ) is expressed on a subpopulation of human P28906 (+) and mouse Lin-Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) BM-repopulating stem cells , conveying signals for recruitment of HSCs and reconstitution of hematopoiesis . Inhibition of P17948 signaling , but not P35968 ( Flk-1 , P35968 ) , blocked P19526 cell cycling , differentiation and hematopoietic recovery after BM suppression , resulting in the demise of the treated mice . Plasma elevation of placental growth factor ( P49763 ) , which signals through P17948 , but not P35968 , restored hematopoiesis during the early and late phases following BM suppression . The mechanism whereby P49763 enhanced early phases of BM recovery was mediated directly through rapid chemotaxis of readily available P17948 (+) BM-repopulating and progenitor cells . The late phase of hematopoietic recovery was driven by P49763 -induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) in the BM , mediating the release of soluble Kit-ligand (sKitL). sKitL increased proliferation and motility of HSCs and progenitor cells , thereby augmenting hematopoietic recovery . P49763 promotes recruitment of P17948 (+) HSCs from a quiescent to a proliferative microenvironment within the BM , favoring differentiation , mobilization , and reconstitution of hematopoiesis .
