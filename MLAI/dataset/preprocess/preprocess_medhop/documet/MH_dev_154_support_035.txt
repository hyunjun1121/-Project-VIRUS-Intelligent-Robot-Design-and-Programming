Targeting of tumor cells by cell surface urokinase plasminogen activator-dependent anthrax toxin . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) binds pro-urokinase plasminogen activator ( pro-uPA ) and thereby localizes it near plasminogen , causing the generation of active uPA and plasmin on the cell surface . Q03405 and uPA are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines , and expression of Q03405 and uPA is highly correlated to tumor invasion and metastasis . To exploit these characteristics in the design of tumor cell-selective cytotoxins , we constructed mutated anthrax toxin-protective antigen ( PrAg ) proteins in which the furin cleavage site is replaced by sequences cleaved specifically by uPA . These uPA-targeted PrAg proteins were activated selectively on the surface of Q03405 -expressing tumor cells in the presence of pro-uPA and plasminogen . The activated PrAg proteins caused internalization of a recombinant cytotoxin , FP59 , consisting of anthrax toxin lethal factor residues 1-254 fused to the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A , thereby killing the Q03405 -expressing tumor cells . The activation and cytotoxicity of these uPA-targeted PrAg proteins were strictly dependent on the integrity of the tumor cell surface-associated plasminogen activation system . We also constructed a mutated PrAg protein that selectively killed tissue plasminogen activator-expressing cells . These mutated PrAg proteins may be useful as new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment .
