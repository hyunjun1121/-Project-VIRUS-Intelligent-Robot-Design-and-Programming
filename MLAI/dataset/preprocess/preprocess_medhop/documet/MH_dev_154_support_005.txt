Confocal fluorescence microscopy of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and cathepsin D in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells migrating in reconstituted basement membrane . Using confocal fluorescence microscopy with a monoclonal antibody , we have localized the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator ( Q03405 ) in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells migrating into a reconstituted basement membrane . Patchy and polarized Q03405 immunoreactivity was found at the cell membrane , and strong staining was found both in the ruffled border or leading edge of the cells and at pseudopodia penetrating into the membrane . Intracellular Q03405 staining was localized in the paranuclear region and in rounded granule-like structures ; some of these were identified as lysosomes by double staining for Q03405 and the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) activity has previously been shown to play a role in migration of cells into basement membranes , and it has been proposed that Q03405 also is involved in this process . uPA is known to be internalized and degraded after complex formation with the inhibitor P05121 . Lysosomal Q03405 immunoreactivity may result from concomitant internalization of the receptor .
