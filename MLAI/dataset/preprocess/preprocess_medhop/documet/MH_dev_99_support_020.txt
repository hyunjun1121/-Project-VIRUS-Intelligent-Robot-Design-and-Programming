DB00188 -resistant myeloma cell lines : a role for mutated P28074 in preventing the accumulation of unfolded proteins and fatal ER stress . DB00188 is an effective agent for treating multiple myeloma ( MM ) . To investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to this agent , we established two bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines , KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ , the 50 % inhibitory concentration values of which were respectively 24.7- and 16.6-fold higher than their parental cell lines . No activation of caspase and BH3-only proteins such as Noxa was noted in bortezomib-resistant cells after exposure to the drug . The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was reduced in bortezomib-resistant cells compared with the parental cells , associated with avoidance of catastrophic ER stress as assessed by downregulation of P35638 expression . These resistant MM cells have a unique point mutation , G322A , in the gene encoding the proteasome beta5 subunit ( P28074 ) , likely resulting in conformational changes to the bortezomib-binding pocket of this subunit . KMS-11 parental cells transfected to express mutated P28074 also showed reduced bortezomib-induced apoptosis compared with those expressing wild-type P28074 or the parental cells . Expression of mutated P28074 was associated with the prevention of the accumulation of unfolded proteins . Thus , a fraction of MM cells may acquire bortezomib resistance by suppressing apoptotic signals through the inhibition of unfolded protein accumulation and subsequent excessive ER stress by a mutation of the P28074 gene .
