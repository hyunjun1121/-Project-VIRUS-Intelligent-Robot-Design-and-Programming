A novel bisphosphonate inhibitor of squalene synthase combined with a statin or a nitrogenous bisphosphonate in vitro . Statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates ( NBP ) inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase ( P04035 ) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( P14324 ) , respectively , leading to depletion of farnesyl diphosphate ( FPP ) and disruption of protein prenylation . P37268 ( P37268 ) utilizes FPP in the first committed step from the mevalonate pathway toward cholesterol biosynthesis . Herein , we have identified novel bisphosphonates as potent and specific inhibitors of P37268 , including the tetrasodium salt of 9-biphenyl-4,8-dimethyl-nona-3,7-dienyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid ( compound 5 ) . Compound 5 reduced cholesterol biosynthesis and lead to a substantial intracellular accumulation of FPP without reducing cell viability in HepG2 cells . At high concentrations , lovastatin and zoledronate impaired protein prenylation and decreased cell viability , which limits their potential use for cholesterol depletion . When combined with lovastatin , compound 5 prevented lovastatin-induced FPP depletion and impairment of protein farnesylation . Compound 5 in combination with the NBP zoledronate completely prevented zoledronate-induced impairment of both protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation . Cotreatment of cells with compound 5 and either lovastatin or zoledronate was able to significantly prevent the reduction of cell viability caused by lovastatin or zoledronate alone . The combination of an P37268 inhibitor with an P04035 or P14324 inhibitor provides a rational approach for reducing cholesterol synthesis while preventing nonsterol isoprenoid depletion .
