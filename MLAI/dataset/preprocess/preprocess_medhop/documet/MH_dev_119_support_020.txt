Cyclooxygenase-independent inhibition of H2O2-induced cell death by S-ketoprofen in renal cells . The stress response of the distal tubule to oxidative attack may be relevant to recovery from acute renal failure . In distal tubular Madin-Darby cells ( MDCK ) , H(2)O(2) induced up-regulation of cyclooxygenases ( P23219 and P35354 ) , prostaglandin-E(2) production and caspase-independent cell death . Cell death was inhibited by S-ketoprofen , but not by the much weaker P36551 inhibitor R-ketoprofen . Interestingly , we identified 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin-J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) , a peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-gamma agonist , as a lethal prostaglandin whose effect was reproduced by the P37231 agonist ciglitazone . Nevertheless , H(2)O(2)-induced cell death was unaffected by other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) or all-trans-retinoic acid . Moreover , c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 prevented 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2)-induced cell death , but not H(2)O(2)-induced cell death . P37231 antagonist GW9662 showed no affect on the cell death . These results indicated that protection by S-ketoprofen was P36551 -independent and PPARgamma independent . Moreover , the IC(50) value of the action of S-ketoprofen for the inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced MDCK cell death ( approximately equal 140microM ) was much higher than the IC(50) value for the inhibition of P23219 and P35354 activities ( approximately equal 1microM ) . Further design of S-ketoprofen derivatives devoid of P36551 inhibitory activity will give opportunity to protect the kidney against oxidative attack while avoiding unwanted effects of NSAID .
