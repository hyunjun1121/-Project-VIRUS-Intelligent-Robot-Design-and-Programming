DNA replication stalling attenuates tyrosine kinase signaling to suppress S phase progression . Here we report that T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase ( P17706 ) -dependent and -independent pathways attenuate the JAK and Src protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and P40763 phosphorylation to suppress cyclin D1 expression and S phase progression in response to DNA replication stress . Cells that lack P17706 fail to suppress P23458 , Src , and P40763 , allowing for sustained cyclin D1 levels and progression through S phase despite continued replication stress . Cells that bypass the checkpoint undergo aberrant mitoses with lagging chromosomes that stain for the DNA damage marker gamma P16104 . Therefore , inactivating JAK , Src , and P40763 signaling pathways in response to DNA replication stress may be essential for the suppression of S phase progression and the maintenance of genomic stability .
