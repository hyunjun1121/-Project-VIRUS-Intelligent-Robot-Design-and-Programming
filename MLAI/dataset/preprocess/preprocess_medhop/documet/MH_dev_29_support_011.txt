A cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway augments activation-induced cytosine deaminase expression within replicating human B cells . Within inflammatory environments , B cells encountering foreign or self-Ag can develop tertiary lymphoid tissue expressing activation-induced cytosine deaminase ( Q9GZX7 ) . Recently , this DNA-modifying enzyme was detected in nonlymphoid cells within several inflamed tissues and strongly implicated in malignant transformation . This study examines whether a cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) pathway , often linked to inflammation , influences Q9GZX7 expression in activated B lymphocytes . In this paper , we report that dividing human B cells responding to surrogate C3d-coated Ag , P05112 , and Q9Y275 express Q9GZX7 , as well as P35354 . A progressive increase in Q9GZX7 with each division was paralleled by a division-related increase in a P35354 -linked enzyme , microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1 , and the PGE(2)R , EP2 . Cells with the greatest expression of Q9GZX7 expressed the highest levels of EP2 . Although P35354 inhibitors diminished both Q9GZX7 expression and IgG class switching , exogenous PGE(2) and butaprost , a selective EP2 agonist , augmented Q9GZX7 mRNA/protein and increased the numbers of IgG(+) progeny . Despite the latter , the proportion of IgG(+) cells within viable progeny generally declined with PGE(2) supplementation . This was not due to PGE(2)-promoted differentiation to plasma cells or to greater downstream switching . Rather , because phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated levels were increased in progeny of PGE(2)-supplemented cultures , it appears more likely that PGE(2) facilitates Q9GZX7 -dependent DNA double-strand breaks that block B cell cycle progression or promote activation-induced cell death , or both . Taken together , the results suggest that a PGE(2) feed-forward mechanism for augmenting P35354 pathway proteins promotes progressively increased levels of Q9GZX7 mRNA , protein , and function .
