DB00227 overcomes gefitinib resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer cells with K-Ras mutations . DB00227 is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitor . Its inhibitory action on P04035 leads to depletion of isoprenoids , which inhibits post-translational modification of DB01367 . In this study , we investigated the effect of combining lovastatin with gefitinib on gefitinib-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines with K-Ras mutations . Antitumor effects were measured by growth inhibition and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay . Effects on apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry , DNA fragmentation , and immunoblots . Protein levels of DB01367 , AKT/pAKT , and RAF/ P27361 /2 in cancer cells were analyzed by immunoblot . Compared with gefitinib alone , a combination of gefitinib with lovastatin showed significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in gefitinib-resistant A549 and NCI-H460 human NSCLC cells . In addition , lovastatin combination treatment significantly increased gefitinib-related apoptosis , as determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis . These effects correlated with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , and Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 . The combination of lovastatin and gefitinib effectively down-regulated DB01367 protein and suppressed the phosphorylation of RAF , P27361 /2 , AKT , and P00533 in both cell lines . Taken together , these results suggest lovastatin can overcome gefitinib resistance , in NSCLC cells with K-Ras mutations , by down regulation of DB01367 protein , which leads to inhibition of both RAF/ P29323 and AKT pathways .
