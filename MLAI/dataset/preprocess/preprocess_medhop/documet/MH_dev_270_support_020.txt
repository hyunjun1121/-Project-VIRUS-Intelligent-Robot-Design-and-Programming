DB01285 releasing factor receptor 1 ( CRF1 ) and CRF2 agonists exert an anti-inflammatory effect during the early phase of inflammation suppressing LPS-induced P01375 release from macrophages via induction of P35354 and DB00917 . P06850 ( CRF ) , the principal regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis , also modulates the inflammatory response directly , via its effect on mast cells and macrophages . On macrophages , it augments production of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines . CRF and its related peptides may also act as anti-inflammatory agents . Aim of the present work was to examine the role of macrophages on the anti-inflammatory effects of CRF-peptides and the mechanism involved . Thus , we examined if CRF receptor 1 ( CRF1 ) and CRF2 agonists exert any anti-inflammatory effect on primary mouse macrophages . We have found that : ( a ) CRF , P55089 ( P55089 )1 and Q96RP3 transiently suppressed the release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( P01375 ) in LPS-activated macrophages , an effect peaking at 4 h . This effect did not involve changes on P01375 transcription . ( b ) CRF peptide-induced suppression of P01375 release depended on induction of P35354 and DB00917 synthesis . ( c ) Use of specific CRF1 and CRF2 antagonists suggested that this effect involved both CRF receptor types . ( d ) The effect of CRF-peptides on P35354 was mediated via PI3K and p38MAPK . ( e ) Longer exposure of macrophages to CRF-peptides resulted in induction of P01375 production via enhancement of its transcription . In conclusion , this is the first report suggesting that CRF1 and CRF2 agonists exert a biphasic effect on macrophages . During the early stages of the inflammatory response , they suppress P01375 release via induction of P35354 / DB00917 while later on they induce P01375 transcription . Hence , the reported anti-inflammatory effect of CRF-peptides appears to involve macrophages and is confined at the early stage of inflammation .
