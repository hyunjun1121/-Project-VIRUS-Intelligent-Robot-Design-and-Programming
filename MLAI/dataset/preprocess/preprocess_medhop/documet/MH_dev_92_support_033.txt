Alterations of the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene O60880 in common variable immunodeficiency syndrome . X-linked lymphoproliferative ( XLP ) disease is a primary immunodeficiency caused by a defect in the O60880 gene . At least 3 major manifestations characterize its clinical presentation : fatal infectious mononucleosis ( Q9UBW7 ) , lymphomas , and immunoglobulin deficiencies . Common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) is a syndrome characterized by immunoglobulin deficiency leading to susceptibility to infection . In some patients with CVID , a defective btk or P29965 gene has been found , but most often there is no clearly identified etiology . Here , 2 unrelated families in whom male members were affected by CVID were examined for a defect in the XLP gene . In one family previously reported in the literature as having progressive immunoglobulin deficiencies , 3 brothers were examined for recurrent respiratory infections , whereas female family members showed only elevated serum immunoglobulin A levels . A grandson of one of the brothers died of a severe Aspergillus infection secondary to progressive immunoglobulin deficiency , Q9UBW7 , aplastic anemia , and B-cell lymphoma . In the second family , 2 brothers had B lymphocytopenia and immunoglobulin deficiencies . X-linked agammaglobulinemia syndrome was excluded genetically , and they were classified as having CVID . The occurrence of Q9UBW7 in a male cousin of the brothers led to the XLP diagnosis . Because the O60880 gene was found altered in both families , these findings indicate that XLP must be considered when more than one male patient with CVID is encountered in the same family , and O60880 must be analyzed in all male patients with CVID . Moreover , these data link defects in the O60880 gene to abnormal B-lymphocyte development and to dysgammaglobulinemia in female members of families with XLP disease .
