DB08860 , a P04035 inhibitor , blocks vascular smooth muscle cell populated-collagen lattice contraction . Constrictive arterial remodeling plays a major role in lumen narrowing following angioplasty . We investigated the effect of pitavastatin , a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- DB01992 ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitor , on vascular smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) -populated collagen lattice contraction , an in vitro model of vascular contraction . Type I collagen gel contraction by SMCs , which are cultured in collagen gel , was used as a model of vascular remodeling . DB08860 pretreatment inhibited 10 % serum- or platelet-derived growth factor-BB ( PDGF ) -induced SMC-mediated collagen lattice contraction in a concentration-dependent manner . The effect of pitavastatin was prevented by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate , but not by squalene , a precursor of cholesterol , or farnesyl pyrophosphate . The serum- or PDGF-induced SMC-mediated collagen gel contraction was inhibited by GGTI-298 , a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor , P01024 exoenzyme , an inhibitor of Rho , or Y27634 , a Rho kinase inhibitor , but not by FTI-277 , a farnesyltransferase inhibitor . Serum or PDGF treatment increased the stress fiber organization in SMCs , which was blocked by the pitavastatin pretreatment . DB08860 had no effect on the serum- and PDGF-induced lamelliopodia extension of SMC . These results may suggest that pitavastatin attenuates SMC-mediated collagen gel contraction probably via an inhibition of geranylgeranylated Rho protein and a disruption of actin cytoskeletal reorganization .
