Pharmacological modulation of dopamine receptor D2-mediated transmission alters the metabolic phenotype of diet induced obese and diet resistant C57Bl6 mice . High fat feeding induces a variety of obese and lean phenotypes in inbred rodents . Compared to Diet Resistant ( DR ) rodents , Diet Induced Obese ( DIO ) rodents are insulin resistant and have a reduced dopamine receptor D2 ( P14416 ) mediated tone . We hypothesized that this differing dopaminergic tone contributes to the distinct metabolic profiles of these animals . C57Bl6 mice were classified as DIO or DR based on their weight gain during 10 weeks of high fat feeding . Subsequently DIO mice were treated with the P14416 agonist bromocriptine and DR mice with the P14416 antagonist haloperidol for 2 weeks . Compared to DR mice , the bodyweight of DIO mice was higher and their insulin sensitivity decreased . DB00502 treatment reduced the voluntary activity and energy expenditure of DR mice and induced insulin resistance in these mice . Conversely , bromocriptine treatment tended to reduce bodyweight and voluntary activity , and reinforce insulin action in DIO mice . These results show that P14416 activation partly redirects high fat diet induced metabolic anomalies in obesity-prone mice . Conversely , blocking P14416 induces an adverse metabolic profile in mice that are inherently resistant to the deleterious effects of high fat food . This suggests that dopaminergic neurotransmission is involved in the control of metabolic phenotype .
