Some antioxidants inhibit , in a co-ordinate fashion , the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , IL-beta , and P05231 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Some antioxidants , including butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , tetrahydropapaveroline ( THP ) , nordihydroguiauretic acid , and 10,11-dihydroxyaporphine ( DB01708 ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of the production of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , P01584 , and P05231 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( IC50s in the low micromolar range ) . Inhibition of cytokine production was gene selective and not due to general effects on protein synthesis . Inhibition of cytokine production by PBMC was observed also when other inducers were used ( staphylococci , silica , zymosan ) . Much higher concentrations of other antioxidants -- including ascorbic acid , trolox , DB00163 , butylated hydroxytoluene , and the P09917 inhibitor zileuton -- did not affect the production of these cytokines . The active compounds did not inhibit IL-1-induced production of P05231 in fibroblasts , showing the cell selectivity of the effect . Antioxidant-mediated inhibition of cytokine production was correlated with low levels of the corresponding messenger RNAs . Nuclear run-on experiments showed that THP inhibited transcription of the P01584 gene . THP decreased the concentration of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 detected in nuclear extracts of PBMC cultured in the presence or absence of LPS . THP and DB01708 markedly decreased the levels of P01375 and P01584 in the circulation of mice following LPS injection . Thus antioxidants vary widely in potency as inhibitors of the activation of transcription factors and of the transcription of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines . Coordinate inhibition of the transcription of genes for inflammatory cytokines could provide a strategy for therapy of diseases with inflammatory pathogenesis and for septic shock .
