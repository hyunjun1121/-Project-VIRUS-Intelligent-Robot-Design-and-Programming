P07550 mediated P29323 activation is regulated by interaction with Q5TCQ9 . The beta-2 adrenergic receptor ( beta2AR ) has a carboxyl terminus motif that can interact with P78352 /discs-large/ Q07157 homology ( PDZ ) domain-containing proteins . In this paper , we identified membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-3 ( Q5TCQ9 ) as a novel binding partner of beta2AR . The carboxyl terminus of beta2AR binds with high affinity to the fifth PDZ domain of Q5TCQ9 , with the last four amino acids ( D-S-L-L ) of the receptor being the key determinants of the interaction . In cells , the association of full-length beta2AR with Q5TCQ9 occurs constitutively and is enhanced by agonist stimulation of the receptor . Our data also demonstrated that beta2AR-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) activation was substantially retarded by Q5TCQ9 expression . These data suggest that Q5TCQ9 regulates beta2AR-mediated P29323 activation through the physical interaction between beta2AR and Q5TCQ9 .
