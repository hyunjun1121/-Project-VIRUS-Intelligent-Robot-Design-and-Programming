Integrative analysis of transcriptomics , proteomics , and metabolomics data of white adipose and liver tissue of high-fat diet and rosiglitazone-treated insulin-resistant mice identified pathway alterations and molecular hubs . The incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes are rapidly increasing and have evolved into a global epidemic . In this study , we analyzed the molecular effects of high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced insulin-resistance on mice in two metabolic target tissues , the white adipose tissue ( WAT ) and the liver . Additionally , we analyzed the effects of drug treatment using the specific PPARÎ³ ligand rosiglitazone . We integrated transcriptome , proteome , and metabolome data sets for a combined holistic view of molecular mechanisms in type 2 diabetes . Using network and pathway analyses , we identified hub proteins such as P21912 and P53597 in WAT and deregulation of major metabolic pathways in the insulin-resistant state , including the TCA cycle , oxidative phosphorylation , and branched chain amino acid metabolism . Rosiglitazone treatment resulted mainly in modulation via Q07869 signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in WAT only . Interestingly , in HFD liver , we could observe a decrease of proteins involved in vitamin B metabolism such as Q6P996 and P00374 and the according metabolites . Furthermore , we could identify sphingosine ( Sph ) and sphingosine 1-phosphate ( SP1 ) as a drug-specific marker pair in the liver . In summary , our data indicate physiological plasticity gained by interconnected molecular pathways to counteract metabolic dysregulation due to high calorie intake and drug treatment .
