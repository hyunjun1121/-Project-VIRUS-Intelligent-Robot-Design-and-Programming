DB08916 prolongs survival compared with gefitinib in an epidermal growth factor receptor-driven lung cancer model . An irreversible ErbB family blocker is expected to inhibit tumors with activating epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) mutations more strongly than reversible P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to overcome acquired resistance to the T790M secondary mutation . Eleven-week-old transgenic mice with Egfr exon 19 deletion mutation were treated with afatinib , gefitinib , or vehicle for 4 weeks . All mice were sacrificed at 15 weeks of age , and the number of superficial left lung tumors with a long axis exceeding 1 mm was counted . The afatinib-treated group had significantly fewer tumors than the vehicle group ( P < 0.01 ) and tended to have fewer tumors than the gefitinib-treated group ( P = 0.06 ) . Pathologically , gefitinib-treated mice had clearer , more nodular tumors than afatinib-treated mice . Immunoblotting showed that afatinib suppressed not only pEGFR but also pHER2 , and induced apoptosis for longer periods than gefitinib . Subsequently , when each drug was administered 5 days per week until death , afatinib significantly enhanced mouse survival compared with gefitinib ( median survival time : 456 days vs. 376.5 days ; log-rank test , P < 0.01 ) . Finally , the combination of afatinib with bevacizumab was found to be superior to either drug alone in exon 19 deletion/T790M and L858R/T790M xenograft tumors . Overall , afatinib was more potent than gefitinib in tumors harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , and the combination of afatinib with bevacizumab efficiently suppressed tumors harboring the T790M secondary mutation .
