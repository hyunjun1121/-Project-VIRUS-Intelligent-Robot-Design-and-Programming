Role of NAD(P)H oxidase in transforming growth factor-beta1-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 expression in rat renal tubular epithelial cells . AIM : This study investigated the role of NAD(P)H oxidase in transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) -induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) expression in rat renal tubular epithelial Q7Z2Y5 -52E cells . METHODS : The cells were treated with 10 ng/mL TGF-beta1 , either in the presence or absence of the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor , diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ) , or short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) suppressing p67phox expression . Expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits , P13500 , and P05231 at the mRNA levels was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , while expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p67phox protein was analyzed by western blot and P13500 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The cellular ROS generation was visualized using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate by confocal microscopy . RESULTS : Compared to control , TGF-beta1 upregulated NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p67phox mRNA by 3.59-fold ( P < 0.01 ) , but had no effect on P13498 , gp91phox and p47phox NAD(P)H subunits . TGF-beta1 was also able to significantly increase intracellular ROS ( P < 0.05 ) , P13500 ( P < 0.01 ) and P05231 ( P < 0.05 ) expression in Q7Z2Y5 -52E cells . Further studies showed that generation of ROS and upregulation of P13500 and P05231 by TGF-beta1 were significantly blocked by addition of DPI or shRNA-p67phox ( P < 0.01 ) , suggesting that these effects were NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent . CONCLUSION : TGF-beta1 differentially regulates the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits and mediates P13500 and P05231 expression in rat renal tubular cells via the NAD(P)H oxidase/p67phox-dependent mechanism .
