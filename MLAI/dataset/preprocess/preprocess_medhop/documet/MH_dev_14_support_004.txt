Effects of a Topical Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and a Selective P35354 Inhibitor on the Prevention of Hypertrophic Scarring in the Skin of a Rabbit Ear . ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitors have been reported to inhibit fibrogenesis , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , to reduce scarring by reducing the initial inflammation . The authors reasoned that the topical application of these 2 agents may have a complementary effect on scar reduction . METHODS : DB01197 ( P12821 inhibitor ) , celecoxib ( P35354 inhibitor ) , or a combination of captopril and celecoxib were topically applied to a skin wound in a rabbit ear , and investigated for the effects on scar formation . RESULTS : The level of scar elevation decreased in the captopril group and the level of infiltration of inflammatory cells decreased in the celecoxib group . In the group where a combination of the 2 drugs was used , the level of scar elevation decreased the most , and collagen deposition and organization returned to normal most rapidly . Celecoxib was found to inhibit the initial inflammation in the ear wound of the rabbit , and captopril inhibited scar elevation . CONCLUSION : Clinical application of these drugs will require further studies with regard to adverse events and their absorptivity as topical agents . However , these findings suggest that the combined topical administration of an P12821 inhibitor and P35354 inhibitor to a skin wound could be an effective treatment for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring. ﻿﻿﻿ .
