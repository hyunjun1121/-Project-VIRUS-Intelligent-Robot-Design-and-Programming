DuOx2 Promoter Regulation by Hormones , Transcriptional Factors and the Coactivator TAZ . The production of H2O2 , which is essential to thyroid hormone synthesis , involves two NADPH oxidases : dual oxidases 1 and 2 ( DuOx1 and DuOx2 ) . A functional study with human DuOx genes and their 5'-flanking regions showed that DuOx1 and -2 promoters are different from thyroid-specific gene promoters . Furthermore , their transcriptional activities are not restricted to thyroid cells . While regulation of Tg ( thyroglobulin ) and P07202 ( thyroperoxidase ) expression have been extensively studied , DuOx2 promoter regulation by hormones and transcriptional factors need to be more explored . Herein we investigated the role of DB00024 , insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( DB01277 ) , as well as the DB02527 effect on DuOx2 promoter ( ptx41 ) activity in transfected rat thyroid cell lines ( PCCL3 ) . We also assessed DuOx2 promoter activity in the presence of transcriptional factors crucial to thyroid development such as Q15669 -1 ( thyroid transcription factor 1 ) , Q06710 , CREB , Q9Y2W7 , Nkx2.5 and the coactivator TAZ in HeLa and P29320 293T-transfected cells . Our results show that DB00024 and forskolin , which increase DB02527 in thyroid cells , stimulated DuOx2 promoter activity . DB01277 led to pronounced stimulation , while insulin induction was not statistically different from DuOx2 promoter basal activity . All transcriptional factors selected for this work and coactivator TAZ , except Q9Y2W7 , stimulated DuOx2 promoter activity . Moreover , Nkx2.5 and TAZ synergistically increased DuOx2 promoter activity . In conclusion , we show that DuOx2 expression is regulated by hormones and transcription factors involved in thyroid organogenesis and carcinogenesis , reinforcing the importance of the control of H2O2 generation in the thyroid .
