DB00013 plasminogen activator amino-terminal peptides inhibit development of the rat ventral prostate . The plasma membrane urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) localizes and enhances activation of pro-uPA . Active uPA , in turn , promotes increased degradation of the extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) by activation of plasminogen . Q03405 binds to Q13201 molecules and integrins , which can affect cellular adhesion , signal transduction , and gene regulation . The current study examines the expression and function of Q03405 in developing rat ventral prostates ( VPs ) . We report that newborn VPs express Q03405 mRNA and protein . In addition , the function of Q03405 -bound uPA during in vitro prostatic development was studied by adding recombinant peptide competitive inhibitors of uPA- Q03405 binding . Newborn VP explants were cultured in serum-free media for one week with 10(-8) M testosterone plus chimeric peptides containing a human immunoglobulin G Fc domain and either human uPA amino acids 1-138 ( hu-uPA 1-138 ) as a control or mouse uPA amino acids 1-138 ( mo-uPA 1-138 ) or 1-48 ( mo-uPA 1-48 ) . Hu-uPA 1-138-treated VPs underwent normal ductal branching morphogenesis and tissue differentiation . In contrast , VPs treated with mo-uPA 1-138 or mo-uPA 1-48 displayed a dose-dependent perturbation of ductal branching . Differentiation of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues was also impaired . Mo-uPA 1-48-treated VPs contained significantly more apoptotic cells . These observations suggest that disruption of uPA binding to Q03405 results in a retardation of the development of newborn VPs .
