Single-prolonged stress induce changes of P62158 /CaMKIIα in the rats of dorsal raphe nucleus . Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα ( CaMKIIα ) is identified as a Ca2+-dependent kinase in brain involved in the activation of DB00150 hydroxylase ( P17752 ) acting through direct phosphorylation of P17752 , and playing key roles in the signaling pathways initiated by various G protein-coupled 5-HT receptors . The goal of this study is to detect whether there are changes of P62158 and CaMKIIα in dorsal raphe nucleus in the rats exposed to single-prolonged stress ( P49903 ) , which is a model employed in post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) study extensively . A total of 90 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal control group and P49903 groups of 7d , 14d . The changes of P62158 /CaMKIIα were detected by immunohistochemistry , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot . Our results demonstrate that both expressions of P62158 and CaMKIIα significantly increase ( P < 0.001 ) in the P49903 7d group than that in the control group , and then decreased dramatically ( P < 0.001 ) 14 days after P49903 . Our results confirm that P49903 induce changes of P62158 /CaMKIIα in the dorsal raphe nucleus . Changes of P62158 /CaMKIIα may be associated with the activation of P08908 receptor , and may contribute to the progress of molecular mechanism of PTSD .
