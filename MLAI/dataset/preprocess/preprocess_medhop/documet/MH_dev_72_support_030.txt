O75791 plays an important role in glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in P01308 -1 cells . OBJECTIVES : The mechanism underlying the regulation of glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis by MAPKs was examined in P01308 -1 cells . METHODS : The rat insulinoma cell line P01308 -1 was cotreated with glucose ( 30 mM ) and palmitic acid ( 0.2 mM ) ( GLU+PA ) . Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology and detection of PARP cleavage . The activation of MAPKs was examined by Western blotting using specific antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of JNK , P27361 /2 , and O75791 . RESULTS : ( 1 ) Live cell imaging studies showed that treatment with GLU+PA for 72 h induced significant cell death , concomitant with P09874 cleavage and caspase-3 activation , which peaked at 96 h of treatment . ( 2 ) Western blot analysis of the activation of MAPKs during GLU+PA-induced P01308 -1 cell apoptosis showed that phosphorylation of O75791 increased gradually and reached a peak at 96 h , which coincided with P09874 cleavage . A transient increase of P29323 activation was followed by a rapid decline at 96 h , whereas JNK phosphorylation status remained unchanged in response to GLU+PA . ( 3 ) Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate ( P41252 ) -2 at 48 h of treatment triggered its degradation , which coincided with O75791 activation . ( 4 ) Inhibition of O75791 , but not JNK or P29323 , blocked GLU+PA-induced P01308 -1 cell apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS : O75791 may be involved in the regulation of glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis through the phosphorylation of Q9Y4H2 .
