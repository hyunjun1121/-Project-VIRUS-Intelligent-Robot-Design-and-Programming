[ Imatinib . DB01268 ] . Imatinib mesilate , which efficiently inhibits P11274 - P00519 ,and P10721 as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGF-R ) kinases , is highly effective for clinical treatment of CML , Ph+ALL , and advanced GIST with good tolerability , respectively . Acquired resistance to the drug,however , becomes an clinically emerging problem with long-standing use . Meanwhile , sunitinib malate,which inhibits three P15692 -Rs and P17948 3 in addition to P10721 as well as PDGF-R , was clinically evaluated in the phase II clinical trials for imatinib-resistant or intolerant GIST , and advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan . DB01268 is therapeutically effective for both on imatinib-resistant GIST and advanced renal cell carcinoma with modest tolerability , and is now under review for approval in Japan .
