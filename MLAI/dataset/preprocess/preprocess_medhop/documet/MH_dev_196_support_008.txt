Apple polyphenol extracts prevent aspirin-induced damage to the rat gastric mucosa . DB00945 causes gastroduodenal ulcers and complications . Food bioactive compounds could exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract . We evaluated whether apple polyphenol extract ( APE ) reduced aspirin-induced injury to the rat gastric mucosa . Rats were treated with APE ( 10(-4) m catechin equivalent ) before oral aspirin ( 200 mg/kg ) . Cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , transforming growth factor-alpha ( TGF alpha ) and heparin-binding epidermal-growth-factor-like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) mRNA and protein expression were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis , respectively ; malondialdehyde ( MDA ) was determined by HPLC ; gastric secretion was evaluated in pylorus-ligated rats . APE decreased acute and chronic aspirin injury both macroscopically and microscopically ( approximately 50 % decrease in lesion score ; P < 0.05 ) . DB00945 up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of P35354 and HB- P01133 , but not of TGF alpha ; APE reduced aspirin-induced mRNA and protein over-expression of P35354 and HB- P01133 ; aspirin significantly increased gastric MDA and this effect was counteracted by APE pre-treatment . APE did not significantly affect gastric acid secretion . In conclusion , APE reduces aspirin-induced gastric injury independently of acid inhibition . We speculate that APE might be of therapeutic use in the prophylaxis of aspirin-related gastropathy .
