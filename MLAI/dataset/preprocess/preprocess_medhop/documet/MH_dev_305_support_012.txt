Human P30939 receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding : correlation with inhibition of guinea pig dural plasma protein extravasation . To determine the potency and efficacy of P30939 receptor ligands , a [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay was developed and optimized for the human P30939 receptor . Compounds which are known to be effective in the abortive treatment of migraine were tested for efficacy and potency in this assay . DB00952 , sumatriptan , zolmitriptan , and rizatriptan all had agonist activity . The P30939 receptor ligand LY334370 ( 4-fluoro-N-[3-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-1H-indol-5-yl]-benzamide ) was the most potent compound tested with an EC50 of 2.13 +/- 0.15 nM . LY302148 ( 5-fluoro-3-[1-[2-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]-1H-ind ole ) , methysergide , LY306258 ( 3-dimethylamino-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazol-6-ol ) , dihydroergotamine ( DHE ) , L-694,247 and CP-122,288 were also investigated for potency and efficacy . There was a statistically significant correlation between the pEC50 for the stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and the pID50 for the inhibition of trigeminal nerve-stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig . In the course of these studies , it was found that the purportedly selective P28221 receptor antagonist GR127935 inhibited P30939 receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding with a Ki of 39.6 +/- 9.5 nM . These studies demonstrate that P30939 receptor-mediated stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a clonal cell system is a reproducible , high throughput assay that is predictive of an in vivo model of P30939 receptor activation .
