DB00072 emtansine : a unique antibody-drug conjugate in development for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor ( P04626 ) -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , composed of trastuzumab , a stable thioether linker , and the potent cytotoxic agent DM1 ( derivative of maytansine ) , in phase III development for P04626 -positive cancer . Extensive analysis of DB05773 in preclinical studies has shown that DB05773 combines the distinct mechanisms of action of both DM1 and trastuzumab , and has antitumor activity in trastuzumab- and lapatinib-refractory experimental models . Clinically , DB05773 has a consistent pharmacokinetics profile and minimal systemic exposure to free DM1 , with no evidence of DM1 accumulation following repeated DB05773 doses . Although a few covariates were shown to affect interindividual variability in DB05773 exposure and clearance in population-pharmacokinetics analyses , the magnitude of their effect on DB05773 exposure was not clinically relevant . Phase I and phase II clinical trials of DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel , and pertuzumab have shown clinical activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Two randomized phase III trials of DB05773 are recruiting patients : EMILIA ( NCT00829166 ) is evaluating DB05773 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine , and MARIANNE ( NCT01120184 ) is evaluating DB05773 plus placebo versus DB05773 plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus a taxane . Additional combinations of DB05773 ( for example , with P16260 -0941 ) and additional disease settings ( early-stage P04626 -positive breast cancer ) are also under investigation . Data from the phase III trials and other studies of DB05773 -containing agents are eagerly awaited .
