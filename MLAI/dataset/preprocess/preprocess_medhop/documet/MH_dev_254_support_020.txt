Acute heat stress induces edema and nitric oxide synthase upregulation and down-regulates mRNA levels of the Q05586 , Q12879 and Q13224 subunits in the rat hippocampus . The influence of heat stress on constitutive isoform of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and DB01221 receptor gene expression in hippocampus was examined in a rat model . Subjection of animals to 4 h heat stress at 38 degrees C resulted in a marked upregulation of P29474 in the hippocampus accompanied with a marked general expansion and edematous cell changes . On the other hand DB01221 receptor messenger RNA encoding Q05586 , Q12879 and Q13224 subunits showed a marked downregulation in the hippocampus of heat stressed rats compared to the controls . Our results show that upregulation of P29474 is instrumental in heat stress associated edema and cell injury . Furthermore , an increased production of NO as evident with upregulation of P29474 appears to be a key factor in the downregulation of DB01221 receptor gene expression in heat stress .
