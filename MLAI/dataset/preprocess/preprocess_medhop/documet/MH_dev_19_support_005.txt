P37268 inhibitors suppress triglyceride biosynthesis through the farnesol pathway in rat hepatocytes . We recently demonstrated that squalene synthase ( P37268 ) inhibitors reduce plasma triglyceride through an P01130 -independent mechanism in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits ( Hiyoshi et al. 2001. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 431 : 345-352 ) . The present study deals with the mechanism of the inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis by the P37268 inhibitors ER-27856 and RPR-107393 in rat primary cultured hepatocytes . DB01076 , an P04035 inhibitor , had no effect on triglyceride biosynthesis , but reversed the inhibitory effect of the P37268 inhibitors . A squalene epoxidase inhibitor , NB-598 , affected neither triglyceride biosynthesis nor its inhibition by ER-27856 and RPR-107393 . The reduction of triglyceride biosynthesis by ER-27856 and RPR-107393 was potentiated by mevalonolactone supplementation . Treatment of hepatocytes with farnesol and its derivatives reduced triglyceride biosynthesis . In addition , we found that ER-27856 and RPR-107393 significantly reduced the incorporation of [1-(14)C]acetic acid into oleic acid , but not the incorporation of [1-(14)C]oleic acid into triglyceride . Though ER-27856 and RPR-107393 increased mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation , the inhibition of beta-oxidation by RS-etomoxir had little effect on their inhibition of triglyceride biosynthesis . These results suggest that P37268 inhibitors reduce triglyceride biosynthesis by suppressing fatty acid biosynthesis via an increase in intracellular farnesol and its derivatives .
