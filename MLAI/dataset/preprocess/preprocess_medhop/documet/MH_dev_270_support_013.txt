Efficacy and safety of the P35354 specific inhibitor valdecoxib in the management of osteoarthritis of the hip : a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled comparison with naproxen . OBJECTIVE : Non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis ( OA ) , but have poor gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability . This study compared the efficacy of the P35354 specific inhibitor valdecoxib with naproxen and placebo , in treating symptomatic OA of the hip . DESIGN : This multicenter , randomized , double-blind 12-week study compared the efficacy and tolerability of single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg with placebo or naproxen 500 mg P55957 . Efficacy was assessed by Patient 's and Physician 's Global Assessment of Arthritis , and the WOMAC ( Western Ontario and McMasters ) OA Individual and Composite Indices . The incidence of adverse events was monitored throughout the study . RESULTS : DB00580 was clinically and statistically superior to placebo for Patient 's and Physician 's Global Assessment of Arthritis and for all WOMAC OA Indices over the 12 week study period ( P < or= 0.05 ) . DB00580 10 mg was similar to naproxen in terms of efficacy , and demonstrated greater numerical improvements compared with valdecoxib 5 mg . DB00580 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated similar tolerability compared to placebo and a lower incidence of GI-related adverse effects compared with naproxen . CONCLUSIONS : Single daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg were similar to naproxen and superior to placebo , in treating symptomatic OA of the hip . Both doses of valdecoxib were well tolerated and demonstrated improved GI tolerability compared to naproxen .
