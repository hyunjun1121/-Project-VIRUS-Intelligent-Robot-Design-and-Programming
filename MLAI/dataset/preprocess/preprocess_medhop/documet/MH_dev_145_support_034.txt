[ Injection site for quick-acting insulin. Significance for glycemic control in basal bolus insulin regimen ] . The impact on glycaemic control of soluble insulin injected either intramuscularly into the thigh ( IMT ) , subcutaneously into the abdominal wall ( SCA ) or subcutaneously into the thigh ( P09683 ) was evaluated in 49 Type 1 diabetic outpatients following a randomised three-month intervention study . P01308 doses were adjusted based on patients ' self-monitored blood glucose values and reported hypoglycaemic episodes . More patients in the SCA and IMT groups than in the P09683 group had serum fructosamine values within normal limits following intervention . Blood glucose at 03.00 was lower in the P09683 group than in the SCA and IMT groups , due to a higher number of low nocturnal blood glucose values ( less than 4 mmol/l ) in the P09683 group . In conclusion , s.c. injection of soluble insulin into the abdominal wall or intramuscularly into the thigh is preferable compared to s.c. injection into the thigh in the basal bolus insulin delivery regimen . Soluble insulin injection s.c. into the thigh during daytime is a risk factor for nocturnal hypoglycaemia .
