Effect of DB00065 on the UVB-Induced Apoptosis of Keratinocytes Infected by HPV38 E6/E7 . The question of the effect of anti- P01375 in skin carcinogenesis is especially relevant in view of the increased use of these drugs for the treatment of autoinflammatory immune diseases . Since ultraviolet radiation and human papillomavirus are involved in skin carcinogenesis , we wished to investigate the effect of P01375 antagonists on the UVB-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes infected by HPV38 . Our results indicate that anti- P01375 agent , infliximab , does not contribute to the survival of HPV38-transduced keratinocytes with UVB-induced DNA damages .
