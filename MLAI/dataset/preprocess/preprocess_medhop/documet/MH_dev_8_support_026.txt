Thirteen type I loci from HSA4q , HSA6p , HSA7q and HSA12q were comparatively Q5TCZ1 -mapped in four river buffalo and sheep chromosomes . Thirteen goat BAC clones containing coding sequences from HSA7 , HSA12q , HSA4 and HSA6p were fluorescence in situ mapped to river buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis , BBU ) and sheep ( Ovis aries , OAR ) R-banded chromosomes . The following type I loci were mapped : P03999 to BBU8q32 and OAR4q32 , P35523 to BBU8q34 and OAR4q34 , P17936 to BBU8q24 and OAR4q27 , KRT to BBU4q21 and OAR 3q21 , P01579 to BBU4q23 and OAR3q23 , IGF1 to BBU4q31 and OAR3q31 , P30968 to BBU7q32 and OAR6q32 , P55157 to BBU7q21 and OAR6q15 , P35913 to BBU7q36 and OAR6q36 , BF to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 , P05305 to BBU2p24 and OAR20q24 , P08263 to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 , OLADRB ( MHC ) to BBU2p22 and OAR20q22 . All mapped loci appeared to be located on homologous chromosomes and chromosome bands in both bovids . Comparison between gene orders in bovid ( BBU and OAR ) and human ( HSA ) chromosomes revealed complex rearrangements , especially between BBU7/OAR6 and HSA4 , as well as between BBU2p/OAR20 and HSA6p .
