DB00193 and another atypical opioid meperidine have exaggerated serotonin syndrome behavioural effects , but decreased analgesic effects , in genetically deficient serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) mice . The serotonin syndrome is a potential side-effect of serotonin-enhancing drugs , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) . We recently reported a genetic mouse model for the serotonin syndrome , as serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) -deficient mice have exaggerated serotonin syndrome behavioural responses to the MAOI tranylcypromine and the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan ( 5-HTP ) . As numerous case reports implicate the atypical opioids tramadol and meperidine in the development of the human serotonin syndrome , we examined tramadol and meperidine as possible causative drugs in the rodent model of the serotonin syndrome in P31645 wild-type ( +/+ ) , heterozygous ( +/- ) and knockout ( -/- ) mice . Comparisons were made with P31645 mice treated with either vehicle or morphine , an opioid not implicated in the serotonin syndrome in humans . Here we show that tramadol and meperidine , but not morphine , induce serotonin syndrome-like behaviours in mice , and we show that this response is exaggerated in mice lacking one or two copies of P31645 . The exaggerated response to tramadol in P31645 -/- mice was blocked by pretreatment with the P08908 antagonist WAY 100635 . Further , we show that morphine- , meperidine- and tramadol-induced analgesia is markedly decreased in P31645 -/- mice . These studies suggest that caution seems warranted in prescribing or not warning patients receiving SSRIs or MAOIs that dangerous side-effects may occur during concurrent use of tramadol and similar agents . These findings suggest that it is conceivable that there might be increased vulnerability in individuals with P31645 polymorphisms that may reduce P31645 by more than 50 % , the level in P31645 +/- mice .
