Interactions between genetic variants of folate metabolism genes and lifestyle affect plasma homocysteine concentrations in the Boston Puerto Rican population . OBJECTIVE : To investigate genetic and lifestyle factors and their interactions on plasma homocysteine ( Hcy ) concentrations in the Boston Puerto Rican population . DESIGN : Cross-sectional study . Plasma concentrations of Hcy , folate , vitamin B12 and pyridoxal phosphate were measured , and genetic polymorphisms were determined . Data on lifestyle factors were collected in interviews . SETTING : A population survey of health and nutritional measures . SUBJECTS : A total of 994 Puerto Rican men and women residing in the Boston metropolitan area . RESULTS : Smoking status was positively associated with plasma Hcy . Genetic polymorphisms P42898 677C→T , Q04609 1561C→T , Q04609 rs647370 and Q96NT5 928A→G interacted significantly with smoking for Hcy . P42898 1298A→C ( P = 0·040 ) and Q96NT5 928A→G ( P = 0·002 ) displayed significant interactions with alcohol intake in determining plasma Hcy . Subjects with Q96NT5 928GG genotype had significantly higher plasma Hcy concentrations compared with carriers of the A allele ( AA+AG ; P = 0·030 ) among non-drinking subjects . When consuming alcohol , GG subjects had lower plasma Hcy levels compared with AA+AG subjects . Physical activity interacted significantly with Q99707 2756A→G in determining plasma Hcy ( P for interaction = 0·002 ) . Smoking interacted with physical activity for plasma Hcy ( P for interaction = 0·023 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Smoking and drinking were associated plasma Hcy concentrations . Genetic variants involved in folate metabolism further modify the effects of lifestyle on plasma Hcy .
