Differential role for phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 in 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate-stimulated MAPK activation , Cox-2 and P10145 expression . Phospholipase D ( PLD ) is expressed in many tissues and stimulated by growth factors and cytokines . However , the role of PLD in signal transduction is still not well-understood . Human embryonic kidney ( P29320 -293 ) cells exhibit low levels of both Q13393 and O14939 mRNA , however , only Q13393 protein was detected by Western blot . When either isoform of PLD was stably expressed in P29320 -293 cells , we observed an increased PLD activity in a cell-free system and a 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate ( TPA ) -stimulated increase in PLD activity in intact cells . This system was then used to elucidate the effects of PLD activity on TPA-stimulated signaling pathways . Two such pathways , the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) , extracellular regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) and p38 are activated by growth factors and cellular stress , respectively . We found that TPA stimulated P29323 phosphorylation regardless of the expression status of PLD . In contrast to P29323 kinase , P29320 -293 cells were unable to induce p38 phosphorylation by TPA stimulation . When P29320 -293 cells expressed either Q13393 or O14939 , we observed elevated p38 phosphorylation in response to TPA stimulation . The P29323 and p38 MAPKs can also stimulate the expression of both cyclooxygenase-2 ( Cox-2 ) and interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) . We used this system to differentiate the effect of Q13393 or O14939 activity on the expression of Cox-2 and P10145 . Increased Cox-2 and P10145 expression was found only in P29320 -293 cells expressing Q13393 . These data identify a novel role for the Q13393 isoform in the induction of gene expression and provide new insight into the differential role of Q13393 and O14939 in cells .
