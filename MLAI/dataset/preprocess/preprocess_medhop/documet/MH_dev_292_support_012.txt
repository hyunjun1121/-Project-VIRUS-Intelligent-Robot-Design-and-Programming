A novel inhibitory mechanism of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate on the activity of Cl- extrusion in osteoclasts . DB09152 -containing bisphosphonates have been well known to be inhibited farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( P14324 ) , an enzyme in mevalonic acid metabolism , resulting in disturbance in polymerization of cytoskeleton structure in bone resorption and promotion of apoptosis in mature osteoclasts . Although bisphosphonates have been reported to activate ion transporters in native epithelium and Xenopus oocytes , little is known whether bisphosphonates affect acid hydrochronic acid extrusion in osteoclasts during bone resorption . The aim of this study was to determine the role of bisphosphonates on inhibition of hydrochronic acid extrusion in osteoclasts . Effects of zoledronic acid , a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate , on the Cl(-) current activated by extracellular acidification were examined in two types of osteoclasts derived from RAW264.7 cells and mouse bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) . Extracellular acidification induced outwardly rectifying Cl(-) currents in mouse osteoclasts . DB00399 dose-dependently inhibited the acid-activated Cl(-) current . The non-nitrogen bisphosphonate etidronic acid had no effect on the acid-activated Cl(-) current . DB00759 -induced P14324 silencing caused a significant decrease in the Cl(-) current . The inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase suppressed the Cl(-) current . By contrast , the inhibitory action of zoledronic acid was rescued by addition of geranylgeranyl acid , a derivative of mevalonic acid . The activity of acid-activated Cl(-) currents was dependent on expression of P51798 during osteoclastogenesis . These results suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates suppress the activity of osteoclastic acid-activated Cl(-) currents through P14324 inhibition , suggesting the inhibition of Cl(-) extrusion activity .
