P10721 -D816 mutations in Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML are associated with impaired event-free and overall survival . Mutations in codon D816 of the P10721 gene represent a recurrent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . To clarify the biologic implication of activation loop mutations of the P10721 gene , 1940 randomly selected AML patients were analyzed . In total , 33 ( 1.7 % ) of 1940 patients were positive for D816 mutations . Of these 33 patients , 8 ( 24.2 % ) had a t(8;21) , which was significantly higher compared with the subgroup without D816 mutations . Analyses of genetic subgroups showed that P10721 -D816 mutations were associated with t(8;21)/ Q01196 - Q06455 and other rare Q01196 translocations . In contrast , other activating mutations like P36888 and P01111 mutations were very rarely detected in Q01196 -rearranged leukemia . P10721 mutations had an independent negative impact on overall ( median 304 vs 1836 days ; P = .006 ) and event-free survival ( median 244 vs 744 days ; P = .003 ) in patients with t(8;21) but not in patients with a normal karyotype . The P10721 -D816V receptor expressed in Ba/ P13726 cells was resistant to growth inhibition by the selective PTK inhibitors imatinib and SU5614 but fully sensitive to PKC412 . Our findings clearly indicate that activating mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with distinct genetic subtypes in AML . The P10721 -D816 mutations confer a poor prognosis to Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML and should therefore be included in the diagnostic workup . Patients with P10721 -D816-positive/ Q01196 - Q06455 -positive AML might benefit from early intensification of treatment or combination of conventional chemotherapy with P10721 PTK inhibitors .
