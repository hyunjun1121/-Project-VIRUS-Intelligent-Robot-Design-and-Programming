Oncogenic events associated with endometrial and ovarian cancers are rare in endometriosis . Endometriosis displays some features that resemble malignant processes , including invasive growth , resistance to apoptosis and distant implantation . The objective of this study was to investigate whether gene alterations that are frequent in endometrial and/or ovarian cancers contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis . Biopsies were obtained from ectopic endometriosis lesions from 23 patients with revised American Fertility Score stage 1 ( n= 1 ) , 2 ( n= 10 ) , 3 ( n= 11 ) or 4 ( n= 1 ) endometriosis . Six genes ( P25054 , CDKN2A , Q9ULZ3 , P10826 , Q9NS23 and P03372 ) were analyzed for promoter hypermethylation using methylation-specific melting curve analysis , and 9 genes ( P15056 , P01112 , P01111 , P35222 , P11802 , P22607 , P42336 , P04637 and P60484 ) were analyzed for mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing . An oncogenic mutation in P01116 ( c.34G > T ; p.G12C ) was detected in a single lesion . No gene alterations were found in the remaining samples . Our data suggest that genetic and epigenetic events contributing to endometrial and ovarian cancers are rare in endometriosis . However , other proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes should be tested for alterations in order to identify the molecular basis of the susceptibility of endometriosis to malignant transformation .
