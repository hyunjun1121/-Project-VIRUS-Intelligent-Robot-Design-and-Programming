Serotonin and fluoxetine receptors are expressed in enamel organs and LS8 cells and modulate gene expression in LS8 cells . The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine is widely used in the treatment of depression in children and fertile women , but its effect on developing tissues has been sparsely investigated . The aim of this study was to investigate if enamel organs and ameloblast-derived cells express serotonin receptors that are affected by peripherally circulating serotonin or fluoxetine . Using RT-PCR and western blot analysis we found that enamel organs from 3-d-old mice and ameloblast-like cells ( LS8 cells ) express functional serotonin receptors , the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis ( Thp1 ) , as well as the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) , indicating that enamel organs and ameloblasts are able to respond to serotonin and regulate serotonin availability . DB00472 and serotonin enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cell culture medium from cultured LS8 cells , whereas the expression of enamelin ( Enam ) , amelogenin ( Amel ) , and matrix metalloproteinase-20 ( O60882 ) were all significantly down-regulated . The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( P13500 ) , and interferon-inducible protein 10 ( P02778 ) was also reduced compared with controls . In conclusion , enamel organs and ameloblast-like cells express functional serotonin receptors . Reduced transcription of enamel proteins and secretion of vascular factors may indicate possible adverse effects of fluoxetine on amelogenesis .
