Genetics and irritable bowel syndrome : from genomics to intermediate phenotype and pharmacogenetics . PURPOSE : Familial aggregation and sibling pair studies suggest there is a genetic contribution to the development of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . The aim of this study was to review the evidence of genetics in IBS based on genetic epidemiology , studies of association with intermediate phenotypes and pharmacogenetics . RESULTS : Genetic association studies with IBS symptom phenotype have generally provided inconsistent results for many candidate genes investigated , such as P31645 , P16520 , and P22301 . There have been no genome-wide association studies in IBS to date . Studies of associations of candidate genes with intermediate phenotypes suggest associations with pathophysiological mechanisms of motor and sensory functions ; however , these results also require replication . Pharmacogenetics studies illustrate the potential of genetics to impact on response to therapy , as observed with P31645 and responses to the 5- Q9H205 antagonist alosetron and the Q13639 agonist , tegaserod . CONCLUSIONS : While the heritable component and genetics in the complex disorder of IBS are still poorly understood , studies of the associations of spontaneous genetic variations and altered functions may provide novel insights of the mechanisms contributing to the disease .
