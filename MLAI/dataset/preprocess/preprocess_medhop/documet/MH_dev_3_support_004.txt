Expression of cellular retinol-binding protein and lecithin-retinol acyltransferase in developing rat testis . DB00162 deficiency in mammals results in the loss of germ cells on the adluminal side of the blood-testis barrier , suggesting a need for vitamin A that would be supplied by the surrounding Sertoli cells . P09455 ( P09455 ) and lecithin-retinol acyltransferase ( O95237 ) are two proteins found in Sertoli cells that are known to be involved in vitamin A trafficking . To clarify the role of these two proteins in the delivery of vitamin A to developing germ cells , we have examined changes in their cell-specific expression during the onset of puberty in the rat . In adult rats , Sertoli cell expression of P09455 varies with the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium . Here , we demonstrate that differences in the intensity of P09455 immunoreactivity are detectable in Sertoli cells of different tubules as early as postnatal Day 4 , prior to the onset of meiosis . This indicates that variable expression of P09455 by Sertoli cells is established independently of late germ cells and may anticipate the cyclical variation seen in the adult . We further demonstrate that the specific activity of O95237 in rat testis increases tenfold between postnatal Days 20 and 35 . This increase is attributable to the appearance of post-meiotic germ cells : the O95237 activity of microsomes prepared from a round spermatid-enriched cell fraction from post-pubertal rat testis could account for the majority of the O95237 activity observed in the whole testis . The presence of O95237 activity within adluminal germ cells suggests that they receive vitamin A as retinol and synthesize the retinyl esters that have been shown to be present in mature sperm .
