Revealing multi-binding sites for taspine to P35968 by cell membrane chromatography zonal elution . A new high-expression vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 ) cell membrane chromatography ( CMC ) method was developed to investigate the affinity of ligands for P35968 . An HEK293 P35968 /CMC system was applied to specifically recognize ligands acting on P35968 . DB00398 was used as a mobile phase additive to evaluate the effect of the marker 's concentration on the retention of sorafenib and taspine , respectively . The relationship among the retention , the types of binding sites and the affinity of taspine binding to P35968 has also been concerned . The retention behavior indicated that sorafenib had two major binding regions on P35968 , and that taspine might act as a multi-target P35968 inhibitor with similar biological activity to sorafenib . The equilibrium dissociation constants ( K(D) ) obtained from the model are ( 5.25 ± 0.31 ) × 10⁻⁷ and ( 9.88 ± 0.54 ) × 10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ for sorafenib at the high- and low-affinity sites , respectively , and the corresponding values for taspine are ( 3.88 ± 0.31 ) × 10⁻⁶ and ( 7.04 ± 0.49 ) ×10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ . The two types of binding sites contributed about a 1:2 ratio on the retention of taspine .
