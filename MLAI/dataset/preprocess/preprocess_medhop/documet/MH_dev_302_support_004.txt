Alterations in receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone , serotonin , and acetylcholine in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . We utilized quantitative autoradiography to examine thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( TRH ) receptors , serotonin type 1A ( P08908 ) receptors , muscarinic cholinergic receptors , choline uptake sites , beta-adrenergic receptors , and norepinephrine uptake sites in discrete laminae of spinal cord from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) and non-neurologic controls . We found decreases of over 50 % in the concentration of TRH receptors in lamina IX of cervical , thoracic , and lumbar spinal cord from P35858 patients . Similar reductions were noted in concentrations of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in lamina IX of spinal cords from P35858 patients . Significant increases of up to 140 % in P08908 receptor densities were noted in lamina IX of spinal cords from P35858 patients . No differences were noted between the concentrations of beta-adrenergic receptors or norepinephrine uptake sites in patients with P35858 and controls . These findings suggest that TRH and 5-HT may be involved in the pathophysiology of P35858 , and act in a comodulatory role in the normal spinal cord .
