Exposure to resveratrol triggers pharmacological correction of fatty acid utilization in human fatty acid oxidation-deficient fibroblasts . DB00583 palmitoyl transferase 2 ( P23786 ) and very-long-chain Acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenase ( P49748 ) deficiencies are among the most common inborn mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation ( FAO ) disorders . Despite advances in their clinical and molecular characterizations , few therapeutic approaches exist for these diseases . DB02709 ( RSV ) is a natural polyphenol extensively studied for its potential health benefits . Indeed , it is presently thought that RSV could delay the onset of some cancers , and have protective effects against common aging disorders such as type II diabetes , cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases . Here , we show that exposure to RSV induces a dose- and time-dependant increase in FAO flux in human fibroblasts , and can restore normal FAO capacities in a panel of patients ' fibroblasts with the mild forms ( harboring various genotypes ) of P23786 or P49748 deficiency . The correction of FAO flux correlated with a marked increase in mutant P23786 or P49748 protein level , in cells treated by RSV . Inhibition of sirtuin 1 ( Q96EB6 ) by Sirtinol and the use of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1-alpha ( P20142 -1α ) small interfering RNAs demonstrate that the RSV-induced stimulation of FAO requires the presence of P20142 -1α and Q96EB6 . These results show , for the first time , that RSV markedly induces mitochondrial FAO capacities in human fibroblasts , and provides the initial proof-of-concept that RSV might be efficient for correction of inherited FAO disorders .
