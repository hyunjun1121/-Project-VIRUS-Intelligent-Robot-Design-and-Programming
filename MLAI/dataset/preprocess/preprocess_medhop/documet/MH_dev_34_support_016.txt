DB00640 regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator through prostenoids in airway epithelia . Cystic fibrosis is caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) protein , leading to altered ion transport , chronic infection , and excessive inflammation . Here we investigated regulation of P13569 in airway cell monolayers by adenosine , adenosine receptors , and arachidonic acid . Our studies demonstrate that the A2B adenosine receptor is expressed at high levels relative to the other adenosine receptor subtypes , with a characteristic low-affinity profile for adenosine-stimulated P13569 Cl- currents in both Calu-3 cells and CFBE41o- airway cell monolayers stably transduced with wild-type P13569 . The levels of adenosine found in sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis with moderate to severe lung disease stimulated apical prostaglandin release in Calu-3 and CFBE41o- cells , implicating adenosine regulation of phospholipase A2 ( P04054 ) activity . A2B adenosine receptor and arachidonic acid stimulation produced P13569 -dependent currents in airway monolayers and increased DB02527 levels that were sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibition . Arachidonic acid demonstrated dual regulation of P13569 , stimulating P13569 and Cl- currents in intact airway monolayers , and potently inhibiting PKA-activated Cl- currents in excised membrane patches . Cl- currents produced by arachidonic acid were sensitive to inhibition of PKA , cyclooxygenase , and P09917 . Together , the results provide a converging mechanism to link regulation of P13569 and airway cell inflammation through adenosine and adenosine receptors .
