Growth factors expression in patients with erosive esophagitis . Although the pathogenesis and treatment of erosive esophagitis ( EE ) is well recognized , little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mucosal healing in EE patients . In this pilot study , we enrolled typical EE patients to evaluate what kinds of growth factors and their receptors were activated in their injured esophageal mucosa . Forty endoscopically proved EE patients were consecutively enrolled . Messenger RNA expressions , which includes keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) and its receptor ( P21802 ) , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) and its receptor ( HGFR ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Data were compared between the injured EE mucosa and their normal esophageal mucosa above EE . The mRNA expressions of P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and P35354 , but not P00533 , KGF , P21802 , P09038 , and P23219 , were significantly increased in the injured mucosa of EE patients compared with those of normal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) . The study found that P14210 , HGFR , P01133 , P15692 , and , P35354 are activated in the injured mucosa of EE patients ; their activation might be involved in mucosal repair and ulcer healing of EE .
