P12004 D-cdk4 activity modulates the subnuclear localization and interaction of Q02078 with P12931 -family coactivators during skeletal muscle differentiation . Prior work has indicated that D-type cyclin-cdk4 complexes , which are only active in proliferating cells , can suppress the skeletal muscle differentiation program in proliferating myoblasts . In this study , we show that cyclin D-cdk activity can block the activity of the Q02078 family of transcriptional regulators , which are crucial regulators of skeletal muscle gene expression . We have found that cyclin D-cdk activity blocks the association of Q06413 with the coactivator protein Q9Y3R0 and thereby inhibits the activity of Q02078 . During skeletal muscle differentiation , Q9Y3R0 is localized to punctate nuclear structures and can apparently tether Q02078 to such structures . Cotransfection of Q9Y3R0 can both potentiate the transcriptional activity of a Gal4- Q06413 construct and induce Q06413 localization to punctate nuclear structures . Consistent with the absence of punctate nuclear Q9Y3R0 in proliferating myoblasts , we have found that ectopic cyclin D-cdk4 expression disrupts the localization of both Q9Y3R0 and Q06413 to these punctate subnuclear structures . Our findings indicate that cyclin D-cdk4 activity represses skeletal muscle differentiation in proliferating cells by blocking the association of Q02078 with the coactivator Q9Y3R0 and concomitantly disrupts the association of these factors with punctate nuclear subdomains within the cell .
