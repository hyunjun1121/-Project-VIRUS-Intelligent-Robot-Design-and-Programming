Effect of postponed treatment with an anti-tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) F(ab')2 fragment on endotoxin-induced cytokine and neutrophil responses in chimpanzees . P01375 is considered to be an intermediate factor in endotoxin-induced release of other cytokines and endotoxin-induced neutrophil degranulation . Little is known about the effect of postponed treatment with anti- P01375 in primate endotoxin models . To assess the effect of delayed treatment with anti- P01375 in endotoxaemia , six healthy adult chimpanzees were intravenously injected with Escherichia coli endotoxin ( 4 ng/kg ) . In three of these animals the administration of endotoxin was followed after 30 min by a bolus i.v. injection of the anti- P01375 F(ab')2 fragment DB04956 ( 0.1 mg/kg ) . Post-treatment with DB04956 completely prevented the appearance of P01375 activity in serum elicited by endotoxin , and markedly reduced the rises in the serum concentrations of P05231 and P10145 . In addition , the endotoxin-induced increases in the type I and type II soluble P01375 receptors were also profoundly inhibited by DB04956 , suggesting that P01375 is involved in the release of its own soluble receptors in endotoxaemia . Neutrophilic leucocytosis was not affected by DB04956 . In contrast , DB04956 did significantly abrogate neutrophil degranulation , as measured by the plasma concentrations of lactoferrin . These results indicate that treatment with anti- P01375 30 min after the administration of endotoxin is still effective in attenuating the induction of the cytokine network and of neutrophil degranulation .
