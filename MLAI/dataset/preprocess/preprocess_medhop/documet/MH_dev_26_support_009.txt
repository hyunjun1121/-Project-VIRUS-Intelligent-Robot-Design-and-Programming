Q9NZQ7 expression on non-B and non-T cells promotes distinct effects on T- and B-cell responses in autoimmune arthritis . The immune system has developed several regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis of adaptive immune responses . T-cell programmed death ( PD ) -1 recognition of Q9NZQ7 ( Q9NZQ7 ) expressed on P25054 and non-lymphoid tissue regulates T-cell activation . We show that Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice exhibit exacerbated proteoglycan ( PG ) -induced arthritis and increased Th-1 P01730 (+) T-cell responses . Unexpectedly , the PG-specific antibody response in Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice was diminished . A reduction in the number of peanut agglutinin(+) GC coincided with a decrease in P15391 (+) GL-7(+) CD95(+) GC B cells that was a result of increased caspase-induced apoptosis . The percent of P28907 (+) CD138(+) emerging plasma cells was decreased . Q9NZQ7 (-/-) mice exhibited an increased frequency of P01730 (+) P18621 (hi) P32302 (hi) Q9Y6W8 (hi) CD62L(lo) T follicular helper cells that displayed a hyperactive phenotype with increased expression of mRNA transcripts for Bcl6 , Q9HBE4 , and the apoptosis-inducer molecule P48023 . In cell transfer of Q9NZQ7 (-/-) cells into SCID mice , non-B and non-T cells were sufficient to normalize the antibody response , T-cell hyperactivity , and the development of PG-induced arthritis . These findings indicate that Q9NZQ7 on non-B and non-T cells signals through P18621 on T effector cells to prevent excessive activation and reduce autoimmune arthritis . Furthermore , these findings demonstrate a novel role for Q9NZQ7 expression in promoting B-cell survival by regulating the activation of T follicular helper cell .
