DB01285 -releasing hormone inhibits insulin-like growth factor-I release from primary cultures of rat granulosa cells . DB01285 -releasing hormone ( P06850 ) , a neuropeptide which modulates gonadal function during stress , is expressed by several cell types of the rat ovary and is able to suppress oestrogen release from rat granulosa cells . The mechanism of this effect is , however , not known . Since insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I is produced by rat granulosa cells and exerts a synergistic role with DB00094 on granulosa cell steroidogenesis , we hypothesised that P06850 may suppress oestrogen release from granulosa cells by inhibiting P05019 release and/or stimulating the release of its binding protein ( P17936 ) . To test this hypothesis , granulosa cells were obtained from immature female Sprague-Dawley rats primed with diethylstilboestrol , and hormone concentrations were measured in the conditioned medium by radioimmunoassay . P06850 suppressed oestrogen and P05019 release stimulated by DB00094 used at a concentration of 1 IU/l , whereas it did not have any statistically significant effect on oestrogen and P05019 release in basal conditions or in response to 5 IU/l DB00094 . The suppressive effects of P06850 on oestrogen and P05019 release were antagonised by a selective P06850 receptor antagonist . P06850 had no effects on P17936 release . P06850 did not have any effect on oestrogen release stimulated by increasing concentrations of P05019 and its suppressive effect on DB00094 -stimulated oestrogen release was overcome by the addition of low doses of exogenous P05019 . In conclusion , P06850 suppressed the release of oestrogen and P05019 , but not of P17936 . Thus , the inhibitory effects of P06850 on oestrogen release could be mediated , partly , by a suppression of the autocrine/paracrine action of P05019 .
