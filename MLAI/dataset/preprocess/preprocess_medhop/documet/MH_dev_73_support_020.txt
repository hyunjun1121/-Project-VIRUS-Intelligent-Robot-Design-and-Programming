Some cannabinoid receptor ligands and their distomers are direct-acting openers of Q09428 K( DB00171 ) channels . Here , we examined the chronic effects of two cannabinoid receptor-1 ( P21554 ) inverse agonists , rimonabant and ibipinabant , in hyperinsulinemic Zucker rats to determine their chronic effects on insulinemia . DB06155 and ibipinabant ( 10 mg·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ ) elicited body weight-independent improvements in insulinemia and glycemia during 10 wk of chronic treatment . To elucidate the mechanism of insulin lowering , acute in vivo and in vitro studies were then performed . Surprisingly , chronic treatment was not required for insulin lowering . In acute in vivo and in vitro studies , the P21554 inverse agonists exhibited acute K channel opener ( KCO ; e.g. , diazoxide and NN414 ) -like effects on glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) with approximately fivefold better potency than diazoxide . Followup studies implied that these effects were inconsistent with a P21554 -mediated mechanism . Thus effects of several P21554 agonists , inverse agonists , and distomers during GTTs or GSIS studies using perifused rat islets were unpredictable from their known P21554 activities . In vivo rimonabant and ibipinabant caused glucose intolerance in P21554 but not Q09428 -KO mice . Electrophysiological studies indicated that , compared with diazoxide , 3 μM rimonabant and ibipinabant are partial agonists for K channel opening . Partial agonism was consistent with data from radioligand binding assays designed to detect Q09428 K( DB00171 ) KCOs where rimonabant and ibipinabant allosterically regulated ³H-glibenclamide-specific binding in the presence of MgATP , as did diazoxide and NN414 . Our findings indicate that some P21554 ligands may directly bind and allosterically regulate Kir6.2/ Q09428 K( DB00171 ) channels like other KCOs . This mechanism appears to be compatible with and may contribute to their acute and chronic effects on GSIS and insulinemia .
