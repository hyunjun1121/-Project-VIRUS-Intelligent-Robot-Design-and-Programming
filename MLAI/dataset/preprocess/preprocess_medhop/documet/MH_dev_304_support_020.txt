Calcineurin enhances acetylcholinesterase mRNA stability during P06681 -C12 muscle cell differentiation . Treatment of P06681 -C12 mouse myoblasts with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) enhances the increase in acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) expression observed during skeletal muscle differentiation . The enhanced P22303 expression is due primarily to increased mRNA stability because DB00091 treatment increases the half-life of P22303 mRNA , but not the apparent transcriptional rate of the gene . Neither tacrolimus ( FK506 ) , an immunosuppressive agent with a distinct structure , nor cyclosporine H , an inactive congener of DB00091 , alters P22303 expression . The enhanced P22303 expression is associated with the muscle differentiation process , but can not be triggered by DB00091 exposure before differentiation . Myoblasts and myotubes of P06681 -C12 cells express similar amounts of cyclophilin A and P62942 , immunophilins known to be intracellular-binding targets for DB00091 and tacrolimus , respectively . However , cellular levels of calcineurin , a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase known to be the cellular target of ligand-immunophilin complexes , increase 3-fold during myogenesis . Overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin in differentiating cells reduces P22303 mRNA levels and DB00091 antagonizes such an inhibition . Conversely , overexpression of a dominant negative calcineurin construct increases P22303 mRNA levels , which are further enhanced by DB00091 . Thus , a DB00091 sensitive , calcineurin mediated pathway appears linked to differentiation-induced stabilization of P22303 mRNA during myogenesis .
