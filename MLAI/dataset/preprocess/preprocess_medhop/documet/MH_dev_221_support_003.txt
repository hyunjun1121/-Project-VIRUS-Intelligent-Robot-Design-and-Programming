Activity of retinoic acid receptor-gamma selectively binding retinoids alone and in combination with interferon-gamma in breast cancer cell lines . Retinoids modulate several cell functions and especially inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cells including breast cancer . Retinoic acid receptor-gamma ( P13631 ) has been shown to mediate the antiproliferative activity of retinoids . To further test this hypothesis we examined the effects of different P13631 selectively binding retinoids ( CD2325 , CD2247 , CD666 and CD437 ) on breast cancer cell lines . With exception of CD2247 , all retinoids inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 , SKBR-3 , T47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines , similar to the natural compound all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . In addition , all 4 compounds were able to act synergistically with interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) in all breast cancer cell lines including the retinoid-resistant BT-20 and 734-B lines . In functional transactivation assays we demonstrated that only in the MCF-7 cell line , TPA-mediated AP-1 activity was suppressed only by DB00755 and CD2325 , whereas in SKBR-3 , another RA-sensitive breast cancer cell line , it was not . The synergistic antiproliferative activity involving retinoids and P01579 could not be explained by an enhanced anti-AP-1 activity . No correlation was found between expression of RARs and cellular retinoic acid binding proteins ( CRABPs ) and antiproliferative effects of the retinoids . P13631 selectively binding retinoids are potent inhibitors of breast cancer cell proliferation , alone and in combination with P01579 . For this reason and because of a possible low toxicity , as compared with retinoic acid , we speculate that these P13631 selective binding retinoids might be of clinical importance .
