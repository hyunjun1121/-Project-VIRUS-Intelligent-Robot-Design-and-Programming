A novel 5-HT1-like receptor subtype mediates DB02527 synthesis in porcine pial vein . The 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) receptor subtype mediating 5-HT inhibition of spontaneous rhythmic contractions ( P12931 ) in the porcine pial vein was characterized . Results from pharmacological studies using in vitro tissue bath techniques indicated that the inhibitory effects of 5-HT on P12931 were qualitatively and quantitatively mimicked by 5-HT1-like agonists 5-methoxytryptamine ( 5-MT ) and 5-carboxamidotryptamine ( 5-CT ) . 5-HT- , 5-MT- , and 5-CT-induced inhibitions of P12931 were attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by methysergide , which yielded similar pA2 values against these three agonists , suggesting that 5-HT , 5-MT , and 5-CT act on the same 5-HT1-like receptors . 5-MT inhibition of P12931 was not affected by blocking 5-HT2 ( with ketanserin and spiperone ) , 5- Q9H205 ( with MDL-72222 and ICS-205-930 ) , or Q13639 ( with ICS-205-930 ) receptors . Neither was 5-MT inhibition of P12931 affected by blocking P08908 ( with propranolol and spiperone ) , P28222 ( with propranolol ) , or P28335 ( with ketanserin ) receptors . Furthermore , 5-HT and 5-MT inhibitions of P12931 were enhanced by cilostazol [ a selective adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( DB02527 ) phosphodiesterase inhibitor ] and were diminished by KT-5720 ( a DB02527 -dependent protein kinase inhibitor ) but were not affected by M & B-22948 [ a selective guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP ) phosphodiesterase inhibitor ] or KT-5823 ( a cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor ) . Biochemical studies further demonstrated that 5-HT inhibition of P12931 in porcine pial veins was accompanied by an increase in DB02527 , but not cGMP , synthesis. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
