5-hydroxytryptamine evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures . Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) results in the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) that mediates the vasorelaxing properties of endothelial cells . The goal of this project was to address the possibility that 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) stimulates P29474 activity in bovine aortic endothelial cell ( BAEC ) cultures . Here , we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT receptors mediate P29474 activation by measuring agonist-stimulated [3H]L-citrulline ( [3H]L- DB00155 ) formation in BAEC cultures . We found that 5-HT stimulated the conversion of [3H]L-arginine ( [3H] DB00125 ) to [3H]L- DB00155 , indicating P29474 activation . The high affinity P28222 receptor agonist , 5-nonyloxytryptamine ( 5-NOT ) -stimulated [3H]L- DB00155 turnover responses were concentration- ( 0.01 nM to 100 microM ) and time-dependent . Maximal responses were observed within 10 min following agonist exposures . These responses were effectively blocked by the P28222 receptor antagonist , isamoltane , the P28222 /5-HT2 receptor antagonist , methiothepin , and the P29474 selective antagonists ( 0.01-10 microM ) : L-Nomega -monomethyl-L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) and L-N omega-iminoethyl-L-ornithine ( L-NIO ) . Pretreatment of BAEC cultures with pertussis toxin ( PTX ; 1-100 ng/ml ) for 16 hr resulted in significant inhibition of the agonist-stimulated P29474 activity , indicating the involvement of Gi proteins . These findings lend evidence of a P28222 receptor/ P29474 pathway , accounting in part for the activation of P29474 by 5-HT . Further investigation is needed to determine the role of other vascular 5-HT receptors in the stimulation of P29474 activity .
