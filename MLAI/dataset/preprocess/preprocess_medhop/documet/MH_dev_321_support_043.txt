Gene transcription abnormalities in canine atopic dermatitis and related human eosinophilic allergic diseases . Canine atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is clinically similar to human AD , implicating it as a useful model of human eosinophilic allergic disease . To identify cutaneous gene transcription changes in relatively early inflammation of canine AD , microarrays were used to monitor transcription in normal skin ( n=13 ) and in acute lesional AD ( P13716 ) and nearby visibly nonlesional AD ( NLAD ) skin ( n=13 ) from dogs . Scanning the putative abnormally transcribed genes , several potentially relevant genes , some abnormally transcribed in both NLAD and P13716 ( e.g. P05231 , Q8NET5 , Q9UJ68 , and P43405 ) , were observed . Comparison for abnormally transcribed genes common to two related human diseases , human AD and asthmatic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( aCRSwNP ) , further identified genes or gene sets likely relevant to eosinophilic allergic inflammation . These included : ( 1 ) genes associated with alternatively activated monocyte-derived cells , including members of the monocyte chemotactic protein ( MCP ) gene cluster , ( 2 ) members of the IL1 family gene cluster , ( 3 ) eosinophil-associated seven transmembrane receptor Q14246 and Q9BY15 genes , ( 4 ) interferon-inducible genes , and ( 5 ) keratin genes associated with hair and nail formation . Overall , numerous abnormally transcribed genes were observed only in canine AD ; however , many others are common to related human eosinophilic allergic diseases and represent therapeutic targets testable in dogs with AD .
