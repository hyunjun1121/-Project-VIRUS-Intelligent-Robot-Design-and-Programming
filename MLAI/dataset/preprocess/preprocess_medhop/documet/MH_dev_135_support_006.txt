Telomere shortening and decreased replicative potential , contrasted by continued proliferation of telomerase-positive CD8+ P10747 (lo) T cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus . To evaluate whether the immune system of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) patients shows features of premature aging , we compared telomere length and proliferative potential of SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) ( N = 90 ) to those of controls ( N = 64 ) . SLE samples showed accelerated loss of telomeric DNA ( P = 0.00008 ) and higher levels of senescent ( < or =5 kb ) telomeric DNA ( P = 0.00003 ) . Viability cell counts and CFSE tracking in 6-week-old cell cultures indicated that SLE PBMC ( CD8+ and P01730 + T cells ) underwent fewer mitotic cycles and had shorter telomeres than controls ( P = 0.04 ) . However , a CD8(+) P10747 (lo) T cell subset expanded preferentially in SLE-derived bulk cultures ( P = 0.0009 ) , preserved telomeric DNA ( P = 0.01 vs entire CD8+ ) , and displayed telomerase activity [ 2.1 telomerase arbitrary units ( P10636 ) vs 0.5 P10636 in CD8+ P10747 (hi) cells and 0.3 P10636 in bulk PBMC ; P = 0.05 ] . These T cell anomalies could be due to chronic in vivo stimulation of the immune system and may contribute to the immune dysregulation found in SLE .
