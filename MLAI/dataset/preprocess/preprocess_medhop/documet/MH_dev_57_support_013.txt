DB00877 unbalances the polarization of human macrophages to M1 . Plasticity is a hallmark of macrophages , and in response to environmental signals these cells undergo different forms of polarized activation , the extremes of which are called classic ( M1 ) and alternative ( M2 ) . DB00877 ( Q96PN7 ) is crucial for survival and functions of myeloid phagocytes , but its effects on macrophage polarization are not yet studied . To address this issue , human macrophages obtained from six normal blood donors were polarized to M1 or M2 in vitro by lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-γ or interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) , respectively . The presence of Q96PN7 ( 10 ng/ml ) induced macrophage apoptosis in M2 but not in M1 . Beyond the impact on survival in M2 , Q96PN7 reduced P61073 , CD206 and Q9NNX6 expression and stem cell growth factor-β , P55774 and Q99616 release . In contrast , in M1 Q96PN7 increased P42081 and P32248 expression and P05231 , tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-1β release but reduced CD206 and Q9NNX6 expression and P22301 , vascular endothelial growth factor and P55774 release . In view of the in vitro data , we examined the in vivo effect of Q96PN7 monotherapy ( 0·1 mg/kg/day ) in 12 patients who were treated for at least 1 month before islet transplant . Cytokine release by O00206 -stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a clear shift to an M1-like profile . Moreover , macrophage polarization 21 days after treatment showed a significant quantitative shift to M1 . These results suggest a role of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) into the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization and propose new therapeutic strategies for human M2-related diseases through P42345 inhibitor treatment .
