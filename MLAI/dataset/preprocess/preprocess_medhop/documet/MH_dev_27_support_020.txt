Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 confers endothelial protection and attenuates atherosclerosis . The endothelium plays a central role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis . One of the main effectors of endothelial dysfunction is P03950 II , and pharmacological approaches to limit P03950 II bioactivity remain the cornerstone of cardiovascular therapeutics . Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( Q9BYF1 ) has been identified as a critical negative modulator of P03950 II bioactivity , counterbalancing the effects of P12821 in determining net tissue P03950 II levels ; however , the role of Q9BYF1 in the vasculature remains unknown . In the present study , we hypothesized that Q9BYF1 is a novel target to limit endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis . To this aim , we performed in vitro gain and loss of function experiments in endothelial cells and evaluated in vivo angiogenesis and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice treated with AdACE2 . Q9BYF1 -deficient mice exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation . Overexpression of Q9BYF1 in human endothelial cells stimulated endothelial cell migration and tube formation , and limited monocyte and cellular adhesion molecule expression ; effects that were reversed in Q9BYF1 gene silenced and endothelial cells isolated from Q9BYF1 -deficient animals . Q9BYF1 attenuated P03950 II-induced reactive oxygen species production in part through decreasing the expression of P13498 . The effects of Q9BYF1 on endothelial activation were attenuated by pharmacological blockade of P03950 -(1-7) with A779 . Q9BYF1 promoted capillary formation and neovessel maturation in vivo and reduced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout mice These data indicate that Q9BYF1 , in an P03950 -(1-7)-dependent fashion , functions to improve endothelial homeostasis via a mechanism that may involve attenuation of NADPHox-induced reactive oxygen species production . Q9BYF1 -based treatment approaches may be a novel approach to limit aberrant vascular responses and atherothrombosis .
