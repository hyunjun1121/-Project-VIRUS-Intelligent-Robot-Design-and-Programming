Thrombosis is reduced by inhibition of P23219 , but unaffected by inhibition of P35354 , in an acute model of platelet activation in the mouse . BACKGROUND : Clinical use of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 appears associated with increased risk of thrombotic events . This is often hypothesised to reflect reduction in anti-thrombotic prostanoids , notably P06744 (2) , formed by P35354 present within endothelial cells . However , whether P35354 is actually expressed to any significant extent within endothelial cells is controversial . Here we have tested the effects of acute inhibition of P36551 on platelet reactivity using a functional in vivo approach in mice . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : A non-lethal model of platelet-driven thromboembolism in the mouse was used to assess the effects of aspirin ( 7 days orally as control ) diclofenac ( 1 mg.kg(-1) , i.v. ) and parecoxib ( 0.5 mg.kg(-1) , i.v. ) on thrombus formation induced by collagen or the thromboxane ( TX ) A(2)-mimetic , U46619 . The P36551 inhibitory profiles of the drugs were confirmed in mouse tissues ex vivo . Collagen and U46619 caused in vivo thrombus formation with the former , but not latter , sensitive to oral dosing with aspirin . Diclofenac inhibited P23219 and P35354 ex vivo and reduced thrombus formation in response to collagen , but not U46619 . DB08439 inhibited only P35354 and had no effect upon thrombus formation caused by either agonist . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Inhibition of P23219 by diclofenac or aspirin reduced thrombus formation induced by collagen , which is partly dependent upon platelet-derived TXA(2) , but not that induced by U46619 , which is independent of platelet TXA(2) . These results are consistent with the model demonstrating the effects of P23219 inhibition in platelets , but provide no support for the hypothesis that acute inhibition of P35354 in the circulation increases thrombosis .
