Desmopressin ( DB00035 ) induces NO production in human endothelial cells via V2 receptor- and DB02527 -mediated signaling . The hemostatic agent desmopressin ( DB00035 ) also has strong vasodilatory effects . DB00035 is a selective agonist for the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) , which is coupled to DB02527 -dependent signaling . DB00035 -induced vasodilation may be due to endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) activation . This hypothesis implies DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation . It also implies wide extrarenal , endothelial P30518 expression . We show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) the DB02527 -raising agents forskolin and epinephrine increase NO production , as measured by a l-NMMA-inhibitable rise in cellular cGMP content . They also increase P29474 enzymatic activity , in a partly calcium-independent manner . DB02527 -mediated P29474 activation is associated with phosphorylation of residue Ser1177 , in a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -independent manner . HUVECs do not express P30518 . However , after heterologous P30518 expression , DB00035 induces DB02527 -dependent P29474 activation via Ser1177 phosphorylation . We have previously found P30518 expression in cultured lung endothelial cells . By real time quantitative RT-PCR , we now find a wide P30518 distribution notably in heart , lung and skeletal muscle . These results indicate that DB00035 and other DB02527 -raising agents can activate P29474 via PI3K-independent Ser1177 phosphorylation in human endothelial cells . This mechanism most likely accounts for DB00035 -induced vasodilation .
