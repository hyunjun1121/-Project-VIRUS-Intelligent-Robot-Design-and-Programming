Acute generalized exanthematic pustulosis : a case and an overview of side effects affecting the skin caused by celecoxib and other P35354 inhibitors reported so far . A 55-year-old woman who was treated for periarthritis humeroscapularis with celecoxib ( DB00482 ) developed a generalized pustular exanthema on the head and upper trunk , accompanied by fever , leukocytosis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate . The histological findings were subcorneal pustules , necrotic keratinocytes , edema in the upper dermis and polymorphic perivascular infiltrates . Four days after stopping celecoxib , the pustules disappeared without any treatment . Four weeks after disappearance of the skin lesions , celecoxib demonstrated a positive lymphocyte stimulation test . In this article , we present to our knowledge the first case of acute generalized exanthematic pustulosis caused by celecoxib , and we give an overview of the side effects affecting the skin caused by celecoxib and other cyclooxygenase type 2 inhibitors reported so far .
