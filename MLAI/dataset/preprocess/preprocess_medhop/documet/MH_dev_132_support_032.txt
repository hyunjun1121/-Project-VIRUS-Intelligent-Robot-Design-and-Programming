Hypoxia-inducible vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy using the oxygen-dependent degradation domain in myocardial ischemia . PURPOSE : A hypoxia-inducible P15692 expression system with the oxygen-dependent degradation ( Q8TAX0 ) domain was constructed and tested to be used in gene therapy for ischemic myocardial disease . METHODS : Luciferase and P15692 expression vector systems were constructed with or without the Q8TAX0 domain : pEpo-SV-Luc ( or pEpo-SV- P15692 ) and pEpo-SV-Luc- Q8TAX0 ( or pEpo-SV- P15692 - Q8TAX0 ) . In vitro gene expression efficiency of each vector type was evaluated in P29320 293 cells under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions . The amount of P15692 protein was estimated by ELISA . The P15692 expression vectors with or without the Q8TAX0 domain were injected into ischemic rat myocardium . Fibrosis , neovascularization , and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were assessed using Masson 's trichrome staining , α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) immunostaining , and the TUNEL assay , respectively . RESULTS : The plasmid vectors containing Q8TAX0 significantly improved the expression level of P15692 protein in hypoxic conditions . The enhancement of P15692 protein production was attributed to increased protein stability due to oxygen deficiency . In a rat model of myocardial ischemia , the pEpo-SV- P15692 - Q8TAX0 group exhibited less myocardial fibrosis , higher microvessel density , and less cardiomyocyte apoptosis compared to the control groups ( saline and pEpo-SV- P15692 treatments ) . CONCLUSION : An Q8TAX0 -mediated P15692 expression system that facilitates P15692 -production under hypoxia may be useful in the treatment of ischemic heart disease .
