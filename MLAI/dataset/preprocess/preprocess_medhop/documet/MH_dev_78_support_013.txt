Mitogen-inducible prostaglandin G/H synthase is expressed in canine mastocytoma cells . A mitogen-inducible prostaglandin G/H synthase ( P35354 or cyclooxygenase-2 ) has recently been cloned from chicken and mouse fibroblasts . This protein is distinct from classic prostaglandin G/H synthase ( P23219 or cyclooxygenase-1 ) but has a similar enzymatic activity . Because P23219 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins , P35354 may also play an important role in prostaglandin production . To examine whether P35354 is induced by phorbol ester in mast cells , we studied mRNA expression of P35354 and also measured prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2 ) production when canine mastocytoma cells were incubated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . P35354 mRNA was induced by PMA , with a maximal induction after 4 h of incubation with 10 nM PMA . There was concentration-dependent production of PGD2 after incubation with PMA . In contrast , P23219 mRNA was expressed in resting cells , and the expression of P23219 mRNA was down-regulated by PMA . Dexamethasone inhibited PMA-induced mRNA expression of P35354 and PGD2 production . DB00945 had no effect on mRNA expression of P35354 but inhibited PGD2 production . In conclusion , P35354 is induced by phorbol ester in canine mast cells . We speculate that P35354 may be important in airway inflammation in which mast cells are activated .
