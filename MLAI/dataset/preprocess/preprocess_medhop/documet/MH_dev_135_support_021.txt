Mer receptor tyrosine kinase is a therapeutic target in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is currently treated with an intense regimen of chemotherapy yielding cure rates near 85 % . However , alterations to treatment strategies using available drugs are unlikely to provide significant improvement in survival or decrease therapy-associated toxicities . Here , we report ectopic expression of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase in pre-B-cell ALL ( B-ALL ) cell lines and pediatric patient samples . Inhibition of Mer in B-ALL cell lines decreased activation of AKT and MAPKs and led to transcriptional changes , including decreased expression of antiapoptotic P05771 gene and increase in proapoptotic Q07812 and BBC3 genes . Further , Mer inhibition promoted chemosensitization , decreased colony-forming potential in clonogenic assays , and delayed disease onset in a mouse xenograft model of leukemia . Our results identify Mer as a potential therapeutic target in B-ALL and suggest that inhibitors of Mer may potentiate lymphoblast killing when used in combination with chemotherapy . This strategy could reduce minimal residual disease and/or allow for chemotherapy dose reduction , thereby leading to improved event-free survival and reduced therapy-associated toxicity for patients with B-ALL . Additionally , Mer is aberrantly expressed in numerous other malignancies suggesting that this approach may have broad applications .
