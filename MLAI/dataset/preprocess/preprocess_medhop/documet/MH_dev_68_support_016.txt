Monoamine oxidase A suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by inhibiting the adrenergic system and its transactivation of P00533 signaling . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 ) , a catecholamine neurotransmitter degrading enzyme , is closely associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders . However , its role in cancer progression remains unknown . METHODS : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) tissue arrays ( n=254 ) were used to investigate the correlation between P21397 expression and clinicopathological findings . In vitro invasion and anoikis assays , and in vivo intrahepatic and lung metastasis models were used to determine the role of P21397 in HCC metastasis . Quantitative real-time PCR , western blotting , immunohistochemical staining and HPLC analysis were performed to uncover the mechanism of P21397 in HCC . RESULTS : We found that P21397 expression was significantly downregulated in 254 clinical HCC samples and was closely correlated with cancer vasoinvasion , metastasis , and poor prognoses . We then demonstrated that P21397 suppressed norepinephrine/epinephrine ( NE/E ) -induced HCC invasion and anoikis inhibition , and uncovered that the effects of NE/E on HCC behaviors were primarily mediated through alpha 1A ( ADRA1A ) and beta 2 adrenergic receptors ( P07550 ) . In addition to the canonical signaling pathway , which is mediated via adrenergic receptors ( ADRs ) , we found that ADR-mediated P00533 transactivation was also involved in NE-induced HCC invasion and anoikis inhibition . Notably , we found that P21397 could synergize with P00533 inhibitors or ADR antagonists to abrogate NE-induced HCC behaviors . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together , the results of our study may provide insights into the application of P21397 as a novel predictor of clinical outcomes and indicate that increasing P21397 expression or enzyme activity may be a new approach that can be used for HCC treatment .
