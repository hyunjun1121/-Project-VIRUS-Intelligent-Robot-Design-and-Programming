miR-17-5p targets the p300/CBP-associated factor and modulates androgen receptor transcriptional activity in cultured prostate cancer cells . BACKGROUND : P10275 ( AR ) signalling is critical to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) . Transcriptional activity of AR involves chromatin recruitment of co-activators , including the p300/CBP-associated factor ( Q92831 ) . Distinct miRNA expression profiles have been identified in PCa cells during the development and progression of the disease . Whether miRNAs regulate Q92831 expression in PCa cells to regulate AR transcriptional activity is still unclear . METHODS : Expression of Q92831 was investigated in several PCa cell lines by qRT-PCR , Western blot , and immunocytochemistry . The effects of Q92831 expression on AR-regulated transcriptional activity and cell growth in PCa cells were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation , reporter gene construct analysis , and MTS assay . Targeting of Q92831 by miR-17-5p was evaluated using the luciferase reporter assay . RESULTS : Q92831 was upregulated in several PCa cell lines . Upregulation of Q92831 promoted AR transcriptional activation and cell growth in cultured PCa cells . Expression of Q92831 in PCa cells was associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p . Targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of Q92831 mRNA by miR-17-5p caused translational suppression and RNA degradation , and , consequently , modulation of AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells . CONCLUSIONS : Q92831 is upregulated in cultured PCa cells , and upregulation of Q92831 is associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p . Targeting of Q92831 by miR-17-5p modulates AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in cultured PCa cells .
