P00533 pathway gene expressions and biological response of glioblastoma multiforme cell lines to erlotinib . BACKGROUND : Erlotinib , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor , exerts highly variable antiproliferative effects on human glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) cells in vitro and in vivo . As these effects are independent of P00533 baseline expression levels , more complex genetic signatures may form the molecular basis of the erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant GBM phenotypes . The aim of the current study was to determine which genes within the P00533 signaling pathway are candidates for mediating the cellular response of human GBM towards erlotinib . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Complementary (c)RNAs from cell lines selected to represent the sensitive , intermediately responsive and resistant phenotypes , respectively , were hybridized to CodeLink Human Whole Genome Bioarrays . RESULTS : Expression analysis of the prospectively selected 244 genes whose products constitute the P00533 signaling pathway identified five genes the expression of which significantly correlated with phenotype . Functional annotation analysis revealed one ( STATI ) and two ( Q9NWM8 , P63000 ) genes conclusively associated with sensitivity and resistance to erlotinib , respectively . Moreover , two additional genes ( P35408 , MYC ) were unexpectedly found to be associated with sensitivity . The gene expressions were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction . CONCLUSION : Five genes within the P00533 signaling pathway may modulate GBM response to erlotinib , which further emphasizes the importance of this pathway for the biology of GBM .
