Prevalence and management of panic attacks during infliximab infusion in psoriatic patients . BACKGROUND : Psoriasis is a chronic , inflammatory skin disease associated with anxiety and depression . DB00065 ( IFX ) is a human/mouse chimeric anti- P01375 -Î± antibody effective in the treatment of psoriasis . OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of panic disorders in psoriatic patients during IFX infusions . METHODS : A retrospective study was performed on patients affected with psoriasis who were treated with IFX from 2002 to 2011 at a single center . Panic disorders were defined using the clinical criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition . A population of dermatological patients under treatment with IVG , rituximab , apheresis , intravenous corticosteroids and antibiotics was considered as the control group . RESULTS : A total of 141 patients were evaluated . Of these , 6 ( 4.25 % ) experienced panic attacks during the infusion ; 16 ( 11.3 % ) had a medical history of panic attack and of those 5/16 ( 31 % ) experienced panic attacks during IFX infusion . In the control group panic attacks were not recorded . CONCLUSION : We describe 6 cases of patients in whom panic attacks were triggered by IFX infusion . Premedication with oral benzodiazepine and a slow rate of infusion is recommended .
