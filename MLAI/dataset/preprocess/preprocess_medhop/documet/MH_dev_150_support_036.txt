Androgens and metabolic syndrome : lessons from androgen receptor knock out ( ARKO ) mice . DB00624 ( T ) is an important factor for determining body composition in males . Abdominal obesity is inversely correlated with serum T levels in men , leading to greater mortality . Pathologically hypogonadal men also have a significantly higher fat mass , which is reversed by T administration . However , the mechanism for such anti-obesity effect of androgen has not been well clarified . P10275 ( AR ) null male mice revealed late-onset obesity . Male ARKO mice were euphagic compared to the wild-type male controls , but also less dynamic and less oxygen consuming . Transcript profiling indicated that male ARKO mice had lower transcripts for the thermogenetic uncoupling protein 1 ( P25874 ) . We also found enhanced secretion of adiponectin , which is insulin-sensitizing , from adipose tissue in comparison to wild type , which might partly explain why the overall insulin sensitivity of male ARKO mice remained almost intact despite their apparent obesity . In addition , decreased lipolysis rather than increased lipid synthesis was observed , which might also account for the increased adiposity in male ARKO mice . The results revealed that AR plays important roles in male metabolism by affecting the energy balance , and is negative to both adiposity and insulin sensitivity .
