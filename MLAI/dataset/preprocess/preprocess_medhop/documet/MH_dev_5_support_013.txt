Recent advances in classical and non-classical antifolates as antitumor and antiopportunistic infection agents : Part II . Antifolates that inhibit the key enzymes thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) have found clinical utility as antitumor and antiopportunistic agents . DB00563 { MTX , ( 1 ) } and 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) were among the first clinically useful P00374 and TS inhibitors , respectively . The development of resistance to DB00544 , its occasional unpredictable activity and toxicity resulted in the search of novel antifolates . DB00642 ( 4 ) and raltitrexed ( 5 ) are newer antifolates that specifically inhibit TS , and are clinically useful as antitumor agents . A major mechanism of tumor resistance to clinically useful antifolates is based on their need for polyglutamylation via the enzyme folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . Recently , classical antifolates that do not need to be polyglutamylated have also been developed and include plevitrexed ( 6 ) and GW1843 ( 7 ) . Nolatrexed ( 8 ) , trimethoprim { P54849 , ( 11 ) } and piritrexim { PTX , ( 12 ) } are nonclassical antifolates for antitumor and parasitic chemotherapy that passively diffuse into cells and hence do not have to depend on Q05932 or the reduced folate carrier ( P41440 ) . Structural requirements for inhibition with antifolates have been studied extensively and novel agents that exploit key interactions in the active site of TS , P00374 , Q05932 , and P41440 have been proposed . This two-part review discusses the design , synthesis and structural requirements for TS and P00374 inhibition and their relevance to antitumor and parasitic chemotherapy , since 1996 . Monocyclic and 6-5 fused bicyclic antifolates were discussed in Part I . The 6-6 bicyclic and tricyclic antifolates will be discussed here in Part II .
