Integration of hormone signaling in the regulation of human DB00146 24-hydroxylase transcription . The current study sought to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the cross talk between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] and activators of PKC in the regulation of 25(OH)D(3) 24-hydroxlyase [ 24(OH)ase ] . Transfection of the h24(OH)ase promoter construct [ -5,500/-22 luciferase ; vitamin D response elements at -294/-274 and -174/-151 ; AP-1 site at -1,167/-1,160 ] in vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) -transfected COS-7 cells resulted in strong activation by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) . In these cells , cotreatment with the PKC activator TPA and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) yielded a 27-fold increase in luciferase activity , which was 2- to 3-fold greater than activation obtained with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) alone ( P < 0.05 ) . Similar results were observed using LLCPK-1 kidney cells , suggesting that the previously observed enhancement of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced renal 24(OH)ase mRNA and activity by PKC activation occurs at the level of transcription . The functional cooperation between PKC activation and P11473 was not found to be mediated by the AP-1 site in the h24(OH)ase promoter or by enhanced binding of GRIP or Q15648 to P11473 and was also not due to PKC-mediated phosphorylation of P11473 on DB00133 (51) . Our study demonstrates that , in LLCPK-1 kidney cells , the PKC enhancement of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-stimulated transcription may be due , in part , to an increase in P11473 concentration . In addition , inhibitors of the MAPK pathway were found to decrease the TPA enhancement ( P < 0.05 ) . Because activation of MAPK has been reported to result in the phosphorylation of Q15788 and in functional cooperation between Q15788 and CREB binding protein , we propose that the potentiation of P11473 -mediated transcription may also be mediated through changes in the phosphorylation of specific P11473 coregulators .
