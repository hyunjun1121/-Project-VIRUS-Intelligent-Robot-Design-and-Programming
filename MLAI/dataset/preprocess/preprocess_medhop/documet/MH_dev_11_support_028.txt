Mapping of an ordered set of 14 cosmids to human chromosome 12p by two-color in situ hybridization . To map human chromosome 12p aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) , cosmids were isolated or obtained for 14 known 12p loci ( D12S119 , D12S158 , D12S178 , P36941 , D12S380E , P01023 , Q13936 , P10767 , P04406 , P01116 , P04280 , P20742 , P60174 , and P04275 ) . Using two-color Q5TCZ1 with three labeled probes to interphase nuclei , and to prometaphase chromosomes where possible , the order of these loci was sequentially determined to be pter-D12S158-D12S380E- Q13936 - P10767 - P36941 - P04275 - P04406 - P60174 - P01023 - P20742 - P04280 -D12S 178-D12S119- P01116 -cen . Two cell lines were analyzed with this set of cosmids . The EBV-transformed cell line TA carries a der(12) with a deletion of bands 12p13.1 --> p11.2.D12S178 , D12S119 , and P01116 were absent in the der(12) , whereas the other loci were present . The second cell line , GM01203A , exhibits a balanced t(4;12) ( 4q25 ; 12p13.3 ) with a breakpoint between P10767 and P36941 .
