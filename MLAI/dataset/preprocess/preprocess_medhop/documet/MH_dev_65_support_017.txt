Disparate effects of simvastatin on angiogenesis during hypoxia and inflammation . AIMS : Studies have shown that some of statin 's pleiotropic effects were achieved by either promotion or inhibition of angiogenesis , depending on the underlying disease . This study tested the hypothesis that the angiogenic potential of simvastatin is related to the microenvironmental conditions . MAIN METHODS : Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were studied after exposure to hypoxia or the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , with or without co-incubation with simvastatin ( 1 micromol/L ) and mevalonate . HUVEC angiogenesis was evaluated by tube formation , migration , and proliferation assays . Hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) -1alpha , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , Akt , endothelium nitric oxide synthase ( e-NOS ) , and oxidative stress were evaluated . KEY FINDINGS : HUVEC angiogenesis increased during hypoxia ( tube length 14.7+/-0.5 vs. 7.8+/-0.6 mm , p < 0.05 ) and further enhanced by simvastatin ( 19.3+/-1.1 mm , p < 0.05 vs. hypoxia alone ) , which downregulated the expression of the Q9BYW2 inhibitor Q9GZT9 and upregulated HIF-1alpha , P15692 , and Akt , without changing oxidative stress or P29474 . Incubation with P01375 promoted HUVEC angiogenesis ( 7.4+/-0.2 vs. 6.5+/-0.2 mm , p < 0.05 ) with increased oxidative stress . However , simvastatin inhibited this promotion ( 2.5+/-0.3 mm , p < 0.001 vs. P01375 alone ) by decreasing oxidative stress , P15692 , Akt , and P29474 . SIGNIFICANCE : We conclude that at the same dosage , simvastatin can either promote or inhibit angiogenesis , possibly by activating upstream regulators of HIF-1alpha in hypoxia , but conversely interfering with angiogenic signaling downstream to inflammation . These opposing angiogenic effects should be considered in the therapeutic strategies with statins .
