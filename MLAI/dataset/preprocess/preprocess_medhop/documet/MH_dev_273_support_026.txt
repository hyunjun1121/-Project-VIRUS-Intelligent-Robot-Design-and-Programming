DB00439 , an inhibitor of P04035 , inhibits urokinase/urokinase-receptor expression and P14780 secretion by peripheral blood monocytes -- a possible protective mechanism against atherothrombosis . It is now recognised that acute myocardial infarction results from the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques . Lymphocytes and macrophages , which infiltrate rupture sites , contribute to plaque degradation by expressing urokinase ( u-PA ) bound to cell membrane by urokinase receptor ( u-PAR ) and by secreting metalloproteinase P14780 . We have previously demonstrated that the uptake of oxidised LDL ( ox-LDL ) by monocytes induces an increase of u-PA and u-PAR expression . The present study shows that the expression of u-PA and u-PAR induced by ox-LDL on monocyte surface is suppressed by cerivastatin ( a synthetic inhibitor of P04035 , Bayer ) from 2 nM . This leads to reduced plasmin generation and monocyte adhesion to vitronectin . Furthermore , higher concentrations of cerivastatin ( 50-100 nM ) reduce the expression of u-PA and u-PAR on unstimulated monocytes . It also inhibits P14780 secretion but has no effect on P01033 secretion , suggesting that the decrease in P14780 has a real protective effect on plaque stabilisation . The inhibitory effect of cerivastatin on u-PA expression and P14780 secretion can be explained by the inhibition of NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus , as shown by immunofluorescence . As farnesyl-pyrophosphate reverses the effect of cerivastatin , it is postulated that these effects could also be due to the inhibition of Ras prenylation . This was confirmed by confocal microscopy , which shows the Ras delocalisation from the monocyte membrane . The cerivastatin-induced effects on monocyte functions could explain , at least in part , the protective effect of this drug against atherothrombotic events .
