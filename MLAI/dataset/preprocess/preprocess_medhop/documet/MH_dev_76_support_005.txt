DB01373 -sensing receptor activation in chronic kidney disease : effects beyond parathyroid hormone control . Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) is an important complication of advanced chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . DB01012 , an allosteric modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) expressed in parathyroid glands , is the only calcimimetic approved to treat SHPT in patients on dialysis . By enhancing P41180 sensitivity for plasma extracellular calcium ( Ca(2+)0 ) , cinacalcet reduces serum parathyroid hormone , Ca(2+)0 , and serum inorganic phosphorous concentrations , allowing better control of SHPT and CKD-mineral and bone disorders . Of interest , the P41180 also is expressed in a variety of tissues where its activation regulates diverse cellular processes , including secretion , apoptosis , and proliferation . Thus , the existence of potential off-target effects of cinacalcet can not be neglected . This review summarizes our current knowledge concerning the potential role(s) of the P41180 expressed in various tissues in CKD-related disorders , independently of parathyroid hormone control .
