DB00013 receptor interacts with alpha(v)beta5 vitronectin receptor , promoting urokinase-dependent cell migration in breast cancer . Perturbation of adhesive interactions at cell-substratum and cell-cell contact sites is a critical event in the multistep process of cancer invasion . Recent studies indicate that the urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) is associated in large molecular complexes with other molecules , such as integrins . To test the possibility that Q03405 may physically and functionally interact with vitronectin ( Vn ) receptors , we determined the expression level of Q03405 , alpha(v)beta3 , and alpha(v)beta5 Vn receptors in 10 human breast carcinomas . Here , we show the ability of Q03405 to physically associate with alpha(v)beta5 in the breast carcinomas examined . The functional effects of this interaction were studied using HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell lines , both exhibiting a urokinase-dependent physical association between Q03405 and alpha(v)beta5 . Both cell lines respond to urokinase or to its noncatalytic amino-terminal fragment by exhibiting remarkable cytoskeletal rearrangements that are mediated by alpha(v)beta5 and require protein kinase C activity . On the contrary , binding of Vn to alpha(v)beta5 results in the protein kinase C-independent formation of F-actin containing microspike-type structures . Furthermore , alpha(v)beta5 is required for urokinase-directed , receptor-dependent MCF-7 and HT1080 cell migration . These data show that Q03405 association with alpha(v)beta5 leads to a functional interaction of these receptors and suggest that Q03405 directs cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration by altering alpha(v)beta5 signaling specificity .
