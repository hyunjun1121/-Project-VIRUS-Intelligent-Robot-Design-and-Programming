Emergence of motor circuit activity . In the developing nervous system , ordered neuronal activity patterns can occur even in the absence of sensory input and to investigate how these arise , we have used the model system of the embryonic chicken spinal motor circuit , focusing on motor neurons of the lateral motor column ( O15467 ) . At the earliest stages of their molecular differentiation , we can detect differences between medial and lateral O15467 neurons in terms of expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits , including P30532 , P36544 , Q12879 , P39086 , P08908 and P28222 , as well as the Q9H2X9 transporter . Using patch-clamp recordings we also demonstrate that medial and lateral O15467 motor neurons have subtly different activity patterns that reflect the differential expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits . Using a combination of patch-clamp recordings in single neurons and calcium-imaging of motor neuron populations , we demonstrate that inhibition of nicotinic , muscarinic or GABA-ergic activity , has profound effects of motor circuit activity during the initial stages of neuromuscular junction formation . Finally , by analysing the activity of large populations of motor neurons at different developmental stages , we show that the asynchronous , disordered neuronal activity that occurs at early stages of circuit formation develops into organised , synchronous activity evident at the stage of O15467 neuron muscle innervation . In light of the considerable diversity of neurotransmitter receptor expression , activity patterns in the O15467 are surprisingly similar between neuronal types , however the emergence of patterned activity , in conjunction with the differential expression of transmitter systems likely leads to the development of near-mature patterns of locomotor activity by perinatal ages .
