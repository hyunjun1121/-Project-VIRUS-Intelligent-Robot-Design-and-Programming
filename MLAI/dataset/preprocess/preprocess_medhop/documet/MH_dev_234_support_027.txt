Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the DB00669 antimigraine agents : a comparative review . The current approach to antimigraine therapy comprises potent serotonin P28222 /1D receptor agonists collectively termed triptans . Sumatriptan was the first of these compounds to be developed , and offered improved efficacy and tolerability over ergot-derived compounds . The development of sumatriptan was quickly followed by a number of ' second generation ' DB00669 compounds , characterised by improved pharmacokinetic properties and/or tolerability profiles . Triptans are believed to effect migraine relief by binding to serotonin ( 5-hydroxy-tryptamine ) receptors in the brain , where they act to induce vasoconstriction of extracerebral blood vessels and also reduce neurogenic inflammation . Although the pharmacological mechanism of the triptans is similar , their pharmacokinetic properties are distinct . For example , bioavailability of oral formulations ranges between 14 % ( sumatriptan ) and 74 % ( naratriptan ) , and their elimination half-life ranges from 2 hours ( sumatriptan and rizatriptan ) to 25 hours ( frovatriptan ) . Clearly , such diverse pharmacokinetic properties will influence the effectiveness of the compounds and favour the prescription of one over another in different patient populations . This article reviews the pharmacological properties of the triptans ( time to peak plasma concentration , half-life , bioavailability and receptor binding ) and relates these properties to efficacy and time of onset . It also considers the effects of concomitant medication , food , age and disease on the pharmacokinetics of the compounds . In addition , the relative merits , such as headache recurrence , tolerability and route of administration , are discussed . Finally , the performance of the triptans is considered in the context of direct head-to-head comparative trials that have assessed the efficacy profile of the compounds .
