Effect of P06850 on NO bioavailability , ROS production and antioxidant defense systems in endothelial EAhy926 cells . Local or ' Immune ' DB01285 -Releasing Hormone ( P06850 ) is secreted in peripheral tissues and plays a direct immunomodulatory role as an endocrine or paracrine mediator of inflammation . The present study was undertaken to determine whether P06850 affects the endothelial redox state . Accordingly , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) content and peroxynitrite levels , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity and nitric oxide ( NO ) levels as well as catalase activity , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity and glutathione ( DB00143 ) levels were measured in the presence or absence of selective P06850 receptor-1 and P06850 receptor-2 inhibitors in endothelial EAhy926 cells exposed in vitro in 10(-7) M P06850 for 2 h . P06850 acting through both receptors induced a significant increase of ROS content ( p < 0.001 ) , catalase activity ( p < 0.001 ) and SOD activity ( p < 0.001 ) , accompanied by a simultaneous significant decrease of P29474 activity and NO levels ( p < 0.001 ) , as well as a significant increase in nitrotyrosine ( peroxynitrite ) levels ( p < 0.05 ) . The data indicate that P06850 may act as a regulator of pro-inflammatory mechanisms inducing adaptation of endothelial cell function to local stress .
