Pharmacologic modulation of niche accessibility via tyrosine kinase inhibition enhances marrow and thymic engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Essential survival signals within hematopoietic stem cell ( P19526 ) and thymic niches are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases , which can be reversibly inhibited using clinically available drugs . We studied whether sunitinib , a multityrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits P10721 , enhances engraftment after bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in mice . DB01268 diminished hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers , and sunitinib enhanced marrow , peripheral myeloid , and lymphoid engraftment after BMT in Rag1(-/-) mice . DB01268 augmented P19526 engraftment because recipients displayed increased myeloid and lymphoid engraftment and because sunitinib-treated recipients of purified HSCs showed enhanced engraftment of secondary hosts . However , sunitinib preferentially augmented T-cell engraftment with lesser effects on myeloid and P19526 engraftment . Consistent with this , sunitinib preferentially depleted the early thymic progenitor subset in the thymus . DB01268 did not increase engraftment in mice with deficient P10721 signaling , and the pattern of more potent effects on T cell compared with P19526 engraftment observed in sunitinib-treated hosts was also observed after BMT into P10721 (W/Wv) mice . These results implicate P10721 as a critical modulator of thymic niches . We conclude that transient , pharmacologic inhibition of P10721 enhances accessibility of marrow and thymic niches , and provides a novel , noncytotoxic approach to accomplish engraftment after stem cell transplantation .
