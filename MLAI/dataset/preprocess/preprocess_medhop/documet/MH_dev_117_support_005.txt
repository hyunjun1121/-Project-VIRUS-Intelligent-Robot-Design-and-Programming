Q15070 -mir-125b-2 is highly expressed in childhood P41212 / Q01196 ( P41212 / Q01196 ) leukemias and confers survival advantage to growth inhibitory signals independent of p53 . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) regulate the expression of multiple proteins in a dose-dependent manner . We hypothesized that increased expression of miRNAs encoded on chromosome 21 ( chr 21 ) contribute to the leukemogenic function of trisomy 21 . The levels of chr 21 miRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR in four types of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) characterized by either numerical ( trisomy or tetrasomy ) or structural abnormalities of chr 21 . Suprisingly , high expression of the hsa-mir-125b-2 cluster , consisting of three miRNAs , was identified in leukemias with the structural P41212 / Q01196 abnormality and not in ALLs with trisomy 21 . Manipulation of P41212 / Q01196 expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that the high expression of the miRNA cluster is an event independent of the P41212 / Q01196 fusion protein . Overexpression of hsa-mir-125b-2 conferred a survival advantage to Ba/ P13726 cells after P08700 withdrawal or a broad spectrum of apoptotic stimuli through inhibition of caspase 3 activation . Conversely , knockdown of the endogenous miR-125b in the P41212 / Q01196 leukemia cell line P23141 increased apoptosis after Doxorubicin and DB02010 treatments . P04637 protein levels were not altered by miR-125b . Together , these results suggest that the expression of hsa-mir-125b-2 in P41212 / Q01196 ALL provides survival advantage to growth inhibitory signals in a p53-independent manner .
