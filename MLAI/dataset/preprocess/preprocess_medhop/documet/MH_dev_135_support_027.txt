Transcriptional response to ionizing radiation in lymphocyte subsets . Human lymphocyte subpopulations differ in their cellular responses to ionizing radiation . To shed light on the molecular basis of this effect , we characterized the transcriptional response to 1 Gy X-rays of P01730 + T lymphocytes . Of 18,433 genes tested , 102 were modulated more than 1.5-fold . The majority of the strongly activated genes were p53 targets involved in DNA repair and apoptosis . The expression of three of these genes was further tested by quantitative RT-PCR in lymphocyte subpopulations [ P01730 + and CD8+ T , P15391 + B , CD56+ natural killer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) ] from ten adult donors . In contrast to Q92466 , O14763 and Q07812 were differentially modulated among the subpopulations and the PBLs , being more activated in irradiated P15391 + B and CD8+ T lymphocytes . The level of Q07812 activation in the various subpopulations correlated with the sensitivity of the cells to radiation , suggesting its possible role in the differential radiosensitivity of hematopoietic cell subsets .
