The use of P01375 blocking agents in rheumatoid arthritis : an update . P01375 has been found to play a pivotal role in the pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Drugs targeting P01375 have been developed to neutralise the deleterious effects of this inflammatory cytokine . There are , at present , three drugs available for the treatment of RA patients with active disease who are refractory to conventional treatments including methotrexate : 2 monoclonal antibodies , infliximab and adalimumab , and a fusion protein with p75 receptors , etanercept . These three agents have proved to be effective and safe in large placebo-controlled trials enrolling patients with established or early disease and showed effectiveness in controlling signs and symptoms of the disease , improving quality of life and in slowing and even arresting the progression of radiographic damage . With the long-term surveillance of these drugs were described serious adverse events , particularly infections such as tuberculosis , especially with infliximab . The risk for malignancies under P01375 antagonists , especially lymphoma , remains controversial . Specific recommendations are given by international experts for selecting and monitoring RA patients with P01375 antagonists . Other drugs targeting P01375 such as PEGylated molecules ( DB08904 or certolizumab ) are in development . These new biological therapies blocking P01375 undoubtedly constitute a considerable advancement in the management of RA , but careful evaluation at the initiation of the treatment and long-term surveillance of the patients receiving such drugs remains necessary .
