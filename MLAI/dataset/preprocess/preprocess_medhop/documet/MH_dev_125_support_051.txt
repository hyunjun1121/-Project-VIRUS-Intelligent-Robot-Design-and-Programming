Analysis of biological and technical variability in gene expression assays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded classical Hodgkin lymphomas . DB03843 -fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissues are invaluable sources of biological material for research and diagnostic purposes . In this study , we aimed to identify biological and technical variability in RT-qPCR TaqManÂ® assays performed with FFPE-RNA from lymph nodes of classical Hodgkin lymphoma samples . An Q9UNW9 -nested 6-level design was employed to evaluate P10415 , P42574 , Q15306 , P61626 and P42224 gene expression . The most variable genes were P42574 ( low expression ) and P61626 ( high expression ) . Total variability decreased after normalization for all genes , except by P61626 . Genes with moderate and low expression were identified and suffered more the effects of the technical manipulation than high-expression genes . Pre-amplification was shown to introduce significant technical variability , which was partially alleviated by lowering to a half the amount of input RNA . Ct and Cy0 quantification methods , based on cycle-threshold and the kinetic of amplification curves , respectively , were compared . Cy0 method resulted in higher quantification values , leading to the decrease of total variability in P42574 and P61626 genes . The mean individual noise was 0.45 ( 0.31 to 0.61 SD ) , indicating a variation of gene expression over ~1.5 folds from one case to another . We showed that total variability in RT-qPCR from FFPE-RNA is not higher than that reported for fresh complex tissues , and identified gene- , and expression level-sources of biological and technical variability , which can allow better strategies for designing RT-qPCR assays from highly degraded and inhibited samples .
