Role of vitamin D receptor in the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol in tumor-derived endothelial cells and tumor angiogenesis in vivo . Calcitriol ( DB00136 ) , the major active form of vitamin D , is antiproliferative in tumor cells and tumor-derived endothelial cells ( TDEC ) . These actions of calcitriol are mediated at least in part by vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , which is expressed in many tissues including endothelial cells . To investigate the role of P11473 in calcitriol effects on tumor vasculature , we established TRAMP-2 tumors subcutaneously into either P11473 wild-type ( WT ) or knockout ( KO ) mice . Within 30 days post-inoculation , tumors in KO mice were larger than those in WT ( P < 0.001 ) . TDEC from WT expressed P11473 and were able to transactivate a reporter gene whereas TDEC from KO mice were not . Treatment with calcitriol resulted in growth inhibition in TDEC expressing P11473 . However , TDEC from KO mice were relatively resistant , suggesting that calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition on TDEC is P11473 -dependent . Further analysis of the TRAMP- P06681 tumor sections revealed that the vessels in KO mice were enlarged and had less pericyte coverage compared with WT ( P < 0.001 ) . Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase in vascular volume of TRAMP tumors grown in P11473 KO mice compared with WT mice ( P < 0.001 ) and FITC-dextran permeability assay suggested a higher extent of vascular leakage in tumors from KO mice . Using ELISA and Western blot analysis , there was an increase of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha , vascular endothelial growth factor , angiopoietin 1 , and platelet-derived growth factor-BB levels observed in tumors from KO mice . These results indicate that calcitriol-mediated antiproliferative effects on TDEC are P11473 -dependent and loss of P11473 can lead to abnormal tumor angiogenesis .
