[ Comparative study of main components of ginseng on immune function of rats ] . DB01404 and its effective components are famous for their influence to enhance human immunity , regulate endocrine and antioxidant action . However , the different effects of different components are not clear . In this study , Wistar rats were used to study the effects of main components of ginseng , including total ginsenoside , panaxadiol saponins , panaxtrol saponin and ginseng polysaccharide . The results showed that the effects of panaxadiol saponins and ginseng polysaccharide on improving animal immune organ weight , plasma interleukin 2 ( P60568 ) , interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) , plasma gamma-interferon ( IFN-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -α ) were better than that of the other groups . Total ginsenoside and panaxtrol saponin can effectively increase the concentration of spleen NK cells ( NKC ) while panaxadiol saponins and ginseng polysaccharide can significantly increase the concentrations of rat plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) , corticosterone ( O00230 ) and thyroid stimulating hormone ( DB00024 ) . As for the effect of increasing organization nitric oxide ( NO ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , glutathione ( DB00143 ) and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , total ginsenoside is better than that of other groups . In brief , different components in ginseng possess different effects on enhancing immunity , regulating endocrine and resisting oxidation . Panaxadiol saponins and ginseng polysaccharide are better in enhancing immune , and total ginsenoside shows advantages in resisting oxidation and stress .
