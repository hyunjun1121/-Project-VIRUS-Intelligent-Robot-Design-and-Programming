HCV NS5A and Q00978 compete for CypA binding . BACKGROUND & AIMS : P62937 ( CypA ) is vital for HCV replication . Cyp inhibitors successfully decrease viral loads in HCV-infected patients . However , their mechanisms of action remain unknown . Since interferon ( IFN ) can also suppress HCV replication , we asked whether a link between CypA and the IFN response exists . METHODS : We used cellular and recombinant pulldown approaches to investigate the possibility of a specific association of CypA with host ligands . RESULTS : We found for the first time that CypA binds to a major component of the IFN response - the IFN regulatory factor 9 ( Q00978 ) . Q00978 is the DNA-binding component of the transcriptional IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 ( ISGF3 ) . CypA binds directly to Q00978 via its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase ( PPIase ) pocket . Cyp inhibitors such as cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) or non-immunosuppressive derivates such as alisporivir and SCY-635 , prevent Q00978 -CypA complex formation . CypA binds to the C-terminal Q969Q1 -association-domain ( IAD ) , but not to the DNA-binding or linker domains of Q00978 . Remarkably , CypA associates with the multimeric ISGF3 complex . We also obtained evidence that CypA neutralization enhances IFN-induced transcription . Interestingly , the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) non-structural 5A ( NS5A ) protein , which is known to modulate the IFN response , competes with Q00978 for CypA binding and can prevent the formation of Q00978 -CypA complexes . CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates for the first time that CypA binds specifically to a component of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK/ P35610 ) pathway , Q00978 . This study also reveals a novel opportunity of HCV to modulate the IFN response via NS5A .
