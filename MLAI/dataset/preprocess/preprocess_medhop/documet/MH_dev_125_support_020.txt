DB01017 with aspirin : an approach to attenuate diabetic nephropathy in rats . Degradation of extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) by enhanced production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) in diabetes leads to nephropathy . Cyclooxygenases ( P36551 ) further increase levels of these MMPs . The objective of present study was to inhibit P08253 and P14780 by combination of minocycline and aspirin to treat diabetic nephropathy . Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by streptozotocin ( Q11206 , 55 mg/kg i.p. ) . Four weeks after diabetes induction , the rats were treated with minocycline ( 50 mg/kg , p.o. ) , aspirin ( 50 mg/kg , p.o. ) , or minocycline ( 50 mg/kg , p.o. ) plus aspirin ( 50 mg/kg , p.o. ) for a period of 4 weeks . At the end of eighth week fluid input , urine output , and renal function tests were carried out for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy . Renal hypertrophy was measured and histopathology was done to evaluate renal damage . Diabetes produced significant loss of body weight , polyuria , polydipsia , hyperglycemia , and increase in blood pressure . Serum creatinine , urea , and blood urea nitrogen levels were found to be increased significantly in the Q11206 group diabetic rats . Treatment with combination of minocycline and aspirin significantly prevented the rise in creatinine , urea , and blood urea nitrogen levels and increased creatinine clearance . Image analysis of kidneys revealed that collagen level was significantly decreased in combined treated group when compared with control . Results of present study suggest that P08253 and P14780 inhibition in presence of P36551 inhibitor prevents the development of experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats and can be a potential approach for the treatment .
