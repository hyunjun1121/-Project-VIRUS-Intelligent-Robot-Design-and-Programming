P15018 upregulates expression of P25103 in NHBE cells . P15018 ( P15018 ) , a cytokine at the interface between neurobiology and immunology , is mainly mediated through JAK/ P35610 pathway and MAPK/ P29323 pathway . Evidence suggested P15018 is related to the higher expression of neurokinin-1 receptor ( P25103 ) in asthma . In this study , the immunohistochemistry stain showed the expressions of P25103 , P15018 , p- P40763 , and p- P27361 /2 in the lung tissues of allergic rats were increased compared with the controls , and the main positive cell type was airway epithelial cell . Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with P15018 in the presence or absence of AG490 ( O60674 inhibitor ) , PD98059 ( MEK inhibitor ) , and the siRNA against P40763 . Western blot and RT-PCR indicated that P15018 induced the expression of P25103 , which was inhibited by the inhibitors mentioned above . No significant interaction was found between JAK/ P35610 pathway and MAPK/ P29323 pathway . In summary , bronchial epithelial cell changes in asthma are induced by P15018 which promotes the expression of P25103 , and JAK/ P35610 pathway and MAPK/ P29323 pathway may participate in this process .
