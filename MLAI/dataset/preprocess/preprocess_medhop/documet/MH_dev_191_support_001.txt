A gene-centric analysis of activated partial thromboplastin time and activated protein C resistance using the HumanCVD focused genotyping array . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) is an important routine measure of intrinsic blood coagulation . Addition of activated protein C ( P25054 ) to the aPTT test to produce a ratio , provides one measure of P25054 resistance . The associations of some genetic mutations ( eg , factor V Leiden ) with these measures are established , but associations of other genetic variations remain to be established . The objective of this work was to test for association between genetic variants and blood coagulation using a high-density genotyping array . Genetic association with aPTT and P25054 resistance was analysed using a focused genotyping array that tests approximately 50 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in nearly 2000 cardiovascular candidate genes , including coagulation pathway genes . Analyses were conducted on 2544 European origin women from the British Women 's Heart and Health Study . We confirm associations with aPTT at the coagulation factor XII ( P00748 ) / P43250 ( P43250 ) and kininogen 1 ( P01042 ) /histidine-rich glycoprotein ( P04196 ) loci , and identify novel SNPs at the P16442 locus and novel locus kallikrein B ( P03952 ) / P03951 . In addition , we confirm association between P25054 resistance and factor V Leiden mutation , and identify novel SNP associations with P25054 resistance in the P04196 and P12259 /solute carrier family 19 member 2 ( O60779 ) regions . In conclusion , variation at several genetic loci influences intrinsic blood coagulation as measured by both aPTT and P25054 resistance .
