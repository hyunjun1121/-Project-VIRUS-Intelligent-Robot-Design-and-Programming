Alloreactive memory T cells are responsible for the persistence of graft-versus-host disease . Graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) is caused by a donor T cell anti-host reaction that evolves over several weeks to months , suggesting a requirement for persistent alloreactive T cells . Using the C3H.SW anti-C57BL/6 ( B6 ) mouse model of human GVHD directed against minor histocompatibility Ags , we found that donor CD8(+) T cells secreting high levels of P01579 in GVHD B6 mice receiving C3H.SW naive CD8(+) T cells peaked by day 14 , declined by day 28 after transplantation , and persisted thereafter , corresponding to the kinetics of a memory T cell response . Donor CD8(+) T cells recovered on day 42 after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation expressed the phenotype of P16070 (high)CD122(high)CD25(low) , were able to homeostatically survive in response to P60568 , P13232 , and P40933 and rapidly proliferated upon restimulation with host dendritic cells . Both allogeneic effector memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(low) ) and central memory ( P16070 (high)CD62L(high) ) CD8(+) T cells were identified in B6 mice with ongoing GVHD , with effector memory CD8(+) T cells as the dominant ( > 80 % ) population . Administration of these allogeneic memory CD8(+) T cells into secondary B6 recipients caused virulent GVHD . A similar allogeneic memory P01730 (+) T cell population with the ability to mediate persistent GVHD was also identified in BALB/b mice receiving minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched B6 T cell-replete bone marrow transplantation . These results indicate that allogeneic memory T cells are generated in vivo during GVH reactions and are able to cause GVHD , resulting in persistent host tissue injury . Thus , in vivo blockade of both alloreactive effector and memory T cell-mediated host tissue injury may prove to be valuable for GVHD prevention and treatment .
