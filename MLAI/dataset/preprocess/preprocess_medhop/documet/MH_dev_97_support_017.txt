MicroRNAs in thyroid cancer . CONTEXT : Traditionally , factors predisposing to diseases are either genetic ( " nature " ) or environmental , also known as lifestyle-related ( " nurture " ) . Papillary thyroid cancer is an example of a disease where the respective roles of these factors are surprisingly unclear . EVIDENCE ACQUISITION : Original articles and reviews summarizing our current understanding of the role of microRNA in thyroid tumorigenesis are reviewed and evaluated . CONCLUSION : The genetic predisposition to papillary thyroid cancer appears to consist of a variety of gene mutations that are mostly either of low penetrance and common or of high penetrance but rare . Moreover , they likely interact with each other and with environmental factors . The culpable genes may not be of the traditional , protein-coding type . A limited number of noncoding candidate genes have indeed been described , and we propose here that the failure to find mutations in traditional protein-coding genes is not coincidental . Instead , a more likely hypothesis is that changes in the expression of multiple regulatory RNA genes , e.g. microRNAs , may be a major mechanism . Our review of the literature strongly supports this notion in that a polymorphism in one microRNAs ( miR-146a ) predisposes to thyroid carcinoma , whereas numerous other microRNAs are involved in signaling ( mainly P60484 /PI3K/AKT and DB00279 / P10828 ) that is central to thyroid carcinogenesis .
