Epigenetics , an early event in the modulation of gene expression by inositol hexaphosphate in ethylnitrosourea exposed mouse lungs . Mechanisms of anticancer effects of inositol hexaphosphate are not fully understood . Epigenetic changes are the early changes in tumorigenesis . DNA methyl transferases , methyl CpG binding proteins , methyl CpG DNA binding domain protein , and histone deacetylases are the major molecules involved in epigenetics . We have shown the effects of IP6 at the molecular level in mouse lungs before the tumor is developed . After 3 mo of ENU exposure , there was no tumor formation , but there was hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in the lungs . Inflammation and DNA damage repair enzymes P35354 and P40692 appear to be upregulated , whereas tumor suppressor gene p16 was downregulated by ENU . On the other hand , ENU exposure more or less upregulated the epigenetic events such as the expressions of P26358 , MeCP2 , Q9UIS9 , and Q13547 . This alteration was reduced by IP6 administration . Results were supported by modulation of global DNA methylation and the modulation of promoter CpG methylation of p16 , P40692 , and P35354 genes . Hence , this study indicates the possible role of epigenetics at the early stage of tumor development and in the regulation of gene expression by IP6 before the onset of ENU-induced lung tumors .
