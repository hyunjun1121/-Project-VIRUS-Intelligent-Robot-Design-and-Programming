Invasion and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma . Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) represents over 80 % of kidney cancer , and about 30 % of the patients with RCC develop metastasis after the surgery . Invasion of basement membrane ( BM ) and extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) is an essential event in tumor invasion and metastasis . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , which digest the main components of BM and Q13201 , are expressed in RCC . Q9Y251 , which degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans , is predominantly expressed in high-grade RCCs with a positive correlation with pathological tumor stage and poor prognosis . Bone metastasis is common among the patients with RCC , and increased osteoclastic activity was observed at metastatic sites . Receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand ( O14788 ) , which plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis , is predominantly expressed in high-grade RCC and its expression level is associated with bone metastasis and prognosis . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a switch of epithelial cells to sarcomatoid phenotype , is considered to be critical step during metastasis , and Snail , a major regulator of EMT , is predominantly expressed in high-grade RCC , and high Snail expression is a worse prognostic factor . Accordingly , heparanase , O14788 and Snail may be targets for the development of anti-tumor therapies for RCCs .
