Astroglial P21554 cannabinoid receptors regulate leptin signaling in mouse brain astrocytes . Type-1 cannabinoid ( P21554 ) and leptin ( ObR ) receptors regulate metabolic and astroglial functions , but the potential links between the two systems in astrocytes were not investigated so far . Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of P21554 receptor expression and activity in cultured cortical and hypothalamic astrocytes demonstrated that cannabinoid signaling controls the levels of ObR expression . Lack of P21554 receptors also markedly impaired leptin-mediated activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and 5 ( P40763 and P42229 ) in astrocytes . In particular , P21554 deletion determined a basal overactivation of P42229 , thereby leading to the downregulation of ObR expression , and leptin failed to regulate P42229 -dependent glycogen storage in the absence of P21554 receptors . These results show that P21554 receptors directly interfere with leptin signaling and its ability to regulate glycogen storage , thereby representing a novel mechanism linking endocannabinoid and leptin signaling in the regulation of brain energy storage and neuronal functions .
