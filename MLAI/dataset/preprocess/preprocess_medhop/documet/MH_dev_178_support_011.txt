Substituted benzamides with conformationally restricted side chains . 5 . Azabicyclo[x.y.z] derivatives as Q13639 receptor agonists and gastric motility stimulants . The syntheses of benzamides containing azabicyclo[x.y.z] side chains and their Q13639 receptor agonist and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonist properties are described . These compounds were designed to mimic higher energy conformations of quinolizidine and indolizidine . High potency was achieved for both activities although an exactly paralleling SAR was not apparent . Introduction of O and S resulted in only marginal differences in potency which was more apparent for 5- Q9H205 antagonism . The introduction of a methyl group alpha to the basic nitrogen resulted in a reduction in Q13639 receptor agonist potency . DB04917 ( 5f ) was identified for further evaluation for which both enantiomers had an identical pharmacological profile , as did an azatricyclic 9b , which contained a combination of the steric bulk of the two separate enantiomers .
