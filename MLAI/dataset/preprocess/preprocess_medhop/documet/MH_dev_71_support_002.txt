A phase II study of pralatrexate with vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation for previously treated recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer . BACKGROUND : DB06813 ( Fotolyn(TM) ; Allos Therapeutics Inc. ) is an antifolate dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitor . We conducted a phase II study of pralatrexate with folic acid and B12 supplementation in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer ( R/M HNSCC ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : This was a single-arm , Simon optimal two stage phase II study . Patients with R/M HNSCC previously treated with chemotherapy were eligible . The study was initiated with a dosing schedule of pralatrexate 190 mg/m(2) biweekly on a 4-week cycle with vitamin supplementation . Due to toxicity concerns , the dosing was modified to 30 mg/m(2) weekly for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle with vitamin supplementation . Radiologic imaging was to be obtained about every 2 cycles . RESULTS : Thirteen subjects were enrolled ; 12 were treated . Seven of the twelve patients had previously received â‰¥2 lines of chemotherapy . The most common grade 3 toxicity was mucositis ( 3 patients ) . Seven patients did not complete two cycles of therapy due to progression of disease ( 4 ) , toxicity ( 1 ) , death ( 1 ) , and withdrawal of consent ( 1 ) . Two deaths occurred : one due to disease progression and the other was an unwitnessed event that was possibly related to pralatrexate . No clinical activity was observed . The median overall survival was 3.1 months . The study was closed early due to lack of efficacy . CONCLUSIONS : DB06813 does not possess clinical activity against previously treated R/M HNSCC . Evaluation of pralatrexate in other clinical settings of HNSCC management with special considerations for drug toxicity may be warranted .
