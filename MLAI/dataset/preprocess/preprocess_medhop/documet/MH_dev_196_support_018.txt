GLC756 decreases P01375 via an alpha2 and beta2 adrenoceptor related mechanism . GLC756 , a polyvalent anti-glaucoma drug showed in an endotoxin-induced-uveitis model ( EIU ) in rats a significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) decrease in serum , indicating an additional anti-inflammatory potential of this compound . The receptors on which GLC756 binds ( D1 , D2 , D4 , alpha-1 , alpha-2 , P08908 , P28335 , P28221 , 5-HT2 A , beta-1 , and beta-2 ) were suggested to play a role . In order to identify a receptor type mediating the P01375 lowering response , GLC756 was combined with various counteracting compounds ( CP ) . For EIU , 8-week-old Lewis rats were intravenously injected at 160 microg lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) from Salmonella typhimurium . Before EIU-induction animals received either one of the CP 's or GLC756 alone , or GLC756 in combination with one of the CP 's . P01375 was determined in serum 2h post EIU-induction . Treatment with CP 's alone indicated that agonistic effects on beta-2 adrenoceptors and antagonistic effects on alpha-2 , P08908 and P28221 receptors resulted in statistically significant decreased P01375 levels in comparison to the LPS-control group . In combination with GLC756 , the counteracting CP 's domitor ( alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist ) and ICI 118551 ( beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist ) inhibited completely the P01375 decreasing effect of GLC756 . Counteracting the P08908 receptor with the P08908 agonist 8-OH-DPAT could not prevent the P01375 decreasing effect of GLC756 . In conclusion , the antagonistic effect on alpha-2 adrenoceptors and the agonistic effect on beta-2 adrenoceptors were identified as mechanism for the P01375 decreasing effect of GLC756 .
