Enhanced IgE allergic response to Aspergillus fumigatus in P13569 -/- mice . To gain insight into aberrant cytokine regulation in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , we compared the phenotypic manifestations of allergen challenge in gut-corrected P13569 -deficient mice with background-matched C57Bl6 ( B6 ) mice . Aspergillus fumigatus ( Af ) antigen was used to mimic allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , a peculiar hyper-IgE syndrome with a high prevalence in CF patients . P13569 -/- , C57BL/6 and FVB/NJ mice were sensitized with Af antigen by serial intraperitoneal injections . Control mice were mock sensitized with PBS . Challenges were performed by inhalation of Af antigen aerosol . After Af antigen challenge , histologic analysis showed goblet cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in both strains . However , total serum IgE levels were markedly elevated in CF mice . Sensitized CF mice showed a five-fold greater IgE response to sensitization as compared with B6- and FVB-sensitized controls . Additional littermate controls to fully normalize for B6-FVB admixture in the strain background confirmed the role of P13569 mutation in the hyper-IgE syndrome . Cytokine mRNA levels of P05113 and GM- P04141 in the bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid , and BAL cell differentials indicated that P13569 mutation caused a shift from an P05113 -predominant to an P05112 -predominant cytokine profile . This system models a very specific type of airway inflammation in CF and could provide insights into pathogenesis and treatment of the disease .
