The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in pancreatic β cell function and survival : therapeutic implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus . The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus involves both peripheral insulin resistance and dysfunctional insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cell . Currently , there is intense research focus on delineating the etiologies of pancreatic β cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes . However , there remains an unmet clinical need to establish therapeutic guidelines and strategies that emphasize the preservation of pancreatic β cell function in at-risk and affected individuals . Thiazolidinediones are orally active agents approved for use in type 2 diabetes and act as agonists of the nuclear hormone receptor Q07869 -γ . These drugs improve insulin sensitivity , but there is also a growing appreciation of Q07869 -γ actions within the β cell . Q07869 -γ has been shown to regulate directly key β cell genes involved in glucose sensing , insulin secretion and insulin gene transcription . Further , pharmacologic Q07869 -γ activation has been shown to protect against glucose- , lipid- , cytokine- and islet amyloid polypeptide ( P10997 ) -induced activation of numerous stress pathways . This article will review the mechanisms by which Q07869 -γ activation acts to maintain β cell function and survival in type 2 diabetes mellitus and highlight some of the current controversies in this field .
