Suppression of dendritic cell maturation by Trichinella spiralis excretory/secretory products . Evidence from experimental studies indicates that during chronic infections with certain helminth species a regulatory network is induced that can down-modulate not only parasite-induced inflammation but also reduce other immunopathologies such as allergies and autoimmune diseases . The mechanisms however , and the molecules involved in this immunomodulation are unknown . Here , we focus on the effect of Trichinella spiralis excretory/secretory antigens ( TspES ) on the innate immune response by studying the effect of TspES on DC maturation in vitro . Bone marrow-derived DC from BALB/c mice were incubated with TspES either alone or in combination with LPS derived from two different bacteria . As indicators of DC maturation , the cytokine production ( IL-1alpha , P05231 , P22301 , IL-12p70 and P01375 ) and the expression of various surface molecules ( MHC-II , P25942 , P33681 and P42081 ) were measured . Results indicate that while TspES alone did not change the expression of the different surface molecules or the cytokine production , it completely inhibited DC maturation induced by Escherichia coli LPS ( E. coli LPS ) . In contrast , DC maturation induced by LPS from another bacterium , Neisseria meningitidis , was not affected by TspES . These results were confirmed using O00206 / Q9Y6Y9 / P08571 transfected P29320 293 cells . In conclusion , T. spiralis ES antigens lead to suppression of DC maturation but this effect depends on the type of LPS used to activate these cells .
