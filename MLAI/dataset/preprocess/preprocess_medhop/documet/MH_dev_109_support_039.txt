The effects of P08514 -IIIa antagonists and a combination of three other antiplatelet agents on platelet-leukocyte interactions . The effects of the P08514 -IIIa antagonists abciximab and MK-852 on platelet-leukocyte interactions in vitro were studied and the results compared with those obtained with a combination of aspirin , dipyridamole and AR-C69931 ( DB00128 /Dip/AR-C ) . Platelet-monocyte ( P/M ) and platelet-neutrophil ( P/N ) conjugate formation increased when blood was stirred or a platelet agonist was added . Leukocyte activation also occurred as judged by expression of surface tissue factor antigen and CD11b . DB00054 and MK-852 potentiated P/M , especially when collagen was used . They also increased the amount of tissue factor on the monocytes , but not CD11b . The DB00128 /Dip/AR-C did not enhance P/M or tissue factor exposure . Augmented tissue factor expression on monocytes in the presence of a P08514 -IIIa antagonist may be relevant to the increased mortality associated with trials of such antagonists when given orally in patients with vascular disease . The DB00128 /Dip/AR-C was superior to abciximab and MK-852 in inhibiting platelet and leukocyte function .
