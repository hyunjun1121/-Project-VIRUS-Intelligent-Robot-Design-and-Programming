Coupling of serotonergic input to DB01221 receptor-phosphorylation following peripheral nerve injury via rapid , synaptic up-regulation of P03891 . Evidence implicates serotonergic input to spinal dorsal horn neurons in shifting the DB01221 receptor ( NMDAR ) into a high functional output profile after spinal nerve ligation ( Q16658 ) . We investigated the involvement of adaptor protein P03891 ( P03891 ) in NMDAR-phosphorylation and spinal hyperexcitability secondary to peripheral nerve injury . Immunofluorescence for P03891 was found in dorsal horn neurons immunopositive for NMDAR subunit Q9UHB4 . Co-localization of P03891 with postsynaptic marker P78352 was significantly increased 60min after Q16658 ( Rr 0.77 vs Rr 0.06 in sham controls ; z=-242.85 ; p < 0.01 at Fisher 's exact test ) . Western blot analyses confirmed P03891 up-regulation both in cytoplasmic ( S2 ) and synaptic ( P09131 ) compartments ( p < 0.01 at the Student 's t test ) . Q16658 was followed by increased co-localization of P03891 with the phosphorylated form ( serine 896 ) of Q9UHB4 ( pNMDA ) . Spinal superfusion with P03891 inhibitor rotenone prevented up-regulation of P03891 ( Rr 0.06 after rotenone vs Rr 0.78 in vehicle-treated controls , z=-253.22 , p < 0.01 ) and pNR1 in P09131 . C fiber-evoked dorsal horn field potentials were increased 60min after Q16658 by superfusion with DB01221 agonist cis-ACPD at 100nM ( p < 0.01 at the Bonferroni test ) , however cis-ACPD was effective only at 10Î¼M following prior administration of rotenone . Rotenone also abolished enhancement of evoked potentials induced by simultaneous stimulation of DB01221 and 5-HR2B receptors in uninjured rats . Increased postsynaptic up-regulation of P03891 /pNMDAR 60min after Q16658 was prevented by prior administration of selective P41595 antagonist SB204741 . These results support a pivotal role for P03891 in coupling serotonergic input to NMDAR-activation during neuropathic pain .
