A mechanistic rationale for combining alemtuzumab and rituximab in the treatment of ALL . B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) may express P31358 and P11836 . DB00087 ( ALM ) and rituximab ( RTX ) are therapeutic antibodies directed against P31358 and P11836 , respectively , but showed limited activity against ALL in clinical trials . The mechanisms for the impaired responses remained unclear . We studied expression of P31358 and P11836 on ALL cells and found that most cases coexpressed P31358 and P11836 . However , distinct P31358 -negative ( P31358 (-) ) subpopulations were detected in most cases as the result of defective glycophosphatidyl-inositol anchoring . Although ALM efficiently eradicated P31358 -positive ( P31358 (+) ) cells in NOD/scid mice engrafted with primary human ALL , P31358 (-) subclones escaped therapy . In the same model , RTX showed limited activity resulting from occurrence of P11836 down-modulation . However , P31358 (-) cells concurrently lacked the glycophosphatidyl-inositol-anchored complement regulators P08174 and P13987 and showed increased susceptibility to RTX-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro . At the same time , ALM was shown to inhibit down-modulation of P11836 in response to RTX by depleting the trogocytic capacity of phagocytic cells . Probably because of these complementary mechanisms , combined administration of ALM and RTX induced complete responses in vivo . Based on these data , we propose a mechanistic rationale for combined application of RTX and ALM in ALL .
