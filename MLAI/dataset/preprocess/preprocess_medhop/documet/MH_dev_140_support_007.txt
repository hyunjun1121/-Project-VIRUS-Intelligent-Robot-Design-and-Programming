Pharmacogenomics of methadone maintenance treatment . DB00333 is the major opioid substitution therapy for opioid dependence . Dosage is highly variable and is often controlled by the patient and prescriber according to local and national policy and guidelines . Nevertheless many genetic factors have been investigated including those affecting its metabolism ( P20813 -consistent results ) , efflux transport ( P-gp-inconsistent results ) , target μ-opioid receptor ( μ-opioid receptor-inconsistent results ) and a host of other receptors ( P14416 ) and signaling elements ( P48051 and P32121 ; not replicated ) . None by themselves have been able to substantially explain dosage variation ( the major but not sole end point ) . When multiple genes have been combined such as P08183 , P20813 , P35372 and P14416 a greater contribution to dosage variation was found but not as yet replicated . As stabilization of dosage needs to be made rapidly , it is imperative that larger internationally based studies be instigated so that genetic contribution to dosage can be properly assessed , which may or may not tailor to different ethnic groups and each country 's policy towards an outcome that benefits all .
