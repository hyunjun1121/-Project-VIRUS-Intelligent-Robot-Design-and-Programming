Neuronal specific increase of phosphatidylserine by docosahexaenoic acid . DB00144 ( PS ) , the major acidic phospholipid class in eukaryotic biomembranes , plays an important role in various signaling pathways . We have previously demonstrated that docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 , 22:6n-3 ) positively modulates PS biosynthesis and accumulation in neuronal cells , promoting survival . In this paper , we demonstrate that the increase of PS levels upon DB01708 enrichment is not a universal mechanism , but specific to neuronal cells . When cells were enriched with 20 muM DB01708 , 18:0 , 22:6-PS increased in both neuronal ( Neuro 2A ) and non-neuronal cells ( Chinese hamster ovary P04264 cells , NIH-3T3 , and human embryonic kidney cells ) . However , the increase of the total PS level was observed only in Neuro 2A cells because of the fact that other PS species , such as 18:0 , 18:1-PS and 18:1 , 18:1-PS decreased significantly in non-neuronal cells , compensating for the increase of 18:0 , 22:6-PS . DB01708 enrichment did not affect the messenger RNA levels of PS synthase 1 ( PSS1 ) and Q9BVG9 . Over-expression of genes encoding PSS1 or Q9BVG9 altered neither the PS level nor the effect of DB01708 on PS increase in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells . From these results , it is concluded that the PS increase by DB01708 , specifically observed in neuronal cells , may represent a unique mechanism for expanding the PS pool so far known in mammalian cells .
