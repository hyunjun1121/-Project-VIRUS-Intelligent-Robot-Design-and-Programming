Inhibition of P42345 restores cisplatin sensitivity through down-regulation of growth and anti-apoptotic proteins . We show that cisplatin resistance in certain lung cancer cell lines can be reversed through inhibition of P42345 ( mammalian Target of DB00877 ) . These cell lines appear to possess high levels of phospho- P42345 , phospho-AKT and other growth-related proteins , such as hTERT ( human telomerase reverse transcriptase ) , and P12004 D3 which decrease upon inhibition of P42345 . Interestingly in one cisplatin resistant cell line which expresses P10415 /BCLxL , treatment with P42345 inhibitor ( CCI-779 ) results in decreased levels of these anti-apoptotic proteins and may contribute to increasing apoptosis . Moreover , continuous exposure to CCI-779 was found to increase the expression of the multi-drug resistant P-gp1(P-gycoprotein1) efflux pump and therefore should be taken into consideration when designing clinical trials with this compound .
