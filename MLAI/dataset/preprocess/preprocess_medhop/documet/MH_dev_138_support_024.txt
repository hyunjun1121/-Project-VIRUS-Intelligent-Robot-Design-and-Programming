DB08860 , an P04035 inhibitor , exerts P29474 -independent protective actions against angiotensin II induced cardiovascular remodeling and renal insufficiency . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular remodeling leading to hypertension , myocardial infarction , and stroke . DB08860 , an P04035 inihibitor , is known to have pleiotropic actions against the development of cardiovascular remodeling . The objectives of this study were to clarify the beneficial effects as well as the mechanism of action of pitavastatin against Ang II-induced organ damage . C57BL6/J mice at 10 weeks of age were infused with Ang II for 2 weeks and were simultaneously administered pitavastatin or a vehicle . DB08860 treatment improved Ang II-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and attenuated enhancement of cardiac fibrosis , cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , coronary perivascular fibrosis , and medial thickening . Ang II-induced oxidative stress , cardiac TGFbeta-1 expression , and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were all attenuated by pitavastatin treatment . DB08860 also reduced Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction in P29474 -/- mice as in wild-type mice . In P29474 -/- mice , the Ang II-induced cardiac oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway were enhanced , and pitavastatin treatment attenuated the enhanced oxidative stress and the signaling pathway . Moreover , pitavastatin treatment reduced the high mortality rate and improved renal insufficiency in Ang II-treated P29474 -/- mice , with suppression of glomerular oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway . In conclusion , pitavastatin exerts P29474 -independent protective actions against Ang II-induced cardiovascular remodeling and renal insufficiency through inhibition of the TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway by suppression of oxidative stress .
