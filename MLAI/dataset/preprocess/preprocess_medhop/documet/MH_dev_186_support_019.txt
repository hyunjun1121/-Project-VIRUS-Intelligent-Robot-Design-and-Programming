Unbalanced placental expression of imprinted genes in human intrauterine growth restriction . Imprinted genes control fetal and placental growth in mice and in rare human syndromes , but the role of these genes in sporadic intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) is less well-studied . We measured the ratio of mRNA from a maternally expressed imprinted gene , Q53GA4 , to that from a paternally expressed imprinted gene , Q5EB52 , by Northern blotting in 38 IUGR-associated placentae and 75 non-IUGR placentae and found an increase in the Q53GA4 / Q5EB52 mRNA ratio in IUGR ( p=0.0001 ) . Altered expression of Q53GA4 and Q5EB52 was not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation within their imprinting centers , and immunohistochemistry showed Q53GA4 protein appropriately restricted to villous and intermediate cytotrophoblast in the IUGR placentae . We next did a genome-wide survey of mRNA expression in 14 IUGR placentae with maternal vascular under-perfusion compared to 15 non-IUGR placentae using Affymetrix U133A microarrays . In this series six imprinted genes were differentially expressed by Q9UNW9 with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05 , with increased expression of Q53GA4 and decreased expression of Q5EB52 , Q9UI56 , P50440 , GNAS and Q9UM63 in IUGR placentae . At lower significance , we found P01344 mRNA decreased and P49918 mRNA increased in the IUGR cases . We confirmed the significant reduction in Q9UI56 non-translated RNA in IUGR placentae by Northern blotting . In addition to imprinted genes , the microarray data highlighted non-imprinted genes acting in endocrine signaling ( P41159 , P06850 , P15428 , P08476 ) , tissue growth ( IGF1 ) , immune modulation ( P14902 , PSG-family genes ) , oxidative metabolism ( P35754 ) , vascular function ( P30556 , P53805 ) and metabolite transport ( O00585 -family solute carriers ) as differentially expressed in IUGR vs. non-IUGR placentae .
