Metabolic fate of 2,2-dimethylbutyryl moiety of simvastatin in rats : identification of metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry . Metabolic pathways of simvastatin ( DB00641 ) , a lactone prodrug of an inhibitor of P04035 , were elucidated in male rats , using the [ 14C ] -labelled compound . Evidence has been obtained for hydrolysis of simvastatin and its metabolites at their 2,2-dimethylbutyryl moieties . Metabolites identified in plasma were 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid ( P28068 ) , 2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid ( DMHB ) and an open chain hydroxy acid of simvastatin : metabolites identified in urine were DMHB , a glucuronide and the glycine conjugate of P28068 . They were characterized by gas chromatography/electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry as phenacyl or pertrimethylsilylated derivatives . The structures of the metabolites and the aglycone of the glucuronide were confirmed as phenacyl esters by comparison of their chromatographic data and mass spectra with those of the phenacyl derivatives of authentic compounds .
