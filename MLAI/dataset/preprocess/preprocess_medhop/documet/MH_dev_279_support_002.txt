DB01095 upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity via enhancement of its phosphorylation and expression and via an increase in tetrahydrobiopterin in vascular endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : An P04035 inhibitor , fluvastatin , appears to act directly on the blood vessel wall to stabilize plaques in situ , agents that share this property have been termed vascular statins . METHODS : We investigated the effects of fluvastatin on endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) phosphorylation and expression , as well as terahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) metabolism , in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . RESULTS : DB01095 was observed to enhance P29474 phosphorylation at DB00133 -1177 and DB00133 -633 through the P19957 -kinase/Akt and PKA pathways , respectively . Inhibition of P29474 phosphorylation using inhibitors of these pathways attenuated acute NO release in response to fluvastatin . The mRNA of P30793 ( GTPCH ) , the rate-limiting enzyme of the first step of de novo BH4 synthesis , as well as P29474 , was upregulated in HUVEC treated with fluvastatin . In parallel with this observation , fluvastatin increased intracellular BH4 . Pre-treatment of HUVEC with the selective GTPCH inhibitor , 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine , reduced intracellular BH4 and decreased citrulline formation following stimulation with ionomycin . Furthermore , the potentiating effect of fluvastatin was reduced by limiting the cellular availability of BH4 . CONCLUSIONS : Our data demonstrate that fluvastatin phosphorylates and activates P29474 , and increases P29474 expression in vascular endothelial cells . In addition to modulating P29474 , fluvastatin potentiates GTPCH gene expression and BH4 synthesis , thereby increasing NO production and preventing relative shortages of BH4 .
