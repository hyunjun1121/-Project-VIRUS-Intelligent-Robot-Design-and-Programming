DB05229 sodium , prostacyclin analogue , attenuates glomerular hyperfiltration and glomerular macrophage infiltration by modulating ecNOS expression in diabetic rats . Stable prostacyclin analogue , beraprost sodium ( BPS ) has recently been reported to attenuate glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetic rats , however , the mechanism has been still unknown . We previously reported that overexpression of endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase ( ecNOS ) in afferent arterioles and glomeruli induce inappropriate dilatation of afferent arterioles and glomerular hyperfiltration through overproduction of nitric oxide in early stage of diabetic nephropathy . In this study , we tested the hypothesis that BPS ameliorates glomerular hyperfiltration through modulating ecNOS expression in diabetic nephropathy . Furthermore , we examined the effects of BPS on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and macrophage infiltration in diabetic glomeruli , because glomerular hyperfiltration induces the expression of P05362 resulting in macrophage infiltration . Male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats were administered continuously with BPS for 4 weeks after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin . In diabetic rats , the diameters of afferent arterioles , glomerular volume , creatinine clearance and urinary excretion of albumin and NO2/NO3 were increased as compared with non-diabetic control rats . Treatment with BPS improved these changes . The expression of ecNOS was increased in afferent arterioles and glomeruli in diabetic rats and suppressed by BPS . P43119 was expressed along afferent arterioles . Our results suggest that BPS attenuates glomerular hyperfiltration by modulating ecNOS expression in early stage of diabetic nephropathy . Moreover , BPS may inhibit P05362 -dependent infiltration of macrophages in diabetic glomeruli .
