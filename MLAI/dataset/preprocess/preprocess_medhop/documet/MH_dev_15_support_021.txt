Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors in the central nervous system in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) prolongs survival in the mutant P00441 transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) , whereas dysregulation of P15692 through deletion of its hypoxia-regulatory element causes motor neuron degeneration in mice . We investigated the expression of P15692 and its major agonist receptors in the normal central nervous system and in patients with P35858 . Immunohistochemistry demonstrated similar expression patterns of P15692 and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) in the spinal cord with finely punctate staining of the neuropil and strong expression in anterior horn cells ( AHCs ) . Granular staining on the surface of some AHCs , similar to that seen with synaptic markers , suggested synaptic labeling . P35968 staining was reduced in the neuropil of P35858 cases ( p=0.018 ) associated with a reduction of synaptophysin but not P60880 expression . A greater proportion of AHCs in P35858 cases showed low expression of P15692 ( p=0.006 ) and P35968 ( p=0.009 ) compared with controls . Expression of P15692 and P35968 was confirmed by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( QPCR ) . The similar expression patterns of P15692 and P35968 suggests autocrine/paracrine effects on spinal motor neurons , and the reduction in their expression seen in P35858 cases would support the hypothesis that , as in mouse models of the disease , reduced P15692 signaling may play a role in the pathogenesis of P35858 .
