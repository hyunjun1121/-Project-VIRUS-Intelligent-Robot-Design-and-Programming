Substance P stimulates neovascularization in vivo and proliferation of cultured endothelial cells . We have investigated the possible effect of DB05875 ( SP ) , a main mediator of neurogenic inflammation , on the growth of capillary vessels in vivo , and on the proliferation of cultured endothelial cells in vitro . Slow release preparations of SP were implanted into the avascular cornea of New Zealand White rabbits and vessel growth was monitored daily through a slit lamp stereomicroscope . SP ( 1-5 micrograms/pellet ) induced a marked neovascularization . A selective P25103 agonist [ beta-Ala4 , Sar9 , DB00134 (O2)11 ] -SP(4-11) also induced neovascularization . The addition of SP to serum-free cultured endothelial cells , isolated from bovine adrenals ( P56817 ) and from human umbilical cord veins ( HUVE ) , increased proliferation of both cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal activity at 10(-8) M ( P56817 ) and 10(-10) M ( HUVE ) . The selective P25103 agonist induced a similar proliferative action on both cell lines , while the selective P21452 agonist [ beta-Ala8 ] - P20366 (4-10) and the selective P29371 agonist [ MePhe7 ] -NKB had no significant effect . Two different SP antagonists [ D-Pro2 , D-Trp7,9 ] -SP and [ D-Pro4 , D-Trp7,9,Phe11 ] -SP ( 4-11 ) blocked the response to SP . These findings indicate that SP can directly stimulate the process of neovascularization , probably through induction of endothelial cell proliferation . This hitherto unraveled activity of SP could play a key role in the trophic action produced by activation of the efferent function of peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons .
