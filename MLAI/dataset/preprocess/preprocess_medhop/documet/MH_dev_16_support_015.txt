Risk variants in the P04271 gene predict elevated P04271 serum concentrations in healthy individuals . Several lines of evidence suggest an important role of the P04271 protein and its coding gene in different neuropathological and psychiatric disorders like dementia , bipolar affective disorders and schizophrenia . To clarify whether a direct link exists between gene and gene product , that is , whether P04271 variants directly modulate P04271 serum concentration , 196 healthy individuals were assessed for P04271 serum concentrations and genotyped for five potentially functional P04271 SNPs . Functional variants of the serotonergic genes P08908 and 5-HTT possibly modulating P04271 serum levels were also studied . Further , publicly available human postmortem gene expression data were re-analyzed to elucidate the impact of P04271 , P08908 and 5-HTT SNPs on frontal cortex P04271 mRNA expression . Several P04271 SNPs , particularly rs9722 , and the P04271 haplotype T-G-G-A ( including rs2186358-rs11542311-rs2300403-rs9722 ) were associated with elevated P04271 serum concentrations ( Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05 ) . Of these , rs11542311 was also associated with P04271 mRNA expression directly ( Bonferroni corrected P = 0.05 ) and within haplotype G-A-T-C ( rs11542311-rs2839356-rs9984765-rs881827 ; P = 0.004 ) , again with the G-allele increasing P04271 expression . Our results suggest an important role of P04271 SNPs on P04271 serum concentrations and P04271 mRNA expression . It hereby links recent evidence for both , the impact of P04271 gene variation on various neurological or psychiatric disorders like dementia , bipolar affective disorders and schizophrenia and the strong relation between P04271 serum levels and these disorders .
