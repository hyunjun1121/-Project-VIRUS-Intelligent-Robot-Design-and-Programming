Antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy of P35354 specific inhibition : from investigational trials to clinical experience . Research strongly indicates that increased expression of the isoenzyme cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) is responsible for elevated production of prostaglandins in inflamed joint tissues and is involved in the mediation of pain . In contrast , P23219 is a constitutively produced isoenzyme that is involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids that have important homeostatic functions , for example , in the gastric mucosa and platelets . This new knowledge led to the development of drugs that are highly specific inhibitors of P35354 while not inhibiting P23219 at maximally efficacious dosages . The first P35354 specific agent approved for clinical use in the United States was celecoxib . Large multicenter trials have shown that celecoxib at dosages of 100 mg P55957 and 200 mg P55957 is as effective as naproxen 500 mg P55957 in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip . Another large multicenter trial also demonstrated that celecoxib 200 mg P43251 and 400 mg P55957 is as effective as naproxen 500 mg P55957 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . A comparative trial showed that celecoxib 200 mg P55957 is as effective as diclofenac SR 75 mg P55957 in patients with RA . The potential of P35354 specific inhibitors to provide antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy equivalent to that of conventional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs without the adverse gastrointestinal mucosal and platelet effects associated with nonspecific P36551 inhibitors promises to revolutionize the clinical care of arthritis patients .
