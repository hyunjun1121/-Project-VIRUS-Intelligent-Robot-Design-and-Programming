Experience from the Argentine DB00082 Observational Study : preliminary data . The P10912 antagonist pegvisomant is an efficient agent to achieve biochemical control of acromegaly in those cases refractory to surgery and medical therapy with somatostatin analogs . We conducted an observational multicenter study consisting of data collection in accordance with the standard management of patients with acromegaly in everyday practice . We reviewed the medical records of 28 patients , 23 females , who were treated with pegvisomant due to the lack of biochemical response or intolerance to the somatostatin analogs . The objective was to monitor long-term safety and efficacy of the antagonist . 82 % of the patients had previous pituitary surgery , 53.6 % radiotherapy and 96.4 % received medical therapy for acromegaly . Only 19.2 % of the patients had pituitary residual tumor size larger than 1 cm , the remainder harbored a microadenoma or no visible tumor in the pituitary images . In terms of biochemical efficacy , P05019 levels decreased to normal ranges in 45 % and 58.8 % of patients after 3 and 6 months of treatment , respectively , the daily mean dose of pegvisomant being 9.6+/-1.1 mg . Adverse events , potentially related to pegvisomant were reported in 6 patients ( 21.4 % ) , local injection site reaction and elevated liver enzymes being the most frequent . Tumor size did not show enlargement in the evaluated population ( 15 patients ) during the period of the study . This paper presents preliminary data from a small observational study in Argentina which represents the first database in our country .
