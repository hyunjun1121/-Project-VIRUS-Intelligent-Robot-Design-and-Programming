DB09302 : Q8NBP7 inhibitor for LDL cholesterol reduction . The proof of concept that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) inhibition affects cholesterol levels was first established after the demonstration that Q8NBP7 loss-of-function mutations result in a significant drop in circulating LDL cholesterol levels . Subsequent studies revealed that Q8NBP7 binds the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain-A on the surface LDL Receptor ( P01130 ) and directs P01130 and Q8NBP7 for lysosomal degradation . DB09302 ( also known as SAR236553/REGN727 ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds circulating Q8NBP7 and blocks its interactions with surface P01130 . DB09302 clinical trials with different doses on different administration schedules were shown to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol both as a mono-therapy and in combination with statins or ezetimibe . Although there is great potential for anti- Q8NBP7 therapies in the management of cholesterol metabolism , there is no clear evidence yet that blocking Q8NBP7 reduces cardiovascular disease outcome . This is being investigated in ongoing Phase III clinical trials with alirocumab .
