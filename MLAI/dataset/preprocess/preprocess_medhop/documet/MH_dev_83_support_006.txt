Compositions for treatment of cancer and inflammation . Celecoxib ( DB00482 , Pfizer , NY , USA ) is a worldwide top branded P35354 -specific inhibitor . It was shown to provide relief of arthritic pain and inflammation and has recently been under investigation for the prevention and treatment of cancer . However , recent studies showed that long term use of high doses of celecoxib is associated with an increased cardiovascular toxicity . We discovered that the addition of curcumin , a natural P35354 inhibitor , to celecoxib synergistically ( up to 1000 % ) augments the growth inhibitory effects of celecoxib in in-vitro and in-vivo models of arthritis and cancer , thus rendering effective action of the drug at up to tenfold lower dose . This may pave the way for a novel strategy to treat arthritis and cancer because its effect [ 1 ] can be achieved in the serum of patients receiving standard anti inflammatory or anti-neoplastic dosages of celecoxib , and [ 2 ] involves a regimen with a very low profile of side effects . Preliminary data suggest that the combination is not limited only to celecoxib and that addition of curcumin to other NSAIDs such as sulindac , synergistically augments neoplastic cell growth inhibition . Based on these finding we received an IRB approval to evaluate celecoxib+curcumin in patients with osteoarthritis , pancreatic cancer and metastatic CRC . We hope to complete these novel human clinical trials , in 12-18 months .
