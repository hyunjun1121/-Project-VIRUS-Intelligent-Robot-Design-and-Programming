Effects of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine incorporation on elongation of specific DNA sequences by P06746 . DB00987 ( ara-C ) is an effective antileukemic agent which acts as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis . The precise mechanism responsible for this inhibitory effect , however , remains unclear . The present work has examined the effects of the triphosphate derivative , ara- P53007 , on purified P06746 . These studies were performed on M13 phage DNA templates of defined sequence . The results demonstrate that ara-C is incorporated into DNA by P06746 . The results also demonstrate that the incorporated ara-C residue acts as a relative chain terminator . Moreover , the relative chain terminating effects of ara-C are sequence specific . In this regard , DNA strand elongation was progressively slowed at sequences of two , three , and four contiguous sites for cytosine incorporation . We also demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of ara-C are reversed by competition with deoxycytidine-triphosphate for incorporation into the DNA strand . Taken together , these findings are consistent with structural differences of the incorporated arabinosyl moiety which alter reactivity of the 3'-terminus and thereby inhibit chain elongation . These findings also provide new insights regarding the inhibitory effects of ara-C on elongation of specific DNA sequences .
