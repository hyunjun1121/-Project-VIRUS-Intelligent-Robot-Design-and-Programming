A phase I study of cabozantinib ( DB05153 ) in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer . BACKGROUND : DB08875 targets tyrosine kinases including MET , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) receptor 2 , and rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) is a tumor type that may be sensitive to cabozantinib . Therefore , we evaluated cabozantinib in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients with metastatic DTC . METHODS : This single-arm open-label phase I trial assessed the safety , tolerability , and antitumor activity of cabozantinib in DTC patients taking part in a drug-drug interaction study . Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or surgically unresectable DTC ( including papillary , follicular , or HÃ¼rthle cell ) were enrolled . Patients received daily oral dosing of 140 mg cabozantinib . Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events ( AEs ) , vital signs , electrocardiograms , laboratory tests , and concomitant medications . Tumor response by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan was investigator assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.0 . RESULTS : The study enrolled 15 patients who had failed standard radioactive iodine therapy . Patients had received a median of two prior systemic agents , and 11 patients ( 73 % ) had previously received at least one P15692 pathway inhibiting therapy . Common AEs included diarrhea , nausea , fatigue , and decreased appetite . Partial response was reported in eight patients ( 53 % ) . Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were not reached . CONCLUSIONS : DB08875 demonstrates a safety profile similar to other multitargeted VEGFR inhibitors in advanced DTC patients . The antitumor activity observed in this study warrants further investigation of cabozantinib in patients with advanced DTC .
