A phase I pharmacokinetic study of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with P00533 -expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer . DB05101 is a humanized IgG1 P00533 monoclonal antibody . This phase I study investigated the tolerability , safety and pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of matuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with P00533 -expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Six dose levels/schedules of matuzumab were explored in combination with paclitaxel . Dose was escalated from 100 mg to 1,600 mg on a modified Fibonacci scheme according to the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) over the first two cycles . DLT was assessed in patients who completed the first two treatment cycles or who stopped treatment because of a DLT during those cycles . Patients with non-progressive disease could then continue to receive study treatment for up to 6 months . The safety population comprised 44 patients , with DLT evaluable in 33 . The maximum tolerated dose was not reached , with only one DLT reported at the 1,600 mg 3-weekly dose level . The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events across all cycles were dyspnea ( 23 % ) and neutropenia ( 11 % ) . DB05101 exhibited non-linear PK , with accumulation after escalation and repeated dosing . Tumor growth control was seen in 15/44 ( 34 % ) patients , including 5/9 ( 56 % ) at the 800 mg weekly dose level . DB05101 combined with paclitaxel was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC . There was some evidence of anticancer activity in relation to the matuzumab 800 mg weekly dose .
