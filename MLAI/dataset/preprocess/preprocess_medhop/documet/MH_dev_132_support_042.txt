[ An effect of perindopril on the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in peripheral blood in the acute period of atherothrombotic ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction ] . Twenty-nine patients with acute atherothrombotic ischemic stroke and 36 patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarction have been studied . Each group has been stratified into 2 subgroups : patients of subgroups A received an P12821 inhibitor perindopril in the complex therapy from the 1st day of disease . Patients of subgroups B were not assigned to this drug . Along with routine tests , the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) measured with ELISA using test-systems ( Q02223 Diagnostics , USA ) and reagents ( R & D , England ) have been determined . The administration of perindopril did not cause side-effects , including arterial hypotonia after the first dosage , in patients in the acute period of atherothrombotic ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction . DB00790 may decrease the activity of P14780 in these patients and produces an anticytokine effect . Some similar mechanisms of ischemic lesions of the heart and the brain and a commonness of biochemical " response " to the same medical intervention ( the administration of an P12821 inhibitor perindopril ) in patients of both groups were found . The results support the pathogenetic validity of perindopril therapy in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
