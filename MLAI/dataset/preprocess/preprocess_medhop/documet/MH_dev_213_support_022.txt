Signaling and antiproliferative effects mediated by DB00644 receptors after expression in breast cancer cells using recombinant adenovirus . DB00644 receptors ( DB00644 -Rs ) are found in human cancers , including those of the breast , and DB00644 can inhibit the growth of cell lines derived from such cancers . Although pituitary and extrapituitary P30968 transcripts appear identical , their functional characteristics may differ . Most extrapituitary DB00644 -Rs have low affinity for DB00644 analogs and may not activate P98160 or discriminate between agonists and antagonists in the same way as pituitary DB00644 -Rs . Here we have assessed whether DB00644 -Rs expressed exogenously in breast cancer cells differ from those in gonadotropes . We found no evidence for endogenous DB00644 -Rs in MCF7 cells , but after infection with adenovirus expressing the P30968 ( Ad P30968 ) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 or greater , at least 80 % expressed DB00644 -Rs . These had high affinity ( K(d) for [(125)I]buserelin , 1.4 nM ) and specificity ( rank order of potency , buserelin > DB00644 >> chicken DB00644 -II ) and mediated stimulation of [(3)H]IP accumulation . Increasing viral titer [ from multiplicity of infection , 3-300 ] increased receptor number ( 10,000-225,000 sites/cell ) and [(3)H]IP responses . DB00644 stimulated P28482 phosphorylation in Ad P30968 -infected cells , and this effect , like stimulation of [(3)H]IP accumulation , was blocked by P30968 antagonists . DB00644 also inhibited [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into Ad P30968 -infected cells ( but not control cells ) . This effect was mimicked by agonist analogs and inhibited by two antagonists . Thus , when exogenous DB00644 -Rs are expressed at density comparable to that in gonadotropes , they are functionally indistinguishable from the endogenous DB00644 -Rs in gonadotropes , and increasing expression of high affinity DB00644 -Rs can dramatically enhance the direct antiproliferative effect of DB00644 agonists on breast cancer cells .
