Exendin-4 stimulates islet cell replication via the IGF1 receptor activation of mTORC1/ P23443 . P43220 ( P43220 ) agonists , such as exendin-4 , potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and are currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes . Interestingly , P43220 agonists also have the ability to augment β-cell mass . In this report , we provide evidence that in the presence of glucose , exendin-4 stimulates rodent islet cell DNA replication via the activation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 ( P23443 ) and that this is mediated by the protein kinase B ( P31749 ) -dependent activation of P42345 complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) . We show that activation of this pathway is caused by the autocrine or paracrine activation of the IGF1 receptor ( P08069 ) , as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the P08069 effectively blocked exendin-4-stimulated P31749 and mTORC1 activation . In contrast , pharmacological inactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor has no discernible effect on exendin-4-stimulated P31749 or mTORC1 activation . Therefore , we conclude that P43220 agonists stimulate β-cell proliferation via the P31749 -dependent stimulation of mTORC1/ P23443 whose activation is mediated through the autocrine/paracrine activation of the P08069 . This work provides a better understanding of the molecular basis of GLP1 agonist-induced β-cell proliferation which could potentially be exploited in the identification of novel drug targets that increase β-cell mass .
