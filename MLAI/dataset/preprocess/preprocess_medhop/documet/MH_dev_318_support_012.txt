Deliberate self-harm is associated with allelic variation in the tryptophan hydroxylase gene ( P17752 A779C ) , but not with polymorphisms in five other serotonergic genes . BACKGROUND : There is a heritable component to suicidal behaviour , encouraging the search for the associated risk alleles . Given the putative role of the 5-HT ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; serotonin ) system in suicidal behaviour , serotonergic genes are leading candidates . In particular , several studies have reported an association with variants in the tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) gene . METHOD : We studied six serotonergic gene polymorphisms in a well-characterized sample of 129 deliberate self-harm subjects and 329 comparison subjects . The polymorphisms were P17752 ( A779C ) , 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT , LPR S/L ) , monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 G941T ) , P28222 receptor ( P28222 G861C ) , 5- Q13049 receptor ( P28223 T102C ) , and P28335 receptor ( P28335 Cys23Ser ) . Genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based assays . The primary analyses compared allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls . There were a limited number of planned secondary analyses within the deliberate self-harm group . RESULTS : The P17752 A779 allele was more common in deliberate self-harm subjects than in controls ( OR 1.38 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.88 ; P = 0.03 ) . None of the other polymorphisms was associated with deliberate self-harm . Within the deliberate self-harm group there were no associations with impulsivity , suicide risk , lifetime history of depression , or family history of deliberate self-harm . CONCLUSIONS : Our data extend the evidence that allelic variation in the P17752 gene is a risk factor for deliberate self-harm . No evidence was found to implicate the other polymorphisms .
