The P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin reduces drug-induced dyskinesia in O75916 -deficient mice . Drug-induced dyskinesia is a major complication of dopamine replacement therapy in advanced Parkinson 's disease consisting of dystonia , chorea and athetosis . Agonists at P08908 -receptors attenuate levodopa-induced motor complications in non-human primates . Mice with increased dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) signalling due to the lack of expression of the regulator of G-protein signalling 9 ( O75916 ) also develop dyskinesia following levodopa treatment . We investigated whether the P08908 -receptor agonist flibanserin compared with buspirone reduces motor abnormalities induced by levodopa or quinelorane , a selective dopamine D2-receptor agonist . Following dopamine depletion via reserpine , 40 mice ( 20 wild-type and 20 O75916 knock-out ) were treated with flibanserin or buspirone in combination with levodopa or quinelorane . Motor behaviour was analysed using open field analysis . O75916 knock-out mice displayed significantly more drug-induced dystonia ( p < 0.04 ; t test ) than wild type . In quinelorane-treated wild-type mice flibanserin as well as buspirone significantly reduced dystonia ( p < 0.05 ) . In O75916 knock-out animals again both reduced quinelorane-induced dystonia . However , flibanserin was significantly more effective ( p = 0.003 ) . Following reserpine pretreatment and administration of levodopa wild-type and Q99697 9 knock-out mice showed mild to moderate dystonia . Surprisingly , 10 mg/kg buspirone increased dystonia in both animal groups , whereas it was decreased by 10 mg/kg flibanserin . However , compared with levodopa alone only the increase of dystonia by buspirone was significant ( p < 0.04 ) . DB04908 showed promising antidyskinetic effects in a model of drug-induced dyskinesia . Our data underline the possible benefit of P08908 agonists in drug-induced dyskinesia .
