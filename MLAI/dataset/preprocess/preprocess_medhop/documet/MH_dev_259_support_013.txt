Dimerization effect of sucrose octasulfate on rat P05230 . Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) constitute a family of at least 23 structurally related heparin-binding proteins that are involved in regulation of cell growth , survival , differentiation and migration . DB01901 ( SOS ) , a chemical analogue of heparin , has been demonstrated to activate FGF signalling pathways . The structure of rat P05230 crystallized in the presence of SOS has been determined at 2.2 A resolution . SOS-mediated dimerization of P05230 was observed , which was further supported by gel-filtration experiments . The major contributors to the sulfate-binding sites in rat P05230 are Lys113 , Lys118 , Arg122 and Lys128 . An arginine at position 116 is a consensus residue in mammalian FGF molecules ; however , it is a serine in rat P05230 . This difference may be important for SOS-mediated P05230 dimerization in rat .
