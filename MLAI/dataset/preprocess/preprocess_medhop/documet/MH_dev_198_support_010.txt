P06396 as a negative prognostic factor and effector of motility in erbB-2-positive epidermal growth factor receptor-positive breast cancers . PURPOSE : erbB-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) may mediate motility via signaling that enables changes in the actin cytoskeleton . A physical basis for this motility may depend on the coexpression of gelsolin , a M(r) 80,000 actin-binding protein . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The expression of erbB-2 , P00533 , and gelsolin was analyzed in 790 archival invasive breast cancers . These data were compared with histological , clinical , and outcome data ( median follow-up , 16.3 years ) . RESULTS : Protein overexpression was observed in overlapping subsets of breast cancers ( 38 % of cases were erbB-2+ ; 15 % of cases were P00533 + ; and 56 % of cases were gelsolin+ ) . Tumor gelsolin was associated with overexpression of erbB-2 and P00533 , as well as with an aggressive tumor phenotype . By univariate and multivariate analyses , tumor gelsolin alone was not a prognostic factor . Overexpression of all three factors significantly predicted poor clinical outcome by univariate and multivariate analyses . For example , in node-positive patients , coexpression of all three markers was associated with a 3-year disease-specific survival ( as compared with erbB-2+ , P00533 + , gelsolin- patients , who had a median survival of 6 years ) . CONCLUSIONS : These data suggest that gelsolin coexpression may be an important additional prognostic factor in erbB-2+ , P00533 + breast cancer patients . We hypothesize that this is due to the role of gelsolin in mediating motility and invasion .
