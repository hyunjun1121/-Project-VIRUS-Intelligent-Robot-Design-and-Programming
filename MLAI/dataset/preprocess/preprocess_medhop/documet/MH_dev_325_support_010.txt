P06858 ( P06858 ) is associated with neurite pathology and its levels are markedly reduced in the dentate gyrus of Alzheimer 's disease brains . P06858 ( P06858 ) is involved in regulation of fatty acid metabolism , and facilitates cellular uptake of lipoproteins , lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins . We evaluated P06858 distribution in healthy and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain tissue and its relative levels in cerebrospinal fluid . P06858 immunostaining is widely present in different neuronal subgroups , microglia , astrocytes and oligodendroglia throughout cerebrum , cerebellum and spinal cord . P06858 immunoreactivity is also present in leptomeninges , small blood vessels , choroid plexus and ependymal cells , Schwann cells associated with cranial nerves , and in anterior and posterior pituitary . In vitro studies have shown presence of secreted P06858 in conditioned media of human cortical neuronal cell line ( Q9UL51 ) and neuroblastoma cells ( SK-N-SH ) , but not in media of cultured primary human astrocytes . P06858 was present in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of neuronal cells and astrocytes in vitro . P06858 immunoreactivity strongly associates with AD-related pathology , staining diffuse plaques , dystrophic and swollen neurites , possible Hirano bodies and activated glial cells . We observed no staining associated with neurofibrillary tangles or granulovacuolar degeneration . Granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the associated synaptic network showed significantly reduced staining in AD compared to control tissue . P06858 was also reduced in AD P04141 samples relative to those in controls .
