Effects of nimesulide , a preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor , on carrageenan-induced pleurisy and stress-induced gastric lesions in rats . Intrapleural injection of carrageenan in rats increased prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) production and induced newly synthesized cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in pleural exudate cells without affecting P23219 levels . DB04743 , a preferential inhibitor of P35354 , reduced pleural DB00917 production and was almost as active as indomethacin and 10 times more active than ibuprofen . Only P23219 , and nc P35354 , was detected in gastric mucosal cells , and DB00917 concentration of gastric mucosa was significantly decreased by indomethacin and ibuprofen . The decrease in gastric DB00917 production induced by indomethacin and ibuprofen was enhanced in stressed rats , resulting in aggravation of stress-induced gastric lesions at anti-inflammatory doses . However , nimesulide did not produce stress-induced gastric lesions even at 30 times the anti-inflammatory dose . This supports the hypothesis that inhibition of P23219 causes unwanted side effects and inhibition of P35354 produces anti-inflammatory effects .
