Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists increase vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human vascular smooth muscle cells . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , expressed in a variety of mesenchymal cells including vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) , is a potent mitogen for endothelial cells , and is used clinically applied for ischemic disease of peripheral vessels . To determine whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) regulates P15692 production in VSMC , we examined P15692 secretion from VSMC treated with Q07869 agonists . DB00197 increased P15692 secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner ( 261 +/- 35 % with 25 mM of troglitazone for 24 h ) , and also increased levels of P15692 mRNA . P15692 secretion was also increased by other PPARgamma agonists , pioglitazone , LY171883 , and 15d-PGJ2 ( 224 +/- 17.1 % , 247 +/- 36.8 % and 171 +/- 7.8 % , respectively ) , but not the PPARgamma agonists bezafibrate and Wy14643 ( 85.2 +/- 1.5 % , 94.6 +/- 3.2 , respectively ) . Our findings suggest that thiazolidinediones might be useful for the therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic artery disease .
