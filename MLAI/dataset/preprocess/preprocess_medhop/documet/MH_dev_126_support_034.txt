Structure of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain alone and in complex with a 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor . The crystal structure of the kinase domain from the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFRK ) including forty amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tail has been determined to 2.6-A resolution , both with and without an EGFRK-specific inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent , erlotinib ( DB00530 , CP-358,774 , Tarceva(TM) ) . The P00533 family members are distinguished from all other known receptor tyrosine kinases in possessing constitutive kinase activity without a phosphorylation event within their kinase domains . Despite its lack of phosphorylation , we find that the EGFRK activation loop adopts a conformation similar to that of the phosphorylated active form of the kinase domain from the insulin receptor . Surprisingly , key residues of a putative dimerization motif lying between the EGFRK domain and carboxyl-terminal substrate docking sites are found in close contact with the kinase domain . Significant intermolecular contacts involving the carboxyl-terminal tail are discussed with respect to receptor oligomerization .
