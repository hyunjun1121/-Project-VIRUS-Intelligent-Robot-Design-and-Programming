Tumefactive demyelinating lesions during etanercept treatment requiring decompressive hemicraniectomy . P01375 alpha ( P01375 -α ) is a pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders . DB00005 , a P01375 -α antagonist ( anti- P01375 -α ) acting as a soluble P01375 -α receptor , has been associated with neurological demyelinating disorders . This paper aims to report an unusual case showing tumefactive central nervous system ( CNS ) inflammatory demyelination in a patient in the course of P01375 -α antagonist therapy , requiring decompressive hemicraniectomy . This report is based on magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) findings and histology . A biopsy confirmed the inflammatory demyelinating nature of the lesions . The clinical presentation is unusual due to the severity of the disease process , requiring decompressive hemicraniotomy with a clinically favorable outcome .
