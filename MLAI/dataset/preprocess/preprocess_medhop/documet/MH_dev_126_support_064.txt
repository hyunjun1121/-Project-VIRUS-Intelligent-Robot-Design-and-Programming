Rationale and clinical validation of epidermal growth factor receptor as a target in the treatment of head and neck cancer . Recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer is an area of high , unmet treatment need . There is a strong rationale for targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) in head and neck cancer as most of these tumors express high levels of P00533 relative to normal tissue , with high expression correlating with poor patient outcome . This rationale has been validated in extensive preclinical studies . Two small molecules with P00533 inhibitory activity , gefitinib ( ' DB00317 ' , ZD1839 ) and erlotinib ( ' Tarceva ' , DB00530 ) , and a humanized monoclonal antibody against the P00533 extracellular domain , cetuximab ( ' Erbitux ' , C225 ) , are in clinical trials for advanced head and neck cancer . The initial results of these trials are promising . Gefitinib and erlotinib show activity as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer , and have an acceptable safety profile compared with conventional chemotherapy . Gefitinib , which can be given at doses below the maximum tolerated dose , is associated with slightly lower rates of adverse events than erlotinib , which is dosed at the maximum tolerated dose . Combinations of cetuximab with radiotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown activity in phase I/II studies . Both gefitinib and cetuximab have entered phase III studies . The results of these trials , which will mature over the next few years , will help determine the optimal use of P00533 agents in head and neck cancers .
