Generation and properties of a new human ventral mesencephalic neural stem cell line . Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are powerful research tools for the design and discovery of new approaches to cell therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson 's disease . Several epigenetic and genetic strategies have been tested for long-term maintenance and expansion of these cells in vitro . Here we report the generation of a new stable cell line of human neural stem cells derived from ventral mesencephalon ( hVM1 ) based on v-myc immortalization . The cells expressed neural stem cell and radial glia markers like nestin , vimentin and 3CB2 under proliferation conditions . After withdrawal of growth factors , proliferation and expression of v-myc were dramatically reduced and the cells differentiated into astrocytes , oligodendrocytes and neurons . hVM1 cells yield a large number of dopaminergic neurons ( about 12 % of total cells are TH+ ) after differentiation , which also produce dopamine . In addition to proneural genes ( Q9H2A3 , MASH1 ) , differentiated cells show expression of several genuine mesencephalic dopaminergic markers such as : Q8TE12 , O60663 , P48051 , P00325 , P43354 , O75364 , Q05940 and Q01959 , indicating that they retain their regional identity . Our data indicate that this cell line and its clonal derivatives may constitute good candidates for the study of development and physiology of human dopaminergic neurons in vitro , and to develop tools for Parkinson 's disease cell replacement preclinical research and drug testing .
