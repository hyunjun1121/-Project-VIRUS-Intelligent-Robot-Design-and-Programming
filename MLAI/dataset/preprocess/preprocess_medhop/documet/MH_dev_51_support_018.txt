Biological effects of alpha particle radiation exposure on human monocytic cells . Radon ( (222)Rn ) gas produces decay progeny that emits high energy alpha (α)-particles . Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to (222)Rn is linked with elevated risk of developing lung cancer , however clear mechanisms leading to such effects have not been delineated . Cytokines play a critical role in inflammation and their dysregulated production often contributes to disease pathogenesis . In this study , Bio-plex multiplex technology was employed to investigate modulations of 27 pro-inflammatory cytokines following exposure of human monocytic cells to 1.5 Gy of α-particle radiation . Concurrently , DNA damage was assessed by examining the formation of phosphorylated H2A histone family X ( γ- P16104 ) sites . Of the 27 cytokines assessed , 4 cytokines were shown to be statistically downregulated by ∼2 fold relative to the untreated controls and included the interleukin ( IL ) family of proteins ( P60568 , P40933 and Q16552 ) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta ( MIP-1b ) . Interferon-inducible protein-12 ( IP-12 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) were shown to be high expressors and upregulated . Cells irradiated with α-particles ranging from 0.27 to 2.14 Gy showed statistically significant , dose-dependant increases in γ- P16104 formation . These data suggest that α-particle radiation causes dysregulation in the production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and results in significant DNA damage .
