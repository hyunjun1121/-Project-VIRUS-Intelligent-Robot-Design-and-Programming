Cordycepin suppresses P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation by reducing p65 transcriptional activity , inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation , and blocking IKKγ ubiquitination . Cordycepin is reported to participate in multiple pharmacological activities including anti-tumor and anti-inflammation , and is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway . However , the detailed molecular mechanism of cordycepin in suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway remains ambiguous . In this study , we first analyzed the effect of cordycepin on NF-κB activity in P29320 -293T cells , and found that cordycepin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in P01375 -α-induced NF-κB activation . Although cordycepin did not block P01375 -α-induced nuclear translocation of p65 , high concentration of cordycepin reduced the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of NF-κB . Moreover , cordycepin also inhibited IκBα phosphorylation so as to suppress the degradation of IκBα . Further investigation revealed that cordycepin suppressed IKKs-mediated NF-κB activation and inhibited the ubiquitination of IKKγ . In conclusion , cordycepin effectively inhibits NF-κB signaling through suppressing the activities of NF-κB , IκB and IKK . Thus , cordycepin may provide some potential therapeutic application in inflammation-associated disorders and cancer .
