[ Meloxicam ( DB00814 ) : a review of its pharmacological and clinical profile ] . Meloxicam ( DB00814 ) is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) derived from enolic acid , exhibiting selectivity for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 over P23219 . Meloxicam has shown potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity together with low gastrointestinal toxicity in animal models . It is a potent inhibitor not only of acute exudation in adjuvant arthritis in the rat , but also of bone and cartilage destruction . The therapeutic range of meloxicam in the rat , with regard to inhibition of adjuvant arthritis , was several times greater than that of other NSAIDs . Meloxicam in therapeutic doses was found to have no effect on bleeding time or platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers . In clinical studies , meloxicam has shown reliable efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis , lumbago ( low back pain ) , scapulohumeral periarthritis , and neck-shoulder-arm syndrome with low gastrointestinal toxicity .
