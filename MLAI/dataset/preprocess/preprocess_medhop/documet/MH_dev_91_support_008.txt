Novel DNA-binding properties of the RNA-binding protein TIAR . P31483 related protein binds avidly to uridine-rich elements in mRNA and pre-mRNAs of a wide range of genes , including interleukin ( IL ) -8 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . The protein has diverse regulatory roles , which in part depend on the locus of binding within the transcript , including translational control , splicing and apoptosis . Here , we observed selective and potent inhibition of TIAR- Q96LT9 complex formation with P10145 and P15692 3'-untranslated regions ( 3'-UTRs ) using thymidine-rich deoxyoligonucleotide ( ODN ) sequences derived from the VEFG 3'-UTR . We show by ultraviolet crosslinking and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that TIAR can bind directly to single-stranded , thymidine-rich ODNs but not to double-stranded ODNs containing the same sequence . TIAR had a nearly 6-fold greater affinity for DNA than RNA ( K(d)app = 1.6x10(-9) M versus 9.4 x 10(-9) M ) . Truncation of TIAR indicated that the high affinity DNA-binding site overlaps with the RNA-binding site involving RNA recognition motif 2 ( P31350 ) . However , P23921 alone could also bind to DNA . Finally , we show that TIAR can be displaced from single-stranded DNA by active transcription through the binding site . These results provide a potential mechanism by which TIAR can shuttle between RNA and DNA ligands .
