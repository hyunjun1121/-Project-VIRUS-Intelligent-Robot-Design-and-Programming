P10828 mutants : Dominant negative regulators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma action . Thyroid hormone ( DB00279 ) and peroxisome proliferators have overlapping metabolic effects in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis . Their actions are mediated by their respective receptors : thyroid hormone receptors ( TR ) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( Q07869 ) . We recently found that a dominantly negative TRbeta mutant ( PV ) that causes a genetic disease , resistance to thyroid hormone , acts to repress the ligand (troglitazone)-mediated transcriptional activity of PPARgamma in cultured thyroid cells . This finding suggests that TRbeta mutants could crosstalk with PPARgamma-signaling pathways . The present study explored the molecular mechanisms by which PV represses the PPARgamma transcriptional activity . Gel-shift assays show that the PV , similar to wild-type TRbeta , bound to the peroxisome proliferator response element ( PPRE ) as homodimers and heterodimers with PPARgamma or the retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) , thereby competing with PPARgamma for binding to PPRE and for sequestering RXR . Association of PPRE-bound PV with corepressors [ e.g. , nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) ] that led to transcriptional repression was independent of DB00279 and troglitazone . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further demonstrated that , despite the presence of ligands , NCoR was recruited to PPRE-bound PV on a PPARgamma-target gene , the lipoprotein lipase , in vivo , suggesting the dominant action of PV on PPARgamma-mediated transcriptional activity . Thus , the dominant negative action of PV is not limited on the wild-type TRs . The findings that TRbeta mutants affect PPARgamma functions through dominant negative action provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TR regulates the PPARgamma-target genes involved in metabolic pathways , lipid homeostasis , and carcinogenesis .
