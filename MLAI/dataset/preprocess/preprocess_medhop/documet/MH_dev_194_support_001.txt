Population pharmacokinetic study of memantine : effects of clinical and genetic factors . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Memantine , a frequently prescribed anti-dementia drug , is mainly eliminated unchanged by the kidneys , partly via tubular secretion . Considerable inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations has been reported . We aimed to investigate clinical and genetic factors influencing memantine disposition . METHODS : A population pharmacokinetic study was performed including data from 108 patients recruited in a naturalistic setting . Patients were genotyped for common polymorphisms in renal cation transporters ( O15245 /2/5 , Q96FL8 , P08183 ) and nuclear receptors ( O75469 , Q14994 , RXR , Q07869 ) involved in transporter expression . RESULTS : The average clearance was 5.2 L/h with a 27 % inter-individual variability ( percentage coefficient of variation ) . Glomerular filtration rate ( p = 0.007 ) and sex ( p = 0.001 ) markedly influenced memantine clearance . O75469 rs1523130 was identified as the unique significant genetic covariate for memantine clearance ( p = 0.006 ) , with carriers of the O75469 rs1523130 CT/TT genotypes presenting a 16 % slower memantine elimination than carriers of the CC genotype . CONCLUSION : The better understanding of inter-individual variability of memantine disposition might be beneficial in the context of individual dose optimization .
