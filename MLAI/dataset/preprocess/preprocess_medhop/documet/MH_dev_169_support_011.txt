Factor XIIIa binding to activated platelets is mediated through activation of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa . Stabilization of a clot is dependent on fibrin cross-linking mediated by the transglutaminase , factor XIIIa ( FXIIIa ) . In addition to fibrin stabilization , FXIIIa acts on a number of platelet-reactive proteins , including fibronectin and vitronectin , as well as the platelet proteins , glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb-IIIa , myosin , and actin . However , conditions inducing the platelet-activation dependent binding of FXIIIa have not been characterized nor have the sites mediating FXIIIa binding been identified . The generation of FXIIIa and consequent detection of FXIIIa on the platelet surface were compared with other thrombin-induced activation events ; the rate at which FXIIIa bound to activated platelets was much slower than platelet degranulation or fibrin(ogen) binding . Whereas platelets could be rapidly induced to express a functional receptor for FXIIIa , the rate of FXIIIa binding to platelets is limited by the rate of conversion of FXIII to FXIIIa . Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled platelets using polyclonal anti-FXIII A-chain antibody identified two proteins corresponding to P08514 and P05106 . Preincubation of intact platelets with DB00054 , a monoclonal antibody that blocks the fibrinogen binding site , or GRGDSP peptide inhibited FXIIIa binding by about 95 % when measured by flow cytometry ; FXIIIa binding to purified P08514 -IIIa was also inhibited by DB00054 . The binding of FXIIIa to purified P08514 -IIIa was enhanced by the addition of fibrinogen , but not by that of fibronectin or thrombospondin , suggesting that FXIIIa also binds to fibrinogen associated with the complex . These observations suggest that activated platelets bearing FXIIIa may enhance stabilization of platelet-rich thrombi through surface-localized cross-linking events .
