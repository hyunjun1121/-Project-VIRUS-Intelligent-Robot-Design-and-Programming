Genotoxicity and induction of DNA damage responsive genes by food-borne heterocyclic aromatic amines in human hepatoma HepG2 cells . Heterocyclic aromatic amines ( HAAs ) are potential human carcinogens formed in well-done meats and fish . The most abundant are 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline ( MeIQx ) , 2-Amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline ( 4,8-DiMeIQx ) and 2-Amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline ( IQ ) . HAAs exert genotoxic activity after metabolic transformation by CYP1A enzymes , that is well characterized , however the genomic and intervening responses are not well explored . We have examined cellular and genomic responses of human hepatoma HepG2 cells after 24h exposure to HAAs . Comet assay revealed increase in formation of DNA strand breaks by PhIP , MeIQx and IQ but not 4,8-DiMeIQx , whereas increased formation of micronuclei was not observed . The four HAAs up-regulated expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes P04798 , P05177 and P22309 and expression of P04637 and its downstream regulated genes P38936 , GADD45α and Q07812 . Consistent with the up-regulation of P38936 and GADD45α the cell-cycle analysis showed arrest in S-phase by PhIP and IQ , and in P55008 -phase by 4,8-DiMeIQx and MeIQx . The results indicate that upon exposure to HAAs the cells respond with the cell-cycle arrest , which enables cells to repair the damage or eliminate them by apoptosis . However , elevated expression of P10415 and down-regulation of Q07812 may indicate that HAAs could suppress apoptosis meaning higher probability of damaged cells to survive and mutate .
