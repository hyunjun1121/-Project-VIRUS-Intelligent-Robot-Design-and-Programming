P42345 mediates human trophoblast invasion through regulation of matrix-remodeling enzymes and is associated with serine phosphorylation of P40763 . The intracellular signaling molecule mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) is essential for cell growth and proliferation . It is involved in mouse embryogenesis , murine trophoblast outgrowth and linked to tumor cell invasiveness . In order to assess the role of P42345 in human trophoblast invasion we analyzed the in vitro invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo immortalized first-trimester trophoblast cells in conjunction with enzyme secretion upon P42345 inhibition and knockdown of P42345 protein expression . Additionally , we also tested the capability of P42345 to trigger signal transducer and activator of transcription ( P35610 ) -3 by its phosphorylation status . DB00877 inhibited P42345 kinase activity as demonstrated with a lower phosphorylation level of the P42345 substrate P08133 S6 kinase ( S6K ) . With the use of rapamycin and siRNA-mediated P42345 knockdown we could show that cell proliferation , invasion and secretion of matrix-metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -2 and -9 , urokinase-like plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its major physiological uPA inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 were inhibited . While tyrosine phosphorylation of P40763 was unaffected by P42345 inhibition and knockdown , serine phosphorylation was diminished . We conclude that P42345 signaling is one major mechanism in a tightly regulated network of intracellular signal pathways including the JAK/ P35610 system to regulate invasion in human trophoblast cells by secretion of enzymes that remodel the extra-cellular matrix ( Q13201 ) such as P08253 , -9 , uPA and P05121 . Dysregulation of P42345 may contribute to pregnancy-related pathologies caused through impaired trophoblast invasion .
