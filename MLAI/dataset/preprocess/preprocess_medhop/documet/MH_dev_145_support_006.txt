P25116 genotype influences platelet aggregation and procoagulant responses in patients with coronary artery disease prior to and during clopidogrel therapy . Genetic variations of the protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) have been associated with platelet receptor density and linked to thrombin receptor-activating peptide ( TRAP ) -induced phenotypes of platelet aggregation and P16109 expression . We investigated whether the P25116 intervening sequence-14 A > T dimorphism influences platelet procoagulant activity . We also determined whether the Q9H244 antagonist clopidogrel could offset any observed functional polymorphism of the P25116 receptor by inhibiting Q9H244 -mediated amplification of TRAP-induced responses . We studied 54 patients listed for elective percutaneous coronary intervention assessing TRAP-induced platelet aggregation and markers of procoagulant activity . Platelet responses were measured at baseline , 4 h post clopidogrel 300 mg , and 10 and 28 days following clopidogrel 75 mg daily . Each patient was genotyped for the P25116 intervening sequence-14 A/T dimorphism . Increased platelet aggregation and procoagulant responses were observed with P25116 A allele homozygotes . DB00758 significantly inhibited these platelet responses regardless of P25116 genotype , but did not offset the hyper-reactivity associated with the A/A homozygotes . We conclude that a common sequence variation within the P25116 gene influences TRAP-induced platelet procoagulant activity as well as aggregation . Higher platelet reactivity associated with P25116 IVSn-14 A allele homozygotes persists despite clopidogrel therapy . These individuals may be at higher risk of thromboembolic events and may require additional anti-platelet medication .
