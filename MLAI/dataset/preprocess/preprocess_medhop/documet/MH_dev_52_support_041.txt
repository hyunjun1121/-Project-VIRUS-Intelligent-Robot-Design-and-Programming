Protein kinase C-delta mediates P04275 secretion from endothelial cells in response to vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) but not histamine . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and histamine induce P04275 ( P04275 ) release from vascular endothelial cells . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) is involved in the control of exocytosis in many secretory cell types . OBJECTIVES : We investigated the role of PKC and the interactions between PKC and Ca2+ signaling in both P15692 -induced and histamine-induced P04275 secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . RESULTS : Several PKC inhibitors ( staurosporine , Ro31-8220 , myristoylated PKC peptide inhibitor and Go6983 ) block P15692 -induced but not histamine-induced P04275 secretion . P17252 and novel PKCs ( PKC-delta , PKC-epsilon , and PKC-eta ) , but not P05771 , are expressed in HUVECs . Both P15692 and histamine activate PKC-delta . However , gene inactivation experiments using small interfering RNA indicate that PKC-delta ( but not P17252 ) is involved in the regulation of P15692 -induced but not histamine-induced secretion . Both P15692 and histamine induce a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ ( [Ca2+]c ) , but the response to P15692 is weaker and even absent in a significant subset of cells . Furthermore , P15692 -induced secretion is largely preserved when the rise in [Ca2+]c is prevented by BAPTA-AM . CONCLUSIONS : Our study identifies striking agonist specificities in signal-secretion coupling . DB11320 -induced secretion is dependent on [Ca2+]c but not PKC , whereas P15692 -induced secretion is largely dependent on PKC-delta and significantly less on [Ca2+]c . Our data firmly establish the key role of PKC-delta in P15692 -induced P04275 release , but suggest that a third , P15692 -specific , signaling intermediate is required as a PKC-delta coactivator .
