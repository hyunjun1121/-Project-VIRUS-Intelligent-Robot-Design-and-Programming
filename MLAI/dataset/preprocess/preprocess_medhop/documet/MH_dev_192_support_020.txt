Cyclophosphamide and other new agents for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia . Severe aplastic anemia ( P0DJI8 ) has a poor prognosis in the absence of treatment . Current accepted therapeutic strategies include allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and immunosuppression , both resulting in long-term survival in the majority of patients . Although human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling stem-cell transplantation is highly effective , the 25 % probability of finding a suitable sibling donor within a family renders this approach available to only a minority of patients . Transplantation using HLA-matched , unrelated donors carries a high risk of treatment failure along with considerable toxicity . While combined immunosuppression with both antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) and cyclosporine A ( Q13216 ) produces hematologic improvement in most patients , relapse is common . Late evolution of aplastic anemia to other serious hematologic disorders , including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) , myelodysplasia , and acute leukemia , is also a significant problem following treatment with ATG/ Q13216 . Recently , results of immunosuppression in P0DJI8 with another potent immunosuppressive agent , cyclophosphamide , were reported in a small number of patients . The overall response rate was similar to that seen with ATG/ Q13216 , but relapse and late clonal disease were not observed during a long period of follow-up . A larger randomized trial comparing sustained hematologic response rates to either conventional immunosuppression with ATG/ Q13216 or high-dose cyclophosphamide and Q13216 is now underway ; secondary end points include response duration , event-free survival , and overall survival . Additionally , a number of protocols designed to test the efficacy of alternative immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents are being developed .
