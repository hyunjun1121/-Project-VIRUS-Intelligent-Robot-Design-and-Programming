The role of matrix metalloproteinase in the intimal sarcoma-like cells derived from endarterectomized tissues from a chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patient . Sarcoma-like cells ( SCLs ) were derived from endarterectomized tissue of a single chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) patient during incubation of those thrombi at second passage as described at our previous report . These cells had malignant potential , with an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-14 ( P50281 ) , leading to tumor emboli within pulmonary arteries in in vivo studies . The purpose of this study was to perform a more detailed evaluation of the characteristics of SCLs , and to elucidate the role of the increased expression of P50281 expression in the growth and death of these cells . In order to elucidate the characteristics of SCLs and to confirm the protein expression of P50281 , three-dimentional culture , invasion assays , a Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical studies were performed . To examine the role of P50281 in tumorigenesis , the metalloproteinase inhibitor , batimastat , was administered to SCID mice which were subcutaneously injected with SCLs . Those mice were sacrificed on day 14 and the tumor volume was evaluated . A Western blot analysis showed the increased expression of P50281 in comparison to the expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells ( A549 ) . Immunohistochemistry showed that SCLs were positive for vimentin , P50281 , P08253 and P16070 . However , endothelial markers , such as CD31 and P04275 ( P04275 ) , were negative . The in vivo studies demonstrated that batimastat could suppress the growth of the subcutaneous tumors formed by the SCLs . This study suggested that MMPs had critical roles on the pathological activities of SCLs and that batimastat might have anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects on these cells .
