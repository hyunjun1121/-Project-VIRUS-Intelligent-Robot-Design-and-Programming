Nedd9 restrains renal cystogenesis in Pkd1-/- mice . Mutations inactivating the cilia-localized Pkd1 protein result in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) , a serious inherited syndrome affecting âˆ¼ 1 in 500 people , in which accumulation of renal cysts eventually destroys kidney function . Severity of ADPKD varies throughout the population , for reasons thought to involve differences both in intragenic Pkd1 mutations and in modifier alleles . The scaffolding protein Q14511 , commonly dysregulated during cancer progression , interacts with Aurora-A ( O14965 ) kinase to control ciliary resorption , and with Src and other partners to influence proliferative signaling pathways often activated in ADPKD . We here demonstrate Nedd9 expression is deregulated in human ADPKD and a mouse ADPKD model . Although genetic ablation of Nedd9 does not independently influence cystogenesis , constitutive absence of Nedd9 strongly promotes cyst formation in the tamoxifen-inducible Pkd1fl/fl;Cre/Esr1(+) mouse model of ADPKD . This cystogenic effect is associated with striking morphological defects in the cilia of Pkd1(-/-);Nedd9(-/-) mice , associated with specific loss of ciliary localization of adenylase cyclase III in the doubly mutant genotype . Ciliary phenotypes imply a failure of Aurora-A activation : Compatible with this idea , Pkd1(-/-);Nedd9(-/-) mice had ciliary resorption defects , and treatment of Pkd1(-/-) mice with a clinical Aurora-A kinase inhibitor exacerbated cystogenesis . In addition , activation of the ADPKD-associated signaling effectors Src , Erk , and the P42345 effector S6 was enhanced , and Ca(2+) response to external stimuli was reduced , in Pkd1(-/-);Nedd9(-/-) versus Pkd1(-/-) mice . Together , these results indicated an important modifier action of Nedd9 on ADPKD pathogenesis involving failure to activate Aurora-A .
