Diminished phosphodiesterase-8B potentiates biphasic insulin response to glucose . DB02527 activates multiple signal pathways , crucial for the pancreatic beta-cells function and survival and is a major potentiator of insulin release . A family of phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) terminate the DB02527 signals . We examined the expression of PDEs in rat beta-cells and their role in the regulation of insulin response . Using RT-PCR and Western blot analyses , we identified Q14432 , Q13370 , Q07343 , Q08499 , and O95263 in rat islets and in P01308 -1E cells and several possible splice variants of these PDEs . Specific depletion of Q14432 with small interfering ( si ) RNA ( siPDE3A ) led to a small ( 67 % ) increase in the insulin response to glucose in P01308 -1E cells but not rat islets . siPDE3A had no effect on the glucagon-like peptide-1 ( 10 nmol/liter ) potentiated insulin response in rat islets . Depletion in O95263 levels in rat islets using similar technology ( siPDE8B ) increased insulin response to glucose by 70 % , the potentiation being of similar magnitude during the first and second phase insulin release . The siPDE8B-potentiated insulin response was further increased by 23 % when glucagon-like peptide-1 was included during the glucose stimulus . In conclusion , O95263 is expressed in a small number of tissues unrelated to glucose or fat metabolism . We propose that O95263 , an DB07954 -insensitive DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase , could prove a novel target for enhanced insulin response , affecting a specific pool of DB02527 involved in the control of insulin granule trafficking and exocytosis . Finally , we discuss evidence for functional compartmentation of DB02527 in pancreatic beta-cells .
