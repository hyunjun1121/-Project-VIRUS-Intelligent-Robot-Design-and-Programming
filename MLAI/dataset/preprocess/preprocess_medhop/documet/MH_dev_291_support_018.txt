A selenosemicarbazone complex with copper efficiently down-regulates the 90-kDa heat shock protein P07900 and its client proteins in cancer cells . BACKGROUND : The 90-kDa heat shock protein P07900 is critical for the stability of several proteins that are important for tumor progression and thus , is a promising target for cancer therapy . Selenosemicarbazone metal complexes have been shown to possess anticancer activity through an unknown molecular mechanism . METHODS : The MTT assay , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , and fluorescent microscopy were used to analyze the mechanism of the anti-cancer activity of the selenosemicarbazone metal complexes . Additionally , RNA-seq was applied to identify transcriptional gene changes , and in turn , the signaling pathways involved in the process of 2-24a/Cu-induced cell death . Last , the expression of P07900 , P0DMV8 , P11309 , and AKT proteins in 2-24a/Cu-treated cells were investigated by western blot analysis . RESULTS : A novel selenosemicarbazone copper complex ( 2-24a/Cu ) efficiently induced G2/M arrest and was cytotoxic in cancer cells . 2-24a/Cu significantly induced oxidative stress in cancer cells . Interestingly , although RNA-seq revealed that the transcription of P07900 was increased in 2-24a/Cu-treated cells , western blotting showed that the expression of P07900 protein was significantly decreased in these cells . Furthermore , down-regulation of P07900 led to the degradation of its client proteins ( P11309 and P31749 ) , which are also cancer therapy targets . CONCLUSION : Our results showed that 2-24a/Cu efficiently generates oxidative stress and down-regulates P07900 and its client proteins ( P11309 , P31749 ) in U2os and HeLa cells . These results demonstrate the potential application of this novel copper complex in cancer therapy .
