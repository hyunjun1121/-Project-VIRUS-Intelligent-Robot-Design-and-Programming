Pro12Ala sequence variant of the P37231 gene is associated with postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in non-E3/E3 patients with the metabolic syndrome . BACKGROUND : Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia , a component of the metabolic syndrome , has varied etiology and involves many genes related to triglyceride metabolism . Variations in these genes may affect postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in the context of the metabolic syndrome . METHODS : We orally administered 60 g of fat overload to 74 patients with the metabolic syndrome . We then measured baseline concentrations of cholesterol , triglycerides , HDL cholesterol , apolipoprotein AI , apolipoprotein B , uric acid , and uric acid excretion ; we also performed homeostasis model assessments of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity . At 3 h , we measured triglycerides , cholesterol , apolipoprotein AI , and apolipoprotein B . Patients were considered to have postprandial hypertriglyceridemia if the difference in plasma triglycerides between baseline and 3 h after the test was 1.71 mmol/L or more . We also measured anthropometrical variables and classified the patients according to their peroxisome proliferative activated receptor , gamma ( P37231 ) gene and apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) genotype . RESULTS : Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia occurred in 64.7 % of patients with the Ala12 allele vs 19.9 % of the Pro12Pro patients , ( P = 0.00032 ; odds ratio , 7.6 ) , and in 87.5 % of the patients with both the Ala12 allele and the non-E3/E3 P02649 genotype ( odds ratio , 23.8 ) . Logistic regression analysis showed that P37231 and P02649 sequence variants were associated with the presence of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia . CONCLUSION : The Pro12Ala P37231 sequence variant together with a non-E3/E3 P02649 genotype is associated with a high risk for postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome , indicating a close association between these genes and the regulation of lipoproteinase clearance .
