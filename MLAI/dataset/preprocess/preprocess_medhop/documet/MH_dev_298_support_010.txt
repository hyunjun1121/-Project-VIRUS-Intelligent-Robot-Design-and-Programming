5-HT manipulation and dietary choice : variable carbohydrate ( Polycose ) suppression demonstrated only under specific experimental conditions . The effects of six 5-HT anorectic agents , d-fenfluramine ( 5-HT releaser and reuptake inhibitor ) , fluoxetine ( 5-HT reuptake inhibitor ) , mCPP ( P28222 / P28335 receptor agonist ) , RU24969 ( P08908 / P28222 receptor agonist ) , MK212 ( P28335 receptor agonist ) and DOI ( 5-HT2/ P28335 receptor agonist ) , and two non-5-HT anorectic agents , salbutamol ( beta 2-adrenergic agonist ) and DB01576 ( catecholaminergic agonist ) , were examined in an experimental procedure designed to disclose selective effects on carbohydrate consumption . In this procedure , a revised version of what we have termed " The Classic Sclafani Paradigm " , animals are presented with powdered Polycose as an optional carbohydrate supplement to hydrated chow ( nutritionally complete diet ) . All drugs produced significant reductions in total ( hydrated chow plus powdered Polycose ) intake . However , only the 5-HT drugs DOI and fluoxetine exerted significantly stronger anorectic effects on intake of powdered Polycose than on intake of hydrated chow . d- DB00574 also showed a tendency to selectively suppress Polycose intake but this effect marginally failed to reach significance . These results suggest that when experimental conditions are favourable , what appears to be selective carbohydrate ( Polycose ) suppression can be demonstrated with certain 5-HT drugs . They also suggest that a selective effect on carbohydrate intake is not the most prominent feeding response to 5-HT drugs .
