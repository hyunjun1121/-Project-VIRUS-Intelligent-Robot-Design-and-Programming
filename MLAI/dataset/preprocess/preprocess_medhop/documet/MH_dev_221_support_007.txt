Activation of invariant NKT cells by toll-like receptor 9-stimulated dendritic cells requires type I interferon and charged glycosphingolipids . Invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells are a subset of innate lymphocytes that recognize lipid antigens in the context of CD1d and mediate potent immune regulatory functions via the rapid production of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) . We investigated whether diverse Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signals in myeloid dendritic cells ( DCs ) could differentially stimulate iNKT cells . Together with the lipopolysaccharide-detecting receptor O00206 , activation of the nucleic acid sensors Q9NYK1 and Q9NR96 in DCs were particularly potent in stimulating iNKT cells to produce P01579 , but not P05112 . iNKT cell activation in response to Q9NR96 stimulation required combined synthesis of type I interferon and de novo production of charged beta-linked glycosphingolipid(s) by DCs . In addition , DCs stimulated via Q9NR96 activated both iNKT cells and NK cells in vivo and protected mice against B16F10-induced melanoma metastases . These data underline the role of Q9NR96 in iNKT cell activation and might have relevance to infectious diseases and cancer .
