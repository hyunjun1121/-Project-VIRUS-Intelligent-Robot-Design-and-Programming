Down-regulation of human osteoblast PTH/ P12272 receptor mRNA in end-stage renal failure . BACKGROUND : Resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) has been demonstrated in end-stage renal failure and is considered to be important in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism . The mechanism of resistance is unknown . However , altered regulation of cellular PTH/PTH-related protein ( PTH/ P12272 ) receptor ( Q03431 ) has been assumed to be important . METHODS : We have used in situ hybridization to examine Q03431 mRNA expression by osteoblasts in human bone and have compared the expression in high- and low-turnover renal bone disease , high-turnover nonrenal bone disease ( healing fracture callus and Pagetic bone ) , and normal bone . Bone biopsies were formalin fixed , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid decalcified , and paraffin wax embedded . A 1.8 kb Q03431 cDNA probe , labeled with 35S , was used , and the hybridization signal was revealed by autoradiography . The density of signal over osteoblasts was quantitated using a semiautomated Leica image analysis software package . RESULTS : The mean density of Q03431 mRNA signal over osteoblasts in renal high-turnover bone was only 36 % of that found in nonrenal high-turnover bone ( P < 0.05 ) and 51 % of that found in normal bone ( P < 0.05 ) . Osteoblast Q03431 mRNA signal in adynamic bone from individuals with diabetes mellitus was 28 % of normal bone ( P < 0.05 ) and 54 % of that found in renal high-turnover bone ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate a down-regulation of osteoblast Q03431 mRNA in end-stage renal failure in comparison to normal and high-turnover bone from otherwise healthy individuals , and provide an insight into the mechanisms of " skeletal resistance " to the actions of PTH .
