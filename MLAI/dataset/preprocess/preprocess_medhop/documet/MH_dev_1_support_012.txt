Identification of an antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies . Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( P49591 ) is a life-threatening disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus ( CoV ) , P49591 -CoV . The spike ( S ) glycoprotein of CoV is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus neutralization by antibodies . Hence , knowledge of neutralization determinants on the Q15517 is helpful for designing protective vaccines . To analyze the antigenic structure of the P49591 -CoV S2 domain , the carboxyl-terminal half of the Q15517 , we first used sera from convalescent P49591 patients to test the antigenicity of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire S2 and identified two antigenic determinants ( DB00149 803 to Ala 828 and Pro 1061 to DB00133 1093 ) . To determine whether neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by these two determinants , we immunized animals and found that both of them could induce the S2-specific antisera . In some animals , however , only one determinant ( DB00149 803 to Ala 828 ) was able to induce the antisera with the binding ability to the native Q15517 and the neutralizing activity to the P49591 -CoV pseudovirus . This determinant is highly conserved across different P49591 -CoV isolates . Identification of a conserved antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the P49591 -CoV Q15517 , which has the potential for inducing neutralizing antibodies , has implications in the development of effective vaccines against P49591 -CoV .
