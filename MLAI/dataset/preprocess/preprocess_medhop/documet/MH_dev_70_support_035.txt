Prevalence of the dihydrofolate reductase DB00174 -108 mutation as the basis for pyrimethamine-resistant falciparum malaria in the Brazilian Amazon . DB00205 resistance in cultivated laboratory isolates of Plasmodium falciparum is linked to the dihydrofolate reductase mutation DB00174 -108 , a mutation that acts by interrupting drug binding within the active site of the enzyme . To determine the prevalence of this mutation in endemic regions harboring pyrimethamine-resistant malaria , we used a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay to survey P. falciparum strains from a wide section of the Brazilian Amazon . Mutations were identified directly from blood samples without intervening steps of in vitro cultivation . Of 42 samples collected from four states in Brazil , 38 ( 90 % ) contained the DB00174 -108 codon AAC that confers pyrimethamine resistance , four samples contained only the wild-type DB00133 -108 codon AGC , and none contained the DB00156 -108 codon ACC found in cycloguanil-resistant pyrimethamine-sensitive strains . These findings indicate that a very high incidence of the DB00174 -108 P00374 mutation is responsible for pyrimethamine resistance in the Amazon , and they are consistent with recent failure rates reported for Fansidar ( pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine ) . We suggest that limited use of proguanil be evaluated as an alternative to pyrimethamine .
