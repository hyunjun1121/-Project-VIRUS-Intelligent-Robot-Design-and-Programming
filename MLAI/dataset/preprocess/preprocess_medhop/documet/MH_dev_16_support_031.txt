Characterization of a novel Q13639 receptor antagonist of the azabicycloalkyl benzimidazolone class : DAU 6285 . Three chemical classes of serotonin Q13639 receptor agonists have been identified so far : 5-substituted indoles ( e.g. 5-HT ) , benzamides ( e.g. renzapride ) and benzimidazolones ( e.g. BIMU 8 ) . In a search for Q13639 receptor antagonists , we have discovered that the benzimidazolone derivative DAU 6285 ( for structure see text ) , is 3-5 times more potent than tropisetron in blocking 5-HT , renzapride and BIMU 8 induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in mouse embryo colliculi neurons . Schild plot analysis yielded Ki values of 220 , 181 and 255 nmol/l , respectively . In addition , DAU 6285 showed poor activity as a 5- Q9H205 receptor ligand with respect to tropisetron , as demonstrated by in vitro binding studies ( Ki , 322 vs 2.8 nmol/l ) and by its antagonistic activity in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex test ( ID50 , 231 vs 0.5 micrograms/kg , i.v. ) . No significant binding ( Ki greater than 10 mumol/l ) of DAU 6285 to serotonergic P08908 , P28222 , P28335 , P28221 , and 5-HT2 receptors as well as to adrenergic alpha 1 , alpha 2 , dopaminergic D1 , D2 or muscarinic M1-M3 receptor subtypes was found . The data indicate that DAU 6285 has a somewhat higher affinity than tropisetron for Q13639 receptors , a property confirmed in functional tests , and much lower affinity than tropisetron for 5- Q9H205 receptors . The compound represents a new interesting tool for investigating the pharmacological and physiological properties of Q13639 receptors .
