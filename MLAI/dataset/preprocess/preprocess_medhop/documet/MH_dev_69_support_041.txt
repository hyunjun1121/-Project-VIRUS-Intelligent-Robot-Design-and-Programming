Molecular genetics of bipolar disorder . Bipolar disorder ( BPD ) is an often devastating illness characterized by extreme mood dysregulation . Although family , twin and adoption studies consistently indicate a strong genetic component , specific genes that contribute to the illness remain unclear . This study gives an overview of linkage studies of BPD , concluding that the regions with the best evidence for linkage include areas on chromosomes 2p , 4p , 4q , 6q , 8q , 11p , 12q , 13q , 16p , 16q , 18p , 18q , 21q , 22q and Xq . Association studies are summarized , which support a possible role for numerous candidate genes in BPD including P21964 , Q01959 , Q13639 , P21917 , P14416 , P28223 , 5-HTT , the P59103 /G30 complex , Q9NRI5 , Q99572 , P21397 and P23560 . Animal models related to bipolar illness are also reviewed , with special attention paid to those with clear genetic implications . We conclude with suggestions for strategies that may help clarify the genetic bases of this complex illness .
