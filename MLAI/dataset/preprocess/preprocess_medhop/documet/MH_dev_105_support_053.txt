Generation of Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes resistant to the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus ( FK506 ) . Adoptive transfer of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( EBV-CTLs ) to solid organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients has been shown safe and effective for the treatment of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . SOT recipients , however , require the continuous administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft rejection , and these agents may significantly limit the long-term persistence of transferred EBV-CTLs , precluding their use as prophylaxis . DB00864 ( FK506 ) is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive agents in SOT recipients , and its immunosuppressive effects are largely dependent on its interaction with the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein ( P62942 ) . We have knocked down the expression of P62942 in EBV-CTLs using a specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) stably expressed from a retroviral vector and found that P62942 -silenced EBV-CTLs are FK506 resistant . These cells continue to expand in the presence of the drug without measurable impairment of their antigen specificity or cytotoxic activity . We confirmed their FK506 resistance and anti-PTLD activity in vivo using a xenogenic mouse model , suggesting that the proposed strategy may be of value to enhance EBV-specific immune surveillance in patients at high risk of PTLD after transplantation .
