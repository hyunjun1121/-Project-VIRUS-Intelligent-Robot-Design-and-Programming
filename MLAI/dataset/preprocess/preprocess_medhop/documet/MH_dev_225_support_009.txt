The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II . P35354 ( P35354 ) is up-regulated in stromal and inflammatory cells . The inducible P35354 isoform is expressed during inflammation , in some cancers , and in brain tissue after global and focal ischemia . Tissue acidosis is a dominant factor in inflammation , and contributes to pain and hyperalgesia . Recently , compelling epidemiological and clinical evidence has documented the P36551 -independent effects of some P35354 inhibitors ( i.e. , celecoxib , valdecoxib , and rofecoxib ) ; among these effects are carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) inhibition . Carbonic anhydrases are zinc metalloenzymes expressed in various cell types , including those of the kidney , where they act as general acid-base catalysts . The kidneys are also known to express the highest concentration of P35354 messenger ribonucleic acid . Celecoxib , like the prototypic CA inhibitor acetazolamide , is structurally characterized by an unsubstituted sulfonamide moiety . In the present study , we report that celecoxib exhibits the characteristics of a potent CA inhibitor , showing inhibitory human carbonic anhydrase II ( hCAII ) activity in the nanomolar range . DB00580 was relatively less potent . DB00533 , which lacks the unsubstituted sulfonamide moiety characteristic of CA inhibitors , showed no significant hCAII inhibitory activity . The current study corroborates our earlier report of structure-activity relationships as predictors of such metabolic events as hyperchloremia , acidosis , and changes in calcium and phosphate disposition ; and clinical manifestations associated with CA inhibition reported with celecoxib . These data showing inhibition of hCAII by the unsubstituted sulfonamides celecoxib and valdecoxib , but not by rofecoxib , may have important implications for the elucidation of the mechanisms of action as well as the side effects associated with P35354 inhibitors .
