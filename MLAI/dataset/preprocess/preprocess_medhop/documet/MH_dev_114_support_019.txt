Sulfasalazine inhibits lyso- Q15004 : acetyl-COA acetyltransferase . Sulfasalazine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the enzymatic synthesis of platelet-activating factor ( Q15004 ) in lysates of rat pleural neutrophils , with an IC50 of 50 microM . Major metabolites of sulfasalazine , DB00244 and sulfapyridine , inhibited this enzymatic synthesis at much higher concentrations . Inhibition of arachidonate P09917 by sulfasalazine and its major metabolites was also observed at higher concentrations ( 2-3 mM ) . Because Q15004 is a potent mediator of inflammatory responses , an inhibition of Q15004 synthesis by sulfasalazine may contribute to its therapeutic actions in conditions such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatic illnesses .
