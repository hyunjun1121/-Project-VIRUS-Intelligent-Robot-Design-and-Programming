Arundic acid ( DB05343 ) ameliorates delayed ischemic brain damage by preventing astrocytic overproduction of P04271 . After focal cerebral ischemia , the infarct volume increases rapidly within acute infarct expansion ( initial 12 to 24 h ) and continues slowly during delayed infarct expansion ( 25 to 168 h ) . While acute infarct expansion represents progressive necrosis within the ischemic core , delayed infarct expansion starts as disseminated apoptotic cell death in a narrow rim surrounding the infarct border , which gradually coalesces to form a larger infarct . Discovery of a distinct correlation between reactive astrogliosis along the infarct border and delayed infarct expansion in the rodent ischemia model led us to investigate the possible causal relationship between the two events . Specifically , the calcium binding protein P04271 exerts detrimental effects on cell survival through activation of various intracellular signaling pathways , resulting in altered protein expression . Arundic acid [ ( R ) -(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid , DB05343 ] is a novel agent that inhibits P04271 synthesis in cultured astrocytes . In the rodent ischemia model , this agent was shown to inhibit both the astrocytic overexpression of P04271 and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways in the peri-infarct area . Concurrently , delayed infarct expansion was prevented , and neurologic deficits were promptly ameliorated . The results of subsequent studies suggest that the efficacy of arundic acid is mediated by restoring the activity of astroglial glutamate transporters via enhanced genetic expression .
