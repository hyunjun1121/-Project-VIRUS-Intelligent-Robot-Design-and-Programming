P14210 improves viability after H2O2-induced toxicity in bile duct epithelial cells . Intracellular defence mechanisms against oxidative stress may play an important role in the progression of liver diseases , including cholangiopathies . The multifunctional anti-apoptotic hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) has been suggested to have antioxidant functions . The effect of P14210 upon cell viability , the generation of ROS , the expression of genes that play a role in ROS defence , and the activation of caspase-3 were measured in bile duct epithelial ( BDE ) cells in the presence or absence of H(2)O(2) . P14210 reduced H(2)O(2)-induced loss of viability , diminished H(2)O(2)-mediated ROS generation and abrogated H(2)O(2)-triggered changes in DB00143 /GSSG ratio . Furthermore , P14210 increased the gene-expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase ( P48506 ) and glutathione reductase ( P00390 ) , while no effect was seen upon the gene-expression of superoxide dismutase 1 ( P00441 ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( P07203 ) , and glutathione synthetase ( P00390 ) . Finally , P14210 diminished the proteolytical activation of the key mediator of apoptosis ( caspase-3 ) after H(2)O(2) exposure . Together , P14210 may improve viability in bile duct epithelia cells after H(2)O(2) induced toxicity by proliferation , strengthening the intrinsic antioxidant defences , and/or by an attenuation of apoptosis . These in vitro results support the evaluation of P14210 as antioxidative factor in hepatobiliary pathologies .
