Panaxatriol saponin ameliorated liver injury by acetaminophen via restoring thioredoxin-1 and pro-caspase-12 . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Acetaminophen ( DB00316 ) is widely used as an antipyretic agent which is safe at therapeutic doses . However , overdose of DB00316 induces fatal and non-fatal hepatic necroses . The chemical reactive metabolites of DB00316 initiate toxicity and inflammatory response within the liver and lead to acute liver failure . However , the mechanism underlying DB00316 -induced liver injury is unknown . P10599 -1 ( TRX-1 ) is an important redox regulator , which plays roles in resisting oxidative stress , regulating inflammation and inhibiting apoptosis . Panaxatriol saponin ( Q03393 ) is one of the biologically active fractions of Panax notoginseng which is a traditional Chinese medicine . The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism on Q03393 protecting liver from DB00316 hepatotoxicity . METHODS : Mice were divided into three groups , control group , DB00316 group and DB00316 combined with Q03393 group . DB00160 aminotransferase ( ALT ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) were detected by ELISA . TRX-1 and pro-caspase-12 were examined by Western blotting . RESULTS : Our results showed Q03393 inhibited the levels of ALT and P01375 -α by DB00316 . Pretreatment with Q03393 ameliorated liver injury induced by DB00316 . The decrease in TRX-1 expression was restored by Q03393 , as well as decreased pro-caspase-12 expression was inhibited by Q03393 . These data suggest that Q03393 has roles in suppressing the hepatotoxicity by DB00316 . CONCLUSION : Panaxatriol saponin ameliorated liver injury by DB00316 through restoring the expression TRX-1 and inhibiting pro-caspase-12 decrease .
