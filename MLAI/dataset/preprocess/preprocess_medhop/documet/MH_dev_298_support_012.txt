Mediation by 5-hydroxytryptamine2B receptors of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat jugular vein . 1. An ' atypical ' 5-HT2 receptor which is located on the endothelium of rat jugular vein has been described . In the present study we have further defined the nature of the 5-HT2 receptor subtype present in this preparation . 2 . In experiments conducted in the presence of ketanserin to preclude involvement of 5-HT2 receptors , the mixed P41595 /2C antagonist , SB 200646 , acted as an antagonist of 5-HT at the endothelial 5-HT receptor ( pA2 = 7.2 ) . Yohimbine , which exhibits negligible affinity for rat P28335 receptors but has high P41595 receptor affinity , acted as a potent but non-surmountable antagonist ( pA2 > or = 7.3 ) in rat jugular vein . Neither yohimbine nor SB 200646 affected endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by carbachol . 3 . DB06148 also acted as a surmountable antagonist ( pA2 = 7.3 ) and the P41595 agonist , BW 723C86 , acted as a potent partial agonist ( pEC50 [ 95 % C L ] , intrinsic activity +/- s.e. mean = 7.9 [ 7.6-8.3 ] , 0.84 +/- 0.04 ) . Responses to BW 723C86 were antagonized by SB 200646 ( 0.3 microM ) yielding an ' apparent ' pA2 [ 95 % CL ] of 7.03 [ 6.76-7.32 ] . 4 . These data are consistent with the presence of P41595 receptors mediating endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat jugular vein .
