Acetylbritannilactone suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular smooth muscle cell inflammatory response . To investigate the mechanism of action by which a new anti-inflammatory active compound , 1-O-acetylbritannilactone ( P00519 ) isolated from Inula britannica-F. , inhibits inflammatory responses in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the levels of prostandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) production . Immunocytochemistry staining and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) p65 and the expression of IkappaB-alpha , pIkappaB-alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) were used to detect DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in VSMCs . P00519 ( 5 , 10 , 20 micrommol/l ) had several concentration-dependent effects , including inhibition of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced PGE(2) production and P35354 expression , and blockade of NF-kappaB activation and translocation . These effects were owing to reductions in IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation induced by LPS . In addition , P00519 directly inhibited the binding of active NF-kappaB to specific DNA cis-element . These results indicate that P00519 is a potent inhibitor of LPS-stimulated VSMC inflammatory responses through blockade of NF-kappaB activity and inhibition of inflammatory gene P35354 expression .
