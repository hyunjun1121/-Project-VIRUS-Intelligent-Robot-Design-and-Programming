DB08932 : first global approval . DB08932 ( OpsumitÂ® ) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd . In October 2013 , oral macitentan 10 mg once daily received its first global approval in the US , followed closely by Canada , for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The drug has also received a positive opinion in the EU from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of PAH , and is under regulatory review in several other countries for the same indication . Endothelin ( ET ) -1 influences pathological changes via two ET receptor subtypes ( P25101 and ETB ) , to which it binds with high affinity . ET-1 is implicated in several forms of vascular disease making it a valid target for the treatment of pulmonary vascular diseases such as PAH . Clinical development is underway for other indications , including Eisenmenger syndrome , ischaemic digital ulcers secondary to systemic sclerosis , and glioblastoma . DB08932 was also evaluated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ; however , a phase 2 trial did not meet its primary endpoint and further investigation in this indication was discontinued . DB08932 was developed by modifying the structure of DB00559 in the search for an optimal dual ERA with improved efficacy and tolerability compared with other ERAs . This article summarizes the milestones in the development of macitentan leading to this first approval for PAH .
