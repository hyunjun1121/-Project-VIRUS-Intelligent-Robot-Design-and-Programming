DB00013 plasminogen activator is elevated in human astrocytic gliomas relative to normal adjacent brain . We assayed urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , tissue type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) in 43 human brain tumors ( predominantly astrocytic gliomas ) and in histologically disease-free brain tissue resected with 21 of the tumors . Levels of uPA , tPA , and P05121 , measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , varied widely among individuals in neoplastic and in normal tissue but did not correlate with age or sex . Pairwise comparison of neoplastic and normal tissue from 21 individuals revealed that mean tumor uPA level was elevated 6-fold ( P < 0.001 ) . Mean tumor tPA and P05121 were 2.5-fold greater than those of normal brain , but these differences were not statistically significant . Tumor uPA was elevated 2- to 30-fold in 16/21 paired samples ( 76 % ) . In contrast , tumor tPA was elevated 2- to 22-fold in 7/21 ( 33 % ) of pairs , whereas tumor P05121 was 2- to 13-fold greater in 10/21 ( 48 % ) of pairs . Our results demonstrate that elevation of uPA content is frequent in astroglial tumors , as is the case in other major human cancers .
