Cytokeratin expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors : morphology , meaning , and mimicry . BACKGROUND : Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) are biologically distinctive neoplasms harboring P10721 and P16234 mutations . Cytokeratin expression in GISTs is an under-recognized diagnostic pitfall , especially in high grade GISTs with limited biopsy material and from metastatic sites . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We evaluated the histomorphology and expression of four ' broad-spectrum ' cytokeratin markers , P02730 - P48751 , P62158 5.2 , P85037 -116 , and 34Î² Q96BH3 in 64 GISTs diagnosed over a 68-month period . Individual cytokeratins 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 were investigated in the ' broad-spectrum ' cytokeratin-positive GISTs . RESULTS : Of 64 GISTs , 10 ( 15 % ) demonstrated cytokeratin immunopositivity . All 10 , considered high risk by the National Institutes of Health consensus approach , were immunopositive for P62158 5.2 and P85037 -116 . Seven were P02730 - P48751 immunopositive . Cytokeratins 8 and 18 were confirmed in 10 and 9 GISTs , respectively . One GIST demonstrated biphasic morphology with cytokeratin immunonegativity in low-grade spindle and immunopositivity in high-grade epithelioid foci . P10721 and P16234 mutational analysis , undertaken in 5/10 cytokeratin-positive GISTs , harbored P10721 exon 11 mutations . CONCLUSION : We hypothesize that cytokeratin expression exclusively in high risk GISTs is a consequence of tumor progression . Given the increasing number of commercially available broad-spectrum cytokeratin immunomarkers , including those reacting with cytokeratins 8 and 18 , cytokeratin-positive GISTs must be differentiated from carcinomas , melanomas , and a range of cytokeratin-positive sarcomas to ensure optimal patient management and prognostication .
