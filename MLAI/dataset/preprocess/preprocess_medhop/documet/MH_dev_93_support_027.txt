Pharmacokinetic evaluation of frovatriptan . INTRODUCTION : Migraine is the most common painful neurological disorder , affecting 13 % of the general population . Triptans represent a powerful pharmacological tool in acute migraine treatment , however , a significant portion of treated patients can not have access to this class due to possible adverse affects . Today , a total of seven DB00669 molecules are available , representing a commonly prescribed migraine treatment . Although there is a need of extensive use of triptans , only 25 % of migraine patients are using triptans . AREAS COVERED : This review includes triptans and evidence for the use of frovatriptan . A systematic approach is used to discuss the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of frovatriptan , considering the emerging data on the clinical efficacy of frovatriptan in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches . The data were obtained by searching the following key words in MEDLINE : pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , triptans , frovatriptan , migraine , menstrual migraine , relatively to the period 1988 - 2011 . EXPERT OPINION : DB00998 has been developed in order to improve safety and efficacy of triptans . It shows a favorable tolerability and efficacy profile , limited to 24/48-h headache recurrence , when compared with other triptans . Preclinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile of frovatriptan may differ from other available triptans . In fact , among triptans , frovatriptan showed the highest potency at the P28222 receptor ( 8.2 ) and the longer half-life ( 26 h ) . These parameters determine the clinical properties of frovatriptan ; in particular the lowest rate of headache recurrence in comparison with other triptans .
