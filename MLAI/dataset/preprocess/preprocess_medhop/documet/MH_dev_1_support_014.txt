Order of genes on human chromosome 5q with respect to 5q interstitial deletions . Using ( a ) somatic cell hybrids retaining partial chromosome 5 and ( b ) clinical samples from patients with acquired deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 , combined with chromosome 5-linked DNA probes , some of which exhibited RFLPs , we have determined the order of a series of genes on chromosome 5 . The order established is 5pter ---- MLVI-2 ---- cen ---- P07686 ---- P00374 ---- Pi227- --- cp12.6 ---- ( P05113 , P05112 ) ---- P08700 ---- P04141 ---- P05230 ---- ( P07333 , P09619 ) ---- ( treC,ADRBR ) ---- ( Q5SW96 - Q13585 , P09603 ) ---- qter . The suggested order and orientation for the closely linked P08700 / P04141 gene pair is cen ---- 5' P08700 3' ---- 5' P04141 3' ---- qter , on the basis of analysis of the P04141 rearrangement in HL60 DNA . The map position of the GRL locus , which was consistent with both somatic cell hybrid and 5q- analyses , was telomeric to P04141 and centromeric to P07333 / P09619 , near P05230 . Long-range restriction-enzyme analysis of 5q- DNAs did not detect rearrangements of 5q-linked probes except in HL60 DNA , but it did reveal putative long-range RFLPs of several loci . RFLPs for GRL , Pi227 , cp12.6 , P08700 , and P07333 can detect deletions in bone marrow and in leukemia cells from patients with acquired 5q deletions .
