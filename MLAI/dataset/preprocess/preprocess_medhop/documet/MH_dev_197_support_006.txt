Non-phosphorylated FTY720 induces apoptosis of human microglia by activating Q12772 . A synthetic analog of sphingosine named FTY720 ( DB08868 ) , phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase-2 , interacts with sphingosine-1-phosphate ( Q14703 ) receptors expressed on various cells . FTY720 suppresses the disease activity of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chiefly by inhibiting Q14703 -dependent egress of autoreactive T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs , and possibly by exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects directly on brain cells . However , at present , biological effects of FTY720 on human microglia are largely unknown . We studied FTY720-mediated apoptosis of a human microglia cell line HMO6 . The exposure of HMO6 cells to non-phosphorylated FTY720 ( FTY720-non-P ) induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 10.6 ± 2.0 μM , accompanied by the cleavage of caspase-7 and caspase-3 but not of caspase-9 . The apoptosis was inhibited by Z-DQMD-FMK , a caspase-3 inhibitor , but not by Pertussis toxin , a Gi protein inhibitor , suramin , a Q99500 / Q9H228 inhibitor , or W123 , a P21453 competitive antagonist , although HMO6 expressed P21453 , O95136 , and Q99500 . Furthermore , both phosphorylated FTY720 ( FTY720-P ) and SEW2871 , P21453 selective agonists , did not induce apoptosis of HMO6 . Genome-wide gene expression profiling and molecular network analysis indicated activation of transcriptional regulation by sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) in FTY720-non-P-treated HMO6 cells . Western blot verified activation of Q12772 in these cells , and apoptosis was enhanced by pretreatment with simvastatin , an activator of Q12772 , and by overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Q12772 . These observations suggest that FTY720-non-P-induced apoptosis of HMO6 human microglia is independent of Q14703 receptor binding , and positively regulated by the Q12772 -dependent proapoptotic signaling pathway .
