DEF6 , a novel substrate for the Tec kinase Q08881 , contains a glutamine-rich aggregation-prone region and forms cytoplasmic granules that co-localize with P-bodies . Localization of DEF6 ( SLAT/ Q9H4E7 ) , a Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor , to the center of the immune synapse is dependent upon Q08881 , a Tec-family kinase that regulates the spatiotemporal organization of components of T cell signaling pathways and Cdc42-dependent actin polymerization . Here we demonstrate that Q08881 both interacts with DEF6 and phosphorylates DEF6 at tyrosine residues DB00135 (210) and DB00135 (222) . Expression of a GFP-tagged Y210E-Y222E phosphomimic resulted in the formation of DEF6 cytoplasmic granules that co-localized with decapping enzyme 1 ( P12821 ) , a marker of P-bodies ; sites of mRNA degradation . Similarly treatment of cells with puromycin or sodium arsenite , reagents that arrest translation , also resulted in the accumulation of DEF6 in cytoplasmic granules . Bioinformatics analysis identified a glutamine-rich , heptad-repeat region ; a feature of aggregating proteins , within the C-terminal region of DEF6 with the potential to promote granule formation through a phosphorylation-dependent unmasking of this region . These data suggest that in addition to its role as a Q9NR83 , DEF6 may also function in regulating mRNA translation .
