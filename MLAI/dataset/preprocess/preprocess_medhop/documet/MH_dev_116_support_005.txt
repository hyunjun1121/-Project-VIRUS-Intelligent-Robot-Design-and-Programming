Flow cytometric analysis of mammalian glial cultures treated with methotrexate . DB00563 ( MTX ) is an antineoplastic drug that acts by competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . MTX treatment of cultured cell lines leads to the emergence of resistant cell populations . Studies using stepwise selection procedures have demonstrated that MTX resistance conferred by overproduction of P00374 can be caused by P00374 gene amplification . We examined the effect of MTX on cells whose origin more closely approximates the in vivo condition by developing a culture system using dissociated brain tissue from 17-19 day old mouse embryos . At the first passage , cultures were divided into control and MTX groups . Cells were treated with the same or successively higher concentrations of MTX at each passage over a 3-4 month period . The first passage eliminated neurons and left a glial culture comprised of approximately 90 % astrocytes . We used the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter in conjunction with fluorescent dyes to measure P00374 content , DNA content , size , and viability of glial cells following MTX treatment . MTX-treated cells divided but grew more slowly and were larger than untreated cells . Stepwise selection in 30/60/90 nM or 60/120 nM MTX resulted in significant two- to threefold increases in fluorescence , and hence P00374 levels . Slot hybridizations assays demonstrated a threefold increase in P00374 gene copy number in the DNA from the 30/60/90 cultures . Thus , our findings were consistent with the results obtained from somatic cell lines , and lend support to the hypothesis that gene amplification may be a common mechanism for the acquisition of resistance in many types of cells . They also indicate that glial cells may be a specific target for cytotoxic effects of MTX on the central nervous system .
