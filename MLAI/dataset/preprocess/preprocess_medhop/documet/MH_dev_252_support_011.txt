Genetic polymorphisms of P23945 , P05093 , P04798 , Q9HC96 , P06213 , P05121 genes in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome . BACKGROUND : Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , whose genetic basis is not completely well understood , is the most common endocrine disorder in women and it typically develops during adolescence . The aim of this study is to investigate the possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of P23945 , P05093 , P04798 , Q9HC96 , P06213 , P05121 genes and PCOS in adolescent girls . METHODS : DNA samples from forty-four adolescent girls with PCOS and 50 healthy controls were analyzed by PCR-RFLP and direct DNA sequencing to determine the genotypic frequency of 17 different polymorphic loci on the P23945 ( A307T , N680S ) , P05093 ( -34 T/C ) , P04798 ( T6235C ) , Q9HC96 ( 44 , 43 , 19 , 63 ) , P06213 ( exon 17 C/T ) , P05121 ( 4G/5G ) genes . Genotyping of exon 12 ( six polymorphisms ) and intron 12 ( one polymorphism ) of P06213 gene by direct DNA sequencing was performed for the first time in this study . RESULTS : No significant differences were observed in the genotype and allele distributions of above mentioned polymorphisms between cases and control groups . CONCLUSION : Our data does not support an association between SNPs of P23945 , P05093 , P04798 , Q9HC96 , P06213 , P05121 genes and susceptibility to PCOS or related traits in Turkish adolescent girls .
