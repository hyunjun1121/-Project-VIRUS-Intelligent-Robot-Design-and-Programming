Endothelin receptor antagonist exacerbates autoimmune myocarditis in mice . AIMS : Myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy are major causes of heart failure in young adults . Experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) is a mouse model of post-infectious myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy . The pathological role of endothelin ( ET ) in myocarditis has not been elucidated . MAIN METHODS : EAM was induced by immunization of cardiac myosin peptide with complete Freund 's adjuvant on days 0 and 7 in BALB/c mice . An P25101 /ETB dual receptor antagonist , SB209670 , was administered by a continuous infusion from a subcutaneous pump for 2 weeks . KEY FINDINGS : An increase in the heart-to-body weight ratio was observed in SB209670-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice . Heart pathology in SB209670-treated mice was remarkable for gross inflammatory infiltration , in contrast to the lesser inflammation in the hearts of vehicle-treated mice . We found that an ET blockade decreased the number of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the heart . The ET blockade also inhibited the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 that plays a key role in the negative regulation of both Toll-like receptor- and cytokine receptor-mediated signaling . EAM is a P01730 (+) T cell-mediated disease . P01730 (+) T cells isolated from SB209670-treated EAM mice produced less P22301 and more inflammatory cytokines , P05231 and Q16552 , than those isolated from vehicle-treated mice . SIGNIFICANCE : The ET receptor antagonist exacerbated autoimmune myocarditis in mice . Our novel findings suggest that ET may play an important role in the regulation of inflammation in myocarditis .
