Diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197 possesses weak P13639 -ADP-ribosyl activity that potentiates its anti-tumorigenic activity . CRM197 , a mutated diphtheria toxin ( DT ) , has long been recognized to be a non-toxic protein . Based on its non-toxic feature , this protein has been utilized for various purposes , including as an inhibitor of heparin-binding P01133 -like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) and as an immunological adjuvant for vaccination . Here we show evidence that CRM197 has a weak toxicity . This toxicity was observed in cells over-expressing the DT receptor/proHB- P01133 , but not in parental cells , indicating that the toxicity was mediated through DT receptor . CRM197 did not show any toxicity toward DT-resistant cells , which have a mutation in elongation factor 2 , and a cell-free assay revealed the existence of weak P13639 -ADP ribosylation activity in fragment A of CRM197 . Thus , the present study indicates a requirement for specific care in the use of CRM197 at a high dosage , although the toxicity of CRM197 is about 10(6) times less than that of wild-type DT . We found that a monoclonal antibody to DT inhibited CRM197 toxicity , but did not affect the inhibitory activity of CRM197 toward HB- P01133 -induced mitogenic activity . CRM197 strongly inhibits tumour growth in nude mice . The anti-DT monoclonal antibody administered with CRM197 reduced the anti- tumourigenic effect of CRM197 , indicating that the toxicity of CRM197 potentiates its anti- tumourigenic effect .
