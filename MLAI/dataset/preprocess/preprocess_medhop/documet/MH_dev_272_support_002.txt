PEGylation of growth hormone-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) analogues . Synthetically produced GRF1-29 ( DB00010 ) has an amino acid composition identical to the N-terminal 29 amino acids sequence of the natural hypothalamic GHRH1-44 ( Figure 1 ) . It maintains bioactivity in vitro and is almost equally effective in eliciting secretion of endogenous growth hormone in vivo . The main drawbacks associated with the pharmaceutical use of hGRF1-29 relate to its short half-life in plasma , about 10-20 min in humans , which is caused mostly by renal ultrafiltration and enzymatic degradation at the N terminus . PEGylation has been considered as one valid approach to obtain more stable forms of the peptide , with a longer in vivo half-life and ultimately with increased pharmacodynamic response along the somatotropic axis ( endogenous GH , DB01277 levels ) . Different PEGylated P01286 conjugates were obtained and their bioactivity was tested in vitro and in vivo by monitoring endogenous growth hormone ( GH ) serum levels after intravenous ( i.v. ) injection in rats , and intravenous and subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection in pigs . It was found that P01286 -PEG conjugates are able to bind and activate the human Q02643 , although with different potency . The effect of PEG molecular weight , number of PEG chains bound and position of PEGylation site on P01286 activity were investigated . Mono-PEGylated isomers with a PEG5000 polymer chain linked to Lys 12 or Lys 21 residues , showed high biological activity in vitro , which is similar to that of hGRF1-29 , and a higher pharmacodynamic response as compared to unmodified P01286 molecule .
