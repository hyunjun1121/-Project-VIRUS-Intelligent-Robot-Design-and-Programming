P00533 -AKT-Smad signaling promotes formation of glioma stem-like cells and tumor angiogenesis by Q02535 -driven cytokine induction . Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) is causally linked to the pathobiological traits of glioblastoma and genesis of glioma stem-like cells ( P56915 ) , but the underlying mechanism is still unknown . Here , we show that epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) signaling regulates the proliferation , angiogenesis , and acquisition of P56915 characteristics by inducing inhibitor of differentiation 3 ( Q02535 ) and Q02535 -regulated cytokines [ P09341 and interleukins ( IL ) -6 and 8 ] induction . We found that P00533 -mediated Q02535 expression was regulated by Q99717 , which was directly phosphorylated by AKT . Furthermore , Q02535 alone imparted P56915 features to primary astrocytes derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mouse , and P00533 - Q02535 - P05231 signaling axis gave rise to tumor cell heterogeneity . Conversely , P00533 inhibitors suppressed P00533 -AKT- Q99717 -driven induction of Q02535 , which led to a decrease in the tumorsphere forming ability of GSCs and U87MG cells that possess an active mutant P00533 , EGFRvIII , without obvious cytotoxic effects . However , these cells seemed to regain colonogenic ability after removal of the P00533 inhibitors . Together , the results delineate a novel integrative molecular mechanism in which the RTK-ID signaling pathway governs genesis and maintenance of GBM histopathologic features , such as GSCs-based tumor initiation , progression , and angiogenesis .
