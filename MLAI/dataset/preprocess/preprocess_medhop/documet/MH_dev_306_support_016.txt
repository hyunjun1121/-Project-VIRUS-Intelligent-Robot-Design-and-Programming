Suppression of rat breast cancer metastasis and reduction of primary tumour growth by the small synthetic urokinase inhibitor DB05476 . The serine protease uPA ( urokinase-type plasminogen activator ) and its receptor Q03405 ( CD87 ) are often elevated in malignant tumours , hence , inhibition of this tumour-associated plasminogen activation system provides an attractive target for therapeutic strategies . DB05476 , a derivative of 3-aminophenylalanine in the L-conformation with inhibitory antiproteolytic properties , was tested for its specificity spectrum using specific chromogenic paranitroanilide peptide substrates . The corresponding D-enantiomer of DB05476 was used as a control . The anti-tumour and anti-metastatic ( number of lung foci and weight of the axillary lymph nodes ) properties were studied by subcutaneous administration of DB05476 to Brown Norwegian ( BN ) rats carrying orthotopically transplanted BN472 rat breast tumours . DB05476 selectively inhibited tumour-related proteases from rats and humans such as uPA , plasmin , or thrombin in the sub or low micromolar range . The activity was stereoselective as the D-enantiomer of DB05476 inhibited uPA and plasmin at approximately 70-fold higher Ki values than the active L-form . Chronical administration of the L-enantiomer of WXUK1 impaired primary tumour growth and metastasis of BN472 rat breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner . The minimum inhibitory dosage with maximal effect was between 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg/day . The inactive D-enatiomer of DB05476 was not active in this respect . Daily treatment with DB05476 for up to 35 days was well tolerated as judged by the unchanged body and organ weight development . In conclusion , our results provide evidence that DB05476 as a single agent inhibits breast tumour growth and metastasis in vivo , and thus is a promising candidate drug to treat human cancer .
