Gene network profiling before and after transplantation in alcoholic cirrhosis liver transplant recipients . The main objective of this study was to define a gene network profile network in liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis before and after liver transplantation . Genes were selected from data obtained in a previous study of liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis . Selected up-regulated genes were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in different groups of liver transplant recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis ( n=5 ) . Selected genes up-regulated before transplantation were : Q07011 ( tumor necrosis factor [ P01375 ] receptor superfamily , member 9 ) ; P14784 ( interleukin-2 receptor beta ) ; Q92843 ( P10415 -like 2 ) ; Q96PH1 ( NADPH ) oxidase , EF-hand calcium binding domain 5 ) ; P50542 ( peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 ) ; P37231 ( peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ) ; Q96Q05 ( O14920 binding protein ) ; Q9NYR9 ( NFKappaBeta inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 ) ; P05112 ( interleukin-4 ) ; IL-4R ( interleukin 4 receptor ) ; P07327 ( alcohol dehydrogenase 1A , class 1 ) ; O75891 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family , member Q9NUQ9 ) ; P05164 ( myeloperoxidase ) ; P01160 ( natriuretic peptide precursor A ) ; Q16548 ( P10415 -related protein A1 ) ; P24522 ( growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha ) ; P55061 ( P55061 ) ; P42336 ( phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha polypeptide ) ; P38484 ( interferon gamma receptor 2 ) ; O60674 ( Janus Kinase 2 ) ; FAS ( Fas , P01375 receptor superfamily , member 6 ) ; Q92844 ( TRAF family member-associated NFKB activator ) ; O95551 ( O95551 ) ; and P08758 ( annexin A5 ) .
