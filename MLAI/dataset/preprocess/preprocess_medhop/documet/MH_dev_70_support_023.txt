DB00205 -sulfadoxine efficacy and selection for mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase in Mali . To assess pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine ( PS ) efficacy in Mali , and the role of mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) and dihydropteroate synthase ( P49366 ) in in vivo PS resistance , 190 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were treated with PS and monitored for 56 days . Mutation-specific polymerase chain reactions and digestion with restriction endonucleases were used to detect P00374 and P49366 mutations on filter paper blood samples from pretreatment and post-treatment infections . Only one case each of RI and RII level resistance and no cases of RIII resistance or therapeutic failure were observed . Post-PS treatment infections had significantly higher rates of P00374 mutations at codons 108 and 59 . No significant selection for P49366 mutations was seen . DB00205 -sulfadoxine is highly efficacious in Mali , and while the low level of resistance precludes assessing the utility of molecular assays for in vivo PS resistance , rapid selection of P00374 mutations supports their role in PS failure .
