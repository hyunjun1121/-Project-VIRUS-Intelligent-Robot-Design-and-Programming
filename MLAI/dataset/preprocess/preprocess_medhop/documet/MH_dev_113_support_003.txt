DB00642 alters folate phenotype and inflammatory profile in EA.hy 926 cells grown under low-folate conditions . Elevated homocysteine is a risk marker for several major human pathologies . Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations of folate/homocysteine metabolism can directly modify production of inflammatory mediators . DB00642 acts by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase ( P04818 ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) . EA.hy 926 cells grown under low ( " Lo " ) and high ( " Hi " ) folate conditions were treated with pemetrexed . The concentrations of several intracellular folate derivatives were measured using LC-MRM/MS . Lo cells had lower total folate concentrations and a different distribution of the intracellular folate derivatives than Hi cells . Treatment with pemetrexed caused a decrease in individual folate analytes . Microarray analysis showed that several genes were significantly up or down-regulated in pemetrexed treated Lo cells . Several of the significantly up-regulated transcripts were inflammatory . Changes in transcript levels of selected targets , including P01024 , P10145 , and P00374 , were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR . P01024 and P10145 transcript levels were increased in pemetrexed-treated Lo cells relative to Lo controls ; P00374 transcript levels were decreased . In Lo cells , P10145 and P01024 protein concentrations were increased following pemetrexed treatment . DB00642 drug treatment was shown in this study to have effects that lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators in Lo cells . No such changes were observed in Hi cells , suggesting that pemetrexed could not modify the inflammatory profile in the context of cellular folate sufficiency .
