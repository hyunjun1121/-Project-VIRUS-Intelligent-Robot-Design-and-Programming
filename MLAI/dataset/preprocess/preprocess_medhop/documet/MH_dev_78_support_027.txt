Effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase activity in whole blood from aspirin-sensitive asthmatics vs healthy donors . 1. Cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) and lipoxygenase ( LO ) share a common substrate , arachidonic acid . DB00945 and related drugs inhibit P36551 activity . In a subset of patients with asthma aspirin induces clinical symptoms associated with increased levels of certain LO products , a phenomenon known as aspirin-sensitive asthma . The pharmacological pathways regulating such responses are not known . 2 . Here P23219 and LO activity were measured respectively by the formation of thromboxane B(2) ( TXB(2) ) or leukotrienes ( LT ) C(4) , D(4) and E(4) in whole blood stimulated with A23187 . P35354 activity was measured by the formation of prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) in blood stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) for 18 h . 3 . No differences in the levels of P23219 , P35354 or LO products or the potency of drugs were found in blood from aspirin sensitive vs aspirin tolerant patients . DB00945 , indomethacin and nimesulide inhibited P23219 activity , without altering LO activity . Indomethacin , nimesulide and the P35354 selective inhibitor DB00677 [ 5,5-dimethyl-3-(2-isopropoxy)-4-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-2(5H)-furanone ] inhibited P35354 activity . NO-aspirin , like aspirin inhibited P23219 activity in blood from both groups . However , NO-aspirin also reduced LO activity in the blood from both patient groups . Sodium salicylate was an ineffective inhibitor of P23219 , P35354 or LO activity in blood from both aspirin-sensitive and tolerant patients . 4 . Thus , when P36551 activity in the blood of aspirin-sensitive asthmatics is blocked there is no associated increase in LO products . Moreover , NO-aspirin , unlike other NSAIDs tested , inhibited LO activity in the blood from both aspirin sensitive and aspirin tolerant individuals . This suggests that NO-aspirin may be better tolerated than aspirin by aspirin-sensitive asthmatics .
