Roles of urokinase type plasminogen activator in a brain stab wound . DB00013 type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) may influence brain pathophysiology after injury . We studied disruption of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) and changes in the vasculature after a brain stab wound in uPA-deficient , uPA receptor-deficient , and PA inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) deficient mice . The extravasation of immunoglobulin was greater in P05121 deficient mice ; less pronounced in uPA-deficient mice ; similar to controls in uPA receptor-deficient mice . Vasculatures in the wound proliferated in P05121 deficient mice . Our study shows that uPA affects BBB disruption . PA enhances angiogenesis after brain injury .
