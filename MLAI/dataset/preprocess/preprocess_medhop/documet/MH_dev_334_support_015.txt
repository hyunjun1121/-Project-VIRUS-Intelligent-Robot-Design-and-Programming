Suppression of human inflammatory cell function by subtype-selective DB05876 inhibitors correlates with inhibition of P27815 and Q07343 . 1. Of the four major phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) subtypes , P27815 , Q07343 and Q08499 are widely expressed in human inflammatory cells , including monocytes and T lymphocytes . We explored the functional role of these subtypes using ten subtype-selective DB05876 inhibitors , each belonging to one of two classes : ( i ) dual P27815 / Q07343 inhibitors or ( ii ) Q08499 inhibitors . 2 . These compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit antigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation and bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) release from peripheral blood monocytes . 3 . All compounds inhibited T-cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner ; with IC50 values distributed over an approximately 50 fold range . These compounds also inhibited TNFalpha release concentration-dependently , with a wider ( approximately 1000 fold ) range of IC50 values . 4 . In both sets of experiments , mean IC50 values were significantly correlated with compound potency against the catalytic activity of recombinant human P27815 or Q07343 when analysed by either linear regression of log IC50 values or by Spearman 's rank-order correlation . The correlation between inhibition of inflammatory cell function and inhibition of recombinant Q08499 catalytic activity was not significant in either analysis . 5 . These results suggest that P27815 and/or Q07343 may play the major role in regulating these two inflammatory cell functions but do not rule out Q08499 as an important mediator of other activities in mononuclear leukocytes and other immune and inflammatory cells . Much more work is needed to establish the functional roles of the DB05876 subtypes across a broader range of cellular functions and cell types .
