[ Cellular adhesion signal transduction network of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced hepatocellular carcinoma cells ] . OBJECTIVE : To systemically explore the cellular adhesion signal transduction network of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) -induced hepatocellular carcinoma cells with bioinformatics tools . METHODS : Published microarray dataset of P01375 -α-induced HepG2 , human transcription factor database HTRI and human protein-protein interaction database HPRD were used to construct and analyze the signal transduction network . RESULTS : In the signal transduction network , MYC and SP1 were the key nodes of signaling transduction . Several genes from the network were closely related with cellular adhesion. P00533 ( P00533 ) is a possible key gene of effectively regulating cellular adhesion during the induction of P01375 -α . CONCLUSION : P00533 is a possible key gene for P01375 -α-induced metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
