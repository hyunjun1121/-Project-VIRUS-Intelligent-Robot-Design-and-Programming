The thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin triggers apoptosis through a Bax/Bak-dependent process that involves peroxiredoxin 3 oxidation . P30044 ( TrxR ) is a key selenoprotein antioxidant enzyme and a potential target for anti-cancer drugs . One potent inhibitor of TrxR is the gold ( I ) compound auranofin , which can trigger mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathways . The exact mechanism of apoptosis induction by auranofin is not yet clear , but there are indications that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a central event . We assessed the redox state of the peroxiredoxins ( Prxs ) in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells treated with auranofin , and found that mitochondrial Prx3 was considerably more sensitive to oxidation than the cytosolic Prx1 and 2 , indicating selective mitochondrial stress . Prx3 oxidation was detected at apoptotic doses of auranofin in several cell types , and occurred before other mitochondrial events including cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarisation . DB00995 was also able to sensitise U937 cells to P01375 -mediated apoptosis . DB00995 -induced apoptosis was effectively blocked by the overexpression of Bcl-2 , and Bax/Bak deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were also resistant to apoptosis , indicating a central role for the pro-apoptotic proteins of this family in auranofin-triggered apoptosis . DB00995 exposure inhibited the proliferation of apoptosis-resistant cells , and at higher doses of auranofin could cause cell death through necrosis . We conclude that auranofin induces apoptosis in cells through a Bax/Bak-dependent mechanism associated with selective disruption of mitochondrial redox homeostasis in conjunction with oxidation of Prx3 .
