Advances in immunosuppression for kidney transplantation : new strategies for preserving kidney function and reducing cardiovascular risk . The development of new immunosuppressants for renal transplantation is aimed not only at improving & nbsp;short-term outcomes , but also at achieving better safety , cardiovascular , and metabolic profiles and at decreasing & nbsp;nephrotoxicity . DB06681 is a fusion protein that inhibits T cell activation by binding to P33681 and P42081 antigens . Clinical trials , particularly the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT studies , have shown that belatacept preserves function and structure in renal grafts . The effects of belatacept provide long-term , sustained results , and the safety and efficacy of this drug have been demonstrated in cases of renal transplantation from expanded criteria donors . Compared to calcineurin inhibitors , belatacept is associated with a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy and a more favourable cardiovascular and metabolic profile .
