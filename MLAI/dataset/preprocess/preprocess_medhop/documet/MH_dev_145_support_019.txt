DB08870 followed by allogeneic transplantation as salvage regimen in patients with relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( RR-HL ) have poor outcomes . DB08870 ( BV ) , an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti- P28908 antibody conjugated to the potent anti-microtubule agent , monomethyl auristatin E , induces high tumour responses with moderate adverse effects . In a retrospective study , we describe objective response rates and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo- P09683 ) in patients with RR-HL treated by BV in a named patient program in two French institutions . Twenty-four adult patients with histologically proven P28908 (+) RR-HL treated with BV were included from July 2009 to November 2012 . Response to BV treatment was evaluated after four cycles . Eleven patients were in complete response ( 45.8 % ) , while five patients were in partial response ( 20.8 % ) , with an overall response rate of 66.6 % . Eight patients failed to respond to BV ( 33.3 % ) . All of the responding patients could receive consolidation treatment after BV : three patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation ( auto- P09683 ) , three patients received a tandem auto- P09683 /allo- P09683 , nine patients received allo- P09683 and one patient was treated with donor lymphocyte infusion . We found no treatment-related mortality at day 100 among the 12 patients who underwent BV following by allogeneic transplantation . With a median follow-up of 20 months ( range 10.5-43.2 ) , none of them relapsed or died . BV followed by allo- P09683 represents an effective salvage regimen in patients with RR-HL .
