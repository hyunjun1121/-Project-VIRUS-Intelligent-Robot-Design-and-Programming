Advances in genomic and proteomic studies of non-small-cell lung cancer : clinical and translational research perspective . Recent years have brought tremendous progress in the development of genomic and proteomic platforms to study cancer biology . Tests based on these platforms are helpful in early diagnosis , prognosis , and prediction of treatment benefit . Molecular studies performed on minimally invasive material ( plasma , sputum ) from individuals participating in longitudinal or case-control studies have approximately 70 % -90 % sensitivity and specificity to detect lung cancer . In operable non-small-cell lung cancer , genomic and proteomic studies yield better prognostic information than pathologic staging . There are several examples of successful identification of predictive assays for benefit from chemotherapy ( P07992 , P23921 , P46527 , and p53 expression ) or targeted therapies ( epidermal growth factor receptor [ P00533 ] gene copy number , P00533 activating mutations , P00533 protein expression , serum proteomic profile ) . These markers should be prospectively tested in clinical studies before they can be routinely used in the clinic .
