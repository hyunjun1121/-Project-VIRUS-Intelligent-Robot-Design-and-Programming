Biologic monotherapy as initial treatment in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis . Although biologic agents are most well established as part of combination regimens in patients with RA , biologic monotherapy is common in clinical practice . To date , few double-blind , randomized clinical trials have compared biologic monotherapy with MTX monotherapy . Five randomized double-blind trials evaluating the P01375 antagonists etanercept ( ERA and TEMPO ) , adalimumab ( PREMIER ) and DB06674 ( GO-BEFORE ) and the P05231 receptor antagonist tocilizumab ( AMBITION ) were identified . We noted considerable variation in patient characteristics ( i.e. disease duration and disease severity ) in the five trials . Studies involving monotherapy with P01375 inhibitors found no clear clinical efficacy advantage over MTX monotherapy . In the two trials that included a P01375 inhibitor/MTX combination arm , combination therapy was superior to monotherapy with either agent alone . In contrast , the AMBITION trial demonstrated that tocilizumab monotherapy was superior to MTX in terms of clinical response , disease activity , remission and functionality . Although results can not be compared across clinical trials , tocilizumab was the only biologic agent to demonstrate superiority to MTX as monotherapy in patients with RA with limited/no exposure to MTX .
