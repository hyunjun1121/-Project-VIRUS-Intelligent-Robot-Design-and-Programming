Andrographolide induces apoptosis of P13671 glioma cells via the P29323 -p53-caspase 7-PARP pathway . BACKGROUND : Glioma is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system . Efforts on the development of new chemotherapy are mandatory . Andrographolide ( AND ) , a diterpenoid lactone isolated from the Andrographis paniculata , has been shown to have antitumor activities in several types of cancer cells . Whether AND can exert its antitumor activity in glioblastoma cells remains unknown . This study examined the anticancer effects of AND , both in vitro and in vivo . METHODS : Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry and nuclear staining . The signaling pathway for AND was determined by western blotting . The effects of AND on tumor growth was evaluated in a mouse model . RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : In vitro , with application of specific inhibitors and siRNA , AND-induced apoptosis was proven through ROS- P29323 - P04637 -caspase 7-PARP signaling pathway . In vivo , AND significantly retarded tumor growth and caused regression of well-formed tumors in vivo . Furthermore , AND did not induce apoptosis or activate P29323 and p53 in primary cultured astrocyte cells , and it may serve as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glioma .
