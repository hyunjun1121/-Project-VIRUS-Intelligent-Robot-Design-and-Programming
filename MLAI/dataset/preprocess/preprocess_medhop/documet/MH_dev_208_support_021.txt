P21554 gene is associated with alcohol dependence . BACKGROUND : DB00898 dependence ( AD ) vulnerability is determined by a complex array of genetic factors . Given the potential role of endocannabinoid system in AD , polymorphisms within cannabinoid receptor 1 gene ( P21554 ) have been potentially associated with susceptibility to this disease . We thus aimed to examine the relationship between 3 allelic variants of P21554 ( rs6454674 , rs1049353 , and rs806368 ) and AD . METHODS : Genotyping of the aforementioned polymorphisms was carried out by PCR in 298 male alcoholics ( 187 of them with AD ) and 155 healthy controls . Single-marker , haplotype , and interaction analysis were performed to analyze the influence of P21554 gene on AD susceptibility . RESULTS : We found an association between P21554 gene and AD after haplotype analysis . Alcoholic patients with TGT haplotype ( corresponding to rs6454674-rs1049353-rs806368 polymorphisms in this order ) were less prone to have AD ( p = 0.017 ) . Besides , alcoholics with a G/T substitution of the first marker ( P19440 haplotype ) or a C/T substitution of the third marker ( P21980 haplotype ) were more likely to develop AD ( p = 0.006 and 0.004 , respectively ) and an interaction was found between the G allele of rs6454674 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) and the C allele of rs806368 SNP ( p = 0.009 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings support previously reported associations of P21554 with dependence to alcohol and other substances and emphasizes the relevance of endocannabinoid system in AD .
