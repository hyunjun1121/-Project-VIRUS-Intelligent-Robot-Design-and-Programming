Targeted agents for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma . Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) is a highly treatment-resistant tumor type ; however , advances in elucidating the molecular pathophysiology underlying RCC has led to the identification of promising targets for therapeutic intervention . In clear-cell RCC , mutations to the von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) gene results in the up regulation of many proteins necessary for tumor growth and survival -- such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , which are involved in tumor-initiated angiogenesis . Q16790 and signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) are involved in tumor cell proliferation and are also up regulated by mutation in the P40337 gene . The intracellular messenger pathways phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) and Raf/MEK/ P29323 act as convergence points for positive growth signaling ; the Raf/MEK/ P29323 pathway is also implicated in apoptosis . Several agents in development target P15692 ( bevacizumab ) , the P15692 receptor ( PTK787 , SU11248 , P15692 -trap , and BAY 43-9006 ) , the PDGF receptor ( SU11248 and BAY 43-9006 ) , or the P01133 receptor ( gefitinib , cetuximab , DB01269 , and erlotinib ) . The intracellular Raf/MEK/ P29323 signaling cascade has been targeted at either the level of Raf ( BAY 43-9006 , ISIS 5132 ) or MEK ( CI-1040 , PD184352 and ARRY-142886 ) , and PI3K signaling is disrupted by CCI-779 . DB05304 targets the Q16790 antigen , and PS-341 disrupts the 26S proteasome mediating the degradation of intracellular proteins . Given that multiple pathways contribute to tumor growth , anti-tumor activity may be increased by agents targeting multiple pathways , or by combining agents to allow horizontal or vertical inhibition of multiple pathways .
