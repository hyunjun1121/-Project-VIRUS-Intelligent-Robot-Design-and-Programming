P01258 gene-related peptide regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to decrease transforming growth factor β1-induced hepatic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells . Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) β1-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 is one of factors associated with the development of hepatic fibrosis . P01258 gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) shows hepatoprotective effect during hepatic injuries , including fibrosis . However , the effects of P80511 on P05121 expression induced by TGFβ1 are unknown . In this study , we investigated the effect of P80511 on TGFβ1-induced P05121 expression and its regulatory mechanisms in HepG2 cells . P80511 inhibited TGFβ1-induced P05121 expression . H89 , a protein kinase A inhibitor , abolished the inhibition of TGFβ1-induced P05121 expression by P80511 . TGFβ1 activated mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , including extracellular signal-regulated kinase , c-jun NH2-terminal kinase , and p38 , and this activation was abolished by P80511 . These results show that the P80511 -induced DB02527 /PKA activation suppresses activation of MAPK induced by TGFβ1 , leading to decreased P05121 expression in HepG2 cells .
