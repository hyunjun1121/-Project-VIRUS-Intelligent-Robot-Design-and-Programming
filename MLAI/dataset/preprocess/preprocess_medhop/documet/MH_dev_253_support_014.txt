Targeting the PI3K/ P42345 axis , alone and in combination with autophagy blockade , for the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors . There is a critical need for efficacious therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of patients afflicted by malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( MPNST ) . Multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for deregulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) / P42345 signaling in MPNST , making this axis an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation . On the basis of previous observations obtained from in vitro experimentation , here we aimed to assess the effects of PI3K/ P42345 blockade on MPNST growth in vivo . The anti-MPNST impact of DB05241 , a dual PI3K/ P42345 inhibitor currently being evaluated in human cancer clinical trials , was tested in two human MPNST xenograft models ( STS26T and MPNST724 ) and an experimental model of pulmonary metastasis ( STS26T ) . DB05241 abrogated human MPNST local and metastatic growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice . Notably , this therapeutic approach failed to induce apoptosis in MPNST cells but rather resulted in marked productive autophagy . Importantly , genetic and pharmacologic autophagy blockade reversed apoptotic resistance and resulted in significant PI3K/ P42345 inhibition-induced MPNST cell death . The addition of the autophagy inhibitor , chloroquine , to the therapeutic regimen of MPNST xenografts after pretreatment with DB05241 resulted in superior antitumor effects as compared with either agent alone . Together , preclinical studies described here expand our previous findings and suggest that PI3K/ P42345 inhibition alone and ( most importantly ) in combination with autophagy blockade may comprise a novel and efficacious therapy for patients harboring MPNST .
