P01308 -like growth factor binding proteins in the bovine anterior pituitary . P01308 -like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) were characterized in bovine anterior pituitary tissue , pituitary conditioned media , and serum collected during the preovulatory and early luteal phases of the estrous cycle . Effects of in vitro treatments of pituitaries with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) , estradiol , and progesterone on IGFBP secretion were also evaluated . Predominant IGFBPs detected in anterior pituitary tissue by immunoprecipitation , ligand blotting , and Northern blotting were P24593 ( 29 kDa ) , P18065 ( 32 kDa ) , and P17936 ( 36 and 39 kDa doublet ) . Conditioned culture media contained P24593 , a slightly larger form of P18065 ( 33 kDa ) , the 36- and 39-kDa forms of P17936 , and a more extensively glycosylated form of P17936 ( 44 kDa ) . In serum , P24593 was not readily detected , and P17936 ( 40- and 44-kDa doublet ) and P18065 ( 34 kDa ) were larger than in pituitary tissue . Levels of P18065 , -3 , and -5 in pituitary tissue decreased during the preovulatory period and were lowest in the early luteal phase . Treatment with P01148 increased P18065 levels in media twofold . Estradiol or progesterone did not alter IGFBP secretion in vitro . Predominant IGFBPs produced and released by anterior pituitary tissue were P18065 , -3 and -5 . The activity of IGFBPs fluctuates in the pituitary in association with changes in stage of estrous cycle , implicating IGFBPs as potential regulators of gonadotrope function .
