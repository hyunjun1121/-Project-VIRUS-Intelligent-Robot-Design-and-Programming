Novel and emerging drugs for acute myeloid leukemia : pharmacology and therapeutic activity . For the last twenty years , significant progress in Molecular and Cellular Biology has resulted in a better characterization and understanding of the biology and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . These achievements have provided new opportunities for the development of innovative , more effective therapies . Novel agents potentially useful in the treatment of patients with AML include new formulations of established drugs , newer nucleoside analogs , molecular target drugs , monoclonal antibodies and other agents . Three newer nucleoside analogs , clofarabine , troxacitabine and sapacitabine have been recently investigated in patients with AML . Two methylation inhibitors , 5-azacyticline and decitabine are pyrimidine nucleoside analogs of cytidine which can be incorporated into RNA and/or DNA . Lower doses of these agents are active in AML and have been extensively investigated , especially in secondary AML and AML in elderly patients . DB04960 and lonafarnib are orally available farnesyltransferase inhibitors with in vitro and in vivo activity against AML . In recent years , P36888 inhibitors , lestaurinib , DB05465 and PKC 412 have been developed and tested in AML . The preclinical observations and clinical studies indicate that P36888 inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of P36888 mutated AML patients , especially when used in combinations with chemotherapy . Several newer MDR inhibitors , including valspodar ( PSC-833 ) and zosuquidar trihydrochloride have been also tested for the treatment of relapsed AML . This article reviews the various classes of AML targets and drugs that are under early phase clinical evaluation , especially those that are likely to enter clinical practice in the near future .
