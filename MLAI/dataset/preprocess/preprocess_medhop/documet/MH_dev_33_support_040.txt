Q07869 - γ Regulates Trophoblast Differentiation in the BeWo Cell Model . Common pregnancy complications , such as severe preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction , disrupt pregnancy progression and impair maternal and fetal wellbeing . Placentas from such pregnancies exhibit lesions principally within the syncytiotrophoblast ( P09683 ) , a layer in direct contact with maternal blood . In humans and mice , glial cell missing-1 ( GCM-1 ) promotes differentiation of underlying cytotrophoblast cells into the outer P09683 layer . GCM-1 may be regulated by the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( Q07869 - γ ) ; in mice , Q07869 - γ promotes labyrinthine trophoblast differentiation via Gcm-1 , and , as we previously demonstrated , Q07869 - γ activation ameliorates disease features in rat model of preeclampsia . Here , we aimed to characterize the baseline activity of Q07869 - γ in the human choriocarcinoma BeWo cell line that mimics P09683 formation in vitro and modulate Q07869 - γ activity to study its effects on cell proliferation versus differentiation . We report a novel negative autoregulatory mechanism between Q07869 - γ activity and expression and show that blocking Q07869 - γ activity induces cell proliferation at the expense of differentiation , while these remain unaltered following treatment with the agonist rosiglitazone . Gaining a deeper understanding of the role and activity of Q07869 - γ in placental physiology will offer new avenues for the development of secondary prevention and/or treatment options for placentally-mediated pregnancy complications .
