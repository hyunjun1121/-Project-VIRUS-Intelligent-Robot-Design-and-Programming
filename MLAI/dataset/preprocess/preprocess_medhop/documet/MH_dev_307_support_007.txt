Phase I study of matuzumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin and cisplatin ( PLF ) in patients with advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas . BACKGROUND : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two different weekly doses of the fully humanized epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) -targeting monoclonal antibody matuzumab combined with high-dose 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin and cisplatin ( PLF ) in the first-line treatment of patients with P00533 -positive advanced gastric and esophagogastric adenocarcinomas . METHODS : Patients were treated in two matuzumab dose groups with the first cohort of patients receiving 400 mg matuzumab in combination with PLF . Based on the safety observations the next cohort of patients received 800 mg matuzumab . The study was conducted in two parts , with phase A , designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination , and phase B designed to be a treatment continuation for those patients benefiting from treatment . Treatment cycles were 7 weeks each . Each patient received the dose of matuzumab they were assigned to at study entry for the duration of the study . RESULTS : Fifteen P00533 -positive patients were enrolled into the two matuzumab dose groups ; 400 mg dose n=7 ; 800 mg dose n=8 . All patients experienced at least one adverse event ( AE ) . No patient experienced any serious AE which was considered to be related to matuzumab . Two grade 3 AEs possibly related to matuzumab occurred in 2 different patients ( 13.3 % ) , both in the 800 mg dose group . No dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was observed in the 400 mg group . The maximum tolerated dose of matuzumab was not reached . The best confirmed overall response rate was 26.7 % . CONCLUSION : DB05101 , in combination with PLF , demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with modest anti-tumor activity .
