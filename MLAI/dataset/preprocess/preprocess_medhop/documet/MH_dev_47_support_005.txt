Effects of inhaled prostacyclin analogue on chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension . Inhaled DB01240 has been reported to elicit pulmonary vasodilation , but whether it is also effective in treating chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is still uncertain . We designed this study to address the in vivo effectiveness of inhaled DB05229 , a stable DB01240 analogue , on pulmonary vascular tone during hypoxic exposure in normoxic ( N ) and chronically hypoxic ( CH ) rats . Pulmonary vasodilation was observed by low-dose inhaled DB05229 in N rats , but not in CH rats . It was not until higher doses of DB05229 were given that pulmonary vasodilation was obtained in CH rats . When the agent was continuously administered by an intravascular route at the inhaled dose , it elicited no vasodilation in N rats . On the contrary , it elicited profound vasodilation in CH rats , although a concomitant systemic hypotension was observed . The P43119 mRNA expression was unchanged in the lungs of CH rats compared with that of N rats . We conclude that low doses of aerosolized DB05229 may reduce pulmonary vascular tone in rats without preexisting lung diseases . In contrast , when hypoxic pulmonary hypertension is present , the threshold of DB05229 inhalation was elevated to provoke pulmonary vasodilation .
