15-Deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) inhibits IL-1beta-induced IKK enzymatic activity and P25963 degradation in rat chondrocytes through a PPARgamma-independent pathway . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) ligands have been shown to inhibit the effects of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) . This cytokine plays a key role in articular pathophysiologies by inducing the production of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide ( NO ) and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) . We previously demonstrated that 15d-PGJ(2) was more potent than troglitazone to counteract IL-1beta effects on chondrocytes . Here , we studied the action of 15d-PGJ(2) on intracellular targets in nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) signalling pathway in IL-1beta treated rat chondrocytes . We found that 15d-PGJ(2) decreased inhibitor kappaBalpha ( P25963 ) degradation but not its phosphorylation by specifically inhibiting O15111 beta ( IKKbeta ) , but not IKKalpha , enzymatic activity . We further evaluated the involvement of PPARgamma in the anti-inflammatory action of its ligands . In chondrocytes overexpressing functional PPARgamma protein , 15d-PGJ(2) pre-treatment inhibited inducible NO synthase and P35354 mRNA expression , nitrite and PGE(2) production , p65 translocation and NF-kappaB activation . DB00197 or rosiglitazone pre-treatment had no effect . 15d-PGJ(2) exhibited the same effect in chondrocytes overexpressing mutated PPARgamma protein . These results suggest that 15d-PGJ(2) exerts its anti-inflammatory effect in rat chondrocytes by a PPARgamma-independent mechanism , which can be conferred to a partial inhibition of P25963 degradation .
