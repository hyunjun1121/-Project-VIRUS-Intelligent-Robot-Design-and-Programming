Prefilled certolizumab pegol ( Cimzia(®) ) syringes for self-use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . A new anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -α ) inhibitor with a novel mechanism of action has entered phase 3 trials in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB08904 ( Cimzia(®) ) is a humanized Fab ' antibody fragment against P01375 -α with a polyethylene glycol tail that prevents complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or apoptosis . Four randomized clinical trials have been published so far . Reported results are similar to those published in previous studies with other P01375 -α inhibitors , with ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70 responses of around 60 % , 40 % , and 20 % , respectively , when combined with methotrexate and slightly lower when used as monotherapy . Safety was shown to be similar to that seen with P01375 -α blockers and some cases of tuberculosis were seen in the trials , stressing the importance of a complete screening in these patients . Although we still need effectiveness and safety data in larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up , this new P01375 inhibitor is a welcome addition to our current armamentarium for the treatment of RA .
