Light and X-ray scattering show decorin to be a dimer in solution . P07585 is a widely distributed member of the extracellular matrix small leucine-rich repeat glycoprotein/proteoglycan family . For investigation of its physical properties , decorin from two sources ( young steer skin and a recombinant adenovirus ) was used . The first sample was extracted into 7 m urea and purified , while the second was isolated from medium conditioned by 293A cells infected with adenovirus and purified without chaotropes . The only chemical differences detected between these materials were a slightly shorter glycosaminoglycan chain and the retention of the propeptide on the latter . Circular dichroism spectra of the two samples were virtually identical , showing a high proportion of beta-sheet and beta-turn and little alpha-helix . The protein cores were completely denatured in 2.25 m guanidine HCl ( GdnHCl ) but recovered their secondary structure on removal of chaotrope . Light scattering of material eluted from gel-filtration columns in DB03754 -buffered saline , pH 7.0 , gave molecular mass values of 165 +/- 1 kDa and 84.6 +/- 4 kDa for intact decorin and the glycoprotein core produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase , respectively . Intact recombinant prodecorin had a mass of 148 +/- 18 kDa . These values , which are double those estimated from SDS gel electrophoresis or from the known sequences and compositions , were halved in 2.5 m GdnHCl . Data from solution x-ray scattering of intact decorin and its core in DB03754 -buffered saline are consistent with a dimeric particle whose protein component has a radius of gyration of 31.6 +/- 0.4 A , a maximum diameter of 98 +/- 5 A , and approximates two intertwined C shapes .
