Targeting interleukin-6 in inflammatory autoimmune diseases and cancers . P05231 ( P05231 ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with significant functions in the regulation of the immune system . As a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine , P05231 plays a pivotal role in host defense against pathogens and acute stress . However , increased or deregulated expression of P05231 significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of various human diseases . Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have revealed the pathological roles of the P05231 pathway in inflammation , autoimmunity , and cancer . Based on the rich body of studies on biological activities of P05231 and its pathological roles , therapeutic strategies targeting the P05231 pathway are in development for cancers , inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . Several anti- P05231 / P05231 receptor monoclonal antibodies developed for targeted therapy have demonstrated promising results in both preclinical studies and clinical trials . DB06273 , an anti- P05231 receptor antibody , is effective in the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions notably rheumatoid arthritis . It is the only P05231 pathway targeting agent approved by the regulatory agencies for clinical use . DB09036 , an anti- P05231 antibody , has been shown to have potential benefits treating various human cancers either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs . Several other anti- P05231 -based therapies are also under clinical development for various diseases . P05231 antagonism has been shown to be a potential therapy for these disorders refractory to conventional drugs . New strategies , such as combination of P05231 blockade with inhibition of other signaling pathways , may further improve P05231 -targeted immunotherapy of human diseases .
