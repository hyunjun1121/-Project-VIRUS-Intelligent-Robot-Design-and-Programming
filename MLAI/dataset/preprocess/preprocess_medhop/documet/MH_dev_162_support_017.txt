A 9-year-old male with a duplication of chromosome 3p25.3p26.2 : clinical report and gene expression analysis . We describe a 9-year-old male referred for genetic evaluation for Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . PWS is the most common genetically defined cause of life-threatening obesity and results from a functional loss of paternally expressed genes from the chromosome 15q11-q13 region . The patient presented with pervasive developmental disorder , delayed speech , and rapid onset of obesity at age 4 years , all features similar to PWS . However , chromosome 15q11-q13 methylation testing and fragile X studies were normal . GTG-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) with whole chromosome 3 paint probe ( WCP3 ) and a chromosome 3p subtelomeric probe suggested a duplication of 3p25.3p26.2 , a finding supported by comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . This region of chromosome 3p contains genes which contribute to obesity and behavioral problems , most notably , ghrelin ( Q9UBU3 ) , an oxytocin receptor ( P30559 ) , solute carrier family six members ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) neurotransmitter transporters , P30531 and P48066 ) , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( P37231 ) . To characterize these obesity and behavior related genes in our subject , we performed quantitative RT-PCR and compared expression levels with similarly aged male subjects ( four non-obese males , four obese males , and four PWS males-two with 15q11-q13 deletions and two with maternal disomy 15 ) . Our studies suggest increased expression of several genes in the 3p duplication region , including Q9UBU3 and P37231 , which may contribute to the phenotypic features in our 3p duplication subject .
