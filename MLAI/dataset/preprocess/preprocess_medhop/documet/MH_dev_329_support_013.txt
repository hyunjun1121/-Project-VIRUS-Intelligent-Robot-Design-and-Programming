Q9UEF7 gene deficiency causes salt-sensitive hypertension via monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CC chemokine receptor 2-mediated inflammation . Q9UEF7 ( KL ) is a newly discovered aging suppressor gene . In mice , the KL gene extends the lifespan when overexpressed and shortens the lifespan when disrupted . This study investigated if KL deficiency affects BP and salt sensitivity using KL mutant heterozygous ( +/- ) mice and wild-type ( WT ) mice ( 9 weeks of age , 16 mice per group ) . Notably , systolic BP in KL(+/-) mice began to increase at the age of 15 weeks , reached a peak level at the age of 17 weeks , and remained elevated thereafter , whereas systolic BP remained consistent in WT mice . High salt ( HS ) intake further increased BP in KL(+/-) mice but did not affect BP in WT mice . Blockade of CC chemokine receptor 2 ( P41597 ) , involved in monocyte chemotaxis , by a specific P41597 antagonist ( DB05130 ) abolished the HS-induced increase in BP in KL(+/-) mice . Furthermore , HS loading substantially increased the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the infiltration of macrophages and T cells in kidneys in KL(+/-) mice , and treatment with DB05130 abolished these effects . Treatment of KL(+/-) mice with DB05130 also attenuated the increased renal expressions of serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 , thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter , and DB00171 synthase Î² along with the renal structural damage and functional impairment induced by HS loading . In conclusion , KL deficiency caused salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage by P41597 -mediated inflammation .
