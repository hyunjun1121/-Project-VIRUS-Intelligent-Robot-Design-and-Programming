Chemokine production and leukocyte recruitment to the lungs of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis-infected mice is modulated by interferon-gamma . Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a role in cell recruitment during granulomatous inflammatory reactions . Here , we evaluated the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors and their regulation by P01579 in the course of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ( Pb ) infection in mice . We found an association between KC and MIP-1alpha ( P10147 ) production and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of Pb-infected mice during the early acute phase of infection . High levels of RANTES/ P13501 , P13500 / P13500 , P02778 / P02778 , and Mig/ Q07325 simultaneously with mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs was found . In the absence of P01579 ( GKO mice ) we observed increased production of KC and MIP-1alpha and chronic neutrophilia . Moreover , we found a change in the chemokine receptor profiles expressed by wild-type ( WT ) versus GKO animals . Increased expression of P49682 and P51681 , and low levels of P51677 and CCR4 were observed in the lungs of Pb-infected WT mice , whereas the opposite effect was observed in the lungs of GKO mice . Consistent with these results , infected cells from WT mice preferentially migrated in response to P02778 ( P49682 ligand ) , while those from GKO mice migrated in response to eotaxin/ P51671 ( P51677 ligand ) . These results suggest that P01579 modulates the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors as well as the kind of cells that infiltrate the lungs of Pb-infected mice .
