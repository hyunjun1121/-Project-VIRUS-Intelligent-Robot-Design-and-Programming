Purine receptor Q15077 mediates cellular response to γ-ray-induced DNA damage . We previously showed that nucleotide P2 receptor agonists such as DB00171 and UTP amplify γ-ray-induced focus formation of phosphorylated histone H2A variant P16104 ( γ P16104 ) , which is considered to be an indicator of DNA damage so far , by activating purine Q15077 and Q9H244 receptors . Therefore , we hypothesized that these P2 receptors play a role in inducing the repair response to γ-ray-induced DNA damage . In the present study , we tested this idea by using human lung cancer A549 cells . First , reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed that Q15077 receptor is highly expressed in A549 cells , but Q9H244 receptor is only weakly expressed . Next , colony formation assay revealed that Q15077 receptor antagonist MRS2578 markedly reduced the survival rate of γ-ray-exposed A549 cells . The survival rate was also significantly reduced in Q15077 -knock-down cells , compared with scramble siRNA-transfected cells . Since it has reported that phosphorylation of P27361 /2 after activation of P00533 via Q15077 and Q9H244 receptors is involved in the repair response to γ-ray-induced DNA damage , we next examined whether γ-ray-induced phosphorylation of P27361 /2 was also inhibited by MRS2578 in A549 cells . We found that it was . Taken together , these findings indicate that purinergic signaling through Q15077 receptor , followed by P27361 /2 activation , promotes the cellular repair response to γ-ray-induced DNA damage .
