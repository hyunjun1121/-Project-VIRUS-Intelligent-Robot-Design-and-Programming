Differential actions of vasopeptidase inhibition versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on diuretic therapy in experimental congestive heart failure . BACKGROUND : DB00886 ( OMA ) , a vasopeptidase inhibitor , simultaneously inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) and neutral endopeptidase , which degrades vasodilatory factors ( eg , P35318 ) and natriuretic peptides . Based on the beneficial cardiorenal and humoral properties of the natriuretic peptides , we hypothesized that an acute vasopeptidase inhibitor with or without diuretic would result in more favorable cardiorenal and hormonal actions than P12821 inhibition plus diuretic ( ACEI+D ) in congestive heart failure . METHODS AND RESULTS : We compared the actions of OMA alone and with diuretic ( OMA+D ) to ACEI+D in a model of pacing-induced congestive heart failure . OMA+D decreased pulmonary arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures to a greater level than OMA alone or ACEI+D . Glomerular filtration rate was lower with ACEI+D than with either OMA group . Plasma renin activity and aldosterone immediately increased with ACEI+D , whereas OMA+D resulted in higher plasma renin activity and a delayed increase in aldosterone . OMA alone did not increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone , but resulted in a sustained increase in plasma adrenomedullin , with higher urinary atrial natriuretic peptide , adrenomedullin , and cGMP excretions than with ACEI+D . CONCLUSIONS : Acute administration of OMA with or without diuretic results in more favorable cardiorenal and humoral responses in experimental congestive heart failure than does ACEI+D . There is no acute activation of renin and aldosterone with OMA alone such as occurs with ACEI+D and OMA+D . Thus , OMA with or without a diuretic possesses beneficial cardiorenal and humoral actions comparable to those observed with ACEI+D that can be explained by potentiation of natriuretic peptides .
