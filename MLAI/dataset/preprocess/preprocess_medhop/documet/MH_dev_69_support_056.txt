Dopamine D1 , D2 and D3 receptor genes in alcohol dependence . Hereditary factors play a substantial role in the etiology of alcohol dependence . DB00898 mediates its reinforcing effects by an activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system . These findings suggest that the genes encoding the dopamine receptor ( DR ) subtypes represent high-ranking candidates for susceptibility genes to addictive disorders . Our present population-based association study investigated whether sequence variants of the dopamine D1 , D2 and D3 receptor genes confer susceptibility to alcohol dependence in 278 alcoholics , and clinically more homogeneous subgroups ascertained through positive family history , early age at onset , delirium , withdrawal seizures and antisocial tendencies . No evidence for an allelic association was found for the PCR-based TaqA RFLP fo the P14416 gene and a Bsp1286I RFLP of the P21728 gene . Without correction for multiple testing , we found a significantly increased allele frequency of a common P35462 gene variant expressing a serine at position 9 in the extracellular N-terminal part of the receptor protein in 55 alcohol-dependent individuals with delirium ( chi 2 = 4.1 , df = 1 , p = 0.042 ) . Further studies have to examine whether this amino acid substitution or a nearby mutation confers genetic susceptibility to at least a subgroup of alcohol-dependent individuals with delirium .
