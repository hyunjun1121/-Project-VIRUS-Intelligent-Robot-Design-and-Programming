Peroxisome-proliferator activator receptor-gamma activation decreases attachment of endometrial cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells in an in vitro model of the early endometriotic lesion . The aim of this study was to investigate whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma activation has an effect on the attachment of endometrial cells to peritoneal mesothelial cells in a well-established in vitro model of the early endometriotic lesion . The endometrial epithelial cell line EM42 and mesothelial cell line LP9 were used for this study . EM42 cells , LP9 cells or both were treated with the P37231 agonist ciglitazone ( CTZ ) at varying concentrations ( 10 , 20 and 40 microM ) x 48 h with subsequent co-culture of EM42 and LP9 cells . The rate of EM42 attachment and invasion through LP9 cells was then assessed and compared with control ( EM42 and LP9 cells co-cultured without prior treatment with CTZ ) . Next , attachment of CTZ-treated and untreated EM42 cells to hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , a cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) on peritoneal mesothelial cells , were assessed . Although there was no difference in EM42 attachment when LP9 cells alone were treated with CTZ , treatment of EM42 cells with 40 microM CTZ decreased EM42 attachment to LP9 cells by 27 % ( P < 0.01 ) . Treatment of both EM42 and LP9 cells with 40 microM CTZ decreased EM42 attachment to LP9 by 37 % ( P < 0.01 ) . Treatment of EM42 cells with 40 microM CTZ decreased attachment to HA by 66 % ( P = 0.056 ) . CTZ did not decrease invasion of EM42 cells through the LP9 monolayer . CTZ may inhibit EM42 cell proliferation . In conclusion , CTZ significantly decreased EM42 attachment to LP9 cells and HA in an in vitro model of the early endometriotic lesion .
