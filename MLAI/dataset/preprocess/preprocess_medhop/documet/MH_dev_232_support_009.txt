Mechanism of inhibition of the P42262 AMPA receptor channel opening by talampanel and its enantiomer : the stereochemistry of the 4-methyl group on the diazepine ring of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives . Stereoselectivity of 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds provides a unique way for the design of stereoisomers as more selective and more potent inhibitors as drug candidates for treatment of the neurological diseases involving excessive activity of AMPA receptors . Here we investigate a pair of enantiomers known as DB04982 and its ( + ) counterpart about their mechanism of inhibition and selectivity toward four AMPA receptor subunits or P42261 -4 . We show that DB04982 is the eutomer with the endismic ratio being 14 for the closed-channel and 10 for the open-channel state of P42262 . Kinetic evidence supports that DB04982 is a noncompetitive inhibitor and it binds to the same site for those 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds with the C-4 methyl group on the diazepine ring . This site , which we term as the " M " site , recognizes preferentially those 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds with the C-4 methyl group being in the R configuration , as in the chemical structure of DB04982 . Given that DB04982 inhibits P42261 and P42262 , but is virtually ineffective on the P42263 and P48058 AMPA receptor subunits , we hypothesize that the " M " site(s) on P42261 and P42262 to which DB04982 binds is different from that on P42263 and P48058 . If the molecular properties of the AMPA receptors and DB04982 are used for selecting an inhibitor as a single drug candidate for controlling the activity of all AMPA receptors in vivo , DB04982 is not ideal . Our results further suggest that addition of longer acyl groups to the N-3 position should produce more potent 2,3-benzodiazepine inhibitors for the " M " site .
