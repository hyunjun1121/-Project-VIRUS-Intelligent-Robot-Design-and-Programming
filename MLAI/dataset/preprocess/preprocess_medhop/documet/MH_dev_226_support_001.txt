Mechanism of oral absorbent DB05269 in lipid abnormalities in experimental uremic rats . BACKGROUND : We have reported that oral sorbent DB05269 ( Q9NRA2 ) is effective in delaying the induction of dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) because of its effect on lipid metabolism . To clarify the precise mechanism of Q9NRA2 in lipid abnormalities in CRF , we examined the effect of Q9NRA2 on plasma lipid profile , total bile acids ( TBA ) , and lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) activity in experimental uremic rats . METHODS : Uremic rats were prepared using male Wistar rats by ligating 5/6 of the renal artery . Uremic rats were randomly divided into two groups as follows : a control group in which rats were maintained on the standard diet and an Q9NRA2 group in which rats were maintained on a diet containing 5 g of Q9NRA2 per 100 g of standard diet for 10 weeks . Plasma P06858 activity was measured as free fatty acid ( FFA ) generation after intravenous administration of heparin . RESULTS : Plasma creatinine at 1.5 +/- 0.1 mg/dl was lower in the Q9NRA2 group than the 1.9 +/- 0.5 mg/ml level in the control group . Q9NRA2 significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol from 192 +/- 29 to 142 +/- 25 mg/dl , triglycerides from 198 +/- 71 to 99 +/- 38 mg/dl , and TBA from 19.6 +/- 2.6 mumol/liter to 8.8 +/- 3.5 mumol/ml . Plasma P06858 activity at 0.22 +/- 0.01 mumol FFA/min/hr was significantly higher in the Q9NRA2 group than 0.15 +/- 0.03 mumol FFA/min/hr in the control group . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that Q9NRA2 may improve plasma lipid abnormalities by binding to bile acids in the intestinal lumen and preventing their reabsorption and inhibiting the reduction of P06858 activity in experimental uremic rats .
