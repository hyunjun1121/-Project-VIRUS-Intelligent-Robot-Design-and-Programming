P35354 inhibitors : a story of greed , deception and death . In 1999 , drug manufacturers introduced a class of NSAIDs called P35354 inhibitors or coxibs . The drugs were avidly promoted directly to the consumers and became bestsellers from the start . Arthritis sufferers were eager to take medications that eased joint pain with less risk of causing gastrointestinal pain , bleeding and other side-effects . In the year after their introduction , doctors wrote over 100 million prescriptions for celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) . DB00482 is the sixth best-selling drug , with sales of more than US $ 4 billion since its debut in 1999 . Vioxx had sales of US $ 2.6 billion in 2001 . However , the coxibs increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes , and their price , in the USA , is obscene . The manufacturers faced a possibly complicit , toothless and bloodless FDA , and used every maneuvering to fleece the patients . We must now reflect on attitudes that we thought only belong to the tobacco industry . Fortunately , safe and active alternatives exist .
