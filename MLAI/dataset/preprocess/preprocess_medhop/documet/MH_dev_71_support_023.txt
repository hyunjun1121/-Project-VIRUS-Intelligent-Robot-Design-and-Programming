[ Presynaptic P08908 receptors in immunomodulation ] . It is shown that a selective agonist of P08908 receptors 8-OH-DPAT in a low dose ( 0.1 mg/kg ) , which is known to affect mainly the presynaptic P08908 receptors increased the immune response at the peak of reactions ( the forth or fifth day after immunization with sheep red blood cells - SRBC ) in CBA mice and Wistar rats . Treatment of the animals with the drug 15 min prior to antigen injection raised the number of plaque-forming cells ( lgM- P27918 ) and rosette-forming cells ( P41440 ) in the spleen . The preliminary blockade of P08908 receptor with a selective antagonist of P08908 receptors WAY-100635 ( 0.1 mg/kg ) prevented the immunostimulating effect of 5-HT 1A receptors agonist 8-OH-DPAT , whereas WAY-100635 administration alone in the same dose did n't change the immune response . Activation of P08908 receptors under conditions of electrical lesion of 5-HTergic neurons of the nucleus raphe was unable to enhance the immune reactions , as it did in sham-operated rats . The data obtained indicate that the somatodendric P08908 autoreceptors are involved in immunomodulation .
