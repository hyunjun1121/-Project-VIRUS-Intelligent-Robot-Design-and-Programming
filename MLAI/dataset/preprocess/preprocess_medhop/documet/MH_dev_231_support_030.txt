The role of P05362 /LFA-1 and P19320 /VLA-4 interactions on T helper 2 cytokine production by lung T cells of Toxocara canis-infected mice . In order to study the effect of costimulatory signals on T helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cytokine production , monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) against cell adhesion molecules ( P62158 ) were added to cells in culture obtained from the lungs of Toxocara canis ( Tc ) -infected mice followed by the determination of interleukin-5 ( P05113 ) and P05112 in the supernatants of the culture . ES-stimulated P05113 production in the supernatant of total lung cells was reduced by 25 % when anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( anti- P05362 ) mAb , anti-CD11a mAb , or both anti- P05362 and anti-CD11a mAb together were added to the culture . The addition of anti- P05107 mAb had no effects . Anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( anti- P19320 ) mAb addition also reduced P05113 production by 60 % , although the addition of anti-very late activation antigen-4 ( anti-VLA-4 ) mAb or both anti- P19320 and anti-VLA-4 mAb together were less effective . In the case of anti-CD3 mAb stimulation , similar effects of mAb to P62158 were observed . In contrast , P05112 production induced by anti-CD3 mAb was reduced more markedly by the addition of either anti- P05362 or anti-CD11a mAb than the combination of anti- P19320 and anti-VLA-4 mAb . Similar effects of mAb to P62158 were observed on the production of P05113 and P05112 by P01730 + T cells purified using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter . Coincubation with adherent cells was necessary for the significant production of P05113 and P05112 by P01730 + T cells . These results suggest that the P19320 /VLA-4 interaction is more important for P05113 production by P01730 + T cells in the lungs of Tc-infected mice , and that the P05362 /lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 interaction is more important for the production of P05112 .
