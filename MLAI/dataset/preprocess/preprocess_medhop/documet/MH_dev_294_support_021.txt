Mechanism of bradykinin-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells . BACKGROUND : The effect of bradykinin on intracellular free Ca(2+) levels ( [Ca(2+)](i) ) in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells was explored using fura-2 as a Ca(2+) dye . METHODS/RESULTS : Bradykinin ( 0.1 nM-1 microM ) increased [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 0.5 nM . The [Ca(2+)](i) signal comprised an initial peak and a fast decay which returned to baseline in 2 min . Extracellular Ca(2+) removal inhibited the peak [Ca(2+)] ( i ) signals by 35 +/- 3 % . Bradykinin ( 1 nM ) failed to increase [Ca(2+)](i) in the absence of extracellular Ca ( 2+ ) after cells were pretreated with thapsigargin ( an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor ; 1 microM ) . Bradykinin ( 1 nM ) -induced intracellular Ca(2+) release was nearly abolished by inhibiting phospholipase C with 2 microM 1- ( 6- ( ( 17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl ) amino ) hexyl ) -1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione ( U73122 ) . The [Ca(2+)] ( i ) increase induced by 1 nM bradykinin in Ca(2+)- free medium was abolished by 1 nM DB06196 ( a P30411 antagonist ) but was not altered by 100 nM Des- DB00125 - DB06196 ( a P46663 antagonist ) . Pretreatment with 1 pM pertussis toxin for 5 h in Ca(2+) medium inhibited 30 +/- 3 % of 1 nM bradykinin-induced peak [Ca(2+)](i) increase . CONCLUSIONS : Together , this study shows that bradykinin induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases in a concentration-dependent manner , by stimulating B2 bradykinin receptors leading to mobilization of Ca(2+) from the thapsigargin-sensitive stores in a manner dependent on inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate , and also by inducing extracellular Ca(2+) influx . The bradykinin response was partly coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein pathway .
