DB06186 augments antitumor activity of bispecific antibody-armed T cells . BACKGROUND : DB06186 is an antagonistic monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 ( P16410 ) that enhances antitumor immunity by inhibiting immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) . In this study , we investigated whether inhibiting Treg activity with ipilimumab during ex vivo T cell expansion could augment anti-CD3-driven T cell proliferation and enhance bispecific antibody ( BiAb ) -redirected antitumor cytotoxicity of activated T cells ( ATC ) . METHODS : PBMC from healthy individuals were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody with or without ipilimumab and expanded for 10-14 days . ATC were harvested and armed with anti-CD3 x anti- P00533 BiAb ( EGFRBi ) or anti-CD3 x anti- P11836 BiAb ( CD20Bi ) to test for redirected cytotoxicity against COLO356/FG pancreatic cancer cell line or Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line ( Daudi ) . RESULTS : In PBMC from healthy individuals , the addition of ipilimumab at the initiation of culture significantly enhanced T cell proliferation ( p = 0.0029 ) . ATC grown in the presence of ipilimumab showed significantly increased mean tumor-specific cytotoxicity at effector:target ( E:T ) ratio of 25:1 directed at COLO356/FG and Daudi by 37.71 % ( p < 0.0004 ) and 27.5 % ( p < 0.0004 ) , respectively , and increased the secretion of chemokines ( P13500 , P10147 , P13236 , P13501 , Q07325 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(GM- P04141 ) ) and cytokines ( IFN-Î³ , IL-2R , IL-12 , and P35225 ) , while reducing P22301 secretion . CONCLUSIONS : Expansion of ATC in the presence of ipilimumab significantly improves not only the T cell proliferation but it also enhances cytokine secretion and the specific cytotoxicity of T cells armed with bispecific antibodies .
