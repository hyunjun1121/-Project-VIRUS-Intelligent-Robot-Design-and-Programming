DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel activation induces angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo . Intense research is conducted to identify new molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis . Previous studies have shown that the angiogenic effects of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) depend on the activation of DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels ( KATP ) and that P23582 ( P09543 ) , which can act through KATP , promotes endothelial cell growth . We therefore investigated whether direct KATP activation induces angiogenic responses and whether it is required for the endothelial responses to P09543 or vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . Chick chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) angiogenesis was similarly enhanced by the direct KATP channel activator 2-nicotinamidoethyl acetate ( SG-209 ) and by P09543 or P15692 . The KATP inhibitors glibenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoate ( 5-HD ) reduced basal and abolished P09543 -induced P62158 angiogenesis . In vitro , the direct KATP openers nicorandil and SG-209 and the polypeptides P15692 and P09543 increased proliferation and migration in bEnd.3 mouse endothelial cells . In addition , P15692 and P09543 induced cord-like formation on Matrigel by human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . All these in vitro endothelial responses were effectively abrogated by glibenclamide or 5-HD . In HUVECs , a small-interfering RNA-mediated decrease in the expression of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel ( Kir ) 6.1 subunit impaired cell migration and network morphogenesis in response to either SG-209 or P09543 . We conclude that 1 ) direct pharmacologic activation of KATP induces angiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo , 2 ) angiogenic responses to P09543 and P15692 depend on KATP activation and require the expression of the Kir6.1 KATP subunit , and 3 ) KATP activation may underpin angiogenesis to a variety of vasoactive stimuli , including H2S , P15692 , and P09543 .
