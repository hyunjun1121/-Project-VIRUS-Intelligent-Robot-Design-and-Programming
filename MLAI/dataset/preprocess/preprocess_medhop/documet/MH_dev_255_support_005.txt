DB06589 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma . Dramatic advances in the care of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma have occurred over the last ten years , including insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease , that have now been translated into paradigm-changing therapeutic strategies . Elucidating the importance of signaling cascades related to angiogenesis is notable among these achievements . DB06589 is a novel small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets P17948 , -2 , and -3 ; P09619 -α , P09619 -β ; and c-kit tyrosine kinases . This agent exhibits a distinct pharmacokinetic profile as well as toxicity profile compared to other agents in the class of P15692 signaling pathway inhibitors . This review will discuss the scientific rationale for the development of pazopanib , as well as preclinical and clinical trials that led to approval of pazopanib for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma . The most recent information , including data from 2010 national meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology , and the design of ongoing Phase III trials , will be discussed . Finally , an algorithm utilizing Level I evidence for the treatment of patients with this disease will be proposed .
