Histone deacetylase inhibitors as potential therapeutic approaches for chordoma : an immunohistochemical and functional analysis . Chordomas are rare malignancies of the axial skeleton . Therapy is mainly restricted to surgery . This study investigates histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors as potential therapeutics for chordomas . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) was performed using the HDAC 1-6 antibodies on 50 chordoma samples ( 34 primary tumors , 16 recurrences ) from 44 patients ( 27 male , 17 female ) . Pan-HDAC-inhibitors DB02546 ( DB02546 ) , DB06603 ( LBH-589 ) , and Belinostat ( PXD101 ) were tested for their efficacy in the chordoma cell line MUG-Chor1 via Western blot , cell cycle analysis , caspase 3/7 activity ( MUG-Chor1 , UCh-1 ) , cleaved caspase-3 , and PARP cleavage . p-Values below 0.05 were considered significant . IHC was negative for Q13547 , positive for Q92769 in most ( n = 36 ; 72 % ) , and for HDACs 3-6 in all specimens available ( n = 43 ; 86 % ) . Q9UBN7 expression was strongest . DB02546 and LBH-589 , but not PXD101 caused a significant increase of G2/M phase cells and of cleaved caspase-3 ( p = 0.0003 , and p = 0.0014 after 72 h , respectively ) , and a peak of caspase 3/7 activity . PARP cleavage confirmed apoptosis . The presented chordoma series expressed HDACs 2-6 with strongest expression of Q9UBN7 . DB02546 and LBH-589 significantly increased apoptosis and changed cell cycle distribution in vitro . HDAC-inhibitors should be further evaluated as therapeutic options for chordoma .
