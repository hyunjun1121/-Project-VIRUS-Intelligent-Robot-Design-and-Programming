Leishmania major protein disulfide isomerase as a drug target : enzymatic and functional characterization . Leishmaniasis is a major health problem worldwide and tools available for their control are limited . Effective vaccines are still lacking , drugs are toxic and expensive , and parasites develop resistance to chemotherapy . In this context , new antimicrobials are urgently needed to control the disease in both human and animal . Here , we report the enzymatic and functional characterization of a Leishmania virulence factor , Leishmania major Protein disulfide isomerase ( LmPDI ) that could constitute a potential drug target . LmPDI possesses domain structure organization similar to other P07237 family members ( a , a ' , b , b ' and c domains ) , and it displays the three enzymatic and functional activities specific of P07237 family members : isomerase , reductase and chaperone . These results suggest that LmPDI plays a key role in assisting Leishmania protein folding via its capacity to catalyze formation , breakage , and rearrangement of disulfide bonds in nascent polypeptides . Moreover , DB00626 , a reductase activity inhibitor , and DB03615 , a chaperone activity inhibitor , were tested in LmPDI enzymatic assays and versus Leishmania promastigote in vitro cultures and Leishmania amastigote multiplication inside infected THP-1-derived macrophages . DB00626 inhibited both isomerase and reductase activities , while DB03615 had no effect on the chaperone activity . Interestingly , DB00626 blocked in vitro promastigote growth as well as amastigote multiplication inside macrophages with EC(50) values of 39 Î¼M . These results suggest that LmPDI may constitute an interesting target for the development of new anti-Leishmania drugs .
