A double-blind , placebo-controlled outpatient trial of pergolide for cocaine dependence . Results of preclinical studies suggest that pergolide , a mixed D(1)/ P14416 agonist , may be useful in treating cocaine dependence . To empirically investigate this possibility , we conducted a 5-year , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial of two doses of pergolide ( 0.05 and 0.25 mg bid ) in subjects with cocaine dependence and combined cocaine/alcohol dependence . Data analysis was performed on an intent to treat population ( N=358 ) and a per protocol population ( N=108 ) with urine drug screens ( UDS ) used as the main outcome measure . There were no significant effects on UDS at either pergolide dose . DB01186 had no significant effect on alcohol use in the comorbid alcohol/cocaine dependence group . DB01186 does not appear to have clinical value in the treatment of cocaine dependence or in decreasing alcohol use in cocaine-dependent individuals at the presently studied doses .
