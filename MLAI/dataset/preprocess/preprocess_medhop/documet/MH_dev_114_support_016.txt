NPC 15669 , an inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment , is efficacious in acetic acid-induced colitis in rats . BACKGROUND : The efficacy of the leukocyte recruitment inhibitor , N- [ 9H-2,7-dimethylfluoren-9-ylmethoxy ) carbonyl ] -L-leucine ( NPC 15669 ) was compared with drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases in a rat model , acetic acid-induced colitis . METHODS : Colonic damage assessed by visual inspection , histological quantitation of tissue injury , vascular permeability , myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) accumulation , and synthesis of inflammatory mediators were measured . RESULTS : Intrarectal pretreatment with NPC 15669 results in a significant reduction of all measured indices of inflammation . The median effective dose ( ED50 ) of NPC 15669 for inhibition of P05164 accumulation and vascular permeability is 13.2 mg/kg and 31 mg/kg , respectively . The active moiety of sulfasalazine , DB00244 ( DB00244 ) , the antioxidant/ P09917 inhibitor , nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA ) and the corticosteroids dexamethasone and hydrocortisone , yielded ED50 values ( P05164 accumulation ) of 68 mg/kg , 95 mg/kg , 0.7 mg/kg , and 13 mg/kg , respectively . When formulated suspensions of NPC 15669 , DB00244 , or dexamethasone were used , potency was increased 10-40-fold . Furthermore , NPC 15669 ( 10 mg/kg ) administered 7 hours after acetic acid and evaluated 24 hours after acetic acid administration significantly attenuated neutrophil influx ( 70 % inhibition of P05164 accumulation ) , whereas DB00244 ( 100 mg/kg ) displayed no therapeutic effects . CONCLUSIONS : NPC 15669 may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders .
