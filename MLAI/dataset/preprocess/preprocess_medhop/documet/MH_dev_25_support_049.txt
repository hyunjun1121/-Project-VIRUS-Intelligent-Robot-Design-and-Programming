DB06681 in clinical and experimental transplantation - progress and promise . DB06681 is a fusion protein composed of the Fc fragment of a human IgG(1) immunoglobulin linked to the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( P16410 ) . P16410 is a molecule crucial for T-cell costimulation , selectively blocking the process of T-cell activation . DB06681 binds surface costimulatory ligands ( P33681 and P42081 ) of antigen-presenting cells . Studies on nonhuman primates , as well as phase II and III clinical trials are here reviewed . DB06681 is a promising therapy in organ transplantation and in the future can be used to induce tolerance .
