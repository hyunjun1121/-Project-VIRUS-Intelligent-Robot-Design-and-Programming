Effect of valproic acid through regulation of DB01221 receptor- P29323 signaling in sleep deprivation rats . Although the effect of mood stabilizer valproic acid ( DB00313 ) through multiple signaling pathways has been shown , its therapeutic mechanism is still largely unknown . We investigated the effect of DB00313 ( 200 mg/kg , every 12 h ) in sleep deprivation ( SD ) rats ( 72 h ) , the manic-like animal model , focusing on the N-methyl-D : -aspartic acid ( DB01221 ) receptor and signaling mediators of synaptic plasticity such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) , DB02527 response element-binding protein ( CREB ) , B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 ( P10415 ) , and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) . SD reduced the expression of the Q13224 subunit of the DB01221 receptor in the frontal cortex and hippocampus but did not affect the expression of Q9UHB4 and Q12879 subunits . In comparison , DB00313 inhibited the SD-induced reduction of Q13224 expression in both brain regions . In addition , SD attenuated P29323 phosphorylation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus , whereas DB00313 prevented the attenuation . DB00313 also protected the SD-induced decrease of CREB phosphorylation , P10415 expression , and P23560 expression in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus . These results indicate that DB00313 could regulate DB01221 receptor- P29323 signaling in SD rats , preventing the SD-induced decrease of the expression of Q13224 subunit and the activation of P29323 signaling mediators such as P29323 , CREB , P10415 , and P23560 .
