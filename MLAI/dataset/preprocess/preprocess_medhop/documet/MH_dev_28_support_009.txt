Lasting controversy on ranibizumab and bevacizumab . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , an important angiogenic factor that is able to stimulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells , is the best-studied hallmark of angiogenesis . Neovascularization is a major cause of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) which is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly population . Specific molecular inhibitors of P15692 have been proved to be useful in the treatment of AMD . DB01270 and DB00112 are structurally similar to anti- P15692 drugs in the treatment of AMD . Many studies have indicated that DB01270 and DB00112 are of roughly equal short-term efficacy and safety , DB00112 is an attractive alternative to DB01270 due to its lower cost . However , only DB01270 has received Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval for the treatment of macular degeneration . More multicenter clinical trials are required to compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two drugs and some progress has been achieved . This review discusses the clinical effectiveness , safety , cost and other practical implications of DB01270 and DB00112 .
