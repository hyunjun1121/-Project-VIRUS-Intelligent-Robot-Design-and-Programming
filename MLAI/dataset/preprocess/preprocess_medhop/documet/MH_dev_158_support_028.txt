Modulation of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels ( Review ) . Ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels ( ryanodine receptors , RyRs ) play a crucial role in the mobilization of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) during the excitation-contraction coupling of muscle cells . In skeletal muscle , depolarization of transverse tubules activates the RyR , whereas in cardiac muscle , a Ca2+ influx through an L-type Ca2+ channel activates the RyR . The RyR is also activated by caffeine , a low concentration ( < 10 µM ) of ryanodine or cyclic ADP-ribose . RyR activity is inhibited by Mg2+ , ruthenium red , or higher concentrations ( ≥100 µM ) of ryanodine . The activity of RyR channels is modulated by phosphorylation and by associated proteins , including calmodulin ( P62158 ) , calsequestrin ( CSQ ) and FK506-binding proteins ( FKBPs ) . In muscle cells , apoCaM ( Ca2+-free P62158 ) activates the RyR channel , and Ca2+ P62158 ( Ca2+-bound P62158 ) inhibits the channel . CSQ can bind approximately 40 moles of Ca2+/mole of CSQ in the SR lumen of muscle cells , and interacts functionally with RyR protein . When the RyR is stimulated , Ca2+ released from the lumen is dissociated from the CSQ- Ca2+ complex . A 12-kDa or 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein ( P62942 or P68106 , respectively ) is associated with RyR protein . When P62942 or P68106 is dissociated from the FKBP-RyR complex , the RyR is modulated ( activated ) . Phosphorylation of the RyR by DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II modulates the channel . PKA phosphorylation of the RyR on the skeletal and cardiac muscle SR dissociates P62942 or P68106 from the RyR complex . This review deals with the modulation mechanisms of RyR proteins by associated proteins and phosphorylation .
