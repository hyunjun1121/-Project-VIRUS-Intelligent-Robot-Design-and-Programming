Growth rates of hprt and tk mutant CHO cell lines . The growth rates of 31 X-ray-induced hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( hprt ) deficient mutants of CHO- P04264 cells were measured . Mutants had been classified as ( 1 ) full-deletion , ( 2 ) partial deletion or rearrangement , or ( 3 ) unchanged by Southern blot analyses . No relationship between growth rate and deletion type was observed . Even where all hprt-specific bands were missing , proliferation rates in culture were normal . Additionally , in CHO- P01008 -2 cells , which are heterozygous at the tk locus , no difference in growth rates between a spontaneous hprt mutant and its parent was observed , although double hprt-tk-/- mutants grew more slowly .
