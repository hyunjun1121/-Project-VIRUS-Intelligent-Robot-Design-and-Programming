DB06681 : a new era of immunosuppression ? Q8N1N2 T-cell activation in alloimmunity requires the engagement of several costimulatory molecules . P16410 -Ig and its commercially available fusion proteins , belatacept and abatacept , are used to block P33681 /86 and promote T-cell tolerance . DB06681 , a higher binding affinity molecule , is currently approved for clinical use in renal transplantation . The results of two Phase III clinical trials showed a similar patient/graft survival , with better renal function at a 3-year follow-up compared with conventional immunosuppression . There was a higher risk of early rejection and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder , especially with EBV-negative patients receiving kidneys from EBV-positive donors . DB06681 -treated groups had a better cardiovascular and metabolic profile . The authors review both preclinical and human studies of P16410 -Igs .
