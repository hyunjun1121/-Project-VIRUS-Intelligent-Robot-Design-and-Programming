Reopening of DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels reduces neuropathic pain and regulates astroglial gap junctions in the rat spinal cord . DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels are suggested to be involved in pathogenesis of neuropathic pain , but remain underinvestigated in primary afferents and in the spinal cord . We examined alterations of K( DB00171 ) channels in rat spinal cord and tested whether and how they could contribute to neuropathic pain . The results showed that protein expression for K( DB00171 ) channel subunits Q09428 , SUR2 , and Kir6.1 , but not Kir6.2 , were significantly downregulated and associated with thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia after sciatic nerve injury . Spinal administration of a K( DB00171 ) channel opener cromakalim ( CRO , 5 , 10 , and 20 μg , respectively ) prevented or suppressed , in a dose-dependent manner , the hyperalgesia and allodynia . Nerve injury also significantly increased expression and phosphorylation of connexin 43 , an astroglial gap junction protein . Such an increase of phosphorylation of connexin 43 was inhibited by CRO treatment . Furthermore , preadministration of an astroglial gap junction decoupler carbenoxolone ( 10 μg ) completely reversed the inhibitory effects of CRO treatment on the hyperalgesia and allodynia and phosphorylation of Q9UHB4 and Q13224 receptors and the subsequent activation of Ca(2+)-dependent signals Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( DB02527 ) response element binding protein . These findings suggest that nerve injury-induced downregulation of the K( DB00171 ) channels in the spinal cord may interrupt the astroglial gap junctional function and contribute to neuropathic pain , thus the K( DB00171 ) channels opener can reduce neuropathic pain probably partly via regulating the astroglial gap junctions . This study may provide a new strategy for treating neuropathic pain using K( DB00171 ) channel openers in the clinic .
