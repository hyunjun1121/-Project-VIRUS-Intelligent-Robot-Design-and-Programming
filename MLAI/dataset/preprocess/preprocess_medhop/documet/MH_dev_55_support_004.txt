Anti-inflammatory effects of troglitazone in nondiabetic obese subjects independent of changes in insulin sensitivity . BACKGROUND : Obesity is characterised by insulin resistance and by elevated levels of proinflammatory markers . We investigated whether , in the absence of changes in glucose , thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) have anti-inflammatory effects and whether improvement of insulin sensitivity correlates with suppression of inflammatory markers . METHODS : We performed a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study with troglitazone ( 400 mg daily for eight weeks ) in 15 normoglycaemic obese subjects . We measured plasma high-sensitivity P02741 ( hsCRP ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , leptin , tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) after each of the two treatment periods and in 13 age- and sex-matched lean individuals . RESULTS : Obese subjects were insulin resistant ( decreased glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp ) and had higher plasma levels of hsCRP , P05231 , leptin , tPA , and P05121 compared with lean subjects . P01375 also tended to be higher . DB00197 improved insulin sensitivity ( mean increase in whole body glucose uptake 23.1 +/- 10.5 % ( p = 0.047 ) ) and normalised plasma concentrations of hsCRP , tPA and P01375 , whereas it did not significantly change P05231 , leptin and P05121 . Changes in GIR did not correlate with changes in inflammatory markers . CONCLUSION : DB00197 induces suppression of some of the inflammatory markers that are elevated in normoglycaemic obese subjects . The suppression of inflammatory markers , however , does not correlate with improvement in insulin sensitivity , suggesting involvement of partially differential mechanisms in these effects of TZDs .
