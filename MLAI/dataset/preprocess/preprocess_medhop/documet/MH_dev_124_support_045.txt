The anti-proliferative effects of DB00136 on breast and prostate cancer cells are associated with induction of P38398 gene expression . The anti-proliferative action of the seco-steroid hormone 1alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] extends to some , but not all breast and prostate cancer cell lines . By elucidating the molecular mechanisms mediating the sensitivity of these cells , we can identify critical target genes regulated directly or indirectly by DB00136 and pathways potentially disrupted during transformation . In this study , we demonstrated the induction of expression of P38398 mRNA and protein as well as transcriptional activation from the P38398 -promoter by DB00136 in the sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 . This was not observed in the DB00136 -resistant breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436 . The induction of P38398 mRNA was blocked by cyclohexamide . This indicated that transcriptional activation was mediated indirectly by the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) . Inhibition of P11473 protein levels by stable transformation of the anti-sense P11473 in MCF-7 reduced the sensitivity of MCF-7 to DB00136 by 50-fold . In addition , the induction of P38398 protein and transcriptional activation of a P38398 promoter-luciferase reporter construct was abrogated in the stable transformant with the greatest reduction of P11473 levels . Examination of other breast and prostate cancer cell lines revealed that sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects of 1alpha , 25(OH)2D3 was strongly associated with an ability to modulate P38398 protein . Furthermore , the expression of the estrogen receptor in these cell lines strongly correlated with their sensitivity to DB00136 and their ability to modulate P38398 expression . Taken together , our data support a model whereby the anti-proliferative effects of DB00136 are mediated , in part , by the induction of P38398 gene expression via transcriptional activation by factors induced by the P11473 and that this pathway is disrupted during the development of prostate and breast cancers .
