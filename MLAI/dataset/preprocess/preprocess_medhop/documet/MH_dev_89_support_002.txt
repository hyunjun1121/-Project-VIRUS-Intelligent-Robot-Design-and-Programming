The P35372 promotes opioid and growth factor-induced proliferation , migration and Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) in human lung cancer . Recent epidemiologic studies implying differences in cancer recurrence based on anesthetic regimens raise the possibility that the mu opioid receptor ( MOR ) can influence cancer progression . Based on our previous observations that overexpression of MOR in human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells increased tumor growth and metastasis , this study examined whether MOR regulates growth factor receptor signaling and epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in human NSCLC cells . We utilized specific siRNA , shRNA , chemical inhibitors and overexpression vectors in human H358 NSCLC cells that were either untreated or treated with various concentrations of DAMGO , morphine , fentanyl , P01133 or IGF . Cell function assays , immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays were then performed . Our results indicate MOR regulates opioid and growth factor-induced P01133 receptor signaling ( Src , Gab-1 , PI3K , Akt and P40763 activation ) which is crucial for consequent human NSCLC cell proliferation and migration . In addition , human NSCLC cells treated with opioids , growth factors or MOR overexpression exhibited an increase in snail , slug and vimentin and decrease ZO-1 and claudin-1 protein levels , results consistent with an EMT phenotype . Further , these effects were reversed with silencing ( shRNA ) or chemical inhibition of MOR , Src , Gab-1 , PI3K , Akt and P40763 ( p < 0.05 ) . Our data suggest a possible direct effect of MOR on opioid and growth factor-signaling and consequent proliferation , migration and EMT transition during lung cancer progression . Such an effect provides a plausible explanation for the epidemiologic findings .
