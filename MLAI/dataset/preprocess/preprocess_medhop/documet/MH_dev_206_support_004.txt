Signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 ( P42224 ) , but not STAT5b , regulates P08069 gene expression in an osteosarcoma cell line . The P08069 ( IGF-IR ) exhibits potent mitogenic , antiapoptotic , and transforming activities . Previous studies have suggested that the expression of the IGF-IR gene is negatively regulated by certain cytokines , including interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . The potential involvement of P35610 proteins in transcriptional regulation of the IGF-IR gene by P01579 was addressed by transient coexpression of vectors encoding P42224 and STAT5b , together with an IGF-IR promoter luciferase reporter , in the osteosarcoma-derived cell line Saos-2 . Physical interactions between P01579 -induced transcription factors and the IGF-IR promoter region were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) . The results obtained indicate that the mechanism of action of P01579 involves stimulation of P42224 which , in turn , binds P01579 activation sites ( GAS ) in the IGF-IR regulatory region , thus suppressing promoter activity . Taken together , our results suggest that the IGF-IR gene is a novel target for P42224 action and that at least part of the inhibitory effects of P42224 may involve repression of the strongly antiapoptotic IGF-IR gene .
