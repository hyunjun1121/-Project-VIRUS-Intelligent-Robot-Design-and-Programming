Effect of metoclopramide , ondansetron and granisetron on aldosterone secretion in man . The plasma aldosterone response following the administration of drugs with antagonist and agonist activity at Serotonin 3 and 4 ( 5- Q9H205 & 4 ) receptors has been examined in 9 healthy male volunteers receiving the following four treatments i.v. in a randomised , cross-over sequence : ondansetron 8 mg , granisetron 3 mg , metoclopramide 20 mg , and saline 20 ml . DB01233 significantly increased the mean plasma aldosterone level to 196 % of basal level at 5 min . It rose to 234 % at 15 min and remained at more than 185 % of basal level for the duration of the experiment . The response to ondansetron and granisetron did not differ significantly from placebo . If dopamine antagonism is discounted , the results suggest that metoclopramide-induced aldosterone secretion results from its agonist activity at Q13639 receptors , although slow neuronal depolarization via an unidentified receptor remains a possibility . Antagonism at the 5- Q9H205 receptor plays no role , as the selective antagonist , granisetron , did not elicit a significant response . It seems unlikely that the Q13639 receptor is the second , low affinity binding site of ondansetron , unless it had no agonist activity at this receptor .
