Specific Biomarkers Are Associated with Docetaxeland Gemcitabine-Resistant NSCLC Cell Lines . Five-year survival rate for lung cancer is limited to 10 % to 15 % . Therefore , the identification of novel therapeutic prognostic factors is an urgent requirement . The aim of this study is thus to highlight specific biomarkers in chemoresistant non-small cell lung cancer cell lines . Therefore , we checked-in the control condition as well as after short-term pharmacological treatment with either docetaxel or gemcitabine-the expression of genes such as tumor suppressor genes ( CDKN2A , P53355 , P49789 , P09211 , P16455 , RARÎ²2 , RASSF1A , and P35625 ) , genes associated with drug resistance ( P38398 , P35354 , P07992 , P17936 , P23921 , and Q13509 ) , and stemness-related genes ( CD133 , Q01860 , and O43623 ) in two cellular models of squamous carcinoma ( CAEP ) and adenocarcinoma ( RAL ) of the lung originally established . Their promoter methylation profile was also evaluated . Drug-related genes were upregulated . DB00515 resistance matched with high levels of P38398 and P07992 in both cell lines ; docetaxel sensitivity of CAEP cells was associated to levels of Q13509 lower than RAL cells . Although CAEP cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine , both cell lines showed high levels of P23921 . Stemness-related genes were downregulated in the control condition but became upregulated in docetaxel-resistant cells , indicating the selection of a population with stemness features . We did not find an unequivocal correspondence between gene expression and respective DNA promoter methylation status , suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms of gene expression regulation . These results highlight specific biomarkers consistent with the different responses of the two cell lines to standard pharmacological treatments and indicate specific molecular traits for their chemoresistance .
