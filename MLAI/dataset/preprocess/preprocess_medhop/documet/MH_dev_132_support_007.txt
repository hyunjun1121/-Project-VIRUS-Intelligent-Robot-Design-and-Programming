Vascular endothelial growth factor expression and glomerular endothelial cell loss in the remnant kidney model . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is constitutively expressed in the glomerulus where it may have a role in the maintenance of capillary endothelial cell integrity . The present study sought to examine changes in P15692 expression in a model of progressive renal disease and to assess the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibition . METHODS : Subtotal nephrectomized ( STNx ) rats were randomly assigned to receive vehicle ( n=10 ) or the P12821 inhibitor perindopril ( 8 mg/l drinking water ) for 12 weeks duration ( n=10 ) . Sham-operated rats were used as controls ( n=10 ) . Glomerular capillary endothelial cell density was evaluated by immunostaining for the pan-endothelial cell marker Q06609 -1 and P15692 expression was assessed by quantitative in situ hybridization . RESULTS : In STNx rats glomerular capillary endothelial cell density was reduced to 19 % that of sham rats ( P < 0.01 ) with a concomitant reduction in glomerular P15692 expression , also to 19 % of sham rats ( P < 0.01 ) . DB00790 treatment was associated with normalization of both capillary endothelial cell density and glomerular P15692 mRNA . CONCLUSIONS : Reduction in glomerular P15692 expression is a feature of the renal pathology that follows subtotal nephrectomy . In the context of the known functions of this growth factor , these findings suggest that diminution in P15692 may contribute to the demonstrated loss of glomerular endothelium that develops in this model of progressive renal disease .
