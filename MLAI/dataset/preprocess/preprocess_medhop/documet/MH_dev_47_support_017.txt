The JAK inhibitor , tofacitinib , reduces the T cell stimulatory capacity of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells . OBJECTIVE : DB08895 , which is a Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , has shown clinical effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . JAKs are important kinases in lymphocyte differentiation ; however , their function in dendritic cells ( DCs ) is unknown . In this study , the function of JAKs in DCs was investigated with tofacitinib . METHODS : The effects of tofacitinib on the maturation of human monocyte-derived DCs induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation were investigated . In addition , its effects on T cell stimulatory capability was investigated by coculturing with naïve CD45RA-positive T cells . RESULTS : DB08895 decreased expression of P33681 / P42081 in a concentration-dependent manner in LPS-stimulated DCs ; however , it did not affect HLA-DR expression . DB08895 suppressed tumour necrosis factor , interleukin ( IL ) -6 and IL-1β production without affecting transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β and P22301 production . Meanwhile , P33681 / P42081 expression in DCs was enhanced by type I interferon ( IFN ) stimulation , and the LPS-induced P33681 / P42081 expression was inhibited by an antibody to type I IFN receptor . Furthermore , tofacitinib suppressed production of type I IFN and activation of interferon regulatory factor ( Q969Q1 ) -7 , which is a transcription factor involved in P33681 / P42081 and type I IFN expression . DB08895 also decreased the T cell stimulatory capability of DCs and increased expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( P14902 ) -1 and Q6ZQW0 . CONCLUSIONS : DB08895 , a P23458 / P52333 inhibitor , affected the activities of human DCs . It decreased P33681 / P42081 expression and T cell stimulatory capability through suppression of type I IFN signalling . These results suggest a novel mode of action for tofacitinib and a pivotal role for JAKs in the differentiation of DCs .
