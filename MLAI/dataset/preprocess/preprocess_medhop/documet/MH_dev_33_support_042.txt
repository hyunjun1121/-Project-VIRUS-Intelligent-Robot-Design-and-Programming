Microenvironment of the murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 : endogenous P01579 affects tumor phenotype , growth , and metastasis . P01579 has a profound influence on growth and metastasis of solid tumors . This is true for the murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 which grows faster and metastasizes much more readily when transplanted into the mammary fatpads of P01579 (-/-) mice . We were interested in determining which infiltrating hematopoietic cells produce P01579 within the 4T1 tumor microenvironment . 4T1 tumors were infiltrated with progressively increasing numbers of F4/80(+)/CD11c(+) myeloid cells , many of which were also Gr-1(+) , and Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) granulocytes . Only small numbers of P01730 T cells , CD8 T cells , NK cells , and gammadelta T cells , the most likely P01579 -producing cells , were seen at any time point . Sensitive intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry revealed no tumor-infiltrating hematopoietic cells with detectable levels of intracellular P01579 , although P01579 mRNA transcripts were detected in tumor tissue . However , a progressive increase in the expression of three P01579 -inducible surface membrane proteins ( Q9NZQ7 , I-A(d) , and P05362 ) on growing 4T1 tumor cells indicated the presence of biologically active P01579 in the tumor microenvironment . Moreover , 4T1 tumor cells from in vitro culture expressed these surface molecules 48 h after intratumoral injection into mature tumors . These data suggest that very low amounts of endogenous P01579 elaborated by infiltrating hematopoietic cells within the microenvironment of a solid tumor can achieve biologically active concentrations and affect tumor phenotype , growth , and metastasis .
