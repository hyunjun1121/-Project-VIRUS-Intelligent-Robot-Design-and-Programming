The use of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ( DB06802 ) in an ocular and metastatic animal model of uveal melanoma . The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) has been reported as an indicator of poor prognosis in a wide variety of human tumors , including colon , breast and uveal melanoma ( UM ) . P35354 inhibitors have shown promise in controlling the malignancy of several types of tumors . Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a P35354 inhibitor on the proliferation rates of human UM cells . The goal of this experiment was to investigate the efficiency of DB06802 , a topically administered P35354 inhibitor , in a rabbit model of UM . The animals were divided into two groups of 14 animals for the duration of the 12-week experiment . One animal per group was killed each week to evaluate disease progression and for histopathological studies . The experimental group received drops containing 0.3 % DB06802 solution . Intraocular tumor growth was evaluated weekly by fundoscopic examination and each animal was weighed prior to examination . Blood samples were taken weekly from all rabbits to detect circulating malignant cells ( CMCs ) throughout the experiment . After the second week of inoculation , the experimental group weighed significantly more than the control group . The control group developed more intraocular tumors and presented with metastases and higher detectable levels of CMCs before the treated group . These results indicate that the topical administration of a P35354 inhibitor delayed the progression of this malignancy in our animal model . A clinical trail using an anti- P35354 inhibitor for patients with UM should be considered .
