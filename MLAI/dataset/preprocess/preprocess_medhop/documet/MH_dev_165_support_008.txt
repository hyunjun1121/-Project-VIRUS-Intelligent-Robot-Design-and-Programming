Genome-wide association study identifies genetic determinants of warfarin responsiveness for Japanese . DB00682 is a commonly used anticoagulant , whose dose needs to be determined for each individual patient owing to large inter-individual variability in its therapeutic dose . Although several clinical and genetic variables influencing warfarin dose have been identified , uncovering additional factors are critically important for safer use of warfarin . Through a genome-wide association study , we identified single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs2108622 [ cytochrome P450 , family 4 , subfamily F , polypeptide 2 ( P78329 ) ] as a genetic determinant of warfarin responsiveness for Japanese . Stratifying subjects who have been pre-classified according to the genotypes of SNP rs10509680 [ cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily C , polypeptide 9 ( P11712 ) ] and SNP rs9923231 [ vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ( Q9BQB6 ) ] , based on their genotypes of rs2108622 allowed identification of subjects who require higher dose of warfarin . Incorporating genotypes of rs2108622 into a warfarin dosing algorithm that considers age , body surface area , status of amiodarone co-administration and genotypes of SNPs in the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes improved the model 's predictability to 43.4 % . In this study , the association of P78329 with warfarin dose of the Japanese has been established for the first time . Besides , a warfarin dosing algorithm that incorporates genotypes of rs2108622 and amiodarone co-administration status was suggested for the Japanese . Our study also implied that common SNPs other than those in the P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P78329 genes that show strong effect on the therapeutic warfarin dose might not exist .
