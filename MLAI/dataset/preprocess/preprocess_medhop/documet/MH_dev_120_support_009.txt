[ Hyperlipidemia and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -- regulation of the PPARalpha gene by O15516 : O00327 ] . The main pathological findings in atherosclerosis include abnormal reactions of neutrophils , lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages , vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells , and the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial wall . Therefore , investigating the effects of these abnormal reactions on the arterial wall may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis . Three types of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) : PPARalpha , PPARbeta/delta , and PPARgamma are expressed in endothelial cells . In endothelial cells , the ligands/activators for PPARalpha and PPARgamma increase Cu2+ , DB01593 -superoxide dismutase . In addition , the phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) -stimulated 22 kDa-subunit ( P13498 ) protein levels and 47 kDa-subunit ( p47phox ) protein levels in NADPH ( superoxide generating enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( reduced form ) ) oxidase were decreased by treatment with PPARalpha and PPARgamma ligands/activators . Recently , we showed that the O15516 : O00327 heterodimer regulates the PPARalpha gene via promoter of PPARalpha . Moreover , we report a patient with severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with anemia and hypoalbuminemia , in which the former may have caused the latter two conditions . This is the first reported case of abrupt onset of severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting in suppression of bone marrow and liver function . Here , based on recent studies including our own , we describe the relationships between risk factors for atherosclerosis , especially hyperlipidemia and PPARs and the molecular mechanisms that govern lipid metabolism in the arteries .
