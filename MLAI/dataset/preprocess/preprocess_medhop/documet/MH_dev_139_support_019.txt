Retinal gene expression and Müller cell responses after branch retinal vein occlusion in the rat . PURPOSE : In a rat model of branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) , changes in gene expression of factors implicated in the development of retinal edema and alterations in the properties of Müller cells were determined . METHODS : In adult Long-Evans rats , BRVO was induced by laser photocoagulation of retinal veins ; untreated eyes served as controls . The mRNA levels of after factors were determined with real-time RT-PCR in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium after 1 and 3 days of BRVO : P15692 , pigment epithelium-derived factor ( P36955 ) , tissue factor , prothrombin , the potassium channel Kir4.1 , and aquaporins 1 and 4 . DB01345 currents were recorded in isolated Müller cells , and cellular swelling was assessed in retinal slices . RESULTS : In the neural retina , the expression of P15692 was upregulated within 1 day of BRVO and returned to the control level after 3 days . P36955 was upregulated in the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium after 3 days of BRVO . P00734 , Kir4.1 , and both aquaporins were downregulated in the neuroretina . After BRVO , Müller cells displayed a decrease in their potassium currents and an altered distribution of Kir4.1 protein , an increase in the size of their somata , and cellular swelling under hypoosmotic stress that was not observed in control tissues . CONCLUSIONS : BRVO results in a rapid transient increase in the expression of P15692 and a delayed increase in the expression of P36955 . The downregulation of Kir4.1 and aquaporins , the mislocation of Kir4.1 protein , and the osmotic swelling of Müller cells may contribute to the development of edema and neuronal degeneration .
