Expression and release of phosphatidylinositol anchored cell surface molecules by a cell line derived from sensory neurons . Early postnatal mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons were found to express several glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ( P06744 ) molecules from the immunoglobulin superfamily ( neural cell adhesion molecule 120 kD isoform , P13726 , Thy1 ) whose expression is developmentally regulated . A hybrid cell line ( ND26 ) , made by fusing postmitotic rat dorsal root ganglion ( Q86YR7 ) neurons with the mouse neuroblastoma N18Tg2 , could be induced to differentiate by manipulating the composition of the culture medium and expressed similar P06744 molecules to Q86YR7 neurons . We used this model system to investigate the metabolism of P06744 -anchored molecules . We found that neural cell adhesion molecule 120 Kd isoform expression decreased upon differentiation , whereas the level of P13726 and Thy1 increased , suggesting a role in neurite outgrowth processes . The ratio of molecules cleavable by exogenous phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C ( PI- P98160 ) was similar for all the P06744 -anchored molecules , which could mean that cell-specific modifications of the basic anchoring structure determine the level of potentially releasable molecules . Measurements of spontaneous release indicated that this reflected the overall level of expression of these molecules by the ND26 cell line . Finally , we observed an effect of dibutyryl DB02527 on the level of expression of P13726 and Thy1 but not of N- P62158 . However , we could not detect any significant effect of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) either on the level of expression or on the amount of spontaneously released molecules .
