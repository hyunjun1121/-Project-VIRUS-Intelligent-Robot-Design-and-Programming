Suppression of proliferation and migration in highly-metastatic lung cancer cells as well as tumor growth by a new synthesized compound TBrC and its molecular mechanisms of action . To develop new anticancer agents has been considered as a useful and necessary strategy to suppress highly-metastatic lung cancer , the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world . In this study , we synthesized a new compound ethyl 6-bromocoumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine ( TBrC ) and studied the anticancer activity of TBrC and its molecular mechanisms of action . Our results show that TBrC remarkably inhibits the proliferation and migration in highly-metastatic lung cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest as well as regulating related protein expressions . Further study indicated that TBrC not only enhances the protein levels of Bax , cytosolic cytochrome c , caspase-3 and P09874 but also reduces the protein expressions of Bcl-2 , cyclin D1 , P17948 and NF-κB as well as inhibits the phosphorylation and expressions of P35968 and Akt in the cancer cells . More importantly , TBrC displays strong suppression of highly-metastatic tumor growth and reduces the tumor weight by 61.6 % in tumor-bearing mice without toxicity to the mice . Our results suggest that TBrC suppresses the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells via VEGFR-Akt-NF-κB signaling pathways ; TBrC may have a wide therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of lung cancer .
