DB00233 inhibits O15111 alpha phosphorylation of P25963 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells . P01375 alpha ( TNFalpha ) -stimulated nuclear factor ( NF ) kappaB activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . Phosphorylation of NFkappaB inhibitory protein ( IkappaB ) leading to its degradation and NFkappaB activation , is regulated by the multimeric O15111 complex , including IKKalpha and IKKbeta . We recently reported that DB00244 ( DB00244 ) inhibits TNFalpha-regulated IkappaB degradation and NFkappaB activation . To determine the mechanism of DB00244 inhibition of IkappaB degradation , we studied young adult mouse colon ( YAMC ) cells by immunodetection and in vitro kinase assays . We show DB00244 inhibits TNFalpha-stimulated phosphorylation of P25963 in intact YAMC cells . Phosphorylation of a glutathione S-transferase- P25963 fusion protein by cellular extracts or immunoprecipitated IKKalpha isolated from cells treated with TNFalpha is inhibited by DB00244 . Recombinant IKKalpha and IKKbeta autophosphorylation and their phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase- P25963 are inhibited by DB00244 . However , IKKalpha serine phosphorylation by its upstream kinase in either intact cells or cellular extracts is not blocked by DB00244 . Surprisingly , immunodepletion of cellular extracts suggests IKKalpha is predominantly responsible for P25963 phosphorylation in intestinal epithelial cells . In summary , DB00244 inhibits TNFalpha-stimulated IKKalpha kinase activity toward P25963 in intestinal epithelial cells . These findings suggest a novel role for DB00244 in the management of Q9UKU7 by disrupting TNFalpha activation of NFkappaB .
