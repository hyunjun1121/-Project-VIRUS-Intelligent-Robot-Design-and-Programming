Regulation and role of urokinase plasminogen activator in vascular remodelling . 1. DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) is produced and secreted by multiple vascular cell types , thus influencing the processes and the extent to which the vasculature is remodelled during the development of the intima or a neointima and during hypertrophy and angiogenesis . 2 . DB00013 plasminogen activator mRNA expression is up- and down-regulated by growth factors , cytokines and steroids . DB00013 plasminogen activator is secreted as a single chain inactive form that may be proteolytically converted to active or inactive forms . Targeting of proteolytic activity may occur via focalized expression of uPA and its cell surface receptors ( Q03405 ) . Proteolytic activity is also controlled through the often co-ordinated expression of specific inhibitors . 3 . A proteolytic cascade involving uPA provides its major role in tissue remodelling through the primary degradation of extracellular matrix and secondarily through the activation of transforming growth factor-beta or release from the matrix of basic fibroblast growth factor . In addition , uPA secreted by growth factor-stimulated vascular cells may contribute to the chemotactic and mitogenic responses ascribed to the growth factor and recent evidence strongly suggests that uPA has direct biological actions on vascular cells . 4 . The cell surface binding of uPA via its growth factor-like domain to Q03405 localizes and activates the protease , but may also initiate transmembrane signalling of biological responses , including migration/invasion and proliferation . As the Q03405 lacks intracellular signalling domains , the signals may be transduced via interactions between uPA/ Q03405 and more classical signalling receptors . The mechanism by which uPA may be involved in cell signalling is yet to be elucidated .
