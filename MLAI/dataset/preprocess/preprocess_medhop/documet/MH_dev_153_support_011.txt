P01308 signal transduction pathways and insulin-induced gene expression . P01308 regulates metabolic activity , gene transcription , and cell growth by modulating the activity of several intracellular signaling pathways . P01308 activation of one mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade , the MEK/ P29323 kinase cascade , is well described . However , the effect of insulin on the parallel p38 pathway is less well understood . The present work examines the effect of inhibiting the p38 signaling pathway by use of specific inhibitors , either alone or in combination with insulin , on the activation of P27361 /2 and on the regulation of gene transcription in rat hepatoma cells . Activation of P27361 /2 was induced by insulin and was dependent on the activation of Q02750 , the kinase upstream of P29323 in this pathway . Treatment of cells with p38 inhibitors also induced P27361 /2 activation/phosphorylation . The addition of p38 inhibitors followed by insulin addition resulted in a greater than additive activation of P27361 /2 . The two genes studied , c-Fos and Pip92 , are immediate-early genes that are dependent on the P27361 /2 pathway for insulin-regulated induction because the insulin effect was inhibited by pretreatment with a Q02750 inhibitor . The addition of p38 inhibitors induced transcription of both genes in a dose-dependent manner , and insulin stimulation of both genes was enhanced by prior treatment with p38 inhibitors . The ability of the p38 inhibitors to induce P27361 /2 and gene transcription , both alone and in combination with insulin , was abolished by prior inhibition of Q02750 . These data suggest possible cross-talk between the p38 and P27361 /2 signaling pathways and a potential role of p38 in insulin signaling .
