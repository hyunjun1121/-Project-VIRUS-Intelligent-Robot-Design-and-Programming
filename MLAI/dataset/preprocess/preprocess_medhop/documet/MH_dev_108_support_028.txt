Golimumab in unresponsive ulcerative colitis . Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a chronic inflammation mainly affecting the colon mucosa . It predominantly occurs in younger patients . Until recently , the main goals in the treatment of UC were to temper the symptoms , such as diarrhea , pain , and weight loss , by using mesalazine and steroids . With newer medications , such as immunomodulators ( thiopurines ) and the biologics providing blockade of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) , the goals of the therapy in UC have changed to long-term remission and mucosal healing . The first available anti- P01375 therapy in UC included infusion therapy with infliximab every few weeks . In 2012 , subcutaneously administered adalimumab gained approval for the treatment of UC in Germany . In patients with a mild disease , therapy with mesalazine , orally or topically , can be sufficient . In patients with moderate to severe disease , therapy with azathioprine or anti- P01375 is often required to reach disease control ; however , this is only efficient in about two-thirds of patients . Some patients either show no response or a lost response while on treatment . So , further medical options are warranted in the treatment of UC . With DB06674 , a new approach in the treatment of mild to moderate UC recently became available in Germany and is a promising new option in the therapy regimen for patients with UC .
