Inhibition of histamine H1 receptor activity modulates proinflammatory cytokine production of dendritic cells through c-Rel activity . BACKGROUND : DB11320 exerts diverse effects on immune regulation through four types of histamine receptors ( HRs ) . Among them , type 1 receptor ( P35367 ) plays an important role in allergic inflammation . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , which express at least three types of HRs , are professional antigen-presenting cells controlling the development of allergic inflammation . However , the molecular mechanisms involved in P35367 -mediated NF-ĸB signaling of DCs remain poorly defined . METHODS : Bone-marrow ( BM ) -derived DCs ( BM-DCs ) were treated with P35367 inverse agonists to interrupt basal P35367 -mediated signaling . The crosstalk of P35367 -mediated signaling and the NF-ĸB pathway was examined by NF-ĸB cellular activity using a luciferase reporter assay , NF-ĸB subunit analysis using Western blotting and P01375 -α promoter activity using chromatin immunoprecipitation . RESULTS : Blockage of P35367 signaling by inverse agonists significantly inhibited P01375 -α and P05231 production of BM-DCs . P35367 -specific agonists were able to enhance P01375 -α production , but this overexpression was significantly inhibited by NF-ĸB inhibitor . The P35367 inverse agonist ketotifen also suppressed cellular NF-ĸB activity , suggesting crosstalk between P35367 and NF-ĸB signaling in DCs . After comprehensive analysis of NF-ĸB subunits , c-Rel protein expression was significantly down-regulated in ketotifen-treated BM-DCs , which led to inhibition of the promoter activity of P01375 -α . Finally , adoptive transfer of the ketotifen-treated BM-DCs did not induce significant allergic airway inflammation compared to that of control cells in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that c-Rel controls P35367 -mediated proinflammatory cytokine production in DCs . This study provides a potential mechanism of P35367 -mediated signaling and NF-ĸB pathway crosstalk in allergic inflammation .
