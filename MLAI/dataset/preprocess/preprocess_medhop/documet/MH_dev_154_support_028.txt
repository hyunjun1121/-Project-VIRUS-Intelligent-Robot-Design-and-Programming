DB00013 receptor primes cells to proliferate in response to epidermal growth factor . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) expresses mitogenic activity by a mechanism that requires the P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) . We report that murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) proliferate in response to P01133 only when these cells express the urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) . P00533 expression was equivalent in Q03405 -/- and Q03405 +/+ MEFs . In response to P01133 , these cells demonstrated equivalent overall P00533 tyrosine phosphorylation and P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase activation ; however , phosphorylation of DB00135 -845 in the P00533 , which has been implicated in cell growth , was substantially decreased in Q03405 -/- MEFs . STAT5b activation also was decreased . As DB00135 -845 is a c-Src target , we overexpressed c-Src in Q03405 -/- MEFs and rescued P01133 mitogenic activity . Rescue also was achieved by expressing murine but not human Q03405 , suggesting a role for autocrine Q03405 cell-signaling . In MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells , P01133 mitogenic activity was blocked by Q03405 gene silencing , with antibodies that block uPA-binding to Q03405 , and with a synthetic peptide that disrupts Q03405 -dependent cell signaling . Again , c-Src overexpression rescued the mitogenic activity of P01133 . We conclude that Q03405 -dependent cell-signaling may prime cells to proliferate in response to P01133 by promoting DB00135 -845 phosphorylation and STAT5b activation . The importance of this pathway depends on the c-Src level in the cell .
