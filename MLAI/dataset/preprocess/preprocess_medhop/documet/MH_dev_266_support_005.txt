Neuronal ablation of p-Akt at Ser473 leads to altered P08908 /2A receptor function . The serotonergic system regulates a wide range of behavior , including mood and impulsivity , and its dysregulation has been associated with mood disorders , autism spectrum disorder , and addiction . Diabetes is a risk factor for these conditions . P01308 resistance in the brain is specifically associated with susceptibility to psychostimulant abuse . Here , we examined whether phosphorylation of Akt , a key regulator of the insulin signaling pathway , controls serotonin ( 5-HT ) signaling . To explore how impairment in Akt function regulates 5-HT homeostasis , we used a brain-specific rictor knockout ( KO ) mouse model of impaired neuronal phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 . Cortical P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor binding was significantly elevated in rictor KO mice . Concomitant with this elevated receptor expression , the P08908 receptor agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) led to an increased hypothermic response in rictor KO mice . The increased cortical P08908 receptor density was associated with higher P08908 receptor levels on the cortical cell surface . In contrast , rictor KO mice displayed significantly reduced head-twitch response ( HTR ) to the 5- Q13049 /C agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , with evidence of impaired 5- Q13049 /C receptor signaling . In vitro , pharmacological inhibition of Akt significantly increased P08908 receptor expression and attenuated DOI-induced 5- Q13049 receptor signaling , thereby lending credence to the observed in vivo cross-talk between neuronal Akt signaling and 5-HT receptor regulation . These data reveal that defective central Akt function alters 5-HT signaling as well as 5-HT-associated behaviors , demonstrating a novel role for Akt in maintaining neuronal 5-HT receptor function .
