Blockade of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 attenuates early-life stress-induced synaptic abnormalities in the neonatal hippocampus . Adult individuals with early stressful experience exhibit impaired hippocampal neuronal morphology , synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance . While our knowledge on the persistent effects of early-life stress on hippocampal structure and function and the underlying mechanisms has advanced over the recent years , the molecular basis of the immediate postnatal stress effects on hippocampal development remains to be investigated . Here , we reported that repeated blockade of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 ( P34998 ) ameliorated postnatal stress-induced hippocampal synaptic abnormalities in neonatal mice . Following the stress exposure , pups with fragmented maternal care showed retarded dendritic outgrowth and spine formation in P07451 pyramidal neurons and reduced hippocampal levels of synapse-related proteins . During the stress exposure , repeated blockade of glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs ) by daily administration of DB00834 ( 100 µg g(-1) ) failed to attenuate postnatal stress-evoked synaptic impairments . Conversely , daily administration of the P34998 antagonist antalarmin hydrochloride ( 20 µg g(-1) ) in stressed pups normalized hippocampal protein levels of synaptophysin , postsynaptic density-95 , nectin-1 , and nectin-3 , but not the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits Q9UHB4 and Q12879 . Additionally , GR or P34998 antagonism attenuated postnatal stress-induced endocrine alterations but not body growth retardation . Our data indicate that the P06850 - P34998 system modulates the deleterious effects of early-life stress on dendritic development , spinogenesis , and synapse formation , and that early interventions of this system may prevent stress-induced hippocampal maldevelopment .
