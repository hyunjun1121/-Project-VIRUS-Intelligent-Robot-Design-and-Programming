Repeated , intermittent treatment with amphetamine induces neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma cells ( PC12 cells ) . Repeated , intermittent treatment with amphetamine ( P49418 ) leads to long-term neurobiological adaptations in rat brain including an increased number and branching of dendritic spines . This effect depends upon several different cell types in the intact brain . Here we demonstrate that repeated , intermittent P49418 treatment induces neurite outgrowth in cultured PC12 cells without the requirement for integrated synaptic pathways . PC12 cells were treated with 1 micro M P49418 for 5 min a day , for 5 days . After 10 days of withdrawal , there was an increase in the percentage of cells with neurites ( approximately 30 % ) and the length of neurites as well as an increase in the level of P20936 -43 and neurofilament-M . Neurite outgrowth was enhanced as withdrawal time was increased . Neurite outgrowth was much greater following repeated , intermittent treatment with P49418 compared to continuous or single treatment with P49418 . Pretreatment with cocaine , a monoamine transporter blocker , inhibited the P49418 -mediated increase in neurite outgrowth . Neither P01138 antibody nor DA receptor antagonists blocked P49418 -induced neurite outgrowth , demonstrating that P49418 -induced neurite outgrowth is not dependent on endogenous P01138 release or DA receptors . Thus we have demonstrated that repeated , intermittent treatment with P49418 has a neurotrophic effect in PC12 cells . The effect requires the action of P49418 on the norepinephrine transporter , and shares characteristics in its development with other forms of sensitization but does not require an intact neuroanatomy .
