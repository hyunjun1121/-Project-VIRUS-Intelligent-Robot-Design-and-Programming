[ mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in mouse mammary gland in different lactation stages ] . To investigate the expression pattern of lipogenic genes in mammary gland of mouse in different lactation stages , the relative mRNA abundance and expression of 20 genes involved in milk fat synthesis and secretion of lactating mammary tissues were assessed using real-time PCR . Results revealed the significant upregulation of mRNA expression for both high abundant genes ( abundance > 5 % ) , such as P06858 , Q13085 , O00767 , P47989 , Q13410 , and Q99541 and moderate abundant genes ( 5 % > abundance > 1 % ) , such as P16671 , P49327 , Q86UL3 , and O75907 in lactation stages compared to pregnancy ( P < 0.05 ) . The mRNA expression of lipogenic enzyme genes for Q13085 , O00767 , P49327 , Q86UL3 , and O75907 exhibited lower expression lever in early ( 6 d ) and late ( 18 d ) lactation stages but higher expression level at middle stage ( 12 d ) , demonstrating a low-high-low pattern . Besides , the mRNA levels of some gene regulators were also measured . The mRNA expression of SREBF gene increased gradually along with the lactation , which showed a 10-fold elevation at middle stage ( 12 d ) . The expression pattern of SREBF gene was the same as lipogenic enzyme genes , suggesting that SREBF may play an important role in the regulation of lipogenic enzyme genes in the lactating mammary gland .
