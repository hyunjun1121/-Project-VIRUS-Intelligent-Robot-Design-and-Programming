Combined anti-inflammatory effects of β2-adrenergic agonists and DB05876 inhibitors on astrocytes by upregulation of intracellular DB02527 . Inflammation is an important hallmark of all neurodegenerative diseases and activation of different glial populations may be involved in the progression of some of these disorders . Especially , the activation of astroglia can lead to long-term detrimental morphological changes , such as scar formation . Therefore , improved strategies to modulate inflammation in these cells are currently being investigated . We investigated the interaction of phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 4 inhibitors , such as rolipram , with other agents raising cellular DB02527 levels . When used alone , none of the DB05876 inhibitors increased DB02527 levels . The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin , the β(2)-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol and the mixed β(1)/β(2)-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased intracellular DB02527 levels of cortical murine astrocytes . This increase was synergistically elevated by rolipram or the DB05876 inhibitor RO-201724 , but not by inhibition of PDE3 . Inflammatory stimulation of the cells with the cytokines P01375 -α , IL-1β and IFN-γ strongly induced Q07343 and augmented overall DB05876 activity , while PDE3 activity was low . DB01407 and forskolin caused downregulation of cytokines and chemokines such as P05231 and P13500 . This effect was further enhanced by rolipram , but not by the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone . The DB02527 -raising drug combinations attenuated the upregulation of P01375 -α and P05231 mRNA and the secretion of P05231 , but did not affect initial NF-κB signalling triggered by the stimulating cytokines . These results indicate that DB05876 may be a valuable anti-inflammatory target in brain diseases , especially under conditions associated with stimulation of DB02527 -augmenting astrocyte receptors as is observed by clenbuterol treatment .
