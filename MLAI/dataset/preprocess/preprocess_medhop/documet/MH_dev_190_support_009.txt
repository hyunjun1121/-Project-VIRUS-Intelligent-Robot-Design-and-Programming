Serotonin directly stimulates luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone release from GT1 cells via P34969 receptors . DB00044 -releasing hormone ( P01148 release , which serves as the primary drive to the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis , is controlled by many neuromediators . Serotonin has been implicated in this regulation . However , it is unclear whether the central effect of serotonin on P01148 secretion is exerted directly on P01148 neurosecretory neurons or indirectly via multisynaptic pathways . The present studies were undertaken in order to examine whether P01148 secretion from immortalized P01148 cell lines is directly regulated by serotonin and , if so , to identify the receptor subtype involved . 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , a P08908 /7 receptor agonist , stimulated P01148 release from GT1-1 cells . This effect was blocked by ritanserin , a 5-HT2/7 receptor antagonist , but not by SDZ-216-525 , a P08908 antagonist . Basal P01148 release was not affected by the 5-HT2 agonist DOI . Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction technique ( RT-PCR ) was used in order to identify P08908 and P34969 receptor mRNA in immortalized P01148 cell lines . GT1-1 cells express mRNA for the P34969 , but not the P08908 receptor subtypes . These results demonstrate a direct stimulatory effect of serotonin on P01148 release via P34969 receptor .
