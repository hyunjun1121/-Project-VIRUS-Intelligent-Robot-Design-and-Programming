Blockade of interleukin-6 signalling with siltuximab enhances melphalan cytotoxicity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma . Signalling through the interleukin ( IL ) -6 pathway induces proliferation and drug resistance of multiple myeloma cells . We therefore sought to determine whether the P05231 -neutralizing monoclonal antibody siltuximab , formerly CNTO 328 , could enhance the activity of melphalan , and to examine some of the mechanisms underlying this interaction . DB09036 increased the cytotoxicity of melphalan in KAS-6/1 , Q16352 -6 , ANBL-6 , and RPMI 8226 human myeloma cell lines ( HMCLs ) in an additive-to-synergistic manner , and sensitized resistant RPMI 8226.LR5 cells to melphalan . These anti-proliferative effects were accompanied by enhanced activation of drug-specific apoptosis in HMCLs grown in suspension , and in HMCLs co-cultured with a human-derived stromal cell line . DB09036 with melphalan enhanced activation of caspase-8 , caspase-9 , and the downstream effector caspase-3 compared with either of the single agents . This increased induction of cell death occurred in association with enhanced Bak activation . Neutralization of P05231 also suppressed signalling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway , as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of Akt , P08133 S6 kinase and Q13541 . Importantly , the siltuximab/melphalan regimen demonstrated enhanced anti-proliferative effects against primary plasma cells derived from patients with myeloma , monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance , and amyloidosis . These studies provide a rationale for translation of siltuximab into the clinic in combination with melphalan-based therapies .
