P05362 -independent lymphocyte transmigration across high endothelium : differential up-regulation by interferon gamma , tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 beta . The adhesion of lymphocytes to cytokine-treated high endothelium was studied using cultured high endothelial cells ( O14777 ) . Pretreatment of the O14777 layer with a variety of cytokines caused up-regulation of lymphocyte adhesion with the effects ordered interferon gamma ( P01579 ) greater than tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) greater than or equal to interleukin 1 beta ( IL 1 beta ) . Increased lymphocyte adhesion was found to be independent of P05362 as expression by O14777 was not increased by cytokines and antibodies against P05362 did not block adhesion . The peptide CS1 and anti-beta 1 integrin subunit antibodies , however , caused partial inhibition of lymphocyte adhesion thus indicating a role for fibronectin on O14777 and alpha 4 beta 1 on lymphocytes . Study of the kinetics of lymphocyte adhesion showed that the effects of P01579 and P01375 were persistent and remained detectable 2.5 h after removal of the cytokines whereas the effects of IL 1 beta were transient and were not sustained beyond 1 h . All of the cytokines used caused transient increases in the number of surface-bound lymphocytes with P01579 greater than P01375 greater than or equal to IL 1 beta , however , the most dramatic effect was on the transmigration of lymphocytes across the O14777 . Both P01579 and P01375 caused sustained increased transmigration with P01579 having the greater effect . IL 1 beta had little effect on transmigration . This model demonstrates that the binding and transmigration of lymphocytes across O14777 can be differentially regulated by the actions of individual cytokines . These results support the concept that locally produced cytokines regulate O14777 function within the lymph node .
