Blockade of ataxia telangiectasia mutated sensitizes hepatoma cell lines to sorafenib by interfering with Akt signaling . DB00398 is a multi-kinase inhibitor applicable to hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , but its limited therapeutic effects are a major problem to be solved . Here , we show that blockade of ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ) improves the antitumor effects of sorafenib . When hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and P98160 /PRF/5 were treated with sorafenib plus Q13315 small inhibitory RNAs , Q13315 inhibitor KU55933 or caffeine , Akt signaling was suppressed and the cytotoxic effects were significantly potentiated . Moreover , Q13315 inhibition effectively suppressed the sorafenib-induced cell migration . Taken together , manipulation of Q13315 activity might be a useful strategy for improving sorafenib treatment of HCC .
