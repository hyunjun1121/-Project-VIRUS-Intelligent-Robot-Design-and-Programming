P04141 -1 ( P09603 ) delivers a proatherogenic signal to human macrophages . P09603 / P09603 supports the proliferation and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages . In mice , P09603 also promotes proinflammatory responses in vivo by regulating mature macrophage functions , but little is known about the acute effects of this growth factor on mature human macrophages . Here , we show that in contrast to its effects on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages , P09603 did not induce expression of urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA , repress expression of apolipoprotein E mRNA , or prime LPS-induced P01375 and P05231 secretion in human monocyte-derived macrophages ( HMDM ) from several independent donors . Instead , we show by expression profiling that P09603 modulates the HMDM transcriptome to favor a proatherogenic environment . P09603 induced expression of the proatherogenic chemokines P02778 /IFN-inducible protein 10 , P13500 , and P80098 but repressed expression of the antiatherogenic chemokine receptor P61073 . P09603 also up-regulated genes encoding enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway ( P04035 , P53602 , Q13907 , P14324 , Q14534 , Q16850 , EBP , Q15738 , Q9UBM7 , and Q15392 ) , and expression of P45844 , encoding a cholesterol efflux transporter , was repressed . Consistent with these effects , P09603 increased levels of free cholesterol in HMDM , and the selective P07333 kinase inhibitor GW2580 ablated this response . These data demonstrate that P09603 represents a further link between inflammation and cardiovascular disease and suggest two distinct mechanisms by which P09603 , which is known to be present in atherosclerotic lesions , may contribute to plaque progression .
