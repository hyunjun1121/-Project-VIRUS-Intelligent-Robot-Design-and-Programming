Quantitative analysis predicts the relative therapeutic efficacy of different forms of DB01281 . Modulating the activities of costimulatory molecules controlling immune responses holds considerable promise for immunotherapy . DB01281 ( abatacept ) , a soluble version of the T cell-expressed membrane receptor P16410 , is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Like natural P16410 molecules , DB01281 ligates P33681 -1 and P33681 -2 on antigen presenting cells , preventing P10747 -mediated costimulation of T cells . However , DB01281 can also prevent ligation of P16410 , potentially blocking vital inhibitory signals , thereby augmenting immunity . There have been no quantitative analyses of the likely effects of DB01281 on costimulatory interactions at the immunological synapse . We present a mathematical model , based on rigorous biophysical and expression data , for simulating the effects of abatacept and a mutated derivative , DB06681 , on the synaptic interactions of P10747 and P16410 . The simulations reveal an unexpectedly large window within which P10747 , but not P16410 , ligation is blocked by DB01281 , perhaps explaining the efficacy of abatacept at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 10mg/kg ) and its relative safety . However , the simulations suggest that the present dosing regimen is close to the maximum theoretically safe dose . The simulations also show that , within the therapeutic window , DB06681 enhances the interaction of P16410 with the more potent of its two native ligands , P33681 -1 . They also suggest that P16410 ligation by P33681 -1 could , in principle , be enhanced by further decreasing the off-rate of DB01281 for binding to P33681 -2 . Our findings therefore offer molecular explanations for why DB06681 might prove to be more effective than abatacept in a clinical setting , and suggest ways in which its therapeutic efficacy could be further optimised .
