Design , synthesis , and biological evaluation of 3,4-diarylmaleimides as angiogenesis inhibitors . The new analogue 2 of combretastatin A-4 was discovered to be an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization with an IC50 of 7.6 microM and reduced angiogenesis in the in vivo chick embryo model . Interestingly , in a series of 2,3-diarylmaleimides closely related to this lead , no other compound was found to be active in the tubulin polymerization assay . However , by screening in the in vivo chick embryo assay 10 was identified as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor indicating an alternative target . Indeed , molecular modeling studies suggest a reasonable binding mode of 10 at the DB00171 -binding site of the model kinase P24941 . Motivated by these results , analogues of 10 were screened for inhibitory activity in a panel of 12 selected protein kinases and a high affinity of 10 to P15692 -R2 was found showing an IC50 of 2.5 nM . Structure-activity relationships ( SAR ) for this compound series with the isolated enzyme and equivalent antiangiogenic activity in the chick embryo assay are presented herein .
