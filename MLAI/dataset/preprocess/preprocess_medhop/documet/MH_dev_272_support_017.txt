P04150 and histone deacetylase-2 mediate dexamethasone-induced repression of P98088 gene expression . Airway occlusion in obstructive airway diseases is caused in part by the overproduction of secretory mucin glycoproteins through the up-regulation of mucin ( MUC ) genes by inflammatory mediators . Some pharmacological agents , including the glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) , repress mucin concentrations in lung epithelial cancer cells . Here , we show that DB00514 reduces the expression of P98088 , a major airway mucin gene , in primary differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial ( NHBE ) cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and that the DB00514 -induced repression is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and two glucocorticoid response elements ( GREs ) in the P98088 promoter . The pre-exposure of cells to DB00834 , a GR antagonist , and mutations in either the GRE3 or GRE5 cis-sites abolished the DB00514 -induced repression . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays showed a rapid temporal recruitment of GR to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-elements in the P98088 promoter in NHBE and in A549 cells . Immunofluorescence showed nuclear colocalization of GR and histone deacetylase-2 ( Q92769 ) in P98088 -expressing NHBE cells . ChIP also showed a rapid temporal recruitment of Q92769 to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-elements in the P98088 promoter in both cell types . The knockdown of Q92769 by Q92769 -specific short interfering RNA prevented the DB00514 -induced repression of P98088 in NHBE and A549 cells . These data demonstrate that GR and Q92769 are recruited to the GRE3 and GRE5 cis-sites in the P98088 promoter and mediate the DB00514 -induced cis repression of P98088 gene expression . A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids repress P98088 gene expression may be useful in formulating therapeutic interventions in chronic lung diseases .
