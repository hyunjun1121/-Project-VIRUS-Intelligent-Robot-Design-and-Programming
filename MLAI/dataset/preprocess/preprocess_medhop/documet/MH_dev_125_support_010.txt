SNPs in DNA repair genes associated to meningitis and host immune response . In vitro and in animal models , P27695 , O15527 , and P09874 have been proposed as being involved with inflammatory response . In this work , we have investigated if the SNPs P27695 Asn148Glu , O15527 Ser326Cys , and P09874 Val762Ala are associated to meningitis . The patient genotypes were investigated by PIRA-PCR or PCR-RFLP . DNA damages were detected in genomic DNA by Fpg treatment . IgG and IgA were measured from plasma and the cytokines and chemokines were measured from cerebrospinal fluid samples using Bio-Plex assays . A higher frequency ( P < 0.05 ) of P27695 DB00142 allele in bacterial meningitis ( BM ) and aseptic meningitis ( AM ) patients was observed . The genotypes DB00174 / DB00174 in control group and DB00174 / DB00142 in BM group was also higher . For the SNP O15527 Ser326Cys , the genotype DB00151 / DB00151 was more frequent ( P < 0.05 ) in BM group . The frequency of P09874 DB00161 / DB00161 genotype was higher in control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The occurrence of combined SNPs is significantly higher in BM patients , indicating that these SNPs may be associated to the disease . Increasing in sensitive sites to Fpg was observed in carriers of P27695 DB00142 allele or O15527 DB00151 allele , suggesting that SNPs affect DNA repair activity . Alterations in IgG production were observed in the presence of SNPs P27695 Asn148Glu , O15527 Ser326Cys or P09874 Val762Ala . Moreover , reduction in the levels of P05231 , IL-1Ra , P13500 / P13500 and P10145 / P10145 was observed in the presence of P27695 DB00142 allele in BM patients . In conclusion , we obtained indications of an effect of SNPs in DNA repair genes on the regulation of immune response in meningitis .
