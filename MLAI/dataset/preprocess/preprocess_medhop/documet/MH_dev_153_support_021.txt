Tumor suppressor function of P09936 is associated with epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer -- novel predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical surgery . BACKGROUND : The expression level of protein G product 9.5 ( P09936 ) is downregulated because of promoter CpG hypermethylation in several tumors . We speculated that impaired regulation of P09936 through epigenetic pathways is associated with the pathogenesis of prostate cancer . METHODS : CpG methylation of the P09936 gene was analyzed in cultured prostate cancer cell lines , 226 localized prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomy cases , and 80 benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) tissues . RESULTS : Following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidune treatment , increased P09936 mRNA transcript expression was found in the LNCaP and PC3 cell lines . With bisulfite DNA sequencing , partial methylation of the P09936 promoter was shown in LNCaP whereas complete methylation was found in PC3 cells . After transfection of P09936 siRNA , cell viability was significantly accelerated in LNCaP but not in PC3 cells as compared with control siRNA transfection . Promoter methylation of P09936 was extremely low in only one of 80 BPH tissues , whereas it was found in 37 of 226 prostate cancer tissues . Expression of the mRNA transcript of P09936 was significantly lower in methylation ( + ) than methylation ( - ) prostate cancer tissues . Multivariate analysis of biochemical recurrence ( P11274 ) after an radical prostatectomy revealed pT category and P09936 methylation as prognostically relevant . Further stratification with the pT category in addition to methylation status identified a stepwise reduction of P11274 -free probability . CONCLUSION : This is the first clinical and comprehensive study of inactivation of the P09936 gene via epigenetic pathways in primary prostate cancer . Q9P2X3 : CpG methylation of P09936 in primary prostate cancer might become useful as a molecular marker for early clinical prediction of P11274 after radical prostatectomy .
