Accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) in neurons with early stages of Alzheimer 's disease neurofibrillary degeneration . P12004 -dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) is one of the candidate kinases involved in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau . To have a direct effect on tau hyperphosphorylation , cdk5 protein levels and enzyme activity should be upregulated in especially those neurons that develop neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs ) . We studied the distribution of cdk5 immunoreactivity in neurons with or without early- and late-stage NFTs in hippocampal , entorhinal , transentorhinal , temporal and frontal cortices , and cerebellum of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and control brain . The immunocytochemical localisation of cdk5 was compared with that obtained using antibodies to P10636 ( tau in paired helical filaments of NFTs , mAb AT8 ) and ubiquitin as markers of early and late stage NFTs , respectively . Immunoreactivities of cdk5 and P10636 were found in neuronal perikarya and processes of hippocampal , entorhinal , transentorhinal , temporal and frontal , and cerebellar cortices . An apparent increase of cdk5 immunoreactivity was seen in pretangle neurons and in neurons bearing early stage NFTs . These findings suggest that this kinase might be involved in the formation of NFTs at a relatively early stage in the neocortex .
