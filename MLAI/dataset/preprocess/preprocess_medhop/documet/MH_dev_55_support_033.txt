Thiazolidinediones downregulate stearoyl- DB01992 desaturase 1 gene expression in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) are known to have potent increases of insulin sensitivity . Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) , a receptor for TZDs , is mainly expressed in adipocytes , we tried to search the TZD-targeted genes in mouse 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . By the mRNA differential display method , one band repressed by troglitazone was obtained , which corresponded to the partial sequences of the stearoyl- DB01992 desaturase 1 ( SCD1 ) gene . DB00197 dramatically decreased SCD1 mRNA levels in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner . Pioglitazone also repressed the SCD1 mRNA expression , whereas WY-14,643 had no apparent effect . Both troglitazone and pioglitazone raised the composition ( weight percentage ) of myristic acid ( C14:0 ) , palmitic acid ( C16:0 ) , and stearic acid ( C18:0 ) , but lowered the composition of the delta9-cis desaturated fatty acids such as myristoleic acid ( C14:1 , delta9 ) , palmitoleic acid ( C16:1 , delta9 ) , oleic acid ( C18:1 , delta9 ) , and linoleic acid ( C18:2 , delta9,12 ) . These results indicate that TZDs repress SCD1 activity in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes via downregulating SCD1 enzyme gene expression .
