Activation of c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase is crucial for the induction of a cell cycle arrest in human colon carcinoma cells caused by flurbiprofen enantiomers . The unselective cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor DB00712 and its-in terms of P36551 -inhibition- " inactive " enantiomer R-flurbiprofen have been previously found to inhibit tumor development and growth in various animal models . The underlying mechanisms are unknown . Here , we show that both R- and DB00712 reduce survival of three colon cancer cell lines , which differ in the expression of P35354 ( HCT-15 , no P35354 ; Caco-2 , inducible P35354 ; and HT-29 , constitutive P35354 ) . The IC50 for S- and R-flurbiprofen ranged from 250 to 450 microM . Both flurbiprofen enantiomers induced apoptosis in all three cell lines as indicated by DNA- and PARP-cleavage . In addition , R- and DB00712 caused a P55008 -cell cycle block . The latter was associated with an activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , an increase of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression . Western blot analysis , as well as supershift experiments , revealed that the AP-1 activation was associated with a change of AP-1 composition toward an increase of JunB . The JNK inhibitor SP600125 antagonized R- and DB00712 -induced AP-1 DNA binding , suppression of cyclin D1 expression , and the P55008 -cell cycle block . However , JNK inhibition had no effect on flurbiprofen-induced apoptosis . Hence , the cell cycle arrest is obviously mediated , at least in part , through JNK-activation , whereas R- and DB00712 -induced apoptosis is largely independent of JNK . Although in vitro effects of R- and DB00712 were indistinguishable , only R-flurbiprofen inhibited HCT-15 tumor growth in nude mice , suggesting the involvement of additional in vivo targets , which are differently affected by R- and DB00712 .
