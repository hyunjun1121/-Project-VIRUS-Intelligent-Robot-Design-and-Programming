Association between severe toxicity of nilotinib and P22309 polymorphisms in Japanese patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia . BACKGROUND : DB04868 is a P11274 - P00519 kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . The P22309 ( P22309 ) polymorphism P22309 *28 ( *28 ) /*28 has been linked to an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with CML who receive nilotinib . Beside *28 , P22309 *6 ( *6 ) is another important variant allele in Japanese patients because it is associated with adverse events of irinotecan , metabolized by P22309 . We retrospectively investigated the association between severe toxicity of nilotinib and P22309 polymorphisms ( *6 and*28 ) in Japanese patients with CML . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Eight patients with cytogenetically confirmed CML who were receiving nilotinib were studied to explore the association of P22309 polymorphisms with severe nilotinib-related toxicity . Genotyping analyses were determined for *6 and *28 . RESULTS : All 3 patients with the *6/*6 or *6/*28 genotype had severe toxicity , including QT interval prolongation ( grade 3 ) , elevated lipase levels ( grade 3 ) plus hyperbilirubinemia ( grade 2 ) , and anemia ( grade 3 ) plus hepatic cyst hemorrhage ( grade 2 ) in 1 patient each . Among the 5 patients with the *6/*1 or *1/*1 genotype , 1 had elevated lipase levels ( grade 3 ) and another had severe pain in the lower extremities ( grade 3 ) . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that P22309 polymorphisms are important determinants of severe toxicity of nilotinib in Japanese patients .
