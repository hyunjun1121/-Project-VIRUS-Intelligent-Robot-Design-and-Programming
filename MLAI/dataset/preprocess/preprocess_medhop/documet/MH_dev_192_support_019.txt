Glutamate transporter GLT-1 mediates DB06151 inhibition of cocaine reinstatement . Both pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that DB06151 ( Q9C000 ) may be useful in treating relapse to addictive drug use . Cocaine self-administration in rats reduces both cystine-glutamate exchange and glutamate transport via GLT-1 in the nucleus accumbens , and Q9C000 treatment normalizes these two glial processes critical for maintaining glutamate homeostasis . However , it is not known if one or both of these actions by Q9C000 is needed to inhibit relapse to cocaine seeking . To determine whether the restoration of GLT-1 and/or cystine-glutamate exchange is required for Q9C000 to inhibit cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking , we utilized the rat self-administration/extinction/reinstatement model of cocaine relapse . Rats were pre-treated in the nucleus accumbens with vivo-morpholino antisense oligomers targeting either GLT-1 or Q9UPY5 ( catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger ) overlapping with daily Q9C000 administration during extinction ( 100 mg/kg , i.p. for the last 5 days ) . Rats then underwent cue-induced reinstatement of active lever pressing in the absence of Q9C000 , to determine if preventing Q9C000 -induced restoration of one or the other protein was sufficient to block the capacity of chronic Q9C000 to inhibit reinstatement . The vivo-morpholino suppression of Q9UPY5 reduced cystine-glutamate exchange but did not affect Q9C000 -induced reduction of reinstated cocaine seeking . In contrast , suppressing Q9C000 -induced restoration of GLT-1 not only prevented Q9C000 from inhibiting reinstatement , but augmented the capacity of cues to reinstate cocaine seeking . We hypothesized that the increased reinstatement after inhibiting Q9C000 induction of GLT-1 resulted from increased extracellular glutamate , and show that augmented reinstatement is prevented by blocking P41594 . Restoring GLT-1 , not cystine-glutamate exchange , is a key mechanism whereby daily Q9C000 reduces cue-induced cocaine reinstatement .
