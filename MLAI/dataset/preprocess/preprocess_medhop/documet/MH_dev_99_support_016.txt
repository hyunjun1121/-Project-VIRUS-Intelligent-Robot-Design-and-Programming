Regulation of proteolytic processing of the amyloid beta-protein precursor by first messengers . A novel potential approach for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . Amyloid deposits in Alzheimer 's disease brains consist of aggregated amyloid beta-peptides ( A beta ) which are derived by proteolytic processing of the amyloid beta-protein precursor ( P05067 ) . Proteolytic P05067 processing can be regulated by the activity of neuronal cell surface receptors including the muscarinic m1 and m3 , the serotoninergic 5-HT2 and P28335 , vasopressin and bradykinin receptor subtypes . Receptor stimulation with appropriate agonists rapidly increases the rates of release of the alpha-secretase processing product APPs which is cleaved within the A beta domain and thus is a non-amyloidogenic derivative . Moreover , stimulation of m1 receptors also decreases the formation of A beta , a secreted potentially amyloidogenic and possibly neurotoxic P05067 fragment . Similar biochemical events occur in stimulation experiments of fresh rat brain slices suggesting that neuronal activity may be involved in regulating P05067 processing in mammalian brain . Activation of non-amyloidogenic P05067 processing and inhibition of amyloidogenic processing pathways by subtype-specific agonists of muscarinic , serotoninergic or peptidergic receptors provides a novel approach for the pharmacological modulation of P05067 processing in Alzheimer 's disease .
