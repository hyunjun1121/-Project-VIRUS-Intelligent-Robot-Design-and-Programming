Divergence in signaling pathways involved in promotion of cell viability mediated by P09038 , P01138 , and P01133 in PC12 cells . We employed a series of inhibitors of intracellular cascade to disclose the precise molecular mechanisms by which basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) promotes viability of PC12 cells and compared with nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) and epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . The Q02750 and 2 inhibitors , U0126 and PD98059 , significantly suppressed cell viability mediated by P09038 in a dose-dependent manner , and to a greater extent compared with P01133 and P01138 . The degree of MEK dependency for growth factor-mediated cell viability was estimated to be in the order of P09038 , P01133 , and P01138 . DB00877 strongly inhibited the effect of P01138 on cell viability , compared with P09038 and P01133 . The mechanisms of action of P01138 -mediated cell viability may depend largely on P08133 S6 kinase-related signal transduction pathways comparing to P09038 and P01133 . The present findings suggest that different signal transduction systems may be involved in the molecular mechanisms by which P09038 , P01138 , and P01133 mediate cell viability .
