Functional and molecular characterization of ex vivo cultured epiretinal membrane cells from human proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Characterization of the cell surface marker phenotype of ex vivo cultured cells growing out of human fibrovascular epiretinal membranes ( fvERMs ) from proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) can give insight into their function in immunity , angiogenesis , and retinal detachment . FvERMs from uneventful vitrectomies due to PDR were cultured adherently ex vivo . Surface marker analysis , release of immunity- and angiogenesis-pathway-related factors upon P01375 α activation and measurement of the intracellular calcium dynamics upon mechano-stimulation using fluorescent dye Fura-2 were all performed . FvERMs formed proliferating cell monolayers when cultured ex vivo , which were negative for endothelial cell markers ( CD31 , P35968 ) , partially positive for hematopoietic- ( P28906 , Q08722 ) and mesenchymal stem cell markers ( CD73 , CD90/Thy-1 , and P09619 β ) , and negative for CD105 . CD146/ P43121 and CD166/ Q13740 , previously unreported in cells from fvERMs , were also expressed . Secretion of 11 angiogenesis-related factors ( DPPIV/ P27487 , P58294 / P30613 , ET-1 , P18065 and 3 , P10145 / P10145 , P13500 / P13500 , P14780 , PTX3/ P26022 , P05121 / P05121 , P36955 / P36955 , P01033 , and P07996 -1 ) were detected upon P01375 α activation of fvERM cells . Mechano-stimulation of these cells induced intracellular calcium propagation representing functional viability and role of these cells in tractional retinal detachment , thus serving as a model for studying tractional forces present in fvERMs in PDR ex vivo .
