Feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis in human liver : importance of HNF-4alpha for regulation of P22680 . A great number of nuclear factors are involved in the negative feedback mechanism regulating bile acid synthesis . There are two major ways for the negative feedback to effect the synthesis ; the Q15466 -dependent , involving Q96RI1 , and the Q15466 -independent way , affecting HNF-4alpha . We studied 23 patients with gallstone disease . Eight patients were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid , 7 with cholestyramine prior to operation , and 8 served as controls . Liver biopsies were analyzed with Real-time-PCR . In the cholestyramine-treated group mRNA levels of P22680 were increased about 10-fold . Treatment with DB06777 decreased the mRNA levels of P22680 by about 70 % . The mRNA levels of Q9UNU6 , Q02318 , and O75881 were not significantly altered in the treated groups . The analysis of mRNA levels for HNF-4alpha showed 64 % higher levels in the cholestyramine-treated group compared to the controls . These levels showed positive and highly significant correlation to the levels of mRNA of P22680 when studied in all three groups together . Q96RI1 , Q15466 , and O00482 / O00482 were not significantly affected by the different treatments . Our results indicate that when bile acid synthesis is upregulated by cholestyramine treatment the Q15466 -independent pathway for controlling P22680 transcription dominates over the Q15466 -dependent pathway .
