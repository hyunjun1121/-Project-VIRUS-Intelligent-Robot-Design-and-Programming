Quantitative regulation of intracellular endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( P29474 ) coupling by both tetrahydrobiopterin- P29474 stoichiometry and biopterin redox status : insights from cells with tet-regulated P30793 expression . DB00360 ( BH4 ) is a critical determinant of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity . In the absence of BH4 , P29474 becomes " uncoupled " and generates superoxide rather than NO . However , the stoichiometry of intracellular BH4/ P29474 interactions is not well defined , and it is unclear whether intracellular BH4 deficiency alone is sufficient to induce P29474 uncoupling . To address these questions , we developed novel cell lines with tet-regulated expression of human P30793 ( GTPCH ) , the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 synthesis , to selectively induce intracellular BH4 deficiency by incubation with doxycycline . These cells were stably co-transfected to express a human P29474 -green fluorescent protein fusion protein , selecting clones expressing either low ( P30793 / P29474 -LOW ) or high ( P30793 / P29474 -HIGH ) levels . DB00254 abolished GTPCH mRNA expression and GTPCH protein , leading to markedly diminished total biopterin levels and a decreased ratio of BH4 to oxidized biopterins in cells expressing P29474 . Intracellular BH4 deficiency induced superoxide generation from P29474 , as assessed by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester inhibitable 2-hydroxyethidium generation , and attenuated NO production . Quantitative analysis of cellular BH4 versus superoxide production between P30793 / P29474 -LOW and P30793 / P29474 -HIGH cells revealed a striking linear relationship between P29474 protein and cellular BH4 stoichiometry , with P29474 uncoupling at P29474 :BH4 molar ratio > 1 . Furthermore , increasing the intracellular BH2 concentration in the presence of a constant P29474 :BH4 ratio was sufficient to induce P29474 -dependent superoxide production . This specific , reductionist approach in a cell-based system reveals that P29474 :BH4 reaction stoichiometry together with the intracellular BH4:BH2 ratio , rather than absolute concentrations of BH4 , are the key determinants of P29474 uncoupling , even in the absence of exogenous oxidative stress .
