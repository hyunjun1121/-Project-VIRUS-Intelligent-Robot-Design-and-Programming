P35372 activation of P27361 /2 is P35626 and arrestin dependent in striatal neurons . In this study we investigated the mechanisms responsible for Q96HU1 kinase P27361 /2 activation following agonist activation of endogenous mu opioid receptors ( MOR ) normally expressed in cultured striatal neurons . Treatment with the MOR agonist fentanyl caused significant activation of P27361 /2 in neurons derived from wild type mice . Fentanyl effects were blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone and were not evident in neurons derived from MOR knock-out ( -/- ) mice . In contrast , P27361 /2 activation by fentanyl was not evident in neurons from P35626 -/- mice or neurons pretreated with small inhibitory RNA for arrestin3 . Consistent with this observation , treatment with the opiate morphine ( which is less able to activate arrestin ) did not elicit P27361 /2 activation in wild type neurons ; however , transfection of arrestin3-(R170E) ( a dominant positive form of arrestin that does not require receptor phosphorylation for activation ) enabled morphine activation of P27361 /2 . In addition , activation of P27361 /2 by fentanyl and morphine was rescued in P35626 -/- neurons following transfection with dominant positive arrestin3-(R170E) . The activation of P27361 /2 appeared to be selective as p38 Q96HU1 kinase activation was not increased by either fentanyl or morphine treatment in neurons from wild type , MOR-/- , or P35626 -/- mice . In addition , U0126 ( a selective inhibitor of MEK kinase responsible for P29323 phosphorylation ) blocked P27361 /2 activation by fentanyl . These results support the hypothesis that MOR activation of P27361 /2 requires opioid receptor phosphorylation by P35626 and association of arrestin3 to initiate the cascade resulting in P27361 /2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons .
