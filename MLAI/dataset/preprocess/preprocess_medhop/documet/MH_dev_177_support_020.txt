Assessment of partially deoxygenated deoxynojirimycin derivatives as glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors . Q16739 ( Q16739 ) is an approved drug target for the treatment of Gaucher disease and is considered as a valid target for combating other human pathologies , including type 2 diabetes . The clinical drug N-butyldeoxynojirimycin ( DB00419 ) is thought to inhibit through mimicry of its substrate , ceramide . In this work we demonstrate that , in contrast to what is proposed in this model , the P06681 -hydroxyl of the deoxynojirimycin core is important for Q16739 inhibition . Here we show that P13671 -OH appears of less important , which may set guidelines for the development of Q16739 inhibitors that have less affinity ( in comparison with DB00419 ) for other glycoprocessing enzymes , in particular those hydrolases that act on glucosylceramide .
