Sensitivity of a renal K+ channel ( ROMK2 ) to the inhibitory sulfonylurea compound glibenclamide is enhanced by coexpression with the DB00171 -binding cassette transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator . We demonstrate here that coexpression of ROMK2 , an inwardly rectifying DB00171 -sensitive renal K+ channel ( Q14654 ) with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( P13569 ) significantly enhances the sensitivity of ROMK2 to the sulfonylurea compound glibenclamide . When expressed alone , ROMK2 is relatively insensitive to glibenclamide . The interaction between ROMK2 , P13569 , and glibenclamide is modulated by altering the phosphorylation state of either ROMK2 , P13569 , or an associated protein , as exogenous MgATP and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of glibenclamide on ROMK2 . Thus P13569 , which has been demonstrated to interact with both Na+ and Cl- channels in airway epithelium , modulates the function of renal ROMK2 K+ channels .
