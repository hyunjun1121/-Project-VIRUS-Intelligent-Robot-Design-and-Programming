[ Natriuretic peptides as novel growth factor of growth plate cartilage ] . Recently evidence has accumulated that natriuretic peptides ( NPs ) are important regulator of endochondral ossification . Three peptides , P01160 , DB04899 and P09543 constitute the NPs family . cGMP production through two particulate guanylate cyclases is involved in their signal transduction . P01160 and DB04899 have high affinity for P16066 and P09543 for P20594 . Third receptor , called clearance receptor ( P17342 ) is involved in NPs clearance . Mice that overexpress DB04899 or P09543 and mice deficient in P17342 exhibited marked body elongation , whereas mice deficient in P09543 showed dwarfism . P09543 enhanced longitudinal growth in organ-cultured long bones , and stimulated the differentiation of osteoblast and cartilage lineage cells . Dwarfism was observed in mice deficient in Q13237 which lies downstream to cGMP . Since three genetically body-elongated mice were proven to have mutations in P17342 , it is possible that P09543 / P20594 /cGK II pathway is related to some clinical disorders . P09543 is also expected to have therapeutic application to diseases with dwarfism .
