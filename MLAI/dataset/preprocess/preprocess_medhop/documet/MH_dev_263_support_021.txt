Regional expression of prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha receptors in human myometrium , amnion , and choriodecidua with advancing gestation and labor . The change from uterine quiescence to enhanced contractile activity may be due to the differential expression of prostaglandin receptors within the myometrium and fetal membranes , in a temporal and topographically distinct manner . To address this question , we determined the localization and expression of the DB00917 receptor subtypes ( P34995 -4 ) and the PGF2alpha receptor ( P43088 ) in paired upper and lower segment myometrium , amnion , and choriodecidual samples throughout human pregnancy , with and without labor . All receptor subtypes were found throughout the muscle layers in both the upper and lower uterine segments , colocalizing with alpha smooth muscle actin . A change in intracellular localization was observed at term labor , where P34995 and P35408 were predominately associated with the nucleus . Minimal changes in the expression of the DB00917 and PGF2alpha receptor subtypes were observed with gestational age , labor , or between the upper and lower myometrial segments . Receptor expression in maternal and fetal tissues differed between the receptor subtypes ; P34995 and P35408 were predominately expressed in the fetal membranes , PTGER2 was greatest in the myometrium , whereas P43115 and P43088 were similarly expressed in the myometrium and fetal membranes . Myometrial activation through the prostaglandin receptors is perhaps more subtle and may be mediated by a balance between one or several of the prostaglandin receptor subtypes together with other known contraction associated proteins . Lack of coordination in receptor expression between the myometrium and fetal membranes may indicate different regulatory mechanisms between these tissues , or it may suggest a function for these receptors in the amnion and choriodecidua that is independent of that seen in the myometrium .
