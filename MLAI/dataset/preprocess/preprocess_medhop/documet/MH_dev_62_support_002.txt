Evaluation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of certolizumab pegol for Crohn 's disease . INTRODUCTION : P01375 -α antagonists have transformed the treatment of patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . DB08904 ( CZP ) is the third P01375 -α antagonist to be approved for use in the United States but is not currently approved in Europe . AREAS COVERED : This review evaluates the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics and efficacy of CZP in CD . Safety , immunogenicity and its use in pregnancy have also been assessed . A literature search was conducted using Pub Med ( 2004 - 2014 ) for the terms ' Crohn 's disease ' and ' certolizumab pegol ' or ' certolizumab ' or ' cimzia ' . Additional studies were identified from other sources including citation . EXPERT OPINION : As a Fab ' fragment , CZP is effective in binding P01375 -α , but does not cause Fc-mediated effects . PEGylation has improved its pharmacokinetic profile and allowed for an increased half-life of 2 weeks . Benefit for inducing response ( an improvement in symptoms ) and maintenance of remission has been shown . However , the benefit is less clear for the more stringent end-points of inducing remission and mucosal healing . There may be an advantage from the PEGylated formulation of CZP in terms of reduced injection-site reactions , reduced placental transfer in pregnancy and as a treatment option in patients who are unable to tolerate infliximab .
