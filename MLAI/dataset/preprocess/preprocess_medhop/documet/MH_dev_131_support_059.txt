Proof of concept study to assess fetal gene expression in amniotic fluid by nanoarray PCR . Microarray analysis of cell-free RNA in amniotic fluid ( AF ) supernatant has revealed differential fetal gene expression as a function of gestational age and karyotype . Once informative genes are identified , research moves to a more focused platform such as quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR . Standardized NanoArray PCR ( P60880 ) is a recently developed gene profiling technology that enables the measurement of transcripts from samples containing reduced quantities or degraded nucleic acids . We used a previously developed P60880 gene panel as proof of concept to determine whether fetal functional gene expression could be ascertained from AF supernatant . RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA from 19 AF supernatant samples of euploid fetuses between 15 to 20 weeks of gestation , and transcript abundance of 21 genes was measured . Statistically significant differences in expression , as a function of advancing gestational age , were observed for 5 of 21 genes . P08758 , P08236 , and P62937 showed decreasing gene expression over time , whereas O15234 and O43296 showed increasing gene expression over time . Statistically significantly increased expression of P42345 and P52630 was seen in female compared with male fetuses . This study demonstrates the feasibility of focused fetal gene expression analysis using P60880 technology . In the future , this technique could be optimized to examine specific genes instrumental in fetal organ system function , which could be a useful addition to prenatal care .
