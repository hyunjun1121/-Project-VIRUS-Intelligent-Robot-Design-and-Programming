Neovastat ( DB05387 ) inhibits the airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in a murine model of asthma . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma . Neovastat , having significant antitumor and antimetastatic properties , is classified as a naturally occurring multifunctional antiangiogenic agent . We evaluated the therapeutic effect of Neovastat on airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma . BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with ovalbumin ( OVA ) on days 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 and challenged with inhaled OVA on days 26 , 29 , and 31 . Neovastat was administrated by gavage ( 5 mg/kg body weight ) three times with 12 h intervals , beginning 30 min before OVA inhalation . On day 32 , mice were challenged with inhaled methacholine , and enhanced pause ( Penh ) was measured as an index of airway hyperresponsiveness . The severity of airway inflammation was determined by differential cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid . The P14780 concentration in BAL fluid samples was measured by ELISA , and P14780 activity was measured by zymography . The untreated asthma group showed an increased inflammatory cell count in BAL fluid and Penh value compared with the normal control group . Mice treated with Neovastat had significantly reduced Penh values and inflammatory cell counts in BAL fluid compared with untreated asthmatic mice . Furthermore , mice treated with Neovastat showed significantly reduced P14780 concentrations and activity in BAL fluid . These results demonstrate that Neovastat might have new therapeutic potential for airway asthmatic inflammation .
