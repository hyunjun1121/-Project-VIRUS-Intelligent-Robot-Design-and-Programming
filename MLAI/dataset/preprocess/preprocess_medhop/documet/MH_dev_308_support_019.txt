The role of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 in the development of colitis-associated cancer in mouse model . Patients with ulcerative colitis are at a very high risk of developing colorectal cancer . DB01285 -releasing hormone ( P06850 ) family peptides and their receptors ( CRHRs ) are found to modulate inflammation and tumor cell growth . However , the role of P06850 family peptides and their receptors in the inflammation-related colon cancer is still unknown . The aim of this study was to investigate the functions of P34998 signaling on the development of colitis-associated cancer ( CAC ) . Crhr1-deficient ( Crhr1(-/-) ) mice were used to explore the role of P34998 in the development of azoxymethane ( AOM ) and dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) -induced CAC . WT ( Crhr1(+/+) ) littermates were set as control . We found that the expression of P34998 and its endogenous ligands : urocortin and P06850 were enhanced in the colon of Crhr1(+/+) mice during treatment with AOM and DSS . Tumorigenesis was significantly reduced in Crhr1(-/-) mice , determined by analysis of survival rate ( increased by 20 % ) , weight loss ( decreased by 10 % ) , tumor formation ( decreased by 60 % in tumor number ) , histological scores ( decreased by 58 % ) , and cytokine production . During early CAC tumorigenesis , Crhr1(-/-) mice exhibited much less tumorigenesis , accompanied by lower inflammatory response , including decreased IL1β , P05231 and TNFα expression and macrophage infiltration and increased P22301 expression . Moreover , Crhr1(-/-) mice displayed a reduced activation of NFκB and P40763 phosphorylation with decreased proliferating and enhanced apoptotic cells in the colon . In conclusion , P34998 has a proinflammatory and therefore a protumorigenesis effect in terms of CAC , which may be helpful to develop new therapeutic approaches for inflammation and cancer prevention and treatment .
