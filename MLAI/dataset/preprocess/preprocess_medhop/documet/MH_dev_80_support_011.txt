DB06186 -induced acute severe colitis treated by infliximab . DB06186 ( anti- P16410 antibody ) is a new tool for the treatment of metastatic melanoma patients that has led to an improvement in survival rates worldwide . New types of toxicities have been described with ipilimumab called ' immune-related adverse events ' or irAEs . Here , we report an acute and steroid resistant case of ipilimumab-induced colitis treated with infliximab in a melanoma stage IV AJCC patient . The patient presented with acute grade 3 diarrhea after the second perfusion of ipilimumab . After the administration of intravenous steroids , the patient continued to have grade 2 diarrhea with erythematous mucous with several ulceration sites on rectosigmoidoscopy . DB00065 perfusion ( 5 mg/kg ) was performed and resulted in resolution of symptoms within 2 days with complete healing was observed by rectal sigmoidoscopy on day 7 . After failure of two further lines of chemotherapy , the patient died 10 months after the diagnosis of stage IVM1C melanoma . Treatment algorithms exist for the management of these digestive adverse events ; however , some points remain unclear . No predictive marker for the occurrence of this digestive toxicity has been validated to date . Modes of administration of steroids and dosage are not clearly defined , except in cases of acute abdomen ; surgery is difficult to propose for patients with a poor prognosis . DB00065 is another option for the treatment of steroid-resistant ipilimumab-induced colitis but its use in metastatic melanoma raises questions of its possible impact on the evolution of cancer . We reviewed at least 19 cases published of infliximab administration for ipilimumab-mediated colitis . Unfortunately , tolerance and cancer evolution have scarcely been reported . Thus , because more patients are being treated with P16410 blockade , management of ipilimumab-induced colitis requires further studies .
