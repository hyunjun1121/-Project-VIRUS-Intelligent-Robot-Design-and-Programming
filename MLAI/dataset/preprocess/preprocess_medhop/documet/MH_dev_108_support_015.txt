A latent variable approach for modeling categorical endpoints among patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with DB06674 plus methotrexate . The need for accurate exposure-response modeling is critical in the drug development process . Few methods are available for linking discrete endpoints , especially ordered categorical variables , to mechanistic ( e.g. , indirect response ) models . Here we describe a latent-variable approach that is proposed in conjunction with an inhibitory indirect response model to link the placebo/comedication effect and drug exposure to the endpoints . The model is parsimonious , with desirable characteristics at initial timepoints , and allows simultaneous modeling of multiple endpoints that are categorically ordered . Application of the model is demonstrated with data from a phase 3 clinical trial of DB06674 , a human IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . The efficacy endpoints were 20 , 50 , and 70 % improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria ( ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70 , respectively ) as measures of improvement in disease severity . The modeling results were shown to be consistent by using either a sequential or simultaneous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approach . The suitability of likelihood profiling and proper use of bootstrap methods in assessing parameter estimation precision are also presented . More accurate , parsimonious models with appropriately quantified uncertainty can facilitate better drug development decisions .
