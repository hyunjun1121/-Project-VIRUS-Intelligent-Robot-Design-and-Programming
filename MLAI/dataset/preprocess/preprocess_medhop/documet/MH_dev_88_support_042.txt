DB00082 : a growth hormone receptor antagonist for the treatment of acromegaly . P10912 ( P10912 ) dimerization is a prerequisite to the generation of growth hormone ( GH ) action . DB00082 is a P10912 antagonist that has been designed to bind to the P10912 at the cell surface and hence block this process . Initial studies suggest that pegvisomant is a highly effective antagonist of GH action in patients with acromegaly . The blockade of GH action , rather than the inhibition of pituitary GH secretion , represents a novel concept in the medical management of acromegaly . In this review , the design , efficacy , challenges and future role of pegvisomant are discussed .
