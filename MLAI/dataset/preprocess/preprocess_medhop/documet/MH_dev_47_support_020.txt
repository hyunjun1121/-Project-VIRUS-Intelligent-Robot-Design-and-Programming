Constitutive NF-kappaB activation confers interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) independence and resistance to dexamethasone and Janus kinase inhibitor DB08877 in murine plasmacytoma cells . Myeloma cells are dependent on P05231 for their survival and proliferation during the early stages of disease , and independence from P05231 is associated with disease progression . The role of the NF-κB pathway in the P05231 -independent growth of myeloma cells has not been studied . Because human herpesvirus 8-encoded P13646 selectively activates the NF-κB pathway , we have used it as a molecular tool to examine the ability of the NF-κB pathway to confer P05231 independence on murine plasmacytomas . We demonstrated that ectopic expression of P13646 , but not its NF-κB-defective mutant or a structural homolog , protected plasmacytomas against P05231 withdrawal-induced apoptosis and resulted in emergence of P05231 -independent clones that could proliferate long-term in vitro in the absence of P05231 and form abdominal plasmacytomas with visceral involvement when injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice . These P05231 -independent clones were dependent on NF-κB activity for their survival and proliferation but were resistant to dexamethasone and DB08877 , a selective P23458 /2 inhibitor . Ectopic expression of human T cell leukemia virus 1-encoded Tax protein , which resembles P13646 in inducing constitutive NF-κB activation , similarly protected plasmacytoma cells against P05231 withdrawal-induced apoptosis . Although P13646 is known to up-regulate P05231 gene expression , its protective effect was not due to induction of endogenous P05231 production but instead was associated with sustained expression of several antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family upon P05231 withdrawal . Collectively , these results demonstrate that NF-κB activation can not only promote the emergence of P05231 independence during myeloma progression but can also confer resistance to dexamethasone and DB08877 .
