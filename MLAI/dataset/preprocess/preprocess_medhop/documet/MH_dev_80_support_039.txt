Novel anti-melanoma immunotherapies : disarming tumor escape mechanisms . The immune system fights cancer and sometimes temporarily eliminates it or reaches an equilibrium stage of tumor growth . However , continuous immunological pressure also selects poorly immunogenic tumor variants that eventually escape the immune control system . Here , we focus on metastatic melanoma , a highly immunogenic tumor , and on anti-melanoma immunotherapies , which recently , especially following the FDA approval of DB06186 , gained interest from drug development companies . We describe new immunomodulatory approaches currently in the development pipeline , focus on the novel P13688 immune checkpoint , and compare its potential to the extensively described targets , P16410 and PD1 . This paper combines multi-disciplinary approaches and describes anti-melanoma immunotherapies from molecular , medical , and business angles .
