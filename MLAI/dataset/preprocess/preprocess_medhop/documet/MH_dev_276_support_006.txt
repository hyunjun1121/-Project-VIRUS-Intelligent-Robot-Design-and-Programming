Regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 4/fasting-induced adipose factor ( Angptl4/FIAF ) expression in mouse white adipose tissue and 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Q9BY76 ( Angptl4 ) /FIAF ( fasting-induced adipose factor ) was first identified as a target for Q07869 and to be strongly induced in white adipose tissue ( WAT ) by fasting . Here we have examined the regulation of the expression and release of this adipokine in mouse WAT and in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Angptl4/FIAF expression was measured by RT-PCR and real-time PCR ; plasma Angptl4/FIAF and release of the protein in cell culture was determined by western blotting . The Angptl4/FIAF gene was expressed in each of the major WAT depots of mice , the mRNA level in WAT being similar to the liver and much higher ( > 50-fold ) than skeletal muscle . Fasting mice ( 18 h ) resulted in a substantial increase in Angptl4/FIAF mRNA in liver and muscle ( 9.5- and 21-fold , respectively ) ; however , there was no effect of fasting on Angptl4/FIAF mRNA in WAT and the plasma level of Angptl4/FIAF was unchanged . The Angptl4/FIAF gene was expressed in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes before and after differentiation , the level increasing post-differentiation ; Angptl4/FIAF was released into the culture medium . P01308 , leptin , dexamethasone , noradrenaline , TNFalpha and several IL ( IL-1beta , P05231 , P22301 , Q14116 ) had little effect on Angptl4/FIAF mRNA levels in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . However , a major stimulation of Angptl4/FIAF expression was observed with rosiglitazone and the inflammatory prostaglandins PGD2 and PGJ2 . Angptl4/FIAF does not act as an adipose tissue signal of nutritional status , but is markedly induced by fasting in liver and skeletal muscle .
