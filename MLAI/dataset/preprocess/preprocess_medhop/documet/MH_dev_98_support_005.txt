[ Low doses of sulphonyluria as a successful replacement for insulin therapy in a patient with neonatal diabetes due to a mutation of Q14654 gene encoding Kir6.2 ] . Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare metabolic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:300.000 to 400.000 newborns , and less than 50 % of the neonates have permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( PNDM ) . Recently , activating mutation in the Q14654 gene encoding Kir6.2 subunit of the adenosin triphosphate-sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channel has been described as the most frequent cause of PNDM . Under physiological circumstances K( DB00171 ) channel closure plays a central role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells . Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion by binding to and closing K( DB00171 ) channels and thus bypassing beta cell metabolism stimulate the same chain of reactions as glucose . We describe a boy diagnosed with PNDM at the age of 3 months when insulin therapy was started , and at the age of 4.5 years Q14654 gene was sequenced and found that the boy carried a de novo activating R201H mutation . P01308 therapy was successfully switched to low doses of oral glibenclamide . Accordingly , it is important to emphasize that every person diagnosed with diabetes before six months of life , however old they actually are , should be tested for K( DB00171 ) mutations which is offered via the website www.diabetesgenes.org .
