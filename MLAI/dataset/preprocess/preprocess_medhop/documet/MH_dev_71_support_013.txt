Distinct mechanistic activity profile of pralatrexate in comparison to other antifolates in in vitro and in vivo models of human cancers . PURPOSE : This study evaluated mechanistic differences of pralatrexate , methotrexate , and pemetrexed . METHODS : Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) was quantified using recombinant human P00374 . Cellular uptake and folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) activity were determined using radiolabeled pralatrexate , methotrexate , and pemetrexed in NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . The tumor growth inhibition ( TGI ) was assessed using MV522 and NCI-H460 human NSCLC xenografts . RESULTS : Apparent K ( i ) values for P00374 inhibition were 45 , 26 , and > 200 nM for pralatrexate , methotrexate , and pemetrexed , respectively . A significantly greater percentage of radiolabeled pralatrexate entered the cells and was polyglutamylatated relative to methotrexate or pemetrexed . In vivo , pralatrexate showed superior anti-tumor activity in both NSCLC models , with more effective dose-dependent TGI in the more rapidly growing NCI-H460 xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : DB06813 demonstrated a distinct mechanistic and anti-tumor activity profile relative to methotrexate and pemetrexed . DB06813 exhibited enhanced cellular uptake and increased polyglutamylation , which correlated with increased TGI in NSCLC xenograft models .
