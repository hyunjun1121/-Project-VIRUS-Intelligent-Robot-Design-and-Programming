Involvement of retinoic acid receptor alpha in the stimulation of tissue-type plasminogen-activator gene expression in human endothelial cells . Retinoids stimulate tissue-type plasminogen-activator ( t-PA ) gene expression in human endothelial cells , and are likely to do so by binding to one or more nuclear retinoid receptors . The present study was initiated to identify the retinoid receptor(s) involved in this process . Expression and regulation of retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) were analyzed by Northern-blot analysis of total or poly(A)-rich RNA prepared from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . Prior to any exposure to retinoids , HUVEC express two transcripts for P10276 ( 3.6 kb and 2.8 kb ) , and low levels of transcripts for P10826 ( 3.4 kb and 3.2 kb ) and P13631 ( 3.3 kb and 3.1 kb ) . Two RXR subtypes were identified , RXR-alpha ( 4.8 kb ) and , at a much lower concentration , RXR-beta ( 2.4 kb ) ; no evidence for the presence of RXR-gamma was found . Furthermore , HUVEC express cellular retinol-binding protein I ( P09455 ) and cellular retinoic-acid-binding protein I ( P29762 ) mRNA . Exposure of HUVEC to 1 microM retinoic acid or the DB04942 , Ch55 , led to the induction of the two P10826 mRNAs , RXR-alpha mRNA and P09455 mRNA , whereas the expression of the other receptor and P29762 transcripts did not change appreciably . Using retinoid analogues that bind preferentially to one of the RAR or RXR subtypes , we found evidence that P10276 is involved in the retinoid-induced t-PA expression in HUVEC . This conclusion was strengthened by experiments in which blocking of P10276 with a specific P10276 antagonist , Ro 41-5253 , was demonstrated to suppress the induction of t-PA by retinoids .
