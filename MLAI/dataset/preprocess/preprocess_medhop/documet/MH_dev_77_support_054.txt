First report of warfarin dose requirements in patients possessing the P11712 *12 allele . BACKGROUND : DB00682 is the most frequently prescribed anticoagulant in North America and Europe . It is administered as a racemate , but S-warfarin is principally responsible for its anticoagulant activity . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C9 is the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of S-warfarin . Numerous variant alleles of P11712 have been identified . The P11712 *12 ( rs9332239 ) allele harbors a P489S substitution in P11712 which has been shown to result in a 40 % decline in catalytic activity in vitro . CASES : Four Caucasian patients with a low mean weekly warfarin dose ( MWWD ) were genotyped for P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P02649 variant alleles . None of the four patients carried the common P11712 variant alleles ( *2 , *3 , *5 , *6 , *7 , *8 , *9 , *11 , *13 ) despite a relatively low MWWD ( 23.4±7.94 mg ) compared to 208 patients carrying the CYP29C9*1 genotype ( 32.2±12.65 mg ) . Given that P11712 *12 confers decreased in vitro activity to the enzyme , we investigated whether these patients carried this allele . All four patients were P11712 *12 CT heterozygotes . Individual comparisons with patients possessing the same Q9BQB6 and P02649 genotypes also demonstrated lower dose requirements in the patients that possessed P11712 *12 allele . CONCLUSIONS : There are no reports of the clinical impact of rs9332239 on P11712 substrates . This is the first report of patients with the rare P11712 *12 genotype and lower warfarin dose requirements .
