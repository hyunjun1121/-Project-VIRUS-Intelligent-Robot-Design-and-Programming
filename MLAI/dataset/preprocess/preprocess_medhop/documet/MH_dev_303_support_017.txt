P30532 gene D398N polymorphism in Japanese lung adenocarcinoma . BACKGROUND : Recently , to identify genetic factors that modify lung cancer risk , P30532 non-synonymous variant amino acid position 398 ( D398N ) was identified . The site was a highly conserved in the second cellular loop of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit protein . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We have investigated P30532 gene polymorphism status in 302 surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma cases from Nagoya City University Hospital . The presence or absence of P30532 polymorphism was analyzed by direct sequences . P00533 mutations status was already investigated and reported . RESULTS : We detected nine cases ( 2.98 % ) of P30532 polymorphism ( D398N ) in our cohort . Total P00533 mutations were present in 129 patients ( 42.7 % ) . The polymorphism statuses were not correlated with gender ( women ; 2.1 % versus men ; 3.7 % , P = 0.5119 ) , smoking status ( never smoker ; 2.0 % versus smoker ; 4.0 % , P = 0.3339 ) , pathological stages ( stage I ; 2.6 % versus stage II-IV ; 3.8 % , P = 0.7246 ) , and P00533 mutation status of the lung adenocarcinomas ( mutation ; 2.3 % versus wild type ; 3.7 % , P = 0.7373 ) . In this analysis , P30532 polymorphism ( D398N ) patients had significantly worse prognosis ( 5/9 were dead ; mean survival = 27.1 mo ) than the patients with P30532 wild type ( 74/293 were dead ; mean survival = 113.9 mo ) ( log-rank test ; P = 0.0146 ) . CONCLUSION : Although P30532 polymorphism is rare from Japanese lung cancer , polymorphism status might be correlated with shorter survival .
