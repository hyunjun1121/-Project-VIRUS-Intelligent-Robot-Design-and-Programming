DB06698 treatment in managing vertigo and improving vestibular compensation : clarification . DB06698 dihydrochloride ( betahistine ) is currently used in the management of vertigo and vestibular pathologies with different aetiologies . The main goal of this review is to clarify the mechanisms of action of this drug , responsible for the symptomatic relief of vertigo and the improvement of vestibular compensation . The review starts with a brief summary recalling the role of histamine as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter in the control of the vestibular functions , and the role of the histaminergic system in vestibular compensation . Then are presented data recorded in animal models demonstrating that betahistine efficacy can be explained by mechanisms targeting the histamine receptors ( HRs ) at three different levels : the vascular tree , with an increase of cochlear and vestibular blood flow involving the P35367 ; the central nervous system , with an increase of histamine turnover implicating the Q9Y5N1 , and the peripheral labyrinth , with a decrease of vestibular input implying the Q9Y5N1 / Q9H3N8 . Clinical data from vestibular loss patients show the impact of betahistine treatment for the long-term control of vertigo , improvement of balance and quality of life that can be explained by these mechanisms of action . However , two conditions , at least , are required for reaching the betahistine therapeutic effect : the dose and the duration of treatment . Experimental and clinical data supporting these requirements are exposed in the last part of this review .
