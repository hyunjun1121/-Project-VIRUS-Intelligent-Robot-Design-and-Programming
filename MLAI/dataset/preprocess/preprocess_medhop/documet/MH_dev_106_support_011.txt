Some studies on spontaneous Hymenolepis diminuta infection in laboratory rats . Hymenolepis diminuta is a tapeworm that occurs worldwide . It is known to be found commonly in areas where large amounts of food grains or other dry feed products , which are the favorite foods for rats . Transmission of disease to human is uncommon ; however , it may be a serious threat for population who are living in rural areas which are suffering from excessive rodents . Here , this study had done on spontaneous H. diminuta infection in laboratory rats as a model . Out of thirty five adult laboratory rats investigated for parasitic diseases only nine ( 25.71 % ) were diagnosed positive for spontaneous H. diminuta infection . Four of them ( 44.44 % ) were found losing of weight and lacking of motility , while the others were normal . On microscopic examination , H. diminuta eggs had been found in their stool . On autopsy , small intestines were found to contain from 5-6 multi-segmented tapeworms in each rat . Histopathologically , intestinal lumen showed varying sections of H. diminuta segments with serrated borders . H. diminuta infection caused multiple mucosal ulcers with absence of intestinal villi from the surface epithelium and excessive mucin . Moreover , inflammatory cells infiltration in the connective tissue core of the villi . Furthermore , the Toluidine blue stain showed that there are Mastiocytosis . Additionally , there were goblet cells hyperplasia on using DB00233 . Moreover , there were high expression of cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) and inducible Nitric-Oxide Synthase ( iNOs ) . This implicate , strong correlation between P35354 , P01375 -α and iNOs expression and inflammation induced by H. diminuta .
