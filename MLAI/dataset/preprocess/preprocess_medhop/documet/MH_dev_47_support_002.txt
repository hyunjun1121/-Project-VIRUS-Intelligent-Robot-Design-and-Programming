beta-Carotene induces apoptosis and up-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression and reactive oxygen species production in MCF-7 cancer cells . Although the pharmacological role of beta-carotene in the prevention and treatment of many cancer cells has received increasing attention , the molecular mechanisms underlying such chemopreventive activity are not clear . Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( P37231 ) has been implicated in regulating breast cancer cell differentiation and apoptosis , the effects of beta-carotene on the P37231 -mediated pathway and its association with reactive oxygen species production in MCF-7 cells were investigated in the present study . The results demonstrated that beta-carotene significantly increased P37231 mRNA and protein levels in time-dependent manner . In addition , beta-carotene increased the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) expression and decreased the prostanoid synthesis rate-limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 expression . DB07863 ( GW9662 ) , an irreversible P37231 antagonist , partly attenuated the cell death caused by beta-carotene . Further , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production was induced by beta-carotene , resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome C release . DB00143 ( DB00143 ) treatment decreases the intracellular ROS and prevents cytochrome C release and cell apoptosis induced by beta-carotene . In total , these observations suggest that the synergistic effect of P37231 expression and ROS production may account for beta-carotene-mediated anticancer activities .
