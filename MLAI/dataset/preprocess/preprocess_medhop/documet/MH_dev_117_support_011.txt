Exome-level comparison of primary well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and their cell lines . Neuroendocrine cancer cell lines are used to investigate therapeutic targets in neuroendocrine tumors ( NET ) and have been instrumental in the design of clinical trials targeting the PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathways , P15692 inhibitors , and somatostatin analogues . It remains unknown , however , whether the genomic makeup of NET cell lines reflect that of primary NET since comprehensive unbiased genome sequencing has not been performed on the cell lines . Four bronchopulmonary NET ( BP-NET ) -NCI-H720 , NCI-H727 , NCI-H835 , and UMC11-and two pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( panNET ) -BON-1 and QGP1-were cultured . DNA was isolated , and exome sequencing was done . GATK and EXCAVATOR were used for bioinformatic analysis . We detected a total of 1,764 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants at a rate of 8 per Mb in BP-NET and 4.3 per Mb in panNET cell lines , including 52 mutated COSMIC cancer genes in these cell lines , such as P04637 , P38398 , P06400 , P49815 , P46531 , Q09472 , GNAS , P35968 , Q15831 , and P25054 but not P46100 , Q9UER7 , nor O00255 . Our data suggest that mutation rate , the pattern of copy number variations , and the mutational spectra in the BP-NET cell lines are more similar to the changes observed in small cell lung cancer than those found in primary BP-NET . Likewise , mutation rate and pattern including the absence of mutations in P46100 / Q9UER7 , O00255 , and P25490 in the panNET cell lines BON1 and QGP1 suggest that these cell lines do not have the genetic signatures of a primary panNET . These results suggest that results from experiments with BP-NET and panNET cell lines need to be interpreted with caution .
