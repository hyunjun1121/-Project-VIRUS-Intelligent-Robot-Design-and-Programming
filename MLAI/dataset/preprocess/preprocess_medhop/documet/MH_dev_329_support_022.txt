O15520 and Q9NSA1 as regulators in adipocyte development and metabolism . The FGF family comprises twenty-two evolutionarily related members with diverse functions in development , metabolism , and neuronal activities . O15520 and Q9NSA1 play unique roles in adipocyte development and metabolism , respectively . O15520 mediates biological responses by activating FGF receptor 2b ( FGFR2b ) with heparin/heparan sulfate in a paracrine manner . In contrast , Q9NSA1 mediates biological responses by activating FGFRs with β Q9UEF7 in cultured cells . However , Q9NSA1 acts in an autocrine manner via a β Q9UEF7 -independent signaling pathway in mice . Fgf10 knockout mice die shortly after birth . Preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis are greatly impaired in Fgf10 knockout mouse embryos . O15520 stimulates preadipocyte proliferation through the Ras/MAPK pathway followed by the cyclin D2-dependent phosphorylation of Q08999 . O15520 also stimulates adipogenesis by inducing the expression of P06400 through the Ras/MAPK pathway . P06400 binds C/EBPα . The P06400 -C/EBPα complex induces adipogenesis . Fgf21 is abundantly expressed in the liver . Hepatic Fgf21 expression is markedly induced in mice by fasting . Q9NSA1 exerts pharmacological effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and adipocytes . However , the phenotypes of Fgf21 knockout mice , which are apparently normal and fertile , indicate Q9NSA1 not to be a physiological regulator for hepatic functions . Hepatic Q9NSA1 inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes , and so is a negative regulator of lipolysis during fasting . Q9NSA1 may be a " thrifty factor " . Serum Q9NSA1 levels are increased in patients with metabolic diseases related with obesity , indicating potential roles of Q9NSA1 in adipocyte metabolism .
