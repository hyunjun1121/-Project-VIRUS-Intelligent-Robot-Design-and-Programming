Emerging therapeutic targets in bladder cancer . Treatment of muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma ( BCa ) remains a major challenge . Comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors and identification of driver mutations may reveal new therapeutic targets . This manuscript discusses relevant molecular drivers of the malignant phenotype and agents with therapeutic potential in BCa . Small molecule pan-FGFR inhibitors have shown encouraging efficacy and safety results especially among patients with activating FGFR mutations or translocations . P42345 inhibitors for patients with Q92574 mutations and concomitant targeting of PI3K and MEK represent strategies to block PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathway . Encouraging preclinical results with ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) exemplifies a new potential treatment for P04626 -positive BCa along with innovative bispecific antibodies . Inhibitors of cell cycle regulators ( aurora kinase , polo-like kinase 1 , and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ) are being investigated in combination with chemotherapy . Early results of clinical studies with anti- P16410 and anti- Q9NZQ7 are propelling immune modulating drugs to the forefront of emerging treatments for BCa . Collectively , these novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies hold promise to improve the outcome of patients afflicted with this malignancy .
