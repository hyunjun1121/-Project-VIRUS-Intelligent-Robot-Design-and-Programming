An in vitro model of human acute ethanol exposure that incorporates P49682 - and P61073 -dependent recruitment of immune cells . Alcoholic liver disease ( P33897 ) is one of the commonest causes of cirrhosis and liver failure in the developed world . Hepatic inflammation is the critical stage in progression of both P33897 and non- P33897 , but it remains difficult to study the underlying mechanisms in a human system , and current animal models do not fully recapitulate human liver disease . We developed a human tissue-based system to study lymphocyte recruitment in response to ethanol challenge . Precision-cut liver slices ( PCLS ) from human livers were incubated in culture , and hepatic function was determined by albumin production , 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay , glucose uptake responses , and morphometric assessment . Responses of tissue and lymphocytes to ethanol exposure were determined by PCR , flow cytometry , histology , and lymphocyte infiltration assays . Human PCLS demonstrated appropriate upregulation of P05181 , ADH1Î± , and P00326 in response to ethanol treatment . DB00898 also induced expression of endothelial P19320 and P05362 , production of sICAM-1 and P10145 , and the chemokine receptors P49682 and P61073 on P01730 and CD8 lymphocytes . P49682 - and P61073 -dependent migration of lymphocytes into the tissue increased significantly in response to treatment with ethanol . We have demonstrated that ethanol increases chemokine receptor expression and lymphocyte recruitment into human liver tissue , suggesting that it may operate directly to promote hepatitis in P33897 . The physiological and pathophysiological responses of the PCLS to ethanol in vitro highlight the potential of this assay for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying human liver inflammation and as a screening tool for novel therapeutics .
