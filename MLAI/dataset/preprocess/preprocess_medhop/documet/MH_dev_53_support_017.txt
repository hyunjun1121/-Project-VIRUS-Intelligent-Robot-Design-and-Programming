P35557 contributes to glucose phosphorylation in D-lactic acid production by Sporolactobacillus inulinus P28062 -8 . Sporolactobacillus inulinus , a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium , is a species capable of efficient industrial D-lactic acid production from glucose . DB09341 phosphorylation is the key step of glucose metabolism , and fine-tuned expression of which can improve D-lactic acid production . During growth on high-concentration glucose , a fast induction of high glucokinase ( Q8IVH8 ) activity was observed , and paralleled the patterns of glucose consumption and D-lactic acid accumulation , while phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system ( Q03393 ) activity was completely repressed . The transmembrane proton gradient of 1.3-1.5 units was expected to generate a large proton motive force to the uptake of glucose . This suggests that the Q8IVH8 pathway is the major route for glucose utilization , with the uptake of glucose through Q03393 -independent transport systems and phosphorylation of glucose by Q8IVH8 in S. inulinus D-lactic acid production . The gene encoding Q8IVH8 was cloned from S. inulinus and expressed in Escherichia coli . The amino acid sequence revealed significant similarity to Q8IVH8 sequences from Bacillaceae . The recombinant Q8IVH8 was purified and shown to be a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 34.5 kDa . Strikingly , it demonstrated an unusual broad substrate specificity , catalyzing phosphorylation of DB08831 , mannitol , maltose , galactose and glucosamine , in addition to glucose . This report documented the key step concerning glucose phosphorylation of S. inulinus , which will help to understand the regulation of glucose metabolism and D-lactic acid production .
