A population-based association study of candidate genes for depression and sleep disturbance . The clinical manifestation of depression comprises a variety of symptoms , including early morning awakenings and fatigue , features also indicating disturbed sleep . The presence or absence of these symptoms may reflect differences in neurobiological processes leading to prolonged depression . Several neurobiological mechanisms have been indicated in the induction of depression , including disturbances in serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission and in the action of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis . The same transmitters have also been linked to sleep regulation . We hypothesized that depression without simultaneous symptoms of disturbed sleep would partly have a different genetic background than depression with symptoms of disturbed sleep . We tested this hypothesis using a systematic population-based association study of 14 candidate genes related to depression and disturbed sleep . Association of genetic variants with either depression alone , depression with early morning awakenings , or depression with fatigue was investigated using permutation-based allelic association analysis of a sample of 1,654 adults recruited from Finland 's population-based program . The major findings were associations of Q8IWU9 ( rs12229394 ) with depression accompanied by fatigue in women and P16220 ( rs11904814 ) with depression alone in men . We also found suggestive associations in women for Q99259 , P42263 , and P23560 with depression accompanied by fatigue , and for P34998 with depression accompanied by early morning awakenings . The results indicate sex-dependent and symptom-specific differences in the genetic background of depression . These differences may partially explain the broad spectrum of depressive symptoms , and their systematic monitoring could potentially be used for diagnostic purposes .
