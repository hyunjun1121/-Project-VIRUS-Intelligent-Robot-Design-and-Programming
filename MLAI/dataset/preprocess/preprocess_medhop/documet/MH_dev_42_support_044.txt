[ New therapies targeting the genetic mutations responsible for different types of melanoma ] . A number of molecular alterations have been described for melanoma . Melanomas with P15056 mutations tend to be located in areas of intermittent sun exposure , whereas melanomas with P10721 mutations mostly appear in acral areas , the mucosas , and areas of chronic sun exposure . DB00398 , a P15056 inhibitor , has a cytostatic effect on most melanomas with mutations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , and is also capable of triggering apoptosis in a small subgroup of these melanomas . By inhibiting P10721 , imatinib has a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on melanomas with P10721 mutations , and probably has the same effect on another subgroup of melanomas with other as yet imperfectly understood P10721 mutations . For therapy to be effective , agents should be selected according to the pathways associated with the genetic mutations present in the melanoma .
