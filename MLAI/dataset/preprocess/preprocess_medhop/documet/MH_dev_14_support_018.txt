Altered expression of beta-catenin , P12830 , cycloxygenase-2 , and p53 protein by ovine intestinal adenocarcinoma cells . Around 1.6 % of sheep in New Zealand develop small-intestinal adenocarcinomas . These neoplasms typically develop widespread metastases . The common development of these neoplasms and their subsequent behavior suggests that sheep could be a useful animal model of human colonic cancer . However , for an animal model of human disease to be relevant , similar genetic mutations should be present . Genetic mutations within human colonic cancers frequently result in expression of cycloxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , loss of membranous expression of beta-catenin and P12830 , and accumulation of p53 protein within the neoplastic cells . Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the presence of these 4 proteins within 26 ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas . Loss of membranous beta-catenin reactivity was observed in 14 of 26 ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas ( 54 % ) . The loss of membranous beta-catenin reactivity was accompanied by cytoplasmic and nuclear reactivity in 2 neoplasms . Loss of P12830 was observed within 8 of 26 neoplasms ( 31 % ) . Neoplastic cell expression of P35354 was observed in 12 of 26 neoplasms ( 46 % ) , whereas cells within 3 of 26 neoplasms ( 11 % ) contained visible p53 protein . In conclusion , all 4 proteins that commonly have altered expression in human colonic cancers were also altered in a proportion of the ovine intestinal adenocarcinomas . These results provide additional evidence that sheep could be useful for the study of human colonic cancer .
