Structural and functional similarities between osmotin from Nicotiana tabacum seeds and human adiponectin . Osmotin , a plant protein , specifically binds a seven transmembrane domain receptor-like protein to exert its biological activity via a RAS2/ DB02527 signaling pathway . The receptor protein is encoded in the gene ORE20/PHO36 and the mammalian homolog of PHO36 is a receptor for the human hormone adiponectin ( Q96A54 ) . Moreover it is known that the osmotin domain I can be overlapped to the Î²-barrel domain of adiponectin . Therefore , these observations and some already existing structural and biological data open a window on a possible use of the osmotin or of its derivative as adiponectin agonist . We have modelled the three-dimensional structure of the adiponectin trimer ( Q15848 ) , and two Q96A54 and PHO36 receptors . Moreover , we have also modelled the following complexes : Q15848 / Q96A54 , osmotin/PHO36 and osmotin/ Q96A54 . We have then shown the structural determinants of these interactions and their physico-chemical features and analyzed the related interaction residues involved in the formation of the complexes . The stability of the modelled structures and their complexes was always evaluated and controlled by molecular dynamics . On the basis of these results a 9 residues osmotin peptide was selected and its interaction with Q96A54 and PHO36 was modelled and analysed in term of energetic stability by molecular dynamics . To confirm in vivo the molecular modelling data , osmotin has been purified from nicotiana tabacum seeds and its nine residues peptide synthesized . We have used cultured human synovial fibroblasts that respond to adiponectin by increasing the expression of P05231 , P01375 and IL-1beta via Q96A54 . The biological effect on fibroblasts of osmotin and its peptide derivative has been found similar to that of adiponectin confirming the results found in silico .
