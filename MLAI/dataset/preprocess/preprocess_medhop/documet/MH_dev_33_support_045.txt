Advances in immunotherapy of chronic myeloid leukemia CML . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce sustained disease remissions in chronic myeloid leukemia by exploiting the addiction of this type of leukemia to the activity of the fusion oncogene P11274 - P00519 . However , these agents fail to eradicate CML stem cells which are ultimately responsible for disease relapses upon treatment discontinuation . Evidence that the immune system can effectively reject CML stem cells potentially leading to patient cure is provided by the experience with patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantations . Compelling evidence indicates that more modern , antigen-specific immunotherapeutic approaches are also feasible and hold strong potential to be clinically effective . Amongst these , particularly promising is the use of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with antigens or direct application of in vitro transcribed RNA encoding for leukemia-associated antigens , since this approach allows to circumvent HLA-restriction of the leukemia-associated T cell epitopes that have been eventually identified . Combining these strategies with monoclonal antibodies , such as anti- P16410 or anti- P18621 , may help to obtain even stronger immune responses and better clinical results . This narrative review addresses this topic by focusing in particular on the cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies for CML and on the issue of the leukemia-associated antigens to be selected for targeting .
