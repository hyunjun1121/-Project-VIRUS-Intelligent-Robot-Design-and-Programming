Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathway enhances temozolomide-induced cytotoxicity in pituitary adenoma cell lines in vitro and xenografted pituitary adenoma in female nude mice . Invasive pituitary adenomas ( PAs ) are often refractory to standard therapy and salvage treatment with temozolomide ( DB00853 ) . Hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway contributes to chemotherapy resistance in many cancers . DB05241 , a novel dual-PI3K/ P42345 inhibitor , has recently shown its efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with conventional therapeutics in many cancers . The hyperactive PI3K/AKT/ P42345 pathway frequently occurs in invasive PAs . In this study , we investigated whether DB05241 sensitizes PA cells to DB00853 in vitro and in vivo . Experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of DB05241 and DB00853 alone or in combination on cell proliferation and apoptosis of PA cell lines ( Î± DB00279 -1 , GH3 , and MMQ ) in vitro as well as the tumor growth and serum GH and prolactin secretions in a GH3 xenograft tumor model of female nude mice . DB05241 and DB00853 synergistically inhibited the growth of PA cell lines and induced apoptosis . Combination of DB05241 and DB00853 synergistically inhibited tumor growth , decreased serum GH and prolactin levels , and reduced the sacrifice rate of GH3 xenograft tumor models without increased systemic side effects . In addition , DB05241 in combination with DB00853 dramatically decreased phosphorylation of AKT and P42345 as well as the expression of Bcl-2 . The increased expression of cleaved poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase and Bcl-2-associated X protein along with elevated caspase-3/7 activity were also observed in the combination group . Therefore , dual inhibitors of PI3K and P42345 may enhance alkylating agent-mediated cytotoxicity and provide a novel regimen in the treatment of invasive PAs .
