Renal cell carcinoma and the use of sorafenib . Immunotherapy results in a small overall survival advantage in metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , but there is a need to develop more effective systemic therapies . Angiogenesis has an important role in the pathophysiology of RCC and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is a key mediator of this process . DB00398 ( BAY 43-9006 ) is a new agent belonging to a class of drugs called kinase inhibitors and inhibits the P15692 , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , and c- P10721 receptor tyrosine kinases , amongst others . DB00398 has shown significant activity with manageable toxicity in metastatic RCC in phase 2 studies in patients pretreated with immunotherapy , whilst prolonged progression-free survival in comparison with placebo in a phase 3 study has been reported . Further phase 3 trials in advanced disease are ongoing and a trial of adjuvant sorafenib therapy in RCC is planned .
