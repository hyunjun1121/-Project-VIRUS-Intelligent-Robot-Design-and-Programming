Quantitative trait locus mapping of susceptibilities to butylated hydroxytoluene-induced lung tumor promotion and pulmonary inflammation in CXB mice . We have reported previously [ Bauer,A.K. et al. ( 2001 ) Exp. Lung Res. , 27 , 197-216 ] that the 13 CXB recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J progenitors vary in their responsiveness to both lung tumor promotion and pulmonary inflammation induced by chronic administration of butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ) . Herein we have applied these data , along with markers known to be polymorphic among these strains , to conduct linkage analysis of these susceptibilities . This enabled us to assign provisional quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) that govern these strain variations in susceptibility as a genetic approach to assessing the influence of inflammation on tumorigenesis . A Chr 15 ( Q04695 -55.6 cM ) QTL regulated susceptibility to two-stage carcinogenesis , a protocol in which chronic BHT exposure followed a single urethane injection ; a similar QTL on Chr 15 ( 46.7-61.7 cM ) influenced BHT induction of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression . A Chr 18 ( 37-41 cM ) QTL modulated both the number of lung tumors induced by 3-methylcholanthrene ( MCA ) injection with subsequent treatment with BHT as well as BHT-induced ingress of macrophages into airways . Other chromosomal sites that affected either the degree of BHT-elicited macrophage infiltration , Chr 9 ( 48-61 cM ) , or P35354 induction , Chr 10 ( 59-65 cM ) , were reported to influence susceptibility to lung tumorigenesis in other strains . The fact that common chromosomal locations regulate both inflammation and carcinogenesis suggests a pathogenic role of inflammatory mediators in tumor development that may be exploited for chemoprevention of lung cancer .
