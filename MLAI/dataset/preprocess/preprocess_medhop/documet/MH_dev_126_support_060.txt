The emerging role of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in ovarian cancer . P00533 ( P00533 ) inhibitors are a new biologically targeted therapy , which may offer new hope in the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancers . In this review , we summarize and discuss the results of research to date on P00533 inhibitors with particular emphasis on ovarian cancer . We reviewed data identified by searches of MEDLINE , PubMed , and abstracts from the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings from 1998 to 2006 , with the search terms " Ovarian Cancer, " " P00533 , " " gefitinib , ZD1839 , DB00317 , " " erlotinib , DB00530 , Tarceva, " " DB05424 , " " DB01259 , lapatinib, " " PKI-166, " " Q9Y259 569, " " anti- P00533 antibodies, " " trastuzumab , Herceptin, " " cetuximab , Erbitux , IMC-C225, " " matuzumab , P50402 72000, " " panitumamab , DB01269 , " " pertuzumab , " and " vandetanib , rINN , DB05294 , DB05294 . " Phase II trials of both small molecule inhibitors of P00533 - and antibody-based inhibitors are currently ongoing in ovarian cancer and emerging data suggest that their activity in unselected women with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer is modest , when utilized as a single agent . It is possible that these agents will be highly effective in smaller subsets of patients whose tumors are dependent on P00533 signaling , perhaps through activating mutations in P00533 or its downstream pathway . Targeted therapy with P00533 inhibitors is an untapped potential resource in the treatment of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer . Ongoing trials will elucidate the most effective strategies to use these agents individually or in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents .
