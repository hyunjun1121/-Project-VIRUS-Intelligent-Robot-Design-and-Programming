Tamoxifen enhances erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity through down-regulating AKT-mediated thymidine phosphorylase expression in human non-small-cell lung cancer cells . Tamoxifen is a triphenylethylene nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ( ER ) antagonist used worldwide as an adjuvant hormone therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer . However , the molecular mechanism of tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells has not been identified . P19971 ( TP ) is an enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway which is upregulated in cancers . In this study , tamoxifen treatment inhibited cell survival in two NSCLC cells , H520 and H1975 . Treatment with tamoxifen decreased TP mRNA and protein levels through AKT inactivation . Furthermore , expression of constitutively active AKT ( AKT-CA ) vectors significantly rescued the decreased TP protein and mRNA levels in tamoxifen-treated NSCLC cells . In contrast , combination treatment with PI3K inhibitors ( LY294002 or wortmannin ) and tamoxifen further decreased the TP expression and cell viability of NSCLC cells . Knocking down TP expression by transfection with small interfering RNA of TP enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of tamoxifen . Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) , an orally available small molecular inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase , is approved for clinical treatment of NSCLC . Compared to a single agent alone , tamoxifen combined with erlotinib resulted in cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition synergistically in NSCLC cells , accompanied with reduced activation of phospho-AKT and phospho- P27361 /2 , and reduced TP protein levels . These findings may have implications for the rational design of future drug regimens incorporating tamoxifen and erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC .
