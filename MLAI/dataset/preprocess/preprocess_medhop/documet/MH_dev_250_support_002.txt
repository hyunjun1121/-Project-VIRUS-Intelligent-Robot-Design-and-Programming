Phosphorylation of the P06730 -binding protein Q13541 after exposure of PC12 cells to P01133 and P01138 . Q13541 or the Q13541 regulates the cap-binding activity of P06730 by sequestering P06730 . Binding of elF4E to Q13541 is regulated by phosphorylation of Q13541 . PC12 cells were used to study the signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of Q13541 . Both P01133 and P01138 induced phosphorylation of Q13541 . Wortmannin , a P19957 kinase inhibitor , staurosporine , a PKC inhibitor , and rapamycin , a P42345 inhibitor all blocked the phosphorylation of Q13541 . Of the three inhibitors , only wortmannin was able to inhibit MAPK phosphorylation . This excludes a role for MAPK in P01138 - and P01133 -induced Q13541 phosphorylation in PC12 cells . Apparently , Q13541 was phosphorylated in a P19957 kinase- , PKC- , and P42345 -dependent manner after P01133 or P01138 stimulation . Only P19957 kinase and P42345 are involved in the regulation of the basal level of Q13541 phosphorylation .
