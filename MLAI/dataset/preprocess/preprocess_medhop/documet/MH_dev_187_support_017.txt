Effect of DB00015 and P05121 antibodies on postoperative adhesion formation in a laparoscopic mouse model . BACKGROUND : Postoperative adhesions remain an important clinical problem , accounting for infertility , chronic pain and bowel obstruction . Its prevention is still inadequate and overall poorly understood . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DB00015 ( a recombinant plasminogen activator , r-PA ) and of P05121 antibodies upon adhesion formation in a laparoscopic model . METHODS : Pneumoperitoneum-enhanced adhesions were induced by performing a bipolar lesion in female BALB/c mice and by using pure and humidified CO(2) as insufflation gas for 60 min . In experiment 1 , four doses of 0.125 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 1 mg/0.5 ml r-PA and one and two doses of 1 mg r-PA were administrated i.p . Two control groups were included , one without any treatment and the second one receiving four times 0.5 ml of saline . In experiment 2 , four doses of 0 , 1 , 10 and 100 microg/0.5 ml r-PA were administrated i.p . In experiment 3 , P05121 neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies were injected i.p. after performing the lesion on day 0 and days 2 and 4 . Adhesions were scored after 7 days . RESULTS : Adhesion formation was less with the administration of four doses of 1 microg r-PA ( proportion , p < 0.04 , Wilcoxon ) . An increase in adhesion formation was observed when higher number of doses and amounts of r-PA were used ( Proc GLM , eight groups , two variables , p = 0.05 for the amount of r-PA and p < 0.02 for the number of doses administrated ) . No effect was observed with the P05121 antibodies . CONCLUSIONS : Low-dose i.p. administration of rPA is effective in the prevention of adhesions in a laparoscopic mouse model .
