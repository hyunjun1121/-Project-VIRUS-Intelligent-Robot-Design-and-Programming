TNFα and IFNγ synergistically enhance transcriptional activation of P02778 in human airway smooth muscle cells via P35610 -1 , NF-κB , and the transcriptional coactivator Q92793 . Asthmatic airway smooth muscle ( P17405 ) expresses interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 ( P02778 ) , a chemokine known to mediate mast cell migration into P17405 bundles that has been reported in the airways of asthmatic patients . P02778 is elevated in patients suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , diseases in which corticosteroids are largely ineffective . IFNγ and TNFα synergistically induce P02778 release from human P17405 cells in a steroid-insensitive manner , via an as yet undefined mechanism . We report that TNFα activates the classical NF-κB ( nuclear factor κB ) pathway , whereas IFNγ activates O60674 / P35610 -1α and that inhibition of the JAK/ P35610 pathway is more effective in abrogating P02778 release than the steroid fluticasone . The synergy observed with TNFα and IFNγ together , however , did not lie at the level of NF-κB activation , P35610 -1α phosphorylation , or in vivo binding of these transcription factors to the P02778 promoter . Stimulation of human P17405 cells with TNFα and IFNγ induced histone H4 but not histone H3 acetylation at the P02778 promoter , although no synergism was observed when both cytokines were combined . We show , however , that TNFα and IFNγ exert a synergistic effect on the recruitment of Q92793 ( CBP ) to the P02778 , which is accompanied by increased RNA polymerase II . Our results provide evidence that synergism between TNFα and IFNγ lies at the level of coactivator recruitment in human P17405 and suggest that inhibition of JAK/ P35610 signaling may be of therapeutic benefit in steroid-resistant airway disease .
