Determination of ancestral allele for possible human cancer-associated polymorphisms . To determine ancestral allele in possible cancer-associated polymorphisms , DNA samples from 10 chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) were sequenced for alleles corresponding to 17 polymorphisms : 8 short tandem repeats [ P18510 ( alias IL-1RA ) variable number tandem repeat ( VNTR ) ; P04818 ( previously TS ) VNTR ; AR CAG repeat ; dinucleotide repeats of P22309 , IGF1 , P01579 ( alias P01579 ) , P03372 ( alias P03372 ) , and P00533 ] and 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( P03956 -1607 1G/2G , P08254 -1171 5A/6A , O15527 Ser326Cys , P05091 Gly487Lys , P04637 Arg72Pro , Q9UNQ0 Gln141Lys , P16455 Leu84Phe , P04179 Ala-9Val , and P42898 Ala222Val ) . No chimpanzee polymorphism corresponded to human P18510 VNTR ; the ancestral allele was a repeat lost in humans . Dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms of IGF1 , P01579 , P03372 , and P00533 were shared by chimpanzees , but the length of repeats tended to be longer in humans than in chimpanzees . This tendency was particularly evident for IGF1 . All of the SNPs tested are human-specific nucleotide changes . The ancestral allele 7A was shown to be lost in P08254 -1171 5A/6A . Thus , all of the possible cancer-associated polymorphisms tested have human-specific alleles , and the ancestral allele is lost in three polymorphisms ( P18510 VNTR , P22309 CA repeat , and P08254 -1171 5A/6A ) , suggesting a possible involvement of human-specific alleles in cancer susceptibility .
