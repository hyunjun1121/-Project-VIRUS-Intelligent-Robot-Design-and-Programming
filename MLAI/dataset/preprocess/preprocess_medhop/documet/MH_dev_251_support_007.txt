Induction of lymphokine-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes stimulated by dendritic cells and autologous tumor from a patient with gastric cancer and their effects in vitro . BACKGROUND/AIMS : The purpose of the study was to generate lymphokine-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes stimulated by dendritic cells ( DC ) and autologous tumor from a patient with gastric cancer and to clarify their cytotoxic effects in vitro . METHODOLOGY : DC was induced by interleukin-4 ( P05112 ) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . Then , PBMC was incubated with mitomycin C-treated tumor cells and DC , and following that was activated with P60568 and anti-CD3 . Induction of DC and cytotoxic T cells ( CTL ) were confirmed by the analyses of the cell surface antigens , killing activities , and blocking tests . RESULTS : Induction of DC and cytotoxic T cells ( CTL ) was confirmed by the analyses of the cell surface antigens , killing activities , and blocking tests . In vitro study demonstrated that lymphokine-activated lymphocytes pulsed by DCs and autologous tumor contained the largest population of CTLs , the greatest production of P01579 , and the greatest Q06187 activity . CONCLUSIONS : Those results indicated that CTLs could be generated in vitro from a patient with gastric cancer more successfully by this method than by conventional methods , suggesting the possibility of a new immunotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer .
