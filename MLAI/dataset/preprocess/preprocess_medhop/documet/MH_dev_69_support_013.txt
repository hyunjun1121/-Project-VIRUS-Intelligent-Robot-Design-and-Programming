Gα(olf) mutation allows parsing the role of DB02527 -dependent and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent signaling in DB01235 -induced dyskinesia . Although DB01235 ( DB01235 ) remains the reference treatment of Parkinson 's disease , its long-term beneficial effects are hindered by DB01235 -induced dyskinesia ( LID ) . In the dopamine ( DA ) -denervated striatum , DB01235 activates DA D₁ receptor(D₁R) signaling , including DB02527 -dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) , two responses associated with LID . However , the cause of PKA and P29323 activation , their respective contribution to LID , and their relationship are not known . In striatal neurons , D₁R activates adenylyl-cyclase through Gα(olf) , a protein upregulated after lesion of DA neurons in rats and inpatients . We report here that increased Gα(olf) levels in hemiparkinsonian mice are correlated with LID after chronic DB01235 treatment . To determine the role of this upregulation , we performed unilateral lesion in mice lacking one allele of the Gnal gene coding for Gα(olf) ( Gnal⁺/⁻ ) . Despite an increase in the lesioned striatum,Gα(olf) levels remained below those of unlesioned wild-type mice . In Gnal⁺/⁻ mice , the lesion-induced DB01235 stimulation of DB02527 /PKA-mediated phosphorylation of P42261 Ser845 and Q9UD71 ( 32 kDa DA- and DB02527 -regulated phosphoprotein ) Thr34 was dramatically reduced , whereas P29323 activation was preserved . LID occurrence was similar in Gnal⁺/⁺ and Gnal⁺/⁻ mice after a 10-d DB01235 ( 20 mg/kg ) treatment . Thus , in lesioned animals , Gα(olf) upregulation is critical for the activation by DB01235 of D₁R-stimulated DB02527 /PKA but not P29323 signaling . Although the DB02527 /PKA pathway appears to be required for LID development , our results indicate that its activation is unlikely to be the main source of LID . In contrast , the persistence of DB01235 -induced P29323 activation in Gnal⁺/⁻ mice supports its causal role in LID development .
