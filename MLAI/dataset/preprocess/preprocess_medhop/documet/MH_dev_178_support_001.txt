[ Anti-inflammatory effect of Urtica dioica folia extract in comparison to caffeic malic acid ] . Urtica dioica extract is a traditionary used adjuvant therapeutic in rheumatoid arthritis . The antiphlogistic effects of the urtica dioica folia extract P22304 23 ( Extractum Urticae dioicae foliorum ) and the main phenolic ingredient caffeic malic acid were tested concerning the inhibitory potential on biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites in vitro . The caffeic malic acid was isolated from Urtica folia extract using gel exclusion- and high performance liquid chromatography and identified by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance . Concerning the P09917 products P22304 23 showed a partial inhibitory effect . The isolated phenolic acid inhibited the synthesis of the leukotriene B4 in a concentration dependent manner . The concentration for halfmaximal inhibition ( IC50 ) was 83 microns/ml in the used assay . P22304 23 showed a strong concentration dependent inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase derived reactions . The IC50 were 92 micrograms/ml for P22304 23 and 38 micrograms/ml for the caffeic malic acid . Calculating the content in P22304 23 the caffeic malic acid is a possible but not the only active ingredient of the plant extract in the tested assay systems . It is demonstrated that the phenolic component showed a different enzymatic target compared with P22304 23 . The antiphlogistic effects observed in vitro may give an explanation for the pharmacological and clinical effects of P22304 23 in therapie of rheumatoid diseases .
