Histone deacetylase inhibitors modulate the transcriptional regulation of guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-a gene : interactive roles of modified histones , histone acetyltransferase , p300 , AND Sp1 . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) binds guanylyl cyclase-A/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 /NPRA ) and produces the intracellular second messenger , cGMP , which regulates cardiovascular homeostasis . We sought to determine the function of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) in regulating Npr1 ( coding for P16066 /NPRA ) gene transcription , using primary mouse mesangial cells treated with class-specific HDAC inhibitors ( HDACi ) . Trichostatin A , a pan inhibitor , and mocetinostat ( DB05651 ) , a class I HDAC inhibitor , significantly enhanced Npr1 promoter activity ( by 8- and 10-fold , respectively ) , mRNA levels ( 4- and 5.3-fold , respectively ) , and NPRA protein ( 2.7- and 3.5-fold , respectively ) . However , MC1568 ( class II HDAC inhibitor ) had no discernible effect . Overexpression of Q13547 and Q92769 significantly attenuated Npr1 promoter activity , whereas O15379 and Q9BY41 had no effect . HDACi-treated cultured cells in vitro and intact animals in vivo showed significantly reduced binding of Q13547 and -2 and increased accumulation of acetylated H3- P35527 /14 and H4-K12 at the Npr1 promoter . Deletional analyses of the Npr1 promoter along with ectopic overexpression and inhibition of Sp1 confirmed that HDACi-induced Npr1 gene transcription is accomplished by Sp1 activation . Furthermore , HDACi attenuated the interaction of Sp1 with Q13547 /2 and promoted Sp1 association with p300 and p300/ DB02527 -binding protein-associated factor ; it also promoted the recruitment of p300 and p300/ DB02527 -binding protein-associated factor to the Npr1 promoter . Our results demonstrate that trichostatin A and DB05651 enhanced Npr1 gene expression through inhibition of Q13547 /2 and increased both acetylation of histones ( H3- P35527 /14 , H4-K12 ) and Sp1 by p300 , and their recruitment to Npr1 promoter . Our findings define a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism that governs Npr1 gene transcription .
