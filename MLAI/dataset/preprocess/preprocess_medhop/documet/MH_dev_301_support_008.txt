CXC chemokine receptor 4 is a cell surface receptor for extracellular ubiquitin . Ubiquitin is one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes and plays major biological roles as a post-translational protein modifier . Ubiquitin is also a natural constituent of plasma , and several lines of evidence suggest that extracellular ubiquitin is an immune modulator with anti-inflammatory properties . In addition , ubiquitin treatment has been shown to limit inflammation and reduce organ injury in various disease models and species in vivo . However , its mechanism of action is unknown . Here we show that extracellular ubiquitin is a natural CXC chemokine receptor 4 ( P61073 and CD184 ) agonist . Extracellular ubiquitin promotes intracellular Ca(2+) flux and reduces DB02527 levels through a G protein-coupled receptor that signals via a Galpha(i/o) protein in THP1 cells . O00206 stimulation reduces ubiquitin-binding sites , which enabled identification of four Galpha(i/o) PCRs as ubiquitin receptor candidates . Overexpression of candidate genes in HEK293 cells , gene silencing in THP1 cells , competition binding , and signaling studies with the P61073 agonist stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha ( chemokine ( CXC motif ) ligand 12 ) and inhibitor DB06809 identify P61073 as a functional ubiquitin receptor . Our finding uncovers a fundamentally new aspect of the role of ubiquitin in biology , has implications for the understanding of P61073 -mediated events , and is expected to facilitate development of new therapeutic avenues for a variety of diseases .
