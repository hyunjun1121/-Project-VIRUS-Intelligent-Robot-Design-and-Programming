Global transcriptome analysis of formalin-fixed prostate cancer specimens identifies biomarkers of disease recurrence . Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in American men and there is an unmet need for biomarkers to identify patients with aggressive disease . In an effort to identify biomarkers of recurrence , we performed global RNA sequencing on 106 formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded prostatectomy samples from 100 patients at three independent sites , defining a 24-gene signature panel . The 24 genes in this panel function in cell-cycle progression , angiogenesis , hypoxia , apoptosis , PI3K signaling , steroid metabolism , translation , chromatin modification , and transcription . Sixteen genes have been associated with cancer , with five specifically associated with prostate cancer ( P78543 , P17936 , Q96EB6 , P50539 , and P14324 ) . Validation was performed on an independent publicly available dataset of 140 patients , where the new signature panel outperformed markers published previously in terms of predicting biochemical recurrence . Our work also identified differences in gene expression between Gleason pattern 4 + 3 and 3 + 4 tumors , including several genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and developmental pathways . Overall , this study defines a novel biomarker panel that has the potential to improve the clinical management of prostate cancer .
