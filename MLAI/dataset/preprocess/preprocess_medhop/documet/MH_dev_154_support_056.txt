Topical glucocorticoids downregulate P23219 positive cells in nasal polyps . BACKGROUND : Influx of inflammatory cells is one of the hallmarks of nasal polyposis . As glucocorticoids ( GC ) are known to exhibit strong anti-inflammatory effects , these drugs are frequently used in the treatment of the disease . Part of the anti-inflammatory effects of GC is attributed to their interference with prostanoid synthesis . As cyclooxygenases ( P36551 ) are key enzymes in the synthesis of both pro- ( P23219 , P35354 ) and anti-inflammatory prostanoids ( P35354 ) , we investigated the role of topical GC on P23219 , P35354 and inflammatory markers in nasal polyps ( NP ) . METHODS : Immunohistochemical analysis of inflammatory markers ( P34810 , CD117 , MBP , elastase , IgE , BB-1 , P05112 , P05113 and P05231 ) , P23219 and P35354 was performed on normal nasal mucosa ( NM ) ( n = 18 ) , non-GC treated NP ( n = 27 ) and topical GC treated NP ( n = 12 ) . NP groups were matched for allergy , asthma and ASA intolerance . RESULTS : Increased numbers of eosinophils , P05113 + cells and IgE+ cells and decreased numbers of mastcells are striking features of NP inflammation ( P < 0.05 ) . In addition , increased numbers of P23219 + cells are observed in NP epithelium compared to NM ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : Topical GC significantly reduce the number of P23219 + NP cells ( P < 0.05 ) , but have no significant effect on P35354 + NP cells . No significant reduction in the number of eosinophils is observed for GC treated NP . The number of P05113 + cells is however increased significantly upon GC treatment ( P < 0.05 ) .
