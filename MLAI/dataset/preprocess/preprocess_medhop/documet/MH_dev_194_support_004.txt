P04150 polymorphisms in major depression . Focus on glucocorticoid sensitivity and neurocognitive functioning . Previously , it has been suggested that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis dysregulation and , as a consequence , increased cortisol levels , is not only a state phenomenon , but may also be a trait phenomenon in mood disorders . DB00741 exerts its effects mainly by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and , of particular interest in certain brain regions , the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) . Several GR polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with altered sensitivity of the Q9Y251 axis . Recently , the GR polymorphisms BclI and ER22/23EK have been associated with unipolar depression in several studies . In addition , the ER22/23EK polymorphism seems to be associated with a decreased risk of dementia in healthy individuals . Also , during a depressive episode , carriers of this ER22/23EK variant demonstrated a tendency toward better cognition , as measured by divided attention tests . In this overview , currently known clinically relevant GR and MR polymorphisms are discussed in relation to mood disorders ( both unipolar depression and bipolar disorder ) and cognitive function .
