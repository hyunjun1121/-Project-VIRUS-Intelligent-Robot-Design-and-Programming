The CHOICE trial : adalimumab demonstrates safety , fistula healing , improved quality of life and increased work productivity in patients with Crohn 's disease who failed prior infliximab therapy . BACKGROUND : DB00051 induces and maintains remission in adults with Crohn 's disease . AIM : To evaluate safety , fistula healing , quality of life and work productivity in adalimumab-treated patients who failed infliximab , including primary nonresponders . METHODS : After a ≥8-week infliximab washout , patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn 's disease received open-label adalimumab as induction ( 160/80 mg at weeks 0/2 ) and maintenance ( 40 mg every other week ) therapies . At/after 8 weeks , patients with flare/nonresponse could receive weekly therapy . Minimum study duration was 8 weeks , continuing until the commercial availability of adalimumab for Crohn 's disease . RESULTS : Of 673 patients enrolled , 17 % were infliximab primary nonresponders and 83 % were initial responders . Three percent of patients had serious infections ( mainly abscesses ) . Complete fistula healing was achieved by 34/88 ( 39 % ) patients with baseline fistulas . Improvements in quality of life and work productivity were sustained from week 4 to week 24 for all patients , as well as the subgroup of primary nonresponders . CONCLUSIONS : Blinded clinical trials have shown adalimumab to be both an effective first-line therapy for anti- P01375 -naïve patients and an important treatment option for infliximab-refractory or -intolerant patients . This trial presents open-label experience to support further the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in patients who failed infliximab therapy , including primary nonresponders ( NCT00338650 ) .
