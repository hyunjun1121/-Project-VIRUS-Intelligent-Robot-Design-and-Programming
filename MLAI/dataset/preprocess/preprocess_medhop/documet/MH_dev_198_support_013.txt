Positive correlation between galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( P07902 ) and DB03501 -4'-epimerase ( Q14376 ) activities . OBJECTIVES : The aim of our study was to determine whether the activities of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and DB03501 -4'-epimerase are correlated , and in what way they may influence one another . DESIGN AND METHODS : Enzyme activities were measured in red blood cells from 214 individuals . RESULTS : A statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) positive correlation was observed between P07902 and Q14376 activities . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that P07902 and Q14376 activities are correlated and that Q14376 activity has a greater impact on P07902 activity than vice versa .
