DB00107 and vasopressin receptor polymorphisms interact with circulating neuropeptides to predict human emotional reactions to stress . DB00107 ( OT ) and a polymorphism ( rs53576 ) in the oxytocin receptor gene ( P30559 ) have been independently associated with stress reactivity , whereas oxytocin 's sister peptide , arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and polymorphisms in the vasopressin receptor gene ( P37288 ) have been independently associated with aggressive behavior . In this study , 68 men and 98 women were genotyped for the P30559 rs53576 polymorphism and the P37288 O15537 polymorphism . Baseline and poststressor levels of plasma OT , plasma AVP , positive affect , and anger were assessed . Women , but not men , with high levels of poststressor OT and the GG genotype of rs53576 felt the most positive affect after the stressor . Men , but not women , with high levels of poststressor AVP and the 320 allele of the O15537 polymorphism reported more poststressor anger than noncarriers . These data constitute the first evidence that oxytocin and vasopressin receptor genes interact with levels of OT and AVP to predict sex-specific emotional stress responses .
