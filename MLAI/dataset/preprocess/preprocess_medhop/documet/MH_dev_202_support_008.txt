[ Endothelial progenitor cells related gene expression changes before and early after revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction ] . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to observe the endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) related gene expression changes before and early after revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction . METHODS : Peripheral blood samples were taken from patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction 6 hours and 7 days after P05154 and stenting . Mononuclear cells ( MNCs ) were isolated by Ficoll-density centrifugation and cultured in M-199 medium . After 14 days culture , attaching cells incorporated DiI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein ( EPCs ) were collected and RNA was isolated by Trizol for microarray analysis on 24 genes associated with permissibility/vessel tone ( angiotensin system : P12821 , AGTR-1 , AGTR-2 ; NO system : P29474 ; prostacyclin system : P35354 ; endothelin system : ET-1 , P25101 , ETB ; superoxide anions system : SOD-1 ) , angiogenesis ( adhesion molecule : P33151 ; growth factors and receptors : P17948 , P35968 , P15692 ) and endothelial cell activation ( adhesion molecules expression : P05362 , P13598 , P32942 , P16284 , E-Selectin , L-Selection , P19320 ; change phenotype from antithrombotic to prothrombotic : tPA , uPA , P05121 , P04275 ) . P35968 , P16284 and P33151 positive cells were identified by flow cytometry . RESULT : Eight gene expressions ( AGTR-1 , AGTR-2 , P35354 , P29474 , ET-1 , P25101 , P15692 ) were significantly downregulated 7 days post P05154 compared to pre- P05154 ( P < 0.05 ) . Flow cytometry results showed that P35968 positive cells were also significantly reduced post P05154 than that of before P05154 ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : P05154 down-regulated endothelial progenitor cells related gene expressions in patients with acute myocardial infarction .
