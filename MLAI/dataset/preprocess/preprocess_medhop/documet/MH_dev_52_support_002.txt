Arachidonate cascade , apoptosis , and vitamin E in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hemodialysis patients . BACKGROUND : Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from hemodialysis ( HD ) patients because of upregulation of the P09917 pathway of the arachidonate cascade . 5-Lipoxygenase activity is specifically inhibited by vitamin E both in vitro and in vivo regardless of its administration route . METHODS : The effect of arachidonate cascade enzymes and vitamin E on oxidative stress and apoptosis was investigated in PBMCs from 16 maintenance HD patients treated for at least 6 months with cuprammonium rayon membranes in a two-step crossover study : after a 4-week treatment with vitamin E-coated cuprammonium rayon membranes and again after a 4-week treatment with oral vitamin E. Control PBMCs were obtained from 16 healthy volunteers . RESULTS : Membrane lipoperoxidation , cellular luminescence , membrane fluidity , and leukotriene B(4) content were significantly greater in PBMCs from HD patients ; lipoxygenase was upregulated , but prostaglandin H synthase ( P61457 ) was not affected . Regardless of administration route , vitamin E partially controlled lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress through direct inhibition of P09917 . Cultured PBMCs from HD patients showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells compared with controls . DB00163 markedly reduced cell luminescence , membrane fluidity , and apoptosis , whereas the P61457 inhibitor indomethacin was ineffective . Similar results were obtained with control PBMCs induced to apoptosis by hydrogen peroxide . CONCLUSION : Reported data suggest that the P09917 branch of the arachidonate cascade is only responsible for membrane peroxidation , oxidative stress , and apoptosis of PBMCs of HD patients , and administration of vitamin E may be helpful in the control of oxidative stress-related disease in these subjects .
