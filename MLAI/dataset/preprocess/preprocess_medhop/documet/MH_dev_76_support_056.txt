Impact of clinically relevant mutations on the pharmacoregulation and signaling bias of the calcium-sensing receptor by positive and negative allosteric modulators . DB01012 is predominantly used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism due to end-stage renal failure , but , more recently , its potential clinical efficacy in treating patients with loss-of-function mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) has been recognized . Many clinically relevant P41180 mutations are located in the heptahelical membrane spanning and extracellular loop regions of the receptor , where allosteric modulators are predicted to bind . The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of such mutations on the pharmacoregulation of the P41180 by the positive and negative allosteric modulators , cinacalcet and P0C0P6 -2143 , respectively . Both cinacalcet and P0C0P6 -2143 effectively rescued mutants whose cell surface expression was substantially impaired , suggesting that both classes of drug can stabilize a receptor conformation that is trafficked more effectively to the cell surface . In addition , functional impairments in almost all mutant CaSRs were rescued by either cinacalcet or P0C0P6 -2143 via restoration of intracellular signaling . There was a significantly greater ability of both compounds to modulate agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization than P27361 /2 phosphorylation , indicating that the allosteric modulators engender bias in agonist-stimulated P41180 signaling to different pathways . Three mutations ( G(670)R , P(748)R , and L(773)R ) altered the binding affinity of allosteric modulators to the P41180 , and 3 mutations ( V(817)I , L(773)R , and E(767)K ) altered the cooperativity between the allosteric modulator and Ca(2+)(o) . These findings have important implications for the treatment of diseases associated with P41180 mutations using allosteric P41180 modulators and for analyzing the effects of mutations on the function and pharmacoregulation of the P41180 .
