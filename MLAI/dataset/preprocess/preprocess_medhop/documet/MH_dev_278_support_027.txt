Death receptors 4 and 5 activate Nox1 NADPH oxidase through riboflavin kinase to induce reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptotic cell death . Stimulation of the proapoptotic tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( P50591 ) receptors , death receptors 4 ( DR4 ) and 5 ( DR5 ) , conventionally induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells . Here we report that stimulation of DR4 and/or DR5 by the agonistic protein KD548-Fc , an Fc-fused DR4/DR5 dual-specific Kringle domain variant , activates plasma membrane-associated Nox1 NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide anion and subsequently accumulates intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , leading to sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and eventual apoptotic cell death in human HeLa and Jurkat tumor cells . KD548-Fc treatment induces the formation of a DR4/DR5 signaling complex containing riboflavin kinase ( Q969G6 ) , Nox1 , the Nox1 subunits ( Rac1 , Noxo1 , and Noxa1 ) , P01375 receptor-associated death domain ( Q15628 ) , and Q12933 ( TRAF2 ) . Depletion of Q969G6 , but not the Nox1 subunits , Q15628 and TRAF2 , failed to recruit Nox1 and Rac1 to DR4 and DR5 , demonstrating that Q969G6 plays an essential role in linking DR4/DR5 with Nox1 . Knockdown studies also reveal that Q969G6 , Q15628 , and TRAF2 play critical , intermediate , and negligible roles , respectively , in the KD548-Fc-mediated ROS accumulation and downstream signaling . Binding assays using recombinantly expressed proteins suggest that DR4/DR5 directly interact with cytosolic Q969G6 through Q969G6 -binding regions within the intracellular death domains , and Q15628 stabilizes the DR4/DR5- Q969G6 complex . Our results suggest that DR4 and DR5 have a capability to activate Nox1 by recruiting Q969G6 , resulting in ROS-mediated apoptotic cell death in tumor cells .
