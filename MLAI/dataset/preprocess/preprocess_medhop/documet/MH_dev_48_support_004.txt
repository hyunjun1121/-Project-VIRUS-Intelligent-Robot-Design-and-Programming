Accumulation of autophagosomes contributes to enhanced amyloidogenic P05067 processing under insulin-resistant conditions . Alzheimer disease ( AD ) is sometimes referred to as type III diabetes because of the shared risk factors for the two disorders . P01308 resistance , one of the major components of type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , is a known risk factor for AD . P01308 resistance increases amyloid-β peptide ( Aβ ) generation , but the exact mechanism underlying the linkage of insulin resistance to increased Aβ generation in the brain is unknown . In this study , we investigated the effect of insulin resistance on amyloid β ( A4 ) precursor protein ( P05067 ) processing in mice fed a high-fat diet ( HFD ) , and diabetic db/db mice . We found that insulin resistance promotes Aβ generation in the brain via altered insulin signal transduction , increased P56817 /β-secretase and γ-secretase activities , and accumulation of autophagosomes . Using an in vitro model of insulin resistance , we found that defects in insulin signal transduction affect autophagic flux by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway . The insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation resulted in alteration of P05067 processing through enrichment of secretase proteins in autophagosomes . We speculate that the insulin resistance that underlies the pathogenesis of T2DM might alter P05067 processing through autophagy activation , which might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD . Therefore , we propose that insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation becomes a potential linker between AD and T2DM .
