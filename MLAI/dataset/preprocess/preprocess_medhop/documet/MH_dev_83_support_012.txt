P35354 inhibition attenuates antibody responses against human papillomavirus-like particles . Vaccination to generate protective humoral immunity against infectious disease is becoming increasingly important due to emerging strains of virus , poorly immunogenic vaccines , and the threat of bioterrorism . We demonstrate that cyclooxygenase-2 ( Cox-2 ) is crucial for optimal Ab responses to a model vaccine , human papillomavirus type 16 virus-like particles ( HPV 16 VLPs ) . Cox-2-deficient mice produce 70 % less IgG , 50 % fewer Ab-secreting cells , and 10-fold less neutralizing Ab to HPV 16 VLP vaccination compared with wild-type mice . The reduction in Ab production by Cox-2(-/-) mice was partially due to a decrease in class switching . SC-58125 , a structural analog of the Cox-2-selective inhibitor DB00482 reduced by approximately 70 % human memory B cell differentiation to HPV 16 VLP IgG-secreting cells . The widespread use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Cox-2-selective inhibitory drugs may therefore reduce vaccine efficacy , especially when vaccines are poorly immunogenic or the target population is poorly responsive to immunization .
