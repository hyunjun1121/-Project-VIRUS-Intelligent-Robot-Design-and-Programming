Translational PK-PD modelling of molecular target modulation for the AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator Org 26576 . INTRODUCTION : The Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid ( AMPA ) receptor potentiator Org 26576 represents an interesting pharmacological tool to evaluate the utility of glutamatergic enhancement towards the treatment of psychiatric disorders . In this study , a rat-human translational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic ( PK-PD ) model of AMPA receptor modulation was used to predict human target engagement and inform dose selection in efficacy clinical trials . METHODS : Modelling and simulation was applied to rat plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements to identify a target concentration ( EC(80) ) for AMPA receptor modulation . Human plasma pharmacokinetics was determined from 33 healthy volunteers and eight major depressive disorder patients . From four out of these eight patients , P04141 PK was also determined . Simulations of human P04141 levels were performed for several doses of Org 26576 . RESULTS : Org 26576 ( 0.1-10 mg/kg , i.v. ) potentiated rat hippocampal AMPA receptor responses in an exposure-dependant manner . The rat plasma and P04141 PK data were fitted by one-compartment model each . The rat P04141 PK-PD model yielded an EC(80) value of 593 ng/ml ( 90 % confidence interval 406.8 , 1,264.1 ) . The human plasma and P04141 PK data were simultaneously well described by a two-compartment model . Simulations showed that in humans at 100 mg QD , P04141 levels of Org 26576 would exceed the EC(80) target concentration for about 2 h and that 400 mg P55957 would engage AMPA receptors for 24 h . CONCLUSION : The modelling approach provided useful insight on the likely human dose-molecular target engagement relationship for Org 26576 . Based on the current analysis , 100 and 400 mg P55957 would be suitable to provide ' phasic ' and ' continuous ' AMPA receptor engagement , respectively .
