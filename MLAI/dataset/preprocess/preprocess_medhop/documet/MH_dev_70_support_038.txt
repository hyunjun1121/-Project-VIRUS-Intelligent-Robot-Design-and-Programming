Uptake , cytotoxicity and metabolism of m-azidopyrimethamine and related lipophilic antifolates in SV- P02533 human keratinocytes in vivo . The growth-inhibitory properties of a series of lipophilic diaminopyrimidine antifolates were evaluated in comparison with methotrexate ( MTX ) against SV- P02533 human keratinocytes in vitro under folate-dependent and folate-independent conditions . Under folate-dependent conditions metoprine ( DDMP ) proved more cytotoxic than MTX , despite the greater inhibitory activity of the latter compound against mammalian dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , possibly reflecting differences in cellular accumulation . The significantly lower activity of both compounds under folate-independent conditions indicated P00374 as the primary target . DB00205 ( Q9BRP8 ) , m-azidopyrimethamine ( MZP ) and m-aminopyrimethamine ( Q96HU1 ) , a metabolite of MZP , were approximately equiactive but less cytotoxic than MTX or DDMP . The unexpected activity of Q96HU1 , an inferior P00374 inhibitor , suggests differences in the mechanism of action or cellular transport of the drug , although the reduction of cytotoxicity observed under folate-independent conditions indicate folate metabolism as the cytotoxic locus . In contrast , the cytotoxicity of Q9BRP8 or MZP was not reduced under folate-independent conditions implying an alternative mechanism of action . The uptake of 2-[14C]pyrimethamine by SV- P02533 keratinocytes was rapid with steady-state intracellular concentrations being observed after approximately 100 min , partition of drug into the plasma membrane preceding redistribution and extensive accumulation within the particulate cell components . The previously reported NADPH-dependent metabolism of MZP to Q96HU1 by murine liver microsome preparations was not observed with SV- P02533 keratinocytes nor with murine skin homogenates in the present study .
