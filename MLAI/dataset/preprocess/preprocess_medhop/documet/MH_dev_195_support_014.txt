[ Genetic and clinical and pathological characteristics of breast cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women ] . This study involved 525 breast cancer ( BC ) patients of P24752 -4N0-2M0 stages at the age of 35 years and older . Significant differences in clinical and pathological characteristics between premenopausal and postmenopausal BC patients were found . Mostly marked differences were shown for positive lymph node correlation with distant metastasis , multicentric growth and local recurrence depending on menopause status . The prevalence of various morphological structures in primary tumors was appeared to be associated with different forms of tumor progression in pre- and postmenopausal women . We have studied polymorphisms in 15 genes involved in major cancer related pathways ( apoptosis , interleukins , folate metabolism enzymes genes ) . We found that variant genotypes of P42898 and P00374 genes were associated with an increased BC risk among premenopausal women while polymorphism in Q14116 , p53 genes were associated with BC among postmenopausal women . These results demonstrate novel biological information , which points the different mechanisms contributed to breast cancer progression in premenopausal and postmenopausal women .
