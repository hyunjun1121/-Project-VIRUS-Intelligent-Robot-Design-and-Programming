P41594 regulates excitability and Kv4.2-containing K⁺ channels primarily in excitatory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn . Metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors play important roles in the modulation of nociception . Previous studies demonstrated that mGlu5 modulates nociceptive plasticity via activation of P29323 signaling . We have reported recently that the Kv4.2 K(+) channel subunit underlies A-type currents in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and that this channel is modulated by mGlu5- P29323 signaling . In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that modulation of Kv4.2 by mGlu5 occurs in excitatory spinal dorsal horn neurons . With the use of a transgenic mouse strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) under control of the promoter for the γ-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) -synthesizing enzyme , glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 ( Q99259 ) , we found that these GABAergic neurons express less Kv4.2-mediated A-type current than non- Q99259 -GFP neurons . Furthermore , the mGlu1/5 agonist , ( R,S ) -3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine , had no modulatory effects on A-type currents or neuronal excitability in this subgroup of GABAergic neurons but robustly modulated A-type currents and neuronal excitability in non-GFP-expressing neurons . Immunofluorescence studies revealed that Kv4.2 was highly colocalized with markers of excitatory neurons , such as vesicular glutamate transporter 1/2 , PKCγ , and neurokinin 1 , in cultured dorsal horn neurons . These results indicate that mGlu5-Kv4.2 signaling is associated with excitatory dorsal horn neurons and suggest that the pronociceptive effects of mGlu5 activation in the spinal cord likely involve enhanced excitability of excitatory neurons .
