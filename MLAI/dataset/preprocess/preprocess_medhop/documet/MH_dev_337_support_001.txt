Q9NRI5 -binding proteins in neural development , signalling and schizophrenia . In the decade since Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 ( Q9NRI5 ) was first identified it has become one of the most convincing risk genes for major mental illness . As a multi-functional scaffold protein , Q9NRI5 has multiple identified protein interaction partners that highlight pathologically relevant molecular pathways with potential for pharmaceutical intervention . Amongst these are proteins involved in neuronal migration ( e.g. P05067 , Dixdc1 , P43034 , Q9NXR1 , Q9GZM8 ) , neural progenitor proliferation ( GSK3β ) , neurosignalling ( Q3V6T2 , GSK3β , DB05876 ) and synaptic function ( Kal7 , Q9UKE5 ) . Furthermore , emerging evidence of genetic association ( Q9GZM8 , PCM1 , Q07343 ) and copy number variation ( Q9NXR1 ) implicate several Q9NRI5 -binding partners as risk factors for schizophrenia in their own right . Thus , a picture begins to emerge of Q9NRI5 as a key hub for multiple critical developmental pathways within the brain , disruption of which can lead to a variety of psychiatric illness phenotypes .
