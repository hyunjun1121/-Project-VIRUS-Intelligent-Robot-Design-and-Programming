Challenges and opportunities in targeting the costimulation pathway in solid organ transplantation . Signaling through the costimulatory pathway is critical in the regulation of T cell activation . DB01281 , a selective costimulatory antagonist FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis , binds to P33681 and P42081 on antigen presenting cells , blocking the interaction with P10747 on T cells . DB06681 , a second generation P16410 -Ig with 2 amino acid substitutions , has shown considerable promise in clinical transplantation as part of a maintenance immunosuppression regimen . This review will summarize the role of costimulation in T cell activation , detail the development of costimulation antagonists and highlight the pertinent clinical trials completed and ongoing utilizing belatacept as part of an immunosuppressive regimen in organ transplantation .
