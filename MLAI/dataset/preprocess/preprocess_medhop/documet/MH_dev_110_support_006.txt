Vascular effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , anandamide and N-arachidonoyldopamine ( NADA ) in the rat isolated aorta . The vascular effects of cannabinoids have been compared in the rat isolated aorta . Delta9- DB00470 ( THC ) , anandamide and N-arachidonoyl-dopamine ( NADA ) all caused vasorelaxation to similar degrees in pre-constricted aortae . Vasorelaxation to THC was inhibited by in vivo pre-treatment with pertussis toxin ( 10 microg/kg ) or with the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940 ( ( (-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol ) , acutely or chronically ) , exposure to capsaicin in vitro ( 10 microM for 1 h ) , and de-endothelialisation . Vasorelaxation to anandamide was only inhibited by pertussis toxin and chronic CP55,940 pre-treatment ( 0.4 mg/kg for 11 days ) . Vasorelaxation to NADA was inhibited by pertussis toxin and chronic CP55,940 pre-treatment , and by de-endothelialisation . The vasorelaxant effects of the cannabinoids were not inhibited by cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonism ; however , vasorelaxation to both CP55,940 and THC was inhibited by cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonism . Vasorelaxation to all cannabinoids was enhanced in the presence of indomethacin ( 10 microM ) . THC also caused vasoconstriction of the aorta while anandamide , NADA , CP55,940 and Q08050 55,212-2 ( R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate ) did not . The vasoconstrictor effects of THC were inhibited by in vivo pre-treatment with pertussis toxin or CP55,940 , acute exposure to CP55,940 , cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonism and cyclooxygenase inhibition . These results demonstrate the opposing vascular effects of cannabinoids in the rat aorta , and although vasorelaxation to each of the cannabinoids is of similar magnitude , it is mediated through different pathways . This gives further indication of the different vascular actions of cannabinoid compounds .
