The FGF receptor uses the endocannabinoid signaling system to couple to an axonal growth response . A key role for DAG lipase activity in the control of axonal growth and guidance in vitro and in vivo has been established . For example , DAG lipase activity is required for FGF-stimulated calcium influx into neuronal growth cones , and this response is both necessary and sufficient for an axonal growth response . The mechanism that couples the hydrolysis of DAG to the calcium response is not known . The initial hydrolysis of DAG at the sn-1 position ( by DAG lipase ) will generate 2-arachidonylglycerol , and this molecule is well established as an endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist in the brain . In the present paper , we show that in rat cerebellar granule neurons , P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonists inhibit axonal growth responses stimulated by P19022 and P09038 . Furthermore , three P21554 receptor agonists mimic the P19022 / P09038 response at a step downstream from FGF receptor activation , but upstream from calcium influx into cells . In contrast , we could find no evidence for the P21554 receptor coupling the TrkB neurotrophin receptor to an axonal growth response in the same neurons . The observation that the P21554 receptor can couple the activated FGF receptor to an axonal growth response raises novel therapeutic opportunities .
