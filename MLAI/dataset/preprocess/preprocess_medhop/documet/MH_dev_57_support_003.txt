Heymann antibodies induce complement-dependent injury of rat glomerular visceral epithelial cells . The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro role of the complement membrane attack complex ( MAC ) in the injury induced by nephritogenic anti-brush border vesicle ( Fx1A ) antibodies on rat glomerular visceral epithelial cells ( GEC ) . Both sheep and rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG-induced complement-dependent lysis of cultured GEC . Fab fragments of sheep anti-rat brush border vesicles and polyclonal or monoclonal P98164 IgG were devoid of lytic activity . Shedding of cell-surface antigens induced by sheep or rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG protected GEC from subsequent exposure to lytic antibodies and complement , an effect that was not obtained with Fab fragments . When GEC were incubated with sheep or rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG in capping conditions , the P01024 component was co-redistributed with Heymann immune complexes ; in contrast , the MAC remained diffusely bound to the cell surface , indicating that it was not associated with the antigen-antibody complexes . The MAC was demonstrated on the surface of GEC by immunofluorescence staining with anti-MAC neoantigen and by electron microscopy of negatively stained membranes showing focal clusters of 110 A MAC lesions . When GEC were treated with sheep IgG or rabbit IgG plus P13671 -deficient sera , the cells were not lysed and MAC was not demonstrable on the surface ; however , lytic activity was restored when P13671 -deficient sera were reconstituted with purified P13671 . The results are consistent with the interpretation that injury induced by Heymann antibodies on GEC is MAC-dependent .
