Perinuclear localization of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha is important but not obligatory for coupling with cyclooxygenases . In response to Ca(2+) signaling , cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha ( cPLA(2)alpha ) translocates from the cytosol to the perinuclear membrane , where downstream eicosanoid-synthetic enzymes , such as cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) , are localized . Although the spatiotemporal perinuclear colocalization of cPLA(2)alpha and COXs has been proposed to be critical for their functional coupling leading to prostanoid production , definitive evidence for this paradigm has remained elusive . To circumstantiate this issue , we took advantage of a chimeric cPLA(2)alpha mutant harboring the P06681 domain of protein kinase Calpha , which translocates to the plasma membrane following cell activation . Transfection analyses of the native or chimeric cPLA(2)alpha in combination with P23219 or P35354 revealed that , even though the arachidonate-releasing capacities of native and mutant cPLA(2)alpha were comparable , prostaglandin production by mutant cPLA(2)alpha was markedly impaired as compared with that by native cPLA(2)alpha . We thus conclude that the perinuclear localization of cPLA(2)alpha is preferential , even if not obligatory , for efficient coupling with COXs .
