Adverse dermatological reactions in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with etanercept , an anti-TNFalpha drug . DB00005 is an anti- P01375 drug with marked efficacy in inflammatory arthritis . This review addresses dermatological side effects that have been encountered in our 85 patients on the drug for rheumatoid arthritis , and reviews other reported cutaneous adverse events . Injection site reactions are common and usually self-limiting . We and others have encountered patients with recall site reactions where the four rotated injection sites simultaneously develop a hypersensitivity reaction . In all cases , the rash has responded to antihistamines and the etanercept was thereby continued . Other injection site reactions include discoid lupus and cutaneous vasculitis that respond to cessation of treatment and appropriate therapy . Skin reactions more distant from the injection site are also reviewed , with erythema nodosum , widespread lupus rashes , infections and skin tumours summarised . A patient who developed a purpuric rash at the site of last injection with a drug induced worsening of thrombocytopaenia is described . Although the therapeutic advantages of etanercept outweigh the side effects , clinicians need to be aware of the adverse reactions of these drugs with their increasing use .
