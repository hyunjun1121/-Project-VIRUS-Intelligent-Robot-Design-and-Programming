Molecular dynamics simulations of arachidonic acid-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate complexes with P23219 and P35354 : insights into oxygenation regio- and stereoselectivity . The two cyclooxygenase enzymes , P23219 and P35354 , are responsible for the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis and are the targets of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs aspirin and ibuprofen and the P35354 selective inhibitors , DB00482 , Vioxx , and Bextra . The enzymes are remarkable in that they catalyze two dioxygenations and two cyclizations of the native substrate , arachidonic acid , with near absolute regio- and stereoselectivity . Several theories have been advanced to explain the nature of enzymatic control over this series of reactions , including suggestions of steric shielding and oxygen channeling . As proposed here , selective radical trapping and spin localization in the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate can also be envisioned . Herein we describe the results of explicit , 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations of both P23219 and P35354 with the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate bound in the active site . The enzymes ' influence on the conformation of the pentadienyl radical was investigated , along with the accessible space above and below the radical plane and the width of several channels to the active site that could function as access routes for molecular oxygen . Additional simulations demonstrated the extent of molecular oxygen mobility within the active site . The results suggest that spin localization is unlikely to play a role in enzymatic control of this reaction . Instead , a combination of oxygen channeling , steric shielding , and selective radical trapping appears to be responsible . This work adds a dynamic perspective to the strong foundation of static structural data available for these enzymes .
