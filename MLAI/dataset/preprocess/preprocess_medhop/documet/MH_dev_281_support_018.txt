Activation of MAPKs influences the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes in primary human hepatocytes . We examined the effects of model activators of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) on basal and rifampicin- , phenobarbital- and dioxin-inducible expression of phase I and phase II biotransformation enzymes in primary human hepatocytes . Cells were treated for 24 h with sorbitol ( SOR ) , anisomycin ( ANI ) and epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) in the presence or absence of inducers . The levels of P04798 , P05177 , P20813 , P08684 , P22309 , O75795 , P50225 , Q06520 , O43704 , P08263 , P09210 mRNAs were determined . SOR and P01133 inhibited the expression of the tested genes , while ANI had no effect . We conclude that MAPKs play important role in the transcriptional regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes .
