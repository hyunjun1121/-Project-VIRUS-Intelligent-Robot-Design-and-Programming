Oral epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer : comparative pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . The development of orally active small molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) has led to new treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Patients with activating mutations of the P00533 gene show sensitivity to , and clinical benefit from , treatment with P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( P00533 -TKls ) . First generation reversible DB00171 -competitive P00533 -TKls , gefitinib and erlotinib , are effective as first , second-line or maintenance therapy . Despite initial benefit , most patients develop resistance within a year , 50-60 % of cases being related to the appearance of a T790M gatekeeper mutation . Newer , irreversible P00533 -TKls - afatinib and dacomitinib - covalently bind to and inhibit multiple receptors in the ErbB family ( P00533 , P04626 and Q15303 ) . These agents have been mainly evaluated for first-line treatment but also in the setting of acquired resistance to first-generation P00533 -TKls . DB08916 is the first ErbB family blocker approved for patients with NSCLC with activating P00533 mutations ; dacomitinib is in late stage clinical development . Mutant-selective P00533 inhibitors ( AZD9291 , CO-1686 , HM61713 ) that specifically target the T790M resistance mutation are in early development . The P00533 -TKIs differ in their spectrum of target kinases , reversibility of binding to P00533 receptor , pharmacokinetics and potential for drug-drug interactions , as discussed in this review . For the clinician , these differences are relevant in the setting of polymedicated patients with NSCLC , as well as from the perspective of innovative anticancer drug combination strategies .
