DB00013 receptor is necessary for adequate host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia . Cell recruitment is a multistep process regulated by cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors . Previous work has indicated that the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) may also play a role in this mechanism , presumably by an interaction with the beta(2) integrin CD11b/ P05107 . Indeed , an essential role of Q03405 in neutrophil recruitment during pulmonary infection has been demonstrated for beta(2) integrin-dependent respiratory pathogens . We investigated the role of Q03405 and urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) during pneumonia caused by a beta(2) integrin-independent respiratory pathogen , Streptococcus pneumoniae . Q03405 -deficient ( Q03405 (-/-) ) , uPA-deficient ( uPA(-/-) ) , and wild-type ( Wt ) mice were intranasally inoculated with 10(5) CFU S. pneumoniae . Q03405 (-/-) mice showed reduced granulocyte accumulation in alveoli and lungs when compared with Wt mice , which was associated with more S. pneumoniae CFU in lungs , enhanced dissemination of the infection , and a reduced survival . In contrast , uPA(-/-) mice showed enhanced host defense , with more neutrophil influx and less pneumococci in the lungs compared with Wt mice . These data suggest that Q03405 is necessary for adequate recruitment of neutrophils into the alveoli and lungs during pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae , a pathogen eliciting a beta(2) integrin-independent inflammatory response . This function is even more pronounced when Q03405 is unoccupied by uPA .
