Chronic DB00470 treatment increases DB02527 levels and DB02527 -dependent protein kinase activity in some rat brain regions . When Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta(9)-THC,15 mg/kg ) was injected intraperitoneally twice a day for 6 days , tolerance to its analgesic effect appeared to be complete . Chronic exposure to Delta(9)-THC caused a significant reduction in P21554 receptor binding in all brain areas that contain this receptor . Cannabinoid receptor density was markedly reduced in the cerebellum ( 52 % ) , hippocampus ( 40 % ) and globus pallidum ( 47 % ) compared to 30 % in the cortex and striatum . Chronic exposure enhanced the DB02527 pathway , as shown by the significant increase of DB02527 levels and PKA activity in the areas with receptor down-regulation ( cerebellum , striatum and cortex ) . We propose that the increase in DB02527 cascade is part of the biochemical basis of cannabinoid tolerance .
