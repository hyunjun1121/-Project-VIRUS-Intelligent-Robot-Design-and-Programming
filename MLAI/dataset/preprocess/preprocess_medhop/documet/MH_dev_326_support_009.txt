Q9BYW2 -Î± and survivin involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of DB02342 after global ischemia in rats . Survivin is an anti-apoptotic gene that decreases the apoptosis by depressing the expression of caspase-3 . Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha ( Q16665 ) is a transcription factor specifically activated by hypoxia . 2-methoxyestradiol ( DB02342 ) is an estradiol derivative and a known Q16665 inhibitor . DB02342 decreased apoptosis by inhibiting Q16665 . The aim of the present study was to investigate if survivin is involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of DB02342 . Male adult rats were used to make the global ischemia ( GI ) model . Ten minutes after GI , DB02342 was injected intraperitoneally ( 16 mg/kg weight ) . Rats were killed at 6 hours , 12 hours , 24 hours , 48 hours , 96 hours , and 7 days . GI produced a marked increase in Q16665 expressions in the hippocampus at 6 hours and peaked at 48-96 hours . The expressions of survivin and caspase-3 were increased lightly in a similar time course . These molecular changes were accompanied by massive cell loss and apoptosis in the hippocampal regions . DB02342 treatment reduced the expression of Q16665 , increased survivin expression , and decreased the expression of caspase-3 . These results indicate that survivin and Q16665 were involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of DB02342 treated following GI . DB02342 may decrease the Q16665 expression , up-regulate the survivin expression , inhibit the expression of caspase-3 , and finally reduce apoptosis after GI .
