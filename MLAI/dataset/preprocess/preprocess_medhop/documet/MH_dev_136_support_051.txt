Patterns of care , prognosis , and survival in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) refractory to first-line imatinib and second-line sunitinib . BACKGROUND : Data regarding the management and outcome of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) refractory to 1st-line imatinib and 2nd-line sunitinib are limited . METHODS : Medical records of 223 imatinib-resistant and sunitinib-resistant GIST who were treated in 11 major referral centers were reviewed . RESULTS : The three most frequent drugs used in the 3rd-line setting were : nilotinib n = 67 ( 29.5 % ) , sorafenib n = 55 ( 24.5 % ) , and imatinib n = 40 ( 17.5 % ) . There were 18 patients ( 8 % ) who received best supportive care ( BSC ) only . The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) on 3rd-line treatment were 3.6 months [ 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , 3.1-4.1 ] and 9.2 months ( 95 % CI , 7.5-10.9 ) , respectively . Multivariate analysis showed that , in the 3rd-line setting , albumin level and P10721 / P16234 mutational status were significantly associated with PFS , whereas performance status and albumin level were associated with OS . After adjustment for prognostic factors , nilotinib and sorafenib provided the best PFS and OS . Rechallenge with imatinib was also associated with improved OS in comparison with BSC . CONCLUSION : In the 3rd-line setting , rechallenge with imatinib provided limited clinical benefit but was superior to BSC . DB00398 and nilotinib have significant clinical activity in imatinib-resistant and sunitinib-resistant GIST and may represent an alternative for rechallenge with imatinib .
