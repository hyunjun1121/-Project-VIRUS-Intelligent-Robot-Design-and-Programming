Identification of the fused bicyclic 4-amino-2-phenylpyrimidine derivatives as novel and potent DB05876 inhibitors . 2-Phenyl-4-piperidinyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative ( 2 ) was found to be a new DB05876 inhibitor with moderate Q07343 activity ( IC50=150 nM ) . A number of derivatives with a variety of 4-amino substituents and fused bicyclic pyrimidines were synthesized . Among these , 5,5-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivative ( 18 ) showed potent Q07343 inhibitory activity ( IC50=25 nM ) . Finally , N-propylacetamide derivative ( 31b ) was determined as a potent inhibitor for both Q07343 ( IC50=7.5 nM ) and P01375 -Î± production in mouse splenocytes ( IC50=9.8 nM ) and showed good in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS-induced lung inflammation model in mice ( ID50=18 mg/kg ) . The binding mode of the new inhibitor ( 31e ) in the catalytic site of Q07343 is presented based on an X-ray crystal structure of the ligand-enzyme complex .
