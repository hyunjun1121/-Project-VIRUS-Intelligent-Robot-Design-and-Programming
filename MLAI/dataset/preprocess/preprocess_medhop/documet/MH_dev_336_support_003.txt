Activation of large-conductance , Ca2+-activated K+ channels by cannabinoids . We have examined the effects of the cannabinoid anandamide ( AEA ) and its stable analog , methanandamide ( methAEA ) , on large-conductance , Ca2+-activated K+ ( BK ) channels using human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells , in which the alpha-subunit of the Q12791 ( BK-alpha ) , both alpha- and beta1-subunits ( BK-alphabeta1 ) , or both alpha- and beta4-subunits ( BK-alphabeta4 ) were heterologously expressed . In a whole cell voltage-clamp configuration , each cannabinoid activated BK-alphabeta1 within a similar concentration range . Because methAEA could potentiate BK-alpha , BK-alphabeta1 , and BK-alphabeta4 with similar efficacy , the beta-subunits may not be involved at the site of action for cannabinoids . Under cell-attached patch-clamp conditions , application of methAEA to the bathing solution increased Q12791 activity ; however , methAEA did not alter channel activity in the excised inside-out patch mode even when DB00171 was present on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane . Application of methAEA to P29320 -BK-alpha and P29320 -BK-alphabeta1 did not change intracellular Ca2+ concentration . Moreover , methAEA-induced potentiation of Q12791 currents was not affected by pretreatment with a P21554 antagonist ( AM251 ) , modulators of G proteins ( cholera and pertussis toxins ) or by application of a selective CB2 agonist ( JWH133 ) . Inhibitors of P62158 , PKG , and MAPKs ( W7 , KT5823 , and PD-98059 ) did not affect the potentiation . Application of methAEA to mouse aortic myocytes significantly increased Q12791 currents . This study provides the first direct evidence that unknown factors in the cytoplasm mediate the ability of endogenous cannabinoids to activate Q12791 currents . Cannabinoids may be hyperpolarizing factors in cells , such as arterial myocytes , in which BK channels are highly expressed .
