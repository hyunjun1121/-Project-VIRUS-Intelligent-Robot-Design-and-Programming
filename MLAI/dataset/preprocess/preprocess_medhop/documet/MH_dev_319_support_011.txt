DB00158 transport in mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes and preimplantation embryos . Endogenous folate stores are required in preimplantation embryos of several species , but how folates are accumulated and whether they can be replenished has not been determined . Folates are generally taken up into cells by specific transporters , mainly the reduced folate carrier RFC1 ( P41440 protein ) and the high-affinity folate receptors P15328 and P14207 . Quantitative RT-PCR showed that Slc19a1 mRNA was expressed in mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes ( COCs ) and oocytes , whereas Folr1 showed expression only in preimplantation embryos , increasing from the 2-cell stage onward . The mRNAs encoding Folr2 and the intestinal folate transporter Slc46a1 were not detected . DB00563 ( MTX ) , an antifolate often used as a model substrate for folate transport , exhibited saturable transport in COCs and in preimplantation embryos starting at the 2-cell stage . However , folate transport characteristics differed between COCs and embryos . In COCs , transport of MTX and the reduced folate leucovorin was inhibited by the anion transport inhibitor SITS that blocks RFC1 but was insensitive to dynasore , a specific dynamin inhibitor that instead inhibits folate receptor-receptor mediated endocytosis , whereas the opposite was found in 2-cell embryos and blastocysts . The inhibitor profile and transport properties of MTX and leucovorin in COCs correspond to established transport characteristics of RFC1 ( P41440 ) , whereas those in 2-cell embryos and blastocysts correspond with those of P15328 , consistent with the mRNA expression patterns . Considerable folate was accumulated in COCs via RFC1 , but the presence of cumulus cells did not enhance folate accumulation in the enclosed oocyte , indicating a lack of transfer from cumulus to oocyte .
