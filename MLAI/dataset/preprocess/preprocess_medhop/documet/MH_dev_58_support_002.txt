Analysis of over 10,000 Cases finds no association between previously reported candidate polymorphisms and ovarian cancer outcome . BACKGROUND : Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death among women . In an effort to understand contributors to disease outcome , we evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) previously associated with ovarian cancer recurrence or survival , specifically in angiogenesis , inflammation , mitosis , and drug disposition genes . METHODS : Twenty-seven SNPs in P40337 , P14210 , Q14116 , P22694 , P08183 , P10632 , P18074 , and P07992 previously associated with ovarian cancer outcome were genotyped in 10,084 invasive cases from 28 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium with over 37,000-observed person-years and 4,478 deaths . Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between candidate SNPs and ovarian cancer recurrence or survival with and without adjustment for key covariates . RESULTS : We observed no association between genotype and ovarian cancer recurrence or survival for any of the SNPs examined . CONCLUSIONS : These results refute prior associations between these SNPs and ovarian cancer outcome and underscore the importance of maximally powered genetic association studies . Q9P2X3 : These variants should not be used in prognostic models . Alternate approaches to uncovering inherited prognostic factors , if they exist , are needed .
