Inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity enhances antimycin-induced rat cardiomyocytes apoptosis through activation of MAPK signaling pathway . Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( P05091 ) , a mitochondrial-specific enzyme , has been proved to be involved in oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis , while little is known in cardiomyocytes . This study was aimed at investigating the role of P05091 in antimycin A-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis by suppressing P05091 activity with a specific P05091 inhibitor DB02115 . Antimycin A ( 40μg/ml ) was used to induce neonatal cardiomyocytes apoptosis . DB02115 ( 60μM ) effectively inhibited P05091 activity by 50 % without own effect on cell apoptosis , and significantly enhanced antimycin A-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis from 33.5±4.4 to 56.5±6.4 % ( Hochest method , p < 0.05 ) , and from 57.9±1.9 to 74.0±11.9 % ( FACS , p < 0.05 ) . Phosphorylation of activated MAPK signaling pathway , including extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P27361 /2 ) , c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 was also increased in antimycin A and daidzin treated cardiomyocytes compared to the cells treated with antimycin A alone . These findings indicated that modifying mitochondrial P05091 activity/expression might be a potential therapeutic option on reducing oxidative insults induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis .
