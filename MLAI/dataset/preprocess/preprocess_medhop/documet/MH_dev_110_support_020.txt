Targeting CB2 cannabinoid receptors as a novel therapy to treat malignant lymphoblastic disease . In the current study , we examined whether ligation of CB2 receptors would lead to induction of apoptosis in tumors of immune origin and whether CB2 agonist could be used to treat such cancers . Exposure of murine tumors EL-4 , LSA , and P815 to DB00470 ( THC ) in vitro led to a significant reduction in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis . Exposure of EL-4 tumor cells to the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide led to significant induction of apoptosis , whereas exposure to WIN55212 was not effective . Treatment of EL-4 tumor-bearing mice with THC in vivo led to a significant reduction in tumor load , increase in tumor-cell apoptosis , and increase in survival of tumor-bearing mice . Examination of a number of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines , including Jurkat , Molt-4 , and Sup-T1 , revealed that they expressed CB2 receptors but not P21554 . These human tumor cells were also susceptible to apoptosis induced by THC , HU-210 , anandamide , and the CB2-selective agonist JWH-015 . This effect was mediated at least in part through the CB2 receptors because pretreatment with the CB2 antagonist SR144528 partially reversed the THC-induced apoptosis . Culture of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with THC in vitro reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis . Together , the current data demonstrate that CB2 cannabinoid receptors expressed on malignancies of the immune system may serve as potential targets for the induction of apoptosis . Also , because CB2 agonists lack psychotropic effects , they may serve as novel anticancer agents to selectively target and kill tumors of immune origin .
