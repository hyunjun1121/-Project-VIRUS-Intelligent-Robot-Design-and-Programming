P35222 and cyclin D1 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma of variable histologic grades . OBJECTIVE : To analyze the expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma ( Q9NRJ3 ) of variable histologic grades to establish a correlation between the expression of these proteins and the different histopathologic grades of this neoplasia . DESIGN : Immunohistochemical analysis of Q9NRJ3 . SETTING : Pathological Anatomy Service , Discipline of Oral Pathology , Department of Dentistry , Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte , Natal , Brazil . PATIENTS : Fifteen cases of Q9NRJ3 , graded and categorized according to criteria reported in the literature into 5 tumors with a low grade of malignancy , 4 with an intermediate grade , and 6 with a high grade . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Labeling patterns of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 . RESULTS : No significant difference in beta-catenin labeling patterns was observed between low- and intermediate-grade tumors or between low- and high-grade tumors ( P = .60 and P = .06 , respectively ; Fisher exact test ) , despite a strong tendency toward a difference in the latter . In contrast , a significant difference was noted between intermediate- and high-grade tumors ( P = .03 ) . For cyclin D1 , no labeling was observed in any high-grade cases , and only 3 cases showed overexpression of this protein . Comparison of the labeling patterns among the different histologic grades revealed no significant difference . CONCLUSIONS : The reduced expression of beta-catenin observed in all high-grade MECs is probably due to the loss of its adhesion function , which confers a greater invasive potential to these tumors . The overexpression of cyclin D1 observed in only 3 Q9NRJ3 cases suggests that this protein does not participate in the etiopathogenesis of these tumors , which implies that other genes are likely responsible .
