Review article : new drug formulations , chemical entities and therapeutic approaches for the management of ulcerative colitis . BACKGROUND : Treatment options for ulcerative colitis ( UC ) are expanding with the development of novel drug formulations and dosing regimens and new chemical entities . Although the goals of medical therapy for UC remain unchanged , that is to induce and to maintain remission , focus has also centred on improving patient compliance , modifying the natural course of disease and healing the mucosa . AIM : To examine novel formulations , new chemical entities and novel therapeutic approaches to the management of UC . METHODS : Searches for all studies related to UC treatment in Medline and abstracts from major national and international meetings published in the last 10 years . RESULTS : 5-Aminosalicylic acids ( DB00244 ) remain the standard first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderately active UC . New formulations with altered delivery , and new dosing regimens have demonstrated possible improvements in efficacy compared with historically available preparations and dosing patterns . Once-daily dosing , micropellet formulations,and high-dose tablets offer enhanced efficacy and improved compliance . DB00244 is now recognized as a ligand for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) and it has a role as a chemo-preventive agent in long-standing UC . New colonic release corticosteroid formulations help to limit systemic toxicity ; turmeric , tacrolimus and infliximab have shown promising results . New anti-inflammatory targeted therapies include an anti-CD3 antibody , selective integrin blockers , anti- P60568 antibody and P37231 agonists . CONCLUSION : The evolution of novel oral DB00244 formulations and dosage regimens,and recent development of new molecules have expanded the therapeutic armamentarium of UC .
