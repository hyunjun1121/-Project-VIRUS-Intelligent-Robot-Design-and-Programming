P43119 induces P42224 and P40763 phosphorylations in human erythroleukemia cells : a mechanism requiring PTX-insensitive G proteins , P29323 and JNK . The ability of the human prostacyclin receptor ( hIP ) to regulate the activities of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) has not yet been documented . In the present study , we have delineated the mechanism by which hIP induces P40763 phosphorylations in human erythroleukemia ( HEL ) cells . Stimulation of endogenous hIP by its specific agonist , cicaprost , resulted in P40763 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . Cicaprost-induced P40763 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations were resistant to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) treatment , suggesting that these responses were mediated through PTX-insensitive G proteins . In addition , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , but not p38 MAPK , were shown to be phosphorylated by cicaprost in a time- and concentration-dependent manner via PTX-insensitive G proteins . The levels of the interaction between P40763 , P29323 and JNK were enhanced by cicaprost treatment . The involvement of P04049 , Q02750 /2 and JNK in cicaprost-induced phosphorylations of P40763 was illustrated by the use of their selective inhibitors . In contrast , p38 MAPK did not appear to be required . Similar observations were obtained with P42224 upon stimulation by cicaprost . Taken together , these results demonstrate for the first time that hIP activation by cicaprost can lead to P42224 and P40763 phosphorylations via signaling pathways involving PTX-insensitive G proteins , P29323 and JNK .
