Prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain protein 2 controls NF-κB/p65 transactivation and enhances the catabolic effects of inflammatory cytokines on cells of the nucleus pulposus . Prolyl-4-hydroxylase ( P20941 ) proteins are key in sensing tissue hypoxia . In nucleus pulposus ( NP ) cells , our previous work demonstrated that P20941 isoforms have a differential contribution in controlling hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -α degradation and activity . Recently we have shown that a regulatory relationship exists between Q9H6Z9 and inflammatory cytokines in NP cells . With respect to Q9GZT9 , the most abundant P20941 isoform in NP cells , very little is known concerning its function and regulation under inflammatory conditions that characterize intervertebral disc degeneration . Here , we show that Q9GZT9 is a potent regulator of the catabolic activities of P01375 -α ; silencing of Q9GZT9 significantly decreased P01375 -α-induced expression of catabolic markers including P31431 , P08254 , P45452 , and Q9UNA0 , as well as several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , while partially restoring aggrecan and collagen II expression . Use of NF-κB reporters with ShPHD2 , SiHIF-1α , as well as p65(-/-) , Q9GZT9 (-/-) , and Q9H6Z9 (-/-) cells , shows that Q9GZT9 serves as a co-activator of NF-κB/p65 signaling in Q9BYW2 -independent fashion . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous and exogenously expressed tagged proteins , as well as fluorescence microscopy , indicates that following P01375 -α treatment , Q9GZT9 interacts and co-localizes with p65 . Conversely , loss of function experiments using lentivirally delivered Sh-p65 , Sh-IKKβ , and NF-κB inhibitor confirmed that cytokine-dependent Q9GZT9 expression in NP cells requires NF-κB signaling . These findings clearly demonstrate that Q9GZT9 forms a regulatory circuit with P01375 -α via NF-κB and thereby plays an important role in enhancing activity of this cytokine . We propose that during disc degeneration Q9GZT9 may offer a therapeutic target to mitigate the deleterious actions of P01375 -α , a key proinflammatory cytokine .
