P15692 directly suppresses activation of T cells from ascites secondary to ovarian cancer via P15692 receptor type 2 . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial growth factor action in tumour angiogenesis is well characterised ; nevertheless , it functions as a key element in the promotion of the immune system 's evasion by tumours . We sought to investigate the possible direct effect of P15692 on T-cell activation and through which type of P15692 receptor it exerts this effect on cells isolated from ovarian cancer patients ' ascites . METHODS : T cells isolated from the ascites of ovarian cancer patients were cultured with anti-CD3 and P60568 , with or without P15692 for 14 days and the number of viable T cells was counted . Cytotoxic activity of cultured T cells and expression of P15692 receptor-2 ( P35968 ) , was assayed . RESULTS : The addition of P15692 in cultures significantly reduced the number and proliferation rate of T cells in a dose-dependent manner and CD3(+) T cells expressed P35968 on their surface upon activation . Experiments with specific anti- P35968 antibodies revealed that the direct suppressive effect of P15692 on T-cell proliferation is mediated by P35968 . We also showed that P15692 significantly reduced the cytotoxic activity of T cells . CONCLUSION : Our study showed that ascites-derived T cells secrete P15692 and express P35968 upon activation . Vascular endothelial growth factor directly suppresses T-cell activation via P35968 .
