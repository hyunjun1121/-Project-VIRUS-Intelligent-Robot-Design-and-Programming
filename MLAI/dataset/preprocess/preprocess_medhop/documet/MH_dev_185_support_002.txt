P15692 inhibits tumor cell invasion and mesenchymal transition through a MET/ P35968 complex . Inhibition of P15692 signaling leads to a proinvasive phenotype in mouse models of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) and in a subset of GBM patients treated with bevacizumab . Here , we demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) directly and negatively regulates tumor cell invasion through enhanced recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( P18031 ) to a MET/ P35968 heterocomplex , thereby suppressing P14210 -dependent MET phosphorylation and tumor cell migration . Consequently , P15692 blockade restores and increases MET activity in GBM cells in a hypoxia-independent manner , while inducing a program reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition highlighted by a P55290 to P19022 switch and enhanced mesenchymal features . Inhibition of MET in GBM mouse models blocks mesenchymal transition and invasion provoked by P15692 ablation , resulting in substantial survival benefit .
