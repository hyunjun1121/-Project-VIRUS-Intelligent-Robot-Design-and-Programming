P09237 facilitates immune access to the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . BACKGROUND : Metalloproteinase inhibitors can protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , an animal model for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . P14780 ( P14780 ) has been implicated , but it is not clear if other MMPs are also involved , including matrilysin/ P09237 - an enzyme capable of cleaving proteins that are essential for blood brain barrier integrity and immune suppression . RESULTS : Here we report that P09237 -deficient ( mmp7-/- ) mice on the C57Bl/6 background are resistant to EAE induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( Q16653 ) . Brain sections from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/-mice did not show signs of immune cell infiltration of the CNS , but Q16653 -primed wild-type mice showed extensive vascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration 15 days after vaccination . At the peak of EAE wild-type mice had P09237 immuno-reactive cells in vascular cuffs that also expressed the macrophage markers Iba-1 and Gr-1 , as well as tomato lectin . Q16653 -specific proliferation of splenocytes , lymphocytes , P01730 + and CD8+ cells were reduced in cells isolated from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/- mice , compared with Q16653 -primed wild-type mice . However , the adoptive transfer of splenocytes and lymphocytes from Q16653 -primed mmp7-/- mice induced EAE in naïve wild-type recipients , but not naïve mmp7-/- recipients . Finally , we found that recombinant P09237 increased permeability between endothelial cells in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model . CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that P09237 may facilitate immune cell access or re-stimulation in perivascular areas , which are critical events in EAE and multiple sclerosis , and provide a new therapeutic target to treat this disorder .
