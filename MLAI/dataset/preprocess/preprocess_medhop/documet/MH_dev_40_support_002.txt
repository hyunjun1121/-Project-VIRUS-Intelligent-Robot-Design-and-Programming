[ DB01257 in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ] . Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare acquired clonal of the hematopoietic stem cell due to acquired mutation of the P37287 gene . This results in the lack of two P06744 -anchored membrane proteins involved in the inhibition of complement attack , thus explaining red cells hemolysis . The development of an anti- P01031 monoclonal antibody ( eculizumab ) had profoundly modified the treatment of the the hemolytic form of the disease .
