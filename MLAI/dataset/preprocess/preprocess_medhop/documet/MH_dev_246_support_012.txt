Potent and selective inhibition of human nitric oxide synthases . Inhibition by non-amino acid isothioureas . DB02539 was a potent competitive inhibitor of human nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) , with Ki values of 17 , 36 , and 29 nM for the inducible ( i ) , endothelial ( e ) , and neuronal ( n ) isozymes , respectively . Unlike some potent inhibitors of NOS , no time dependence was observed . DB02539 was not a detectable substrate for P29474 . DB02539 was also a potent inhibitor of mouse P35228 ( Ki value of 5.2 nM ) , and its binding perturbed the spectrum of P35228 consistent with its altering the environment of the bound heme . The optimum binding of S-ethyl- and S-isopropylisothiourea relative to 70 other analogs suggested that these alkyl substitutions fit into a small hydrophobic pocket . Most isothioureas were 2-6-fold selective for the human P35228 ( Ki for P35228 versus Ki for P29474 ) , with one being 19-fold selective . The cyclized mimics of S-ethylisothiourea , 2-NH2-thiazoline , and 2-NH2-thiazole , were also competitive inhibitors of human NOS . A third structural class of inhibitors , bisisothioureas , were , in general , the most selective in their inhibition of human P35228 . S,S'-(1,3-Phenylenebis(1,2-ethanediyl))bisisothiourea was 190-fold selective ( Ki value of 0.047 microM against P35228 versus 9.0 microM against P29474 ) . These results demonstrate that potent and selective inhibition of human NOS isozymes is achievable .
