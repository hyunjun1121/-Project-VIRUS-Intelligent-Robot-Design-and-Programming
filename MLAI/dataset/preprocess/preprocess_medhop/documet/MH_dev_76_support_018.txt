G protein-coupled receptors disrupted in human genetic disease . Genetic variation in G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) results in the disruption of GPCR function in a wide variety of human genetic diseases . In vitro strategies have been used to elucidate the molecular pathologies that underlie naturally occurring GPCR mutations . Various degrees of inactive , overactive , or constitutively active receptors have been identified . These mutations often alter ligand binding , G protein coupling , receptor desensitization , and receptor recycling . The role of inactivating and activating calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) mutations is discussed with respect to familial hypocalciuric hypercalemia ( FHH ) and autosomal dominant hypocalemia ( DB00067 ) . Among DB00067 mutations , those associated with tonic-clonic seizures are discussed . Other receptors discussed include rhodopsin , thyrotropin , parathyroid hormone , melanocortin , follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRHR ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone , vasopressin , endothelin-beta , purinergic , and the G protein associated with asthma ( Q6W5P4 ) . Diseases caused by mutations that disrupt GPCR function are significant because they might be selectively targeted by drugs that rescue altered receptors . Examples of drug development based on targeting GPCRs mutated in disease include the calcimimetics used to compensate for some P41180 mutations , obesity therapeutics targeting melanocortin receptors , interventions that alter GnRHR loss from the cell surface in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and novel drugs that might rescue the Q9H244 receptor in a rare bleeding disorder . The discovery of Q6W5P4 suggests that drug screens against variant GPCRs may identify novel drugs . This review of the variety of GPCRs that are disrupted in monogenic disease provides the basis for examining the significance of common pharmacogenetic variants .
