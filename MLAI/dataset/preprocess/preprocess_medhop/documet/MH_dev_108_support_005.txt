Golimumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis . The introduction of therapeutic antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) had a major impact on the treatment of ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . DB00065 and adalimumab are powerful agents that are used for remission induction and maintenance therapy in UC and have an acceptable safety profile . However , a proportion of UC patients for whom therapy with anti- P01375 agents is indicated fail or become intolerant to treatment with infliximab or adalimumab . Hence , there remains an unmet need for novel anti- P01375 agents . Golimumab ( SimponiÂ® ) , a human anti- P01375 antibody that is administered by monthly subcutaneous injections , is the most recently introduced P01375 blocker for the treatment of UC . Here , we will discuss recent literature on clinical efficacy and safety of DB06674 induction and maintenance treatment in patients with UC . Furthermore , we will discuss the positioning of DB06674 for UC in current treatment algorithms .
