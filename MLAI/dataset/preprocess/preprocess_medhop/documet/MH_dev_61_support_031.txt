Basal cell carcinoma and variants in genes coding for immune response , DNA repair , folate and iron metabolism . Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) is one of the most common neoplasms in the world and its incidence has been increasing worldwide in recent years . BCCs are caused by an interplay between genetic and environment factors . We conducted a case-control association study in BCC patients and controls from Sweden and Finland . Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , P05231 -174G/C , -634G/C , and -597G/A ; P22301 -1082G/A and -592C/A ; IL-1beta-511C/T ; NBS1 exon 5 Glu185Gln ; Q01831 exon 15 Lys939Gln ; P18074 exon 23 Lys751Gln ; P18887 exon 10 Arg399Gln ; O43542 exon 7 Thr241Met ; cyclin D1 exon 4 G870A ; P42898 exon 4 Ala222Val and exon 7 Glu429Ala ; Q30201 exon 4 C282Y were performed by Pyrosequencing and RFLP techniques . Most of the genotype distributions were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) , except for P22301 -1082G/A , where cases with BCC showed a significant deviation from HWE ( P = 0.04 ) . Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the -174 and -597 alleles in the P05231 gene in the present populations . No difference between BCC and controls appeared in any of the SNPs analyzed . Only the combined distributions of TT/AA genotypes in P42898 exon 4 ( C/T ) and exon 7 ( A/C ) showed slight increase in BCC compared to controls ( P < 0.07 , OR : 1.94 ; 95 % CI : 0.96-3.89 ) .
