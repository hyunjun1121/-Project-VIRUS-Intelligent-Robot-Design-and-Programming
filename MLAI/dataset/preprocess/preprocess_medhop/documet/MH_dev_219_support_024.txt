Amelioration of scopolamine induced cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress by Inonotus obliquus - a medicinal mushroom . The present study was aimed to investigate the cognitive enhancing and anti-oxidant activities of Inonotus obliquus ( Chaga ) against scopolamine-induced experimental amnesia . Methanolic extract of Chaga ( Q9NRJ3 ) at 50 and 100 mg kg (-1)doses were administered orally for 7 days to amnesic mice . Learning and memory was assessed by passive avoidance task ( PAT ) and Morris water maze ( MWM ) test . Tacrine ( DB00382 , 10 mg kg ( -1 ) , orally ( p.o ) ) used as a reference drug . To elucidate the mechanism of the cognitive enhancing activity of Q9NRJ3 , the activities of acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , anti-oxidant enzymes , the levels of acetylcholine ( ACh ) and nitrite of mice brain homogenates were evaluated . Q9NRJ3 treatment for 7 days significantly improved the learning and memory as measured by PAT and MWM paradigms . Further , Q9NRJ3 significantly reduced the oxidative-nitritive stress , as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde and nitrite levels and restored the glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels in a dose dependent manner . In addition , Q9NRJ3 treatment significantly decreased the P22303 activity in both the salt and detergent-soluble fraction of brain homogenates . Further , treatment with Q9NRJ3 restored the levels of ACh as did DB00382 . Thus , the significant cognitive enhancement observed in mice after Q9NRJ3 administration is closely related to higher brain anti-oxidant properties and inhibition of P22303 activity . These findings stress the critical impact of Chaga , a medicinal mushroom , on the higher brain functions like learning and memory .
