Loss of Androgen-Regulated MicroRNA 1 Activates P12931 and Promotes Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis . Bone metastasis is the hallmark of progressive and castration-resistant prostate cancers . MicroRNA 1 ( miR-1 ) levels are decreased in clinical samples of primary prostate cancer and further reduced in metastases . P12931 has been implicated as a critical factor in bone metastasis , and here we show that P12931 is a direct target of miR-1 . In prostate cancer patient samples , miR-1 levels are inversely correlated with P12931 expression and a P12931 -dependent gene signature . Ectopic miR-1 expression inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) signaling and bone metastasis in a xenograft model . In contrast , P12931 overexpression was sufficient to reconstitute bone metastasis and P29323 signaling in cells expressing high levels of miR-1 . P10275 ( AR ) activity , defined by an AR output signature , is low in a portion of castration-resistant prostate cancer . We show that AR binds to the miR-1-2 regulatory region and regulates miR-1 transcription . Patients with low miR-1 levels displayed correlated low canonical AR gene signatures . Our data support the existence of an AR-miR-1- P12931 regulatory network . We propose that loss of miR-1 is one mechanistic link between low canonical AR output and P12931 -promoted metastatic phenotypes .
