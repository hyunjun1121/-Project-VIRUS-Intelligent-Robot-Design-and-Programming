P35367 promotes atherosclerotic lesion formation by increasing vascular permeability for low-density lipoproteins . OBJECTIVE : Enhanced endothelial permeability leading to intimal accumulation of low-density lipoproteins ( LDL ) stimulates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions . DB11320 is known to increase vascular permeability . Whether this affects the formation of atherosclerotic lesions , however , remains elusive . METHODS AND RESULTS : P02649 -null ( ApoE(-/-) ) mice treated with a histamine H1 receptor but not an H2 receptor antagonist developed 40 % fewer atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta than placebo-treated controls . Similarly , genetic deletion of the H1 but not the H2 receptor resulted in a 60 % reduction of lesions compared with ApoE(-/-) controls . The H1 receptor enhanced LDL permeability and lipid accumulation in the aorta , whereas plasma lipoprotein levels remained unaltered . In contrast , the H1 receptor did not affect proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells . Bone marrow transplantation confirmed that the formation of atherosclerotic lesions depended on the H1 receptor in vascular cells , whereas its presence in bone marrow-derived cells was irrelevant for plaque development . Mice expressing the H1 receptor exhibited higher levels of the chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 5 and higher numbers of macrophages and T-helper lymphocytes in plaques , higher numbers of circulating lymphocytes , and larger spleens . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that H1 but not H2 receptor activation drives the formation of atherosclerotic lesions through an increased vascular permeability for LDL , which is associated with an enhanced secondary aortic and systemic inflammation . These data open novel perspectives for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease .
