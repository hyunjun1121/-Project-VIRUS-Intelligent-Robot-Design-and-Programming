P10275 abnormalities in identical twins with oligospermia . Clinical and biochemical studies . Identical twin brothers presented with oligospermia , small testes , normal male phenotypes , elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels , and normal or elevated serum testosterone levels . Both men had low to low-normal cytosol androgen receptor binding capacity in cultured fibroblasts from pubic skin biopsy specimens . Qualitative abnormalities of cellular androgen receptors were suggested by low-normal or low nuclear androgen uptake in fibroblasts from both brothers as well as abnormal thermolability and subnormal molybdate stabilization of androgen receptors from one brother . In vivo androgen sensitivity was assessed in one twin following administration of testosterone or the non-aromatizable androgen fluoxymesterone . DB01185 suppressed serum luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone/estradiol-binding globulin , and although testosterone suppressed both serum luteinizing hormone and serum follicle-stimulating hormone , the suppression of serum luteinizing hormone by testosterone was subnormal . Both subjects showed marked exaggeration of the serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone increase after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin , despite normal serum testosterone increases , suggesting a block in testicular 17,20-desmolase , which converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone to testosterone . These studies suggest that oligospermia and block of the enzyme 17,20-desmolase may be the earliest manifestations of androgen resistance , and the finding of the syndrome of oligospermia , normal male phenotype , and androgen receptor abnormalities in identical twins indicates a genetic etiology of this disorder .
