Moving beyond chemotherapy : novel cytostatic agents for malignant mesothelioma . It is now known that vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) are autocrine growth factors in malignant mesothelioma ; epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is also highly overexpressed . Cytotoxic drugs that target these growth factors offer fresh potential for the treatment of mesothelioma . Clinical trials have recently been initiated to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of the P15692 inhibitors SU5416 , bevacizumab and thalidomide . ZD1839 ( DB00317 , AstraZeneca ) , an inhibitor of P00533 tyrosine kinase , is also being evaluated . Two clinical trials are planned to evaluate the two PDGF inhibitors Gleevec ( Imatinib mesylate , STI-571 , Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) and PTK787 ( Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) .
