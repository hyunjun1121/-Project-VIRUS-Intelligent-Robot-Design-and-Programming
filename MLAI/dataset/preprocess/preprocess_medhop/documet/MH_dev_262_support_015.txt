Thalidomide suppresses Up-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus coreceptors P61073 and P51681 on P01730 + T cells in humans . Concurrent infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection increases the expression of HIV coreceptors P61073 and P51681 . Thalidomide has beneficial effects in a number of HIV-associated diseases . The effect of thalidomide on P61073 and P51681 expression on P01730 + T cells was determined . Thalidomide produced a dose-dependent inhibition of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced up-regulation of P61073 and P51681 in vitro . Antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) also attenuated the LPS-induced HIV coreceptor up-regulation , which was not further reduced by thalidomide . Thalidomide ( 400 mg ) was orally administered to 6 men , and their blood was stimulated ex vivo with LPS , staphylococcal or mycobacterial antigens , or antibody to CD3 or P10747 cells . All stimuli induced up-regulation of HIV coreceptors , which was reduced after ingestion of thalidomide . Thalidomide may be beneficial in the treatment of intercurrent infections during HIV infection by reducing the up-regulation of P61073 and P51681 expression on P01730 + T cells induced by bacterial and mycobacterial antigens , by a mechanism that involves inhibition of P01375 .
