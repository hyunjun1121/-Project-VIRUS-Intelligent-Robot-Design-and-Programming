Modulation of tachykinin and cytokine release in patients with coronary disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization . Plasma levels of DB05875 ( SP ) and neurokinin A ( P20366 ) tachykinin and of gamma interferon ( P01579 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) cytokines were assayed in plasma obtained from peripheral blood of 19 patients presenting with stable chronic coronary stenosis and 12 patients with acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Plasma samples were obtained before , during , and after percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) consisting of implantation of a metallic stent . Fourteen healthy subjects without any evident risk factors for coronary artery disease ( CAD ) were also included for comparison at basal time . We found that plasma levels of both P01579 and P01375 were significantly higher in patients with chronic or acute CAD than those in control subjects at the time of presentation . P20366 and P01579 levels were also significantly increased in ACS patients compared with those in patients with stable disease . The analysis performed during and after P05154 revealed that P01579 levels increased 15 min after stent implantation in both chronic and ACS patients and that P01375 levels increased in chronic patients only compared to basal values . In addition , a significant decrease of both P20366 and SPA levels 48 h after the end of the revascularization procedure was observed in ACS patients . These data suggest that modulation of tachykinin and/or cytokine release with proinflammatory activity in chronic or acute cardiac ischemia and during following coronary stenting might play an important role in heart tissue damage and in long-term inflammatory complications of P05154 .
