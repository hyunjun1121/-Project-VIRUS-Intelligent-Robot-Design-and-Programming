Clinical potential of vorapaxar in cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with atherosclerosis . DB09030 ( ZONTIVITY™ , formerly known as P35240 530348 ) is a specific , orally active antagonist of the protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) on platelets . It inhibits thrombin-induced platelet activation by binding to the ectodomain of P25116 . After animal studies and Phase II studies showed that vorapaxar sufficiently inhibits platelet activation without significantly increasing bleeding complications , safety and efficacy of vorapaxar were assessed in two large multicenter trials in patients with coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis . The Thrombin-Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction in Acute Coronary Syndromes ( TRACER ) trial investigated safety and efficacy of vorapaxar in patients with an acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation . The Trial to Assess the Effects of DB09030 in Preventing Heart Attack and Stroke in Patients With Atherosclerosis-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 50 ( TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 ) investigated atherothrombotic events in patients with stable atherosclerosis . Results of both studies suggested that vorapaxar given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy can reduce atherothrombotic events , but increases the risk of mild and moderate bleeding complications . This review article summarizes the main results of TRACER and TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 and suggests patient cohorts that might benefit from treatment with vorapaxar in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy .
