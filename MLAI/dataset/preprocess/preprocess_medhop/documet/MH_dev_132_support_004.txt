Cardiac protective effect of Astragalus on viral myocarditis mice : comparison with DB00790 . In clinical practice , Astragali Radix ( Astragalus ) , the root of Astragalus membranaceus Bunge , has been widely applied to treat patients with viral diseases , including viral myocarditis in China . The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effects of Astragalus on the function of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase ( P16615 ) activity and endothelin system at acute and chronic periods of myocarditis mice induced by CVB(3) infection . Astragalus feeding ( 2.2 mg/kg/day ) could significantly increase the survival rate , alleviate pathological alterations and serum cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) , as well as restore impaired SERCA activity at the acute stage . Low affinity and capacity of ETR were reversed with Astragalus after the first CVB(3) inoculation up to 7 days and after the second virus inoculation up to 150 days . In the meantime , the contents of cardiac ET-1 and P01160 were reduced . Comparison the myocarditis mice treated with DB00790 ( 0.44 mg/kg/day ) , an P12821 inhibitor , shows that Astragalus achieved a similar effect on survival rate , P16615 and ET system . These results indicated that the beneficial effects of Astragalus and DB00790 for treating viral myocarditis might be partly mediated by preserving the functions of SERCA 2 activity and ET system .
