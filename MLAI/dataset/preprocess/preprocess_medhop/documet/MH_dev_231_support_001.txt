Analysis of SNP profiles in patients with major depressive disorder . The present study focused on 91 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 21 candidate genes to find associations with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . In total , 160 healthy controls and 177 patients with MDD were studied . We applied arrayed primer extension ( P27695 ) based genotyping technology followed by association and haplotype analysis . SNPs in P32238 , P21728 , P14416 , and P28335 genes showed nominally significant associations with MDD . None of these associations remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing . Haplotype analysis revealed P32238 haplotypes to be associated with MDD ( global p=0.004 ) . More precisely , we found the GAGT haplotype to be associated with increased risk for MDD ( OR 7.42 , 95 % CI 2.13-25.85 , p=0.002 ) . This haplotype effect remained significant after Bonferroni correction ( p=0.04 after Bonferroni 's adjustment ) . Altogether we were able to find some nominal associations , but due to small sample size these results should be taken as exploratory . However , the effect of GAGT haplotype on the P32238 gene may be considered as increasing the risk for MDD .
