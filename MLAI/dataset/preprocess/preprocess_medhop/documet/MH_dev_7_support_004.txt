A phase-1 trial of bexarotene and denileukin diftitox in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . DB00004 , a genetically engineered fusion protein combining the enzymatically active domains of diphtheria toxin and the full-length sequence for interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) , efficiently targets lymphoma cells expressing the high-affinity P60568 receptor ( IL-2R ) consisting of the alpha/p55/CD25 , beta/p75/CD122 , and gamma/ P31785 /CD132 chains . In vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) retinoid , bexarotene , at biologically relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M , upregulated both the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2R and enhanced 5- to 10-fold the susceptibility of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox . To determine whether this biomodulatory effect could be recapitulated in vivo , we treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of bexarotene ( 75 mg/day-300 mg/day ) and denileukin diftitox ( 18 mcg/kg per day x 3 days every 21 days ) in a phase 1 trial . Overall response was 67 % ( 4 complete responses , 4 partial responses ) . Modulation of IL-2R expression was observed at or above a bexarotene dose of 150 mg/day . Four patients experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia , and 2 had grade 4 lymphopenia . Our results demonstrate that the combination of denileukin diftitox and bexarotene is well tolerated and that even low doses ( 150 mg/day ) of bexarotene are capable of in vivo upregulation of CD25 expression on circulating leukemia cells .
