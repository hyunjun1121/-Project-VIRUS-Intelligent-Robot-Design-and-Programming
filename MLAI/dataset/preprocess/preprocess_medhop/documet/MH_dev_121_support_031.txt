Rationale for double renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade . The clinical benefits of both angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) extend beyond blood pressure reduction to encompass tissue-protective effects in target organs , such as the heart , vasculature , and kidneys , that underlie the reductions in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity seen in large outcome trials . However , these effects are achieved by different mechanisms . P12821 inhibitors reduce circulating and tissue angiotensin II levels and potentiate the beneficial effects of bradykinin , including generation of nitric oxide ( NO ) . By contrast , the protective effects of ARBs are owing to the blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 ( AT(1) ) receptors and possibly also to the stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 ( AT(2) ) receptors , again resulting in NO release . In addition , some ARBs , such as telmisartan , are selective activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) , thereby increasing insulin sensitivity . In contrast to other P37231 ligands , such as the thiazolidinediones , activation of this receptor by telmisartan does not result in weight gain . The complementary mechanisms of action of P12821 inhibitors and ARBs create a rationale for combination therapy in high-risk patients . The benefits of this approach with telmisartan are being investigated in clinical trials , such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial ( ONTARGET ) .
