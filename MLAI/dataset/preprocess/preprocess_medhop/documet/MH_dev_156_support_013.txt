Diverse prostaglandin receptors activate distinct signal transduction pathways in rat myometrium . Attempts were made to identify prostaglandin ( PG ) receptors in rat myometrium , according to the differential rank order of potencies displayed by the natural PGs and their analogues , both at the level of second messenger generation and contraction . In estrogen-treated rat myometrium , PGs [ iloprost = DB01240 greater than DB00917 much greater than 16,16-dimethyl ( DM ) - DB00917 ; sulprostone = misoprostol = 0 ] induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate generation , indicating the contribution of a P43119 . The generation of inositol phosphates was stimulated by PGs ( PGF2 alpha greater than PGD2 much greater than DB00917 = DM- DB00917 much greater than iloprost greater than sulprostone = misoprostol = 0 ) , reflecting a PGF2 alpha-receptor-mediated process , which was insensitive to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) . Contractions caused by PGF2 alpha were closely correlated to PGF2 alpha-receptor activation associated with the phospholipase C pathway . By contrast , contractions evoked by DB00917 , equally mimicked by sulprostone and misoprostol , were abolished by PTX and were independent of phospholipase C activation . In the pregnant myometrium ( day 21 ) , the latter PGE-receptor-mediated mechanism also contributed to contractions caused by DB00917 ( less than microM concn ) . Phospholipase C activation was coupled not only to PGF2 alpha but also to PGE receptors and could be correlated with contractions induced by PGF2 alpha and DB00917 greater than microM concn ) . All PGs tested were coupled to inhibitory G protein-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition , displaying an equipotency that did not allow characterization of the inhibitory PG receptors .
