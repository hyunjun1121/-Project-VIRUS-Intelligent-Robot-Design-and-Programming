5-Azacitidine restores and amplifies the bicalutamide response on preclinical models of androgen receptor expressing or deficient prostate tumors . BACKGROUND : Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the in prostate cancer ( Pca ) progression to a hormone refractory state ( HRPC ) and the current use of agents targeting epigenetic changes has become a topic of intense interest in cancer research . In this regard , 5-Azacitine ( 5-Aza ) represents a promising epigenetic modulator . This study tested the hypothesis that 5-Aza may restore and enhance the responsiveness of HRPC cells to anti-hormonal therapy on P10275 ( AR ) expressing ( 22rv1 ) and AR-deficient ( PC3 ) cells . METHODS : The effects were studied in vitro and in vivo models . This sequential treatment induced in vitro cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in 22rv1 and PC3 tumor cell lines . RESULTS : This combined treatment up-regulated the expression of P48023 , phospho- Q13158 , p16(INKA) , Bax , Bak , and P38936 ( P38936 ) , and inhibited FLIP , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL expression . The re-activation of hormonal response of AR-negative PC3 cell line was partially due to the AR re-expression mediated by 5-Aza treatment . In contrast , the increase in the response to anti-androgenic therapy in 22rv1 did not correlate with AR expression levels . Furthermore , xenograft studies revealed that the combined treatment of 5-Aza with AR-antagonist DB01128 had additive/synergistic effects in repressing tumor growth in vivo and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects seem to be in part mediated by induction of apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS : So , this study strongly suggests a therapeutic potential of 5-Aza in combination with anti-androgen therapy in patients with in AR expressing and AR-deficient HRPC .
