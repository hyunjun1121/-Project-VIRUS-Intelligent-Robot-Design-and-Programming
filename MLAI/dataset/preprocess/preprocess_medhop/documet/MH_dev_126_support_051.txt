Inactivation of Akt by the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib is mediated by HER-3 in pancreatic and colorectal tumor cell lines and contributes to erlotinib sensitivity . Signaling through the receptor for epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is frequently deregulated in solid tumors . Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 , OSI Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Melville , NY ) is a low molecular weight , orally bioavailable inhibitor of the P00533 that has been approved for both non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancers . Previous studies have indicated that sensitivity to P00533 antagonists correlated with HER-3 signaling for non-small cell lung cancer . Herein , we have sought to understand the signaling pathways that mediate erlotinib sensitivity for pancreatic and colorectal cancers . In a panel of 12 pancreatic tumor cell lines , we find that P00533 is coexpressed with HER-3 in all cell lines sensitive to erlotinib but not in insensitive cell lines . Erlotinib can block HER-3 phosphorylation in these sensitive cell lines , suggesting that HER-3 is transactivated by P00533 . Knockdown of HER-3 in BxPC3 , an erlotinib-sensitive pancreatic tumor cell line , results in inhibition of the phosphorylation for both Akt and S6 and is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and reduced sensitivity to erlotinib . Therefore , P00533 transactivation of HER-3 mediates Akt signaling and can contribute to erlotinib sensitivity for pancreatic tumors . We extended our analysis to a panel of 13 colorectal tumor cell lines and find that , like pancreatic , HER-3 is coexpressed with P00533 in the most erlotinib-sensitive cell lines but not in erlotinib-insensitive cell lines . These studies suggest that HER-3 could be used as a biomarker to select patients who are most likely to respond to erlotinib therapy .
