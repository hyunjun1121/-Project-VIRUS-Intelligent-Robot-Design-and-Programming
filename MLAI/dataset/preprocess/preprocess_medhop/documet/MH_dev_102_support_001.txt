The anti-tumor effect of HDAC inhibition in a human pancreas cancer model is significantly improved by the simultaneous inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide , with no satisfactory treatment to date . In this study , we tested whether the combined inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and class I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) may results in a better control of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . The impact of the concomitant HDAC and P35354 inhibition on cell growth , apoptosis and cell cycle was assessed first in vitro on human pancreas BxPC-3 , PANC-1 or CFPAC-1 cells treated with chemical inhibitors ( DB02546 , MS-275 and celecoxib ) or Q13547 /2/3/7 siRNA . To test the potential antitumoral activity of this combination in vivo , we have developed and characterized , a refined chick chorioallantoic membrane tumor model that histologically and proteomically mimics human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . The combination of Q13547 /3 and P35354 inhibition significantly impaired proliferation of BxPC-3 cells in vitro and stalled entirely the BxPC-3 cells tumor growth onto the chorioallantoic membrane in vivo . The combination was more effective than either drug used alone . Consistently , we showed that both Q13547 and O15379 inhibition induced the expression of P35354 via the NF-kB pathway . Our data demonstrate , for the first time in a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) model , a significant action of HDAC and P35354 inhibitors on cancer cell growth , which sets the basis for the development of potentially effective new combinatory therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients .
