gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase and glutathione biosynthesis in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic rat liver oval cell lines . Glutathione synthesis and growth properties were studied in the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase( P19440 )-negative , non-tumorigenic rat liver oval cell line OC/CDE22 , and in its P19440 -positive , tumorigenic counterpart line M22 . DB03408 synthetase ( GGCS ) activities were comparable . Growth rates of M22 cells exceeded those of OC/CDE22 cells at non-limiting and limiting exogenous cysteine concentrations . A monoclonal antibody ( Ab 5F10 ) that inhibits the transpeptidatic but not the hydrolytic activity of P19440 did not affect the growth rates of OC/CDE22 , and decreased those of M22 to the OC/CDE22 level . In DB00143 -depleted M22 , but not in OC/CDE22 cells , the rate and extent of DB00143 repletion with exogenous cysteine and glutamine exceeded those obtained with exogenous cysteine and glutamate . With Ab 5F10 , repletion with cysteine/glutamine was similar to that obtained with cysteine/glutamate . Repletion with exogenous DB00143 occurred only in M22 cells , and was abolished by the P19440 inhibitor acivicin . Repletion with gamma-glutamylcysteine ( GGC ) in OC/CDE22 was resistant to acivicin whereas that in M22 was inhibited by acivicin . Repletion with exogenous DB00143 or cysteinylglycine ( CG ) required aminopeptidase activity and was lower than that obtained with cysteine . Unless reduced , CG disulfide did not support DB00143 repletion . The findings are compatible with the notions that ( i ) P19440 -catalyzed transpeptidation was largely responsible for the growth advantage of M22 cells at limiting cysteine concentration , and for their high DB00143 content via the formation of GGC from a gamma-glutamyl donor ( glutamine ) and cyst(e)ine , and ( ii ) aminopeptidase/dipeptidase activity is rate-limiting in DB00143 repletion when DB00143 or CG serve as cysteine sources .
