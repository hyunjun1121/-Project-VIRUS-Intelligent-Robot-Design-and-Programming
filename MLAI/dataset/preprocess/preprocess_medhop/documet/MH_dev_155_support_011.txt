Inhibition of the striatum-enriched phosphodiesterase Q9Y233 : a novel approach to the treatment of psychosis . Phosphodiesterase 10A ( Q9Y233 ) is a recently identified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase expressed primarily in dopaminoreceptive medium spiny neurons of the striatum . We report that papaverine is a potent , specific inhibitor of Q9Y233 and use this compound to explore the role of Q9Y233 in regulating striatal function . DB01113 administration produces an increase in striatal tissue levels of cGMP and an increase in extracellular DB02527 measured by microdialysis . These cyclic nucleotide changes are accompanied by increases in the phosphorylation of CREB and P29323 , downstream markers of neuronal activation . In rats , papaverine potentiates haloperidol-induced catalepsy , consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of Q9Y233 can increase striatal output and prompting a further evaluation of papaverine in models predictive of antipsychotic activity . DB01113 is found to inhibit conditioned avoidance responding in rats and mice and to inhibit PCP- and amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity in rats . The effects of papaverine on striatal cGMP and CREB and P29323 phosphorylation , as well as on conditioned avoidance responding , were absent in Q9Y233 knockout mice , indicating that the effects of the compound are the result of Q9Y233 inhibition . These results indicate that Q9Y233 regulates the activation of striatal medium spiny neurons through effects on DB02527 - and cGMP-dependent signaling cascades . Furthermore , the present results demonstrate that papaverine has efficacy in behavioral models predictive of antipsychotic activity . Thus , inhibition of Q9Y233 may represent a novel approach to the treatment of psychosis .
