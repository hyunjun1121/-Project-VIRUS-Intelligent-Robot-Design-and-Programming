Comparative cytotoxicity of folate-based inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and 5-fluorouracil +/- leucovorin in MGH-U1 cells . P04818 ( TS ) is a critical enzyme in the synthesis of DNA and an important target for cancer chemotherapy . DB00544 ( 5FU ) combined with leucovorin ( LV ) has been used to inhibit TS , and inhibition is dependent on the formation of a ternary complex between a folate cofactor , TS , and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate ( FdUMP ) , a metabolite of FU . The folate-based TS inhibitors CB3717 , its analogs , and BW1843U89 have been synthesized as specific inhibitors of TS that do not require activation or the presence of a cofactor . We have compared the cytotoxicity of 5FU +/- LV with that of these folate-based TS inhibitors in human bladder cancer MGH-U1 cells using a colony-forming assay . After a 6-h exposure , FU+LV , CB3717 , dCB3717 , or P06681 methyl dideazafolate analogs demonstrated similar cytotoxic potency that was 0.96 to 2.9 times that of 5FU alone . A 24-h exposure did not increase the potency of 5FU+LV relative to 5FU alone , but there was a marked increase in the cytotoxicity of the dideazafolates as compared with 5FU+LV . Similarly , BW1843U89 was more cytotoxic than 5FU/LV . This was reflected in a 3.2- to 1333-fold decrease in the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) . Simultaneous exposure to LV and thymidine ( TdR ) protected MGH-U1 cells from the cytotoxicity of CB3717 , its analogs , and BW1843U89 . We conclude that ( a ) the folate-based TS inhibitors are more potent than 5FU+LV after a 24-h exposure , ( b ) protection by LV and TdR indicates that TS inhibition is the primary site of action , and ( c ) BW1843U89 is more potent than D1694 in MGH-U1 cells .
