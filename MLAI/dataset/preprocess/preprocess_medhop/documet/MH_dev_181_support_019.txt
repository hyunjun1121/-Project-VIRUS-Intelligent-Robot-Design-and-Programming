Engineering toxin-resistant therapeutic stem cells to treat brain tumors . Pseudomonas exotoxin ( PE ) potently blocks protein synthesis by catalyzing the inactivation of elongation factor-2 ( P13639 ) . Targeted PE-cytotoxins have been used as antitumor agents , although their effective clinical translation in solid tumors has been confounded by off-target delivery , systemic toxicity , and short chemotherapeutic half-life . To overcome these limitations , we have created toxin-resistant stem cells by modifying endogenous P13639 , and engineered them to secrete PE-cytotoxins that target specifically expressed ( interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 ) or overexpressed ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) in glioblastomas ( GBM ) . Molecular analysis correlated efficacy of PE-targeted cytotoxins with levels of cognate receptor expression , and optical imaging was applied to simultaneously track the kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition and GBM cell viability in vivo . The release of P35225 -PE from biodegradable synthetic extracellular matrix ( sECM ) encapsulated stem cells in a clinically relevant GBM resection model led to increased long-term survival of mice compared to P35225 -PE protein infusion . Moreover , multiple patient-derived GBM lines responded to treatment , underscoring its clinical relevance . In sum , integrating stem cell-based engineering , multimodal imaging , and delivery of PE-cytotoxins in a clinically relevant GBM model represents a novel strategy and a potential advancement in GBM therapy .
