DB00877 induces Q8NHJ6 (high) Q8N423 (high) dendritic cells promoting a new immunoregulatory pathway . Q8NHJ6 (high) Q8N423 (high) dendritic cells ( DCs ) may cause anergy in P01730 (+)CD45RO(+)CD25(+) T cells transforming them into regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) . Here , we tested whether chronic exposure to rapamycin may modulate this immunoregulatory pathway in renal transplant recipients . Forty renal transplant patients with biopsy-proven chronic allograft nephropathy and receiving calcineurin inhibitors were randomly assigned to either calcineurin inhibitor dose reduction or withdrawal with rapamycin introduction . At conversion and 2 years thereafter , we measured the rapamycin effects on circulating DCs ( BDCA1/ Q8WTT0 and Q8NHJ6 / Q8N423 expression ) , P01730 (+)/CD25(high)/Foxp3(+) Tregs , CD8(+)/ P10747 (-) T cells , and the Th1/Th2 balance in graft biopsies . In rapamycin-treated patients , peripheral Q8WTT0 (+) cells were significantly increased along with Q8NHJ6 / Q8N423 (+) DCs . The number of circulating P01730 (+)/CD25(high)/Foxp3(+)/ P16410 (+) Tregs , CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells , and P17693 serum levels were higher in the rapamycin-treated group . The number of Q8NHJ6 / Q8N423 (+) Q8WTT0 (+) DC was directly and significantly correlated with circulating Tregs and CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells . Q8NHJ6 / Q8N423 expression was increased in kidney biopsies at the end of the study period along with a significant bias toward a Th2 response within the graft only in the rapamycin-treated patients . Thus , rapamycin induces the upregulation of Q8NHJ6 and Q8N423 on the DC surface , and this effect is associated with an increase in the number of Tregs and expansion of the CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cell population . This suggests that P42345 inhibition may promote a novel immunoregulatory pathway .
