Higher levels of activation markers and chemokine receptors on T lymphocytes in the cervix than peripheral blood of normal healthy women . Heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) is the predominant mode of infection world-wide . To better understand sexual transmission of HIV-1 in women we have analysed virus co-receptor and cellular activation marker expression on T lymphocyte subsets from the cervical epithelium and have made comparisons with peripheral blood T cells . Intraepithelial cervical T lymphocytes were obtained with a cytobrush , immunolabelled and analysed by flow cytometry . Activation markers ( Q07108 , CD25 and HLA-DR ) were found to be more highly expressed on cervical than on blood T lymphocytes . These higher levels of activation on cervical T lymphocyte subsets could facilitate HIV-1 infection . P61073 was expressed at marginally higher levels than P51681 on T cells from the cervical epithelium and peripheral blood . Thus , the preferential transmission of macrophage tropic strains of HIV-1 following sexual contact can not be explained solely on the expression of chemokine co-receptors by T lymphocyte subsets .
