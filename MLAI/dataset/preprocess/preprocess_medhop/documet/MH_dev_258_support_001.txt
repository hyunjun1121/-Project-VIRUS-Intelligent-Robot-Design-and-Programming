Effects of repeated administration of tetrahydroaminoacridine ( DB00382 ) on muscarinic receptor subtypes in the rat brain . The effects of a chronic treatment ( 21 days ) with the acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) inhibitor tetrahydroaminoacridine ( DB00382 ) on muscarinic receptors subtypes were investigated at various times after the last administration of the drug , in various brain areas including cortex , striatum , hippocampus and cerebellum . Forty eight hours after the end of chronic DB00382 treatment , the number of muscarinic receptors , labelled with [(3)H] Q5H8A3 , was significantly lowered in the cortex and the striatum but not in the hippocampus or cerebellum . High affinity pirenzepine binding sites ( M(1) receptors ) , directly assayed using [(3)H]pirenzepine saturation assays or estimated by pirenzepine [(3)H] Q5H8A3 competition , were lowered only in the cortex and in the striatum of DB00382 -treated rats . In contrast , the number of low affinity pirenzepine sites ( M(2) receptors ) , was not significantly modified . At shorter wash-out period ( 18 h ) , the density of M(1) receptors decreased by 26 , 46 and 52 % in the hippocampus , cerebral cortex and striatum , respectively . In all cases , K(d) values remained unchanged suggesting that the loss of M(1) sites was not due to a modification of radioligand affinity for the receptors . Although DB00382 displayed a micromolar affinity for M(1) and M(2) receptors in vitro , this P22303 inhibitor did not interfere with the receptor assays since no trace of residual free DB00382 was detected in rat brain at 48 h post-treatment . These results suggest that chronic treatment with DB00382 produced a selective down-regulation of M(1) receptors ; they also indicate that these receptors may be regulated differently in cortical , striatal , hippocampal or cerebellar regions .
