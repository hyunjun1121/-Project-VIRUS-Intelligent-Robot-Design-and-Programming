D2-dopamine receptor and alpha2-adrenoreceptor-mediated analgesic response of quercetin . DB04216 , a bioflavonoid ( 100-300 mg/kg ) produced dose dependent increase in tail-flick latency , the analgesic effect being sensitive to reversal by naloxone ( 1 mg/kg ) . Prior treatment with haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg ) , D1/D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol , sulpiride ( 50 mg/kg ) , a selective D2 receptor antagonist , yohimbine ( 5 mg/kg ) , a alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist but not by P35240 23390 a , selective D1 receptor antagonist blocked this response . DB00714 ( 1 mg/kg ) a mixed D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist , and quinpirole ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , a selective D2 receptor agonist also produced antinociception , that was reversed by haloperidol ( 1 mg/kg ) , sulpiride ( 50 mg/kg ) , but not by yohimbine ( 5 mg/kg ) . The antinociceptive action of quercetin ( 200 mg/kg ) was potentiated by D2 agonist quinpirole ( 0.2 mg/kg ) . P21728 agonist SKF38393 ( 10 and 15 mg/kg ) failed to alter the antinociceptive effect of quercetin ( 200 mg/kg ) . DB04216 ( 200 mg/kg ) reversed reserpine ( 2 mg/kg-4 hr ) induced hyperalgesia , which was reversed by sulpiride but not by yohimbine . Thus , a role of dopamine D2 and alpha2-adrenoreceptors is postulated in the antinociceptive action of quercetin .
