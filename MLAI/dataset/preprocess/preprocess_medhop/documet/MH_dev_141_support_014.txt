Role of SCH79797 in maintaining vascular integrity in rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Plasma thrombin concentration is increased after subarachnoid hemorrhage ( Q53FZ2 ) . However , the role of thrombin receptor ( protease-activated receptor-1 [ P25116 ] ) in endothelial barrier disruption has not been studied . The aims of this study were to investigate the role of P25116 in orchestrating vascular permeability and to assess the potential therapeutics of a P25116 antagonist , SCH79797 , through maintaining vascular integrity . METHODS : SCH79797 was injected intraperitoneally into male Sprauge-Dawley rats undergoing Q53FZ2 by endovascular perforation . Assessment was conducted at 24 hours after Q53FZ2 for brain water content , Evans blue content , and neurobehavioral testing . To explore the role of P25116 activation and the specific mechanism of SCH79797 's effect after Q53FZ2 , Western blot , immunoprecipitation , and immunofluorescence of hippocampus tissue were performed . A P38936 -activated kinase-1 ( PAK1 ) inhibitor , IPA-3 , was used to explore the underlying protective mechanism of SCH79797 . RESULTS : At 24 hours after Q53FZ2 , animals treated with SCH79797 demonstrated a reduction in brain water content , Evans blue content , and neurobehavioral deficits . SCH79797 also attenuated P25116 expression and maintained the level of vascular endothelial-cadherin , an important component of adherens junctions . Downstream to P25116 , c-Src-dependent activation of P38936 -activated kinase-1 led to an increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial-cadherin ; immunoprecipitation results revealed an enhanced binding of phosphorylated vascular endothelial-cadherin with endocytosis orchestrator Î²-arrestin-2 . These pathological states were suppressed after SCH79797 treatment . CONCLUSIONS : P25116 activation after Q53FZ2 increases microvascular permeability , at least , partly through a P25116 -c-Src- P38936 -activated kinase-1-vascular endothelial-cadherin phosphorylation pathway . Through suppressing P25116 activity , SCH79797 plays a protective role in maintaining microvascular integrity after Q53FZ2 .
