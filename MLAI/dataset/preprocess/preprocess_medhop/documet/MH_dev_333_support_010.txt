c7E3 Fab inhibits human tumor angiogenesis in a SCID mouse human skin xenograft model . The alphavbeta3 integrin plays an important role in tumor growth and angiogenesis . Inhibition of this receptor by intact bivalent antibodies has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth . In this study we tested the chimeric Fab of DB00054 ( c7E3 Fab ) , an antibody reactive with human platelet P08514 /IIIa and alphavbeta3 to determine if it would inhibit in vivo angiogenesis and tumor growth in a SCID mouse/human skin tumor growth and angiogenesis model . c7E3 Fab inhibited human tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth . These data suggest monovalent antibody fragments devoid of antibody effector function can have efficacy in preclinical models of angiogenesis .
