FIPSDock : a new molecular docking technique driven by fully informed swarm optimization algorithm . The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding is of great importance for rational drug design . We present herein a novel docking algorithm called as FIPSDock , which implements a variant of the Fully Informed Particle Swarm ( FIPS ) optimization method and adopts the newly developed energy function of AutoDock 4.20 suite for solving flexible protein-ligand docking problems . The search ability and docking accuracy of FIPSDock were first evaluated by multiple cognate docking experiments . In a benchmarking test for 77 protein/ligand complex structures derived from GOLD benchmark set , FIPSDock has obtained a successful predicting rate of 93.5 % and outperformed a few docking programs including particle swarm optimization ( Q9P0Z9 )@AutoDock , SODOCK , AutoDock , DOCK , Glide , GOLD , FlexX , Surflex , and MolDock . More importantly , FIPSDock was evaluated against Q9P0Z9 @AutoDock , SODOCK , and AutoDock 4.20 suite by cross-docking experiments of 74 protein-ligand complexes among eight protein targets ( P24941 , P03372 , F2 , Q16539 , P22894 , P45452 , Q07343 , and O76074 ) derived from Sutherland-crossdock-set . Remarkably , FIPSDock is superior to Q9P0Z9 @AutoDock , SODOCK , and AutoDock in seven out of eight cross-docking experiments . The results reveal that FIPS algorithm might be more suitable than the conventional genetic algorithm-based algorithms in dealing with highly flexible docking problems .
