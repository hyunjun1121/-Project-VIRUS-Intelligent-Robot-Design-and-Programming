Interleukin-1β causes excitotoxic neurodegeneration and multiple sclerosis disease progression by activating the apoptotic protein p53 . BACKGROUND : Understanding how inflammation causes neuronal damage is of paramount importance in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and in other neurodegenerative diseases . Here we addressed the role of the apoptotic cascade in the synaptic abnormalities and neuronal loss caused by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 -α ) in brain tissues , and disease progression caused by inflammation in relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) patients . RESULTS : The effect of IL-1β , but not of P01375 -α , on glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents was blocked by pifithrin-α ( DB00522 ) , inhibitor of p53 . The protein kinase C ( PKC ) /transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( Q8NER1 ) pathway was involved in IL-1β-p53 interaction at glutamatergic synapses , as pharmacological modulation of this inflammation-relevant molecular pathway affected DB00522 effects on the synaptic action of IL-1β . IL-1β-induced neuronal swelling was also blocked by DB00522 , and IL-1β increased the expression of P38936 , a canonical downstream target of activated p53.Consistent with these in vitro results , the Pro/Pro genotype of p53 , associated with low efficiency of transcription of p53-regulated genes , abrogated the association between IL-1β cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) levels and disability progression in RRMS patients . The interaction between p53 and P04141 IL-1β was also evaluated at the optical coherence tomography ( O75051 ) , showing that IL-1β-driven neurodegenerative damage , causing alterations of macular volume and of retinal nerve fibre layer thickness , was modulated by the p53 genotype . CONCLUSIONS : Inflammatory synaptopathy and neurodegeneration caused by IL-1β in RRMS patients involve the apoptotic cascade . Targeting IL-1β-p53 interaction might result in significant neuroprotection in MS .
