Irreversible P00533 -TKIs : dreaming perfection . In the last few years , the treatment of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) has dramatically changed . Presence of activating mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( P00533 ) identified a particular group of NSCLC patients with different clinical characteristics and outcome . For P00533 mutant patients first-generation P00533 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as gefitinib and erlotinib , represent the best therapeutic option in first , second and maintenance setting . Unfortunately , all patients develop acquired resistance and despite an initial benefit , virtually all patients progress due to the development of resistance . Several molecular mechanisms are responsible for acquired resistance and the two prominent are the up-regulation of the downstream signal by mesenchymal-epidermal transition ( MET ) amplification and the emergence of T790M P00533 gatekeeper mutation . Preclinical and early clinical trials suggested a potential efficacy of a new class of panHER inhibitor , also called irreversible or covalent inhibitor , in overcome acquired resistance related to T790M . DB08916 , dacomitinib and neratinib , are currently in development in different setting and results from these trials are awaited in order to establish the role of these new compounds in the treatment of NSCLC .
