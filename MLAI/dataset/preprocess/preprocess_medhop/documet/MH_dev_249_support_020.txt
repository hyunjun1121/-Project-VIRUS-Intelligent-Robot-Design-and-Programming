Mice deficient in phosphodiesterase-4A display anxiogenic-like behavior . RATIONALE : Phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) are a super family of enzymes responsible for the halting of intracellular cyclic nucleotide signaling and may represent novel therapeutic targets for treatment of cognitive disorders . DB05876 is of considerable interest to cognitive research because it is highly expressed in the brain , particularly in the cognition-related brain regions . Recently , the functional role of Q07343 and Q08499 , two of the four DB05876 subtypes ( P27815 , B , C , and D ) , in behavior has begun to be identified ; however , the role of P27815 in the regulation of behavior is still unknown . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this study was to characterize the functional role of P27815 in behavior . METHODS : The role of P27815 in behavior was evaluated through a battery of behavioral tests using P27815 knockout ( KO ) mice ; urine corticosterone levels were also measured . RESULTS : P27815 KO mice exhibited improved memory in the step-through-passive-avoidance test . They also displayed anxiogenic-like behavior in elevated-plus maze , holeboard , light-dark transition , and novelty suppressed feeding tests . Consistent with the anxiety profile , P27815 KO mice had elevated corticosterone levels compared with wild-type controls post-stress . Interestingly , P27815 KO mice displayed no change in object recognition , Morris water maze , forced swim , tail suspension , and duration of anesthesia induced by co-administration of xylazine and ketamine ( suggesting that P27815 KO may not be emetic ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that P27815 may be important in the regulation of emotional memory and anxiety-like behavior , but not emesis . P27815 could possibly represent a novel therapeutic target in the future for anxiety or disorders affecting memory .
