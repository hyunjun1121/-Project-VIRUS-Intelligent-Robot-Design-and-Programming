Risk stratification of intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia : integrative analysis of a multitude of gene mutation and gene expression markers . Numerous molecular markers have been recently discovered as potential prognostic factors in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It has become of critical importance to thoroughly evaluate their interrelationships and relative prognostic importance . Gene expression profiling was conducted in a well-characterized cohort of 439 AML patients ( age < 60 years ) to determine expression levels of EVI1 , P19544 , P10415 , P08183 , Q8WXS3 , P36888 , P28906 , P14902 , ERG and Q10571 . A variety of AML-specific mutations were evaluated , that is , P36888 , P06748 , N- DB01367 , K- DB01367 , O75874 , P48735 , and P49715 (DM/SM) ( double/single ) . Univariable survival analysis shows that ( 1 ) patients with P36888 (ITD) mutations have inferior overall survival ( OS ) and event-free survival ( O43281 ) , whereas P49715 (DM) and P06748 mutations indicate favorable OS and O43281 in intermediate-risk AML , and ( 2 ) high transcript levels of Q8WXS3 , P28906 , Q10571 , EVl1 , and ERG predict inferior OS and O43281 . In multivariable survival analysis , P28906 , ERG , and P49715 (DM) remain significant . Using survival tree and regression methodologies , we show that P49715 (DM) , P28906 , and P48735 mutations are capable of separating the intermediate group into 2 AML subgroups with highly distinctive survival characteristics ( OS at 60 months : 51.9 % vs 14.9 % ) . The integrated statistical approach demonstrates that from the multitude of biomarkers a greatly condensed subset can be selected for improved stratification of intermediate-risk AML .
