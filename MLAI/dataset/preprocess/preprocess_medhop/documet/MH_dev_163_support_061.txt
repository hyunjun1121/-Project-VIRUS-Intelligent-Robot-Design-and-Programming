Role of P49336 and beta-catenin in colorectal adenocarcinoma . Colorectal adenocarcinoma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality . The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays an important role in colon cancers . However , relatively little is known about the regulatory mechanism of beta-catenin in colon cancers . P49336 is a cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) member of the mediator complex that couples transcriptional regulators to the basal transcriptional machinery , and is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of key pathways involved in colon cancers . To determine the relationship between P49336 and beta-catenin expressions , a population-based study was conducted for immunohistochemical staining analysis of tumor tissues , and Western blot analysis and P49336 interference studies of colon cancer cell lines . The hypothesis that colorectal cancers with P49336 expression have distinct clinical , prognostic and molecular attributes was tested . Among 127 colorectal cancers , P49336 expression was detected in 96 ( 76 % ) tumors by immunohistochemistry . P49336 and beta-catenin expression had significant positive correlation with carcinogenesis , tumor progression and patient survival . Immunohistochemically , P49336 expression in colorectal cancer was independently associated with beta-catenin activation ( P=0.0002 ) . However , beta-catenin expression was not completely suppressed by P49336 interference in the colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 , HT-29 and SNU- P01031 . These data support a potential link between P49336 and beta-catenin , and suggest that P49336 may identify a subset of colon cancer patients with a poor prognosis . However , control of P49336 is not an effective therapeutic strategy through beta-catenin regulation of general colon cancer .
