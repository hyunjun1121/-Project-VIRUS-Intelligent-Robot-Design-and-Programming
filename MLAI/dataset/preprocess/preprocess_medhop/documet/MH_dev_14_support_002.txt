DB01076 Increases P17813 , Q15796 , Phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 Expression in ApoE/ P01130 Double Knockout Mice . AIM : P17813 is a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to affect transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) expression by affecting SMAD proteins in vitro . Thus , in this study we stepped forward to elucidate whether endoglin is co-expressed with Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 proteins and P29474 in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE/ P01130 double knockout mice . In addition , we sought whether endoglin expression as well as the expression of Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 is affected by atorvastatin treatment . METHODS : Two-month-old female ApoE/ P01130 double knockout mice were divided into two groups . The control group was fed with the western type diet whereas in the atorvastatin group , atorvastatin at dose 100 mg/kg per day was added to the same diet . Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis of endoglin , Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 expressions in aorta were performed . RESULTS : The biochemical analysis showed that administration of atorvastatin significantly decreased level of total cholesterol , VLDL , LDL , TAG , and significantly increased level of HDL cholesterol . Fluorescence immunohistochemistry showed endoglin co-expression with Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 and P29474 in aortic endothelium covering atherosclerotic lesions in both control and atorvastatin treated mice . Western blot analysis demonstrated that atorvastatin significantly increased expression of endoglin , Q15796 , phosphorylated Q15796 /3 , and P29474 in mice aorta . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest , that endoglin might be interesting marker of endothelial dysfunction and/or atherogenesis which is upregulated by statins implicating potential beneficial role of endoglin and its pathway in atherosclerosis .
