Buspirone anti-dyskinetic effect is correlated with temporal normalization of dysregulated striatal P21728 signalling in DB01235 -treated rats . Dopamine replacement with l-DOPA is the most effective therapy in Parkinson 's disease . However , with chronic treatment , half of the patients develop an abnormal motor response including dyskinesias . The specific molecular mechanisms underlying dyskinesias are not fully understood . In this study , we used a well-characterized animal model to first establish the molecular differences between rats that did and did not develop dyskinesias . We then investigated the molecular substrates implicated in the anti-dyskinetic effect of buspirone , a 5HT1A partial agonist . Striatal protein expression profile of dyskinetic animals revealed increased levels of the dopamine receptor (DR)D3 , ΔFosB and phospho (p)CREB , as well as an over-activation of the P21728 signalling pathway , reflected by elevated ratios of phosphorylated Q9UD71 and P28482 . Buspirone reduced the abnormal involuntary motor response in dyskinetic rats in a dose-dependent fashion . Buspirone ( 4 mg/kg ) dramatically reduced the presence and severity of dyskinesias ( by 83 % ) and normalized Q9UD71 and P28482 phosphorylation ratios , while the increases in P35462 , ΔFosB and pCREB observed in dyskinetic rats were not modified . Pharmacological experiments combining buspirone with 5HT1A and P35462 antagonists confirmed that normalization of both pDARPP32 and pERK2 is required , but not sufficient , for blocking dyskinesias . The correlation between pDARPP32 ratio and dyskinesias was significant but not strong , pointing to the involvement of convergent factors and signalling pathways . Our results suggest that in dyskinetic rats P35462 striatal over-expression could be instrumental in the activation of P21728 -downstream signalling and demonstrate that the anti-dyskinetic effect of buspirone in this model is correlated with P21728 pathway normalization .
