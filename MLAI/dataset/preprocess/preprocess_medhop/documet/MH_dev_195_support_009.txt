Reduced folate carrier and dihydrofolate reductase expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia may predict outcome : a Children 's Cancer Group Study . PURPOSE : DB00563 is a major component of current treatment regimens for children with acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) . Potential mechanisms of methotrexate resistance include impaired drug uptake , decreased drug retention , and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) amplification . The purpose of this study was to assess whether reduced folate carrier ( P41440 ) and P00374 expression in untreated leukemic blasts correlated with outcome . METHODS : Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to measure P41440 and P00374 mRNA expression in leukemic blasts from 40 newly diagnosed patients with ALL obtained in a blinded fashion from Children 's Cancer Group studies . RESULTS : Low P41440 expression at diagnosis correlated significantly with an unfavorable event free survival . Surprisingly , low , not high , P00374 expression correlated significantly with an unfavorable event-free survival . Proliferative cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) expression demonstrated a weak inverse relationship between sample P12004 and P00374 or P41440 expression , suggesting that P00374 and P41440 expression may be markers for factors other than drug resistance . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that impaired transport may be an important mechanism of intrinsic methotrexate resistance in ALL , and P00374 expression also may be an important prognostic factor in ALL . Additional studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism for the correlation of low P00374 expression with poor outcome .
