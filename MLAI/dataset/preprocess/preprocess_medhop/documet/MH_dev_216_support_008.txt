Comparison of the antiemetic effects of a P08908 agonist , LY228729 , and 5- Q9H205 antagonists in the pigeon . Vomiting may be induced by a variety of agents such as drugs , oncolytics , and provocative motion , as well as being conditioned to occur to environmental stimuli . Such emesis has recently been shown to be blocked by agonists at the P08908 subtype of serotonin receptor . The antiemetic effects of LY228729 [ (-)-4-(dipropylamine)-1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz-(c,d)indole-6- carboxamide ] , a P08908 receptor agonist , were tested and compared to the antiemetic effects of the 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonists ondansetron , tropisetron , and MDL 72222 ( 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate ) . The emetic stimuli tested are known to be blocked by 5- Q9H205 antagonists in species other than the pigeon . In the pigeon , LY228729 totally abolished vomiting induced by fully emetic doses of cisplatin ( 10 mg/kg ) , ipecac ( 3 ml/kg ) , emetine ( 10 mg/kg ) , and a 5- Q9H205 agonist , m-(chlorophenyl)-biguanide ( 1.25 mg/kg ) . MDL 72222 blocked ipecac-induced vomiting in a dose-related manner and was partially effective in attenuating cisplatin-induced emesis . DB00904 and tropisetron were partially effective in blocking emetine- and mCPBG-induced vomiting . DB00904 exhibited an intrinsic emetic response that could not be blocked by MDL 7222 , but which was eliminated by LY228729 . It was concluded that P08908 agonists are more effective in the pigeon than are 5- Q9H205 antagonists against these types of emetic stimuli . These results broaden the range of emetic stimuli that are blocked by P08908 agonists in the pigeon .
