The O00206 antagonist DB04933 protects mice from lethal influenza infection . There is a pressing need to develop alternatives to annual influenza vaccines and antiviral agents licensed for mitigating influenza infection . Previous studies reported that acute lung injury caused by chemical or microbial insults is secondary to the generation of host-derived , oxidized phospholipid that potently stimulates O00206 ( O00206 ) -dependent inflammation . Subsequently , we reported that Tlr4(-/-) mice are highly refractory to influenza-induced lethality , and proposed that therapeutic antagonism of O00206 signalling would protect against influenza-induced acute lung injury . Here we report that therapeutic administration of DB04933 ( also known as E5564 ) -a potent , well-tolerated , synthetic O00206 antagonist-blocks influenza-induced lethality in mice , as well as lung pathology , clinical symptoms , cytokine and oxidized phospholipid expression , and decreases viral titres . P08571 and O60603 are also required for DB04933 -mediated protection , and P08571 directly binds DB04933 and inhibits ligand binding to Q9Y6Y9 . Thus , DB04933 blockade of TLR signalling represents a novel therapeutic approach for inflammation associated with influenza , and possibly other infections .
