Effect of NC-1900 , an active fragment analog of arginine vasopressin , and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism on performance of a passive avoidance task in mice . In this study , we investigated the effect of administration of inhibitors of each of the arachidonic acid metabolism pathways and the effect of co-administration of these inhibitors with NC-1900 , a fragment analog of arginine vasopressin , on step-through passive avoidance task performance . All drugs were administered just after the acquisition trial in the passive avoidance task . Intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v. ) administration of nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA , 1 and 10 microg ) , a phospholipase A2 ( P04054 ) and lipoxygenase ( P28300 ) inhibitor , and of arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone ( Q06187 , 1 and 10 microg ) , a specific P04054 inhibitor caused reductions in latency on the retention trial . The i.c.v. administration of either of baicalein ( 0.1-10 microg ) , a P16050 inhibitor , or AA-861 ( 0.1-10 microg ) , a 5- P28300 inhibitor , did not influence the latency . Intraperitoneal administration of indomethacin ( 20 mg/kg ) , a non-specific P36551 inhibitor , or NS-398 ( 10 mg/kg ) , a specific P35354 inhibitor , impaired performance on the retention trial in the task , while piroxicam ( 20 mg/kg ) , a specific P23219 inhibitor , did not . Subcutaneous administration of NC-1900 ( 0.1 ng/kg ) ameliorated the reduction of latency caused by NDGA , Q06187 , indomethacin , or NS-398 . These results suggested that the P35354 pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism may be important for learning and/or memory in the passive avoidance task in mice , and that the ameliorating effect of NC-1900 , in part , is due to mimicking of the effects of metabolites of the P35354 pathway .
