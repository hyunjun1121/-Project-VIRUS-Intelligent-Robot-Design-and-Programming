DB00480 inhibits osteoclastogenesis , survival factors and bone-remodeling markers in multiple myeloma . Osteolytic bone disease in multiple myeloma ( MM ) is caused by enhanced osteoclast ( OCL ) activation and inhibition of osteoblast function . DB00480 and bortezomib have shown promising response rates in relapsed and newly diagnosed MM , and bortezomib has recently been reported to inhibit OCLs . We here investigated the effect of lenalidomide on OCL formation and osteoclastogenesis in comparison with bortezomib . Both drugs decreased alpha V beta 3-integrin , tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells and bone resorption on dentin disks . In addition , both agents decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) secretion of bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) derived from MM patients . We identified PU.1 and pERK as major targets of lenalidomide , and nuclear factor of activated T cells of bortezomib , resulting in inhibition of osteoclastogenesis . Furthermore , downregulation of cathepsin K , essential for resorption of the bone collagen matrix , was observed . We demonstrated a significant decrease of growth and survival factors including macrophage inflammatory protein-alpha , B-cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand . Importantly , in serum from MM patients treated with lenalidomide , the essential bone-remodeling factor O14788 , as well as the O14788 / O00300 ratio , were significantly reduced , whereas osteoprotegerin ( O00300 ) was increased . We conclude that both agents specifically target key factors in osteoclastogenesis , and could directly affect the MM-OCL-BMSCs activation loop in osteolytic bone disease .
