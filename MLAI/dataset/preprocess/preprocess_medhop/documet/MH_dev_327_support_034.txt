Pharmacodynamic effects and mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma . PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the P15056 inhibitor vemurafenib in P15056 (V600)-mutant melanoma , leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy . METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 ( BRIM-2 ) , patients received oral doses of vemurafenib ( 960 mg twice per day ) . Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling , cell-cycle progression , and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry , DNA sequencing , or somatic mutation profiling . Results DB08881 inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression . An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies ( n = 22 ; P = .013 ) . Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response . Baseline mutations in Q02750 (P124) coexisting with P15056 (V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples ; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses . Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated P27361 /2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary P01111 (Q61) mutations or Q02750 (Q56P) or Q02750 (E203K) mutations . These two activating Q02750 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors . CONCLUSION DB08881 inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic P15056 signaling through the MAPK pathway . Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in P01111 and Q02750 in subsets of patients . The data suggest that inhibition downstream of P15056 should help to overcome acquired resistance .
