Comparison of low fat and low carbohydrate diets on circulating fatty acid composition and markers of inflammation . Abnormal distribution of plasma fatty acids and increased inflammation are prominent features of metabolic syndrome . We tested whether these components of metabolic syndrome , like dyslipidemia and glycemia , are responsive to carbohydrate restriction . Overweight men and women with atherogenic dyslipidemia consumed ad libitum diets very low in carbohydrate ( VLCKD ) ( 1504 kcal : % CHO:fat:protein = 12:59:28 ) or low in fat ( LFD ) ( 1478 kcal : % CHO:fat:protein = 56:24:20 ) for 12 weeks . In comparison to the LFD , the VLCKD resulted in an increased proportion of serum total n-6 PUFA , mainly attributed to a marked increase in arachidonate ( 20:4n-6 ) , while its biosynthetic metabolic intermediates were decreased . The n-6/n-3 and arachidonic/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio also increased sharply . Total saturated fatty acids and 16:1n-7 were consistently decreased following the VLCKD . Both diets significantly decreased the concentration of several serum inflammatory markers , but there was an overall greater anti-inflammatory effect associated with the VLCKD , as evidenced by greater decreases in P01375 , P05231 , P10145 , P13500 , P16581 , I- P62158 , and P05121 . Increased 20:4n-6 and the ratios of 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 and n-6/n-3 are commonly viewed as pro-inflammatory , but unexpectedly were consistently inversely associated with responses in inflammatory proteins . In summary , a very low carbohydrate diet resulted in profound alterations in fatty acid composition and reduced inflammation compared to a low fat diet .
