Gremlin gene expression in bovine retinal pericytes exposed to elevated glucose . AIM : To assess the influence of high extracellular glucose on the expression of the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) antagonist , gremlin , in cultured bovine retinal pericytes ( BRPC ) . METHODS : BRPC were cultured under conditions of 5 mM and 30 mM d-glucose for 7 days and total RNA was isolated . Gremlin mRNA levels were correlated , by RT-PCR , with other genes implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and the signalling pathways in high glucose induced gremlin expression were probed using physiological inhibitors . Gremlin expression was also examined in the retina of streptozotocin induced diabetic mice . RESULTS : High glucose stimulated a striking increase in BRPC gremlin mRNA levels in parallel with increases in mRNA for the growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , transforming growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) , and connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ) and changes in other genes including fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) . High glucose triggered gremlin expression was modulated by anti-TGFbeta antibody , by the uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation , CCCP , and by inhibition of Q96HU1 -kinase ( MAPK ) activation . Striking gremlin expression was observed in the outer retina of diabetic mice and also at the level of the vascular wall . CONCLUSIONS : Gremlin gene expression is induced in BRPC in response to elevated glucose and in the retina of the streptozotocin induced diabetic mouse . Its expression is modulated by hyperglycaemic induction of the MAPK , reactive oxygen species , and TGFbeta pathways , all of which are reported to have a role in diabetic fibrotic disease . This implicates a role for gremlin in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy .
