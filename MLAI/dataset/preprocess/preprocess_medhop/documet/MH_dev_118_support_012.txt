Constitutive activation of P51681 and P41597 induced by conformational changes in the conserved TXP motif in transmembrane helix 2 . P51681 is a G protein-coupled receptor for RANTES , MIP-1alpha , MIP-1beta , and P80075 that functions as the front line coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection . To elucidate the mechanism for P51681 activation , this coreceptor was expressed in yeast coupled to the pheromone response pathway and a constitutively active mutant ( P62158 ) was derived by random mutagenesis . Conversion of DB00156 -82 in the highly conserved TXP motif in transmembrane helix 2 to Pro , DB00117 , DB00135 , DB00125 , or Lys conferred autonomous signaling activity in yeast and mammalian cells . This substitution also imparted constitutive signaling to P41597 in yeast and mammalian cells , but not P32246 , P51677 , CCR4 , P25025 , or P61073 . The P51681 - P62158 , but not the P41597 - P62158 had a reduction in ligand binding affinity . Whereas the amplitude of calcium mobilization induced by RANTES stimulation was lower in the P51681 - P62158 than the wild-type ( WT ) receptor , P13500 induced a higher signal in the P41597 - P62158 than in P41597 -WT . The chemotactic response of P51681 - P62158 (T82P) to RANTES was similar to that of P51681 -WT , but P51681 - P62158 (T82K) was dramatically decreased . The chemotactic response of P41597 -WT and P41597 - P62158 (T94K) were similar . These findings extend insight into the role of the TXP motif in the mechanism for P51681 signaling . P41597 , the receptor most closely genetically related to P51681 , shared a similar signaling mechanism , but other receptors containing the TXP motif did not . The expression of P51681 and P41597 in yeast and the availability of variants with autonomous signaling represent critical tools for characterizing receptor antagonists and developing approaches to block their role in human diseases .
