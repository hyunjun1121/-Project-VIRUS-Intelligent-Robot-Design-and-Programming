Characterization of DB05005 -B , an orally bioavailable antagonist of the P51686 chemokine receptor , for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease . The chemokine system represents a diverse group of G protein-coupled receptors responsible for orchestrating cell recruitment under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions . Chemokine receptor 9 ( P51686 ) is a chemokine receptor known to be central for migration of immune cells into the intestine . Its only ligand , O15444 , is expressed at the mucosal surface of the intestine and is known to be elevated in intestinal inflammation . To date , there are no reports of small-molecule antagonists targeting P51686 . We report , for the first time , the discovery of a small molecule , DB05005 -B , which is an orally bioavailable , selective , and potent antagonist of human P51686 . DB05005 -B inhibited P51686 -mediated Ca(2+) mobilization and chemotaxis on Molt-4 cells with IC(50) values of 5.4 and 3.4 nM , respectively . In the presence of 100 % human serum , DB05005 -B inhibited P51686 -mediated chemotaxis with an IC(50) of 33 nM , and the addition of α1-acid glycoprotein did not affect its potency . DB05005 -B inhibited chemotaxis of primary P51686 -expressing cells to O15444 with an IC(50) of 6.8 nM . DB05005 -B was an equipotent inhibitor of O15444 -directed chemotaxis of both splice forms of P51686 ( CCR9A and CCR9B ) with IC(50) values of 2.8 and 2.6 nM , respectively . DB05005 -B also inhibited mouse and rat P51686 -mediated chemotaxis . Inhibition of P51686 with DB05005 -B results in normalization of Crohn 's disease such as histopathology associated with the P01375 (ΔARE) mice . Analysis of the plasma level of drug associated with this improvement provides an understanding of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for P51686 antagonists in the treatment of intestinal inflammation .
