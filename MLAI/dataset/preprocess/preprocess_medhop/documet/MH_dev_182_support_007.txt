P04150 signaling in a bronchial epithelial cell line . Glucocorticoids are an effective anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of asthma . The anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids may be due to the inhibition of transcription factors that regulate cytokine synthesis . Because of the potential role of the bronchial epithelium in asthmatic inflammation and the possibility that this cell may be the main target of inhaled glucocorticoids , we have characterized glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and GR signaling in the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B . Western blot analysis and radioligand binding studies demonstrated that BEAS-2B cells have functional GR that bind to dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) ( dissociation constant = 5.6 nM and maximal density of binding sites = 228 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg protein ) . GR were activated by DB00514 as assessed using a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid . Transfection of BEAS-2B cells with an activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) reporter construct followed by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) treatment resulted in a fivefold induction of reporter gene activity . Transfection with a nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B reporter construct followed by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) treatment resulted in a 10-fold induction of reporter gene activity . DB00514 ( 10(-7) M ) markedly repressed both the induced AP-1 and NF-kappa B activity . The GR antagonist DB00834 inhibited the repressive effect of DB00514 on P01375 -induced NF-kappa B activity by 81 % but only counteracted the repressive effect of DB00514 on TPA-induced AP-1 activity by 43 % . These studies demonstrate that cross-signaling between AP-1 and NF-kappa B with GR may explain the anti-inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids in airway epithelial cells .
