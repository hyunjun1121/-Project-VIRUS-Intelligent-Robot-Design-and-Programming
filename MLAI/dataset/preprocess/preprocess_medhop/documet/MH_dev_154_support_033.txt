DB00013 induces proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells : characterization of structural elements required for growth factor function . Ovarian cancer metastasis is associated with an increase in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor Q03405 . We present evidence that binding of uPA to Q03405 provokes a mitogenic response in the human ovarian cancer cell line OV-MZ-6 in which endogenous uPA production had been significantly reduced by stable uPA ' antisense ' transfection . High molecular weight ( HMW ) uPA , independent of its enzymatic activity , produced an up to 95 % increase in cell number concomitant with 2-fold elevated [3H]thymidine incorporation as did the catalytically inactive but Q03405 binding amino-terminal fragment of uPA , P39905 . uPA-induced cell proliferation was significantly decreased by blocking uPA/ Q03405 interaction by the monoclonal antibody IIIF10 and by soluble Q03405 . The efficiency of the Q03405 binding synthetic peptide cyclo19,31 uPA19-31 to enhance OV-MZ-6 cell growth proved this molecular domain to be the minimal structural determinant for uPA mitogenic activity . Dependence of uPA-provoked cell proliferation on Q03405 was further demonstrated in Raji cells which do not express Q03405 and were thus not induced by uPA . However , upon transfection with full-length Q03405 , Raji cells acquired a significant growth response to HMW uPA and P39905 .
