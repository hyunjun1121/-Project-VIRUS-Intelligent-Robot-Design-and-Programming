[ Recent advances on the studies of the platelet 's inhibition and aggregation. State of the art of new Q9H244 antagonists ] . The interaction of ADP with its platelet receptor Q9H244 plays a crucial role in platelet activation and thrombogenesis . This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical trials of specific antagonists of Q9H244 . DB00758 is a thienopyridine with proven antithrombotic efficacy , but it has some important drawbacks : i ) it is a pro-drug that needs to be metabolized to its active metabolite ; ii ) it has a delayed onset and offset of action ; iii ) there is high inter-individual variability in pharmacological response . Prasugrel is also a thienopyridine , with faster onset of action and more uniform inhibition of platelet function compared to clopidogrel , accounting for lower incidence of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) and higher incidence of both non-CABG ( Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ) related bleeding complications . Two direct and reversible Q9H244 antagonists , cangrelor and ticagrelor , are characterized by rapid onset and reversal of platelet inhibition . DB06441 did not prove superior to clopidogrel in preventing thrombotic events in patients undergoing P05154 . DB08816 proved to be superior to clopidogrel in preventing major adverse cardiac events in ACS patients , but was , like prasugrel , was associated with higher frequency of non-CABG-related bleeding complications . A shorter period of drug discontinuation before surgery was necessary in ticagrelor-treated patients compared to clopidogrel-treated patients to limit the severity of post-surgical bleeding .
