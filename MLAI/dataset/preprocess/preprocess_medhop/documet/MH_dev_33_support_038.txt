Interaction of murine peritoneal leukocytes and mesothelial cells : in vitro model system to survey cellular events on serosal membranes during inflammation . All serosal cavities including peritoneum are lined with a simple squamous mesothelium . Primary culture of murine mesothelial cells has been established to study their cellular interactions with peritoneal leukocytes . The mesothelial character was determined by the cytokeratin and vimentin expression . The mesothelial cells expressed P05362 and P16070 molecules . The expression of P05362 , but not P16070 , was significantly enhanced by the treatment with P01375 ( 100 U/ml ) . We have also investigated possible influence of transforming growth factors , TGF-alpha ( 20 ng/ml ) and TGF-beta ( 2 ng/ml ) , and epidermal growth factor ( 20 ng/ml ) . These factors were not found to modulate P05362 or P16070 expression in vitro . During coculture experiments unstimulated mesothelial cells were almost nonadherent for both resident and elicited peritoneal mononuclear leukocytes for several hours . P01375 or P01133 pretreatment of mesothelial cells greatly enhanced their adhesive affinity to peritoneal mononuclear leukocytes , while TGF-beta pretreatment even reduced the low basal adhesion . Prolonged coculture for 3 weeks resulted in remarkable proliferation and differentiation of both resident and elicited monocytes/macrophages on the mesothelial surface . The stimulation of mesothelial cell culture with P01133 resulted in the macrophage colony-stimulating activity ( M- Q13216 ) production . M- Q13216 was mainly due to P09603 as confirmed with anti P09603 monoclonal antibody ; the residual M- Q13216 was not formed by GM- P04141 . After several passages the mesothelial cells started to produce M- Q13216 spontaneously .
