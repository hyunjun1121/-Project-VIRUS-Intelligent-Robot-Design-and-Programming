DB00087 in allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation . INTRODUCTION : With the use of reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) , early toxicity of allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) has been much reduced . Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) causes morbidities and mortality . DB00087 is a mAb directed against P31358 . When administered prior to transplant , it leads to T-cell depletion . Incorporation of alemtuzumab in RIC results in low rates of GvHD and treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) in haematological diseases , even in the setting of mismatched-donor transplantation . AREAS COVERED : The use of alemtuzumab for GvHD prophylaxis in P09683 . The benefit of alemtuzumab-based conditioning is partially offset by increased disease relapse due to impaired graft-versus-tumor effect ( GvT ) and by slower immune reconstitution , necessitating special precautions . While GvHD is prevented with alemtuzumab , post- P09683 interventions are often required . Most studies find that alemtuzumab-based conditioning results in decreased chronic GvHD and TRM , but also in decreased progression-free survival . Overall survival after 3 - 5 years is usually equivalent and quality of life may be improved because of a lower incidence of sequelae of chronic GvHD . Many aspects of alemtuzumab treatment are under investigation . EXPERT OPINION : DB00087 reduces GvHD and TRM after P09683 . Use of alemtuzumab requires awareness and strict management of the risk of opportunistic infections and of an increased risk of disease recurrence .
