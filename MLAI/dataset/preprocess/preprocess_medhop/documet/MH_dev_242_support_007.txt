Dynamic but not constitutive association of calmodulin with rat Q9H1D0 channels enables fine tuning of Ca2+-dependent inactivation . The Ca(2+)-selective Q9H1D0 as well as the L-type Ca(2+) channel are regulated by the Ca(2+)-binding protein calmodulin ( P62158 ) . Here , we investigated the interaction of P62158 with rat (r) Q9H1D0 in response to alterations of intracellular Ca(2+) , employing Ca(2+)-imaging and patch-clamp techniques . Additionally , confocal FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) microscopy on living cells was utilized as a key method to visualize in vivo protein-protein interactions essential for P62158 regulation of rTRPV6 activity . The effects of overexpressed P62158 or its Ca(2+)-insensitive mutant ( P62158 ( P22033 ) ) was probed on various rTRPV6 mutants and fragments in an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Ca(2+)/ P62158 -dependent regulation and to pinpoint the physiologically relevant rTRPV6- P62158 interaction site . A significant reduction of rTRPV6 activity , as well as an increase in current inactivation , were observed when P62158 was overexpressed in addition to endogenous P62158 . The Ca(2+)-insensitive P62158 ( P22033 ) , however , failed to affect rTRPV6-derived currents . Accordingly , live cell confocal FRET microscopy revealed a robust interaction for P62158 but not P62158 ( P22033 ) with rTRPV6 , suggesting a strict Ca(2+) dependence for their association . Indeed , interaction of rTRPV6 or its C terminus with P62158 increased with rising intracellular Ca(2+) levels , as observed by dynamic FRET measurements . An rTRPV6Delta(695-727) mutant with the very C-terminal end deleted , yielded Ca(2+) currents with a markedly reduced inactivation in accordance with a lack of P62158 interaction as substantiated by FRET microscopy . These results , in contrast with those for P62158 -dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel inactivation , demonstrate a dynamic association of P62158 with the very C-terminal end of rTRPV6 ( aa 695-727 ) , and this enables acceleration of the rate of rTRPV6 current inactivation with increasing intracellular P62158 concentrations .
