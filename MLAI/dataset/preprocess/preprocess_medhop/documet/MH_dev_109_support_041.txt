New anticoagulant strategies . The limitations of standard heparin have prompted the development of a variety of newer antithrombotic agents . In fact , a LMWH preparation has recently been approved for clinical use in North America . Of these novel preparations , LMWH , the direct thrombin inhibitors , and inhibitors of P08514 -IIIa have been used clinically and are in advanced stages of evaluation . Not only is LMWH effective in the prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in high-risk patients , but its more predictable dose response makes it an ideal candidate for the treatment of venous thrombosis . Further studies are needed to determine whether LMWH is superior to standard heparin as adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing coronary thrombolysis or angioplasty . Particularly promising in the setting of arterial thrombosis are hirudin , hirulog , and DB00054 . With the encouraging results reported to date , it is likely that these agents will soon find their way into the treatment armamentarium of arterial thrombosis .
