Functional network reconstruction reveals somatic stemness genetic maps and dedifferentiation-like transcriptome reprogramming induced by P23769 . Somatic stem cell transplantation holds great promise in regenerative medicine . The best-characterized adult stem cells are DB05914 ( MSCs ) , neural stem cells ( NSCs ) , and CD133(+) hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) . The applications of HSCs are hampered since these cells are difficult to maintain in an undifferentiated state in vitro . Understanding genes responsible for stem cell properties and their interactions will help on this issue . The construction of stem cell genetic networks will also help to develop rational strategies to revert somatic cells back to a stem-like state . We performed a systemic study on human CD133(+) HSCs , NSCs , MSCs , and embryonic stem cells and two different progenies of CD133(+) HSCs , microvascular endothelial cells ( MVECs ) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Genes abundant in each or in all three somatic stem cells were identified . We also observed complex genetic networks functioning in postnatal stem cells , in which several genes , such as Q06124 and P00374 , acted as hubs to maintain the stability and connectivity of the whole genetic network . Eighty-seven P19526 genes , including Q15389 and P23769 , were independently identified by comparing P28906 (+) P20138 (-) P28907 (-) hematopoietic stem cells with P28906 (+) precursors and various matured progenies . Introducing P23769 into MVECs resulted in dedifferentiation-like transcriptome reprogramming , with P19526 genes ( such as Q15389 ) being up and endothelial genes ( such as P29323 ) being down . This study provides a foundation for a more detailed understanding of human somatic stem cells . Expressing the newly discovered stem cell genes in matured cells might lead to a global reversion of somatic transcriptome to a stem-like status .
