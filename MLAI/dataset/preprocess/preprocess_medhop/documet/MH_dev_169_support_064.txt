Monoclonal antibody against the platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor prevents coronary artery reocclusion after reperfusion with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in dogs . Localized thrombosis was produced in the left anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery of open chest dogs by constricting a segment so as to produce greater than 90 % stenosis ( reducing blood flow to 40 +/- 10 % of baseline ) , and placing a thrombus in the segment immediately proximal to the stenosis by inducing endothelial cell injury and instilling a mixture of blood and thrombin . Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) at a rate of 15-30 micrograms/kg per min for 30 or 60 min in eight dogs induced coronary artery reperfusion within 23 +/- 7 min ( mean +/- SD ) , but reocclusion occurred despite heparin anticoagulation in all but one of these dogs within 7 +/- 5 min . Intravenous injection of 0.8 mg/kg of the F(ab')2 fragment of a monoclonal antibody ( DB00054 ) directed against the platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor , prevented reocclusion in 10/10 dogs during an observation period of 2 h ( P less than 0.001 vs. rt-PA alone ) . The antibody abolished ADP-induced platelet aggregation and markedly prolonged the bleeding time . Intravenous aspirin or dipyridamole prevented reocclusion for 1 h or more in only 2/7 and 1/6 dogs , respectively . We conclude that the monoclonal antibody is very effective in preventing reocclusion after successful thrombolysis of occluded coronary arteries with rt-PA .
