Treatment of immune-mediated extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease with infliximab . The introduction of infliximab into clinical practice is one of the most significant advances in the care of patients who have Q9UKU7 . DB00065 has become an important part of the medical armamentarium to treat extraintestinal manifestations that often are refractory to other medications and are a significant cause of morbidity in these patients . Two other P01375 inhibitors recently have demonstrated efficacy in CD : certolizumab pegol and adalimumab . The Food and Drug Administration has approved adalimumab for use in RA . One predicts that these agents also may have activity in the extraintestinal manifestation for Q9UKU7 . To determine whether future biologics are effective in the EIM of Q9UKU7 , one may need to look no further than the vast clinical trial experience in primary chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints and skin : RA and psoriasis . For example , the Food and DRug Administration recently has approved an anti-B-cell therapy , rituximab , and a T-cell costimulation modulator , abatacept , for use in RA . It certainly will be of interest to determine whether these biologic agents demonstrate efficacy in the intestinal and EIM of Q9UKU7 .
