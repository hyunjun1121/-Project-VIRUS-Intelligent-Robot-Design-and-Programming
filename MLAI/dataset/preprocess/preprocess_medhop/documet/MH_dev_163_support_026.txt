Effects of alpha/beta- DB01524 immune regulating hormones on bone remodeling and apoptosis in osteoblasts . A large body of evidence suggests that the immune system directly impacts bone physiology . We tested whether immune regulating hormones ( P48061 ) , 17beta- DB01524 ( beta-AED ) , 7beta,17beta-androstenetriol ( beta-AET ) or the 17alpha- DB01524 ( alpha-AED ) , and 7alpha,17beta-androstenetriol ( alpha-AET ) metabolites could directly influence bone remodeling in vitro using human fetal osteoblasts ( FOB-9 ) . The impact on bone remodeling was examined by comparing the ratio of O14788 / O00300 gene expression in response to AED and AET compounds . The alpha-AED was found to significantly increase in the ratio of O14788 / O00300 gene expression and altering the morphology of O14788 stained FOB-9 cells . Cell viability was assessed using a Live/Dead assay . Again alpha-AED was unique in its ability to reduce the proportion of viable cells , and to induce mild apoptosis of FOB-9 cells . Treatment of FOB-9 cells with WY14643 , an activator of Q07869 and -gamma , also significantly elevated the percentage of dead cells . This increase was abolished by co-treatment with GW9962 , a specific inhibitor of P37231 . Analysis of P37231 mRNA by Quantitative RT-PCR and its activation by DNA binding demonstrated that alpha-AED increased P37231 activation by 19 % , while beta-AED conferred a 37 % decrease in P37231 activation . In conclusion , alpha-AED opposed beta-AED by elevating a bone resorption scenario in osteoblast cells . The increase in O14788 / O00300 is modulated by an activation of P37231 that in turn caused mild apoptosis of FOB-9 cells .
