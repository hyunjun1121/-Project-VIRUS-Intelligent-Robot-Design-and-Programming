Phosphodiesterase 4B2 is the predominant phosphodiesterase species and undergoes differential regulation of gene expression in human monocytes and neutrophils . The type 4 phosphodiesterase ( DB05876 ) is the predominant PDE isozyme in various leukocytes and plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory cell activation . There are four DB05876 subtypes ( A , B , C , and D ) , and within each subtype , there are multiple variants . Very recently , we found in monocytes that Q07343 gene expression is selectively induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and that the induction is inhibited by interleukin ( IL ) -10 and P05112 . In this study , we show that the Q07343 gene is constitutively expressed in neutrophils and that this expression remains unaffected by LPS or P22301 . Q07343 is the predominant subtype in neutrophils and in unstimulated or LPS-stimulated monocytes , and in these cells , the PDE4B2 variant is the only detectable molecular species of Q07343 . Therefore , PDE4B2 is the predominant PDE isoform in human neutrophils and monocytes , and its expression is regulated differently by these two cell types . Furthermore , leukocytes are the most dominant source of PDE4B2 , suggesting that PDE4B2 is a relatively specific target for discovering anti-inflammatory drugs .
