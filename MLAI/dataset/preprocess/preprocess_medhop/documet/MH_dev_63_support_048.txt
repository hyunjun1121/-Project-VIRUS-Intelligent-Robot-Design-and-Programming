P29474 activation by HDL is impaired in genetic P11597 deficiency . Mutations in the P11597 gene resulting in defective P11597 activity have been shown to cause remarkable elevations of plasma HDL-C levels , with the accumulation in plasma of large , buoyant HDL particles enriched in apolipoprotein E. Genetic P11597 deficiency thus represents a unique tool to evaluate how structural alterations of HDL impact on HDL atheroprotective functions . Aim of the present study was to assess the ability of HDL obtained from P11597 -deficient subjects to protect endothelial cells from the development of endothelial dysfunction . HDL isolated from one homozygous and seven heterozygous carriers of P11597 null mutations were evaluated for their ability to down-regulate cytokine-induced cell adhesion molecule expression and to promote NO production in cultured endothelial cells . When compared at the same protein concentration , HDL and HDL3 from carriers proved to be as effective as control HDL and HDL3 in down-regulating cytokine-induced P19320 , while carrier HDL2 were more effective than control HDL2 in inhibiting P19320 expression . On the other hand , HDL and HDL fractions from carriers of P11597 deficiency were significantly less effective than control HDL and HDL fractions in stimulating NO production , due to a reduced P29474 activating capacity , likely because of a reduced Q14703 content . In conclusion , the present findings support the notion that genetic P11597 deficiency , by affecting HDL particle structure , impacts on HDL vasculoprotective functions . Understanding of these effects might be important for predicting the outcomes of pharmacological P11597 inhibition .
