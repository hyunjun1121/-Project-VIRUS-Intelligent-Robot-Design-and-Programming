Gambogic acid inhibits angiogenesis through suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of P35968 /Flk-1 . Previous studies revealed that gambogic acid ( GA ) , the major active ingredient of gamboge , a brownish to orange resin exuded from Garcinia hanburryi tree in Southeast Asia , possessed significant anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo . In this study , we explored the high antiangiogenic activities of GA for the first time . GA inhibits the P15692 -stimulated proliferation , migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) as well as microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings in vitro . Moreover , GA inhibits vessel growth in matrigel plugs and P62158 in vivo and transplanted tumor in mice . The results also indicated that GA decreases P15692 production of cultured tumor cells and inhibits P15692 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of P35968 /Flk-1 . This inhibition of receptor phosphorylation is correlated with a significant decrease in P15692 -triggered phosphorylated forms of P29323 , AKT and p38 . Taken together , these findings strongly suggest that GA might be a structurally novel angiogenesis inhibitor .
