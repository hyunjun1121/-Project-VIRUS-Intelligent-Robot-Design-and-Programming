Hyperecho-turbo spin-echo sequences at 3T : clinical application in neuroradiology . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Hyperecho-turbo spin-echo ( hyperTSE ) sequences were developed to reduce the specific absorption rate ( SAR ) , especially at high fields such as 3T and above . The purpose of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the detection of neuroradiologic pathologies by hyperTSE in comparison with standard turbo spin-echo ( TSE180 degrees ) sequences . MATERIALS AND METHODS : TSE180 degrees and hyperTSE images with parameters adapted for equal P24752 contrast were acquired on a 3T whole-body system in 51 patients with 54 cerebral pathologies . Region-of-interest analysis was performed of signal intensities of pathologies , normal white and gray matter , P04141 , and the SD of noise . Signal intensity-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) and contrast-to-noise ratios ( CNRs ) for healthy tissues and pathologies were determined . A qualitative rating concerning artifacts , lesion conspicuity , and image quality was performed by 2 experienced neuroradiologists . RESULTS : HyperTSE sequences were equivalent to standard TSE180 degrees sequences for the P21554 of pathologies and of the contrast between gray and white matter . The SNR of gray and white matter and P04141 were also the same . The CNRs of the pathologies in hyperTSE and TSE180 degrees images were strongly correlated with each other ( r = 0.93 , P = .001 ) . The visual rating of images revealed no significant differences between hyperTSE and TSE180 degrees . CONCLUSION : HyperTSE sequences proved to be qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent to TSE180 degrees sequences in the detection of high- and low-signal-intensity lesions . They provide equal P21554 of pathologies and of gray minus white matter and reduce the imaging restrictions of conventional TSE180 degrees imposed by SAR limitations at 3T .
