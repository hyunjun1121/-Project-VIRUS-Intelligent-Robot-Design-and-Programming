Systems pharmacology assessment of the 5-fluorouracil pathway . AIM : To assess the impact of the 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) drug-pathway genes on cytotoxicity , and determine whether loss-of-function analyses coupled with functional assays can help prioritize pharmacogenomic candidate genes . MATERIALS & METHODS : Dose-response experiments were used to quantify the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 following the specific knockdown of genes selected from the DB00544 PharmGKB drug pathway in three human colorectal cell lines . Changes in sensitivity were considered significant if the IC(50) for shRNA-exposed cells were three standard deviations outside the mean IC(50) for control-treated cells . RESULTS : Of the 24 genes analyzed , 13 produced significant changes on the phenotype of sensitivity to DB00544 ( P00374 , Q14117 , P23919 , P33316 , Q05932 , Q92820 , P15531 , Q8TCD5 , P23921 , P04818 , Q9BZX2 , P13051 and P11172 ) . CONCLUSION : The RNAi screening strategy enabled prioritization of the genes from the DB00544 drug pathway . Further validation of the genes credentialed in this study should include gene activity or expression and mutation analyses of clinical samples .
