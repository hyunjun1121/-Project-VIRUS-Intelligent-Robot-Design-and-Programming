DB00013 plasminogen activator is a central regulator of macrophage three-dimensional invasion , matrix degradation , and adhesion . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) coordinate a plasmin-mediated proteolytic cascade that has been implicated in cell adhesion , cell motility , and matrix breakdown , for example , during inflammation . As part of their function during inflammatory responses , macrophages move through tissues and encounter both two-dimensional ( 2D ) surfaces and more complex three-dimensional ( 3D ) interstitial matrices . Based on approaches employing uPA gene-deficient macrophages , plasminogen supplementation , and neutralization with specific protease inhibitors , it is reported in this study that uPA activity is a central component of the invasion of macrophages through a 3D Matrigel barrier ; it also has a nonredundant role in macrophage-mediated matrix degradation . For murine macrophages , matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was found to be required for these uPA-mediated effects . Evidence for a unique role for uPA in the inverse relationship between macrophage adhesion and 2D migration was also noted : macrophage adhesion to vitronectin was enhanced by uPA and blocked by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , the latter approach also able to enhance in turn the 2D migration on this matrix protein . It is therefore proposed that uPA can have a key role in the inflammatory response at several levels as a central regulator of macrophage 3D invasion , matrix remodeling , and adhesion .
