Modulation of cytokine release from human monocytes by drugs used in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases . BACKGROUND : Cytokines produced in the gut mucosa play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases ( Q9UKU7 ) . To determine whether drugs used in the treatment of these diseases modulate cytokine synthesis , we investigated their effects on endotoxin-induced tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta and P05231 release by elutriation-purified human monocytes in vitro . METHODS : Drugs tested were dexamethasone , DB00244 , sulphapyridine and zileuton ( a P09917 inhibitor ) . Monocytes were isolated and stimulated with endotoxin , and P01375 , IL-1 and P05231 levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . RESULTS : Monocyte stimulation with endotoxin resulted in an average P01375 release of 2464 +/- 64 pg/10(6) cells , IL-1 release of 616 +/- 47 pg/10(6) cells and P05231 release of 2259 +/- 148 pg/10(6) cells . Addition of dexamethasone resulted in a reduction of P01375 , IL-1 and P05231 release to below background levels . DB00891 significantly reduced P01375 and induced IL-1 release in a dose-dependent fashion , but had no significant effect on P05231 release . 5- DB00233 did not modulate P05231 synthesis , but significantly reduced IL-1 and enhanced P01375 synthesis . Zileuton reduced P01375 and P05231 release , but enhanced IL-1 release . CONCLUSION : We conclude that these anti-inflammatory drugs are able to modulate cytokine release by human monocytes . Further studies are needed to determine whether these effects are related to their therapeutic efficacy in Q9UKU7 .
