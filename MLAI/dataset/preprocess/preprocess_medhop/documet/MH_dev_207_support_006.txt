Characterization of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs based on a sensitive cellular luciferase reporter gene assay . A novel cellular assay for the functional characterization of agonistic and antagonistic analogs of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) was developed . This assay is based on a fusion of the c-fos immediate-early gene promoter to Photinus pyralis luciferase ( Luc ) as a reporter gene , stably transfected in a recombinant cell line expressing the human P30968 . Transcription of endogenous c-fos and fos-Luc fusion gene are transiently induced quite similar by fetal calf serum or the superagonistic analog [ D-Trp6 ] DB00644 in a selected cell line . The reporter gene was therefore used to monitor agonist-induced signaling via the human P30968 . Whereas Luc activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner by DB00644 or [ D-Trp6 ] DB00644 , different antagonistic peptides completely inhibited this stimulation . The antagonistic potency ( IC50 ) of various peptides with DB00050 and Antarelix as lead compounds in general correlated well with the binding affinity ( KD ) as determined from ligand binding experiments . The specificity of an inhibitory effect was confirmed by P30968 -independent stimulation with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or basic fibroblast growth factor . Since this new reporter gene assay is sensitive and simple and can be performed in a microtiter plate , it will significantly facilitate screening and functional characterization of DB00644 analogs .
