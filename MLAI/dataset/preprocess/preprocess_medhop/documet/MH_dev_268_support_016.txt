Computational modeling of the direct hydride transfer mechanism for the MAO catalyzed oxidation of phenethylamine and benzylamine : ONIOM ( QM/QM ) calculations . Monoamine oxidases are two isozymic flavoenzymes which are the important targets for drugs used in the treatment of depression , Parkinson and Alzheimer 's diseases . The catalytic reaction taking place between the cofactor DB03147 and amine substrate is still not completely understood . Herein we employed quantum chemical methods on the recently proposed direct hydride transfer mechanism including full active site residues of MAO isoforms in the calculations . Activation free energy barriers of direct hydride transfer mechanism for P21397 and P27338 were calculated by ONIOM ( our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital + molecular mechanics ) method with QM/QM ( quantum mechanics:quantum mechanics ) approach employing several density functional theory functionals , B3LYP , WB97XD , P62158 -B3LYP and M06-2X , for the high layer . The formation of very recently proposed Î±C-flavin N5 adduct inside the enzyme has been investigated . ONIOM ( M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p):PM6 ) results revealed that such an adduct may form only in P27338 suggesting slightly different hydride transfer mechanisms for P21397 and P27338 .
