P26718 -mediated immunity underlying paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and related bone marrow failure syndromes . It is considered that a similar immune mechanism acts in the pathogenesis of bone marrow ( BM ) failure in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria ( PNH ) and its related disorders , such as aplastic anaemia ( AA ) and myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) . However , the molecular events in immune-mediated marrow injury have not been elucidated . We recently reported an abnormal expression of stress-inducible P26718 ( natural-killer group 2 , member D ) ligands , such as ULBP ( UL16-binding protein ) and Q29983 /B ( major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecules A/B ) , on granulocytes in some PNH patients and the granulocyte killing by autologous lymphocytes in vitro . The present study found that the expression of P26718 ligands was common to both granulocytes and BM cells of patients with PNH , AA , and P43034 , indicating their exposure to some incitement to induce the ligands . The haematopoietic colony formation in vitro by the patients ' marrow cells significantly improved when their BM cells were pretreated with antibodies against P26718 receptor , suggesting that the antibodies rescued haematopoietic cells expressing P26718 ligands from damage by autologous lymphocytes with P26718 . Clinical courses of patients with PNH and AA showed a close association of the expression of P26718 ligands with BM failure and a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy . We therefore propose that P26718 -mediated immunity may underlie the BM failure in PNH and its-related marrow diseases .
