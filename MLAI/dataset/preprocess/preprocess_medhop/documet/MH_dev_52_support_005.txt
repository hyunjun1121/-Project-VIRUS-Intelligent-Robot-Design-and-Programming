Lack of association between Q9HAW7 , O60656 , ARP , P00995 and P13569 gene polymorphisms and pancreatic cancer in Italian patients . AIM : To investigate simultaneously Q9HAW7 , O60656 , ARP , SPINK and P13569 genes to verify whether genetic polymorphisms predispose to the development of pancreatic cancer ( PC ) . METHODS : Genomic DNA of 61 pancreatic cancer patients and 105 healthy controls ( HC ) were analyzed . Q9HAW7 genotyping was determined by PCR-RFLP analysis . Specific PCR and sequencing were used to analyze genetic variants of O60656 , ARP , P00995 and P13569 genes . RESULTS : Four different alleles ( *1 : WT ; *2 : N129K and R131K ; *3 : N129K , R131K , and W208R ; and *4 : W208R ) in Q9HAW7 and three different alleles ( *1 : WT ; *4 : Y242X ; and *5 : D256N ) in O60656 were detected . All P22309 polymorphisms were observed at similar frequency in PC patients and HC . Seven different alleles in ARP were found in PC patients and HC at similar frequency . The P00995 mutations N34S and P55S occurred in five PC patients with a prevalence ( 4.1 % ) not significantly different from that observed ( 2.0 % ) in HC . The only P13569 DeltaF508 mutation was recognized in three PC patients with a prevalence ( 4.9 % ) similar to HC . CONCLUSION : Q9HAW7 , O60656 , ARP , P00995 and P13569 gene polymorphisms are not associated with PC in Italian patients .
