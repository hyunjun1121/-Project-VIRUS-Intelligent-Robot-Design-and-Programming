Comparative effects of cytokines on constitutive and inducible expression of the gene encoding for the cytochrome P450 3A6 isoenzyme in cultured rabbit hepatocytes : consequences on progesterone 6beta-hydroxylation . Cultured rabbit hepatocytes were used to compare the relative activities of cytokines to inhibit the constitutive or rifampicin ( Q9HBH0 ) -induced expression of the cytochrome P450 3A6 gene ( CYP3A6 ) . Human recombinant cytokines tested were interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) ( 2 U/mL ) , interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) ( 5,000 U/mL ) and interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) ( 50 U/mL ) . Hepatocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of 25 microM Q9HBH0 for 24 hr , with or without cytokines alone or in combination . All these cytokines inhibited Q9HBH0 -induced P4503A6 expression without apparent cellular toxicity . By contrast , only P01579 treatment provided a significant decrease ( 41 % ) in the constitutive P4503A6 protein level . Moreover , cytokines differed in their ability to repress Q9HBH0 -dependent transcriptional induction of CYP3A6 : IL-1beta and P60568 were approximately equipotent , causing an almost 40-50 % suppression of CYP3A6 mRNA and protein levels , whereas P01579 exerted repressive effects only on P4503A6-related erythromycin N-demethylase activity and inducible protein expression . In fact , although strongly reducing P4503A6 protein content ( an approximate 70 % decrease ) , P01579 did not exhibit any influence on CYP3A6 mRNAs with the exception of its association with interleukins . All these results suggest that IL-1beta and P60568 mainly promote a transcriptional repression mechanism , given the absence of effect of these cytokines on the basal P4503A6 level , whereas P01579 exerts a post-transcriptional suppressive action on both induced and constitutive P4503A6 expression . Consequently , P4503A6-dependent progesterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity also presented a cytokine-specific pattern of inhibition , with a much greater sensitivity than P4503A6 immunoreactive protein to IL-1beta and P60568 + P01579 treatments . Thus , this study underlines the significant impact of inflammation on steroid metabolism .
