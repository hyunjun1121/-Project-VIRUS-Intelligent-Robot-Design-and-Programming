DB01268 synergizes the antitumor effect of cisplatin via modulation of P07992 expression in models of gastric cancer . We evaluated the effects of sunitinib monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin in human gastric cancer cell lines . DB01268 showed antiproliferative effect in gastric cancer cells line with high P16234 expression . Knockdown of P16234 showed that sunitinib sensitivity was correlated with the basal expression of P16234 . Synergistic growth inhibitory activity in combination with cisplatin was identified . We further explored how sunitinib potentiated the activity of cisplatin . We found that sunitinib treatment resulted in the down-regulation of P07992 expression via the modulation of P16234 expression in gastric cancer cells . The effect was verified via SNU484 xenograft model . Our data support the rationale of clinical trial using sunitinib in combination of cisplatin in gastric cancer .
