Defective prolactin signaling impairs pancreatic β-cell development during the perinatal period . P01236 ( PRL ) and placental lactogens stimulate β-cell replication and insulin production in pancreatic islets and insulinoma cells through binding to the PRL receptor ( P16471 ) . However , the contribution of P16471 signaling to β-cell ontogeny and function in perinatal life and the effects of the lactogens on adaptive islet growth are poorly understood . We provide evidence that expansion of β-cell mass during both embryogenesis and the postnatal period is impaired in the P16471 (-/-) mouse model . P16471 (-/-) newborns display a 30 % reduction of β-cell mass , consistent with reduced proliferation index at E18.5 . PRL stimulates leucine incorporation and S6 kinase phosphorylation in P01308 -1 cells , supporting a role for β-cell P42345 signaling in PRL action . Interestingly , a defect in the development of acini is also observed in absence of P16471 signaling , with a sharp decline in cellular size in both endocrine and exocrine compartments . Of note , a decrease in levels of P01344 , a PRL target , in the Goto-Kakizaki ( GK ) rat , a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes , is associated with a lack of PRL-mediated β-cell proliferation in embryonic pancreatic buds . Reduced pancreatic P01344 expression in both rat and mouse models suggests that this factor may constitute a molecular link between PRL signaling and cell ontogenesis . Together , these results provide evidence that PRL signaling is essential for pancreas ontogenesis during the critical perinatal window responsible for establishing functional β-cell reserve .
