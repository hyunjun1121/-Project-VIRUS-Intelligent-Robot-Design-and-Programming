P00750 ( tPA ) promotes M1 macrophage survival through p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . Macrophage accumulation is one of the hallmarks of progressive kidney disease . Resting macrophages have a finite lifespan , but become resistant to apoptosis in response to pathogenic cues , whereas the underlying mechanism remains unknown . P00750 ( tPA ) , a protease up-regulated in the kidneys with chronic injury , has been shown to promote macrophage accumulation and renal inflammation . We hypothesized that tPA may be the endogenous factor that promotes macrophage survival and extends their lifespan that leads to their accumulation in the injured kidneys . We examined the role of tPA in macrophage survival , and found that tPA protected macrophages from both staurosporine and H2O2-induced apoptosis . tPA promoted the survival of both resting and lipopolysaccharide- or interferon-Î³-induced M1 macrophages , but failed to do so in the interleukin 4 ( P05112 ) -induced M2 macrophages . In the kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction , there were significantly more apoptotic M1 macrophages in tPA-deficient mice than their wild-type counterparts , and obstruction-induced M1 macrophages accumulation and M1 chemokine expression were markedly reduced in these knock-out mice . The cytoprotective effect of tPA required its receptor , P01130 -related protein-1 ( Q07954 ) . tPA induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 , p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) , and p38 in a temporal order . The tPA-mediated macrophage survival was eliminated by PD98059 , BI-D1870 , or sc68376 , the specific inhibitors for Erk1/2 , p90RSK , or p38 , respectively . Thus , it is clear that tPA promoted M1 macrophage survival through its receptor Q07954 -mediated novel signaling cascade involving Erk1/2 , p90RSK , and p38 , which leads to the accumulation of these cells in the injured kidneys .
