The influence of metabolic gene polymorphisms on urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in Chinese coke oven workers . Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-OHP ) , a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) exposure , may be influenced by metabolic gene polymorphisms . Such knowledge could benefit us in understanding the inter-individual difference in the mechanism of PAHs-induced carcinogenesis . We investigated the influence of gene polymorphisms on urinary 1-OHP concentrations in 447 coke oven workers from two coking plants in south China . After adjustment for age , plant , level of occupational exposure , body mass index , level of education , alcohol consumption , cigarette smoking and respirator usage , P35869 R554K ( rs2066853 ) , P22309 -3263T > G ( rs4124874 ) and P09211 I105V ( rs1695 ) were associated with urinary 1-OHP excretion with the p-value of 0.053 , 0.006 and 0.021 , respectively . The concentrations of urinary 1-OHP ( Geometric mean , micromol/mol creatinine ) in the homozygous major variant carriers and homozygous minor variant carriers for P35869 R554K , P22309 -3263T > G and P09211 I105V were listed as follows : 4.20 and 5.12 , 5.11 and 3.92 , 4.93 and 2.91 , respectively . P30711 present carriers had a significantly higher urinary 1-OHP level than that in null carriers in the case with P35869 R554K GA/AA carriers ( 5.17 vs. 3.64 micromol/mol creatinine , p=0.038 ) , as well as in the case with P22309 -3263T > G TG/GG carriers ( 5.67 vs. 3.38 micromol/mol creatinine , p=0.001 ) . These results showed that P35869 , P22309 , P09211 and P30711 polymorphisms were associated with urinary 1-OHP concentrations in Chinese coke oven workers . No influence was found in the association between urinary 1-OHP and other genetic polymorphisms such as P04798 , P05177 , Q16678 , P05181 , P07099 , P34913 in this population .
