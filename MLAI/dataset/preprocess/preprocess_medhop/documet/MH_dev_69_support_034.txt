P35462 stimulation underlies the development of DB01235 -induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson 's disease . Development of DB01235 -induced dyskinesia ( LID ) remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Sensitization to DB01235 correlates with ectopic expression of D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum , implicating D3 receptors in development of LID . We demonstrate that the selective D3 antagonist S33084 abolishes development of LID over 30 days in MPTP-lesioned marmosets without effecting the anti-parkinsonian actions of DB01235 . Furthermore , following a 14 day washout , when challenged with DB01235 in the absence of S33084 , these animals continued to exhibit reduced LID . In the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat , S33084 similarly attenuated development of behavioural sensitization to DB01235 . Additionally , DB01235 -induced elevations in striatal pre-proenkephalin-A ( PPE-A ) ( but not PPE-B , phospho[ DB00156 (34)] Q9UD71 , D1 , and D2 receptor mRNA or D3 receptor levels ) were reduced in S33084 treated animals . Our data suggest a role for D3 receptors in the development of LID and suggest that initiating DB01235 treatment with a D3 antagonist may reduce the development of LID in PD .
