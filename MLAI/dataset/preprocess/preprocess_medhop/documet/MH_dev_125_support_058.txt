MicroRNA-384-5p regulates ischemia-induced cardioprotection by targeting phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit delta ( PI3K p110Î´ ) . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are a novel class of powerful , endogenous regulators of gene expression . This study identified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs in ischemic myocardium of rats using TaqMan Low Density Array . In addition , bioinformatics analyses , such as Gene ontology and Pathway assays , were applied to determine the apoptosis pathway , only regulated by miR-384-5p , and all the associated target genes ( O00329 , Q08209 , P16298 , P63098 , P42574 and P01583 ) . These target genes , besides P42338 , were shown to be significantly up-regulated by qRT-PCR assay , which further suggested that O00329 , Q08209 , P63098 , P42574 , P01583 could be regulated by miR-384-5p . MTT , Western blot , qRT-PCR and luciferase assays were used to investigate the role of miR-384-5p in myocardial ischemia . We found that cleaved caspase3 expression was up-regulated by miR-384-5p and down-regulated by miR-384-5p inhibitor suggesting that apoptosis pathway was regulated by miR-384-5p . We also found that miR-384-5p suppressed cell viability while miR-384-5p inhibitor improved it , confirming H9c2 cell survival was affected by miR-384-5p . In addition , the O00329 protein level in H9c2 cells was up-regulated by miR-384-5p inhibitor . We found that miR-384-5p expression level decreased and O00329 protein level increased in both ischemic myocardium of rats and hypoxic H9c2 cells , and that miR-384-5p suppress O00329 expression through a miR-384-5p binding site within the 3' untranslational region of O00329 . These results show that miR-384-5p , an important protecting factor , plays a significant role in cardioprotection by regulating O00329 in myocardial ischemia .
