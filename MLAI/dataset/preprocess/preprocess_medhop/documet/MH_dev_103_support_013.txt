P27487 deficiency preserves cardiac function via P0C6A0 signaling in rats subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( P27487 ) enzyme inhibition has been reported to increase plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) level for controlling postprandial glucose concentration . Both P27487 inhibitors and P0C6A0 analog have been approved for antihyperglycemic agents . In addition to the insulinotropic effect , P0C6A0 signaling was reported to modulate cardiac function . P27487 inhibition was shown to improve survival rate after myocardial infarction in mice , but the precise mechanism remains unknown . We aimed to compare the cardiovascular responses of ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) between wild-type and P27487 -deficient rats and investigate the underlying mechanism . Rats were subjected to 45 min of coronary artery occlusion , followed by reperfusion for 2 h . Cardiac function was characterized by analyzing pressure-volume loops . As compared to wild-type rats , after I/R , P27487 -deficient rats had better cardiac performance in association with less infarct size and cardiac injury markers ( LDH , P01160 , and DB04899 ) , which could be attenuated by exendin-(9-39) , a P43220 antagonist . Exendin-(9-39) could diminish the increased phosphorylation levels of myocardial AKT and GSK-3Î² as well as the higher expression of P14672 in post-infarcted P27487 -deficient rats . However , exendin-(9-39) could not completely abrogate the less infarct size in P27487 -deficient rats as compared with that in wild-type rats , implicating the involvement of P43220 -independent pathway . In summary , this study demonstrated that the benefit of cardiac protective action against I/R injury was demonstrated in P27487 -deficient rats , which is mediated through both P43220 -dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms .
