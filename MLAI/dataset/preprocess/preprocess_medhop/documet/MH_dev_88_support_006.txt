Management of endocrine disease : GH excess : diagnosis and medical therapy . Acromegaly is predominantly caused by a pituitary adenoma , which secretes an excess of GH resulting in increased IGF1 levels . Most of the GH assays used currently measure only the levels of the 22 kDa form of GH . In theory , the diagnostic sensitivity may be lower compared with the previous assays , which have used polyclonal antibodies . Many GH-secreting adenomas are plurihormonal and may co-secrete prolactin , DB00024 and Î±-subunit . Hyperprolactinaemia is found in 30-40 % of patients with acromegaly , and hyperprolactinaemia may occasionally be diagnosed before acromegaly is apparent . Although trans-sphenoidal surgery of a GH-secreting adenoma remains the first treatment at most centres , the role of somatostatin analogues , octreotide long-acting repeatable and lanreotide Autogel as primary therapy is still the subject of some debate . Although the normalisation of GH and IGF1 levels is the main objective in all patients with acromegaly , GH and IGF1 levels may be discordant , especially during somatostatin analogue therapy . This discordance usually takes the form of high GH levels and an IGF1 level towards the upper limit of the normal range . DB06663 , a new somatostatin analogue , may be more efficacious in some patients , but the drug has not yet been registered for acromegaly . Papers published on pasireotide have reported an increased risk of diabetes mellitus due to a reduction in insulin levels . DB00082 , the P10912 antagonist , is indicated - alone or in combination with a somatostatin analogue - in most patients who fail to enter remission on a somatostatin analogue . Dopamine-D2-agonists may be effective as monotherapy in a few patients , but it may prove necessary to apply combination therapy involving a somatostatin analogue and/or pegvisomant .
