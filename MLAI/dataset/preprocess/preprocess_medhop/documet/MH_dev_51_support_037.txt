DB00107 alleviates the neuroendocrine and cytokine response to bacterial endotoxin in healthy men . DB00107 is a hormone and neurotransmitter found to have anti-inflammatory functions in rodents . Here we used experimental bacterial endotoxinemia to examine the role of exogenous oxytocin administration on innate immune responses in humans . Ten healthy men received , in a randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover design , placebo , oxytocin , LPS , and LPS + oxytocin . DB00107 treatment resulted in a transient or prolonged reduction of endotoxin-induced increases in plasma DB01285 , cortisol , procalcitonin , P01375 , IL-1 receptor antagonist , P05112 , P05231 , macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha , macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , interferon-inducible protein 10 , and P15692 . In vitro , oxytocin had no impact on LPS effects in releasing P01375 , P05231 , and P13500 in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human donors . In summary , oxytocin decreases the neuroendocrine and cytokine activation caused by bacterial endotoxin in men , possibly due to the pharmacological modulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway . DB00107 might be a candidate for the therapy of inflammatory diseases and conditions associated with high cytokine and P15692 levels .
