DB08860 inactivates NF-kappaB and decreases P05231 production through Rho kinase pathway in MCF-7 cells . The aim of the present study was to provide new mechanistic insight into the effect of pitavastatin at low dose on NF-kappaB activated by P01375 in the human breast cancer cell line ( MCF-7 ) . We found that treatment of MCF-7 with 1 microM pitavastatin inhibited the proliferation and suppressed the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB p65 induced by P01375 with Western blotting . Furthermore , EMSA showed that pitavastatin significantly reduced the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB induced by P01375 . Subsequently , luciferase assay revealed that pitavastatin ( 1 microM ) inhibited the transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB promoter , which was clearly related to the P04035 activity because addition of mevalonic acid ( MEV ) could elevate the NF-kappaB activity . Moreover , the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 abolished the effect of pitavastatin on NF-kappaB activity . Finally , the addition of P01375 significantly increased P05231 protein production , which was suppressed by the addition of pitavastatin . These results suggest that pitavastatin at low dose ( 1 microM ) inhibits NF-kappaB activation and decreases P05231 production induced by P01375 . It is dependent on Rho kinase pathway in human breast cancer cells .
