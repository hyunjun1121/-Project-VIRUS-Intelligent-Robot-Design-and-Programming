A tandem repeat of a fragment of Listeria monocytogenes internalin B protein induces cell survival and proliferation . P14210 ( P14210 ) is critical for tissue homeostasis and repair in many organs including the lung , heart , kidney , liver , nervous system , and skin . P14210 is a heterodimeric protein containing 20 disulfide bonds distributed among an amino-terminal hairpin , four kringle domains , and a serine protease-like domain . Due to its complex structure , recombinant production of P14210 in prokaryotes requires denaturation and refolding , processes that are impractical for large-scale manufacture . Thus , pharmaceutical quantities of P14210 are not available despite its potential applications . A fragment of the Listeria monocytogenes internalin B protein from amino acids 36-321 ( InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ ) was demonstrated to bind to and partially activate the P08581 DB00134 . InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ has a stable β-sheet structure and is easily produced in its native conformation by Escherichia coli . We cloned InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ ( 1×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ ) and engineered a head-to-tail repeat of InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ with a linker peptide ( 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ ) ; 1×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ and 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ were purified from E. coli . Both 1× and 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ activated the DB00134 tyrosine kinase . We subsequently compared signal transduction of the two proteins in primary lung endothelial cells . 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ activated P27361 /2 , P40763 , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways , whereas 1×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ activated only P40763 and P27361 /2 . The 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ promoted improved motility compared with 1×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ and additionally stimulated proliferation equivalent to full-length P14210 . Both the 1× and 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ prevented apoptosis by the profibrotic peptide angiotensin II in cell culture and ex vivo lung slice cultures . The ease of large-scale production and capacity of 2×InlB₃₆₋₃₂₁ to mimic P14210 make it a potential candidate as a pharmaceutical agent for tissue repair .
