Rubella vaccine-induced cellular immunity : evidence of associations with polymorphisms in the Toll-like , vitamin A and D receptors , and innate immune response genes . Toll-like , vitamin A and D receptors and other innate proteins participate in various immune functions . We determined whether innate gene-sequence variations are associated with rubella vaccine-induced cytokine immune responses . We genotyped 714 healthy children ( 11-19 years of age ) after two doses of rubella-containing vaccine for 148 candidate SNP markers . Rubella virus-induced cytokines were measured by ELISA . Twenty-two significant associations ( range of P values 0.002-0.048 ) were found between SNPs in the vitamin A receptor family ( P10276 , P10826 , Q02880 and P13631 ) , vitamin D receptor and downstream mediator of vitamin D signaling ( P19793 ) genes and rubella virus-specific ( P01579 , P60568 , P22301 , P01375 , and GM- P04141 ) cytokine immune responses . A O15455 gene promoter region SNP ( rs5743305 , -8441A > T ) was associated with rubella-specific GM- P04141 secretion . Importantly , SNPs in the Q9C035 gene coding regions , rs3740996 ( His43Tyr ) and rs10838525 ( Gln136Arg ) , were associated with an allele dose-related secretion of rubella virus-specific P01375 and P60568 /GM- P04141 , respectively , and have been previously shown to have functional consequences regarding the antiviral activity and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection . We identified associations between individual SNPs and haplotypes in , or involving , the O95786 ( O95786 ) gene and rubella-specific P01375 secretion . This is the first paper to present evidence that polymorphisms in the TLR , vitamin A , vitamin D receptor , and innate immunity genes can influence adaptive cytokine responses to rubella vaccination .
