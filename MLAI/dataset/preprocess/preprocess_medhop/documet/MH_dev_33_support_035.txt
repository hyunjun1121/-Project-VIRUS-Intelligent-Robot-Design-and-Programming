[ Cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection following cord blood stem cell transplantation ] . We describe a 4-year-old-girl with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( FHL ) who developed disseminated cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial ( Q9P121 ) infection after unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation ( uCBSCT ) . After transplantation , the patient developed steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease , and was given methylprednisolone , cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil . Six months after uCBSCT , cutaneous lesions that looked like insect bites appeared and spread widely over the thighs . Q9P121 infection was diagnosed by skin biopsy although no organism could be identified . DB01017 ( MINO ) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim ( ST ) were administered . However , the cutaneous disease followed a course of remissions and exacerbations . One month after the skin biopsy , mycobacterium chelonae was detected by bacteriological culture of abscess drainage . Ten months after uCBSCT , the cutaneous lesions quickly progressed and the inguinal lymph nodes became enlarged and painful . Then the antibiotics were switched from MINO and ST to amikacin and clarithromycin ( P62158 ) based on the results of mycobacterial susceptibility test . The cutaneous lesions gradually improved after continuous administration of P62158 . Cutaneous Q9P121 infection is rare , but it may occur in immunocompromised patients after P09683 .
