Genetic analysis of 56 polymorphisms in 17 genes involved in methionine metabolism in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm . BACKGROUND : Previous studies suggested an association between abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) and hyperhomocysteinaemia , a complex trait determined by genetic and environmental factors . Our hypothesis was that polymorphisms in genes directly or indirectly involved in methionine metabolism may contribute to AAA susceptibility . METHOD : We studied 56 polymorphisms in P42898 , Q99707 , Q9UBK8 , P35520 , P11586 , P41440 , P40261 , P20062 , P23526 , Q93088 , Q9H2M3 , Q04609 , P04818 , Q7L5Y1 , P34896 , P27169 , Q15165 genes according to their demonstrated/putative function , localisation in promoter or regulatory and coding regions and/or heterozygosity values > 0.300 . Polymorphisms were evaluated by using a primer extension based microarray technology in 423 AAA patients and 423 matched controls . RESULTS : All polymorphisms resulted in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls . At the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors ( sex , age , hypertension , smoking habit , dyslipidaemia , diabetes ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , rs8003379 P11586 ( odds ratio ( OR ) 0.41 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.26 to 0.65 ) and rs326118 Q9UBK8 ( OR 0.47 , 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.77 ) polymorphisms resulted in independent susceptibility factor for AAA . CONCLUSIONS : After haplotype reconstruction , logistic regression analyses adjusted for traditional risk factors and P48444 showed a significant association among AAA and P23526 , Q04609 , P11586 , Q99707 , P40261 , P27169 and P04818 haplotypes . Our findings offer new insights into the pathogenesis of AAA .
