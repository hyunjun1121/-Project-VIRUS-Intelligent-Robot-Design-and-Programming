Regulation of P27361 /2 phosphorylation by acute and chronic morphine - implications for the role of DB02527 -responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) -dependent and Ets-like protein-1 ( Elk-1 ) -dependent transcription ; small interfering RNA-based strategy . Extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) have been shown to be activated by opioids and functionally linked to addiction . Morphine-associated changes in P29323 activity seem to be the characteristic features of opioid action . In this study , we observed a rapid and severe increase in P27361 /2 activity after a 5 min morphine treatment of P29320 -MOR cells ( transfected with the rat mu-opioid receptor P35372 ) expressing mu-opioid receptor . Cellular adaptations to chronic ( 72 h ) morphine treatment were manifested by a slight and sustained increase in P27361 /2 activity . Withdrawal caused by an opioid receptor antagonist - naloxone - attenuated phosphorylation of P27361 /2 . Little information is available on the precise mechanism of P29323 activity regulation . Using RNA interference technology , we generated stably transfected cells with silenced expression of DB02527 -responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) and Ets-like protein-1 ( Elk-1 ) transcription factors , which are known targets for activated P27361 /2 . In these cells , P27361 /2 activity regulation was altered . Silencing of CREB or Elk-1 significantly increased P29323 activation observed after 5 min of morphine stimulation . The initial level of activated ERKs in these cells was also augmented . Moreover , the cellular response to withdrawal signals and chronic opioid treatment was diminished . These differences suggest that both CREB-dependent and Elk-1-dependent transcription contribute to the expression of proteins regulating morphine-induced P29323 activity ( particular phosphatases , upstream kinases or their activatory proteins ) .
