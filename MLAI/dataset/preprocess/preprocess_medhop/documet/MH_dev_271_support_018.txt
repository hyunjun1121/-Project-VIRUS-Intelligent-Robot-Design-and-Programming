Calcineurin-inhibitor-free immunosuppression based on the JAK inhibitor CP-690,550 : a pilot study in de novo kidney allograft recipients . This randomized , pilot study compared the Janus kinase inhibitor CP-690,550 ( 15 mg P55957 [ CP15 ] and 30 mg P55957 [ CP30 ] , n = 20 each ) with tacrolimus ( n = 21 ) in de novo kidney allograft recipients . Patients received an P60568 receptor antagonist , concomitant mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ) and corticosteroids . CP-690,550 doses were reduced after 6 months . Due to a high incidence of BK virus nephropathy ( BKN ) in CP30 , DB00688 was discontinued in this group . The 6-month biopsy-proven acute rejection rates were 1 of 20 , 4 of 20 and 1 of 21 for CP15 , CP30 and tacrolimus groups , respectively . BKN developed in 4 of 20 patients in CP30 group . The 6-month rates of cytomegalovirus disease were 2 of 20 , 4 of 20 and none of 21 for CP15 , CP30 and tacrolimus groups , respectively . Estimated glomerular filtration rate was > 70 mL/min at 6 and 12 months ( all groups ) . NK cells were reduced by </= 77 % in CP-690,550-treated patients . In the CP-690,550 arms , there were modest lipid elevations and a trend toward more frequent anemia and neutropenia during the first 6 months . These data suggest that coadministration of CP-690,550 30 mg P55957 with DB00688 is associated with overimmunosuppression . At 15 mg P55957 , the efficacy/safety profile was comparable to the tacrolimus control group , excepting a higher rate of viral infection . Further dose-ranging evaluation of CP-690,550 is warranted .
