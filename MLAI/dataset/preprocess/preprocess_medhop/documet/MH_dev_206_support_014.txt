Relative expression of cholesterol transport-related proteins and inflammation markers through the induction of 7-ketosterol-mediated stress in Caco-2 cells . Human diets contain sterol oxidation products that can induce cytotoxic effects , mainly caused by cholesterol oxides . However , phytosterol oxides effects have been less extensively investigated . This study evaluates the production of inflammatory biomarkers ( IL-1β , P10145 , P22301 , TNFα ) and the influence of gene expression transporters and enzymes related to cholesterol absorption and metabolism ( Q9UHC9 , Q9H222 /8 , HMGCoA , ACAT ) produced by 7-ketosterols ( stigmasterol/cholesterol ) in Caco-2 cells . These effects were linked to intracellular signaling pathways by using several inhibitors . Results showed 7-ketostigmasterol to have a greater proinflammatory potential than 7-ketocholesterol . In non-pre-treated cells , only efflux transporters were down-regulated by 7-ketosterols , showing a greater influence upon Q9H222 expression . Cell-pre-incubation with bradykinin induced changes in ABCG expression levels after 7-ketostigmasterol-incubation ; however , the energetic metabolism inhibition reduced Q9UHC9 expression only in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells . In non-pre-treated cells , HMG- DB01992 was up-regulated by both 7-ketosterols . However , exposure to inhibitors down-regulated the expression levels , mainly in 7-ketocholesterol-incubated cells . While ACAT expression values in non-pre-treated cells were unchanged , exposure to inhibitors caused down-regulation of mRNA levels . These results suggest that internalization and excretion of 7-ketostigmasterol is probably influenced by [Ca]i , which also could mediate HMGCoA activity in POPs metabolism . However , energetic metabolism and reducing equivalents exert different influences upon the 7-ketosterol internalization .
