Comparative effects of azimilide and ambasilide on the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( Q12809 ) potassium channel . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effects of azimilide and ambasilide on the biophysical properties of the human-ether-a-go-go-related ( Q12809 ) channel . METHODS : Q12809 was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO- P04264 ) cells and currents were measured using a whole cell , voltage-clamp technique . RESULTS : DB04957 had a ' dual effect ' , inhibiting current at voltage steps above -40 mV and augmenting current at -40 and -50 mV . Tail current inhibition following a step to +30 mV did not vary with temperature ( IC(50) 610 nM at 22 degrees C and 560 nM at 37 degrees C ) . The agonist effect at -50 mV was concentration-dependent and correlated with a hyperpolarizing shift in the V(1/2) of activation ( r=0.98 , P < 0.05 ) . Time constants of inactivation were faster and there was a -10 mV shift in the V(1/2) of steady state inactivation suggestive of open and inactivated state binding . By comparison , ambasilide inhibited Q12809 channels with lower potency ( IC(50) 3.6 microM ) , in a voltage- and time-dependent but frequency-independent manner ( 0.03-1 Hz ) . Ambasilide had no effect on activation or inactivation gating but prolonged both fast and slow components of deactivation consistent with unbinding from the open state . The net effect of both drugs was similar during a voltage ramp which simulated a cardiac action potential . CONCLUSIONS : Inhibition of Q12809 channels by azimilide and ambasilide exhibits a similar time and voltage-dependence . While both exhibit affinity for the open state , azimilide also binds to inactivated channels .
