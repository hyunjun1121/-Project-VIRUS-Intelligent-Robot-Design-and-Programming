Pancreatic gene expression during the initiation of acute pancreatitis : identification of P18146 as a key regulator . We hypothesized that genes expressed in pancreatic acinar cells during the initiation of acute pancreatitis determine the severity of the disease . Therefore , we utilized microarrays to identify those genes commonly induced in rat pancreatic acinar cells within 1-4 h in two in vivo models , caerulein and taurocholate administration . This strategy yielded 51 known genes representing a complex array of molecules , including those that are likely to either reduce or increase the severity of the disease . Novel genes identified in the current study included P18847 , BRF1 , C/EBPbeta , P80511 , P18146 , ephrinA1 , villin2 , ferredoxin , latexin , lipocalin , P28562 , NGFI-B , RhoA , tissue factor ( TF ) , and syndecan . To validate these microarray results , the role of P18146 was further investigated using quantitative RT-PCR , Western blotting , and immunocytochemistry . P18146 expression occurred within acinar cells and correlated with the development of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in rats . Furthermore , the levels of the inflammation-related genes P13500 , P05121 , TF , P05231 , and P05362 and the extent of lung inflammation were reduced during the initiation of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in P18146 -deficient mice . Thus this study identified P18146 and several other novel genes likely to be important in the development and severity of acute pancreatitis .
