Hypoxia-mediated expression of P09917 -activating protein involves HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB and microRNAs 135a and 199a-5p . Hypoxia occurs in a number of pathological states , such as pulmonary , hematological , and cardiovascular disorders . In this study , we examined the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia contributes to increased leukotriene formation . Our studies showed hypoxia augmented the expression of P09917 activating protein ( P20292 ) , a key enzyme in leukotriene formation , in both human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and a transformed human brain endothelial cell line . Hypoxia-induced P20292 mRNA expression involved activation of NADPH-oxidase , P19957 kinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase , NF-kappaB , and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -1alpha . Hypoxia-induced P20292 promoter activity was attenuated on mutation of hypoxia-response elements ( HREs ) and NF-kappaB binding motif in the P20292 promoter . Hypoxia also augmented binding of HIF-1alpha to HREs in P20292 promoter as demonstrated by EMSA with nuclear extracts . Furthermore , chromain immunoprecipitation analysis showed HIF-1alpha bound to HREs in native chromatin obtained from hypoxia-treated cells . Next , we examined the role of HIF-1alpha regulated microRNAs on P20292 expression . Our studies showed decreased expression of miR-135a and miR-199a-5p in response to hypoxia . However , overexpression of anti-miR-135a and anti-miR-199a-5p oligonucleotides led to a several fold increased P20292 mRNA and protein expression . These studies demonstrate for the first time that hypoxia-mediated P20292 expression is regulated by HREs and NF-kappaB site in its promoter , and negatively regulated by miR-135a and miR-199a-5p , which target the 3'-UTR of P20292 mRNA . An understanding of these regulatory pathways provides new avenues to ameliorate leukotriene formation and hence reactive airway disease , and inflammation in individuals who have sickle cell disease .
