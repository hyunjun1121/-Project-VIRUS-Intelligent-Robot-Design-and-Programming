Agonism of human pregnane X receptor by rilpivirine and etravirine : comparison with first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors . DB08864 and etravirine are second generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors approved recently by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection . O75469 ( O75469 ) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of various genes controlling diverse biological functions . The present study investigated the effects of rilpivirine and etravirine on the activity of human O75469 ( hPXR ) , including the mode of activation , and compared them to those of efavirenz , nevirapine , and delavirdine , which are first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors . In transiently transfected HepG2 cells , rilpivirine , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , activated human , mouse , and rat O75469 . Results from mechanistic studies indicated that rilpivirine , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , bound to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR , as assessed by a transactivation assay and by a competitive ligand-binding assay using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer ; triggered nuclear translocation of a green fluorescence protein-tagged hPXR , as visualized by confocal imaging ; and recruited steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) , P12931 -2 , and Q9Y6Q9 to hPXR , as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays . DB08864 , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , increased hPXR target gene ( P08684 ) expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes . In summary , select non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors activated human and rodent O75469 . DB08864 , etravirine , and efavirenz , but not nevirapine or delavirdine , were identified as agonists of hPXR , as assessed in mechanistic experiments , and inducers of P08684 , as determined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes .
