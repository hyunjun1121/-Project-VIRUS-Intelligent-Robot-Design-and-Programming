Expression profiles of mitochondrial genes in the frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus of developing humans and mice selectively bred for high and low fear . A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial function may be important in brain development and psychiatric disorders . However , detailed expression profiles of those genes in human brain development and fear-related behavior remain unclear . Using microarray data available from the public domain and the Gene Ontology analysis , we identified the genes and the functional categories associated with chronological age in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) and the caudate nucleus ( CN ) of psychiatrically normal humans ranging in age from birth to 50 years . Among those , we found that a substantial number of genes in the P27918 ( 115 ) and the CN ( 117 ) are associated with the GO term : mitochondrion ( FDR qv < 0.05 ) . A greater number of the genes in the P27918 ( 91 % ) than the genes in the CN ( 62 % ) showed a linear increase in expression during postnatal development . Using quantitative PCR , we validated the developmental expression pattern of four genes including monoamine oxidase B ( P27338 ) , DB00157 dehydrogenase flavoprotein ( P49821 ) , mitochondrial uncoupling protein 5 ( O95258 ) and tubulin beta-3 chain ( Q13509 ) . In mice , overall developmental expression pattern of P27338 , O95258 and Q13509 in the P27918 were comparable to the pattern observed in humans ( p < 0.05 ) . However , mice selectively bred for high fear did not exhibit normal developmental changes of P27338 and Q13509 . These findings suggest that the genes associated with mitochondrial function in the P27918 play a significant role in brain development and fear-related behavior .
