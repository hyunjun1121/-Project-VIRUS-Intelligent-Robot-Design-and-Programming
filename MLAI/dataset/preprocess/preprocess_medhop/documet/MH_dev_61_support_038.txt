Intermediate phenotype analysis of patients , unaffected siblings , and healthy controls identifies Q05940 as a candidate gene for psychotic disorder and neurocognition . Psychotic disorders are associated with neurocognitive alterations that aggregate in unaffected family members , suggesting that genetic vulnerability to psychotic disorder impacts neurocognition . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether selected schizophrenia candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) are associated with ( 1 ) neurocognitive functioning across populations at different genetic risk for psychosis ( 2 ) and psychotic disorder . The association between 152 SNPs in 43 candidate genes and a composite measure of neurocognitive functioning was examined in 718 patients with psychotic disorder . Follow-up analyses were carried out in 750 unaffected siblings and 389 healthy comparison subjects . In the patients , 13 associations between SNPs and cognitive functioning were significant at P < .05 , situated in P21728 , P35462 , Q01959 , P23560 , P09038 , Q05940 , Q13451 , and Q9UBC3 . Follow-up of these SNPs revealed a significant and directionally similar association for Q05940 ( alternatively Q05940 ) rs363227 in siblings ( B = -0.13 , P = .04 ) and a trend association in control subjects ( B = -0.10 , P = .12 ) . This association was accompanied by a significantly increased risk for psychotic disorder associated with the T allele ( linear OR = 1.51 , 95 % CI 1.10-2.07 , P = .01 ) , which was reduced when covarying for cognitive performance ( OR = 1.29 , 95 % CI 0.92-1.81 , P = .14 ) , suggesting mediation . Genetic variation in Q05940 may be linked to alterations in cognitive functioning underlying psychotic disorder , possibly through altered transport of monoamines into synaptic vesicles .
