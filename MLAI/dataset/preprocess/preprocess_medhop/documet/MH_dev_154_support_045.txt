P12821 inhibition suppresses plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in the neointima of balloon-injured rat aorta . BACKGROUND : P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , an important regulator of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix turnover , has been implicated in a number of vascular diseases . Studies demonstrating angiotensin II ( Ang II ) to be a potent stimulator of P05121 expression in cultured vascular cells suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may modulate vascular P05121 expression . METHODS AND RESULTS : We examined the effects of the P12821 inhibitor captopril on P05121 expression in control and balloon-injured rat aorta . Northern blot analysis demonstrated that aortic P05121 mRNA expression was 7.6-fold elevated 3 hours ( P < .05 ) after balloon injury , back to baseline at 2 days , increased again at 4 days , and by 7 days after balloon injury was 3.2-fold elevated ( P < .05 ) when compared with control . In captopril-treated rats , the induction of P05121 expression by balloon injury was significantly suppressed by 44 % ( P < .05 ) in the 7 day group but was not altered in the 3-hour group . DB01197 also reduced baseline aortic P05121 mRNA . In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed dense P05121 staining of 7-day neointima in untreated rats and a dramatic decrease in P05121 in neointima of captopril-treated rats . CONCLUSIONS : This report demonstrates that balloon injury results in both a rapid P12821 inhibitor-independent induction of aortic P05121 expression and a later increase in P05121 in the neointima that is significantly suppressed by captopril . This provides the first evidence that the renin-angiotensin system regulates neointimal P05121 expression and that P12821 inhibitors can reduce P05121 in the vessel wall in vivo .
