Human cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -3 and P05231 affect the growth and insulin binding of the unicellular organism Tetrahymena . Interleukin ( IL ) -3 and P05231 significantly increase the growth rate of the unicellular organism , Tetrahymena . The effect elicited by P08700 is long lasting as it was also detectable after 20 generations . Effect of P05231 was detectable as long as the substance was present in the cell culture . Pretreatment with P08700 did not enhance the proliferative response to subsequent P08700 treatment , but the second exposure to P08700 considerably depressed the active proliferation of Tetrahymena cells . However , a positive ' priming effect ' elicited by P05231 resulted in an increased growth rate following repeated P05231 stimulation . P01308 binding to the plasma membrane of Tetrahymena was increased by P05231 but not by P08700 after 24 hours , and this enhancement appeared even after one hour incubation . If the cells were pretreated with insulin , P05231 did not influence insulin binding , while an inhibition by P08700 was observed . These results direct attention to the similarities of actions induced by P08700 and P05231 at different levels of phylogeny probably due to the presence of cytokine receptor-like structures on this unicellular organism .
