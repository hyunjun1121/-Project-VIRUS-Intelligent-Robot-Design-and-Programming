Gene therapy-mediated delivery of targeted cytotoxins for glioma therapeutics . Restricting the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on tumor cells is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . GBMs express an P35225 receptor ( IL13Rα2 ) that differs from the physiological P24394 /IL13R receptor . We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector ( Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE ) encoding a mutated human P35225 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin ( mhIL-13-PE ) that specifically binds to IL13Rα2 to provide sustained expression , effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity , and minimal neurotoxicity . The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human P05112 that binds to the physiological P24394 /IL13R without interacting with IL13Rα2 , thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells . Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models , we tested the Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and two protein formulations , hIL-13-PE used in clinical trials ( DB05305 ) and a second-generation mhIL-13-PE . DB05305 doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity ; mhIL-13-PE led to ∼40 % long-term survival , eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested . In contrast , Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL-13-PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70 % of the animals , without causing apparent neurotoxicity . Although DB05305 was originally developed to target GBM , when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity . Limitations of DB05305 include its short half-life , which demanded frequent or continued administration , and binding to P24394 /IL13R , present in normal brain cells . These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad , thus representing a significant advance in the development of targeted therapeutics for GBM .
