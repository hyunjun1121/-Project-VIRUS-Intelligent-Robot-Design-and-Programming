Predictive gene signatures : molecular markers distinguishing colon adenomatous polyp and carcinoma . Cancers exhibit abnormal molecular signatures associated with disease initiation and progression . Molecular signatures could improve cancer screening , detection , drug development and selection of appropriate drug therapies for individual patients . Typically only very small amounts of tissue are available from patients for analysis and biopsy samples exhibit broad heterogeneity that can not be captured using a single marker . This report details application of an in-house custom designed GenomeLab System multiplex gene expression assay , the hCellMarkerPlex , to assess predictive gene signatures of normal , adenomatous polyp and carcinoma colon tissue using archived tissue bank material . The hCellMarkerPlex incorporates twenty-one gene markers : epithelial ( P15311 , P05783 , Q9Y5S8 , Q9UBY0 ) , proliferation ( P12004 , P24385 , Q9NXJ0 ) , differentiation ( B4GANLT2 , P47902 , Q99626 ) , apoptotic ( P42574 , Q9Y5S8 , O95631 ) , fibroblast ( FSP1 , P02452 ) , structural ( P63267 , P51911 , DES ) , gene transcription ( Q13547 ) , stem cell ( O75473 ) , endothelial ( P04275 ) and mucin production ( Q02817 ) . Gene signatures distinguished normal , adenomatous polyp and carcinoma . Individual gene targets significantly contributing to molecular tissue types , classifier genes , were further characterised using real-time PCR , in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry revealing aberrant epithelial expression of Q9NXJ0 , O75473 Q99626 , Q9Y5S8 and Q9UBY0 prior to development of carcinoma . Identified gene signatures identify aberrant epithelial expression of genes prior to cancer development using in-house custom designed gene expression multiplex assays . This approach may be used to assist in objective classification of disease initiation , staging , progression and therapeutic responses using biopsy material .
