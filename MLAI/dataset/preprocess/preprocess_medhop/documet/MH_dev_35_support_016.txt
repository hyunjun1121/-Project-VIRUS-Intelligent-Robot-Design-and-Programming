P13688 impedes thyroid cancer growth but promotes invasiveness : a putative mechanism for early metastases . P13688 , also known as biliary glycoprotein ( BGP ) , CD66a , Q00839 and C- P62158 , is a member of the P06731 immunoglobulin superfamily . P13688 is a putative tumor suppressor based on diminished expression in some solid neoplasms such as colorectal carcinoma . However , P13688 is overexpressed in some tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer . To clarify the mechanism of action of this cell adhesion molecule , we studied thyroid carcinoma that has a spectrum of morphologies and variable behavior allowing separation of proliferation from invasion and metastasis . P13688 is expressed in thyroid carcinoma cell lines derived from tumors that exhibit aggressive behavior . Introduction of P13688 into endogenously deficient WRO cells resulted in reduced cell cycle progression associated with P38936 upregulation and diminished Rb phosphorylation . Forced P13688 expression enhanced cell-matrix adhesion and migration and promoted tumor invasiveness . Conversely , small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) -mediated downregulation of P13688 expression in Q9BYG7 cells accelerated cell cycle progression and significantly enhanced tumor size in xenografted mice . P13688 is not appreciably expressed in normal thyroid tissue or benign thyroid tumors . In a human thyroid tissue array , P13688 reactivity was associated with metastatic spread but not with increased tumor size . These findings identify P13688 as a unique mediator that restricts tumor growth whereas increasing metastatic potential . Our data highlight a complex repertoire of actions providing a putative mechanism underlying the spectrum of biologic behaviors associated with thyroid cancer .
