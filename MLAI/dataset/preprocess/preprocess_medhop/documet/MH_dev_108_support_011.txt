P01375 -alpha antagonists twenty years later : what do Cochrane reviews tell us ? In 1998 , the U.S . Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory approval to the first tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist , infliximab , for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn 's disease . As of 2013 , there were 3 additional tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists commercially available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in the United States : adalimumab , certolizumab pegol , and DB06674 . Despite a vast literature describing both clinical trial and clinical practice experience with these agents , there remain important questions regarding the efficacy and safety of tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease . These questions and the best available evidence to answer them were discussed during a Cochrane Collaboration session held at the 2013 Digestive Diseases Week annual meeting . This article reviews the data from that session .
