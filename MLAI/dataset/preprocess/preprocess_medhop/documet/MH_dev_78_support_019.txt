DB00945 inhibits Chlamydia pneumoniae-induced NF-kappa B activation , cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 synthesis and attenuates chlamydial growth . Infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated as a potential risk factor for atherosclerosis . This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of the anti-chlamydial activity of aspirin . A reporter gene assay for NF-kappa B activity , immunoblot analysis for cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 and radioimmunoassay for prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) were performed . Following infection of HEp-2 cells with C. pneumoniae , NF-kappa B was activated , P35354 was induced and PGE(2) was elevated . DB00945 inhibited NF-kappa B activation at a concentration of 0.1 mM , partially inhibited P35354 induction and blocked PGE(2) synthesis completely . In addition , high doses of aspirin ( 1 and 2 mM ) inhibited chlamydial growth in HEp-2 cells , decreasing the number and size of inclusion bodies ; this effect could be overcome by adding tryptophan to the culture . Indomethacin also blocked the synthesis of PGE(2) , but had no effect on P35354 expression or chlamydial growth . These results indicate that aspirin not only has an anti-inflammatory activity through prevention of NF-kappa B activation but also has anti-chlamydial activity at high doses , possibly through depletion of tryptophan in HEp-2 cells .
