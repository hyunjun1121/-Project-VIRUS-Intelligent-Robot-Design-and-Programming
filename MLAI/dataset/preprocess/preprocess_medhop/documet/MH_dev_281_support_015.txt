Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor , TUPS , protects against isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : We have previously shown that isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy causes significant changes in the expression of cytochromes P450 ( CYP ) and soluble epoxide hydrolase ( sEH ) genes . Therefore , it is important to examine whether the inhibition of sEH by 1-(1-methanesulfonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-urea ( TUPS ) will protect against isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with TUPS ( 0.65 mg kg(-1) day(-1) , p.o. ) , isoprenaline ( 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) , i.p. ) or the combination of both . In vitro H9c2 cells were treated with isoprenaline ( 100 μM ) in the presence and absence of either TUPS ( 1 μM ) or 11,12 EET ( 1 μM ) . The expression of hypertrophic , fibrotic markers and different CYP genes were determined by real-time PCR . KEY RESULTS : Isoprenaline significantly induced the hypertrophic , fibrotic markers as well as the heart to body weight ratio , which was significantly reversed by TUPS . Isoprenaline also caused an induction of P04798 , Q16678 , CYP2B1 , CYP2B2 , CYP4A3 and CYP4F4 gene expression and TUPS significantly inhibited this isoprenaline-mediated effect . Moreover , isoprenaline significantly reduced 5,6- , 8,9- , 11,12- and 14,15-EET and increased their corresponding 8,9- , 11,12- and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid ( DHET ) and the 20-HETE metabolites . TUPS abolished these isoprenaline-mediated changes in arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolites . In H9c2 cells , isoprenaline caused a significant induction of P01160 , DB04899 and P34913 mRNA levels . Both TUPS and 11,12-EET significantly decreased this isoprenaline-mediated induction of P01160 , DB04899 and P34913 . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : TUPS partially protects against isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy , which confirms the role of sEH and CYP enzymes in the development of cardiac hypertrophy .
