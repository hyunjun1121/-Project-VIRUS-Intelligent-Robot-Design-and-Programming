Functional identification of NR2 subunits contributing to DB01221 receptors on DB05875 receptor-expressing dorsal horn neurons . DB01221 receptors are important elements in pain signaling in the spinal cord dorsal horn . They are heterotetramers typically composed of two Q9UHB4 and two of four NR2 subunits : Q12879 -2D . Mice lacking specific NR2 subunits show deficits in pain transmission yet subunit location in the spinal cord remains unclear . We have combined electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches to investigate the composition of functional DB01221 receptors expressed by lamina I , DB05875 receptor-expressing ( P25103 + ) neurons , as well as P25103 - neurons . Under low Mg2+ conditions ( 100 microM ) , the conductance of DB01221 receptors at -90 mV ( g ( -90 mV ) ) with Q12879 or Q13224 subunits ( Q12879 /B ) is low compared to conductance measured at the membrane potential where the inward current is maximal or maximal inward current ( MIC ) ( ratio of approximately 0.07 calculated from Kuner and Schoepfer , 1996 ) . For Q14957 or O15399 subunits ( Q14957 /D ) , the ratio is higher ( ratio approximately 0.4 ) . P25103 + and P25103 - neurons express DB01221 receptors that give ratios approximately 0.28 and 0.16 , respectively , suggesting both types of subunits are present in both populations of neurons , with P25103 + neurons expressing a higher percentage of Q14957 /D type DB01221 receptors . This was confirmed using EAB318 , an Q12879 /B preferring antagonist , and UBP141 , a mildly selective Q14957 /D antagonist to increase and decrease the g ( -90 mV ) /g(MIC) ratios in both subpopulations of neurons .
