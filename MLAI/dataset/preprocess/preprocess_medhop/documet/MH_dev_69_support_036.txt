Candidate gene studies of ADHD : a meta-analytic review . Quantitative genetic studies ( i.e. , twin and adoption studies ) suggest that genetic influences contribute substantially to the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Over the past 15 years , considerable efforts have been made to identify genes involved in the etiology of this disorder resulting in a large and often conflicting literature of candidate gene associations for ADHD . The first aim of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive meta-analytic review of this literature to determine which candidate genes show consistent evidence of association with childhood ADHD across studies . The second aim was to test for heterogeneity across studies in the effect sizes for each candidate gene as its presence might suggest moderating variables that could explain inconsistent results . Significant associations were identified for several candidate genes including Q01959 , P21917 , P21918 , P31645 , P28222 , and P60880 . Further , significant heterogeneity was observed for the associations between ADHD and Q01959 , P21917 , P21918 , P09172 , P08913 , P31645 , Q8IWU9 , P21397 , and P60880 , suggesting that future studies should explore potential moderators of these associations ( e.g. , ADHD subtype diagnoses , gender , exposure to environmental risk factors ) . We conclude with a discussion of these findings in relation to emerging themes relevant to future studies of the genetics of ADHD .
