P34947 regulates beta 1-adrenergic receptor association with P78352 . We previously reported that the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor ( beta(1)AR ) associates with P78352 through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction , by which P78352 modulates beta(1)AR function and facilitates the physical association of beta(1)AR with other synaptic proteins such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors . Here we demonstrate that beta(1)AR association with P78352 is regulated by P34947 ( P34947 ) . When beta(1)AR and P78352 were coexpressed with either P25098 or P34947 in COS-7 cells , P34947 alone dramatically decreased the association of beta(1)AR with P78352 , although P25098 and P34947 both could be co-immunoprecipitated with beta(1)AR and both could enhance receptor phosphorylation in vivo . Increasing expression of P34947 in the cells led to further decreased beta(1)AR association with P78352 . Stimulation with the beta(1)AR agonist isoproterenol further decreased P78352 binding to beta(1)AR . In addition , P34947 protein kinase activity was required for this regulatory effect since a kinase-inactive P34947 mutant had no effect on P78352 binding to beta(1)AR . Moreover , the regulatory effect of P34947 on beta(1)AR association with P78352 was observed only when P34947 was expressed together with the receptor , but not when P34947 was coexpressed with P78352 . Thus , we propose that P34947 regulates beta(1)AR association with P78352 through phosphorylation of beta(1)AR . Regulation of protein association through receptor phosphorylation may be a general mechanism used by G protein-coupled receptors that associate via PDZ domain-mediated protein/protein interactions .
