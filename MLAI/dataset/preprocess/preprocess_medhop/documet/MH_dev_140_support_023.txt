In-silico screening and in-vitro validation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 ( P35968 ) inhibitors . P35968 tyrosine kinase receptor draws attention of the scientific fraternity in drug discovery for its important role in cancer , cardiopulmonary , cardiovascular diseases etc . Hence there is a need for novel P35968 inhibitors screening and testing for their biological activities . The 3D-structure was collected from PDB and stability was checked by using WHATIF and PROCHECK programs and subjected for virtual screening on Zinc database . We used virtual screening method to screen new P35968 blocker molecules based on their binding energies and then docked with active site on the receptor with the help of AUTODOCK software . Based on the results obtained top three molecules ( VRB1-3 ) were selected and tested in Cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells for cell viability under hypoxic condition . The invitro studies showed VRB2 as the best molecule among the selected three molecules as well as with a standard commercial drug DB01268 .
