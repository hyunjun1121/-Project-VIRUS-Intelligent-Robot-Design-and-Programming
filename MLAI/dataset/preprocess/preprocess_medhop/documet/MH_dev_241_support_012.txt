Expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme upon induction of lymphocyte differentiation and V(D)J recombination . Murine preB lymphocytes grow in tissue culture in the presence of stromal cells and interleukin 7 ( P13232 ) , and can be induced to differentiate to surface-immunoglobulin-positive B cells in vitro by withdrawal of P13232 . Upon differentiation , proliferation ceases , and upregulation of Rag-1 and Rag-2 expression , and induction of V(D)J immunoglobulin-gene rearrangements occur . DNA-dependent protein kinase ( DNA-PK ) is required for effective V(D)J recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks . The holoenzyme comprises a catalytic subunit ( P78527 ) and the Ku heterodimer ( P12956 / P13010 ) . We have analyzed expression of P12956 , P13010 and P78527 upon induction of differentiation in preB cells derived from wild-type , severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) and Rag-2-/- mice . Protein levels of P13010 and P12956 moderately decrease after induction in all three cell types . A distinct polypeptide that crossreacts with anti-Ku Ig appears in the cytoplasm of wild-type and Rag-2-/- cells , but not of SCID cells . In mouse preB cells , P12956 and P13010 are present in the nuclei and cytoplasm before and after onset of differentiation . In vivo , P12956 is predominantly expressed in V(D)J-recombination-active , early-preB and P01730 -/CD8- thymocyte cell populations . Upon differentiation , protein levels of P78527 are unaltered . DNA-PK activity , which is not detectable in SCID cells , increases in wild-type and Rag-2-/- cells more than twofold shortly after induction of differentiation , then falls back to about 50 % of starting levels .
