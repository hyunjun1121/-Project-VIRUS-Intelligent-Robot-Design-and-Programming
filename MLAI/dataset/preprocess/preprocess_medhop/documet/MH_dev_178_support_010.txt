Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase by atrial natriuretic peptide . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) is known to suppress platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -stimulated proliferation of rat cultured vascular smooth muscle cells . The present study examined whether P01160 inhibits the PDGF receptor ( P09619 ) tyrosine kinase activation , an initial event for PDGF cellular signaling . P01160 reduced the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of P09619 stimulated by PDGF in a dose-dependent manner . This effect was not due to the reduction in P09619 protein as detected by immunoblot analysis . 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP , a membrane-permeable 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP ) derivative , mimicked the action of P01160 . HS-142-1 , an antagonist for guanylate cyclase A ( P16066 ) and B , co-incubated with P01160 , restored the PDGF-induced P09619 autophosphorylation . The effect of P01160 was also observed in the presence of a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , sodium orthovanadate . To confirm that P01160 exerts its action by inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) , an in vitro kinase assay was performed . Cyclic GMP inhibited PTK activity of P09619 partially purified by lectin affinity chromatography . In contrast , PTK activity in immobilized P09619 immunocomplexes was not inhibited by cGMP . However , exogenous cGMP dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) reduced the PTK activity in the presence of cGMP . These results demonstrate that P01160 suppresses P09619 PTK through P16066 probably by activating PKG . This may be an important mechanism by which P01160 exerts its anti-proliferative action antagonizing PDGF .
