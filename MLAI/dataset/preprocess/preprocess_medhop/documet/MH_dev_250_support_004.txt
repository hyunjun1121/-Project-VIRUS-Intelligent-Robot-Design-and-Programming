Purification and characterization of mouse O15528 overproduced by an Escherichia coli system coexpressing molecular chaperonins GroEL/ES . The expression of mouse O15528 in Escherichia coli has been dramatically enhanced by coexpression of GroEL/ES . To reveal the enzymatic properties of O15528 , we measured its hydroxylation activity toward vitamin D3 and DB01436 ( 1alpha(OH)D3 ) in addition to the physiological substrate DB00146 . Surprisingly , O15528 converted vitamin D3 to 1alpha, DB00146 . Both 1alpha-hydroxylation activity toward vitamin D3 , and 25-hydroxylation activity toward 1alpha(OH)D3 were observed . The Km and Vmax values for 25-hydroxylation activity toward 1alpha(OH)D3 were estimated to be 1.7 microM and 0.51 mol/min/mol P450 , respectively , while those for 1alpha-hydroxylation activity toward DB00146 were 0.050 microM and 2.73 mol/min/mol P450 , respectively . Note that the substrate must be fixed in the opposite direction in the substrate-binding pocket of O15528 between 1alpha-hydroxylation and 25-hydroxylation . Based on these results and the fact that human Q02318 and Streptomyces CYP105A1 also convert vitamin D3 to 1alpha, DB00146 , 1alpha-hydroxylation , and 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 appear to be closely linked together .
