Coordination complexes with the redox active tetrathiafulvalene based imino-pyrazine ligand : syntheses , a radical cation salt , crystal structures and electrochemistry . The tetrathiafulvalene based 2-immino-pyrazine derivative ( Q15669 -CHN-2-pyz ) ( ) was synthesized and characterized . Its radical cation salt ( (+)PF(6)(-) ) was prepared as single crystals by electrocrystallisation . (+)PF(6)(-) crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group . Four 1 : 2 bis(hexafluoroacetylacetonate)M(ii) complexes coordinated with were prepared ( M = Mn for , M = Co for , M = Cu for and M = DB01593 for ) . Complex crystallizes in the monoclinic P06681 /c space group , complexes and crystallize in the triclinic space group P1 . Two pyrazine N atoms from two different donors are coordinated in cis configuration for and trans configuration for and to the metallic ion of M(hfac)(2) ( hfac(-)=hexafluoroacetylacetonate anion ) . The manganese atom adopts a pseudo-compressed octahedral geometry while the copper and the zinc ions adopt axially elongated octahedral geometries . Both crystal packing structures and electrochemical properties are appropriate for their potential use as starting molecular bricks for conducting and magnetic materials .
