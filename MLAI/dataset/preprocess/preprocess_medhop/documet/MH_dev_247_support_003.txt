Recent advances relating to the clinical application of naked monoclonal antibodies in solid tumors . This review focuses on the recent advances in clinical data regarding antibody-based therapy in the management of solid tumors . We also discuss perspectives on antibody-based therapy in the future . Thorough understanding of the complex interactions between components of the immunological response has led to interest in the concept of immune-mediated therapy for solid tumors . Over the last few years , several humanized and chimeric monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) targeting human epidermal receptor 2 ( P04626 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) have been employed in treating solid tumors , including breast , colorectal , lung , head and neck , and gynecologic cancers . DB00072 , bevacizumab , cetuximab , and panitumumab are MAbs that are most widely used in clinical practice with acceptable rates of adverse events . Combination of MAbs with small-molecule inhibitors of the same pathway could potentially increase the efficacy and specificity of antibody-based treatment . Immune-mediated effects may be further exploited with the use of bivalent molecules .
