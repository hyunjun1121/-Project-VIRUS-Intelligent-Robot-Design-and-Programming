Q13547 contributes to cell cycle and apoptosis . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are generally thought to play important roles in human disease . However , little information is available concerning the specific functions of individual HDACs . We previously reported on transgenic mice that expressed human Q13547 and experienced steatosis and nuclear pleomorphism in their hepatic tissues . To find out if the over-expression of Q13547 contributes to the expression of genes related to the cell cycle , apoptosis , and lipid metabolism that eventually contribute to the pathological changes in the livers of the transgenic mice , the expression profiles of the related genes in liver tissues were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and Western blot analysis . The activated human Q13547 significantly induced the expression levels of mRNA for p53 , P37231 and Bak and reduced the P38936 expression level compared with the levels in control littermates . However , the protein levels of p53 and P37231 were significantly decreased . In conclusion , our results indicate that Q13547 can regulate gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels independently and that this may be a potential cytopathic factor for hepatic tissue in transgenic mice that over-express Q13547 .
