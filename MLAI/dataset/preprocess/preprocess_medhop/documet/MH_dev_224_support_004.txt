P00533 cooperates with glucose transporter P13866 to enable chromatin remodeling in response to ionizing radiation . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : P00533 and the sodium-dependent glucose transporter , P13866 , are found in complex after radiation treatment . The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of P00533 in glucose uptake and chromatin remodeling . MATERIAL AND METHODS : DB09341 accumulation was quantified with help of (3)H-glucose . Involvement of SGLT was detected by a specific inhibitor . Role of P00533 was proved by P00533 overexpression and siRNA driven knockdown . Functional endpoints were intracellular DB00171 levels , protein expression , residual DNA-damage and colony formation . RESULTS : P00533 / P13866 interactions in response to ionizing radiation were associated with increased glucose uptake . Nevertheless , tumor cells exhibit DB00171 depletion following irradiation . Recovery from radiation-induced DB00171 crisis was P00533 /SGLT-dependent and associated with increased cell survival and improved DNA-repair . The blockage of either P00533 or SGLT inhibited DB00171 level recovery and histone H3 modifications crucial for both chromatin remodeling and DNA repair in response to irradiation . Inhibition of the acetyltransferase Q92993 , which is essential for histone H3- P35527 acetylation and Q13315 activation , prevented energy crisis and chromatin remodeling . CONCLUSIONS : Radiation-associated interactions between P13866 and P00533 resulted in increased glucose uptake , which counteracts the DB00171 crisis in tumor cells due to chromatin remodeling . The blockage of recovery from DB00171 crisis led to radio-sensitization in tumor cells .
