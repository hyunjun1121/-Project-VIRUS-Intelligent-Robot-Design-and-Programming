An endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor aggravates DB03429 -induced acute pancreatitis in rats . To clarify the role of nitric oxide ( NO ) in the development and progression of acute pancreatitis , we investigated the effect of different NO synthase inhibitors and NO donors on experimental pancreatitis in rats . Closed duodenal loop ( DB03429 ) -induced pancreatitis was produced in male Wistar rats , and the animals were treated with normal saline , the NO-synthase substrate L-arginine , the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine , aminoguanidine , which is a more powerful inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) than is endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) , and N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) , a more powerful inhibitor of P29474 than of P35228 . All drugs were infused intravenously during a period of 6 or 12 h in each group . Pancreatic tissue was removed at 6 and 12 h after creating the DB03429 . L- DB00125 , S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine , and aminoguanidine treatment had no effect on the elevation of serum pancreatic enzymes , whereas L-NAME administration significantly exacerbated their elevation . Pathologically , L-NAME treatment resulted in a significantly worse histologic score at 6 and 12 h , especially in terms of the degree of hemorrhage , acinar cell necrosis , and microvascular thrombosis . Addition of L-arginine clearly reversed the effect of L-NAME . Neither the NO substrate nor NO donor could inhibit the progression of hemorrhagic pancreatitis in DB03429 -induced pancreatitis . DB02533 had no effect on the severity of the pancreatitis . We therefore concluded that NO production by P29474 may play a significant role in preventing the development and progression of acute pancreatitis .
