Progress in the field of P08514 /IIIa antagonists . Platelet aggregation plays an important role in pathological situations such as myocardial infarction , unstable angina , peripheral artery disease , and stroke . Thus , pharmacological agents that specifically inhibit platelet aggregation are of great interest in the treatment and prevention of these cardiovascular diseases . Since binding of activated glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex , a platelet surface integrin , to fibrinogen is the final step leading to platelet aggregation regardless of the initial stimulus , many researches have focused on the development of drugs that could antagonize this integrin . Three intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists are currently marketed for the prevention of myocardial infarction in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention : DB00054 , DB00063 and Tirofiban . To further test the clinical efficacy of these agents , oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists have been developed but only led to disappointing clinical results . Nevertheless , due to recognized usefulness of oral agents for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases , a great number of new orally active compounds are under clinical or preclinical evaluation . The aim of this review is to describe the chemical , pharmacological and clinical properties of existing and forthcoming glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists .
