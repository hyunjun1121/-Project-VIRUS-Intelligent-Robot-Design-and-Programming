Small in-frame deletion in the epidermal growth factor receptor as a target for DB05294 . DB05294 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 / P35968 ) tyrosine kinase , with additional activity against epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase . DB05294 inhibits angiogenesis and growth of a wide range of tumor models in vivo . Gefitinib ( " DB00317 " ) is a selective P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in cancer cell proliferation . Here , the ability of gefitinib and DB05294 to inhibit tumor cell proliferation was examined directly in eight cancer cell lines in vitro , and a strong correlation was noted between the IC(50) values of gefitinib and DB05294 ( r = 0.79 ) . No correlation was observed between the sensitivity to DB05294 and the level of P00533 or VEGFR expression . The NSCLC cell line PC-9 was seen to be hypersensitive to gefitinib and DB05294 , and a small ( 15-bp ) in-frame deletion of an DB00171 -binding site ( exon 19 ) in the P00533 was detected ( delE746-A750-type deletion ) . To clarify the involvement of the deletional mutation of P00533 in the cellular sensitivity to DB05294 , we examined the effect of this agent on HEK293 stable transfectants expressing deletional P00533 that designed as the same deletion site observed in PC-9 cells ( 293-pDelta15 ) . These cells exhibited a 60-fold higher sensitivity to DB05294 compared with transfectants expressing wild-type P00533 . DB05294 inhibited the phosphorylation of the mutant P00533 by 10-fold compared with cells with wild-type P00533 . In conclusion , the findings suggested that a small in-frame deletion in the P00533 increased the cellular sensitivity to DB05294 .
