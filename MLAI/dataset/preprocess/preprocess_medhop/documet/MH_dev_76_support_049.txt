The P38936 codon 31*C- and P14416 codon 313*T-related genotypes/alleles , but not P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , and P21728 -48 polymorphisms , are correlated with the presence of leiomyoma . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether the gene polymorphisms for P38936 , X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 ( P18887 ) , human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 ( hOGG1 ) , and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors ( P21728 , -2 ) are associated with leiomyoma susceptibility . DESIGN : Prospective study . SETTING : Departments of gynecology and genetics in a medical center . PATIENT(S) : Women were divided into two groups : leiomyoma ( n = 120 ) and nonleiomyoma ( n = 112 ) . INTERVENTION(S) : The P38936 codon 31 , P18887 codon 399 , hOGG1 codon 326 , P21728 -48 , and P14416 codon 313 polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with restriction enzyme digestions ( Blp I , MspI , Fnu4HI , Dde I , and NcoI , respectively ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Genotypes and allelic frequencies . RESULT(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyomas . The proportions of P38936 (*)CC/CA/AA and P14416 (*)CC/CT/TT in both groups were 27.5/68.3/4.2 % and 12.5/51.7/35.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 14.3/51.8/33.9 % and 33.9/40.2/25.9 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with the presence of leiomyomas . P18887 (*)GG/GA/AA , hOGG1(*)TT/TA/AA , and P21728 (*)GG/GA/AA were 54.2/37.5/8.3 % , 36.7/44.2/19.1 % , and 3.3/25.8/70.8 % ( leiomyoma ) ; and 48.2/47.3/4.5 % , 43.6/41/15.4 % , and 3.6/25/71.4 % ( nonleiomyoma ) . CONCLUSION(S) : The P38936 codon 31(*)C- and P14416 codon 313(*)T-related genotypes/alleles were associated with the presence of leiomyoma . P18887 , hOGG1 , and P21728 were not correlated with leiomyoma development .
