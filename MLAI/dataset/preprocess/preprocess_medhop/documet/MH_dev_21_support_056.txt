P00747 activator inhibitor type-1 inhibits insulin signaling by competing with alphavbeta3 integrin for vitronectin binding . Functional cooperation between integrins and growth factor receptors has been reported for several systems , one of which is the modulation of insulin signaling by alphavbeta3 integrin . P00747 activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) , competes with alphavbeta3 integrin for vitronectin ( VN ) binding . Here we report that P05121 , in a VN-dependent manner , prevents the cooperation of alphavbeta3 integrin with insulin signaling in NIH3T3 fibroblasts , resulting in a decrease in insulin-induced protein kinase B ( P31749 ) phosphorylation , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) expression and cell migration . P01308 -induced HUVEC migration and angiotube formation was also enhanced in the presence of VN and this enhancement is inhibited by P05121 . By using specific P05121 mutants with either VN binding or plasminogen activator ( PA ) inhibiting activities ablated , we have shown that the P05121 -mediated interference with insulin signaling occurs through its direct interaction with VN , and not through its PA neutralizing activity . Moreover , using cells deficient for uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) we have demonstrated that the inhibition of P05121 on insulin signaling is independent of Q03405 -VN binding . These results constitute the first demonstration of the interaction of P05121 with the insulin response .
