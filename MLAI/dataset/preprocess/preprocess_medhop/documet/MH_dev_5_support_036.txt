P15941 expression is repressed by protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription-y . Mucin 1 ( P15941 ) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that modulates the interaction between the embryo and the uterine epithelial cell surface . P15941 also is a tumor marker and has been implicated in the protection of cancer cells from immune cell attack as well as in cell signaling in some tumors . We and others have shown that P15941 expression is activated by progesterone ( P ) , P01375 , and interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . Here we demonstrate that P15941 expression is down-regulated by overexpression of members of the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription ( PIAS ) family , O75925 , Q9Y6X2 , PIASxalpha , PIASxbeta , and Q8N2W9 , in human uterine epithelial cell lines DB09106 and O14777 -1A and in a breast cancer cell line , T47D . Treatments with P , P01375 , and P01579 were unable to overcome the repression by Q8N2W9 . Q8N2W9 repression of basal , P- , and P01375 -stimulated P15941 promoter activity was not dependent on the Q8N2W9 sumoylation domain . In contrast , Q8N2W9 suppression of P01579 -activated P15941 promoter activity was dependent on the Q8N2W9 sumoylation domain . Q8N2W9 and P receptor B were localized to the nucleus upon P treatment , and small interfering RNA knockdown of Q8N2W9 resulted in an increase in P-mediated stimulation of P15941 protein expression . Overexpression of Q8N2W9 did not affect P receptor B binding to the P15941 promoter but surprisingly led to a loss of nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) , which was recruited to the promoter in response to P. Collectively , these data indicate that Q8N2W9 may be a useful target for down-regulation of P15941 expression in various contexts .
