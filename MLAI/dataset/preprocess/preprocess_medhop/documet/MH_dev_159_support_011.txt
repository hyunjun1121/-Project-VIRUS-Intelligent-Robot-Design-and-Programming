DB01017 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro through the translational suppression of HIF-1α . DB01017 was recently found to be effective against cancer . However , the precise molecular mechanisms of minocycline in cancer are poorly understood . Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( Q9BYW2 , a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIF-1α and β ) activates the transcription of genes that are involved in angiogenesis in cancer . In this study , we found that minocycline significantly inhibits HIF-1α protein expression and suppresses Q9BYW2 transcriptional activity . The tube formation assay showed that minocycline has anti-angiogenic activity and suppresses hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) expression . The metabolic labeling assay showed that minocycline reduces HIF-1α protein translation and global protein synthesis . In addition , minocycline suppresses P42345 signaling and increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α , which is known to be related to the translational regulation of HIF-1α expression . These findings collectively indicate that minocycline is a potential inhibitor of HIF-1α and provide new insight into the discovery of drugs for cancer treatment .
