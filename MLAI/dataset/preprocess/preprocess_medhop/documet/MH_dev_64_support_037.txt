DB08916 circumvents multidrug resistance via dually inhibiting DB00171 binding cassette subfamily G member 2 in vitro and in vivo . Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) to chemotherapeutic drugs is a formidable barrier to the success of cancer chemotherapy . Expressions of DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) transporters contribute to clinical MDR phenotype . In this study , we found that afatinib , a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) targeting P00533 , HER-2 and HER-4 , reversed the chemoresistance mediated by Q9UNQ0 in vitro , but had no effect on that mediated by multidrug resistance protein P08183 and P33527 . In addition , afatinib , in combination with topotecan , significantly inhibited the growth of Q9UNQ0 - overexpressing cell xenograft tumors in vivo . Mechanistic investigations exhibited that afatinib significantly inhibited ATPase activity of Q9UNQ0 and downregulated expression level of Q9UNQ0 , which resulted in the suppression of efflux activity of Q9UNQ0 in parallel to the increase of intracellular accumulation of Q9UNQ0 substrate anticancer agents . Taken together , our findings may provide a new and useful combinational therapeutic strategy of afatinib with chemotherapeutical drug for the patients with Q9UNQ0 overexpressing cancer cells .
