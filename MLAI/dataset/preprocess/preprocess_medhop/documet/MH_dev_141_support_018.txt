Targeted treatment of advanced and metastaticbreast cancer with lapatinib . Improved molecular understanding of breast cancer in recent years has led to the discovery of important drug targets such as HER-2 and P00533 . DB01259 is a potent dual inhibitor of HER-2 and P00533 . Preclinical and phase I studies have shown activity with lapatinib in a number of cancers , including breast cancer , and the drug is well tolerated . The main known drug interactions are with paclitaxel and irinotecan . The most significant side-effects of lapatinib are diarrhea and adverse skin events . Rates of cardiotoxicity compare favorably with trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody against HER-2 . This paper focuses on lapatinib in advanced and metastatic breast cancer , which remains an important therapeutic challenge . Phase II and III studies show activity as monotherapy , and in combination with chemotherapy or hormonal agents . Results from these studies suggest that the main benefit from lapatinib is in the HER-2 positive breast cancer population . Combinations of lapatinib and trastuzumab are also being studied and show encouraging results , particularly in trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer . DB01259 may have a specific role in treating HER-2 positive CNS metastases . The role of lapatinib as neoadjuvant therapy and in early breast cancer is also being evaluated .
