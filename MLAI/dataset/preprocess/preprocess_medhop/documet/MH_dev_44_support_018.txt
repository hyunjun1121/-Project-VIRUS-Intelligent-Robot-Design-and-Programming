P00797 -angiotensin system modulation : the weight of evidence . Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is considered to be the most complete way to manage high-risk patients including those with hypertension . P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitors are effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with overt clinical heart failure , asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction , and uncomplicated myocardial infarction . Furthermore , recent trials like the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluations ( HOPE ) study and the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with DB00790 in stable coronary Artery disease ( EUROPA ) support extending the use of P12821 inhibitors to the routine/first-line treatment of patients with an increased global cardiovascular risk . Although some investigators have seen the development of angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ) as a more effective and tolerable way of reproducing the benefits of P12821 inhibition , there remain important concerns regarding the distinct pharmacologic profiles and modes of action of these two classes of drugs . Careful evaluation of data from recent large-scale studies revealed that , unlike P12821 inhibitors , ARBs are either neutral or may actually increase rates of myocardial infarction despite similar levels of blood pressure reduction . The fact that this effect is most apparent when ARBs are compared with placebo in the absence of concomitant P12821 inhibitors suggests that differential effects on the angiotensin II type 2 ( AT(2) ) receptors may be important . Other important pharmacologic differences are also known to be present and may be of direct relevance . The weight of available evidence therefore supports the use of appropriate P12821 inhibitor regimens , although not ARBs , in the treatment of global cardiovascular risk .
