Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity by trandolapril after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats . We investigated whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor could inhibit matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activities in cerebral infarct lesions after middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) in rats . After placebo or trandolapril ( 5 mg/kg per day ) was administered orally for 7 days , we permanently occluded the right middle cerebral artery . P12821 activity in extracts from the infarct side of placebo-treated rats was significantly higher than that in extracts from the non-infarct side from 5 days after MCAO , though they did not differ at 1 day . P12821 activities in extracts from both hemispheric segments in the trandolapril-treated group were significantly decreased compared with those in the placebo-treated group before MCAO , and this significant reduction persisted even at 7 days after MCAO . In the placebo-treated group , P14780 and P08253 activities in the infarct side were significantly increased at 12 h and at 1 day after MCAO , respectively . DB00519 treatment significantly reduced P14780 and P08253 activities to 68.5 % and 53.2 % , respectively . Seven days after MCAO , the ratios of infarct areas to the hemispheric sectional areas in placebo- and trandolapril-treated rats were 55.4+/-2.1 % and 30.9+/-2.9 % , respectively , and this difference was significant . Neurological severity scores were significantly improved from 1 to 7 days after MCAO in trandolapril-treated rats . Cumulative survival in trandolapril-treated rats was significantly increased compared with that in placebo-treated rats . Thus , the inhibition of P14780 by trandolapril might be part of the mechanism that prevents cerebral damage after cerebral ischemia .
