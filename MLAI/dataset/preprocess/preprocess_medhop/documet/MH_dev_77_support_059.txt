Comparative role of neurotoxin-associated proteins in the structural stability and endopeptidase activity of botulinum neurotoxin complex types A and E . Seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxins , the most toxic substances known to mankind , are each produced by different strains of Clostridium botulinum along with a group of neurotoxin-associated proteins ( NAPs ) . NAPs play a critical role in the toxicoinfection process of botulism in addition to their role in protecting the neurotoxin from proteolytic digestion in the GI tract as well as from adverse environmental conditions . In this study we have investigated the effect of temperature on the structural and functional stability of DB00083 complex ( BoNT/AC ) and BoNT/E complex ( BoNT/EC ) . Although the NAPs in the two complexes are quite different , both groups of NAPs activate the endopeptidase activities of their BoNTs without any need to reduce the disulfide bonds between light and heavy chains of respective BoNTs . BoNT/AC attains optimum enzyme activity at the physiological temperature of 37 degrees C whereas BoNT/EC is maximally active at 45 degrees C , and this is accompanied by conformational alterations in its polypeptide folding at this temperature , leading to favorable binding with its intracellular substrate , P60880 , and subsequent cleavage of the latter . DB00083 in its complex form is found to be structurally more stable against temperature whereas BoNT/E in its complex form is functionally better protected against temperature . Based on the analysis of isolated NAPs we have observed that the structural stability of the BoNT/AC is contributed by the NAPs . In addition to the unique structural conditions in which the enzyme remains active , functional stability of botulinum neurotoxins against temperature plays a critical role in the survival of the agent in cooked food and in food-borne botulism .
