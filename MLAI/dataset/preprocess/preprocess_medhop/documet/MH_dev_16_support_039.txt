P51955 mediates P00352 -dependent drug resistance in multiple myeloma . We reported previously that increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( P00352 ) in multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a marker of tumor-initiating cells ( TICs ) that is further associated with chromosomal instability ( Q96GD0 ) . Here we demonstrate that member A1 of the P00352 family of proteins , P00352 , is most abundantly expressed in myeloma . Enforced expression of P00352 in myeloma cells led to increased clonogenicity , tumor formation in mice , and resistance to myeloma drugs in vitro and in vivo . The mechanism underlying these phenotypes included the P00352 -dependent activation of drug-efflux pump , P08183 , and survival proteins , AKT and P10415 . Over expression of P00352 in myeloma cells led to increased mRNA and protein levels of NIMA-related kinase 2 ( P51955 ) , whereas shRNA-mediated knock down of P51955 decreased drug efflux pump activity and drug resistance . The activation of P51955 in myeloma cells relied on the P00352 -dependent generation of the retinoid X receptor α ( RXRα ) ligand , 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9CRA ) - not the retinoic acid receptor α ( RARα ) ligand , all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . These findings implicate the P00352 -RXRα- P51955 pathway in drug resistance and disease relapse in myeloma and suggest that specific inhibitors of P00352 are worthy of consideration for clinical development of new approaches to overcome drug resistance in myeloma .
