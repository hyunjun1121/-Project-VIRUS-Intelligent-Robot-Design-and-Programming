Effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands , bezafibrate and fenofibrate , on adiponectin level . OBJECTIVE : Q15848 is adipose-specific secretory protein and acts as anti-diabetic and anti-atherosclerotic molecule . We previously found peroxisome proliferators response element in adiponectin promoter region , suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) ligands elevate adiponectin . Fibrates are known to be PPARalpha ligands and were shown to reduce risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease . Effect of fibrates on adiponectin has not been clarified , whereas thiazolidinediones enhance adiponectin . Thus , we explored the possibility and mechanism that fibrates enhance adiponectin in humans , mice , and cells . METHODS AND RESULTS : Significant increase of serum adiponectin was observed in bezafibrate-treated subjects compared with placebo group in patients enrolled in The DB01393 Infarction Prevention study . Higher baseline adiponectin levels were strongly associated with reduced risk of new diabetes . Fibrates , bezafibrate and fenofibrate , significantly elevated adiponectin levels in wild-type mice and 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Such an effect was not observed in PPARalpha-deficient mice and adipocytes . Fibrates activated adiponectin promoter but failed to enhance its activity when the point mutation occurred in peroxisome proliferators response element site and the endogenous PPARalpha was knocked down by PPARalpha-RNAi . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that fibrates enhance adiponectin partly through adipose PPARalpha and measurement of adiponectin might be a useful tool for searching subjects at high risk for diabetes .
