Regulation of alpha-synuclein expression by liver X receptor ligands in vitro . P37840 is a lipid-binding protein expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes which is increased in Parkinson 's disease . We identified two putative liver X receptor ( LXR ) response elements in the human alpha-synuclein gene and used synthetic ( TO901317 , GW3695 ) and physiological ( 27-hydroxycholesterol ) LXR activators to assess regulation of alpha-synuclein . LXR ligands upregulated alpha-synuclein mRNA by two-five-fold in human SK-N-SH neurons and three-six-fold in human Q03405 .13 oligodendrocytes . Significant 50 % to four-fold induction of alpha-synuclein protein was also detected . Under these conditions , mRNA for LXR-responsive gene O95477 was significantly upregulated 15-40-fold and 5-25-fold in neurons and oligodendrocytes , respectively . LXR may , therefore , contribute to the regulation of alpha-synuclein expression in neurons and oligodendrocytes .
