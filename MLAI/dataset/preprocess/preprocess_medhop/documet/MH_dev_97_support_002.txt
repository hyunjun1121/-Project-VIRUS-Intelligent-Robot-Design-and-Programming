Using mass spectrometry to detect , differentiate , and semiquantitate closely related peptide hormones in complex milieu : measurement of P01344 and vesiculin . The search for an islet β-cell growth factor has been a key objective in recent diabetes research , because the ability to regenerate and/or protect the functioning β-cell population in patients could result in a great advancement for diabetes treatment . P05019 and P01344 are known to play crucial roles in fetal growth and prenatal development , and there is growing evidence that P01344 increases β-cell proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo . A search for the source of P01344 -like immunoreactivity in isolated β-cell secretory granules from the murine cell line βTC6- P08709 revealed a novel 2-chain P01344 -derived peptide , which we named vesiculin and which has been shown to be a full insulin agonist . Here , we present a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method that enables selective detection and semiquantitation of the highly related P01344 and vesiculin molecules . We have used this method to measure these 2 peptides in conditioned media from 2 β-cell lines , produced under increasing glucose concentrations . This technique detected both P01344 and vesiculin in media conditioned by MIN6 and βTC6- P08709 cells at levels in the range of 0 to 6 μM ( total insulin , 80-450 μM ) and revealed a glucose-stimulated increase in insulin , P01344 , and vesiculin . P01344 was detected in adult human and neonatal mouse serum in high levels , but vesiculin was not present . The methodology we present herein has utility for detecting and differentiating active peptides that are highly related and of low abundance .
