A novel strategy for the generation of angiostatic kringle regions from a precursor derived from plasminogen . In this study we have explored the feasibility of generating angiostatin by incorporating an endoproteolytic furin cleavage site into plasminogen to allow conversion of the precursor molecule into an angiostatic active P04264 -3 fragment . We show that secretable angiostatin can be successfully generated from cells infected with adenovirus carrying the furin-mutated plasminogen ( AdmuthPlgK3 ) . Supernatant from cells transduced with AdmuthPlagK3 inhibits tube formation and proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with an efficiency similar to that of supernatant from cells infected with adenovirus expressing kringle 1-3 of plasminogen ( AdK1-3 ) . Administration of AdmuthPlgK3 and AdK1-3 in mice results in significantly decreased endothelial cell infiltration in P15692 -embedded Matrigel plugs . Treatment with AdmuthPlgK3 and AdK1-3 exerts strong antitumoral effect in models of hepatocellular carcinoma and Lewis lung cancer . This antitumor effect was associated with decreased microvessel density in the tumors . Taken together , our data demonstrate that angiostatin endowed with strong antiangiogenic and antitumor effects can be released from a furin-mutated plasminogen acting as a precursor . This strategy may have potential to develop angiostatic anti-cancer therapies .
