The immunological effects of electrolyzed reduced water on the Echinostoma hortense infection in C57BL/6 mice . Electrolyzed reduced water ( ERW ) is widely used for drinking by people in Asia . The purpose of this study was to examine the immunological effect of ERW on the immunity of animals by supplying ERW to C57BL/6 mice infected with Echinostoma hortense metacercariae . In the non-infected groups , interleukin ( IL ) -4 ( p < 0.001 ) , P05113 , P22301 , IL-1beta , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha and immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A expression of the group fed ERW ( ERW group ) increased in small intestine compared with the normal control group . In the case of infected groups , the group fed ERW ( ERW+E. hortense group ) showed the result that P05112 , P05113 , P22301 and Ig A expression increased , but IL-1beta and P01375 ( p < 0.001 ) decreased , and the number of goblet cells ( p < 0.001 ) and helix pomatia agglutinin ( Q9Y251 ) positive cells increased compared with the group without feeding ERW . However , adult worm recovery rate was markedly increased ( p < 0.05 ) . On the other hand , the expression of all the cytokines except P22301 in spleen was mildly increased but not significant statistically , and there was no significant difference in the numerical changes of white blood cell ( WBC ) . These results indicate that feeding ERW may have influence on the local immune response ( Th-1 type cytokines such as IL-1beta , P01375 ) in the small intestine but not on the systemic immune response .
