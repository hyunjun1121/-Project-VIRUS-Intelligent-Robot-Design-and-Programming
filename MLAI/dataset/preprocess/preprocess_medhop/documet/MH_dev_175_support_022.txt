Celecoxib blocks cardiac Kv1.5 , Kv4.3 and Kv7.1 ( P51787 ) channels : effects on cardiac action potentials . Celecoxib is a P35354 inhibitor that has been related to an increased cardiovascular risk and that exerts several actions on different targets . The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of this drug on human cardiac voltage-gated potassium channels ( Kv ) involved on cardiac repolarization Kv1.5 ( I(Kur) ) , Kv4.3+ Q9NS61 ( I(to1) ) and Kv7.1+ P15382 ( I(Ks) ) and to compare with another P35354 inhibitor , rofecoxib . Currents were recorded in transfected mammalian cells by whole-cell patch-clamp . Celecoxib blocked all the Kv channels analyzed and rofecoxib was always less potent , except on Kv4.3+ Q9NS61 channels . Kv1.5 block increased in the voltage range of channel activation , decreasing at potentials positive to 0 mV . The drug modified the activation curve of the channels that became biphasic . Block was frequency-dependent , increasing at fastest frequencies . Celecoxib effects were not altered by DB08837 (out) in R487Y mutant Kv1.5 channels but the kinetics of block were slower and the degree of block was smaller with DB08837 (in) , indicating that celecoxib acts from the cytosolic side . We confirmed the blocking properties of celecoxib on native Kv currents from rat vascular cells , where Kv1.5 are the main contributors ( IC(50)≈ 7 μM ) . Finally , we demonstrate that celecoxib prolongs the action potential duration in mouse cardiac myocytes and shortens it in guinea pig cardiac myocytes , suggesting that Kv block induced by celecoxib may be of clinical relevance .
