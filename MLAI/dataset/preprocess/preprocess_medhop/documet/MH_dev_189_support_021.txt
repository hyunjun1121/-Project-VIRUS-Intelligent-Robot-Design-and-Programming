Imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) enhances mature osteoclast apoptosis and suppresses osteoclast bone resorbing activity . Recent studies have reported that imatinib mesylate , a kinase inhibitor that targets the intracellular tyrosine kinase P11274 - P00519 and the platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor , is an effective inhibitor of the macrophage colony stimulating factor ( P09603 ) receptor , c- P07333 . Given that P09603 signalling through c- P07333 plays an important role in osteoclast biology , we speculated that blocking such a pathway with imatinib may modulate osteoclast activity . Using a cell model of mature rabbit osteoclasts , we thus investigated the effect of imatinib on in vitro osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorbing activity . Our findings demonstrate that imatinib dose-dependently stimulates osteoclast apoptosis , a phenomenon which is blocked by the caspase I inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk . The ability of imatinib to enhance osteoclast cell death was accompanied by a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclast bone resorbing activity . Imatinib was also found to inhibit P09603 -induced osteoclast survival as well as P09603 -induced osteoclast bone resorbing activity , but was without effect on interleukin 1alpha ( IL-1alpha ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand ( O14788 ) -induced inhibition of osteoclasts apoptosis , further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib may affect mature osteoclasts through the inhibition of c- P07333 . Taken together , these results suggest that imatinib could be of clinical value in treating diseases where bone destruction can occur due to excessive P09603 production such as osteoporosis , inflammatory-and tumor-induced osteolysis .
