Engineering the response to vascular injury : divergent effects of deregulated Q01094 expression on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells result in endothelial recovery and inhibition of neointimal growth . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) is expressed locally in the vessel wall after angioplasty and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in endothelial cells ( ECs ) , thereby delaying reendothelialization . Prior studies have shown that direct antagonism of P01375 , using a systemically administered soluble receptor , can enhance endothelial recovery and reduce neointimal thickening . These studies have also shown that downregulation of the transcription factor Q01094 was a key mechanism of P01375 's effect on ECs . We now show that Ad- Q01094 overexpression at sites of balloon injury accelerates functional endothelial recovery , consistent with the prior in vitro findings . Moreover these studies also reveal divergent effects of P01375 and overexpression of Q01094 on ECs versus VSMCs . P01375 exposure of VSMCs had no affect on proliferation or apoptosis , in contrast to the effect seen in ECs . In Ad- Q01094 -transduced VSMCs , however , P01375 -induced marked apoptosis in contrast to the survival effect seen in ECs . Finally , these studies suggest that differential activation of NF-kappaB may play a key role in mediating these opposing effects . Nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB was markedly attenuated in Ad- Q01094 -transduced VSMCs , whereas it remained active in similarly treated ECs when the cells were exposed to P01375 . These studies reveal that overexpression of Ad- Q01094 primes VSMCs to P01375 -induced apoptosis . Furthermore , Q01094 potentiates VSMC death by blocking antiapoptotic signaling pathway through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . The divergent responses of VSMCs and ECs to Q01094 overexpression provide unique therapeutic possibilities : simultaneously targeting the cell cycle of two different cell types , within same tissue microenvironment resulting in opposite and biologically complimentary effects .
