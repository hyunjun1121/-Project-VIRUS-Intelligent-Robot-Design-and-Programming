Targetting esophageal and gastric cancers with monoclonal antibodies . Target therapies and notably monoclonal antibodies are currently being considered for esophageal , gastric , and gastroesophageal junction cancers . P00533 was found to be overexpressed in 60-86 % of gastric or gastroesophageal tumors and in 50-70 % of esophageal cancers . Cetuximab was shown to be a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of ENT neoplasia . These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers . Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported . These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials . Several studies reported P04626 overexpression in gastric cancer ( 7-34 % ) , which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis . DB00072 is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular P04626 domain . The international phase III trial known as ToGA ( DB00072 for Gastric Cancer ) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in P04626 -overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer . Angiogenesis is an essential step in the initial phase of tumorigenesis , and it is normally absent from healthy tissues except for particular physiological situations , such as wound healing . P15692 plays a role in endothelial growth and angiogenesis . DB00112 , a humanized monoclonal anti- P15692 antibody , is currently being studied for gastric cancer . The phase III AVAGAST study , evaluating bevacizumab in association with chemotherapy in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma , did not achieve its primary aim of improved OS in bevacizumab-treated patients .
