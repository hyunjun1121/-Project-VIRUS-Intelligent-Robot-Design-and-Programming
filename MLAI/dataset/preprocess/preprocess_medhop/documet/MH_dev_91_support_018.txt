Role of adhesion glycoproteins P05107 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in complement-mediated reactions of rabbit skin . 1. The role of the adhesion glycoproteins P05107 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) in inflammatory responses produced during a reversed passive Arthus ( RPA ) reaction and induced by zymosan and zymosan-activated plasma ( Q7Z2W4 ) were studied in rabbit skin . 2 . Oedema formation and haemorrhage were quantified by measuring accumulation of 125I-albumin and 111In-labelled red blood cells ( 111In-RBC ) respectively . 3 . Monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) R15.7 ( anti- P05107 ) , administered intravenously , abolished accumulation of 125I-albumin and 111In-RBC in dermal RPA reactions and in response to locally injected zymosan and Q7Z2W4 . 4 . When administered intravenously , the mAb P23921 /1 ( anti- P05362 ) suppressed 125I-albumin and 111In-RBC accumulation in dermal RPA reactions and at sites treated with zymosan and Q7Z2W4 . 5 . Oedema formation in response to platelet-activating factor ( Q15004 ) and bradykinin ( BK ) either in the presence or absence of prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) were not affected by mAb R15.7 or by mAb P23921 /1.1.1 . 6 . We conclude that oedema formation and haemorrhage associated with RPA reactions and in responses to zymosan and Q7Z2W4 are completely P05107 -dependent , and are mediated , at least in part , via P05362 . Responses to the neutrophil-independent oedema forming mediators , Q15004 and BK are not dependent upon P05107 or P05362 .
