Acute effects of sarpogrelate , a 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist on cytokine production in endotoxin shock model of rats . Serotonin ( 5-HT ) (2A) receptors are involved in cytokine production in infection or sepsis . Therefore , 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist might be useful to treat sepsis . The present study investigates the effects of a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist , sarpogrelate on endotoxin shock . Catheters were inserted into the femoral artery and vein of Sprague-Dawley rats . First , sarpogrelate 0 ( control ) , 3 , or 10 mg/kg dissolved in 0.5 ml of distilled water has been given , followed by endotoxin 10 mg/kg in saline 0.5 ml 5 min later . Blood pressure , pulse rate and survival rate were monitored in 20 rats per dose . Blood gas and plasma cytokine concentrations were measured in 8 rats per dose . In four rats each of sarpogrelate 0 , 3 , or 10 mg/kg , and sham operation , the lung histology was examined . Zero , 15 , and 12 rats survived for 8 h in the control , 3 mg/kg , and 10 mg/kg groups , respectively . The control group had the lowest blood pressure , pulse rate , pH and arterial oxygen tension , and the highest arterial carbon dioxide tension and plasma IL-1beta concentration . The increase of P01375 was significantly lower in 3 mg/kg group than in the control group . Pathological changes of the lung were inhibited in 3 and 10 mg/kg groups . In conclusion , sarpogrelate might be effective to decrease production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , to keep hemodynamics , to inhibit lung damage , and to decrease mortality in endotoxin shock .
