Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the postnatal rat results in decreased cell proliferation in the renal outer medulla . 1. Chronic angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibition or AT1 antagonism during postnatal development in the rat has been shown to cause renal tubular and vascular damage , particularly in the outer medulla . 2 . The effects of P12821 inhibition were investigated at a stage of development before the renal outer medulla is fully established . 3 . Sprague-Dawley rat pups were given daily i.p. injections of either enalapril or saline from days 3-10 . At day 11 , kidneys were perfusion-fixed for either electron microscopy or immunocytochemistry . Sections were incubated in proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) antisera and the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to detect an immunoreactive product , indicative of proliferating cells . 4 . Following enalapril treatment , the normal structural arrangement of the outer medulla was disrupted compared with controls . Cell proliferation ( P12004 -positive cells ) in the medullary rays was reduced in enalapril-treated kidneys compared with control kidneys . 5 . Thus , angiotensin II appears to be essential for normal tubular and vascular growth in postnatal renal development in the rat .
