Inhibition of the trigemino-vascular system with P28221 agonist drugs : selectively targeting additional sites of action . Inappropriate activation of the trigemino-vascular system is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of a migraine attack . The P28221 agonist sumatriptan , which is highly effective in the acute treatment of migraine , inhibits trigemino-vascular activation in animals , although its actions are normally limited to peripheral components of the trigemino-vascular system . DB00315 , a novel P28221 agonist drug , which is also highly effective in the acute treatment of migraine , acts not only at these sites , but , additionally within the brainstem , inhibiting trigemino-vascular activation centrally as well as peripherally . This article describes the pre-clinical development of DB00315 and considers , specifically , the approaches taken in the design of a molecule with attributes which facilitate access to brainstem components of the trigeminal pathway and combine this with good oral bioavailability .
