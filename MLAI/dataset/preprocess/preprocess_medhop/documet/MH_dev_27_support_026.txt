Enhanced sensitivity to irinotecan by Cdk1 inhibition in the p53-deficient HT29 human colon cancer cell line . Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been associated with advanced colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . DB00762 ( CPT-11 ) , a P11387 inhibitor , has been recently incorporated to the adjuvant therapy . Since the DNA-damage checkpoint depends on p53 activation , the status of p53 might critically influence the response to CPT-11 . We analysed the sensitivity to CPT-11 in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 ( mut p53 ) and its wild-type (wt)-p53 stably transfected subclone HT29-A4 . Cell-cycle analysis in synchronised cells demonstrated the activation of transfected wt-p53 and a P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1)-dependent cell-cycle blockage in the S phase . Activated wt-p53 increased apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to CPT-11 . In p53-deficient cells , cDNA-macroarray analysis and western blotting showed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1/cyclin B complex . Subsequent p53-independent activation of the cdk-inhibitor ( cdk-I ) P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) prevented cell-cycle progression . Cdk1 induction was exploited in vivo to improve the sensitivity to CPT-11 by additional treatment with the cdk-I P99999 -202 . We demonstrate a gain of sensitivity to CPT-11 in a p53-mutated colon cancer model either by restoring wild-type p53 function or by sequential treatment with cdk-Is . Considering that mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC , a therapeutic approach specifically targeting p53-deficient tumors could greatly improve the treatment outcomes .
