No contractile effect for P28221 and P30939 receptor agonists in human and bovine cerebral arteries : similarity with human coronary artery . 1. Using subtype-selective 5-HT1 receptor agonists and/or the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist GR127935 , we characterized in vitro the 5-HT receptor that mediates the contraction of human and bovine cerebral arteries . Further , we investigated which sumatriptan-sensitive receptors are present in human coronary artery by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . 2 . Agonists with affinity at the P28222 receptor , such as sumatriptan , alniditan and/or IS-159 , elicited dose-dependent contraction in both human and bovine cerebral arteries . They behaved as full agonists at the sumatriptan-sensitive 5-HT1 receptors in both species . In contrast , PNU-109291 and LY344864 , selective agonists at P28221 and P30939 receptors , respectively , were devoid of any significant vasocontractile activity in cerebral arteries , or did not affect the sumatriptan-induced vasocontraction . The rank order of agonist potency was similar in both species and could be summarized as 5-HT = alniditan > sumatriptan = IS-159 >>> PNU-109291 = LY344864 . 3 . In bovine cerebral arteries , the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist GR127935 dose-dependently inhibited the vasoconstrictions elicited by both 5-HT and sumatriptan , with respective pA2 values of 8.0 and 8.6 . 4 . RT-PCR studies in human coronary arteries showed a strong signal for the P28222 receptor while message for the P30939 receptor was weak and less frequently detected . Expression of P28221 receptor mRNA was not detected in any sample . 5 . The present results demonstrate that the DB00669 -induced contraction in brain vessels is mediated exclusively by the P28222 receptor , which is also present in a majority of human coronary arteries . These results suggest that selective P28221 and P30939 receptor agonists might represent new antimigraine drugs devoid of cerebro- and cardiovascular effects .
