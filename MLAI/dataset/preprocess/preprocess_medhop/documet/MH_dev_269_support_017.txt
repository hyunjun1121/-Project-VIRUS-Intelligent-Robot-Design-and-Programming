Evaluation of cytokine production by equine alveolar macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide , Aspergillus fumigatus , and a suspension of hay dust . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate cytokine production by equine alveolar macrophages after exposure to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , Aspergillus fumigatus , and hay dust , and determine the effect of clenbuterol on the cytokine response . ANIMALS : 6 horses . PROCEDURE : Alveolar macrophages were exposed to PBS solution ( negative control ) , LPS , hyphae and conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus ( AF ) , or a suspension of hay dust ( Q86SQ9 ) and incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C . Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha and interleukin ( IL ) -1beta were measured in the supernatant . The procedure was repeated with cells that were concurrently incubated with 0.5 microM clenbuterol . RESULTS : Exposure to Q86SQ9 and AF significantly increased production of P01375 by equine alveolar macrophages . The increase in P01375 produced in response to Q86SQ9 and AF was 5 and 7 times as great , respectively , as the increase measured in response to LPS . The concentration of IL-1beta in the supernatant was significantly increased after exposure of cells to AF . DB01407 was effective at inhibiting P01375 production by cells exposed to LPS , Q86SQ9 , or AF . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Increased production of P01375 and IL-1 indicated that the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by alveolar macrophages in response to allergens may play a role in recurrent airway obstruction ( O75106 ) in horses . Equine alveolar macrophages are not only a primary pulmonary defense mechanism but may also influence the pathogenesis of equine O75106 . The beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol , a drug that is commonly used for treatment of equine O75106 , promotes immediate bronchodilation and may also contribute to downward modulation of the inflammatory response .
