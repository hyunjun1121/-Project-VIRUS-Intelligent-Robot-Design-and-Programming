Effects of chronic ' Binge ' cocaine administration on plasma DB01285 and corticosterone levels in mice deficient in Q9UD71 . The product of the Q9UD71 gene mediates intracellular signals initiated by the binding of dopamine to its receptors . Cocaine administration leads to increased activation of dopamine receptors , and causes activation of the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis . We determined the effects of chronic ' binge ' pattern cocaine on Q9Y251 activity in mice containing a targeted disruption of the Q9UD71 gene . Mice received three daily injections of cocaine ( 15 mg/kg/injection ) for 14 days , and were sacrificed 30 min after the last injection . We measured the levels of plasma adrenocorticotropin ( DB01285 ) and corticosterone which reflect Q9Y251 activity . In wild-type controls , ' binge ' cocaine administration significantly increased plasma DB01285 and corticosterone levels . In contrast , Q9UD71 -deficient mice failed to show a significant elevation of either plasma DB01285 or corticosterone levels following ' binge ' cocaine . The results indicate that Q9UD71 plays a role in mediating the stimulatory effects of cocaine on the Q9Y251 axis .
