Antimetastatic potential of vernolide-A , a sesquiterpenoid from Vernonia cinerea L . The inhibitory effect of vernolide-A ( C(21)H(28)O(7) ) on lung metastasis induced by B16F-10 melanoma cells was studied using C57BL/6 mice . Vernolide-A was administered in three different modalities such as simultaneously with tumor , prophylactic to tumor and after tumor development . Maximum inhibition in the metastasis was observed when vernolide-A was administered simultaneously with tumor . There was 89.39 % inhibition of lung tumor nodule formation and 88.51 % increase in the life span of metastatic tumor-bearing animals . Highly elevated levels of lung hydroxyproline , lung uronic acid , lung hexosamine , serum sialic acid , serum Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase ( P19440 ) and serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in the metastatic control animals were found to be significantly lowered in the vernolide-A-treated animals . Histopathological analysis of lung tissues also correlated with these results . Vernolide-A administration downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) , P14780 , extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-1 ( P27361 ) , P28482 and P15692 in the lung tissue of B16F-10 melanoma challenged animals . In the in vitro system , vernolide-A showed a significant inhibition of invasion of B16F-10 melanoma cells across the collagen matrix . Vernolide-A treatment also inhibited the migration of B16F-10 melanoma cells across a polycarbonate filter in vitro . Vernolide-A could inhibit P08253 and P14780 protein expression in gelatin zymographic analysis of B16F-10 cells . (3)H-thymidine proliferation assay showed that vernolide-A could inhibit the proliferation of B16F-10 melanoma cells in vitro . These results indicate that vernolide-A could inhibit the metastatic progression of B16F-10 melanoma cells in mice .
