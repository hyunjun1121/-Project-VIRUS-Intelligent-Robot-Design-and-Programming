Lack of endothelial nitric oxide synthase aggravates murine pneumococcal meningitis . DB00435 ( NO ) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis . However , the role of NO produced by endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) in meningitis is still unclear . We investigated the influence of P29474 depletion on the inflammatory host response , intracranial complications , and outcome in experimental pneumococcal meningitis . Leukocyte accumulation in the cerebrospinal fluid was more pronounced in infected P29474 -deficient mice than in infected wild type mice . This effect could be attributed to an increased expression of P16109 , macrophage inflammatory protein-2 , keratinocyte-derived cytokine , and interleukin ( IL ) -1beta in the brain of infected P29474 -deficient mice . However , no differences in the cerebral expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and P05231 as well as of neuronal NOS and inducible NOS could be detected between infected wild type and mutant mice . In addition to enhanced leukocyte infiltration into the P04141 , meningitis-associated intracranial complications including blood-brain barrier disruption and the rise in intracranial pressure were significantly augmented in infected P29474 -deficient mice . The aggravation of intracranial complications was paralleled by a worsening of the disease , as evidenced by a more pronounced hypothermia , an enhanced weight reduction , and an increased death rate . The current data indicate that P29474 deficiency is detrimental in bacterial meningitis . This effect seems to be related to an increased expression of ( certain ) cytokines/chemokines and adhesion molecules ; thus leading to increased meningeal inflammation and , subsequently , to aggravated intracranial complications .
