Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates membrane lipid synthesis through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins . We analyzed the transcriptional program elicited by stimulation of normal human fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) using cDNA microarrays . 103 significantly regulated transcripts that had not been previously linked to PDGF signaling were identified . Among them , a cluster of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis , including stearoyl- DB01992 desaturase ( O00767 ) , fatty acid synthase , and hydroxymethylglutaryl- Q13057 ( Q01581 ) , was up-regulated by PDGF after 24 h of treatment , and their expression correlated with increased membrane lipid production . These genes are known to be controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins ( SREBP ) . PDGF increased the amount of mature P36956 and regulated the promoters of O00767 and Q01581 in an SREBP-dependent manner . In line with these results , blocking SREBP processing by addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol blunted the effects of PDGF on lipogenic enzymes . SREBP activation was dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , as judged from the effects of the inhibitor LY294002 and mutation of the PDGFbeta receptor tyrosines that bind the PI3K adaptor subunit p85 . Fibroblast growth factors ( P09038 and P08620 ) and other growth factors mimicked the effects of PDGF on NIH3T3 and human fibroblasts . In conclusion , our results suggest that growth factors induce membrane lipid synthesis via the activation SREBP and PI3K .
