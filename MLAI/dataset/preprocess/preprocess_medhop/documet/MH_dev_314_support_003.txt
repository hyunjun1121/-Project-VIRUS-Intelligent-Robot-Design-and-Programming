Identification of immunodominant T cell epitopes of human glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 by using HLA-DR(alpha1*0101,beta1*0401) transgenic mice . DB00142 decarboxylase isoform 2 ( Q05329 ; EC 4.1.1.15 ) has been identified as a key target autoantigen of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) . IDDM is genetically associated with the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) , and particular alleles from the HLA-DQ and HLA-DR loci contribute to disease . Among DR4 subtypes , HLA- Q8IUH3 *0401 , HLA- Q8IUH3 *0402 , and HLA- Q8IUH3 *0405 alleles lend susceptibility , while HLA- Q8IUH3 *0403 confers protection . We have utilized HLA-DR(alpha1*0101,beta1*0401) ( hereafter referred to as DR0401 ) , human P01730 , murine class II null triple transgenic mice and recombinant Q05329 to generate T cell hybridomas , and we have used overlapping sets of peptides to map the immunodominant epitopes of this autoantigen . We have identified 10 immunogenic regions for Q05329 , of which 6 are recognized by multiple hybridomas . These epitopes are also generated by human antigen-presenting cells and their presentation is DR0401 restricted , as shown by the use of typed human lymphoblastoid cell lines and antibody blocking experiments . Immunodominant Q05329 epitopes defined in transgenic mice correspond to Q05329 regions previously shown to elicit T cell responses specifically in DR0401 IDDM patients , underscoring the validity of this approach . Interestingly , although the major epitopes contain DR0401 binding motifs , one of the epitopes contains a DR0405 motif .
