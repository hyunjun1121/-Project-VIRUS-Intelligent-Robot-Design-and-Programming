P01308 is involved in transcriptional regulation of NKCC and the P13569 Cl(-) channel through PI3K activation and P29323 inactivation in renal epithelial cells . It is is well known that insulin stimulates glucose transport and epithelial Na(+) channel ( ENaC ) -mediated Na(+) reabsorption ; however , the action of insulin on Cl(-) secretion is not fully understood . In this study , we investigated the action of insulin on Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter ( NKCC ) -mediated Cl(-) secretion in epithelial A6 cells . Interestingly , insulin treatment remarkably enhanced the forskolin-stimulated Cl(-) secretion associated with an increase in apical Cl(-) conductance by upregulating mRNA expression of both P13569 and NKCC , although insulin treatment alone had no effect on the basal Cl(-) secretion or apical Cl(-) conductance without forskolin application . We next elucidated a role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) in the insulin-induced enhancement of the Cl(-) secretion , since insulin actually activated PI3K , resulting in activation of Akt , a downstream molecule of PI3K . LY294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) reduced the Cl(-) secretion by suppressing mRNA expression of NKCC , whereas insulin still had a stimulatory action on mRNA expression of P13569 even in the presence of LY294002 . On the other hand , we found that a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) further enhanced the insulin-stimulated P13569 mRNA expression and the Cl(-) secretion in forskolin-stimulated A6 cells and that insulin induced slight , transient activation of P29323 followed by significant inactivation of P29323 . These observations suggest that : ( 1 ) insulin respectively upregulates mRNA expression of NKCC and P13569 through activation of PI3K and inactivation of P29323 ; ( 2 ) insulin signals on mRNA expression of NKCC and P13569 are not enough to stimulate transepithelial Cl(-) secretion , but enhance the stimulatory action of DB02527 on transepithelial Cl(-) secretion .
