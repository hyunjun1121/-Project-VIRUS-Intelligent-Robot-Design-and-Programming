Pharmacological investigation of the role of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of experimental NSAID gastropathy . The role of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of acute gastric ulceration induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was investigated using a rat model . One part of the study involved oral pretreatment with a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor 1 h prior to administration of indomethacin ( 20 mg/kg per os ) . Three hours after indomethacin , the extent of macroscopically visible gastric damage was determined , and gastric LTB4 synthesis was determined . The compounds tested were PF-5901 , A-64077 , nordihydroguaiaretic acid , and L-698,037 . Each compound produced dose-related inhibition of gastric LTB4 synthesis and a parallel reduction in the severity of indomethacin-induced damage . The antioxidant properties of these compounds was assessed using an in vitro assay . There was no correlation between the antioxidant properties of the compounds and their ability to reduce the severity of indomethacin-induced gastric damage . In the second part of the study , the effects of intravenous , administration of LTD4 and LTB4 receptor antagonists on indomethacin-induced gastric epithelial damage ( measured by permeability to [51Cr] DB00974 ) were assessed . The two Q9Y271 antagonists ( MK-571 and DB00549 ) significantly reduced the permeability changes induced by indomethacin , while the two LTB4 antagonists ( SC-41930 and LY-255,283 ) were without significant effect . Despite the reduction of gastric epithelial injury , blockade of LTD4 receptors did not markedly affect the extent of macroscopically visible injury . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that leukotrienes contribute to the epithelial injury and macroscopically visible damage induced by NSAIDs . However , it remains unclear to what extent leukotrienes are involved in the initiation of the injury , as opposed to its amplification .
