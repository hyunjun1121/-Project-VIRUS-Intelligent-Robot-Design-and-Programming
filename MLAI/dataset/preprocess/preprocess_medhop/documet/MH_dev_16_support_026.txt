Investigation of the hub genes and related mechanism in ovarian cancer via bioinformatics analysis . BACKGROUND : Ovarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from the ovary . OBJECTIVE : This study was aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of the development and progression of the ovarian cancer . METHODS : We first identified the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between the ovarian cancer samples and the healthy controls by analyzing the GSE14407 affymetrix microarray data , and then the functional enrichments of the DEGs were investigated . Furthermore , we constructed the protein-protein interaction network of the DEGs using the STRING online tools to find the genes which might play important roles in the progression of ovarian cancer . In addition , we performed the enrichment analysis to the PPI network . RESULTS : Our study screened 659 DEGs , including 77 up- and 582 down-regulated genes . These DEGs were enriched in pathways such as Cell cycle , p53 signaling pathway , Pathways in cancer and Drug metabolism . P24864 , O95067 and P20815 were the significant genes identified from these pathways . Protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) network was constructed and network Module A was found closely associated with ovarian cancer . Hub nodes such as P15692 , P62158 , O15392 and P28340 were found in the PPI network . Module A was related to biological processes such as mitotic cell cycle , cell cycle , nuclear division , and pathways namely Cell cycle , Oocyte meiosis and p53 signaling pathway . CONCLUSIONS : It indicated that ovarian cancer was closely associated to the dysregulation of p53 signaling pathway , drug metabolism , tyrosine metabolism and cell cycle . Besides , we also predicted genes such as P24864 , O95067 , P20815 and P15692 might be target genes for diagnosing the ovarian cancer .
