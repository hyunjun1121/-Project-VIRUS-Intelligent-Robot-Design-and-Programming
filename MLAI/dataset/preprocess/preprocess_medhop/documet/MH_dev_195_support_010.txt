Microarray analysis revealed different gene expression patterns in HepG2 cells treated with low and high concentrations of the extracts of Anacardium occidentale shoots . In this study , the effects of low and high concentrations of the Anacardium occidentale shoot extracts on gene expression in liver HepG2 cells were investigated . From MTT assays , the concentration of the shoot extracts that maintained 50 % cell viability ( IC(50) ) was 1.7 mg/ml . Cell viability was kept above 90 % at both 0.4 mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml of the extracts . The three concentrations were subsequently used for the gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Human Genome 1.0 S.T arrays . The microarray data were validated using real-time qRT-PCR . A total of 246 , 696 and 4503 genes were significantly regulated ( P < 0.01 ) by at least 1.5-fold in response to 0.4 , 0.6 and 1.7 mg/ml of the extracts , respectively . Mutually regulated genes in response to the three concentrations included CDKN3 , LOC100289612 , P00374 , Q99986 , Q99741 , Q96GD4 and P78334 . Genes like Q07973 , P38398 , O14965 , P06493 , P24941 , P11802 and P06213 were significantly regulated at 0.6 mg/ml and 1.7 mg but not at 0.4 mg/ml . However , the expression of genes including O75473 , P17936 , P06400 , P14735 , P01130 , P55157 , P04114 , MTIX , P04179 and P08294 were exclusively regulated at the IC(50) concentration . In conclusion , low concentrations of the extracts were able to significantly regulate a sizable number of genes . The type of genes that were expressed was highly dependent on the concentration of the extracts used .
