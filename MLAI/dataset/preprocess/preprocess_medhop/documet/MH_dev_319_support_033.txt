DB00640 A2A receptor : a target for regulating renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy . Renal interstitial fibrosis ( Q9HBH0 ) is the common pathological process of chronic kidney diseases leading inevitably to renal function deterioration . Q9HBH0 and its preceding epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) are commonly triggered by an early occurring renal inflammation . However , an effective approach to prevent EMT and Q9HBH0 is still lacking and of urgent need . Recently , the adenosine A2A receptor ( A2AR ) emerges as a novel inflammation regulator , therefore manipulation of A2AR may suppress the EMT process and as such protect against Q9HBH0 . To test this hypothesis we applied a unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) model of Q9HBH0 on A2AR knockout mice and their wild-type littermates , combined with the intervention of a selective A2AR agonist , CGS 21680 . On days 3 , 7 and 14 post-UUO we evaluated the effects of A2AR manipulation on the molecular pathological progresses of Q9HBH0 , including the cellular component of interstitial infiltration , expression of profibrotic factors , cellular biomarkers of EMT , and collagen deposition of extracellular matrix . Our data demonstrated that activation of A2AR significantly suppressed the deposition of collagen types I and III , reduced the infiltration of P01730 + T lymphocytes , and attenuated the expression of TGF-Î²1 and Q13464 , which in turn inhibited and postponed the EMT progress . Conversely , genetic inactivation of A2AR exacerbated the aforementioned pathological processes of UUO-induced Q9HBH0 . Together , activation of A2AR effectively alleviated EMT and Q9HBH0 in mice , suggesting A2AR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Q9HBH0 .
