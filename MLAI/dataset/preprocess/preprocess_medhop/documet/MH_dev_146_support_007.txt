Fluorescence energy transfer detection as a homogeneous DNA diagnostic method . A homogeneous DNA diagnostic assay based on template-directed primer extension detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer , named template-directed dye-terminator incorporation ( P0CAT3 ) assay , has been developed for mutation detection and high throughput genome analysis . Here , we report the successful application of the P0CAT3 assay to detect mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) gene , the human leukocyte antigen H ( HLA-H ) gene , and the receptor tyrosin kinase ( P07949 ) protooncogene that are associated with cystic fibrosis , hemochromatosis , and multiple endocrine neoplasia , type 2 , respectively . Starting with total human DNA , the samples are amplified by the PCR followed by enzymatic degradation of excess primers and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates before the primer extension reaction is performed . All these standardized steps are performed in the same tube , and the fluorescence changes are monitored in real time , making it a useful clinical DNA diagnostic method .
