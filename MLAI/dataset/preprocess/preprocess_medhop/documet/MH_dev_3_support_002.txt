Q16647 gene transfer inhibits neointimal formation by suppressing Q07869 delta expression . OBJECTIVE : DB01240 ( P06744 (2) ) is a potent ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta ( Q07869 delta ) that regulates cell growth and differentiation . The aim of this study was to elucidate how endogenous P06744 (2) overexpression affects the expressions of Q07869 delta and mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) in the development of neointimal formation in experimental angioplasty with adenovirus-mediated P06744 (2) synthase ( Ad-PGIS ) gene transfer . METHODS AND RESULTS : In human aortic smooth muscle cells , protein blotting analysis showed that P06744 (2) overproduction decreased the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK ( P-p38 MAPK ) ( 2.0-fold versus 0.83-fold relative to control ) . Immunohistochemical analysis in balloon-injured arteries revealed diffuse expression of Q07869 delta in the neointima of control vessels , with no expression in uninjured vessels . The level of Q07869 delta expression was lower in Ad-PGIS-treated arteries than in control vessels , with the Q07869 delta localized in the neointima adjacent to endothelium . Staining of P-p38 MAPK showed a similar pattern to Q07869 delta among the three groups . Morphometric analysis at day 14 revealed that Ad-PGIS reduced the intima-to-media ratio by up to 59 % . CONCLUSIONS : Ad-PGIS gene transfer reduced Q07869 delta expression and inhibited neointimal formation after balloon injury in accordance with the reduction in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK .
