Rational development of DB06681 ( belatacept ) , a high-affinity variant of P16410 -Ig with potent immunosuppressive properties . Current success in organ transplantation is dependent upon the use of calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimens . Unfortunately , current immunotherapy targets molecules with ubiquitous expression resulting in devastating non-immune side effects . T-cell costimulation has been identified as a new potential immunosuppressive target . The best characterized pathway includes P10747 , its homologue P16410 and their ligands P33681 and P42081 . While an immunoglobulin fusion protein construct of P16410 suppressed rejection in rodents , it lacked efficacy in primate transplant models . In an attempt to increase the biologic potency of the parent molecule a novel , modified version of P16410 -Ig , DB06681 ( belatacept ) , was constructed . Two amino acid substitutions ( L104E and A29Y ) gave rise to slower dissociation rates for both P42081 and P33681 . The increased avidity resulted in a 10-fold increase in potency in vitro and significant prolongation of renal allograft survival in a pre-clinical primate model . The use of immunoselective biologics may provide effective maintenance immunosuppression while avoiding the collateral toxicities associated with conventional immunsuppressants .
