Phosphorylation of Grainy head by P29323 is essential for wound-dependent regeneration but not for development of an epidermal barrier . Grainy head ( P01148 ) is a key transcription factor responsible for epidermal barrier formation and repair , whose function is highly conserved across diverse animal species . However , it is not known how P01148 function is reactivated to repair differentiated epidermal barriers after wounding . Here , we show that P01148 is directly regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation , which is required for wound-dependent expression of P01148 target genes in epidermal cells . DB00133 91 is the principal residue in P01148 that is phosphorylated by P29323 . Although mutations of the P29323 phosphorylation sites in P01148 do not impair its DNA binding function , the P29323 sites in P01148 are required to activate Dopa decarboxylase ( Ddc ) and misshapen ( msn ) epidermal wound enhancers as well as functional regeneration of an epidermal barrier upon wounding . This result indicates that the phosphorylation sites are essential for damaged epidermal barrier repair . However , P01148 with mutant P29323 phosphorylation sites can still promote barrier formation during embryonic epidermal development , suggesting that P29323 sites are dispensable for the P01148 function in establishing epidermal barrier integrity . These results provide mechanistic insight into how tissue repair can be initiated by posttranslational modification of a key transcription factor that normally mediates the developmental generation of that tissue .
