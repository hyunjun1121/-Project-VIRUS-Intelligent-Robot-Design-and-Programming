Expression of P10721 and P09619 is associated with a good prognosis in neuroblastoma . BACKGROUND : The clinical outcome of neuroblastoma ( NB ) depends on age , stage , and P04198 amplification . Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) promote cell growth , migration , and metastasis in cancer cells , including NB . However , the correlation of the expression profile of RTKs with prognosis in NB remains controversial . PROCEDURE : Expression and mutation analysis of P10721 , P09619 , P36888 , P07949 , and P04629 mRNAs were performed in 24 NB cell lines and 40 tumor samples using RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing . Immunohistochemical analysis of P10721 and P09619 protein expression was also examined in 38 paraffin sections of NB tumor samples . RESULTS : The expression of P10721 , PDGFRbeta , and P36888 mRNA was associated with NB in patients under 1 year ( P < 0.02 ) and P04629 expression ( P < 0.001 ) . The loss of expression of these kinases was associated with P04198 amplification ( P < 0.02 ) and advanced stages of disease in patients over 1 year of age ( P < 0.005 ) . PDGFRalpha mRNA expression was detected in all cell lines and tumor samples , and P07949 mRNA expression was not associated with any clinical parameters . Immunohistochemistry results showed the similar findings . We did not find any activating mutations in P10721 , P09619 , P36888 , or P07949 . Notably , the GNNK(-) isoform of P10721 was predominant in all cell lines and clinical samples . CONCLUSION : Expression of P10721 , PDGFRbeta , and P36888 was associated with a good prognosis in NB . The loss of expression of these RTKs might correlate to the disease progression of NB .
