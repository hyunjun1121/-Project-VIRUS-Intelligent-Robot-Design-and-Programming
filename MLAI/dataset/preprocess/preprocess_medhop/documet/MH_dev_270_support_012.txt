P06850 knockout inhibits the murine innate immune responses in association with endoplasmic reticulum stress after thermal injury . BACKGROUND : Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated the hypothalamus destruction and adrenalectomy could blunt the innate immunity while boosting the excessive inflammation after injury . We aimed to investigate the effects of corticotrophin-releasing hormone knockout ( P06850 KO ) on the innate immune responses in macrophages as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanism . METHODS : The chemotaxis and phagocytosis activities of macrophages , bacteria translocation , plasma tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α secretion , and intestinal injury were observed in the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum stress after thermal injury in P06850 KO mice . Meanwhile , the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein expression of glucose response protein 78 ( P11021 ) , X-box binding protein 1 ( P17861 ) , and activating transcription factor 6 ( P18850 ) in macrophages was also determined . RESULTS : After thermal injury , the chemotaxis and phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages were increased , which were both reversed by P06850 gene deficiency . The gut-derived bacteria translocation to liver tissues , lung tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes was significantly strengthened in P06850 KO mice compared with P06850 wild-type littermates . Circulating P01375 -α level was increased markedly in response to thermal injury and P06850 KO further increased its secretion . Furthermore , the mRNA and protein levels of P11021 , P17861 , and P18850 in peritoneal macrophages increased , while their expressions in P06850 KO mice all decreased significantly . P06850 KO mice showed enhancement of inflammatory responses and severe tissue injuries after thermal injury . CONCLUSION : P06850 exerted immune defensive actions on immune cells and organs in the early phase of injury , suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are related to endoplasmic reticulum stress .
