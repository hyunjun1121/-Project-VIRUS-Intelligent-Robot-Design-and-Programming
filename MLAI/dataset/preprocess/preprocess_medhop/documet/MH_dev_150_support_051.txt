P10275 signaling induced by supraphysiological doses of dihydrotestosterone in human peripheral blood lymphocytes . Anabolic androgenic steroids , a class of steroid hormones related to testosterone , are natural ligands of androgen receptor ( AR ) , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors . AR binds specific DNA elements , known as androgen-response elements . DB00624 , the main male sexual hormone , binds AR directly and indirectly , through conversion into dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) , its more active metabolite . Anabolic androgenic steroids are frequently detected in the urine of doped athletes ; their consumption is also growing among sport amateurs and adolescents . The effects of androgens can differ depending on the target cells and/or tissues . To gain insight into transcription activation mechanisms of AR , we investigated AR protein signaling in human peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with supraphysiological doses of DB02901 . We performed a comparative proteomic analysis and we identified about 30 differentially expressed proteins . At least five species contained a consensus androgen-response elements sequence in the promoter region of related coding genes . The analysis also revealed that high doses of DB02901 activate the drug detoxification process , could stimulate an increase in cell motility and exert a prosurvival effect rather than an apoptotic one .
