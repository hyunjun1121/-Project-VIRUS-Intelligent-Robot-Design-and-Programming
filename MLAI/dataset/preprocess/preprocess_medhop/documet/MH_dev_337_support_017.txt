Effects of DB00482 and DB00744 on liver metastasis and lipidperoxidation in pancreatic cancer in Syrian hamsters . Selective inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis is thought to have effects on carcinogenesis in lung and colon cancer . However , it is still unknown whether pancreatic cancer might also be influenced . Therefore we evaluated the impact of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor DB00482 and selective P09917 inhibitor DB00744 on liver metastasis in a solid model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in Syrian hamster . In week 33 , the animals were sacrificed and incidence of pancreatic carcinomas and number and size of liver metastases were determined . Activities of antioxidative enzymes ( GSHPX/SOD ) and concentrations of products of lipidperoxidation were measured in liver metastases and non-metastatic hepatic tissue . The incidence ( 54.5 vs. 100 % ) , number ( 3.17 +/- 0.98 vs. 6.75 +/- 0.71 ) and size ( 2.67 +/- 1.97 vs. 11.75 +/- 1.98 mm2 ) of liver metastases were decreased by combined therapy of DB00744 and DB00482 ( P < 0.05 ) . Furthermore , activities of GSHPX ( [ 73.77 +/- 5.67 ] *10(5) vs. [ 15.49 +/- 4.02 ] *10(5) U/mg prot. ; P < 0.05 ) and SOD ( 474.92 +/- 108.8 vs. 127.89 +/- 38.75 U/mg prot. ; P < 0.05 ) were increased , while lipidperoxidation ( 0.31 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg prot. vs. 1.54 +/- 0.55 nmol/mg prot. ; P < 0.05 ) was decreased by combination therapy , in non-metastatic hepatic tissue . Moreover , combined therapy increased lipidperoxidation in liver metastases ( 0.47 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.95 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg prot. ; P < 0.05 ) . Thus , a combination of DB00482 and DB00744 might be a new concept to decrease tumour growth in liver metastases in advanced pancreatic cancer .
