Effects of nasal immunization of multi-target preventive vaccines on atherosclerosis . Previous investigations have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering treatments could be useful for alleviating morbidity and mortality of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases . However , whether a vaccine designed to target inflammation and lipid simultaneously is more powerful to control the process of atherosclerosis remain to be unknown . Here , a vaccine was designed to target heat shock protein-65(Hsp65) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) simultaneously and the effects of nasal immunization of multi-target vaccine on high-cholesterol-diet-driven rabbit atherosclerosis lesions were evaluated . Sera , nasal lavages and lung washes were used to ELISA assay for the analysis of IgG and IgA against Hsp65 and P11597 . Sera were also used to the analysis of the avidity of combination of anti-Hsp65 and anti- P11597 IgG antibodies with corresponding antigen , cytokines P22301 and IFN-γ , and lipoproteins . In addition , aortas were harvested for analysis of atherosclerotic lesions . The results showed that lower and lasting specific anti-Hsp65 IgG and high anti- P11597 IgG in sera and protective anti-Hsp65 and anti- P11597 IgA in nasal cavity and lung were induced , the avidity of combination of anti-Hsp65 and anti- P11597 IgG with antigen were higher , and more protective P22301 and less adverse IFN-γ were produced . In addition , sera TC , and LDL-C were decreased . As a result , the size of aorta atherosclerotic plaques was significantly reduced . We conclude that multifaceted vaccine combining lipid-regulating with anti-inflammation was a potential remedy , especially for atherosclerosis with complicated etiology .
