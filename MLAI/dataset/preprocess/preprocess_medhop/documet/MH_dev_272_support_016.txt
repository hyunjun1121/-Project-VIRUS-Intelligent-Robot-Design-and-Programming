Peripheral endocannabinoid system-mediated actions of rimonabant on growth hormone secretion are ghrelin-dependent . The somatotroph axis is a crucial pathway regulating metabolism . Despite the fact that the endocannabinoid system has been also revealed as a potent modulator of energy homeostasis , little information is available concerning a putative interaction between these two systems . The aim of the present study was to determine the in vivo effects of the blockade of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 ( P21554 ) over growth hormone ( GH ) secretion using the P21554 antagonist rimonabant . The results obtained show that the blockade of the P21554 peripheral receptor by i.p. injection of rimonabant significantly inhibited pulsatile GH secretion . Similarly , it was found that this injection significantly decreased ghrelin-induced GH secretion without any effect on growth hormone-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) -induced GH discharge . In situ hybridisation showed that the peripheral blockade of P21554 did not affect hypothalamic somatostatin mRNA levels ; however , P01286 mRNA expression was significantly decreased . The blockade of the vagus nerve signal by surgical vagotomy eliminated the inhibitory action of rimonabant on P01286 mRNA and consequently on GH . On the other hand , the central P21554 blockade by i.c.v. rimonabant treatment was unable to reproduce the effect of peripheral blockade on P01286 mRNA , nor the GH response to ghrelin . In conclusion , the data reported in the present study establish , from a physiological point of view , the existence of a novel mechanism of GH regulation implicating the action of the cannabinoid receptor on the somatotroph axis .
