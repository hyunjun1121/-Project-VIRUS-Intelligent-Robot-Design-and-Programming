YAP modifies cancer cell sensitivity to P00533 and survivin inhibitors and is negatively regulated by the non-receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase 14 . The Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) is a transcriptional factor involved in tissue development and tumorigenesis . Although YAP has been recognized as a key element of the Hippo signaling pathway , the mechanisms that regulate YAP activities remain to be fully characterized . In this study , we demonstrate that the non-receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase 14 ( Q15678 ) functions as a negative regulator of YAP . We show that YAP forms a protein complex with Q15678 through the WW domains of YAP and the PPXY motifs of Q15678 . In addition , Q15678 inhibits YAP-mediated transcriptional activities . Knockdown of YAP sensitizes cancer cells to various anti-cancer agents , such as cisplatin , the P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib and the small-molecule antagonist of survivin , P28222 . YAP-targeted modalities may be used in combination with other cancer drugs to achieve maximal therapeutic effects .
