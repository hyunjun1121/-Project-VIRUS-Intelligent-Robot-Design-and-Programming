Tetramethoxychalcone , a chalcone derivative , suppresses proliferation , blocks cell cycle progression , and induces apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells . In the present study , we investigated the in vitro antitumor functions of a synthetic chalcone derivative 4,3',4',5'- tetramethoxychalcone ( TMOC ) in ovarian cancer cells . We found that TMOC inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of cisplatin sensitive cell line A2780 and resistant cell line A2780/ DB00515 , as well as ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner . Treatment of A2780 cells with TMOC resulted in G0/ P55008 cell cycle arrest through the down-regulation of cyclin D1 and P11802 , and the up-regulation of p16 , P38936 and p27 proteins . We demonstrated that TMOC might induce cell apoptosis through suppressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , but enhancing the expression of Bax and the cleavage of P09874 . Treatment of TMOC also reduced the invasion and migration of A2780 cells . Finally , we found that TMOC inhibited the constitutive activation of P40763 signaling pathway and induced the expression of the tumor suppressor P60484 regardless of the p53 status in cell lines . These data suggest that TMOC may be developed as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to effectively treat certain cancers including ovarian cancer .
