DAPk1 inhibits NF-κB activation through P01375 -α and P27352 -γ-induced apoptosis . Recent studies have shown DAPk as a molecular modulator induced by the second messenger , responsible for controlling cell destiny decisions , but the detailed mechanism mediating the role of DAPk1 during cell death is still not fully understood . In this present report , we attempted to characterize the effects of P01375 -α and P27352 -γ on DAPk1 in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines , OVCAR-3 . Both P01375 -α and P27352 -γ significantly induce DAPk1 levels in a time-dependent manner . At the same time , they both arrested cell cycle progression in the G(0)-G(1) and G2/M phase , down-regulated cyclin D1 , P11802 and NF-κB expression , while also up-regulating p27 and p16 expression . Subsequently , the efficacy of the combined treatment with DAPk1 was investigated . In the presence of DAPk1 , P01375 -α or P27352 -γ-induced apoptosis was additively increased , while P01375 -α or P27352 -γ-induced NF-κB activity was inhibited . Conversely , P01375 -α or P27352 -γ-dependent NF-κB activity was further enhanced by the inhibition of DAPk1 with its specific siRNA . The activity of NF-κB was dependent on the level of DAPk1 , indicating the requirement of DAPk1 for the activation of NF-κB . Low levels of DAPk1 expression were frequently observed in different human patient 's tissue and cancer cell lines compared to normal samples . In addition , over-expression of DAPk1 from either P01375 -α or P27352 -γ-treatment cells suppressed the anti-apoptosis protein P98170 as well as P35354 and P05362 , more than control . Taken together , our data findings suggest that DAPk1 can mediate the pro-apoptotic activity of P01375 -α and P27352 -γ via the NF-κB signaling pathways .
