Q03181 is up-regulated during vascular lesion formation and promotes post-confluent cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells . Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) delta is widely expressed in many tissues , the role of PPARdelta is poorly understood . In this study , we report that PPARdelta was up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) during vascular lesion formation . By using Northern blot analysis , we demonstrated that PPARdelta was increased by 3-4-fold in VSMC treated with platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( 20 ng/ml ) . In addition , PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression neither needs de novo protein synthesis nor affects the stability of PPARdelta mRNA in VSMC . Preincubation of VSMC with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor ( LY294002 , 50 micromol/liter ) or infection of VSMC with an adenovirus carrying the gene for a dominant negative form of Akt abrogated PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression , suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of PDGF-induced PPARdelta mRNA expression in VSMC . To explore the role of PPARdelta in VSMC , we generated rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( A7r5 ) stably overexpressing PPARdelta and the control green fluorescent protein . Overexpression of PPARdelta in VSMC increased post-confluent cell proliferation by increasing the cyclin A and P24941 as well as decreasing p57(kip2) . Taken together , the results suggest that PPARdelta plays an important role in the pathology of diseases associated with VSMC proliferation , such as primary atherosclerosis and restenosis .
