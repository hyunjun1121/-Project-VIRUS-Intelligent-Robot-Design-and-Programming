Sexually dimorphic stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to an intravenous corticotropin-releasing hormone challenge of Brahman cattle following transportation . This study was designed to characterize potential sexually dimorphic stress and immunological responses following a corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) challenge in beef cattle . Six female ( heifers ) and six male ( bulls ) Brahman calves ( 264 ± 12 d of age ) were administered P06850 intravenously ( 0.5 µg of P06850 /kg body mass ) after which serum concentrations of cortisol increased from 0.5 h to 4 h . From 1 h to 4 h after P06850 administration , serum cortisol concentrations were greater in heifers than in bulls . In all cattle , increased serum concentrations of P01375 -α , P05231 and IFN-γ were observed from 2.5 h to 3 h after P06850 , with greater concentrations of IFN-γ and P05231 in heifers than bulls . Heifer total leukocyte counts decreased 1 h after P06850 administration , while bull leukocyte counts and percent neutrophils decreased 2 h after P06850 administration . Heifers had greater rectal temperatures than bulls , yet rectal temperatures did not change following administration of P06850 . There was no effect of P06850 administration on heart rate . However , bulls tended to have increased heart rate 2 h after P06850 administration than before P06850 . Heifer heart rate was greater than bulls throughout the study . These data demonstrate that acute P06850 administration can elicit a pro-inflammatory response , and cattle exhibit a sexually dimorphic pro-inflammatory cytokine and cortisol response to acute P06850 administration .
