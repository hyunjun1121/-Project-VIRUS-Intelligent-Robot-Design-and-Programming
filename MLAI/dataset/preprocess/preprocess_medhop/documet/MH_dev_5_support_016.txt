Effects of retroviral-mediated P08183 expression on hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in culture . Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells would be useful for bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy applications . Toward this goal , we have investigated whether retrovirally-transduced murine stem cells could be expanded in culture with hematopoietic cytokines . Bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either the human multidrug resistance 1 gene ( HaMDR1 ) , a variant of human dihydrofolate reductase ( HaDHFR ) , or both P08183 and P00374 in an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) -containing bicistronic vector ( HaMID ) . Cells were then expanded for 15 days in cultures stimulated with interleukin ( IL ) -3 , P05231 , and stem cell factor . When very low marrow volumes were injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice , long-term reconstitution with 100 % donor cells was seen in all mice injected with HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced cells . By contrast , engraftment with HaDHFR- or mock-transduced cells ranged from partial to undetectable despite injection of significantly larger marrow volumes . In addition , mice transplanted with expanded HaMDR1- or HaMID-transduced stem cells developed a myeloproliferative disorder that was characterized by an increase in abnormal peripheral blood leukocytes . These results show that P08183 -transduced stem cells can be expanded in vitro with hematopoietic cytokines , but indicate that an increased stem cell division frequency can lead to stem cell damage .
