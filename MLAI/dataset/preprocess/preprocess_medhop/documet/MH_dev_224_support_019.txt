Anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of amlodipine action to improve endothelial cell dysfunction induced by irreversibly glycated LDL . Amlodipine , alone or in combination with other drugs , was successfully used to treat hypertension . Our aim was to evaluate the potential of amlodipine ( Am ) to restore endothelial dysfunction induced by irreversibly glycated low density lipoproteins ( P51606 -LDL ) , an in vitro model mimicking the diabetic condition . Human endothelial cells ( O14777 ) from EA.hy926 line were incubated with P51606 -LDL in the presence/absence of Am and the oxidative and inflammatory status of the cells was evaluated along with the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways . The cellular NADPH activity , 4-hydroxynonenal ( 4-HNE ) and 3-nitrotyrosine levels in the culture medium and the adhesion of human monocytes to O14777 were measured by chemiluminescence , UHPLC , Western Blot and spectrofluorimetric techniques . The gene expression of NADPH subunits ( O75935 (phox) , Q9NPH5 ) , P29474 and inflammatory molecules ( P13500 , P19320 ) were determined by Real Time PCR , while the protein expression of O75935 (phox) , P13500 , P35228 , phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-p65 NF-κB subunit were measured by Western Blot . Results showed that in O14777 incubated with P51606 -LDL , Am led to : ( i ) decrease of the oxidative stress : by reducing O75935 (phox) , Q9NPH5 , P35228 expression , NADPH oxidase activity , 4-HNE and 3-nitrotyrosine levels ; ( ii ) decrease of the inflammatory stress : by the reduction of P13500 and P19320 expression , as well as of the number of monocytes adhered to O14777 ; ( iii ) inhibition of ROS-sensitive signalling pathways : by decreasing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and p65 NF-κB subunits . In conclusion , the reported data demonstrate that amlodipine may improve endothelial dysfunction in diabetes through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms .
