31P- P59665 measurements of extracellular pH of tumors using 3-aminopropylphosphonate . The extracellular pH ( pHex ) of tumors is generally acidic . However , it is only recently that noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopic ( P59665 ) measurements have determined that the intracellular pH ( pHin ) of tumor cells in situ is neutral or slightly alkaline compared with that of normal tissues . Thus cells in tumors maintain larger pH gradients than do cells in nontumor tissues . To date , measurements of pHex in tumors have been made using microelectrodes , which preclude measurement of pHex and pHin within the same preparation . In addition , microelectrodes are invasive and have the potential to alter the measured pH values . The present communication describes simultaneous measurement of pHex and pHin in vitro in bioreactor culture and in vivo using 31P- P59665 analyses of 3-aminopropylphosphonate ( 3- P05067 ) and inorganic phosphate . In vitro results indicate that 3- P05067 is not toxic and that its resonant frequency is sensitive to pH and not significantly affected by temperature or ionic strength . Bioreactor experiments indicate that this compound is neither internalized nor metabolized by cells . Experiments in vivo indicate that 3- P05067 can be administered intraperitoneally and that Q9HBH0 -1 tumors maintain a steady-state pHin of 7.25 and a pHex of 6.66 . These data have significance to basic tumor cell physiology and to the design of approaches to cancer chemotherapy and hyperthermic therapy , because both of these modalities exhibit pH sensitivity . It is also likely that these techniques will be applicable to localized P59665 of other organ systems in vivo .
