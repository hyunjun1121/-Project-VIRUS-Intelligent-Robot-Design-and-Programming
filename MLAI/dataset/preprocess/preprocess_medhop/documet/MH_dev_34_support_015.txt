Genomic structure of murine methylmalonyl- DB01992 mutase : evidence for genetic and epigenetic mechanisms determining enzyme activity . Methylmalonyl- DB01992 mutase ( P22033 ) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix enzyme . We have reported characterization of murine P22033 and cloning of a murine P22033 cDNA and now describe the murine Mut locus , its promoter and evidence for tissue-specific variation in P22033 mRNA , enzyme and holo-enzyme levels . The Mut locus spans 30 kb and contains 13 exons constituting a unique transcription unit . A B1 repeat element was found in the 3' untranslated region ( exon 13 ) . The transcription initiation site was identified and upstream sequences were shown to direct expression of a reporter gene in cultured cells . The promoter contains sequence motifs characteristic of : ( 1 ) TATA-less housekeeping promoters ; ( 2 ) enhancer elements purportedly involved in co-ordinating expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins ; and ( 3 ) regulatory elements including CCAAT boxes , cyclic AMP-response elements and potential P05549 -binding sites . Northern blots demonstrate a greater than 10-fold variation in steady-state mRNA levels , which correlate with tissue levels of enzyme activity . However , the ratio of holoenzyme to total enzyme varies among different tissues , and there is no correlation between steady-state mRNA levels and holoenzyme activity . These results suggest that , although there may be regulation of P22033 activity at the level of mRNA , the significance of genetic regulation is unclear owning to the presence of epigenetic regulation of holoenzyme formation .
