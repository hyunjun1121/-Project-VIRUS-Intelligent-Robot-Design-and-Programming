Effects of lesopitron on the central nervous system arising from its interaction with P08908 receptors . DB04970 acts as a ligand for central serotonin P08908 receptors . Ki obtained from [3H]8-OH-DPAT competition studies was 104.8 +/- 10.6 nmol/l . As lesopitron did not affect the binding of [3H]paroxetine , involvement of the serotonin reuptake system in the effects of lesopitron is rejected . DB04970 inhibits haloperidol-induced catalepsy that is the consequence of its action on P08908 autoreceptors . The ability of lesopitron to induce 5-HT syndrome reflects post-synaptic P08908 receptor activation and the reversion of 8-OHDPAT-induced 5-HT syndrome by lesopitron suggests a partial agonist effect on this receptor-type . DB04970 induced a hypothermic effect due to the enhanced activation of post-synaptic P08908 receptors . The agonist effect of lesopitron on P08908 receptors and its marked hypothermic effect is an added value for this drug and a stimulus to the study of its possible neuroprotective action .
