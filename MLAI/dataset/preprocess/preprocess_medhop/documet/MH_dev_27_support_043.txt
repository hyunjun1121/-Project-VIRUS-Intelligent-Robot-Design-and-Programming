Cardioprotective mechanism of telmisartan via P37231 - P29474 pathway in dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats . BACKGROUND : Recently , some investigators have shown that telmisartan , an angiotensin II ( Ang II ) -receptor blocker ( ARB ) , is a partial agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . We investigate whether telmisartan improves cardiovascular remodeling associated with the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) through P37231 , inhibits the Rho-kinase pathway , and suppresses oxidative stress in Dahl salt-sensitive ( DS ) hypertensive rats . METHODS : Telmisartan ( 1 mg/kg per day ) or telmisartan plus P37231 inhibitor , GW9662 ( 1 mg/kg per day ) was administered from the age of 6-11 weeks . Age-matched male Dahl salt-resistant ( DR ) rats served as a control group . RESULTS : The levels of P29474 and P37231 expression , and P29474 phosphorylation were significantly lower in DS rats than in DR rats . Chronic telmisartan treatment in DS rats significantly increased these parameters , but not telmisartan plus GW9662 . Telmisartan effectively inhibited the vascular lesion formation such as medial thickness and perivascular fibrosis , but not telmisartan plus GW9662 . Moreover , upregulated RhoA protein , Rho-kinase mRNA , and myosin light-chain phosphorylation in DS rats was decreased by telmisartan to a similar degree as observed after treatment with Y-27632 , a selective Rho-kinase inhibitor . In addition , NAD(P)H oxidase P13498 , p47phox , gp91phox expression , and mitogen-activated protein kinase and its downstream effector P08133 S6 kinase phosphorylation in DS rats was also inhibited by telmisartan . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that the cardioprotective mechanism of telmisartan may be partly due to improvement of endothelial function associated with P37231 - P29474 , oxidative stress , and Rho-kinase pathway .
