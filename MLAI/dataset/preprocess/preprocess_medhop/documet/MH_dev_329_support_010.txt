DB00624 stimulates proliferation and inhibits interleukin-6 production of normal and hereditary gingival fibromatosis fibroblasts . Hereditary gingival fibromatosis ( P14210 ) is a rare oral condition characterized by a slow and progressive enlargement of the gingiva , involving both the maxilla and mandible . In vitro , P14210 fibroblasts demonstrate a proliferative index significantly higher than fibroblasts from normal gingiva ( NG ) . The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dihydrotestosterone on the proliferation of gingival fibroblasts derived from patients with P14210 ( n = 4 ) and from four healthy individuals . Additionally , we analyzed the effect of dihydrotestosterone on interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) production and determined the expression levels of androgen receptors in NG and P14210 fibroblasts . Gingival fibroblasts from NG and P14210 were incubated with increasing concentrations of dihydrotestosterone with or without androgen blockers , and cultured for 24 h , and the proliferation index was determined by automated cell counter . P05231 production , in this system , was quantified using a " capture " enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was performed to measure the mRNA expression of androgen receptors . The results indicated that dihydrotestosterone simultaneously downregulates the production of P05231 and upregulates the cell proliferation . DB01216 and cyprosterone acetate , two anti-androgens , partially reversed these effects . P10275 mRNA expression was identified in both NG and P14210 fibroblasts ; however , the levels in NG were higher than those observed in P14210 . These results show that testosterone coordinates the proliferation and production of P05231 of normal and P14210 fibroblasts .
