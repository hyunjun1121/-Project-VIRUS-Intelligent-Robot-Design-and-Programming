Combined environmental risk assessment for 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine in Europe . An environmental risk assessment ( ERA ) was made for the old cytostatic active pharmaceutical ingredient 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) and for capecitabine ( CAP ) , which is a prodrug of DB00544 . This ERA is based on published and company internal data as well as new test results for physicochemical , human metabolism , biodegradability , environmental partitioning and fate , and acute and chronic ecotoxicity properties of the active substance DB00544 as well as on use sales data for DB00544 and CAP in Europe . Predicted environmental concentrations ( PECs ) were extrapolated following the EMEA 2006 Guideline on ERA for human pharmaceuticals and the European Union 2003 Technical Guidance Document ( TGD ) for risk assessment as well as the TGD-based application EUSES v2.0 . Actual amounts sold were taken from IMS Health Databases , in order to refine the default use and EMEA penetration factor as well as the PECs . Moreover , available measured environmental concentrations ( MECs ) were used to supplement PECs . A predicted no-effect concentration ( PNEC ) for DB00544 was derived from chronic ecotoxicity data . Except for the simplistic EMEA Phase I default PEC , the risk characterization by PEC:PNEC and Q9NRJ3 :PNEC ratios for various environmental compartments resulted in no significant risk . As the EMEA Phase I PEC does not integrate documented human metabolism and environmental degradation , in contrast to refined PEC derivations , it is inferred that the current use of CAP and DB00544 does not present any evident risk to the environment . An additional evaluation of persistence , bioaccumulation , and toxicity ( P10721 ) properties supports the conclusion of no significant environmental risk for DB00544 and CAP .
