Anticonvulsant effects of agomelatine in mice . DB06594 is a potent MT1 and P02795 melatonin receptor agonist and a P28335 serotonin receptor antagonist . We analyzed whether agomelatine has anticonvulsant properties . The anticonvulsant activity of agomelatine ( 25 , 50 or 75 mg/kg , i.p. ) was evaluated in mouse models of pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ-85 mg/kg , i.p. ) , pilocarpine ( 400mg/kg , i.p. ) , picrotoxin ( 7 mg/kg , i.p. ) , strychnine ( 75 mg/kg , i.p. ) or electroshock-induced convulsions . In the PTZ-induced seizure model , agomelatine ( at 25 or 50mg/kg ) showed a significant increase in latency to convulsion , and agomelatine ( at 50 or 75 mg/kg ) also increased significantly time until death . In the pilocarpine-induced seizure model , only agomelatine in high doses ( 75 mg/kg ) showed a significant increase in latency to convulsions and in time until death . In the strychnine- , electroshock- and picrotoxin-induced seizure models , agomelatine caused no significant alterations in latency to convulsions and in time until death when compared to controls . Our results suggest that agomelatine has anticonvulsant activity shown in PTZ- or pilocarpine-induced seizure models .
