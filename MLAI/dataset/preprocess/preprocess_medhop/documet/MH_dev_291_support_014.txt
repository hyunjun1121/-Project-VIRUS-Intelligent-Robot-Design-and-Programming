A 3-D model for P08908 -receptor agonists based on stereoselective methyl-substituted and conformationally restricted analogues of 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin . The enantiomers of cis- and trans-1,2,3,4,4a,5,10,10a-octahydro-9-hydroxy-1- propylbenzo[g]quinolines ( 10 and 11 , respectively ) and the enantiomers of trans-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b-octahydro-10- hydroxy-4-propylbenzo[f]quinoline ( 12 ) have been synthesized and their stereochemical and conformational characteristics have been studied by use of X-ray crystallography and molecular mechanics ( P08253 ) calculations . The compounds , which are conformationally restricted analogues of the potent 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2- (dipropylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ; 1 ) have been evaluated for central 5-HT and dopamine receptor stimulating activity by use of biochemical and behavioral tests in rats . In addition , we have evaluated the ability of these compounds and a number of previously reported analogues to displace [ 3H ] -8-OH-DPAT from P08908 -binding sites . The enantiomers of 12 behave as potent P08908 -receptor agonists , whereas the octahydrobenzo[g]quinoline derivatives are much less potent or inactive . In general , the affinities of the compounds correlate well with their agonist potencies . The set of compounds under study is accommodated by a novel computer-graphics-derived model for P08908 -receptor agonism . The model consists of a flexible pharmacophore and a partial receptor-excluded volume .
