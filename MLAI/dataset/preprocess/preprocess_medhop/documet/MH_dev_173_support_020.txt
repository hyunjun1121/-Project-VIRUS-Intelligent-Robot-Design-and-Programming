DB00952 : a review . Even though naratriptan and sumatriptan are both P28222 / P28221 receptor agonists , the biological and pharmacokinetic profile of naratriptan differs significantly from that of sumatriptan . With a plasma half-life of 6 h , very high oral bioavailability of 63-74 % and higher lipophilicity than sumatriptan , naratriptan exhibits a distinct clinical therapeutic profile . The similar tolerability to placebo , prolonged efficacy for 24 h or more and very low headache recurrence rate make naratriptan an attractive option in the treatment of acute migraine .
