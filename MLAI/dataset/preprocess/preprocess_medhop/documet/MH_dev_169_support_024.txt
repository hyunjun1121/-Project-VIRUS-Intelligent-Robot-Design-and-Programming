Delayed immunologic thrombocytopenia induced by abciximab . DB00054 is an anti- P08514 -IIIa drug widely used to prevent thrombotic complications during percutaneous coronary intervention . We now report on the immunologic origin of thrombocytopenia developing between 7 and 12 days after the onset of abciximab infusion . Antibodies directed against abciximabcoated platelets were located in 5 patients with delayed thrombocytopenia , just as they were present in a patient whose platelet count fell within a few hours after receiving the drug . DB00054 -dependent IgG antibody was revealed in serum using control platelets in the monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens assay ( MAIPA ) performed with SZ22 , a MoAb to P08514 . The presence of IgG antibodies specific for platelets sensitized with abciximab was confirmed by flow cytometry . They were not located in 13 patients receiving abciximab but whose platelet counts remained stable . For three patients , antibodies were transient and their presence related to the extent of the thrombocytopenia . Surprisingly , antibodycontaining plasma from three patients induced abciximabdependent activation and aggregation of normal platelets , a finding confirmed by electron microscopy . Immunogold labeling revealed that abciximab was associated with platelets in the aggregate , suggesting that its inhibitory effect was overcome by the platelet stimulation . In summary , these results show that abciximab-dependent thrombocytopenia can be delayed and potentially prothrombotic .
