Inhibition of angiogenesis by vitamin D-binding protein : characterization of anti-endothelial activity of P02774 . Angiogenesis is a complex process involving coordinated steps of endothelial cell activation , proliferation , migration , tube formation and capillary sprouting with participation of intracellular signaling pathways . Regulation of angiogenesis carries tremendous potential for cancer therapy . Our earlier studies showed that vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor ( P02774 ) acts as a potent anti-angiogenic factor and inhibits tumor growth in vivo . The goal of this investigation was to understand the effect of P02774 on human endothelial cell ( O14777 ) and the mechanism of angiogenesis inhibition . P02774 inhibited human endothelial cell ( O14777 ) proliferation by inhibiting DNA synthesis ( IC(50) = 7.8 +/- 0.15 microg/ml ) . P02774 significantly induced S- and G0/ P55008 -phase arrest in O14777 in 72 h . P02774 potently blocked P15692 -induced migration , tube-formation of O14777 in a dose dependent manner . In addition , P02774 inhibited growth factor-induced microvessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay . Moreover , P02774 inhibited P15692 signaling by decreasing P15692 -mediated phosphorylation of P35968 and P27361 /2 , a downstream target of P15692 signaling cascade . However , Akt activation was not affected . These studies collectively demonstrate that P02774 inhibits angiogenesis by blocking critical steps such as O14777 proliferation , migration , tube formation and microvessel sprouting . P02774 exerts its effect by inhibiting VEGR-2 and P27361 /2 signaling cascades . Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-endothelial activity of P02774 will allow us to develop it as an angiogenesis targeting novel drug for tumor therapy .
