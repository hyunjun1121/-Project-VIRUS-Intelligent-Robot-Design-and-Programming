A placebo-controlled , double-blind trial of infliximab for cancer-associated weight loss in elderly and/or poor performance non-small cell lung cancer patients ( N01C9 ) . PURPOSE : This study tested whether infliximab , a chimeric IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha , improves/stabilizes weight loss in elderly and/or poor performance status patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . METHODS : This double-blind trial randomly assigned patients to infliximab/docetaxel ( n=32 ) versus placebo/docetaxel ( n=29 ) . The primary endpoint was > or = 10 % weight gain . RESULTS : Groups were balanced with respect to age , number of prior chemotherapy regimens , baseline weight loss , and performance status . No patient gained > or = 10 % baseline weight , and early evidence of the lack of efficacy prompted early trial closure . Appetite improvement was negligible in both arms . However , infliximab-/docetaxel-treated patients developed greater fatigue and worse global quality of life scores . Other outcomes , such as tumor response rate ( < 10 % in both groups ) and overall survival , were not statistically different between groups . There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events , although one death was attributed to infliximab . Genotyping for the P01375 alpha -238 and -308 polymorphisms revealed no clinical significance of these genotypes , as relevant to the loss of weight or appetite . CONCLUSIONS : This trial closed early because infliximab did not prevent or palliate cancer-associated weight loss . DB00065 was associated with increased fatigue and inferior global quality of life .
