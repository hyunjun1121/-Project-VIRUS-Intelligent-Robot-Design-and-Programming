Activation of caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells by N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine , an inhibitor of arginase , is not solely dependent on reduction in intracellular polyamines . We have shown previously that ( NOHA ) an intermediate in the nitric oxide ( NO ) synthetic pathway and an inhibitor of arginase significantly reduced intracellular polyamines , activated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 . These actions of NOHA were abolished in the presence of exogenous L-ornithine suggesting that a reduction in the intracellular polyamine content might be responsible for the activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic actions of NOHA . In order to further explore this possibility , we used DB00118 -486A and alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DB06243 ) , which are inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( P17707 ) , and ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) , respectively , either alone or in combination to reduce the intracellular polyamine levels . We then assessed whether a reduction in polyamine levels by these two compounds to a similar degree to that produced by NOHA activated caspase-3 which occurs prior to the onset of apoptosis . We observed that both DB00118 -486A and DB06243 , either alone or in combination , inhibited cell proliferation , induced P38936 and arrested cells in the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle but failed to activate caspase-3 as assessed by enzymatic assay of caspase-3 , western blot analysis of the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 protein as well as TUNEL assay . Furthermore , pre-incubation of the cells with DB00118 -486A and DB06243 for 4 days , either alone or in combination significantly inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis by NOHA when compared with that observed with cells treated with NOHA alone . Our results , therefore , indicate that the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis observed with NOHA can not be solely explained by a reduction in intracellular polyamine levels and that other mechanisms need to be also considered .
