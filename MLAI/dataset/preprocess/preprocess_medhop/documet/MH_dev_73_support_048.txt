Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol induces the apoptotic pathway in cultured cortical neurones via activation of the P21554 receptor . Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol , the principal psychoactive component of marijuana , exerts a variety of effects on the CNS , including impaired cognitive function and neurobehavioural deficits . The mechanisms underlying these neuronal responses to tetrahydrocannabinol are unclear but may involve alterations in neuronal viability . DB00470 has been shown to influence neuronal survival but the role of the cannabinoid receptors in the regulation of neuronal viability has not been fully clarified . In this study we demonstrate that tetrahydrocannabinol promotes the release of cytochrome c , activates caspase-3 , promotes cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme poly-ADP ribose polymerase and induces DNA fragmentation in cultured cortical neurones . These effects of tetrahydrocannabinol were completely abrogated by the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM-251 . The findings of this study demonstrate that tetrahydrocannabinol induces apoptosis in cortical neurones in a manner involving the P21554 subtype of cannabinoid receptor .
