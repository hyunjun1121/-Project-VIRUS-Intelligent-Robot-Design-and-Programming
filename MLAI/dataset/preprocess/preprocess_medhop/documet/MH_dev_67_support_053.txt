[ The effects of DB00644 agonist on steroidogenesis in the rat ovary ] . The effects of DB00644 agonist ( buserelin ) on in vitro ovarian steroidogenesis were studied using DES-treated immature rats and PMS-treated immature rats . The estradiol and progesterone secreted by the cultured ovarian cells and the activities of various enzymes of steroid-metabolism were examined with or without gonadotropins ( DB00094 or hCG ) , and the effects of 10(-6)-10(-12) M of buserelin on those indices were observed for 3-72 hours . In addition , the kinetic study of ovarian P30968 was performed using 125I-labelled buserelin and crude ovarian cell membrane fraction of PMS-treated rats . The Scatchard analysis revealed the specific high affinity and low capacity ovarian P30968 ( Kd = 0.92 nM and Bmax = 0.57 fmol/mg tissue ) . The DB00094 -stimulated cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme ( CSCC ) activity of the DES-treated rats was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by buserelin . Estradiol release and aromatase activity were increased by 10(-8) M buserelin within 48 hours from the beginning of the incubation of the PMS-treated rat ovarian cells , but were suppressed after 48 hours . DB06719 increased basal progesterone secretion and both activities of CSCC and of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of PMS-treated rat ovarian cells incubated without hCG , which were suppressed by buserelin co-incubated with 100 IU/ml of hCG . These results suggested that DB00644 plays a physiological role in ovarian steroidogenesis binding the specific receptor and that DB00644 promotes the development of the follicle through increased estrogen synthesis in the early stage of the folliculogenesis and the luteinization in the late stage of the follicular development through increased progesterone and decreased estradiol production and the luteolysis in the luteinized cells by hCG through decreased progesterone secretion .
