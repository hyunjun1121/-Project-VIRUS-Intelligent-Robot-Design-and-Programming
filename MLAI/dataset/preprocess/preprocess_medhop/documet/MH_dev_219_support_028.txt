Distinct roles of galactose-1P in galactose-mediated growth arrest of yeast deficient in galactose-1P uridylyltransferase ( P07902 ) and DB03501 4'-epimerase ( Q14376 ) . Galactose is metabolized in humans and other species by the three-enzyme Leloir pathway comprised of galactokinase ( P51570 ) , galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase ( P07902 ) , and DB03501 4'-epimerase ( Q14376 ) . Impairment of P07902 or Q14376 in humans results in the potentially lethal disorder galactosemia , and loss of either enzyme in yeast results in galactose-dependent growth arrest of cultures despite the availability of an alternate carbon source . In contrast , loss of P51570 in humans is not life-threatening , and in yeast has no impact on the growth of cultures challenged with galactose . Further , the growth of both P07902 -null and Q14376 -null yeast challenged with galactose is rescued by loss of P51570 , thereby implicating the P51570 reaction product , gal-1P , for a role in the galactose-sensitivity of both strains . However , the nature of that relationship has remained unclear . Here we have developed and applied a doxycycline-repressible allele of galactokinase to define the quantitative relationship between galactokinase activity , gal-1P accumulation , and growth arrest of galactose-challenged P07902 or Q14376 -deficient yeast . Our results demonstrate a clear threshold relationship between gal-1P accumulation and galactose-mediated growth arrest in both P07902 -null and Q14376 -null yeast , however , the threshold for the two strains is distinct . Further , we tested the galactose-sensitivity of yeast double-null for P07902 and Q14376 , and found that although loss of P07902 barely changed accumulation of gal-1P , it significantly lowered the accumulation of DB03501 , and also dramatically rescued growth of the Q14376 -null cells . Together , these data suggest that while gal-1P alone may account for the galactose-sensitivity of P07902 -null cells , other factors , likely to include DB03501 accumulation , must contribute to the galactose-sensitivity of Q14376 -null cells .
