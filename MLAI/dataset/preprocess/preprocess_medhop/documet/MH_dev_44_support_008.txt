Chronic delivery of a thrombospondin-1 mimetic decreases skeletal muscle capillarity in mice . Angiogenesis is an essential process for normal skeletal muscle function . There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that thrombospondin-1 ( P07996 -1 ) , a potent antiangiogenic protein in tumorigenesis , is an important regulator of both physiological and pathological skeletal muscle angiogenesis . We tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to a P07996 -1 mimetic ( DB05434 ) , which targets the P16671 P07996 -1 receptor , would decrease skeletal muscle capillarity as well as alter the balance between positive and negative angiogenic proteins under basal conditions . Osmotic minipumps with either DB05434 or vehicle ( 5 % dextrose ) were implanted subcutaneously in the subscapular region of C57/BL6 mice for 14 days . When compared to the vehicle treated mice , the DB05434 group had a 20 % decrease in capillarity in the superficial region of the gastrocnemius ( GA ) , 11 % decrease in the plantaris ( Q02083 ) , and a 35 % decrease in the soleus ( SOL ) . DB05434 also decreased muscle protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in both the GA ( -140 % ) and SOL ( -62 % ) ; however there was no change in P15692 in the Q02083 . Serum P15692 was not altered in DB05434 treated animals . Endogenous P07996 -1 protein expression in all muscles remained unaltered . Tunnel staining revealed no difference in muscle apoptosis between DB05434 and vehicle treated groups . These data provide evidence that the anti-angiogenic effects of P07996 -1 are mediated , at least in part , via the P16671 receptor . It also suggests that under physiologic conditions the P07996 -1/ P16671 axis plays a role in regulating basal skeletal muscle microvessel density .
