DB03758 -sensitive peptide binding to the N-terminal portion of P14625 . P14625 is a molecular chaperone that carries immunologically relevant peptides from cell to cell , transferring them to major histocompatibility proteins for presentation to T cells . Here we examine the binding of several peptides to recombinant P14625 and study the regulation and site of peptide binding . We show that P14625 contains a peptide-binding site in its N-terminal 355 amino acids . A number of peptides bind to this site with low on- and off-rates and with specificity that is distinct from that of another endoplasmic reticulum chaperone , P11021 / P11021 . Binding to the N-terminal fragment is sufficient to account for the peptide binding activity of the entire molecule . Peptide binding is inhibited by radicicol , a known inhibitor of the chaperone activities of HSP90-family proteins . However , the peptide-binding site is distinct from the radicicol-binding pocket , because both can bind to the N-terminal fragment simultaneously . Furthermore , peptide binding does not cause the same conformational change as does binding of radicicol . When the latter binds to the N-terminal domain , it induces a conformational change in the downstream , acidic domain of P14625 , as measured by altered gel mobility and loss of an antibody epitope . These results relate the peptide-binding activity of P14625 to its other function as a chaperone .
