Induction of the Galpha(q) signaling cascade by the human immunodeficiency virus envelope is required for virus entry . Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) envelope glycoprotein ( Env ) with the primary receptor P01730 and one of two coreceptors , P61073 or P51681 , activates a signaling cascade resulting in Rac-1 GTPase activation and stimulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganizations critical for HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion . The mechanism by which HIV-1 Env induces Rac-1 activation and subsequent actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is unknown . In this study , we show that Env-mediated Rac-1 activation is dependent on the activation of Galpha(q) and its downstream targets . Fusion and Rac-1 activation are mediated by Galpha(q) and phospholipase C ( P98160 ) , as shown by attenuation of fusion and Rac-1 activation in cells either expressing small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) targeting Galpha(q) or treated with the P98160 inhibitor U73122 . Rac-1 activation and fusion were also blocked by multiple protein kinase C inhibitors , by inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ release , by Pyk2-targeted siRNA , and by the Ras inhibitor S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid ( Q9H8T0 ) . Fusion was blocked without altering cell viability or cell surface localization of P01730 and P51681 . Similar results were obtained when cell fusion was induced by Env expressed on viral and cellular membranes and when cell lines or primary cells were the target . Treatment with inhibitors and siRNA specific for Galpha(i) or Galpha(s) signaling mediators had no effect on Env-mediated Rac-1 activation or cell fusion , indicating that the Galpha(q) pathway alone is responsible . These results could provide a new focus for therapeutic intervention with drugs targeting host signaling mediators rather than viral molecules , a strategy which is less likely to result in resistance .
