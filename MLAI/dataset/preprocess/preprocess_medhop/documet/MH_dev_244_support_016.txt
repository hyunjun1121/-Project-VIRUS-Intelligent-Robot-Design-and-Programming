Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase alleles and pyrimethamine use in pregnant Ghanaian women . Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum affects prevention of malaria in pregnancy . In a cross-sectional study of 530 pregnant Ghanaian women , P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) gene mutations linked with pyrimethamine resistance were assessed and associations with pyrimethamine intake were analyzed . P. falciparum infected 69 % of women without pyrimethamine use , 59 % of those who had a history of pyrimethamine consumption but a negative urine test , and 53 % of individuals with a positive urine test . Eighty-one percent , 43 % , and 74 % of the isolates contained the mutations DB00174 -108 , DB00167 -51 , and DB00125 -59 , respectively . DB00156 -108 occurred in 8 % . DB00205 use was associated with increased frequencies of DB00174 -108 and DB00125 -59 but not of DB00167 -51 or DB00156 -108 . In women with prophylaxis , wild-type parasites were absent and anemia tended to be more common with an increasing number of P00374 gene mutations . DB00205 appears to be not adequately effective in this part of Ghana , most likely due to the predominance of resistant parasites . Selection for resistance following insufficient prophylaxis could possibly affect the efficacy of future intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment .
