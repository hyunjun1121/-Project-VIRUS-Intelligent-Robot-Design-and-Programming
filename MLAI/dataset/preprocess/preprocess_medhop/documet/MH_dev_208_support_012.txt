Q9UBC3 interacts with O60264 chromatin remodeling enzyme , HDACs 1 and 2 , and components of the histone methylation system . The non-random pattern of genome-wide DNA methylation in mammalian cells is established and maintained by DNA methyltransferases P26358 , 3A , and 3B . De novo DNA methyltransferase Q9UBC3 is critical for embryonic development and is mutated in ICF syndrome . Despite its importance in normal cellular functioning , little is known about how Q9UBC3 operates in the context of chromatin . Here we demonstrate that Q9UBC3 associates with four chromatin-associated enzymatic activities common to transcriptionally repressed , heterochromatic regions of the genome : DNA methyltransferase , histone deacetylase , ATPase , and histone methylase activities . By immunoprecipitation and Q86UG4 pull-down , we show that Q9UBC3 interacts with Q13547 , Q92769 , P59665 proteins , Suv39h1 , and the DB00171 -dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme O60264 . Endogenous O60264 is also associated with DNA methyltransferase activity . These proteins co-localize extensively with Q9UBC3 in heterochromatic regions . Our results therefore link Q9UBC3 to three other components of the epigenetic machinery and provide important insights into how DNA methylation patterns may be established within the chromatin environment .
