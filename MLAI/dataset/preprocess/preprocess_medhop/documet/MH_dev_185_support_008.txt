Recombinant P17936 inhibits allergic lung inflammation , P15692 production , and vascular leak in a mouse model of asthma . BACKGROUND : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) plays a pro-inflammatory mediator as well as a vascular permeability factor in bronchial asthma . P01308 -like growth factor ( IGF ) -I is also involved in the inflammatory process associated with bronchial asthma and stimulates P15692 expression . The IGF-binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) , especially P17936 , display distinctive properties and can interfere with various biological processes . METHODS : In this study , an ovalbumin ( OVA ) -induced murine model of allergic airway disease was used to investigate which mechanism is implicated in the preventive and therapeutic actions of P17936 administered exogenously on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness , in particular focusing on the regulation of P15692 expression . RESULTS : Administration of recombinant human P17936 to OVA-inhaled mice substantially attenuated the increases in hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -α activity , P05019 production , and P15692 protein levels in the lung . In addition , the blockade of P05019 action decreased the OVA-induced P15692 expression , airway inflammation , and bronchial hyper-responsiveness . The administration of recombinant human P17936 or CBO-P11 also reduced significantly increases in inflammatory cells , airway hyper-responsiveness , levels of P05112 , P05113 , P35225 , and vascular permeability in the lung of OVA-inhaled mice . Moreover , when recombinant human P17936 was administered after the completion of OVA inhalation , these therapeutic effects of P17936 were also observed . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that P17936 administered exogenously may attenuate antigen-induced airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness through the modulation of vascular leakage and P15692 expression mediated by HIF-1α/HIF-2α signaling as well as P05019 action in allergic airway disease of mice .
