Airway epithelium mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise on asthma . Airway epithelium plays an important role in the asthma physiopathology . Aerobic exercise decreases Th2 response in murine models of allergic asthma , but its effects on the structure and activation of airway epithelium in asthma are unknown . BALB/c mice were divided into control , aerobic exercise , ovalbumin-sensitized and ovalbumin-sensitized plus aerobic exercise groups . Ovalbumin sensitization occurred on days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , and aerosol challenge from day 21 to day 50 . Aerobic exercise started on day 22 and ended on day 50 . Total cells and eosinophils were reduced in ovalbumin-sensitized group submitted to aerobic exercise . Aerobic exercise also reduced the oxidative and nitrosative stress and the epithelial expression of Th2 cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules , growth factors and NF-kB and Q99572 receptor . Additionally , aerobic exercise increased the epithelial expression of P22301 in non-sensitized and sensitized animals . These findings contribute to the understanding of the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise for chronic allergic airway inflammation , suggesting an immune-regulatory role of exercise on airway epithelium .
