Synergism between bosutinib ( DB06616 ) and the Chk1 inhibitor ( PF-00477736 ) in highly imatinib-resistant P11274 /ABL‚Å∫ leukemia cells . Interactions between the dual P11274 / P00519 and Src inhibitor bosutinib and the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 were examined in P11274 / P00519 (+) leukemia cells , particularly imatinib-resistant cells , including those with the T315I mutation . Bosutinib blocked PF-00477736-induced P27361 /2 activation and sharply increased apoptosis in association with Mcl-1 inhibition , p34(cdc2) dephosphorylation , BimEL up-regulation , and DNA damage in imatinib-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL cell lines . Inhibition of Src or Q02750 by shRNA significantly enhanced PF-0047736 lethality . Bosutinib/PF-00477736 co-treatment also potentiated cell death in P28906 (+) CML patient samples , including dasatinib-resistant blast crisis cells exhibiting both T315I and E355G mutations , but was minimally toxic to normal P28906 (+) cells . Finally , combined in vivo treatment significantly suppressed BaF3/T315I tumor growth and prolonged survival in an allogeneic mouse model . Together , these findings suggest that this targeted combination strategy warrants attention in IM-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL .
