Orai proteins interact with TRPC channels and confer responsiveness to store depletion . The TRPC ( C-type transient receptor potential ) class of ion channels has been hypothesized to participate in store-operated Ca(2+) entry ( SOCE ) . Recently , however , Q13586 and Orai1 proteins have been proposed to form SOCE channels . Whether TRPCs participate in SOCE that is dependent on or regulated by Orai has not been explored . Here we show that Orai1 physically interacts with the N and C termini of Q13507 and Q9Y210 , and that in cells overexpressing either Q13507 or Q9Y210 in a store-depletion insensitive manner , these TRPCs become sensitive to store depletion upon expression of an exogenous Orai . Thus , Orai-1 , -2 , and -3 enhanced thapsigargin-induced calcium entry by 50-150 % in cells stably overexpressing either Q13507 or Q9Y210 . Orai1 expression had no significant effect on endogenous , thapsigargin-induced calcium entry in wild-type cells ( P29320 -293 , COS1 ) , in P29320 cells expressing a thapsigargin-sensitive variant of Q13507 ( TRPC3a ) , or in P29320 cells overexpressing another membrane protein , P37288 . Single-channel cation currents present in membrane patches of Q13507 -overexpressing cells were suppressed by expression of Orai1 . We propose that Orai proteins by interacting with TRPCs act as regulatory subunits that confer Q13586 -mediated store depletion sensitivity to these channels .
