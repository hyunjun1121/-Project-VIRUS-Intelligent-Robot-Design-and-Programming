Kinetics of inflammatory response of astrocytes induced by TLR 3 and O00206 ligation . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are sentinels of the innate immune system that recognize an array of exogenous and endogenous pathogenic molecules . The ligation of the receptors triggers inflammatory response necessary for pathogen elimination and for the healing process . In the present study we examined inflammatory response of astrocytes elicited by the ligation of O15455 and O00206 . Astrocytic cultures established from newborn rat brains were exposed to double stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , the ligands for O15455 and O00206 , respectively . The expression of cytokine genes was determined by RNase protection assay , and the generation of nitric oxide ( NO ) was measured by Griess technique . Both ligands upregulated the expression of several cytokines ( i.e. , IL-1alpha , IL-1beta , P05231 , TNFalpha , GM- P04141 , LTbeta , and TGFbeta3 ) and downregulated the expression of MIF , but have no effect on the expression of P60568 , P08700 , P05112 , P05113 , P22301 , TGFbeta1 , TGFbeta2 , TNFbeta , and IFNgamma . Although dsRNA upregulated the expression of IFNbeta , LPS did not indicating that the Q8IUC6 -dependent branch of O00206 signaling is inactive in astrocytes . Proinflammatory response as seen from upregulated cytokine expression and NO generation reached a peak within the first day of exposure , and was subsequently abrogated . The cells also became refractory to subsequent stimulation by the ligands indicating the existence of negative feedback mechanisms that control proinflammatory response in astrocytes .
