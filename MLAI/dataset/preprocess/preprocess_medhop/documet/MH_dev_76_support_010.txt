P62158 regulates Ca2+-sensing receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling and its cell surface expression . The Ca(2+)-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) is a member of family C of the GPCRs responsible for sensing extracellular Ca(2+) ( [Ca(2+)](o) ) levels , maintaining extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis , and transducing Ca(2+) signaling from the extracellular milieu to the intracellular environment . In the present study , we have demonstrated a Ca(2+)-dependent , stoichiometric interaction between P62158 and a P62158 -binding domain ( CaMBD ) located within the C terminus of P41180 ( residues 871-898 ) . Our studies suggest a wrapping around 1-14-like mode of interaction that involves global conformational changes in both lobes of P62158 with concomitant formation of a helical structure in the CaMBD . More importantly , the Ca(2+)-dependent association between P62158 and the C terminus of P41180 is critical for maintaining proper responsiveness of intracellular Ca(2+) responses to changes in extracellular Ca(2+) and regulating cell surface expression of the receptor .
