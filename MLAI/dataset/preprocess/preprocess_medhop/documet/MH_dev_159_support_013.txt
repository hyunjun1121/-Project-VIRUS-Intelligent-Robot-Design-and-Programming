Involvement of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 in the formation of a lacuna-like cerebral cavity . We used a modified pial vessel disruption ( PVD ) protocol with adult male Wistar rats to mimic small-vessel stroke in the cerebral cortex . Within 3 weeks , this lesion develops into a single lacuna-like cavity , which is fluid-filled and encapsulated by reactive astrocytes . DB01017 treatment that commences 1 hr after lesion and continues for 6 days prevents the cavitation and causes a filling of the lesion with reactive astrocytes and no barrier . Here , we determined whether inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 ( MMPs ) mediates this minocycline action . Confocal microscopy revealed increased punctate staining of MMPs inside the lesion sites after 2 days of PVD . Astrocytes lined the lesion border but showed sparse localization inside the lesion . In contrast , increased MMP levels inside the lesion coincided with increased Q92838 or OX-42 immunostaining , suggesting that MMP elevation reflected increased secretions from microglia/macrophages . Imaging analyses also revealed that minocycline administered for 2 days before animal euthanasia , significantly decreased MMP levels within the lesion . Moreover , Western blot analysis of cortical tissue extracts showed a significant 30-40 % upregulation of MMPs 2 days after lesion . DB01017 administered 2 hr before the lesion significantly inhibited both P14780 and P08253 levels by ∼40 % . In contrast , minocycline administered 1 hr after the lesion only decreased P14780 levels by ∼30 % . Because MMP inhibition with batimastat injection also prevented cavity formation at 21 days , we conclude that minocycline prevented the creation of a lacuna-like cyst in the cerebral cortex by inhibiting the MMP secretion from microglia in the affected tissue .
