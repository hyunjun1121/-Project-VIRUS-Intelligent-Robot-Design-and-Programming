Constitutive cyclo-oxygenase-2 does not contribute to the development of human visceral pain hypersensitivity . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Central sensitisation ( CS ) , contributes to the development and maintenance of gastrointestinal pain hypersensitivity . Constitutive cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) contributes to central sensitisation in somatic pain hypersensitivity but its role in mediating visceral pain hypersensitivity is unknown . We therefore conducted a study to determine if P35354 inhibition with DB00580 attenuates the development or early maintenance of CS in a validated human oesophageal pain hypersensitivity model . METHODS : Healthy volunteers were studied in two randomised , double blind , crossover studies in which pain thresholds ( PT ) to electrical stimulation were assessed in the proximal oesophagus , chest wall and foot , prior to and following a distal oesophageal acid infusion . Protocol 1 : DB00580 , ( 40 mg ) or matching placebo was given orally for 4 days prior to oesophageal acid infusion . Protocol 2 : IV DB08439 ( 40 mg ) or saline was given 120 min after oesophageal acid infusion . RESULTS : DB00580 did not prevent the induction of secondary allodynia in the proximal oesophagus nor did it attenuate it following its establishment . Chest wall PT fell following oesophageal acid but foot PT remained unchanged ; highlighting the development viscero-somatic convergence due to CS . DB00580 had no analgesic or anti-hyperalgesic effect on chest wall or foot PT . CONCLUSIONS : Neither the induction nor initial maintenance of acid induced oesophageal pain hypersensitivity is prevented by DB00580 , suggesting that constitutive spinal P35354 does not contribute to the development or early maintenance of acute visceral central sensitisation .
