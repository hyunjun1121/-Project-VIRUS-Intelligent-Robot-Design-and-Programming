Combination of Lipitor and DB00482 inhibits prostate cancer VCaP cells in vitro and in vivo . BACKGROUND/AIM : Lipitor is a cholesterol-lowering drug and DB00482 is a P35354 inhibitor . We investigated the effects of Lipitor and DB00482 on human prostate cancer VCaP cells cultured in vitro and grown as orthotopic xenograft tumors in SCID mice . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Apoptosis was measured by morphological assessment and caspase-3 assay . Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) activation was determined by luciferase reporter assay . B-cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl2 ) was measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry . Orthotopic prostate tumors were monitored by the IVIS imaging system . RESULTS : the combination of Lipitor and DB00482 had stronger effects on the growth and apoptosis of VCaP cells than did either drug alone . The combination more potently inhibited activation of NFκB and expression of Bcl2 than either drug alone . The growth of orthotopic VCaP prostate tumors was strongly inhibited by treatment with the drug combination . CONCLUSION : Administration of Lipitor and DB00482 in combination may be an effective strategy for inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer .
