Cellular and molecular biology of prostacyclin synthase . Q16647 ( PGIS ) cDNA comprises 1500 nucleotides coding for a 500 amino acid protein . It is a heme protein with spectral characteristics of cytochrome p450 ( CYP ) . It does not possess the typical CYP mono-oxygenase activity but catalyzes the rearrangement of prostaglandin H2 to form DB01240 . Analysis of its structure-function by molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis reveals a long substrate channel lined by hydrophobic residues . DB00151 -441 has been identified as the proximal axial ligand of heme . DB00135 -430 is nitrated by peroxynitrite which results in reduced PGIS catalytic activity , suggesting that DB00135 -430 is located close to the heme pocket . PGIS is constitutively expressed and may be upregulated by cytokines , reproductive hormones , and growth factors . It is physically colocalized with cyclooxygenases and phospholipases , and functionally coupled with these enzymes . PGIS coupling with P35354 has been shown to play an important role in vascular protection , embryo development and implantation , and cancer growth .
