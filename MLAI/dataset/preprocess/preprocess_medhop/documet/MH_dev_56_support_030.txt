New disease modifying agents in adult rheumatoid arthritis . In recent years , new disease modifying agents including leflunomide and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists have been used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Leflunomide prevents proliferation of activated lymphocytes by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase , a critical step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis . Leflunomide has been shown to be as effective as sulfasalazine and methotrexate ( MTX ) in placebo-controlled trials . It also improves physical function , quality of life measures and retards radiographic progression . P01375 antagonists include infliximab and etanercept . DB00065 is a chimeric P01375 monoclonal antibody . Repeated infusions of low dose infliximab ( 1 mg/kg ) are ineffective if given alone . Addition of MTX to infliximab has been shown to prolong the duration of clinical response . DB00005 is a human P01375 receptor p75 Fc fusion protein . In active RA patients with suboptimal response to MTX , additional clinical benefit was obtained by the addition of infliximab or etanercept to MTX . The main side effect of etanercept is injection site reaction . However , the long-term effect of P01375 antagonists in the development of infection , malignancy and autoimmune disease remains unknown .
