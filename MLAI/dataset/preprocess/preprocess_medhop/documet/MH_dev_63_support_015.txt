An O95477 truncation shows no dominant negative effect in a familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia pedigree with three O95477 mutations . The DB00171 binding cassette transporter ( O95477 ) A1 is a key determinant of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels . Mutations in O95477 are a major genetic contributor to low HDL-C levels within the general population . Following the finding of three different O95477 mutations , p.C978fsX988 , p.T1512M and p.N1800H in a subject with hypoalphalipoproteinemia , we aimed to establish whether the p.C978fsX988 truncation exerted a dominant negative effect on the full-length O95477 alleles within family members as has been reported for other O95477 truncations . Characterisation of the p.C978fsX988 mutant in transfected P29320 293 cells showed it to be expressed as a GFP fusion protein but lacking in cholesterol efflux function . This was in keeping with results from cholesterol efflux assays in the fibroblasts of p.C978fsX988 carriers which also showed impaired efflux . Allele- specific quantification of p.C978fsX988 mRNA and analysis of O95477 protein levels in the fibroblasts of p.C978fsX988 heterozygotes showed negligible levels of mRNA and protein expression . There was no evidence of a dominant negative effect on wildtype or p.N1800H protein levels . We conclude that in the case of the p.C978fsX988 truncated mutant a lack of expression precludes it from having a dominant negative effect .
