Ligand-mediated endocytosis and intracellular sequestration of guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptors : role of GDAY motif . The guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 /NPRA ) , also referred to as P16066 , is a single polypeptide molecule having a critical function in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular homeostasis . P16066 /NPRA , which resides in the plasma membrane , consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain , a single transmembrane domain , and an intracellular cytoplasmic region containing a protein kinase-like homology domain ( KHD ) and a guanylyl cyclase ( GC ) catalytic domain . After binding with atrial and brain natriuretic peptides ( P01160 and DB04899 ) , P16066 /NPRA is internalized and sequestered into intracellular compartments . Therefore , P16066 /NPRA is a dynamic cellular macromolecule that traverses different subcellular compartments through its lifetime . This review describes the roles of short-signal sequences in the internalization , trafficking , and intracellular redistribution of P16066 /NPRA from cell surface to cell interior . Evidence indicates that , after internalization , the ligand-receptor complexes dissociate inside the cell and a population of P16066 /NPRA recycles back to the plasma membrane . Subsequently , the disassociated ligands are degraded in the lysosomes . However , a small percentage of the ligand escapes the lysosomal degradative pathway , and is released intact into culture medium . Using pharmacologic and molecular perturbants , emphasis has been placed on the cellular regulation and processing of ligand-bound P16066 /NPRA in terms of receptor trafficking and down-regulation in intact cells . The discussion is concluded by examining the functions of short-signal sequence motifs in the cellular life-cycle of P16066 /NPRA , including endocytosis , trafficking , metabolic processing , inactivation , and/or down-regulation in model cell systems .
