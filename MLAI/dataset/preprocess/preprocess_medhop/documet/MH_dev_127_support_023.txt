Purinergic receptors involved in the immunomodulatory effects of DB00171 in human blood . We recently showed that the physiological compound DB00171 simultaneously inhibited P01375 and stimulated P22301 release in LPS-PHA stimulated blood . The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism involved in the concerted modulatory effect of DB00171 on P01375 and P22301 . Incubation of blood with DB00171 in the presence of selective P2 receptor antagonists showed that the stimulatory effect of DB00171 on P22301 release was completely annihilated by both 2-MeSAMP ( a Q9H244 /13 receptor antagonist ) and PSB-0413 ( a Q9H244 receptor antagonist ) . On the other hand , the inhibitory effect of DB00171 on P01375 release was completely reversed by 5'- P30566 ( a Q96G91 receptor antagonist ) as well as by H-89 , an inhibitor of DB02527 -activated PKA . The concerted inhibition by DB00171 of P01375 release via Q96G91 activation and stimulation of P22301 release via Q9H244 activation implicates a novel approach towards immunomodulation by altering the balance among pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines .
