[ GH-secreting pituitary adenomas -- correlation between clinical features , growth potential and histopathological studies ] . We compared clinical features , including endocrinological and radiological findings , histological features and the proliferative parameters ( P12004 , MIB-1 and AgNORs ) with immunohistochemical features in growth hormone ( GH ) secreting pituitary adenomas . 18 cases were divided into two groups based on immunohistochemical intracytoplasmic stainings for cytokeratin : a prominent dot-like pattern ( group I , 6 cases ) and a diffuse perinuclear pattern ( group II , 12 cases ) . Patients in group I ( 6 females , m = 37.6 years old ) were younger , showed female predominance and had a shorter history of acromegaly compared with patients in group II ( 7 males , 5 females , m = 44.9 years old ) . Although the size of the adenomas tend to be larger in group I , no difference was recognized in plasma GH levels between the two groups . Increased serum prolactin ( PRL ) levels were accompanied more common in group I . Abnormal GH responses to TRH and P01148 injection and GH suppressions to bromocriptine administration were more frequently noted in group II than group I . Surgical approaches were transcranial in most cases of group I and transphenoidal in group II . There was no difference in surgical results as to the correction rate of GH levels between the two groups . Histopathologically , group I adenomas were mostly chromophobic , weakly positive for GH , and were generally negative for PRL and alpha-subunit . On the other hand , group II adenomas were mostly acidophilic , diffusely stained for GH , and were often positive for PRL and alpha-subunit . However , there was no significant difference in proliferating parameters between the two groups. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
