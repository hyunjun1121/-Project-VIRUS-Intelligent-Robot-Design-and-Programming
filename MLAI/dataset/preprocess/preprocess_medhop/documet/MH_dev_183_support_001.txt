Alpha synuclein is transported into and out of the brain by the blood-brain barrier . P37840 ( α-Syn ) , a small protein with multiple physiological and pathological functions , is one of the dominant proteins found in Lewy Bodies , a pathological hallmark of Lewy body disorders , including Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . More recently , α-Syn has been found in body fluids , including blood and cerebrospinal fluid , and is likely produced by both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system . Exchange of α-Syn between the brain and peripheral tissues could have important pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications . However , little is known about the ability of α-Syn to cross the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) . Here , we found that radioactively labeled α-Syn crossed the BBB in both the brain-to-blood and the blood-to-brain directions at rates consistent with saturable mechanisms . P01130 -related protein-1 ( Q07954 ) , but not p-glycoprotein , may be involved in α-Syn efflux and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced inflammation could increase α-Syn uptake by the brain by disrupting the BBB .
