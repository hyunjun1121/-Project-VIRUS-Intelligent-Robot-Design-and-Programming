Purinergic receptor ligands stimulate pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression in AtT-20 pituitary corticotroph cells . Although recent studies have suggested that purinergic receptors are expressed in the anterior pituitary gland , their involvement in the regulation of pituitary hormone gene expression is not completely understood . In the present study , we examined the expression of purinergic receptors and the effects of purinergic receptor ligands on pro-opiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) gene expression , in AtT20 mouse corticotroph cells . We identified the expression of most of the purinergic receptor subtypes ( A1 , A2 , P51575 , 3-7 , P47900 , 2 , 4 ) mRNAs , analysed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . We also found that adenosine and DB00171 , two representative and endogenous agonists of A1-3 and P2X/P2Y receptors , respectively , stimulated the 5'-promoter activity of the P01189 gene in a dose- and time-related manner . When these ligands were simultaneously used with corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) , effects that were more than additive were observed , suggesting an enhancing role of these compounds in P06850 -mediated adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) synthesis . These ligands also stimulated the expression of transcription factors involved in the regulation of the P01189 gene , but did not enhance DB01285 secretion . Finally , the positive effect of adenosine as well as P06850 was completely inhibited by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 , whereas that of DB00171 was not influenced , indicating that different intracellular signalling pathways mediate these effects . Altogether , our results suggest a stimulatory role for these purinergic receptor ligands in the regulation of P01189 gene expression in corticotroph cells . Because adenosine and DB00171 are known to be produced within the pituitary gland , it is possible they may be acting in an autocrine/paracrine fashion .
