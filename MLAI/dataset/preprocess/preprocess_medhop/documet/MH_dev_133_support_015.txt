Intracellular signaling mechanisms associated with Q08722 modified surfaces . We have previously established that recombinant Q08722 can ameliorate the inflammatory response to synthetic polymeric surfaces . Here , we begin to profile , at the transcriptional , translational and cell signaling level , the inflammatory cell response when blood interacts with Q08722 modified polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) ( Q08722 -PVC ) . We used qPCR arrays to compare transcriptional changes between human whole blood exposed to Q08722 -PVC or PVC . Transcription of Q9UBH0 , Q8WWZ1 , Q96PD4 , P10147 , P80075 , Q9NRJ3 , P48061 , and O43927 was upregulated in blood exposed to PVC , compared to Q08722 -PVC . The increase in P10147 and P80075 transcription correlated with an increase in the chemokines ' presence in the plasma . Exposure of blood to Q08722 -PVC resulted in an increase , compared to PVC , in transcription of P13500 , P13236 , P78556 , P09341 , TGFÎ²3 , Q9NR23 , P55107 , P29965 , and P50591 . Q08722 -PVC exposure resulted in an increase of the following matrix metalloproteinase related genes : P03956 , P09237 , P45452 , and P51512 . Phosflow cytometry , and assays examining transcription factor binding , cell attachment , and genome-wide chromatin association indicated that members of the JAK- P35610 signaling pathway , particularly O60674 and P42229 , mediate inflammatory cell interactions with Q08722 -PVC . Our data demonstrate that differential molecular responses to Q08722 involve downregulation of cytokines , upregulation of MMPs , and JAK/ P35610 signaling mechanisms .
