Pharmacogenetics of aspirin resistance : a comprehensive systematic review . AIMS : The aim was to perform a systematic review of all candidate gene association studies in aspirin resistance . METHODS : Electronic databases were searched up until 1 December 2007 for all studies investigating any candidate gene for aspirin resistance in humans . DB00945 resistance was required to have been measured by a standardized laboratory technique to be included in the analysis . RESULTS : Within 31 studies , 50 polymorphisms in 11 genes were investigated in 2834 subjects . The PlA1/A2 polymorphism in the P05106 platelet receptor was the most frequently investigated , with 19 studies in 1389 subjects . The PlA1/A2 variant was significantly associated with aspirin resistance when measured in healthy subjects [ odds ratio ( OR ) 2.36 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.24 , 4.49 ; P = 0.009 ] . Combining genetic data from all studies ( comprising both healthy subjects and those with cardiovascular disease ) reduced the observed effect size ( OR 1.14 , 95 % CI 0.84 , 1.54 ; P = 0.40 ) . Moreover , the observed effect of PlA1/A2 genotype varied depending on the methodology used for determining aspirin sensitivity/resistance . No significant association was found with aspirin resistance in four other investigated polymorphisms in the P23219 , GPla , P47900 or Q9H244 genes . CONCLUSIONS : Our data support a genetic association between the PlA1/A2 molecular variant and aspirin resistance in healthy subjects , with the effect diminishing in the presence of cardiovascular disease . The laboratory methodology used influences the detection of aspirin resistance . However , as heterogeneity was significant and our results are based on a limited number of studies , further studies are required to confirm our findings .
