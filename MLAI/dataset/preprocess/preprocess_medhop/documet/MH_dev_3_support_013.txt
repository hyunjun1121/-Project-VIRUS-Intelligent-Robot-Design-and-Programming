LG839 : anti-obesity effects and polymorphic gene correlates of reward deficiency syndrome . INTRODUCTION : This study systematically assessed the weight management effects of a novel experimental DNA-customized nutraceutical , LG839 ( LifeGen , Inc. , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . METHODS : A total of 1058 subjects who participated in the overall D.I.E.T. study were genotyped and administered an LG839 variant based on polymorphic outcomes . A subset of 27 self-identified obese subjects of Dutch descent , having the same DNA pattern of four out of the five candidate genes tested ( chi-square analysis ) as the entire data set , was subsequently evaluated . Simple t tests comparing a number of weight management parameters before and after 80 days of treatment with LG839 were performed . RESULTS : Significant results were observed for weight loss , sugar craving reduction , appetite suppression , snack reduction , reduction of late night eating ( all P < 0.01 ) , increased perception of overeating , enhanced quality of sleep , increased happiness ( all P < 0.05 ) , and increased energy ( P < 0.001 ) . Polymorphic correlates were obtained for a number of genes ( P41159 , Q07869 -gamma2 , P42898 , 5- Q13049 , and P14416 genes ) with positive clinical parameters tested in this study . Of all the outcomes and gene polymorphisms , only the P14416 gene polymorphism ( A1 allele ) had a significant Pearson correlation with days on treatment ( r=0.42 , P=0.045 ) . CONCLUSION : If these results are confirmed in additional rigorous , controlled studies , we carefully suggest that DNA-directed targeting of certain regulator genes , along with customized nutraceutical intervention , provides a unique framework and strategic modality to combat obesity .
