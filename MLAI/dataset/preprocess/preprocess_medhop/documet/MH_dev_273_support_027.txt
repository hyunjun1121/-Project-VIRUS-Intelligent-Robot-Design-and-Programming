The conformational plasticity of calmodulin upon calcium complexation gives a model of its interaction with the oedema factor of Bacillus anthracis . We analyzed the conformational plasticity of calmodulin ( P62158 ) when it is bound to the oedema factor ( EF ) of Bacillus anthracis and its response to calcium complexation with molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . The EF- P62158 complex was simulated during 15 ns for three different levels of calcium bound to P62158 . They were respectively no calcium ion ( EF-(Apo- P62158 ) ) , two calcium ions bound to the C-terminal domain of P62158 ( EF-(2Ca- P62158 ) ) , and four calcium ions bound to P62158 ( EF-(4Ca- P62158 ) ) . Calculations were performed using AMBER package . The analysis of the MD simulations illustrates how P62158 forces EF in an open conformation to form the adenylyl cyclase enzymatic site , especially with the two calcium form of P62158 , best suited to fit the open conformation of EF . By contrast , P62158 encounters bending and unwinding of its flexible interlinker in EF-(Apo- P62158 ) and EF-(4Ca- P62158 ) . DB01373 binding to one domain of P62158 affects the other one , showing a transmission of information along the protein structure . The analysis of the P62158 domains conformation along the simulations brings an atomistic and dynamic explanation for the instability of these complexes . Indeed the EF-hand helices of the N-terminal domain tend to open upon calcium binding ( EF-(4Ca- P62158 ) ) , although the domain is locked by EF . By contrast , the C-terminal domain is strongly locked in the open conformation by EF , and the removal of calcium induces a collapse of EF catalytic site ( EF-(Apo- P62158 ) ) .
