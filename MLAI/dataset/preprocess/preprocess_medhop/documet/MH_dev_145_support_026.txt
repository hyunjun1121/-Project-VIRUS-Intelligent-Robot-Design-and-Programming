DB00104 is the favorable alternative for cisplatin resistance reversal of ovarian cancer in vitro and in nude mice in vivo . This study aimed to observe the effects of octreotide ( O75051 ) on cisplatin resistance reversal of cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice in vivo . MTT method and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of cisplatin , O75051 or the combination of these two compounds on the proliferation and apoptosis of SKOV3- O60220 cells . The size and weight of xenograft tumors from the nude mice model were measured . Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of P30874 , P08183 , Q92887 , Q86UG4 -pi and P00533 in SKOV3/ O60220 cells following the different treatment . At the concentration of 2.5-20 g/ml , O75051 significantly reduced IC50 ( p < 0.05 ) and promoted apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ) of SKOV3- O60220 cells ' response to cisplatin . Unchanged expression was found in P30874 on the SKOV3/ O60220 cell in vitro after O75051 treatment , but increased expression in vivo ( p < 0.05 ) . O75051 increased Q86UG4 -pi expression ( p < 0.05 ) and reduced Q92887 and P00533 expression ( p < 0.05 ) in a dose-dependent manner . The similar results were obtained in mice in vivo experiment , except the reduced expression of Q86UG4 -pi . It is suggested that O75051 could inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and promote apoptosis , via the cell surface P30874 , and reverse cisplatin resistance through inhibition of Q92887 , P00533 , and even Q86UG4 -pi expressions .
