Differential expression of the urokinase receptor in fibroblasts from normal and fibrotic human lungs . Binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) to a specific receptor ( Q03405 ) on human lung fibroblasts enables it to regulate cellular proteolysis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . Binding studies with radiolabeled uPA indicated that both normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts express the receptor , but cells from fibrotic tissues bound significantly more uPA ( P < 0.001 ) . Phorbol myristate acetate , lipopolysaccharide , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) increased uPA binding and plasminogen activation at the cell surface , with a greater maximal effect on fibrotic than on normal fibroblasts . Excess unlabeled uPA , specific antibody , or antisense oligonucleotides inhibited uPA binding . Ribonuclease ( RNase ) protection assays showed higher levels of Q03405 messenger ribonuleic acid ( mRNA ) in each of the five fibrotic cell lines than in normal fibroblasts . uPA was mitogenic for normal as well as fibrotic fibroblasts , indicating that receptor binding concurrently localizes cellular proteolytic activity and stimulates mitogenesis . Morphometry and immunohistochemical analysis showed that Q03405 , as well as uPA , was increased in fibroblasts in fibrotic lung tissue . Increased expression of Q03405 by fibrotic lung fibroblasts and enhanced urokinase binding induced by proinflammatory cytokines suggest a novel mechanism by which fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling and proliferation may be regulated in interstitial lung diseases .
