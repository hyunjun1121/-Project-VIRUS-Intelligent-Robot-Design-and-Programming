Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of DB05225 , a novel inhibitor of P09917 -activating protein ( P20292 ) . The P09917 -activating protein ( P20292 ) gene and an increase in leukotriene ( LT ) production are linked to the risk of asthma , myocardial infarction , and stroke . We evaluated the pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics , and tolerability of 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( DB05225 ) , a novel P20292 inhibitor , in healthy subjects . Single and multiple doses of DB05225 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of blood Q06643 (4) production and dose-related inhibition of urinary LTE(4) . After a single oral dose ( 50-1,000 mg ) of DB05225 , the maximum concentration ( C(max) ) and area under the curve ( AUC ) in plasma increased in a dose-dependent manner . After multiple-dose administration ( 50-1,000 mg once daily for 11 days ) , there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the first and last days of treatment . DB05225 was well tolerated at all doses in both the single- and multiple-dose cohorts . Further clinical trials with DB05225 in inflammatory diseases are warranted .
