Stable expression of a neuronal dopaminergic progenitor phenotype in cell lines derived from human amniotic fluid cells . Cells from human amniotic fluid derived from the fetus are considered a source of multipotent cells . Their properties have not been fully exploited , partially because unlike other embryonic sources such as embryonic stem ( ES ) cells , cell lines from amniocentesis samples have not been generated . We have established and characterized the properties of eight individual cell lines . Flow cytometry using several cell surface markers showed that all cell lines generated consisted of homogeneous populations that lack HLAII antigenicity . Using a combination of immunocytochemistry , Western blotting , and RT-PCR , we found weak expression of Oct4 and nestin and strong expression of tubulin-betaIII , P11137 , and tau . Specific markers for cholinergic , (nor)adrenergic , and GABAergic neurons or glia were weakly expressed or absent , whereas expression of factors implicated in early induction of dopaminergic neurons , TGF-beta3 and beta-catenin were present . Further analysis showed strong expression of EN-1 , c- P07949 , PTX3 , and P43354 essential for induction and survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons , TH , P20711 , and Q05940 components of dopamine synthesis and secretion , and syntaxin1A and P60880 necessary for neurotransmitter exocytosis . This phenotype was retained throughout passages and up to the current passage 36 . Expression of neuronal and dopaminergic markers in individual AF cell lines was comparable to expression in neurons induced from ES cells and in IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y neuroblastomas . Our data show that cell lines can be derived from subcultures of amniocentesis , and are primarily composed of a population of progenitors with a phenotype similar to that of committed mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons .
