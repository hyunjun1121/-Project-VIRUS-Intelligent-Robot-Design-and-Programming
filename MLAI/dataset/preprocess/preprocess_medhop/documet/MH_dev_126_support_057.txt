Phase II clinical trial data with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib ( DB00530 ) in non-small-cell lung cancer . Erlotinib ( DB00530 ; Tarceva ) is an orally available , highly specific epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor . The results of 3 phase II studies with erlotinib in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) are reviewed herein : ( 1 ) in patients with chemotherapy-resistant , P00533 / P00533 -expressing NSCLC of all histologies , ( 2 ) in patients with bronchoalveolar carcinoma previously untreated or treated with chemotherapy , and ( 3 ) as first-line therapy in elderly patients with NSCLC of all histologies . These studies have evaluated tumor response , survival , and symptom improvement . Erlotinib was given as an oral , continuous daily dose of 150 mg . The drug was well tolerated ; drug-related cutaneous rash and diarrhea were observed in approximately two thirds of patients . Withdrawals caused by toxicity were rare . The response rates were 12.3 % , 25 % , and 13.3 % , respectively . Mature survival data are available for the first trial . The median survival was 8.4 months , and the 1-year survival rate was 40 % . All responding patients in the first and second trials presented skin rash . In addition , survival correlated with the occurrence and severity of rash in the first trial . No data on the correlation between rash and survival are available for the second and third trials . Erlotinib is active and well tolerated in patients with NSCLC as first- and second-line therapy . Cutaneous rash appears to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit , but this finding needs to be confirmed in ongoing and future studies .
