Induction of retinoic acid receptor-beta suppresses cyclooxygenase-2 expression in esophageal cancer cells . Since retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -beta mRNA is frequently lost during esophageal carcinogenesis and esophageal cancer cells that do not express P10826 are resistant to retinoic acid ( RA ) , we stably transfected P10826 expression vector into an esophageal cancer cell line TE-8 and an antisense P10826 into TE-3 cells . Transfection of P10826 decreased cell growth and colony formation and induced apoptosis in TE-8 cells . Antisense P10826 -transfected TE-3 cells had a shorter doubling time and became resistant to RA . Induction of P10826 decreased P35354 expression in P10826 transfected TE-8 cells , whereas antisense P10826 transfected TE-3 cells increased P35354 expression . The inhibitory effect of P10826 on P35354 expression was further enhanced in the presence of RA , which was blocked by an RAR antagonist . The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide , which does not bind effectively to P10826 , had no effect on P35354 suppression . Furthermore , RA blocked bile acid-induced P35354 expression and prostaglandin E(2) production only in the P10826 positive cells . Our data demonstrated that anticancer effect of P10826 may be related to its ability to suppress P35354 expression and support that the loss of P10826 expression may contribute to esophageal carcinogenesis .
