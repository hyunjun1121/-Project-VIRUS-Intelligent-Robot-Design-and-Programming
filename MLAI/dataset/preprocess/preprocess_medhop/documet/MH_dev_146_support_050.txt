Liver regeneration induced by a designer human P05231 /sIL-6R fusion protein reverses severe hepatocellular injury . The cytokine P05231 plays a significant role in liver regeneration in conjunction with additional growth factors ( P14210 , P01375 , and TGF-alpha ) . Many P05231 effects depend on a naturally occurring soluble P05231 receptor ( sIL-6R ) . Here , the chimeric protein hyper- P05231 , constructed from the human P05231 protein fused to a truncated form of its receptor , was found to have superagonistic P05231 properties , and as such , enhanced liver cell regeneration . Hyper- P05231 reversed the state of hepatotoxicity and enhanced the survival rates of rats suffering from fulminant hepatic failure after D-galactosamine administration . The hyper- P05231 protein has a significant potential for use in the treatment of severe human liver diseases .
