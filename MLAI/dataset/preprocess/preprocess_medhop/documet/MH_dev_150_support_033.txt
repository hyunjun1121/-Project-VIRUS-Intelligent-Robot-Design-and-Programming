The growth hormone dependent serine protease inhibitor , Spi 2.1 inhibits the des ( 1-3 ) insulin-like growth factor-I generating protease . The conversion of insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) to the biologically more active des ( 1-3 ) P05019 variant is catalyzed by a ubiquitous protease . This proteolytic activity is inhibited by human alpha1-antitrypsin and soy-bean trypsin inhibitor and is up-regulated in serum and tissue extracts of hypophysectomized rats . These observations lead us to investigate whether the growth hormone regulated , serine protease inhibitor , Spi 2.1 was able to inhibit the des ( 1-3 ) P05019 generating protease . P00374 deficient Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO(dhfr-ve) ) cells were transfected with a rat Spi 2.1 expression vector containing the dhfr and neomycin resistance gene . Stable transfectants were selected using G418 and amplified using methotrexate . Conditioned medium from Spi 2.1 transfected CHO cells potently inhibited proteolytic activity directed against a synthetic hexa-peptide with a sequence identical to the N-terminal of P05019 . In contrast conditioned medium from wild-type CHO cells had little effect . Based upon these observations we suggest that our previous finding of enhanced des ( 1-3 ) P05019 generating protease activity in growth hormone deficient rats may be , at least partly explained by reduced levels of Spi 2.1 . Furthermore , we propose that the regulation of the generation of des ( 1-3 ) P05019 may be an additional potential site of growth hormone regulation of P05019 action .
