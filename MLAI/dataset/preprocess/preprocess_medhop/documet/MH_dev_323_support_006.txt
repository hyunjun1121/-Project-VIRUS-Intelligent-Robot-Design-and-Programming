Q01718 distribution and modulation among murine mononuclear leukocyte populations . Murine mononuclear leukocytes express adrenocorticotropin ( DB01285 ) receptors that were recognized by a monospecific antiserum to the Q01718 on Y-1 adrenal cells . The antiserum was utilized in an immunofluorescence ( IF ) assay to characterize the distribution of DB01285 receptors on resting murine mononuclear leukocyte populations . Forty-seven percent of spleen cells , 32 % of lymph node cells , and 1 % of thymocytes constitutively expressed DB01285 receptors . Separation of lymphocytes into purified B cell and T cell populations , followed by IF analysis revealed that 47 % of B cells and 23 % of T cells possessed DB01285 receptors . Helper T cells ( P01730 + T cells ) constituted the majority of Q01718 -positive T lymphocytes . Furthermore , 47 % of resident peritoneal macrophages , purified by adherence to plastic , expressed DB01285 receptors . The T-lymphocyte mitogen , concanavalin A , interferon gamma , and DB01285 enhanced Q01718 expression . The differential distribution of Q01718 -positive cells among specific leukocyte populations explains in part why differential cellular responses are observed and implies important regulatory functions for these receptors in the generation or regulation of immune responses .
