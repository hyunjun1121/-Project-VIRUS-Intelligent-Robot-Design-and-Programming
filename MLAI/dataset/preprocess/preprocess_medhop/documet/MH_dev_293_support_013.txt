Oral delivery of P01160 -1186 Q05397 inhibitor decreases tumor growth and spontaneous breast to lung metastasis in pre-clinical models . Tumor metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related death . Focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase recruited to integrin-mediated matrix attachment sites where Q05397 activity is implicated in the control of cell survival , migration , and invasion . Although genetic studies support the importance of Q05397 activity in promoting tumor progression , it remains unclear whether pharmacological Q05397 inhibition prevents tumor metastasis . Here , we show that the Q05397 inhibitor P01160 -1186 blocks Q05397 DB00135 -397 phosphorylation in vivo and exhibits anti-tumor efficacy in orthotopic breast carcinoma mouse tumor models . P01160 -1186 ( 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal , i.p. ) showed promising pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and inhibited tumor Q05397 DB00135 -397 phosphorylation for 12 hours . Oral administration of 150 mg/kg P01160 -1186 gave a more sustained PK profile verses i.p. , and when given twice daily , P01160 -1186 significantly inhibited sygeneic murine 4T1 orthotopic breast carcinoma tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis to lungs . Moreover , low-level 0.5 mg/ml P01160 -1186 ad libitum administration in drinking water prevented oncogenic P01116 - and P15056 -stimulated MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma tumor growth and metastasis with inhibition of tumoral Q05397 and p130Cas phosphorylation . Although P01160 -1186 was not cytotoxic to cells in adherent culture , tumors from animals receiving P01160 -1186 exhibited increased TUNEL staining , decreased leukocyte infiltrate and reduced tumor-associated splenomegaly . In vitro , P01160 -1186 reduced tumor necrosis factor-a triggered interleukin-6 cytokine expression , indicating that Q05397 inhibition may impact tumor progression via effects on both tumor and stromal cells . As oral administration of P01160 -1186 also decreased experimental tumor metastasis , P01160 -1186 may therefore be useful clinically to curb breast tumor progression .
