Comparison of bevacizumab , ranibizumab , and pegaptanib in vitro : efficiency and possible additional pathways . PURPOSE : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) antagonists are the therapy of choice for age-related macular degeneration . DB01270 and pegaptanib have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration , whereas bevacizumab is used off label . In this study , the authors compare these P15692 inhibitors directly regarding their efficiency to neutralize P15692 in a quantifiable in vitro system . METHODS : Porcine retina-retinal pigment epithelium-choroid organ culture and Q96AT9 cell culture were prepared from fresh eyes , cultivated in a perfusion chamber , and treated with clinically relevant concentrations of bevacizumab , ranibizumab and pegaptanib . P15692 content of the supernatant was analyzed with ELISA . Additionally , the influence of bevacizumab and ranibizumab on intracellular P15692 was analyzed with Western blot . RESULTS : At clinically significant doses , bevacizumab ( 0.25 mg/mL ) and ranibizumab ( 0.125 mg/mL ) neutralized P15692 completely for 6 hours , whereas pegaptanib ( 0.08 mg/mL ) showed no effect . DB00112 and ranibizumab neutralized P15692 significantly up to 16 hours . When diluted , bevacizumab lost its inhibiting properties at a concentration of 975 ng/mL , and ranibizumab neutralized P15692 up to a concentration of 120 ng/mL . Both substances significantly diminished P15692 expression in Western blot . CONCLUSIONS : At clinical doses , bevacizumab and ranibizumab are equally potent in neutralizing P15692 . To neutralize P15692 completely in this system , a fraction of the clinical dose is needed . DB01270 is more efficient at neutralizing P15692 when diluted . DB04895 showed no effect in this system , which might help explain the clinical experience regarding this drug . A direct effect of ranibizumab and bevacizumab on P15692 protein expression indicates additional pathways of P15692 inhibitors .
