Identification of candidate small-molecule therapeutics to cancer by gene-signature perturbation in connectivity mapping . Connectivity mapping is a recently developed technique for discovering the underlying connections between different biological states based on gene-expression similarities . The sscMap method has been shown to provide enhanced sensitivity in mapping meaningful connections leading to testable biological hypotheses and in identifying drug candidates with particular pharmacological and/or toxicological properties . Challenges remain , however , as to how to prioritise the large number of discovered connections in an unbiased manner such that the success rate of any following-up investigation can be maximised . We introduce a new concept , gene-signature perturbation , which aims to test whether an identified connection is stable enough against systematic minor changes ( perturbation ) to the gene-signature . We applied the perturbation method to three independent datasets obtained from the GEO database : acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , cervical cancer , and breast cancer treated with letrozole . We demonstrate that the perturbation approach helps to identify meaningful biological connections which suggest the most relevant candidate drugs . In the case of AML , we found that the prevalent compounds were retinoic acids and Q07869 activators . For cervical cancer , our results suggested that potential drugs are likely to involve the P00533 pathway ; and with the breast cancer dataset , we identified candidates that are involved in prostaglandin inhibition . Thus the gene-signature perturbation approach added real values to the whole connectivity mapping process , allowing for increased specificity in the identification of possible therapeutic candidates .
