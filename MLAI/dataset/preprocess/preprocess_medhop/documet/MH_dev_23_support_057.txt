DB01169 inhibits cell proliferation and human papillomavirus oncogene expression in cervical cancer cells . DB01169 ( As2O3 ) has shown therapeutic effects in some leukemias and solid cancers . However , the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer efficacy have not been clearly elucidated , particularly in solid cancers . Our previous data showed that As2O3 induced apoptosis of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 DNA-immortalized human cervical epithelial cells and cervical cancer cells and inhibited the expression of HPV oncogenes in these cells . In the present study , we systemically examined the effects of As2O3 on five human cervical cancer cell lines and explored the possible molecular mechanisms . MTT assay showed that HPV-negative C33A cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition induced by As2O3 than HPV-positive cervical cancer cells , and HPV 18-positive HeLa and C4-I cells were more sensitive to As2O3 than HPV 16-positive CaSki and SiHa cells . After As2O3 treatment , both mRNA and protein levels of HPV E6 and E7 obviously decreased in all HPV positive cell lines . In contrast , p53 and Rb protein levels increased in all tested cell lines . P05412 protein expression decreased significantly in HeLa , CaSki and C33A cells with ELISA method . These results suggest that As2O3 is a potential anticancer drug for cervical cancer .
