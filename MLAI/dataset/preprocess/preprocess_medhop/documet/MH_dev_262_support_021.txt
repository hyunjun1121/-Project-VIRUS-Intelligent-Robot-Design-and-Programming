Recommendations for the treatment of Crohn 's disease with tumor necrosis factor antagonists : an expert consensus report . BACKGROUND : Symptom relief is the traditional treatment goal in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . New goals including mucosal healing and bowel preservation are now achievable with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists . DB00065 and adalimumab are approved as second-line treatments for severe , active CD . DB08904 is approved only in the U.S. and Switzerland as second-line treatment for moderate-to-severe , active CD . Data from trials of infliximab suggest that high-risk patients and patients with active inflammation ( CRP elevation and/or ileocolonic ulcers ) may benefit from earlier use of this drug . METHODS : A Delphi survey was used to obtain consensus on issues surrounding bowel preservation and use of P01375 antagonists . At the time of this survey , infliximab was the only P01375 antagonist approved for the treatment of CD in Europe , Canada , and Australia . An expert panel of 12 gastroenterologists with substantial clinical experience using infliximab in clinical practice and trials in these areas participated . RESULTS : The experts agreed that bowel preservation and mucosal healing are relevant and achievable goals , and form a rationale for using P01375 antagonists in CD patients . Control of inflammation and induction of mucosal healing were considered essential for bowel preservation . Consensus areas : 1 ) mucosal healing is predictive of improved long-term disease course and increases the likelihood of steroid-free remission ; 2 ) infliximab induces sustained mucosal healing , promotes bowel preservation , and reduces hospitalizations and surgeries ; 3 ) benefits of infliximab in relation to mucosal healing , bowel preservation , and clinical remission increase when therapy is initiated earlier . CONCLUSIONS : Treatment with P01375 antagonists helps preserve the bowel in CD patients .
