Characterization of the interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with protein kinase C . DB05013 ( I3A ) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus , which has been used in traditional medicine . Here , we report the initial characterization of I3A as a protein kinase C ( PKC ) ligand . I3A bound to P17252 in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity ; however , under these assay conditions , little PKC isoform selectivity was observed . PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) in WEHI-231 , Q9BPY8 -92 , and Colo-205 cells . In all of the three cell types , I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA . In intact CHO- P04264 cells , I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms , visualized by confocal microscopy , with equal or higher potency than PMA . PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA . I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction . I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids , compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol , and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents , measured by surface plasmon resonance . The in vitro kinase activity of P17252 induced by I3A was lower than that induced by PMA . The novel pattern of behavior of I3A makes it of great interest for further evaluation .
