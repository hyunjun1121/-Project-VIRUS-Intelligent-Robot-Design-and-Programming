Serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) levels after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . P14174 ( MIF ) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) , as MIF plays an important role to regulate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , one of the inflammatory cytokines which induces and exacerbates aGVHD . We examined the association between serum MIF levels and aGVHD vs. chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) in allo- P09683 patients in this study . We found a significant increase in the peak serum MIF ( 14.46 ng +/- 1.47 ng/ml ) at onset in patients that developed aGVHD ( n = 23 , P = 0.009 ) . We also found that mean serum MIF levels in patients who developed extensive type cGVHD within 6 months ( 12.58 +/- 2.18 ng/ml , n = 13 ) were significantly higher than MIF levels before allo-HSCT ( 7.86 +/- 1.17 ng/ml , n = 19 , P = 0.04 ) . Therefore , we speculated that serum MIF levels increase during the active phase of both aGVHD and cGVHD .
