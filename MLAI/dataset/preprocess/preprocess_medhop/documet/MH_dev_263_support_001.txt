[ Anticoagulants of primary haemostasis ] . Inhibition of platelet function plays an important role in the treatment and secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular ischemic diseases . Established antiplatelet agents use different pharmacological targets for this role . Acetyl salicylic acid achieves a reduction of thromboxane A2 formation by inhibition of P23219 . DB00208 or clopidogrel are ADP- Q9H244 receptor antagonists . Tirofiban , abciximab or eptifibatid are used for the inhibition of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor which is activated at the surface of platelets preceding the final step of their aggregation . The mechanism of dipyridamole is based on the inhibition of adenosine uptake and of phosphodiesterase-5 . Efforts are made to improve antiplatelet therapy with the aim to find agents with favorable clinical outcome and lower bleeding risk . Current clinical studies focus on a new generation of ADP receptor antagonists ( prasugrel , cangrelor and ticagrelor ) as successors of ticlopidine and clopidogrel after coronary arterial interventions . Developments using platelet targets different from established drugs are thrombin receptor antagonists ( like SCH530348 ) or thromboxane receptor antagonists ( like S18886/terutroban ) in patients with cerebrovascular events . Results from recent experimental studies could lead to new strategies for antiplatelet therapy ( like inhibition of GP Ib receptor , GP VI receptor , platelet-leukocyte interaction , factor XII and others ) in the future .
