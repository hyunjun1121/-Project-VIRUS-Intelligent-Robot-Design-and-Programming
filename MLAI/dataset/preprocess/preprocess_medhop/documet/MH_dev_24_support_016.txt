Lack of direct action of atriopeptidase inhibitor on cellular pH regulation in rabbit S2 proximal straight tubules . While the in vivo diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the newly-developed drug DB00616 ( UK-79300 ) , a prodrug of a selective atriopeptidase inhibitor UK-73967 ( DB00058 ) are well established , the mechanism of its diuretic action is not yet fully understood due to the lack of information about its direct effects on proximal tubules . To elucidate whether this atriopeptidase inhibitor has any direct effects on proximal tubules , we examined the effect of DB00058 on intracellular pH ( pHi ) of the in vitro microperfused proximal S2 segment of rabbit kidney , using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye , (2',7')-bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein ( BCECF ) . In the steady-state condition , pHi was 7.13 +/- 0.02 ( n = 19 ) . P08473 inhibitor ( DB00058 ) at 100 microM added to the bath changed pHi by only 0.02 +/- 0.07 unit ( n = 7 , p > 0.05 ) in 10 min . The same concentration of DB00058 in the lumen changed pHi by 0.03 +/- 0.02 unit ( n = 6 , p > 0.05 ) . To test whether the synergistic effects of DB00058 on the luminal and basolateral transport systems prevented the apparent change in pHi , we also examined the effect of DB00058 in the presence of amiloride in the lumen . The inhibition of Na+/H+ antiporter by the addition of 1 mM of amiloride to the lumen caused no change in pHi response to basolateral DB00058 application . DB00058 was without effect on pHi also in the presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide ( P01160 ) . These results suggest that DB00058 per se has no significant effect on the process of proximal acidification over a short time period .
