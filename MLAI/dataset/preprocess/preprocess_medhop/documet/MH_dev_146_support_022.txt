P02649 does not predict poor outcome 1 year after ischemic stroke . OBJECTIVES : The apolipoprotein E gene ( P02649 ) polymorphism may influence outcome in various forms of brain injury . The association between P02649 genotype and long-term ischemic stroke ( IS ) outcome is controversial . We have examined the effect of stroke risk factors , clinical status at admission and P02649 genotype on survival and dependency 1 year after IS . METHODS : We investigated 496 consecutively subjects with IS . Information concerning risk factors and clinical data were collected prospectively . Functional dependency was estimated with modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) and defined as a score of 3-5 . Each patient was offered a I year follow-up evaluation . P02649 genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) method . Multivariate regression models were used to analyse predictors of death and poor outcome ( death or dependency ) within 1 year after the stroke . RESULTS : The distribution ofAPOE genotypes was 69 % with genotype E3/E3 , 18 % with genotype P13726 / E4 , 12 % with genotype E2/13 and 1 % with genotype F2/14 . At year 1 , 169 patients ( 38 % ) had died and 78 of the survivors ( 28 % ) were functionally dependent . The best predictors of death at year 1 were : age over 70 years , congestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation , disturbed consciousness and severe hand paresis . Poor outcome was independently predicted by : age over 70 years , congestive heart failure , pre-stroke mRS > or =3 , marked disturbance of consciousness and severe hand paresis . CONCLUSION : We did not find any impact of P02649 genotype on mortality or poor outcome 1 year after IS .
