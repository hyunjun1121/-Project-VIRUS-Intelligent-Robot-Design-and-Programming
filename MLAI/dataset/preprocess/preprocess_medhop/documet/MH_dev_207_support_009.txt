A meta-analysis of antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins in pediatric patients with fever and neutropenia . BACKGROUND : Antipseudomonal penicillins ( P05067 ) and antipseudomonal cephalosporins ( P25054 ) play important roles in the management of pediatric patients with fever and neutropenia ( FN ) . Our primary objective was to describe the risk of treatment failure in children treated with an P05067 or P25054 as initial empiric therapy for FN . Our secondary objectives were to compare P05067 with P25054 and third- with fourth-generation P25054 as initial empiric therapy in this population . METHODS : We performed electronic searches of Ovid Medline , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , limiting studies to prospective pediatric trials in FN in which at least 1 treatment arm consisted of an P05067 or P25054 antibiotic with or without an aminoglycoside . Data abstraction was conducted by 2 independent reviewers . RESULTS : From 7281 reviewed articles , 41 studies comprising 51 treatment regimens were included in the meta-analysis . Treatment failure , including antibiotic modification , occurred in 34 % and 41 % of patients treated with P05067 and P25054 monotherapy , respectively , and 41 % and 33 % of patients treated with P05067 - and P25054 -aminoglycoside combination therapy , respectively . There were no statistically significant differences in treatment failure including modification , mortality , or adverse events when comparing P05067 with P25054 monotherapy , P05067 with P25054 combination therapy , or third- with fourth-generation P25054 therapy . CONCLUSIONS : Our meta-analysis suggests that P05067 and P25054 monotherapy , as well as combination therapy with an aminoglycoside , are efficacious and safe therapeutic options for the empiric management of pediatric patients with FN . Specific antibiotic selection should be based on other important factors , such as cost , availability , and local epidemiologic and resistance patterns .
