O15554 channels participate in the EMT induced by O75365 in colorectal cancer . Studies have shown that phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 ( O75365 ) promotes the invasion , migration , and metastasis of human tumor cells by facilitating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . However , the mechanism by which O75365 induces tumor cell EMT is unknown . Our previous research revealed that O75365 promotes LoVo cell proliferation by up-regulating O15554 channels . In the current study , we explored the mechanism by which O75365 mediates EMT . We demonstrated that O75365 induced the expression of O15554 channels , leading to EMT and the down-regulation of P12830 . Further studies revealed that O15554 channels increased intracellular calcium levels and activated components of cell signaling downstream of calcium , including P62158 -kinase II and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta ( P49841 ) , which increased Snail expression . Inhibiting O15554 with siRNA and TRAM-34 , a specific inhibitor , restored P12830 expression and inhibited Snail expression . These results implicated the up-regulation of O15554 channels in the O75365 -mediated induction of EMT and promotion of cancer metastasis .
