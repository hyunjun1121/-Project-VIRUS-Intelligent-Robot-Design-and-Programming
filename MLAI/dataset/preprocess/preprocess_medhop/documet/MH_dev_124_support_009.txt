Reversal of P-glycoprotein and multidrug-resistance protein-mediated drug resistance in KB cells by 5-O-benzoylated taxinine K . A newly synthesized taxoid originally from the Japanese yew Taxus cuspidata , 5-O-benzoylated taxinine K ( Q06187 ) was examined for its ability to reverse P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) and multidrug resistance protein ( MRP ) -mediated multidrug resistance . Q06187 reversed the resistance to paclitaxel , doxorubicin ( P35318 ) , and vincristine ( VCR ) of KB-8-5 and KB- P06681 cells that overexpress P-gp by directly interacting with P-gp . Q06187 also moderately reversed the resistance to P35318 of KB/MRP cells that overexpress MRP . However , Q06187 neither inhibited the transporting activity of MRP nor reduced intracellular glutathione levels in KB/MRP cells . Q06187 shifted the distribution of P35318 in KB/MRP cells from punctate cytoplasmic compartments to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm by inhibiting acidification of cytoplasmic organelles . These two functions of Q06187 make it able to reverse both P-gp- and MRP-mediated MDR . Q06187 in combination with P35318 should be useful for treating patients with tumors that overexpress both P-gp and MRP .
