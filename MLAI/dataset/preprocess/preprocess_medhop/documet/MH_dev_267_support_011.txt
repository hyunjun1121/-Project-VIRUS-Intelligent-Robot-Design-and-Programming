DB06096 , a selective P29475 inhibitor and a P28222 /1D receptor agonist , inhibits P80511 release in preclinical migraine models . BACKGROUND : DB06096 is a combined neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( P29475 ) inhibitor and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D ( P28222 /1D ) receptor agonist . Using preclinical models , we evaluated whether these two unique therapeutic principles have a synergistic effect in attenuating stimulated calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) release , a marker of trigeminal activation . METHODS : We examined the effect of DB06096 on : ( 1 ) DB00761 - , capsaicin- and resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) -induced immunoreactive P80511 ( iCGRP ) release from isolated preparation of rat dura mater , trigeminal ganglion ( TG ) and trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( P24821 ) ; and ( 2 ) capsaicin- and electrical stimulation ( ES ) -induced middle meningeal artery ( MMA ) dilation in a rat closed-cranial window . RESULTS : DB06096 inhibited : ( 1 ) DB00761 -stimulated iCGRP release from dura mater ( % decrease mean ± SEM , lowest effective concentration ) ( 35 ± 6 % , 30 µM ) , TG ( 24 ± 11 % , 10 µM ) and P24821 ( 40 ± 8 % , 10 µM ) ; ( 2 ) capsaicin- and RTX-induced iCGRP release from dura mater ; and ( 3 ) capsaicin- and ES-induced increase in dural artery diameter ( 32 ± 5 % , 3 mg kg(-1) intravenous ( i.v. ) and 36 ± 1 % , 10 mg kg(-1) i.v. ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB06096 inhibits P80511 release from migraine-relevant cephalic tissues . Its effect is most likely mediated via a combination of P29475 -inhibition and P28222 /1D receptor agonism in dura mater while the mechanisms of action for inhibition of P80511 release from TG and P24821 have to be investigated further .
