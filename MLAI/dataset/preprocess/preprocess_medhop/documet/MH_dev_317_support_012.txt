Sp1 is required for the early response of alpha2(I) collagen to transforming growth factor-beta1 . It is currently debated whether P05412 or Sp1 is the factor that mediates transforming growth factor beta1 ( TGF-beta ) stimulation of the human alpha2(I) collagen ( P08123 ) gene by binding to an upstream promoter element ( TbRE ) . The present study was designed to resolve this controversy by correlating expression of P08123 , P05412 , and Sp1 in the same cell line and under different experimental conditions . The results strongly indicate that Sp1 is required for the immediate early response of P08123 to TGF-beta and P05412 is not . The Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin blocked stimulation of alpha2(I) collagen mRNA accumulation by TGF-beta , whereas the P05412 inhibitor curcumin had no effect . Furthermore , antibodies against Jun-B and c-Jun failed to identify immunologically related proteins in the TbRE-bound complex , irrespective of whether they were purified from untreated or TGF-beta-treated cells . P05412 did bind to the TbRE probe in vitro , but only in the absence of the upstream Sp1 recognition sequence . Based on this finding and DNA transfection results , we conclude that the P05412 sequence of the TbRE represents a cryptic site used under experimental conditions that either eliminate the more favorable Sp1 binding site or force the balance toward the less probable . Finally , a combination of cell transfections and DNA-binding assays excluded that P08123 transactivation involves the retinoblastoma gene product ( P06400 ) , an activator of Sp1 , the P06400 -related protein P28749 , an inhibitor of Sp1 , or the Sp1-related repressor , Sp3 .
