A Minireview on DB00067 -regulated P41181 in Kidney Collecting Duct Cells . The kidney collecting duct is an important renal tubular segment for the regulation of body water and salt homeostasis . DB09145 reabsorption in the collecting duct cells is regulated by arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) via the vasopressin V2-receptor ( P30518 ) . AVP increases the osmotic water permeability of the collecting duct cells through aquaporin-2 ( P41181 ) and aquaporin-3 ( Q92482 ) . AVP induces the apical targeting of P41181 and transcription of P41181 gene in the kidney collecting duct principal cells . The signaling transduction pathways resulting in the P41181 trafficking to the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct principal cells , include P41181 phosphorylation , RhoA phosphorylation , actin depolymerization and calcium mobilization , and the changes of P41181 protein abundance in water balance disorders have been extensively studied . These studies elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of body water homeostasis and provide the basis for the treatment of body water balance disorders .
