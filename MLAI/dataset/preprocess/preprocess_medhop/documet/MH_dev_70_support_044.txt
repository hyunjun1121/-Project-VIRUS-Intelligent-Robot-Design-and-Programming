Suppression of tumor growth and metastasis by a P17948 antagonizing peptide identified from a phage display library . Although the P15692 -Flk-1-pathway has been known as the major driving force of angiogenesis , new evidence has shown that P17948 /Flt-1 plays important roles during the neovascularization under pathological conditions including tumor , atherosclerosis and arthritis . In search of Flt-1 receptor antagonizing peptides , we screened a phage display 12-mer-peptide library with recombinant Flt-1 protein . Seven candidate peptides were identified that specifically bound to P15692 receptor Flt-1 , of which peptide F56 ( WHSDMEWWYLLG ) almost abolished P15692 binding to receptor Flt-1 in vitro . In vivo , F56 fused with P00374 ( P00374 -F56 ) inhibited angiogenesis in a P62158 assay . Moreover , P00374 -F56 significantly inhibited the growth of nodules of human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 in BALB/c nude mice . Histological analyses showed that necrosis of the implanted tumor was markedly enhanced following treatment with P00374 -F56 . In the severe combined immunodeficiency disease ( SCID ) mouse model for studying metastasis of the human breast cancer cell line BICR-H1 , synthetic peptide F56 significantly inhibited tumor growth and lung metastases . Taken together , our results have demonstrated that peptide F56 , as a Flt-1 receptor antagonist , fulfilled the antiangiogenic and antimetastatic effects by specifically interfering with the interaction between P15692 and receptor Flt-1 . Thus , short peptide F56 may have clinical potential in tumor therapy .
