Decreased expression of histamine H1 and H4 receptors suggests disturbance of local regulation in human colorectal tumours by histamine . Production of histamine in colon tumours has been described earlier . DB11320 -mediated signals have been shown to be implicated in tumour growth , and the effects of histamine are largely determined locally by the histamine receptor expression pattern . We analysed histamine receptor expression in human colorectal cancer , adenoma and normal mucosa by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , Western blot analysis and immunostaining . Real-time RT-PCR results revealed significantly decreased ( p < 0.001 ) P35367 and Q9H3N8 mRNA levels in tumours compared to normal colonic mucosa , without any significant change in P25021 mRNA expression . Q9Y5N1 was absent in most samples ; it was detected at low levels in 7.9 % of the cases . Protein analysis showed a similar decrease in histamine receptor expression in carcinoma and adenoma compared to normal mucosa controls . Based on these results , we performed further Western blot analysis on Dukes-classified and -selected tumour samples . We found significantly decreased Q9H3N8 levels in neoplastic samples compared to normal colonic tissue , but there was no significant correlation between histamine receptor expression profile and the Dukes stage of tumours . Immunohistochemical staining revealed expression patterns of P35367 , P25021 and Q9H3N8 similar to those suggested by the mRNA and Western blot results . In the present study , we demonstrate that P35367 , P25021 and Q9H3N8 are expressed in colon carcinoma and the adjacent normal mucosa . The results suggest a dramatic alteration in the distribution of histamine receptors in colon cancer . These findings raise the perspective of targeted pharmacological studies with selective histamine receptor antagonists or agonists in the therapy of colorectal tumours .
