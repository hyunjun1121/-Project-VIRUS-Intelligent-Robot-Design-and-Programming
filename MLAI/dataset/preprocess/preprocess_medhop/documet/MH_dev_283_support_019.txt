Antibody mediated rejection associated with complement factor h-related protein 3/1 deficiency successfully treated with eculizumab . Antibody mediated rejection ( AMR ) activates the classical complement pathway and can be detrimental to graft survival . AMR can be accompanied by thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) . DB01257 , a monoclonal P01031 antibody prevents induction of the terminal complement cascade ( TCC ) and has recently emerged as a therapeutic option for AMR . We present a highly sensitized 13-year-old female with end-stage kidney disease secondary to spina bifida-associated reflux nephropathy , who developed severe steroid- , ATG- and plasmapheresis-resistant AMR with TMA 1 week post second kidney transplant despite previous desensitization therapy with immunoglobulin infusions . DB01257 rescue therapy resulted in a dramatic improvement in biochemical ( P01024 ; creatinine ) and hematological ( platelets ) parameters within 6 days . The patient was proven to be deficient in complement Factor H-related protein 3/1 ( Q02985 /1 ) , a plasma protein that regulates the complement cascade at the level of P01031 conversion and has been involved in the pathogenesis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by P08603 autoantibodies ( DEAP-HUS ) . Q03591 deficiency may have worsened the severe clinical progression of AMR and possibly contributed to the development of donor-specific antibodies . Thus , screening for Q02985 /1 deficiency should be considered in patients with severe AMR associated with TMA .
