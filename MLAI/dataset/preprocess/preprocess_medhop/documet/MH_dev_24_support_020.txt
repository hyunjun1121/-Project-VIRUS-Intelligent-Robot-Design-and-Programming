The deletion variant of α2b-adrenergic receptor is associated with decreased risk in Alzheimer 's disease and mild cognitive impairment . A common genetic polymorphism of the α2b-adrenergic receptor ( P18089 ) resulting in a deletion of three glutamic acids located on the third intracellular loop of the protein , has been associated with memory formation enhanced by emotional events . Additionally , there are several studies documenting the involvement of this polymorphism in other types of cognition , such as episodic memory . The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship of this genetic variance with a common memory affecting disease , Alzheimer 's disease . Our study was carried out in a total number of 311 Greek subjects , including 119 sporadic AD patients , 95 D6RGH6 cases and 97 controls . Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and the fragments containing the polymorphism were amplified by PCR analysis . A genotypic analysis of the P02649 polymorphism was also carried out . A significant difference in the frequency of the P18089 genetic variation among the three groups was observed . Specifically , the deletion variant is more prevalent in controls than in AD and D6RGH6 patients . Our data demonstrate for the first time an independent contribution of the P18089 genetic polymorphism to memory impairment and we further suggest a possible protective role of the deletion variant against the disease development .
