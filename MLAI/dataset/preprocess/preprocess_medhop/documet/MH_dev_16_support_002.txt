Gene expression and molecular changes in cerebral arteries following subarachnoid hemorrhage in the rat . OBJECT : The authors investigated early changes in the cerebral arteries of rats that occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage ( Q53FZ2 ) . METHODS : Messenger RNA was investigated by performing microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analyses , and protein expression was shown by performing immunohistochemical studies . The array data indicated that the initial processes that occur after Q53FZ2 involve activation of genes involved in angiogenesis , inflammation , and extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) remodeling . The real-time PCR investigation confirmed upregulation of genes that were observed using the microarray to be regulated , including P35228 , P45452 , and cxcl2 . The authors also verified the upregulation of previously implicated genes for G-protein-coupled receptors ( endothelin B [ ETB ] , angiotensin 1 [ AT1 ] , and P50052 ) and metalloproteinase 9 . The results of an immunohistochemical study confirmed that receptor genes that were seen to be regulated produced an increase in protein expression . Double immunostaining of rat cerebral arteries with endothelial cell- or smooth-muscle cell-specific antibodies verified that an increase in ETB , 5-hydrotryptamine ( P28222 ) , and P28221 receptor expression occurs in smooth-muscle cells . CONCLUSIONS : Processes occurring after Q53FZ2 lead to enhanced arterial contractility and Q13201 remodeling either directly or through angiogenesis and inflammation . These processes are active via an increase in metalloproteinase expression , the presence of proangiogenic factors , and the expression of proinflammatory genes .
