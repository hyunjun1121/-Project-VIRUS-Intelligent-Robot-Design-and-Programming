The role of celecoxib in Rad51 expression and cell survival affected by gefitinib in human non-small cell lung cancer cells . Celecoxib ( DB00482 ) is a cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) selective inhibitor and gefitinib ( DB00317 (R) , ZD1839 ) is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor for human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The addition of celecoxib to gefitinib to prolong the survival of patients with NSCLC still remains controversial and needs to be investigated . The Rad51 protein is essential for homologous recombination repair , and is overexpressed in chemo- or radioresistant carcinomas . In this study , we characterize the role of celecoxib in the cytotoxicity , P27361 /2 activation and Rad51 expression affected by gefitinib in NSCLC cells . We show that celecoxib can enhance the cytotoxicity induced by gefitinib in NSCLC cells . Treatment with celecoxib alone has no effect on the P27361 /2 activation , Rad51 mRNA and protein levels , however , combined treatment with gefitinib results in a significant reduction of phospho- P27361 /2 and Rad51 protein levels , and triggers the degradation of Rad51 via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway . Expression of constitutively active Q02750 /2 vectors ( Q02750 /2-CA ) significantly rescues the decreased P27361 /2 activity , and restores Rad51 protein levels and cell survival under co-treatment with gefitinib and celecoxib . Furthermore , blocking P27361 /2 activation by U0126 ( Q02750 /2 inhibitor ) and knocking down Rad51 expression by transfection with small interfering RNA of Rad51 can enhance the cytotoxicity of celecoxib .
