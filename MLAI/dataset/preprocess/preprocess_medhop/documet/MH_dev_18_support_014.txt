DB00644 antagonist in the management of prostate cancer . DB00044 -releasing hormone ( P01148 ) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer . When treatment is started , P01148 agonists initially stimulate the release of LH , causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a " flare " phenomenon or worsening of disease , particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration . DB00106 is a pure P30968 antagonist that is devoid of any P01148 agonist activity . Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that abarelix produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge , as compared with P01148 agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist . The safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment , but the lack of testosterone surge with abarelix might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare .
