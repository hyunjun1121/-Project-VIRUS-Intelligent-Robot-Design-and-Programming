P23458 activates P40763 activity in non-small-cell lung cancer cells and P05231 neutralizing antibodies can suppress P23458 - P40763 signaling . Members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( P35610 ) family of transcription factors are potential targets for the treatment and prevention of cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer . P35610 proteins can be phosphorylated and activated by diverse upstream kinases including cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinases . We examined P35610 protein activation in lung cancer cell lines including those with activating mutations in the P00533 and examined upstream kinases responsible for P40763 phosphorylation and activation using small molecules , antibodies , and RNA interference . We found more pronounced P40763 activation in cells with activating P00533 mutations , yet inhibition of P00533 activity had no effect on P40763 activation . Inhibition of P23458 with small molecules or RNA interference resulted in loss of P40763 tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of cell growth . An interleukin-6 neutralizing antibody , siltuximab ( CNTO 328 ) could inhibit P40763 tyrosine phosphorylation in a cell-dependent manner . DB09036 could completely inhibit P40763 tyrosine phosphorylation in H1650 cells , and this resulted in inhibition of lung cancer cell growth in vivo . Combined P00533 inhibition with erlotinib and siltuximab resulted in dual inhibition of both tyrosine and serine P40763 phosphorylation , more pronounced inhibition of P40763 transcriptional activity , and translated into combined effects on lung cancer growth in a mouse model . Our results suggest that P23458 is responsible for P40763 activation in lung cancer cells and that indirect attacks on P23458 - P40763 using an P05231 neutralizing antibody with or without P00533 inhibition can inhibit lung cancer growth in lung cancer subsets .
