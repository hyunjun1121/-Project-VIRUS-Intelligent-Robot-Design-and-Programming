DB01169 induces apoptosis through JNK and P29323 in human mesothelioma cells . Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive tumor of serosal surfaces , which is refractory to current treatment options . DB01169 ( As2O3 ) is used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia , and also to inhibit proliferation of several solid tumors including hepatoma , esophageal , and gastric cancer in vitro . Here we found that As2O3 inhibited cell viability of a mesothelioma cell line , NCI-H2052 . As2O3 induced apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells , which was accompanied by activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 , and caspase-3 . zVAD-fmk , a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor , inhibited As2O3-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 , but not that of P45983 /2 and P27361 /2 . Small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) targeting P45983 /2 suppressed As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis , indicating that P45983 /2 regulate As2O3-induced apoptosis though caspase cascade . Furthermore , P45983 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced P45984 phosphorylation and P45984 siRNA abrogated As2O3-induced P45983 phosphorylation , suggesting that P45983 and P45984 interact with each other . Moreover , P45983 siRNA , but not P45984 siRNA , abrogated As2O3-induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation . P45984 siRNA together with PD98059 , a specific MAPK/ P29323 kinase inhibitor , suppressed As2O3-induced apoptosis more significantly than P45984 siRNA alone . These results indicated that As2O3 induces apoptosis of NCI-H2052 cells mainly through P45983 /2 activation , and that P27361 /2 is involved in As2O3-induced apoptosis when P45983 /2 are inactivated .
