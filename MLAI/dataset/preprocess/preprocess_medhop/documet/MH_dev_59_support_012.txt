Statins control oxidized LDL-mediated histone modifications and gene expression in cultured human endothelial cells . OBJECTIVE : Activation of the endothelium by oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis . Histone modifications impact on the transcriptional activity state of genes . We tested the hypothesis that oxLDL-induced inflammatory gene expression is regulated by histone modifications and experienced the effect of statins on these alterations . METHODS AND RESULTS : OxLDL-related interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) and monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) secretion in endothelial cells was reduced by statins but enhanced by histone deacetylase inhibitors . OxLDL induced lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) and extracellular regulated kinases ( P27361 /2 ) -dependent acetylation of histone H3 and H4 as well as phosphorylation of histone H3 , both globally and on the promoters of il8 and mcp1 . Pretreatment of oxLDL-exposed cells with statins reduced the above mentioned histone modification , as well as recruitment of CREB binding protein ( CBP ) 300 , NF-kappaB , and of RNA polymerase II but prevented loss of binding of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) -1 and -2 at the il8 and mcp1 gene promoters . OxLDL reduced Q13547 and 2 expression , and statins partly restored global HDAC-activity . Statin-related effects were reverted with mevalonate . In situ experiments indicated decreased expression of Q92769 in endothelial cells in atherosclerotic plaques of human coronary arteries . CONCLUSIONS : Histone modifications seem to play an important role in atherosclerosis .
