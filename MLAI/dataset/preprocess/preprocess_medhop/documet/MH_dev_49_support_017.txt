Transformed 3T3 cells have reduced levels and altered subcellular distribution of the major PKC substrate protein P29966 . The P29966 ( myristylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate ) protein is an abundant calmodulin-binding protein that is a major and specific endogenous substrate of protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Stimulation of cells with phorbol esters or other activators of PKC has been shown previously to result in rapid phosphorylation of P29966 proteins and redistribution of these myristylated C-kinase substrates from membrane to cytosol . Here we show that NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts transformed by P38936 -HA-C- DB01367 or pp60-V- P12931 oncoproteins have markedly reduced levels of p68- P29966 and that most of the remaining P29966 protein is found in the cytosol . 3T3 cells containing a nontransforming oncoprotein Q9Y3Q3 - P10415 , in contrast , exhibited normal levels and distribution of p68- P29966 . When taken together with recent evidence that P29966 proteins are involved in regulating organization of the membrane cytoskeleton , our findings suggest that oncoprotein-mediated alterations in P29966 protein levels and subcellular distribution may contribute to the development or maintenance of the transformed phenotype .
