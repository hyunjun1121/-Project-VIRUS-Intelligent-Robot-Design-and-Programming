Effects of cyclosporin and FK-506 on glomerular mesangial cells . Evidence for direct inhibition of thromboxane synthase by low cyclosporin concentrations . The cellular sources or molecular mechanisms responsible for the derangement of vasoactive prostanoid levels during immunosuppressive cyclosporin ( Q13216 ) therapy have not been defined . Using cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells ( MC ) , the cytostatic , cytotoxic and prostanoid synthesis modulating effects of Q13216 and FK-506 have been measured and compared with the immunosuppressive action of these drugs . Both , Q13216 and FK-506 inhibited proliferation of MC at similar doses ( IC50 approximately 1 microgram.ml-1 ) . Lymphoproliferation was suppressed with IC50s of 50 ng.ml-1 and < 1 ng.ml-1 , respectively . In contrast , and unlike FK-506 , Q13216 caused mesangiolysis ( IC50 = 4.5 micrograms.ml-1 ) and concentration dependently inhibited the interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) stimulated mesangial cell release of TXB2 at nanomolar doses ( IC50 = 50 ng.ml-1 ) . In kinetic experiments ( 6-48 h ) , Q13216 1 ng.ml-1 partially and 1 microgram.ml-1 completely abolished the P01584 augmented mesangial secretion TXB2 at all the time points tested . Both , low and high doses of Q13216 reduced DB00917 release by only 20-40 % and then not until at least 24 h of incubation . Measuring enzymatic capacity of membrane fractions of MC to generate TXB2 or DB00917 from added arachidonic acid ( 10(-5) M ) , Q13216 ( 0.1-1000 ng.ml-1 ) caused a dose dependent reduction in cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) /thromboxane synthase activity up to 76 % , while DB00917 synthesis ( P36551 /prostaglandin synthase ) was decreased by 34 % . Immunoblots with a specific P23219 antiserum revealed that P23219 protein expression of MC was not affected by Q13216 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
