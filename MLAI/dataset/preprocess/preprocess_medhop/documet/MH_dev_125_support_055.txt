Chemotactic and cytotoxic effects of minocycline on human retinal pigment epithelial cells . PURPOSE : To reveal the effects of minocycline , an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent , on the viability and physiological properties of retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells and to compare the effects with those of triamcinolone acetonide . METHODS : The proliferation of human Q96AT9 cells in vitro was investigated with a bromodeoxyuridine immunoassay ; chemotaxis was examined with a Boyden chamber assay . Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion . The gene expression of growth factors and P14780 was determined with real-time RT-PCR , and the secretion of P15692 was examined with ELISA . The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and P27361 /2 proteins was determined with Western blot analysis . RESULTS : DB01017 at low concentrations ( 50 nM-20 microM ) stimulated chemotaxis and decreased the proliferation of Q96AT9 cells . DB01017 at high concentrations ( above 5 microM ) decreased the viability of Q96AT9 cells through the induction of cell necrosis . The chemotactic effect of minocycline was mediated by the stimulation of autocrine PDGF signaling and the activation of p38 MAPK . DB01017 promoted the expression of PDGF-B , P14210 , P15692 , and P14780 and increased the amounts of phosphorylated p38 and P27361 /2 proteins in Q96AT9 cells . DB00620 reduced PDGF-evoked chemotaxis and P15692 expression and secretion and had no significant effects on cell viability and proliferation . DB00620 did not reverse the effects of minocycline on cell proliferation , chemotaxis , or viability or the expression of P15692 . CONCLUSIONS : Low-dose minocycline induces the activation of Q96AT9 cells , as indicated by the activation of p38 and P27361 /2 and by enhanced chemotaxis mediated by autocrine PDGF signaling . High-dose minocycline induces Q96AT9 cell degeneration .
