DB00197 antagonizes tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced reprogramming of adipocyte gene expression by inhibiting the transcriptional regulatory functions of NF-kappaB . DB00197 ( Q96PF1 ) , a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) agonist , restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo . The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood . Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between P37231 and NF-kappaB in adipocytes . We show that Q96PF1 selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes . This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression , activation , nuclear translocation , or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals . Notably , the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by P37231 activation . In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells , ectopic expression of P37231 abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit ( RelA ) of NF-kappaB , and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of Q96PF1 . Conversely , overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a P37231 -responsive reporter gene by activated P37231 in a dose-dependent manner . The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region . Other NF-kappaB family members , p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65 , blocked P37231 -mediated gene transcription less effectively . Thus , p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of P37231 in adipocytes , and P37231 activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes . Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which P37231 agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes .
