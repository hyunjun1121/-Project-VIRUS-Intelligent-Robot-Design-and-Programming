Postprandial cell defense system responses to meal formulations : stratification through gene expression profiling . SCOPE : Cell defenses regulating homeostatic control of postprandial stress are influenced by interindividual variation , food composition and health status . This study investigates effects of food composition on individual postprandial responses and associations with health . METHODS AND RESULTS : Volunteers ( n = 16 ) consumed four food formulations ( 50 % unsaturated/saturated fat , with/without beetroot extract 10 g/100 g ) on separate occasions . GeXP assay measured whole blood postprandial gene expression profiles of 28 cell defense markers at baseline and postprandial time points 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 h . Plasma markers of metabolic lipids , hormones , inflammatory cytokines , oxidative stress , and DNA damage/repair were also assessed . SIRT 1 , P55851 , P09601 , P48637 , P35354 , P04637 , CDKN2A , P62937 , O14543 , and P27695 expression profiles revealed distinct stratified subgroups associated with plasma HDLs , P01375 -Î± and postprandial responses of O14543 , and P62937 . Leptin , P05231 , and DNA strand breaks revealed differing responses to fat type consumed . CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates postprandial immune , inflammatory , redox , metabolic , and DNA repair responses that are largely independent of fat type consumed ( unsaturated/saturated ) or addition of beetroot extract , in apparently healthy individuals . However , postprandial responses can be characterized by regulation of gene expression associated with markers linked to health status and are subject to interindividual variation that can influence postprandial responses .
