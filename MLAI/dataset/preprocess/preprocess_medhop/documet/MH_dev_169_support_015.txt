Enhancement of fibrinolysis by gel-filtered platelets and its quenching by cytochalasin B and P08514 /IIIa antagonists . The effects of gel-filtered platelets on euglobulin clot lysis time ( ECLT ) were analyzed to elucidate the possible role of platelets in thrombolysis . Gel-filtered platelet-supplemented ECLT ( plt-ECLT ) was significantly shorter than ECLT without platelets ( regular ECLT ) . DB00054 , anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ( P08514 /IIIa ) antibody , and cytochalasin B nullified the enhancement of ECLT by platelets , and increased plt-ECLT beyond regular ECLT . When gel-filtered platelets were used after disruption , ECLT was not shortened but rather became longer than regular ECLT , probably due to natural fibrinolysis inhibitors released from platelets . Therefore , for platelets to enhance fibrinolysis , intact cell structure and cytoskeletal reorganization after thrombin stimulation is required . Various P08514 /IIIa antagonists prolonged plt-ECLT . The concentrations of P08514 /IIIa antagonists required to prolong plt-ECLT , were varied . Interestingly , the effects of these antagonists were independent of their ability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation , but dependent on their ability to induce clot retraction . T-250 , a P08514 /IIIa antagonist , had the smallest effect on plt-ECLT . These drugs do not affect regular ECLT or tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) -catalyzed DB00142 -plasminogen activation in the presence of thrombin-activated platelets . Although their overall effect on thrombolysis is inhibitory , platelets could promote fibrinolysis through a P08514 /IIIa-dependent mechanism .
