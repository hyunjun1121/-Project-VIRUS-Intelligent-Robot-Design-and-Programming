P13569 mutations impart elevated immune reactivity in a murine model of cystic fibrosis related diabetes . Increased life expectancy in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is accompanied by an increasing incidence of CF related diabetes ( CFRD ) . Altered immune reactivity occurs in CF , which we hypothesize , is exacerbated by hyperglycemia . P13569 deficient ( P13569 -/- ) mice were rendered hyperglycemic by streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) to test this hypothesis . P13569 -/- , C57BL/6J , and FVB/NJ mice received either Q11206 or lactated ringers ( LR ) ( n=5-10 ) . Four weeks later , splenocytes were harvested , mitogen stimulated , and analyzed for cytokine production ( P60568 , P05112 , and P22301 ) along with stimulation indices ( SI ) . SI of Q11206 -treated P13569 -/- were elevated compared to LR-treated mice , although both were greater than C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ ( p < 0.05 ) . Fasting glucose levels of Q11206 -treated P13569 -/- mice correlated with SI ( p < 0.003 ) . Stimulated P22301 concentrations were elevated in Q11206 -treated P13569 -/- compared to LR-treated animals and controls ( p < 0.05 ) . P60568 levels were greater in P13569 -/- mice compared to controls ( p < 0.05 ) , but unrelated to Q11206 . Reinforcing generalized cytokine up-regulation in P13569 -/- , P05112 levels were greater in P13569 -/- mice compared to C57BL/6J , but FVB/NJ mice demonstrated greatest concentrations following Q11206 . These results suggest that , hyperglycemia may exacerbate the clinical course in CF by impacting immune reactivity . There is clear need to maximize metabolic management in CFRD .
