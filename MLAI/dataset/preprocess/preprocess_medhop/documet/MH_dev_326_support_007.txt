The proto-oncogene c-myc blocks myeloid differentiation independently of its target gene ornithine decarboxylase . P11926 ( ODC ) , a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis , has been shown to be required for entry into and progression through the cell cycle and to be a transcriptional target of the proto-oncogene , c-myc . We show that ODC transcripts and enzyme activity are down-regulated following induction of myeloid differentiation , using M1 myeloblastic leukemic cells and normal cells from bone marrow ( BM ) , and fail to be suppressed when c-myc expression is deregulated . In M1mycer cells , when endogenous c-myc expression has been suppressed following stimulation by interleukin-6 ( IL-60 ) , treatment with estrogen and cycloheximide results in induction of ODC transcripts . These data demonstrate that ODC is a c-myc target gene in M1 cells . It was of interest to determine whether deregulated ODC expression would alter the myeloid differentiation program . To answer this question , M1-ODC cell lines constitutively expressing ODC were established . These cells can undergo terminal differentiation and growth arrest following P05231 stimulation , exactly like parental M1 cells , demonstrating that deregulated ODC expression is not sufficient to block myeloid differentiation . Another question to be answered was whether ODC expression is necessary for the c-myc-mediated block in differentiation . The use of alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DB06243 ) , an irreversible inhibitor of ODC enzyme activity , indicates that ODC is not necessary for the c-myc-mediated differentiation block .
