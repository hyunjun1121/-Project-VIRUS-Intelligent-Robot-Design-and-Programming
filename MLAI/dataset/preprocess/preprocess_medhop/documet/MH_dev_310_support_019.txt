MEK and the inhibitors : from bench to bedside . Four distinct Q96HU1 kinase signaling pathways involving 7 MEK enzymes have been identified . Q02750 and P36507 are the prototype members of MEK family proteins . Several MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials . DB08911 is being evaluated by FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with P15056 V600 mutation . Selumetinib has been studied in combination with docetaxel in phase II randomized trial in previously treated patients with advanced lung cancer . Selumetinib group had better response rate and progression-free survival . This review also summarized new MEK inhibitors in clinical development , including pimasertib , refametinib , PD-0325901 , TAK733 , MEK162 ( ARRY 438162 ) , RO5126766 , WX-554 , RO4987655 ( CH4987655 ) , P16260 -0973 ( XL518 ) , and AZD8330 .
