A review of the use of frovatriptan in the treatment of menstrually related migraine . Menstrual migraine ( MM ) is a highly prevalent condition associated with considerable disability . Migraine attacks occur exclusively around the menstrual period in approximately 10 % of women with migraine , that is , pure menstrual migraine , while at least 50 % of them also experience migraine at other times of the month , that is , menstrually related migraine ( MRM ) . The therapeutic approach to patients with MRM is based on treatment of the attack , or prophylactic strategies . Triptans are recommended as first-line treatments for moderate to severe migraine attacks , including MM . DB00998 is one of the newest triptans . Its high affinity for P28222 /1D receptors and long half-life contribute to its distinctive clinical effect , characterized by a more sustained and prolonged effect than other triptans . Indeed , frovatriptan proved to be effective in treating the acute attack , but was particularly effective in the short-term preventive therapy of MM . In addition , frovatriptan is one of the safest triptans , with the lowest risk of treatment-emergent adverse events . Following extensive evidence from randomized pharmacological trials , frovatriptan has now gained a grade A recommendation from the guidelines for short-term prophylaxis of MM . Recent post-hoc analyses of direct comparative trials also suggest that frovatriptan might have an important role in the acute treatment of MRM . In these studies , frovatriptan showed pain relief and pain-free rates similar to those of zolmitriptan , rizatriptan , and almotriptan , but with significantly lower recurrence rates . More well-designed , randomized , prospective studies , specifically enrolling women with MM , will be needed in the near future to confirm the efficacy of frovatriptan in this migraine subtype .
