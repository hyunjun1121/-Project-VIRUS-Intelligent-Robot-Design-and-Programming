Msx2 promotes cardiovascular calcification by activating paracrine Wnt signals . In diabetic P01130 -/- mice , an ectopic P12643 -Msx2 gene regulatory program is upregulated in association with vascular calcification . We verified the procalcific actions of aortic Msx2 expression in vivo . CMV-Msx2 transgenic ( CMV-Msx2Tg(+) ) mice expressed 3-fold higher levels of aortic Msx2 than nontransgenic littermates . On high-fat diets , CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice exhibited marked cardiovascular calcification involving aortic and coronary tunica media . This corresponded to regions of Msx2 immunoreactivity in adjacent adventitial myofibroblasts , suggesting a potential paracrine osteogenic signal . To better understand Msx2-regulated calcification , we studied actions in 10T1/2 cells . We found that conditioned media from Msx2-transduced 10T1/2 cells ( Msx2-CM ) is both pro-osteogenic and adipostatic ; these features are characteristic of Wnt signaling . Msx2-CM stimulated Wnt-dependent TCF/LEF transcription , and Msx2-transduced cells exhibited increased nuclear beta-catenin localization with concomitant alkaline phosphatase induction . Msx2 upregulated Wnt3a and Wnt7a but downregulated expression of the canonical inhibitor Dkk1 . Dkk1 treatment reversed osteogenic and adipostatic actions of Msx2 . DB06285 , a Q03431 agonist that inhibits murine vascular calcification , suppressed vascular P12643 -Msx2-Wnt signaling . Analyses of CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice confirmed that Msx2 suppresses aortic Dkk1 and upregulates vascular Wnts ; moreover , TOPGAL(+) ( Wnt reporter ) ; CMV-Msx2Tg(+) mice exhibited augmented aortic LacZ expression . Thus , Msx2-expressing cells elaborated an osteogenic milieu that promotes vascular calcification in part via paracrine Wnt signals .
