DB00945 antagonizes the cytotoxic effect of methotrexate in lung cancer cells . DB00563 ( MTX ) has been widely used for the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB00945 ( ASA ) is a non-selective cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor that contributes to the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as RA . It has been observed that the antitumor effect of ASA can be attributed to inhibition of cell cycle progression , induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis . In the present study , we revealed that the treatment with a combination of MTX and ASA resulted in antagonism of the cytotoxic effect as demonstrated by P50991 and colony formation assays . ASA alleviated the MTX-mediated S phase accumulation and recovered the P55008 phase . MTX-mediated accumulation of the S phase marker cyclin A was also alleviated by ASA . Notably , FAS protein levels were upregulated by MTX in A549 cells . The antagonism of MTX efficacy caused by ASA was accompanied by altered expression of caspase-3 , Bcl-2 and FAS but not dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . This suggests that the alteration of caspase-3 , Bcl-2 and FAS was involved in the antagonism between ASA and MTX . Exogenously added folic acid reversed the MTX-mediated P00374 inhibition following either MTX or MTX + ASA treatments . Most importantly , we demonstrated for the first time that the commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for headache ASA and possibly other P23219 /2 inhibitors can produce a strong antagonistic effect on the growth inhibition of lung cancer cells when administered in combination with MTX . The clinical implication of our finding is obvious , i.e. , the clinical efficacy of MTX therapy can be compromised by ASA and their concomitant use should be avoided .
