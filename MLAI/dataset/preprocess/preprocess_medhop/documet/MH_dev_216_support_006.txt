The Lyme disease vaccine takes its toll . Vaccination with Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein ( Osp ) A can induce a protective response against Lyme disease and serves as a model to understand the generation of protective immune responses against the spirochete . The innate response to pathogens is activated by specific Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) that recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns . O60603 is of particular interest for B. burgdorferi research because O60603 recognizes several pathogen-associated molecular patterns , including lipoproteins . O60603 may form heterodimers with Q9Y2C9 to identify diacylated lipoproteins , while O60603 works in concert with Q15399 to recognize triacylated lipoproteins such as OspA . We will discuss the role of Q15399 /2 in the development of responses to OspA in Q15399 -and O60603 -deficient mice , and in selected individuals that received the OspA vaccine . While > 95 % of human OspA-based Lyme disease vaccine recipients develop OspA antibodies , a very small group of individuals did not develop detectable humoral responses against OspA . We demonstrated that this hyporesponsiveness to OspA vaccination was associated with decreased cell surface expression of Q15399 . Moreover , Q15399 - and O60603 -deficient mice did not develop significant levels of OspA antibodies following vaccination with OspA , providing a correlation with human hyporesponsiveness to OspA . These data suggest that defects in the Q15399 /2 signaling pathway are associated with an impaired ability to generate antibodies following immunization with DB00045 .
