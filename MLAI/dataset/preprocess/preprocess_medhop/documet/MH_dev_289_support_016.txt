Nuclear factor-kappaB enhances ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and neoangiogenesis in vivo . The ( P04626 /Neu ) ErbB2 oncogene is commonly overexpressed in human breast cancer and is sufficient for mammary tumorigenesis in transgenic mice . Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB activity is increased in both human and murine breast tumors . The immune response to mammary tumorigenesis may regulate tumor progression . The role of endogenous mammary epithelial cell NF-kappaB had not previously been determined in immune-competent animals . Furthermore , the role of the NF-kappaB components , p50 and p65 , in tumor growth was not known . Herein , the expression of a stabilized form of the NF-kappaB-inhibiting P25963 protein ( IkappaBalphaSR ) in breast tumor cell lines that express oncogenic ErbB2 inhibited DNA synthesis and growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures . Either NF-kappaB inhibition or selective silencing of p50 or p65 led to a loss of contact-independent tumor growth in vitro . IkappaBalphaSR reversed the features of the oncogene-induced phenotype under three-dimensional growth conditions . The NF-kappaB blockade inhibited ErbB2-induced mammary tumor growth in both immune-competent and immune-deficient mice . These findings were associated with both reduced tumor microvascular density and a reduction in the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor . The expression of IkappaBalphaSR in breast cancer tumors inhibited angiogenesis . Thus , mammary epithelial cell NF-kappaB activity enhances ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in vivo by promoting both growth and survival signaling via the promotion of tumor vasculogenesis .
