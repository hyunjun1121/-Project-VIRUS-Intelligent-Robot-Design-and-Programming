DB01404 saponin metabolite induces apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells through the modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase . Previous studies have shown that the ginseng saponin metabolite , Compound K ( 20-O-d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol , IH901 ) , suppresses proliferation of various cancers and induces apoptosis . AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is a sensor of cellular energy states and is involved in apoptosis of cancer cells . We hypothesized that Compound K may exert cytotoxicity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through modulation of AMPK , followed by a decrease in cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression . Compound K inhibited cell growth , induced apoptosis via generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as well as decreasing P35354 expression and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) levels . These effects of Compound K were induced via an AMPK-dependent pathway and were abrogated by a specific AMPK inhibitor . These results suggest that Compound K induced apoptosis by modulating AMPK- P35354 signaling in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells .
