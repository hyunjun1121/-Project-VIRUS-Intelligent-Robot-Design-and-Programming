Comparison of variations detection between whole-genome amplification methods used in single-cell resequencing . BACKGROUND : Single-cell resequencing ( SCRS ) provides many biomedical advances in variations detection at the single-cell level , but it currently relies on whole genome amplification ( WGA ) . Three methods are commonly used for WGA : multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) , degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR ( DOP-PCR ) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles ( MALBAC ) . However , a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance between these WGA methods has not yet been performed . RESULTS : We systematically compared the advantages and disadvantages of different WGA methods , focusing particularly on variations detection . Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing revealed that DOP-PCR had the highest duplication ratio , but an even read distribution and the best reproducibility and accuracy for detection of copy-number variations ( CNVs ) . However , MDA had significantly higher genome recovery sensitivity ( ~84 % ) than DOP-PCR ( ~6 % ) and MALBAC ( ~52 % ) at high sequencing depth . MALBAC and MDA had comparable single-nucleotide variations detection efficiency , false-positive ratio , and allele drop-out ratio . We further demonstrated that SCRS data amplified by either MDA or MALBAC from a gastric cancer cell line could accurately detect gastric cancer CNVs with comparable sensitivity and specificity , including amplifications of 12p11.22 ( P01116 ) and 9p24.1 ( O60674 , Q9NZQ7 , and Q9BQ51 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance using SCRS amplified by different WGA methods . It will guide researchers to determine which WGA method is best suited to individual experimental needs at single-cell level .
