A single-domain llama antibody potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of botulinum neurotoxin by binding to the non-catalytic alpha-exosite binding region . Ingestion or inhalation of botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) results in botulism , a severe and frequently fatal disease . Current treatments rely on antitoxins , which , while effective , can not reverse symptoms once BoNT has entered the neuron . For treatments that can reverse intoxication , interest has focused on developing inhibitors of the enzymatic BoNT light chain ( BoNT Lc ) . Such inhibitors typically mimic substrate and bind in or around the substrate cleavage pocket . To explore the full range of binding sites for serotype A light chain ( DB00083 Lc ) inhibitors , we created a library of non-immune llama single-domain VHH ( camelid heavy-chain variable region derived from heavy-chain-only antibody ) antibodies displayed on the surface of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Library selection on DB00083 Lc yielded 15 yeast-displayed VHH with equilibrium dissociation constants ( K(d) ) from 230 to 0.03 nM measured by flow cytometry . Eight of 15 VHH inhibited the cleavage of substrate P60880 ( synaptosome-associated protein of 25,000 Da ) by DB00083 Lc . The most potent VHH ( Aa1 ) had a solution K(d) for DB00083 Lc of 1.47 x 10(-)(10) M and an IC(50) ( 50 % inhibitory concentration ) of 4.7 x 10(-)(10) M and was resistant to heat denaturation and reducing conditions . To understand the mechanism by which Aa1 inhibited catalysis , we solved the X-ray crystal structure of the DB00083 Lc-Aa1 VHH complex at 2.6 A resolution . The structure reveals that the Aa1 VHH binds in the alpha-exosite of the DB00083 Lc , far from the active site for catalysis . The study validates the utility of non-immune llama VHH libraries as a source of enzyme inhibitors and identifies the DB00083 Lc alpha-exosite as a target for inhibitor development .
