Altered decorin leads to disrupted endothelial cell function : a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of fetal growth restriction ? OBJECTIVE : Fetal growth restriction ( P09769 ) is a key cause of adverse pregnancy outcome where maternal and fetal factors are identified as contributing to this condition . Idiopathic P09769 is associated with altered vascular endothelial cell functions . P07585 ( P07585 ) has important roles in the regulation of endothelial cell functions in vascular environments . P07585 expression is reduced in P09769 . The objectives were to determine the functional consequences of reduced P07585 in a human microvascular endothelial cell line model ( HMVEC ) , and to determine downstream targets of P07585 and their expression in primary placental microvascular endothelial cells ( PLECs ) from control and P09769 -affected placentae . APPROACH : Short-interference RNA was used to reduce P07585 expression in HMVECs and the effect on proliferation , angiogenesis and thrombin generation was determined . A Growth Factor PCR Array was used to identify downstream targets of P07585 . The expression of target genes in control and P09769 PLECs was performed . RESULTS : P07585 reduction decreased proliferation and angiogenesis but increased thrombin generation with no effect on apoptosis . The array identified three targets of P07585 : O60258 , Q14116 and O14793 . Validation of target genes confirmed decreased expression of P15692 , P14780 , EGFR1 , P12314 and P49763 in HMVECs and PLECs from control and P09769 pregnancies . CONCLUSIONS : Reduction of P07585 in vascular endothelial cells leads to disrupted cell functions . The targets of P07585 include genes that play important roles in angiogenesis and cellular growth . Therefore , differential expression of these may contribute to the pathogenesis of P09769 and disease states in other microvascular circulations .
