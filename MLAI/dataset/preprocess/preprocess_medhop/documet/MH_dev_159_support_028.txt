Guggulsterone inhibits angiogenesis by blocking P40763 and P15692 expression in colon cancer cells . The plant sterol guggulsterone has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects , making it a candidate chemotherapeutic agent . We investigated the anti-tumor effects of guggulsterone on colon cancer cells and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms related to angiogenesis . The apoptotic effects of guggulsterone were examined by cell survival assay . Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of various down-stream intracellular proteins involved in angiogenesis , including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator ( P27540 ) . Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay , we tested whether guggulsterone affects the recruitment of P40763 , P27540 and HIF-1alpha to the human P15692 promoter . To investigate the effect of guggulsterone on vascular endothelial cell migration and invasion , tube formation and migration assays were conducted using human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 and -9 activities were measured by gelatin zymography . Guggulsterone significantly reduced cell viability in colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and blocked P15692 , P27540 and P40763 expression prominently in hypoxic conditions . The recruitment of P40763 and P27540 , but not HIF-1alpha , to the P15692 promoter was inhibited by guggulsterone treatment . HUVECs produced much foreshortened and severely broken tubes and showed decreased migration activity under guggulsterone effects . In addition , zymography revealed that P08253 and -9 enzyme activities were markedly lower in the presence of guggulsterone . The results of this study suggest that guggulsterone not only induces apoptosis , but also inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis in colon cancer cells by blocking P40763 and P15692 expression , suggesting its therapeutic potential in the treatment of colorectal cancer .
