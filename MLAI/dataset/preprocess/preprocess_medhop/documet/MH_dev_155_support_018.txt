P05231 , P01579 and P01375 production by liver-associated T cells and acute liver injury in rats administered concanavalin A . The relationship between the development of acute hepatitis and the production of P01375 P01579 and P05231 by liver-associated T lymphocytes following intravenous injection of concanavalin A ( Con A ) was studied in rats . Following a single injection of Con A , there was a dose and time-dependent correlation in the serum levels of serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , P05231 , P01579 and P01375 . These increases correlated with an increase in the numbers of P01730 + , CD8+ and CD25+ T cells in blood and P01730 + and CD25+ T cells in the liver perfusate , but not with CD8+ T cells in liver perfusate . Increased levels of P05231 , P01579 and P01375 were constitutively produced by liver-associated P01730 + T cells when cultured . In Con A-stimulated cultures , liver-associated P01730 + T cells secreted increasing levels of P01375 in a time-dependent manner following Con A injection , but P01375 production by peripheral blood lymphocytes was transient with peak levels detected at 1 h which then declined over 24 h . Histological examination of the liver revealed fatty change , hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis , with an associated cell infiltrate of neutrophils and P01730 + T cells both in the portal areas and around the central veins . These results support the hypothesis that Con A-induced liver damage is mediated by P01730 + T cells acting within the liver , at least in part through the secretion of P01375 , P01579 and P05231 .
