P01286 as an agonist of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . Ghrelin synergizes with growth hormone-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) to potentiate growth hormone ( GH ) response through a mechanism not yet fully characterized . This study was conducted to analyze the role of P01286 as a potential ligand of the ghrelin receptor , GHS-R1a . The results show that hGHRH(1-29)NH(2) ( P01286 ) induces a dose-dependent calcium mobilization in P29320 293 cells stably transfected with GHS-R1a an effect not observed in wild-type P29320 293 cells . This calcium rise is also observed using the Q02643 agonists JI-34 and JI-36 . Radioligand binding and cross-linking studies revealed that calcium response to P01286 is mediated by the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . P01286 activates the signaling route of inositol phosphate and potentiates the maximal response to ghrelin measured in inositol phosphate turnover . The presence of P01286 increases the binding capacity of (125)I-ghrelin in a dose dependent-fashion showing a positive binding cooperativity . In addition , confocal microscopy in CHO cells transfected with GHS-R1a tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein shows that P01286 activates the GHS-R1a endocytosis . Furthermore , the selective P01286 -R antagonists , JV-1-42 and JMR-132 , act also as antagonists of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a . Our findings suggest that P01286 interacts with ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a , and , in consequence , modifies the ghrelin-associated intracellular signaling pathway . This interaction may represent a form of regulation , which could play a putative role in the physiology of GH regulation and appetite control .
