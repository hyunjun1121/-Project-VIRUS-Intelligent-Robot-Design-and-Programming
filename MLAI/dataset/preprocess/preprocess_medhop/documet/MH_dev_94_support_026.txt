Interferon-gamma-induced dephosphorylation of P40763 and apoptosis are dependent on the P42345 pathway . Interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) exhibits diverse biological activities , including control of cell growth and tumor suppression . Here , we report that the treatment of M12 cells , a human metastatic prostate cancer cell line , with P01579 , resulted in marked inhibition of cell proliferation and induced apoptosis . These effects were not seen with either IFN-alpha or IFN-beta . M12 cells , like many other human cancer cells , contain constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) . The basal levels of both Akt and P27361 /2 phosphorylation are also markedly elevated in M12 cells . Strikingly , P01579 -induced apoptosis and growth inhibition of M12 cells were associated with persistent suppression of the constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylated P40763 ( pY- P40763 ) . The P01579 -induced dephosphorylation of pY- P40763 , however , was inhibited when the P42345 pathway was specifically blocked by rapamycin . Inhibition of PI-3K with low-dose LY294002 , or MAPK with PD98059 also suppressed the P42345 / P08133 S6k pathway , and correlated with the blockage of P01579 -induced dephosphorylation of pY- P40763 . Simultaneously , treatment with LY294002 , PD98059 , or rapamycin abolished P01579 -induced apoptosis in M12 cells . The inhibition of the P42345 pathway , however , did not affect P01579 -induced activation of P42224 pathway , and suppression of P42224 expression by siRNA had no effect on P01579 -induced dephosphorylation of pY- P40763 . Taken together , these results demonstrate that an intact P42345 pathway is critical for P01579 -induced suppression of pY- P40763 and apoptosis . Our study thus provides novel insights into the contributions of signaling pathways other than the classical JAK/ P42224 pathway in the anti-proliferative , proapoptotic actions of P01579 .
