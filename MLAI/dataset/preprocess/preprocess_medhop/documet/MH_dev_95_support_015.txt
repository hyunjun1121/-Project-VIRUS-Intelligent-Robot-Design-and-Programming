p300 mediates functional synergism between P38484 and AF-2 of estrogen receptor alpha and beta by interacting directly with the N-terminal A/B domains . P03372 ( ER ) alpha and beta mediate estrogen actions in target cells through transcriptional control of target gene expression . For 17beta-estradiol-induced transactivation , the N-terminal A/B domain ( P38484 ) and the C-terminal E/F domain ( AF-2 ) of ERs are required . Ligand binding is considered to induce functional synergism between P38484 and AF-2 , but the molecular mechanism remains unknown . To clarify this synergism , we studied the role of reported AF-2 coactivators , p300/CREB binding protein , steroid receptor coactivator-1/transcriptional intermediary factor-2 ( Q15788 / Q15596 ) family proteins and thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein-220/ ( vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein- 205-( Q15648 / Q15648 ) on the P38484 activity in terms of synergism with the AF-2 function . We found that neither any of the Q15788 / Q15596 family coactivators nor Q15648 / Q15648 is potent , whereas p300 potentiates the P38484 function of both human ERalpha and human ERbeta . Direct interactions of p300 with the A/B domains of ERalpha and ERbeta were observed in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay in accordance with the interactions in yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays . Furthermore , mutations in the p300 binding sites ( 56-72 amino acids in ERalpha and 62-72 amino acids in ERbeta ) in the A/B domains caused a reduction in ligand-induced transactivation functions of both ERalpha and ERbeta . Thus , these findings indicate that ligand-induced functional synergism between P38484 and AF-2 is mediated through p300 by its direct binding to the A/B regions of ERalpha and ERbeta .
