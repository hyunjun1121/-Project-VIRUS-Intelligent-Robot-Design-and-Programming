The design and development of pegfilgrastim ( PEG-rmetHuG- P04141 , Neulasta ) . Recombinant protein technology produces drugs for human therapy in unprecedented quantity and quality . Research is now focusing on the relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of molecules , with the aim of engineering proteins that possess enhanced therapeutic characteristics in contrast to being used as simple replacements for the natural equivalent . The addition of a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) moiety to filgrastim ( rmetHu- DB00099 , Neupogen ) resulted in the development of pegfilgrastim . DB00019 is a long-acting form of filgrastim that requires only once-per-cycle administration for the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia . The covalent attachment of PEG to the N-terminal amine group of the parent molecule was attained using site-directed reductive alkylation . Pegylation increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for renal clearance . Consequently , neutrophil-mediated clearance predominates in elimination of the drug . This extends the median serum half-life of pegfilgrastim to 42 hours , compared with between 3.5 and 3.8 hours for DB00099 , though in fact the half-life is variable , depending on the absolute neutrophil count , which in turn reflects of the ability of pegfilgrastim to sustain production of those same cells . The clearance of the molecule is thus dominated by a self-regulating mechanism . DB00019 retains the same biological activity as filgrastim , and binds to the same Q99062 , stimulating the proliferation , differentiation and activation of neutrophils . Once-per-chemotherapy cycle administration of pegfilgrastim reduces the duration of severe neutropenia as effectively as daily treatment with filgrastim . In clinical trials , patients receiving pegfilgrastim also had a lower observed incidence of febrile neutropenia than patients receiving filgrastim .
