DB01012 Treatment in an Adolescent With Concurrent 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome and Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia Type 3 Caused by P53680 Mutation . CONTEXT : The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome ( DS ) is a common multiple anomaly syndrome in which typical features include congenital heart defects , facial dysmorphism , and palatal anomalies . Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism is a common endocrine manifestation resulting from variable parathyroid hypoplasia , but hypercalcemia has not previously been reported in 22q11.2 DS . CASE DESCRIPTION : Our patient is a 16-year-old adolescent male with dysmorphic facial features and delayed motor and speech development . At 2 years of age , 22q11.2 DS was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization . In contrast to hypoparathyroidism that is usually seen in 22q11.2 DS , this patient had early childhood-onset hypercalcemia with inappropriately high PTH levels and hypocalciuria . Genomic DNA was obtained from the proband and screened for calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) mutations with negative results . No parathyroid tissue could be localized by imaging or surgical exploration . As a result of symptomatic hypercalcemia , the patient was treated with a calcimimetic ( cinacalcet ) . During the treatment , plasma calcium normalized with mild symptoms of hypocalcemia . After discontinuation of cinacalcet , calcium returned to high pretreatment levels . Further DNA analysis of adaptor protein-2 Ïƒ subunit ( P53680 ) showed a heterozygous missense mutation c.44 G > T , resulting in a p.R15L substitution ; the mutation was absent in the healthy parents and two siblings . CONCLUSIONS : Hypercalcemia in our patient with 22q11.2 DS could be explained by the de novo mutation in P53680 . Identification of a genetic cause for hypercalcemia is helpful in guiding management and avoiding unnecessary treatment .
