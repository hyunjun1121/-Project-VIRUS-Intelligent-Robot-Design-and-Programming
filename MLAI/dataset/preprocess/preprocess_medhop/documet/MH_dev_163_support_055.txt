Generation of colonies of induced trophoblast cells during standard reprogramming of porcine fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells . During reprogramming of porcine mesenchymal cells with a four-factor ( Q01860 / P48431 / O43474 /MYC ) mixture of vectors , a fraction of the colonies had an atypical phenotype and arose earlier than the recognizable porcine induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell colonies . Within days after each passage , patches of cells with an epithelial phenotype formed raised domes , particularly under 20 % O(2) conditions . Relative to gene expression of the iPS cells , there was up-regulation of genes for transcription factors associated with trophoblast ( TR ) lineage emergence , e.g. , P23769 , P37231 , P35548 , O60479 , O96004 , Q9NP62 , Q99626 , Q02363 , Q9UKW6 , TCFAP2C , and Q15561 and for genes required for synthesis of products more typical of differentiated TR , such as steroids ( P14061 , P05108 , and STAR ) , pregnancy-associated glycoproteins ( PAG6 ) , and select cytokines ( IFND , P01579 , and P01584 ) . Although Q01860 was down-regulated relative to that in iPS cells , it was not silenced in the induced TR ( iTR ) cells over continued passage . Like iPS cells , iTR cells did not senesce on extended passage and displayed high telomerase activity . Upon xenografting into immunodeficient mice , iTR cells formed nonhemorrhagic teratomas composed largely of layers of epithelium expressing TR markers . When cultured under conditions that promoted embryoid body formation , iTR cells formed floating spheres consisting of a single epithelial sheet whose cells were tethered laterally by desmosome-like structures . In conclusion , reprogramming of porcine fibroblasts to iPS cells generates , as a by-product , colonies composed of self-renewing populations of TR cells , possibly containing TR stem cells .
