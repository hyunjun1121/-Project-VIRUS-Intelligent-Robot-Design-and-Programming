Concentration-dependent effect of abciximab on platelets and neutrophils in a model of cardiopulmonary bypass . DB00054 is a P08514 /IIIa antagonist used in percutaneous coronary interventions to avoid platelet activation , thrombosis and inflammation . We investigated whether abciximab influenced platelet activation and platelet interaction with neutrophils and polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) in a cardiopulmonary bypass ( P15086 ) model . Isolated platelets , preincubated with and without 0.1-20 microg/mL of abciximab , were resuspended with neutrophils in plasma and recirculated by a roller pump . Platelet , but not neutrophil adhesion to PVC was inhibited by abciximab . Only high doses of abciximab reduced platelet aggregation size , but simultaneously increased platelet-neutrophil aggregation . DB00054 had no effect on platelet CD62P expression or degranulation , but platelet activation on platelet-neutrophil aggregates increased with high doses . Only low doses inhibited neutrophil degranulation . The concentration-dependent effect of abciximab on platelet-neutrophil interaction reduces its usefulness and stresses the dependency on experimental design in the evaluation of abciximab . Our study does not support the use of abciximab alone in P15086 . However , incorporation of surface-coating the biomaterial with abciximab may be an interesting option .
