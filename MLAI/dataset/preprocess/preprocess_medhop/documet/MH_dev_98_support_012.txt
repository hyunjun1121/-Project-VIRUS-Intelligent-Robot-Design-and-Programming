Activation of hepatocyte growth factor receptor , c-met , in renal tubules is required for renoprotection after acute kidney injury . P14210 is a pleiotrophic protein that promotes injury repair and regeneration in multiple organs . Here , we show that after acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , the P08581 , c-met , was induced predominantly in renal tubular epithelium . To investigate the role of tubule-specific induction of c-met in AKI , we generated conditional knockout mice , in which the c-met gene was specifically disrupted in renal tubules . These Ksp-met-/- mice were phenotypically normal and had no appreciable defect in kidney morphology and function . However , in AKI induced by cisplatin or ischemia/reperfusion injury , the loss of tubular c-met substantially aggravated renal injury . Compared with controls , Ksp-met-/- mice displayed higher serum creatinine , more severe morphologic lesions , and increased apoptosis , which was accompanied by an increased expression of Bax and P48023 and decreased phosphorylation/activation of Akt . In addition , ablation of c-met in renal tubules promoted chemokine expression and renal inflammation after AKI . Consistently , ectopic expression of hepatocyte growth factor in vivo protected the kidneys against AKI in control mice , but not in Ksp-met-/- counterparts . Thus , our results suggest that tubule-specific c-met signaling is crucial in conferring renal protection after AKI , primarily by its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms .
