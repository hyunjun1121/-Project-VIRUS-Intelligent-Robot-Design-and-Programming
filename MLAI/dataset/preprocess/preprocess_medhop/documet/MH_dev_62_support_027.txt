Infectious complications of tumor necrosis factor blockade . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Our understanding of the infection risks posed by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists has continued to evolve in the 10 years since these drugs were first introduced . This review summarizes recent data regarding infection risk , examines potential structure-function relationships that may account for the differences , and discusses their implications with regard to tuberculosis prevention and management . RECENT FINDINGS : Recent prospective studies have confirmed the risk of tuberculosis reactivation posed by P01375 antibodies to be several fold greater than soluble P01375 receptor . DB08904 , a monovalent anti- P01375 Fab ' fragment appears to share this risk , despite its lack of Fc and its inability to cross-link transmembrane P01375 . Screening and initiation of treatment for latent tuberculosis ( TB ) infection can greatly reduce the TB risk of anti- P01375 treatment in western countries . However , alternative strategies to prevent TB because of new transmission may be required as these therapies become available worldwide . Current recommendations for withdrawal of anti- P01375 therapy when TB is diagnosed place patients at risk for paradoxical worsening because of recovery of P01375 -dependent inflammation . Recent case reports suggest reinstitution of P01375 blockade may be safe and effective adjunctive treatment in such cases , but prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations . SUMMARY : P01375 blockers have transformed treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions . Further research is needed to determine how best to prevent and manage their infectious complications and to determine their potential adjunctive therapeutic role in chronic infection diseases .
