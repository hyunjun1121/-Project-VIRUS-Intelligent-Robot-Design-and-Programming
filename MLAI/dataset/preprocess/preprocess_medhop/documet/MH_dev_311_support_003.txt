Intraretinal lipid transport is dependent on high density lipoprotein-like particles and class B scavenger receptors . PURPOSE : In our companion paper we demonstrated that circulating lipoproteins enter the retina via the retinal pigment epithelium ( Q96AT9 ) and possibly MÃ¼ller cells . In order to understand how these lipids are transported within the retina , expression and localization of the main proteins known to be involved in systemic lipid transport was determined . METHODS : Expression of O95477 , apoA1 ( the major HDL protein ) , Q8WTV0 , SR- Q15878 , P16671 , lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase ( P04180 ) , and cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunoblots . Localization was determined by immunohistochemistry using fresh monkey vibrotome sections and imaged by confocal microscopy . RESULTS : O95477 and apoA1 were localized to the ganglion cell layer , retinal pigment epithelium ( Q96AT9 ) , and rod photoreceptor inner segments . ApoA1 was also observed associated with rod photoreceptor outer segments , presumably localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix ( IPM ) . The scavenger receptors Q8WTV0 and SR- Q15878 localized mainly to the ganglion cell layer and photoreceptor outer segments ; in the latter they appear to be associated with microtubules . P04180 and P11597 localized mainly to the IPM . CONCLUSIONS : The presence and specific localization of these well-known lipid transport proteins suggest that the retina employs an internal lipid transport mechanism that involves processing and maturation of HDL-like particles .
