DB04892 . DB04892 , a derivative of physostigmine , was first described as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and was shown to improve cognition in various experimental paradigms in rodents and dogs . It was clinically tested for Alzheimer 's disease , with moderate success in initial Phase II studies . DB04892 deserves attention for an additional quality of action : in addition to inhibiting P22303 , it modulates the amount of beta-amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) in neuronal cell culture by reducing P05067 translation . This effect probably involves interaction of phenserine with a regulatory element in the 5'-untranslated region of the P05067 gene that controls P05067 expression . DB04892 apparently reduces translational efficiency of P05067 mRNA into protein , a process that may involve an interaction with iron and/or an iron-responsive element . As a consequence , phenserine reduces beta-amyloid peptide ( Abeta ) formation in vitro and in vivo . DB04892 is also unique because of differing actions of its enantiomers : DB04892 is the active enantiomer for inhibition of P22303 , whereas (+)-phenserine ( ' posiphen ' ) has weak activity as an P22303 inhibitor and can be dosed much higher . Both enantiomers are equipotent in downregulating P05067 expression . (+)-Posiphen may be a promising drug , either alone or in combination with DB04892 , to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer 's disease .
