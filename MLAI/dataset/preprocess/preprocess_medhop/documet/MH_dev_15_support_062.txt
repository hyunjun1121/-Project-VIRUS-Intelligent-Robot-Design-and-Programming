DB08875 : a review of its use in patients with medullary thyroid cancer . DB08875 ( Cometriq(Â®) ) is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors , including those involved in the pathogenesis of medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) [ i.e. rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) , MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -2 ] . DB08875 is indicated for the treatment of adults with progressive , unresectable locally advanced ( in the EU ) or metastatic ( in the EU and USA ) P04629 . Compared with placebo , cabozantinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival , reflecting a 72 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death , in patients with unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic P04629 participating in a multinational , phase III study . A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving cabozantinib than those receiving placebo achieved an objective response or disease stabilization ( i.e. a complete or partial response , or stable disease ) . The overall survival benefit with cabozantinib is as yet unclear , with no significant benefit observed in two interim analyses ( one prespecified , and one unplanned and conducted at the request of the US FDA ) . The tolerability profile of oral cabozantinib is typical for a small molecule targeting the VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways , with adverse events associated with the inhibition of the P15692 pathway ( e.g. gastrointestinal perforation , haemorrhage , hypertension and venous thrombosis ) reported in the phase III study . Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally managed with supportive therapy , dose reductions and/or dose interruptions . Although final overall survival data are awaited , current evidence suggests cabozantinib to be a valuable treatment option for adults with progressive , unresectable locally advanced or metastatic P04629 .
