Development of pH-responsive fluorescent false neurotransmitters . We introduce pH-responsive fluorescent false neurotransmitters ( pH-responsive FFNs ) as novel probes that act as vesicular monoamine transporter ( VMAT ) substrates and ratiometric fluorescent pH sensors . The development of these agents was achieved by systematic molecular design that integrated several structural elements , including the aminoethyl group ( VMAT recognition ) , halogenated hydroxy-coumarin core ( ratiometric optical pH sensing in the desired pH range ) , and N- or C-alkylation ( modulation of lipophilicity ) . Of 14 compounds that were synthesized , the probe Mini202 was selected based on the highest uptake in Q05940 -transfected P29320 cells and desirable optical properties . Using Mini202 , we measured the pH of catecholamine secretory vesicles in PC-12 cells ( pH approximately 5.9 ) via two-photon fluorescence microscopy . Incubation with methamphetamine led to an increase in vesicular pH ( pH approximately 6.4 ) , consistent with a proposed mechanism of action of this psychostimulant , and eventually to redistribution of vesicular content ( including Mini202 ) from vesicles to cytoplasm . Mini202 is sufficiently bright , photostable , and suitable for two-photon microscopy . This probe will enable fundamental neuroscience and neuroendocrine research as well as drug screening efforts .
