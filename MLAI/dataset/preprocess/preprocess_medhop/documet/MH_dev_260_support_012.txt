Protein kinase C-associated kinase regulates NF-κB activation through inducing IKK activation . Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB induced by extracellular stimuli requires IKKα and IKKβ kinase activity . How IKKα and IKKβ are activated by various upstream signaling molecules is not fully understood . We previously showed that protein kinase C-associated kinase ( P03952 , also known as P57078 /RIP4 ) , which belongs to the receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) kinase family , mediates the B cell activating factor of the P01375 family ( Q9Y275 ) -induced NF-κB activation in diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) cell lines . Here we have investigated the mechanism underlying NF-κB activation regulated by P03952 . Our results suggest that P03952 can activate both the classical and the alternative NF-κB activation pathways . P03952 associates with IKKα and IKKβ in mammalian cells and induces activation of both IKKα and IKKβ via phosphorylation of their serine residues 176/180 and 177/181 , respectively . Unlike other members of the RIP family that activate NF-κB through a kinase-independent pathway , P03952 appears to activate IKK and NF-κB mainly in a kinase-dependent manner . Suppression of P03952 expression by RNA interference inhibits phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ as well as activation of NF-κB in human cancer cell lines . Thus , P03952 regulates NF-κB activation by modulating activation of IKKα and IKKβ in mammalian cells . We propose that P03952 may provide a critical link between IKK activation and various upstream signaling cascades , and may represent a potential target for inhibiting abnormal NF-κB activation in human cancers .
