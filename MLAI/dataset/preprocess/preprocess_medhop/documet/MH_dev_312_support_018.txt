DB00674 ameliorates the impairment of recognition memory in mice repeatedly treated with methamphetamine : involvement of allosteric potentiation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and dopaminergic- P27361 /2 systems . DB00674 , a drug used to treat Alzheimer 's disease , inhibits acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and allosterically modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) resulting in stimulation of catecholamine neurotransmission . In this study , we investigated whether galantamine exerts cognitive-improving effects through the allosteric modulation of nAChRs in an animal model of methamphetamine ( Meth ) psychosis . The mice treated with Meth ( 1 mg/kg.d ) for 7 d showed memory impairment in a novel object recognition test . DB00674 ( 3 mg/kg ) ameliorated the memory impairment , and it increased the extracellular dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) of Meth-treated mice . Donepezil , an P22303 inhibitor ( 1 mg/kg ) increased the extracellular ACh release in the P27918 , whereas it had no effect on the memory impairment in Meth-treated mice . The nAChR antagonist , mecamylamine , and dopamine D1 receptor antagonist , P35240 23390 , blocked the ameliorating effect of galantamine on Meth-induced memory impairment , whereas the muscarinic AChR antagonist , scopolamine , had no effect . The effects of galantamine on extracellular dopamine release were also antagonized by mecamylamine . DB00674 attenuated the defect of the novelty-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . The ameliorating effect of galantamine on recognition memory in Meth-treated mice was negated by microinjection of an P29323 inhibitor , PD98059 , into the P27918 . These results suggest that the ameliorating effect of galantamine on Meth-induced memory impairment is associated with indirect activation of dopamine D1 receptor- P27361 /2 following augmentation with dopaminergic neurotransmission in the P27918 through the allosteric activation of nAChRs . DB00674 could be a useful therapeutic agent for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia/Meth psychosis , as well as Alzheimer 's disease .
