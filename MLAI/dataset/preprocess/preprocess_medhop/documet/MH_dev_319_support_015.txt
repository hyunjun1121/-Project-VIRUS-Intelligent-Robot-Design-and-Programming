DB09053 inhibits P11274 and NF-κB signaling and reduces tumor proliferation in tissue-resident cells of patients with CLL . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells depend on microenvironmental factors for proliferation and survival . In particular , tissue-resident CLL cells show prominent activation of both B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) and NF-κB pathways . We evaluated the in vivo effects of ibrutinib , a Q06187 ( Q06187 ) inhibitor on tumor cell activation and proliferation in the blood , lymph node , and bone marrow of patients with CLL . Applying validated pathway-specific gene signatures , we detected a rapid and sustained downregulation of P11274 and NF-κB signaling in CLL cells from both the peripheral blood and tissue compartments during ibrutinib treatment . DB09053 reduced phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and P29323 and decreased nuclear protein expression of NF-κB p50 . DB09053 significantly decreased tumor proliferation and expression of surface activation markers Q07108 and P42081 , independent of prognostic factors such as IGHV mutational status , chromosome 17p deletion , or prior treatment history . Interestingly , stronger inhibition of P11274 signaling in lymph node resident CLL cells after one dose of ibrutinib was associated with a higher rate of nodal response at the end of cycle 2 . Together , these data validate on-target effects of Q06187 inhibition in the tissue compartments and demonstrate that ibrutinib effectively inhibits pathways that promote tumor cell activation and proliferation in vivo .
