P29965 proinflammatory and profibrotic effects on proximal tubular epithelial cells : role of NF-kappaB and lyn . Chronic allograft nephropathy ( P35658 ) is the main cause of renal graft loss , but its pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear . Immune system activation has been suggested as a key event in the development of P35658 . P25942 is a co-stimulatory protein whose expression is upregulated in proximal tubular epithelial cells ( PTEC ) in acute rejection . This receptor interacts with P29965 , expressed by activated T cells . P29965 induces the production by PTEC of different proinflammatory cytokines , but very little is known of its profibrotic effects . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of P25942 / P29965 interaction on PTEC expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , a powerful profibrotic mediator , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) , a proinflammatory cytokine , and to investigate the signaling pathways that lead to these effects . Soluble P29965 induced a time-dependent increase in both P05121 and P13500 gene expression and protein production in PTEC . P25942 cross-linking on PTEC caused P01375 -R-associated factors 2 and 6 membrane translocation . This event led to NF-kappaB activation , through the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , and to a significant increase in the phosphorylation of lyn , a src-related tyrosine kinase . Lyn , upon phosphorylation , became strictly associated with caveolin-1 , a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae . Lyn inhibition did not have any effect on P29965 -induced NF-kappaB activation and P13500 expression but abolished P05121 induction . On the contrary , NF-kappaB inhibition significantly reduced only P13500 expression . In conclusion , P29965 could play a key role in the pathogenesis of P35658 through P05121 induction . P29965 profibrotic and proinflammatory effects are mediated by different signaling pathways , suggesting that drugs that inhibit inflammation may not be equally effective in reducing fibrosis .
