P10275 expression in breast cancer patients tested for P38398 and P51587 mutations . AIM : To assess the expression of receptors for androgen ( AR ) , oestrogen ( ER ) and progesterone ( PR ) as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( Her-2/neu ) status of breast carcinomas in breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) P38398 /2 mutation carriers and P38398 /2 negative tested women . METHODS : One hundred and thirty-five breast cancers in women tested for P38398 /2 mutations . Screening for P38398 and P51587 mutations was performed by direct sequencing of all P38398 and P51587 exons as well as the surrounding intronic sequences . Additionally , BRCA genes were analysed with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification . Consecutive paraffin sections were examined immunohistochemically for AR , ER , PR and Her-2/neu . RESULTS : Of the 135 tumours , 43 ( 32 % ) were P38398 -related , 18 ( 13 % ) were P51587 -related and 74 ( 55 % ) were P38398 /2-negative . Seventy-two per cent of the P38398 -related , 22 % of the P51587 -related and 12 % of the P38398 /2-negative tumours were triple ( ER , PR , Her2neu ) -negative . Eighty-four per cent of P38398 mutated cancers were high-grade ( P46379 ) tumours . ARs were expressed in 30 % ( 13 of 43 ) of P38398 -related , in 78 % ( 14 of 18 ) in P51587 -related tumours and in 76 % ( 56 of 74 ) in P38398 /2 negative tumours . Twenty-one per cent of ER-negative P38398 -related tumours expressed androgen receptors . CONCLUSION : Approximately one in five P38398 mutated breast cancers negative for ER and PR express androgen receptors . Modulation of AR might open a new avenue for treating these high-risk cancers .
