No effect of the oral neutral endopeptidase inhibitor candoxatril , on bronchomotor tone and histamine reactivity in asthma . P08473 ( NEP ) is found in many tissues in man , including the lung . Metabolism by NEP is one of the main mechanisms for the clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , a hormone that causes bronchodilation and reduces nonspecific bronchial reactivity in man . DB00616 , an oral NEP inhibitor has been shown to elevate circulating P01160 levels . We have sought to determine whether the administration of candoxatril will alter bronchomotor tone ( forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) ) and histamine reactivity . Ten male asthmatic patients with stable asthma were enrolled ( mean ( SD ) age 32 ( 10 ) yrs ; FEV1 92 ( 11 ) % predicted ) in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . On each study day , after baseline spirometry , patients received 200 mg of candoxatril or placebo . Spirometry was repeated at half hourly intervals . After 2 h a histamine inhalation test was performed . There was no significant difference in FEV1 values at baseline or at 2 h post-dosing between active and placebo study days , with mean ( SEM ) FEV1 at baseline and 2 h of 3.71 ( 0.29 ) l and 3.85 ( 0.29 ) l on the placebo day , and 3.89 ( 0.27 ) l and 4.05 ( 0.82 ) l on the active day , respectively . The geometric mean ( range ) provocative concentration of histamine producing a 20 % fall in FEV1 ( PC20 ) on the placebo day and active day did not differ significantly , being 1.17 ( 0.25-25.8 ) and 0.93 ( 0.13-32 ) mg.ml-1 , respectively.
