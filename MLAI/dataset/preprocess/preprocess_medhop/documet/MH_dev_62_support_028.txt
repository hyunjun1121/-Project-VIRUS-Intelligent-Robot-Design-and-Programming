DB08904 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . INTRODUCTION : Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , and subsequent development of targeted therapies , have greatly advanced the management of this chronic inflammatory disease . The aim of treatment is a state of clinical remission . DB08904 ( CZP ) is a novel pegylated P01375 alpha inhibitor ( TNFi ) therapy and is the focus of this review . AREAS COVERED : CZP is different from other TNFi as it contains a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) moiety , and lacks the constant fragment ( Fc ) of immunoglobulin ; therefore it does not activate complement . In this review in addition to clinical efficacy of CZP , effects on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes , are discussed . Adverse event data from clinical trials and extension studies are also reviewed . EXPERT OPINION : The addition of novel TNFi therapies to treat RA is welcomed . As well as displaying clinical efficacy , there is evidence to suggest that CZP has unique characteristics , including reduced transfer across the placenta and reduced frequency of injection site reactions . Furthermore , randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of CZP have demonstrated rapid improvements in workplace and home productivity in patients contributing to reducing the significant socioeconomic burden of RA .
