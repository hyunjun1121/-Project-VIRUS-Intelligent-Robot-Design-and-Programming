DB00952 mitigates CGRP1-associated motor neuron degeneration caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat tract . Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) is a motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of the CAG triplet repeat within the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene . Here , we demonstrated that pathogenic AR upregulates the gene encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide Î± ( CGRP1 ) . In neuronal cells , overexpression of CGRP1 induced cellular damage via the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway , whereas pharmacological suppression of CGRP1 or JNK attenuated the neurotoxic effects of pathogenic AR . The depletion of CGRP1 inactivated JNK and suppressed neurodegeneration in a mouse model of SBMA . DB00952 , a serotonin 1B/1D ( 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D , or P28222 /1D ) receptor agonist , decreased CGRP1 expression via the induction of dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1 ( P28562 ) , attenuated JNK activity and mitigated pathogenic AR-mediated neuronal damage in cellular and mouse SBMA models . These observations suggest that pharmacological activation of the P28222 /1D receptor may be used therapeutically to treat SBMA and other polyglutamine-related neurodegenerative diseases .
