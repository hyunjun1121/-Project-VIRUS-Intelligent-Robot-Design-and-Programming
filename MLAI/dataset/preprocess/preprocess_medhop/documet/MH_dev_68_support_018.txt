[ Relation between insulin secretion and action -- study of genetic determination ] . BACKGROUND : The disposition index represents insulin secretion related to the degree of insulin sensitivity , being constant for given degree of glucose tolerance . The aim of this study is to discern genetic determinants influencing the value of disposition index , e.g. predisposition to glucose intolerance . METHODS AND RESULTS : Two hundred and four non-diabetic subjects with varied glucose tolerance were divided into groups according to the values of disposition index . DB09341 and lipid metabolism , anthropometric parameters and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) were examined . The genotype frequency of candidate genes was compared between the groups of individuals within the lowest ( Q1 ) and the highest ( Q4 ) quartiles of the disposition index values . Those groups were not different concerning age and female to male ratio . Fasting and stimulated parameters of glucose metabolism and lipid profile were worse in group Q1 compared to group Q4 . Group Q1 is characterized with higher number of individuals with metabolic syndrome and family history of DM2 . The examination of candidate genes revealed the differences in genotype frequency of P07550 ( rs1042714 ) , Q07869 ( rs1800206 ) , Q14654 ( rs5219 ) , and Q8IWU4 ( rs13266634 ) between groups Q1 and Q4 . CONCLUSIONS : Low value of disposition index is related to the deterioration of glucose tolerance and other signs of metabolic syndrome . It is associated with genes affecting insulin secretion and genes related to energy metabolism and obesity .
