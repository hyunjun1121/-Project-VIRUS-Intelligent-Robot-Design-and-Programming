Gene expression profiles of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A and C subfamilies in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells . The purpose of this study was to quantify gene expression levels of the DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) transporter A and C subfamilies O95477 -A9 , and P33527 -6/Mrp1-6 , Q99622 /Mrp7 in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells ( RVEC ) using a combination of a magnetic isolation method for mouse RVEC and real-time quantitative PCR analysis . The transcript level of endothelial cell markers , such as CD31 , Tie-2 , claudin-5 , occludin , ABCB1a/mdr1a , and Q9UNQ0 , were more than 20-fold higher than those in the non-RVEC fraction , suggesting that RVEC in the RVEC fraction are concentrated at least 20-fold compared with those of the non-RVEC fraction . In the O95477 to A9 families , the transcript level of Q99758 and A9 in the RVEC fraction was 1.2- and 32-fold higher than that in the non-RVEC fraction . Although Q99758 was expressed in both the RVEC and non-RVEC fractions , A9 is predominantly expressed in the RVEC fraction . In the P33527 to P13671 and Q99622 families , the transcript level of O15438 , C4 , and P13671 in the RVEC fraction was 27- , 251- , and 242-fold higher , respectively , than that in the non-RVEC fraction , suggesting that O15438 , C4 , and P13671 are predominantly expressed in the RVEC . In conclusion , Q99758 , Q8IUA7 , O15438 , O15439 , and O95255 mRNAs are predominantly expressed at the inner blood-retina barrier ( inner BRB ) and appear to play a major role in the efflux transport of their substrates at the inner BRB .
