DB00898 -related expectancies are associated with the D2 dopamine receptor and GABAA receptor beta3 subunit genes . Molecular genetic research has identified promising markers of alcohol dependence , including alleles of the D2 dopamine receptor ( P14416 ) and the GABAA receptor beta3 subunit ( P28472 ) genes . Whether such genetic risk manifests itself in stronger alcohol-related outcome expectancies , or in difficulty resisting alcohol , is unknown . In the present study , A1+ ( A1A1 and A1A2 genotypes ) and A1- ( A2A2 genotype ) alleles of the P14416 and P55008 + ( G1G1 and P55008 non- P55008 genotypes ) and P55008 - ( non- P55008 non- P55008 genotype ) alleles of the P28472 gene were determined in a group of 56 medically ill patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence . Mood-related alcohol expectancy ( AE ) and drinking refusal self-efficacy ( DRSE ) were assessed using the Drinking Expectancy Profile ( Manual for the Drinking Expectancy Profile , Behaviour Research and Therapy Centre , Brisbane , 1996 ) . Patients with the P14416 A1+ allele , compared with those with the P14416 A1- allele , reported significantly lower DRSE in situations of social pressure . Similarly , lower DRSE was reported under social pressure by patients with the P28472 P55008 + allele when compared to those with the P28472 P55008 - alleles . Patients with the P28472 P55008 + allele also revealed reduced DRSE in situations characterized by negative affect than those with the P28472 P55008 - alleles . Patients carrying the P28472 P55008 + allele showed stronger AE relating to negative affective change ( for example , increased depression ) than their P28472 P55008 - counterparts . Biological influence in the development of some classes of cognitions is hypothesized . The clinical implications , particularly with regard to patient-treatment matching and the development of an integrated psychological and pharmacogenetic approach , are discussed .
