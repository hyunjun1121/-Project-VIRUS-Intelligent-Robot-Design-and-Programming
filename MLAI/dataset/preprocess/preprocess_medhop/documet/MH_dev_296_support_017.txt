Molecular basis for the immunostimulatory activity of guanine nucleoside analogs : activation of Q9NYK1 . Certain Q99618 -substituted and N7 , Q99618 -disubstituted guanine ribonucleosides comprise a class of small molecules with immunostimulatory activity . In a variety of animal models , these agents stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses . The antiviral actions of these guanosine analogs have been attributed to their ability to induce type I IFNs . However , the molecular mechanisms by which the guanosine analogs potentiate immune responses are not known . Here , we report that several guanosine analogs activate Q9NYK1 ( Q9NYK1 ) . DB04860 , 7-deazaguanosine , and related guanosine analogs activated mouse immune cells in a manner analogous to known TLR ligands , inducing cytokine production in mouse splenocytes ( P05231 and IL-12 , type I and II IFNs ) , bone marrow-derived macrophages ( P05231 and IL-12 ) , and in human peripheral blood leukocytes ( type I IFNs , tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-12 ) . The guanosine congeners also up-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC I/II in dendritic cells . Genetic complementation studies in human embryonic kidney 293 cells confirmed that the guanosine analogs activate cells exclusively via Q9NYK1 . The stimulation of Q9NYK1 by the guanosine analogs in human cells appears to require endosomal maturation because inhibition of this process with chloroquine significantly reduced the downstream activation of NF-kappaB . However , Q9NR97 activation by R-848 and O60603 activation by [ S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-R- DB00151 -S- DB00133 -Lys4-OH , trihydrochloride ) ] were not inhibited by chloroquine , whereas Q9NR96 activation by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was abolished . In summary , we present evidence that guanosine analogs activate immune cells via Q9NYK1 by a pathway that requires endosomal maturation . Thus , the B cell-stimulating and antiviral activities of the guanosine analogs may be explained by their Q9NYK1 -activating capacity .
