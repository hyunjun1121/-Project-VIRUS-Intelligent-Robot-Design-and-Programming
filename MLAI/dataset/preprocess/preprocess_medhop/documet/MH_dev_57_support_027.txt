Involvement of multiple elements in Q96RI1 -mediated transcriptional activation of O95750 . The intestinal endocrine hormone human fibroblast growth factor 19 ( O95750 ) is involved in the regulation of not only hepatic bile acid metabolism but also carbohydrate and lipid metabolism . In the present study , bile acid/farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) responsiveness in the O95750 promoter region was investigated by a reporter assay using the human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T . The assay revealed the presence of bile acid/ Q96RI1 -responsive elements in the 5'-flanking region up to 8.8 kb of O95750 . Deletion analysis indicated that regions from -1866 to -1833 , from -1427 to -1353 , and from -75 to +262 were involved in Q96RI1 responsiveness . Four , four , and two consecutive half-sites of nuclear receptors were observed in the three regions , respectively . An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay revealed Q96RI1 /retinoid X receptor α ( RXRα ) heterodimer binding in these three regions . EMSA and reporter assays using mutated constructs indicated that the nuclear receptor Q9Y2I1 , ER2 , and Q30134 motifs in the 5'-flanking region were involved in Q96RI1 responsiveness of O95750 . Lithocholic acid ( LCA ) ( 10 μM ) , chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) ( 10 μM ) , or GW4064 ( 0.1 μM ) treatment increased reporter activity in a construct including the three motifs under Q96RI1 -expressing conditions whereas LCA and not DB06777 or GW4064 treatment increased the reporter activity under pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) -expressing conditions . These results suggest that O95750 is transcriptionally activated through multiple Q96RI1 -responsive elements in the promoter region .
