DB00644 specific binding sites in uterine leiomyomata . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) analogs can cause regression of uterine leiomyomata . This effect is thought to be mediated by the inhibition of gonadotropin release and steroid synthesis . In the present study we examined the possibility that these analogs may also act directly on uterine leiomyomata . Specific binding sites for DB00644 are present in myoma membranes , as 125I- DB06719 binding was displaced with equal efficiency by the superagonists , DB06719 and D-Trp6- DB00644 , and by the antagonist Organon 30276 , but not by unrelated peptides such as thyrotropin releasing hormone and oxytocin . A nonlinear Scatchard curve obtained for DB06719 specific binding suggests the presence of at least two binding sites , one of which exhibits a relatively high affinity for DB00644 analogs ( Kd of approximately 10(-8) M ) . Western blotting with a specific P30968 antibody revealed the presence of a 60 kDa protein in myoma membranes . This protein has a similar molecular weight to the purified pituitary P30968 . These results indicate , for the first time , the presence of specific binding sites for DB00644 in uterine leiomyomata , suggesting a direct effect of DB00644 analogs on this tissue .
