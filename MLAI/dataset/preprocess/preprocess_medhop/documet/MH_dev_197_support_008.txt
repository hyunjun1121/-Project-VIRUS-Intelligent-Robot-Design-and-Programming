P10275 repression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone gene transcription via enhancer 1 . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) plays a major role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal ( HPG ) axis , and synthesis and secretion of DB00644 are regulated by gonadal steroid hormones . Disruptions in androgen levels are involved in a number of reproductive defects , including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and polycystic ovarian syndrome . Androgens down-regulate DB00644 mRNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro via an androgen receptor ( AR ) -dependent mechanism . DB02998 ( R1881 ) , a synthetic AR agonist , represses DB00644 expression through multiple sites in the proximal promoter . In this study , we show AR also represses DB00644 transcription via the major enhancer ( DB00644 -E1 ) . A multimer of the -1800/-1766 region was repressed by R1881 treatment . Mutation of two bases , -1792 and -1791 , resulted in decreased basal activity and a loss of AR-mediated repression . AR bound to the -1796/-1791 sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays , indicating a direct interaction with DNA or other transcription factors in this region . We conclude that AR repression of DB00644 -E1 acts via multiple AR-responsive regions , including the site at -1792/-1791 .
