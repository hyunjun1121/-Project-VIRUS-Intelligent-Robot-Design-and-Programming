Effects of an alpha 7-nicotinic agonist on default network activity in schizophrenia . BACKGROUND : 3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine ( DB05708 ) is a partial agonist at α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that has been evaluated clinically for treatment of schizophrenia . This study examined the effects of DB05708 on default network activity as a biomarker for drug effects on pathologic brain function associated with schizophrenia . METHODS : Placebo and two doses of DB05708 were administered in a random , double-blind crossover design during a Phase 2 study of DB05708 . Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 16 nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia while they performed a simple eye movement task . Independent component analysis was used to identify the default network component . Default network changes were evaluated in the context of a polymorphism in P36544 , the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene , which was previously found to be associated with schizophrenia . RESULTS : Compared with placebo , both 150 and 75 mg twice daily DB05708 altered default network activity , including a reduction in posterior cingulate , inferior parietal cortex , and medial frontal gyrus activity and an increase in precuneus activity . The most robust difference , posterior cingulate activity reduction , was affected by P36544 genotype . CONCLUSIONS : The observed DB05708 -related changes are consistent with improved default network function in schizophrenia . Pharmacogenetic analysis indicates mediation of the effect through the α7-nicotinic receptor . These results further implicate nicotinic cholinergic dysfunction in the disease and suggest that default network activity may be a useful indicator of biological effects of novel therapeutic agents .
