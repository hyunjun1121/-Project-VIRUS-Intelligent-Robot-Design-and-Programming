Q07869 -γ regulates carnitine homeostasis and mitochondrial function in a lamb model of increased pulmonary blood flow . OBJECTIVE : DB00583 homeostasis is disrupted in lambs with endothelial dysfunction secondary to increased pulmonary blood flow ( Shunt ) . Our recent studies have also indicated that the disruption in carnitine homeostasis correlates with a decrease in Q07869 -γ expression in Shunt lambs . Thus , this study was carried out to determine if there is a causal link between loss of Q07869 -γ signaling and carnitine dysfunction , and whether the Q07869 -γ agonist , rosiglitazone preserves carnitine homeostasis in Shunt lambs . METHODS AND RESULTS : siRNA-mediated Q07869 -γ knockdown significantly reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 ( CPT1 and 2 ) and carnitine acetyltransferase ( P43155 ) protein levels . This decrease in carnitine regulatory proteins resulted in a disruption in carnitine homeostasis and induced mitochondrial dysfunction , as determined by a reduction in cellular DB00171 levels . In turn , the decrease in cellular DB00171 attenuated NO signaling through a reduction in P29474 /Hsp90 interactions and enhanced P29474 uncoupling . In vivo , rosiglitazone treatment preserved carnitine homeostasis and attenuated the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in Shunt lambs maintaining DB00171 levels . This in turn preserved P29474 /Hsp90 interactions and NO signaling . CONCLUSION : Our study indicates that Q07869 -γ signaling plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function through the regulation of carnitine homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo . Further , it identifies a new mechanism by which Q07869 -γ regulates NO signaling through Hsp90 . Thus , Q07869 -γ agonists may have therapeutic potential in preventing the endothelial dysfunction in children with increased pulmonary blood flow .
