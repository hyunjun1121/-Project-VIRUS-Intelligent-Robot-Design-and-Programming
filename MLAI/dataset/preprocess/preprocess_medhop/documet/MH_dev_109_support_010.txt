Rapid and sustained coronary artery recanalization with combined bolus injection of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and monoclonal antiplatelet P08514 /IIIa antibody in a canine preparation . The effects of bolus injections of recombinant single-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) and of F(ab')2 fragments of a murine monoclonal antibody ( DB00054 ) against the human platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor [ 7E3-F(ab')2 ] on coronary arterial thrombolysis and reocclusion was studied in a canine preparation of coronary artery thrombosis superimposed on high-grade stenosis . Bolus intravenous injections of rt-PA at a dose of 0.45 mg/kg , repeated at 15 min intervals until reperfusion occurred ( maximum of four injections ) caused reperfusion in five of seven dogs within 100 min ( 33 +/- 15 min , mean +/- SD ) . Reperfusion was rapidly followed ( generally within 10 min ) by reocclusion and then by periods of cyclical reflow and reocclusion . A single intravenous injection of 7E3-F(ab')2 alone at 0.8 mg/kg caused reperfusion within 100 min in two of six dogs ( 19 and 37 min ) without subsequent reocclusion . Single bolus injections of different amounts ( 0.1 to 0.8 mg/kg ) of 7E3-F(ab')2 were then combined with bolus injections of 0.45 mg/kg of rt-PA . Stable reperfusion without reocclusion was accomplished with 0.8 or 0.6 mg/kg 7E3-F(ab')2 and a single injection of 0.45 mg/kg rt-PA within 6 +/- 3 min ( n = 6 , p less than .01 ) and 8 +/- 5 min ( n = 5 , p less than .02 ) , respectively . None of these animals suffered reocclusion of the coronary artery . Lower doses ( 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg ) of 7E3-F(ab')2 did not significantly shorten the time to reperfusion and did not prevent reocclusion. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
