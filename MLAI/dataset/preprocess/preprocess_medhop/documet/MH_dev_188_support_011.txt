Development of a pharmacodynamic assay based on PLCγ2 phosphorylation for quantifying spleen tyrosine kinase ( P43405 ) -Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) signaling . P43405 ( P43405 ) and Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) are key mediators in coupling cell surface receptors , such as the B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) , to downstream signaling events affecting diverse biological functions . There is therefore tremendous interest in the development of pharmacological inhibitors targeting the P43405 - Q06187 axis for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and hematological malignancies . A good pharmacodynamic ( PD ) assay , ideally a blood-based assay that measures proximal events , is warranted for evaluation of such inhibitors . In platelets , collagen-induced activation of membrane glycoprotein Q9HCN6 is dependent on the P43405 - Q06187 axis . Here , we report the development of a novel immunoassay that uses the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay ( DELFIA ) to measure Q9HCN6 -mediated phosphorylation of phospholipase C γ2 ( PLCγ2 ) , a direct substrate of P43405 and Q06187 , in platelets . The assay was validated using P43405 or Q06187 inhibitors and generated IC50 correlated with those from the P11274 -induced B-cell activation assay . Furthermore , this assay showed good stability and uniformity over a period of 24 h in different donors . Interestingly , compound IC50 values using blood from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were slightly higher compared with those produced using samples from healthy donors . This novel platelet PLCγ2 phosphorylation-based immunoassay should serve as a promising PD assay for preclinical and clinical development of inhibitors targeting the P43405 - Q06187 axis .
