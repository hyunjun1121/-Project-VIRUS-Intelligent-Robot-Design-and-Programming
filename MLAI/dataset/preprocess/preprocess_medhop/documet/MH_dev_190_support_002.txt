Presence of a P34969 receptor positively coupled to adenylate cyclase activation in human granulosa-lutein cells . Although serotonin ( 5-HT ) has been shown to stimulate progesterone production by human granulosa-lutein cells ( hGLC ) , the receptor type and associated signaling pathway remain uncharacterized . We report here that 5-HT receptors in these cells are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase activity . Formation of DB02527 was stimulated by 5-HT and its agonists in a dose- and time-dependent manner . DB06148 , amoxapine , and loxapine were equipotent in antagonizing 5-HT-induced DB02527 formation . For both DB02527 formation in cells and adenylate cyclase assay using membrane fractions , the rank order of potency for agonists of 5-HT were : 5-carboxy-aminotryptamine > 5-HT > or =5-methoxytryptamine , consistent with a typical pharmacological profile of human 5-ht7 ( h5-ht7 ) receptor . Sequence data of amplified complementary DNA fragments reverse transcribed from hGLC RNA revealed complete identity with published sequence of h5-ht7 receptor complementary DNA . Northern analysis showed the presence of 2.8-kb h5-ht7 transcripts in hGLC . The three variants h5-ht7A , h5-ht7B , and h5-ht7D were also detected in hGLC . Preincubation of hGLC with 5-HT ( 10(-8)-10(-6) M ) resulted in a marked reduction in the DB02527 response when the cells were subsequently stimulated with gonadotropin , and this heterologous desensitization could be reversed by 5-ht7 receptor antagonist clozapine . These data demonstrate that h5-ht7 receptor is present and stimulate DB02527 formation in hGLC . In addition , the h5-ht7 receptor seems to be implicated in the heterologous down-regulation hCG-stimulated DB02527 response in hGLC , with a possible ramification for luteal insufficiency .
