Cross-communication between histone H3 and H4 acetylation and Akt- P42345 signalling in prostate cancer cells . Molecular tumour targeting has significantly improved anti-cancer protocols . Still , the addition of molecular targeting to the treatment regime has not led to a curative breakthrough . Combined mammalian target of DB00877 ( P42345 ) and histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibition has been shown not only to enhance anti-tumour potential , but also to prevent resistance development seen under mono-drug therapy . This investigation was designed to evaluate whether cross-communication exists between P42345 signalling and epigenetic events regulated by HDAC . DU-145 prostate cancer cells were treated with insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) to activate the Akt- P42345 cascade or with the HDAC-inhibitor valproic acid ( DB00313 ) to induce histone H3 and H4 acetylation ( aH3 , aH4 ) . Subsequently , P42345 , Rictor , Q8N122 , p70s6k , Akt ( all : total and phosphorylated ) , H3 and H4 ( total and acetylated ) were analysed by western blotting . Both techniques revealed a link between P42345 and the epigenetic machinery . IGF activated P42345 , Rictor , Q8N122 , p70s6k and Akt , but also enhanced aH3 and aH4 . Inversely , IGFr blockade and knock-down blocked the Akt- P42345 axis , but simultaneously diminished aH3 and aH4 . DB00313 treatment up-regulated histone acetylation , but also activated P42345 -Akt signalling . Q13547 and 2 knock-down revealed that the interaction with the P42345 system is initiated by histone H3 acetylation . HDAC- P42345 communication , therefore , is apparent whereby tumour-promoting ( Akt/ P42345 (high) , aH3/aH4(low) ) and tumour-suppressing signals ( Akt/ P42345 (low) , aH3/aH4(high) ) are activated in parallel . Combined use of an HDAC- and P42345 inhibitor might then diminish pro-tumour effects triggered by the HDAC- ( Akt/ P42345 (high) ) or P42345 inhibitor ( aH3/aH4(low) ) alone .
