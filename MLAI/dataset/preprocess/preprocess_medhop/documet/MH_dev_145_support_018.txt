DB00173 nucleotides inhibit cytokine generation by human mast cells through a Gs-coupled receptor . DB00171 and ADP activate functionally distinct G protein-coupled purinergic ( P2Y ) receptors . We determined the expression and function of adenine nucleotide-specific P2Y receptors on cord blood-derived human mast cells ( hMCs ) . Human MCs expressed mRNA encoding the ADP-specific P47900 , Q9H244 , and Q9BPV8 receptors ; the DB00171 /UTP-specific P41231 receptor ; and the DB00171 -selective Q96G91 receptor . ADP ( 0.05-50 muM ) induced calcium flux that was completely blocked by a P47900 receptor-selective antagonist and was not cross-desensitized by DB00171 . Low doses of ADP induced strong phosphorylation of P29323 and p38 MAPKs ; higher doses stimulated eicosanoid production and exocytosis . Although MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by a combination of P47900 - and Q9H244 -selective antagonists , neither interfered with secretion responses . Unexpectedly , both ADP and DB00171 inhibited the generation of P01375 in response to the O60603 ligand , peptidoglycan , and blocked the production of P01375 , P10145 , and MIP-1beta in response to leukotriene D(4) . These effects were mimicked by two DB00171 analogues , adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate ( BzATP ) , but not by adenosine . ADP , DB00171 , adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) , and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate each induced DB02527 accumulation , stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB , and up-regulated the expression of inducible DB02527 early repressor , a CREB-dependent inhibitor of cytokine transcription . Human MCs thus express several ADP-selective P2Y receptors and at least one G(s)-coupled ADP/ DB00171 receptor . Nucleotides could therefore contribute to MC-dependent microvascular leakage in atherosclerosis , tissue injury , and innate immunity while simultaneously limiting the extent of subsequent inflammation by attenuating the generation of inducible cytokines by MCs .
