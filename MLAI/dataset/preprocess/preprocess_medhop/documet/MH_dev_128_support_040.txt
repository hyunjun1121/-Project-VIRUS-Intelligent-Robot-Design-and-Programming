Domain organization of the DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel complex examined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer . K( DB00171 ) channels link cell metabolism to excitability in many cells . They are formed as tetramers of Kir6.2 subunits , each associated with a Q09428 subunit . We used mutant GFP-based FRET to assess domain organization in channel complexes . Q8N1N2 -length Kir6.2 subunits were linked to YFP or cyan fluorescent protein ( P27918 ) at N or C termini , and all such constructs , including double-tagged YFP-Kir6.2- P27918 ( Y6.2C ) , formed functional K( DB00171 ) channels . In intact COSm6 cells , background emission of YFP excited by 430-nm light was ∼6 % , but the Y6.2C construct expressed alone exhibited an apparent FRET efficiency of ∼25 % , confirmed by trypsin digestion , with or without Q09428 co-expression . Similar FRET efficiency was detected in mixtures of P27918 - and YFP-tagged full-length Kir6.2 subunits and transmembrane domain only constructs , when tagged at the C termini but not at the N termini . The FRET-reported Kir6.2 tetramer domain organization was qualitatively consistent with Kir channel crystal structures : C termini and M2 domains are centrally located relative to N termini and M1 domains , respectively . Additional FRET analyses were performed on cells in which tagged full-length Kir6.2 and tagged Q09428 constructs were co-expressed . These analyses further revealed that 1 ) NBD1 of Q09428 is closer to the C terminus of Kir6.2 than to the N terminus ; 2 ) the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is not essential for complexation with Q09428 ; and 3 ) the N-terminal half of Q09428 can complex with itself in the absence of either the C-terminal half or Kir6.2 .
