8-Hydroxyquinoline and hydroxamic acid inhibitors of botulinum neurotoxin DB00083 . We describe here the state of the art of certain aspects concerning potential small molecule therapy directed toward botulism , by inhibition of the zinc-protease containing light chain ( LC ) of botulinum neurotoxin DB00083 from the anaerobic bacillus Clostridium botulinum . Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) are comprised of eight serologically-distinct proteins ( A - H ) , several of which are further divided , such as DB00083 which has five subtypes . The BoNTs are the most toxic substances known to mankind , causing a form of flaccid paralysis that can be rapid and is often lethal . DB00083 is comprised of a ~100 kDa heavy chain ( HC ) attached via a single disulfide DB00151 - DB00151 bond to a ~50 kDa LC . The HC mediates transport to and uptake by presynaptic glutamatergic neurons , where the LC cleaves the protein P60880 and thus prevents vesicular trafficking and release of acetylcholine . The Zn-endoprotease activity of the LC of DB00083 is a target for the development of small molecule inhibitors of DB00083 -mediated toxicity . A variety of DB00083 LC inhibitors have been described to date and we focus here primarily on the Zn-binding 8-hydroxyquinoline structural type as well as some of the previously-described hydroxamic acids .
