A multi-layer inference approach to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation . An important topic in systems biology is the reverse engineering of regulatory mechanisms through reconstruction of context-dependent gene networks . A major challenge is to identify the genes and the regulations specific to a condition or phenotype , given that regulatory processes are highly connected such that a specific response is typically accompanied by numerous collateral effects . In this study , we design a multi-layer approach that is able to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation through an integrative analysis of large-scale information of gene expression , protein interaction and transcriptional regulation ( transcription factor-target gene relationships ) . We establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic datasets , as well as a yeast dataset . We then extend the framework to the application of higher eukaryotic systems , including human breast cancer and Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation . Our study identified P09758 ( P09758 ) as a target gene for human breast cancer and discovered its regulation by transcription factors CREB , as well as NFkB . We also predict Q99661 is a target gene for ER-/ P04626 - breast cancer and is positively regulated by Q01094 . The predictions were further confirmed through experimental studies .
