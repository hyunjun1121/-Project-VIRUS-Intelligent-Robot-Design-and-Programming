Individual cerebellar Purkinje cells express different cGMP phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) : in vivo phosphorylation of cGMP-specific PDE ( O76074 ) as an indicator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) activation . The nitric oxide ( NO ) -cGMP pathway has been implicated as playing a crucial role in the induction of cerebellar long-term depression ( LTD ) . The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal is controlled by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) . Here we identify O76074 and Q01064 as the two major cGMP-hydrolyzing PDEs specifically and differentially expressed in the Purkinje neurons of mouse cerebellum . O76074 was found in all Purkinje neurons , whereas Q01064 was detected only in a subset of these cells , suggesting that individual Purkinje cells may differentially regulate cGMP , depending on the PDE isozymes expressed . Although expression of guanylate cyclase and/or cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) in Purkinje cells have been reported , neither cGMP accumulation nor PKG activation in these cells in vivo has been demonstrated . To determine if changes in PKG activation and O76074 regulation occur in vivo we have examined the phosphorylation of O76074 in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses using a phosphospecific O76074 antibody . Injection of sodium nitroprusside or selective PKG activators into the lateral ventricle of mouse brain induced O76074 phosphorylation in vivo , but was completely missing in Purkinje cell-specific PKG I knock-out mice . In cerebellar slices , treatment with sildenafil or DB07954 led to different levels of phospho- O76074 accumulation and activation of O76074 . These results suggest that phosphorylation of O76074 in Purkinje neurons after cGMP-PKG activation performs a critical role in the termination of the cGMP signal during LTD progression ; moreover , O76074 phosphorylation may be used as an in vivo indicator for PKG activation .
