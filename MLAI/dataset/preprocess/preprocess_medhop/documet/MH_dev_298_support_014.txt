DB08885 . Metastatic colorectal cancer : at least as poorly tolerated as bevacizumab . The Folfiri protocol is often proposed to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in relapse or treatment failure after the Folfox protocol . The benefit of adding a monoclonal antibody is far from certain . In two trials , addition of bevacizumab , a P15692 inhibitor , to a second-line regimen prolonged survival by about two months , at a cost of many additional serious or even life-threatening adverse effects . DB08885 ( Zaltrap , Sanofi Aventis ) , another P15692 inhibitor , has been authorised in the European Union as an adjunct to the Folfiri protocol in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in treatment failure or relapse after a first-line regimen including oxaliplatin ( Folfox protocol , for example ) . DB08885 has not been compared with bevacizumab in this setting . In a double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial including 1226 patients , adding aflibercept to the Folfiri protocol prolonged median overall survival by about 1.5 months . In this trial , 83 % of patients in the aflibercept group experienced at least one serious adverse event , versus 62 % of patients in the placebo group . DB08885 had the typical adverse effect profile of P15692 inhibitors , which includes arterial hypertension , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , bleeding , fistulae , bowel perforation , leukoencephalopathy , and delayed wound healing . Adding aflibercept also increased the frequency of certain adverse effects of the Folfiri protocol , including diarrhoea , dehydration , mucositis , infections and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia . The adverse effects of aflibercept were fatal in some patients . In practice , patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in treatment failure or relapse after first-line therapy should not expect too much from the addition of aflibercept or bevacizumab to a second-line protocol .
