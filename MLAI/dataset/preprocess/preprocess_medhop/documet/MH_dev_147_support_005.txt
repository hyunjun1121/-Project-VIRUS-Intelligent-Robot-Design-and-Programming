P04035 inhibitors up-regulate anti-aging klotho mRNA via RhoA inactivation in IMCD3 cells . OBJECTIVE : Q9UEF7 is thought to play a critical role in the development of age-related disorders including arteriosclerosis . Statins may exert vascular protective effects , independent of the lowering of plasma cholesterol levels . We investigated the impact of statins on mRNA expression of the age-suppressor gene , klotho in mIMCD3 cells . METHODS AND RESULTS : Q9UEF7 mRNA levels were evaluated with real-time RT-PCR . DB01076 and pitavastatin increased the expression of klotho mRNA in a dose-dependent manner . This stimulatory effect was abolished by the addition of mevalonate , GGPP and FPP , essential molecules for isoprenylation of the small GTPase Rho . As was the case with the statin treatment , inhibition of Rho-kinase by Y27632 up-regulated klotho mRNA . In contrast to the statin treatment , stimulation with angiotensin II down-regulated klotho mRNA expression without obvious morphological changes . Furthermore , pretreatment with atorvastatin blunted the angiotensin II-induced response and ameliorated the decrease in klotho mRNA expression towards basal levels . RhoA activity was further evaluated by detection of its translocation . Angiotensin II activated RhoA , whereas statins potently inactivated RhoA and blocked RhoA activation by angiotensin II . CONCLUSION : Statins inactivate the RhoA pathway , resulting in over-expression of klotho mRNA , which may contribute to the novel pleiotropic effects of statins towards vascular protection .
