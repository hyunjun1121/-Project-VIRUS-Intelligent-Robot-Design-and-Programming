The effect of DB00163 on monocyte proatherogenic activity . Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Westernized populations . The monocyte is a crucial cell in the genesis of the atherosclerotic lesion and is present during all stages of atherosclerosis . alpha-Tocopherol ( AT ) is the most active component of the vitamin E family and is the principal and most potent lipid-soluble antioxidant in plasma and LDL . With regard to monocyte function , AT supplementation ( 1200 IU/d ) has been shown to decrease release of reactive oxygen species , lipid oxidation , release of cytokines such as interleukin-1ss ( IL-1ss ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and decrease adhesion of monocytes to human endothelium . The mechanism of inhibition of superoxide and lipid oxidation by monocytes appears to be via inhibition of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the decrease in IL-1ss and P01375 release by inhibition of P09917 and the inhibition of monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion via decrease in adhesion molecules on monocytes , CD11b and VLA-4 and by decreasing DNA-binding activity of nuclear transcription factor kappaB . Thus , in addition to the decrease in oxidative stress resulting from AT supplementation , as evidenced by decreased F(2)-isoprostanes and LDL oxidizability , AT is anti-inflammatory and exerts beneficial antiatherogenic effects on cells crucial in atherogenesis such as monocytes .
