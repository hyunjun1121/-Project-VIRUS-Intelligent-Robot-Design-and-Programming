Predictive model for risk of severe gastrointestinal toxicity following chemotherapy using patient immune genetics and type of cancer : a pilot study . PURPOSE : Severe chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity ( CIGT ) is common and results in treatment delays , dose reductions , and potential premature treatment discontinuation . Currently , there is no diagnostic marker to predict CIGT . Proinflammatory cytokines , produced via toll-like receptor signaling , are key mediators of this toxicity . Hence , this pilot study investigated the association between immune genetic variability and severe CIGT risk . METHODS : Genomic DNA from 34 patients ( 10 with severe CIGT ) who had received 5-fluoruracil-based chemotherapy regimens was analyzed for variants of IL-1B , P60568 , P05231 , IL-6R , P22301 , P01375 , TGF-b , O60603 , O00206 , Q9Y6Y9 , Q99836 , P23560 , CRP , ICE , and P35372 . Multivariate logistic regression created a prediction model of severe CIGT risk . RESULTS : There were no significant differences between patients with and without severe CIGT with regards to age , sex , type of cancer , or chemotherapy treatment regimens . The prediction model of severe CIGT risk included O60603 and P01375 genetic variability and cancer type ( colorectal and gastric ) . This prediction model was both specific and sensitive , with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve of 87.3 % . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first report of immune genetic variability , together with cancer type , being predictive of severe CIGT risk . These outcomes are being validated in a larger patient population .
