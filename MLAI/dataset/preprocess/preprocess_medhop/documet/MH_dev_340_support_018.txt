Action of rolipram on specific DB05876 DB02527 phosphodiesterase isoforms and on the phosphorylation of DB02527 -response-element-binding protein ( CREB ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase in U937 monocytic cells . U937 monocytic cells are shown here to express a range of DB05876 , DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) isoenzymes : the long isoenzymes , PDE4A4 , PDE4D5 and PDE4D3 , plus the short isoenzyme , PDE4B2 . These isoenzymes provide around 76 % of the total DB02527 PDE activity of U937 cells . The specific activities of the total P27815 , Q07343 and Q08499 activities were 0.63+/-0.09 , 8.8+/-0.2 and 34.4+/-2.9 pmol/min per mg of protein respectively . The DB05876 selective inhibitor , rolipram , inhibited immunopurified Q07343 and Q08499 activities similarly , with IC(50) values of approx . 130 nM and 240 nM respectively . In contrast , rolipram inhibited immunopurified P27815 activity with a dramatically lower IC(50) value of around 3 nM . DB01954 increased phosphorylation of DB02527 -response-element-binding protein ( CREB ) in U937 cells in a dose-dependent fashion , which implied the presence of both high affinity ( IC(50) value approx. 1 nM ) and low affinity ( IC(50) value approx. 120 nM ) components . DB01954 dose-dependently inhibited the interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) -stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase in a simple monotonic fashion with an IC(50) value of approx . 290 nM . On this basis , it is suggested that rolipram inhibition of PDE4A4 is involved in regulating CREB phosphorylation but not P01579 -stimulated p38 Q96HU1 kinase phosphorylation . PDE4A4 was also selectively activated by challenge of U937 cells with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or P01579 through a process which was attenuated by both wortmannin and rapamycin . It is proposed that the PDE4A4 isoform is involved in compartmentalized DB02527 signalling responses in U937 monocytes .
