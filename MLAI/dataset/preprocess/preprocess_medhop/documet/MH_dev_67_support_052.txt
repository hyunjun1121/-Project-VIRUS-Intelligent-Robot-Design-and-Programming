Tonic , but not phasic corticosterone , constrains stress activatedextracellular-regulated-kinase 1/ 2 immunoreactivity within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus . The negative-feedback actions of corticosterone ( O00230 ) depend on both phasic and tonic O00230 secretion patterns to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis activity . How these two different O00230 secretion pattens influence specific intracellular signal transduction pathway activity within the cellular elements of the Q9Y251 axis has not been determined . For example , it is unknown whether O00230 has suppressive actions over signal transduction events within medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) neurones , nor whether these suppressive actions are responsible for alterations in PVN transcriptional processes and neurohormone secretion associated with stress . The extracellular-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) is a stress activated intracellular signalling molecule that is potentially subject to glucocorticoid negative-feedback regulation . We tested the ability of O00230 to modulate levels of the active ( phosphorylated ) form of P29323 ( pERK1/2 ) in the PVN of rats . Acute psychological stress ( restraint ) produced a rapid increase in the number of PVN pERK1/2 immunopositive cells within P06850 neurones . Absence of tonic O00230 via adrenalectomy ( P10109 ) produced no change in basal pERK1/2 cell counts but augmented the increased pERK1/2 cell counts elicited by acute restraint . Treatment of P10109 rats with O00230 in the drinking water normalised this enhanced pERK1/2 response to stress . By contrast , treatment of P10109 rats with a phasic increase in O00230 1 h before restraint had no effect on pERK1/2 cell counts , despite substantially suppressing stress-induced PVN crh gene expression and adrenonocorticotrophic hormone secretion . This tonic O00230 inhibition of stress-induced activation of P27361 /2 may involve both alteration of the activity of stress-dependent neural inputs to PVN P06850 neurones and alteration within those neurones of stress-dependent intracellular signalling mechanisms associated with P29323 activation .
