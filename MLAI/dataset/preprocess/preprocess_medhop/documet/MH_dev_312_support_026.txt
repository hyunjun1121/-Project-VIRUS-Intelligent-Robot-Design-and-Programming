Expression of vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( P15428 ) in benign and malignant ovarian tissue and DB00146 ( 25(OH2)D3 ) and prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) serum level in ovarian cancer patients . Ovarian carcinomas are associated with increased inflammation which is based upon an up-regulation of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) . Moreover , based on our previous published data , the extra-renal vitamin D metabolism seems to be dysregulated in comparison to healthy tissue . In order to gain further insight into the prostaglandin ( PG ) - and vitamin D-metabolism in ovarian carcinomas , the study aimed to evaluate the expression of the PG metabolising enzymes P35354 and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( P15428 ) compared to the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in benign and malignant ovarian tissues . Additionally , we determined the DB00146 ( 25(OH2)D3 ) serum levels . Expression of P11473 , P35354 and P15428 was determined by Western blot analysis . Serum levels of 25(OH2)D3 and DB00917 were measured by chemiluminescence-based and colorimetric immunoassay . We detected significantly higher expressions of the PG metabolising enzymes P15428 and P35354 in malignant tissue and DB00917 serum levels were 2-fold higher in tumour patients . Furthermore , we found an inverse correlation to the P11473 -expression which was 62.1 % lower in malignant tissues compared to that in benign tissues . Surprisingly , we could not detect any differences between the 25(OH2)D3 serum levels in either group ( n=20 ) . These data suggest a correlation between PG- and vitamin D-metabolism in ovarian carcinomas .
