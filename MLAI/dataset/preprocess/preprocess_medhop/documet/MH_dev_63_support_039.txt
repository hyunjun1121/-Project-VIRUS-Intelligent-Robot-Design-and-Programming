(Pro)renin promotes fibrosis gene expression in P29320 cells through a Nox4-dependent mechanism . The (pro)renin receptor ( PRR ) has recently been demonstrated to bind equally well renin and its precursor , prorenin , leading to a similar intracellular signaling independent of angiotensin II . In this study , we report that human embryonic kidney cells ( P29320 ) exposed to renin or prorenin for 24 h in the presence of a blocking concentration of the angtiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindoprilate increased superoxide anion production as measured by luminescence ( lucigenin ) and electron spin resonance spectroscopy ( hydroxylamine radical transition ) . Also , both renin and prorenin increased Nox4 expression while Nox2 , p47(phox) , and p67(phox) remained unchanged . In an investigation of the effects of renin and prorenin on fibrosis genes , it appeared that both proteins stimulated transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) , fibronectin , and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) expression and therefore participated to an overall switch toward a profibrotic state of the kidney cells . When the cells were transfected with a siRNA targeting the PRR , Nox4 expression was efficiently prevented as well as the increase in superoxide production , TGF-β , fibronectin , and P05121 . Finally , we demonstrated that transfection of the cells with a Nox4-specific small interfering ( si ) RNA also prevented fibrosis gene expression following treatment with renin or prorenin . The results demonstrate that renin and prorenin , through their specific membrane receptor and independently of angiotensin II , promote fibrosis gene expression via a Nox4-dependent mechanism .
