Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the small GTP-binding protein , Rac , contribute to the effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 on gene expression . The kinases and regulatory proteins that convey signals initiated by transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) to the nucleus are poorly characterized . To study the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) pathway in this process , we transiently transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with TGF-beta-responsive luciferase reporter genes and expression vectors designed to interrupt this kinase cascade . Mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase phosphatase-1 and a dominant negative Q96HU1 / P29323 kinase 1 mutant reduced stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) promoter activity by TGF-beta1 from 11.5- to 4-fold and 4.9-fold , respectively . Similar results were observed with the type I collagen promoters . TGF-beta1 increased P27361 activity 4.5-fold at 5 min and 3 . 1-fold at 3 h , while Jun kinase and p38 activity were not affected . Cotransfection of a dominant negative mutant of the small G protein , Rac , but not dominant negative Ras , Cdc42 , or Rho mutants , reduced the effects of TGF-beta1 on the P05121 promoter by approximately half . In support of a role for Rac in signaling by TGF-beta , GTP binding to Rac was increased 3.7-fold following exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to TGF-beta1 for 3 min . These findings indicate that TGF-beta1 modulates gene expression partly through P29323 and Rac in NIH 3T3 cells .
