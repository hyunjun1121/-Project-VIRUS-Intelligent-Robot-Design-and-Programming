Evidence for a link between histone deacetylation and CaÂ²+ homoeostasis in sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase-deficient fibroblasts . Embryonic fibroblasts from Q14703 ( sphingosine-1-phosphate ) lyase-deficient mice [ Sgpl1-/- MEFs ( mouse embryonic fibroblasts ) ] are characterized by intracellular accumulation of Q14703 , elevated cytosolic [Ca2+]i and enhanced Ca2+ storage . Since Q14703 , produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells , inhibited HDACs ( histone deacetylases ) [ Hait , Allegood , Maceyka , Strub , Harikumar , Singh , Luo , Marmorstein , Kordula , Milstein et al. ( 2009 ) Science 325 , 1254-1257 ] , in the present study we analysed whether Q14703 accumulated in the nuclei of Q14703 lyase-deficient MEFs and caused HDAC inhibition . Interestingly , nuclear concentrations of Q14703 were disproportionally elevated in Sgpl1-/- MEFs . HDAC activity was reduced , acetylation of histone 3-Lys9 was increased and the HDAC-regulated gene P38936 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was up-regulated in these cells . Furthermore , the expression of Q13547 and O15379 was reduced in Sgpl1-/- MEFs . In wild-type MEFs , acetylation of histone 3-Lys9 was increased by the Q14703 lyase inhibitor 4-deoxypyridoxine . The non-specific HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A elevated basal [Ca2+]i and enhanced Ca2+ storage , whereas the Q13547 /2/3 inhibitor DB05651 elevated basal [Ca2+]i without influence on Ca2+ storage in wild-type MEFs . Overexpression of Q13547 or Q92769 reduced the elevated basal [Ca2+]i in Sgpl1-/- MEFs . Taken together , Q14703 lyase-deficiency was associated with elevated nuclear Q14703 levels , reduced HDAC activity and down-regulation of HDAC isoenzymes . The decreased HDAC activity in turn contributed to the dysregulation of Ca2+ homoeostasis , particularly to the elevated basal [Ca2+]i , in Sgpl1-/- MEFs .
