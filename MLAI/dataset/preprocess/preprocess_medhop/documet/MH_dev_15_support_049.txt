Q9Y251 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the progression of oral mucosal melanoma . Oral mucosal melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm with poor prognosis . Q9Y251 is an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase , which cleaves heparan sulphate chains . The vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is the most potent angiogenic mitogen and interaction with its receptor ( VEGFR ) has been associated with angiogenesis . We investigated the expression of these molecules in the progression of oral mucosal melanoma . Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 15 oral melanotic macules and 19 oral melanomas using heparanase , P15692 , P35968 , P28906 and Ki-67 . Microvessel density was determined and subjected to statistical analysis . Q9Y251 and P35968 were not expressed in the oral melanotic macule . Atypical melanocytes and melanoma cells expressed heparanase , P15692 and P35968 . An intense expression was noted in the early invasive phase , which marks the crucial transition from in situ to the invasive phase . In the invasive component , heparanase was intense but selective in the invasive fronts and at the periphery of nests unlike the extensive expression of P15692 and P35968 . However , hot spots were only observed at the periphery of the nests . In conclusion , melanoma cells expressed heparanase , P15692 and P35968 . The coexpression of these molecules in atypical melanocytes and melanoma cells suggests their function in cell migration and invasion . Moreover , the intense expression in the crucial transition from in situ to the invasive phase suggests their role in the progression of the tumor . The role of P15692 and P35968 in angiogenesis was evident only at the periphery of the nests in the invasive components .
