Synteny mapping in the bovine : genes from human chromosome 4 . Genes homologous to those located on human chromosome 4 ( HSA4 ) were mapped in the bovine to determine regions of syntenic conservation among humans , mice , and cattle . Previous studies have shown that two homologs of genes on HSA4 , Q96G03 and P28838 , are located in bovine syntenic group U15 ( chromosome 6 ) . The homologous mouse genes , Pgm-1 and Pep-7 , are on MMU5 . Using a panel of bovine x hamster hybrid somatic cells , we have assigned homologs of 11 additional HSA4 loci to their respective bovine syntenic groups . D4S43 , D4S10 , P09417 , P01591 , P00325 , P10721 , and IF were assigned to syntenic group U15 . This syntenic arrangement is not conserved in the mouse , where D4s43 , D4s10 , Qdpr , and Igj are on MMU5 while Adh-2 is on MMU3 . P60568 , P02675 , P02679 , and P03951 , which also reside on MMU3 , were assigned to bovine syntenic group U23 . These data suggest that breaks and/or fusions of ancestral chromosomes carrying these genes occurred at different places during the evolution of humans , cattle , and mice .
