Androgen receptors in the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis increase neuropeptide expression and the stress-induced activation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus . The posterior bed nuclei of the stria terminalis ( BST ) are important neural substrate for relaying limbic influences to the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) of the hypothalamus to inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis responses to emotional stress . P10275 -expressing cells within the posterior BST have been identified as projecting to the PVN region . To test a role for androgen receptors in the posterior BST to inhibit PVN motor neurons , we compared the effects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) , the androgen receptor antagonist hydroxyflutamide ( HF ) , or a combination of both drugs implanted unilaterally within the posterior BST . Rats bearing unilateral implants were analyzed for PVN Fos induction in response to acute-restraint stress and relative levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) mRNA . DB00142 decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) 65 and Q99259 67 mRNA were analyzed in the posterior BST to test a local involvement of GABA . There were no changes in Q99259 expression to support a GABA-related mechanism in the BST . For PVN neuropeptide expression and Fos responses , basic effects were lateralized to the sides of the PVN ipsilateral to the implants . However , opposite to our expectations of an inhibitory influence of androgen receptors in the posterior BST , PVN AVP mRNA and stress-induced Fos were augmented in response to DB02901 and attenuated in response to HF . These results suggest that a subset of androgen receptor-expressing cells within the posterior BST region may be responsible for increasing the biosynthetic capacity and stress-induced drive of PVN motor neurons .
