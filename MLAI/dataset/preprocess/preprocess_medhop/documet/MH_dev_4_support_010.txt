Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibit atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA transcription in P40189 -mediated hypertrophic ventricular myocytes . OBJECTIVE : To understand the role of P01160 mRNA transcription regulation in P40189 -mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , and the involved mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 , also called Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK ) signaling pathway . METHODS : Isolated neonatal ventricular myocytes were treated with different concentrations of Q16619 ( 10(-9) , 10(-8)and 10(-7)mol/L ) . MTT was used to analyze the viability and RT-PCR was used to detect P01160 mRNA levels in cardiomyocyte . To inhibit Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK activity in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes , the cells were pretreated with a specific Q02750 inhibitor . RESULTS : Q16619 significantly induced P01160 mRNA expression and the viability of cardiomyocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Furthermore , blocking Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK activity by the special Q02750 inhibitor upregulated the P01160 mRNA . CONCLUSIONS : Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK have an important role in suppressing P01160 mRNA transcription and cell activity in P40189 -mediated hypertrophic ventricular myocytes .
