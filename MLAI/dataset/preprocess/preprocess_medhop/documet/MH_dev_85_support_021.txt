DB02901 interacts with P00533 /MAPK signalling and modulates P00533 levels in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells . P10275 ( AR ) signalling plays a pivotal role in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression . However , androgen-mediated AR signalling is yet to be fully understood . P00533 and Q96HU1 kinase signalling pathways play predominant roles in AR function . Therefore , we investigated the interaction of P00533 signalling and AR activity in AR-positive LNCaP cells . We found that 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) and P01133 had a synergistic effect on AR activity as detected by a luciferase reporter system , although P01133 alone did not activate AR . Both P27361 /2 and p38 were involved in DB02901 and DB02901 / P01133 -induced AR activation as detected by specific MEK and p38 inhibitors . Furthermore , 24-h treatment of the cells with DB02901 resulted in ubiquitination and down-regulation of the P00533 . This effect could be inhibited by the anti-androgen flutamide , suggesting an androgen-dependent mechanism . On the other hand , DB02901 -treatment strongly increased AR levels in LNCaP cells . These data suggest a complex regulatory loop between activated AR and P00533 . In conclusion , activation of AR by both DB02901 and P01133 / DB02901 involves the Q96HU1 kinase pathway . Long-term activation of AR results in increase of AR levels , which through so far unknown regulatory mechanisms results in ubiquitination and degradation of the P00533 .
