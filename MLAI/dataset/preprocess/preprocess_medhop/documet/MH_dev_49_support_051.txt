Comparison of imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and INNO-406 in imatinib-resistant cell lines . We compared the growth-inhibitory effects and inhibition profile of the P12931 family kinases ( SFKs ) of imatinib , dasatinib , nilotinib and INNO-406 . Dasatinib exhibited the strongest potency against P11274 - P00519 with little selectivity over SFKs . DB04868 exhibited a weaker affinity than the other inhibitors , but was highly specific for P00519 and may be useful for the treatment of P-glycoprotein overexpressing leukemic cells . INNO-406 had an intermediate affinity for P11274 - P00519 between that of dasatinib and nilotinib , and inhibited only SFKs P06239 and P07948 among SFKs . Both nilotinib and INNO-406 were potent inhibitors of the dasatinib-resistant T315A , F317L and F317V P11274 - P00519 mutations .
