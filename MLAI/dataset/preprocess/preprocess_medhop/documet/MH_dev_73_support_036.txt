Reinforcing and neurochemical effects of cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonists , but not cocaine , are altered by an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist . Several recent studies suggest functional and molecular interactions between striatal adenosine A(2A) and cannabinoid CB(1) receptors . Here , we demonstrate that A(2A) receptors selectively modulate reinforcing effects of cannabinoids . We studied effects of A(2A) receptor blockade on the reinforcing effects of DB00470 ( THC ) and the endogenous CB(1) receptor ligand anandamide under a fixed-ratio schedule of intravenous drug injection in squirrel monkeys . A low dose of the selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist MSX-3 ( 1 mg/kg ) caused downward shifts of THC and anandamide dose-response curves . In contrast , a higher dose of MSX-3 ( 3 mg/kg ) shifted THC and anandamide dose-response curves to the left . MSX-3 did not modify cocaine or food pellet self-administration . Also , MSX-3 neither promoted reinstatement of extinguished drug-seeking behavior nor altered reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior by non-contingent priming injections of THC . Finally , using in vivo microdialysis in freely-moving rats , a behaviorally active dose of MSX-3 significantly counteracted THC-induced , but not cocaine-induced , increases in extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell . The significant and selective results obtained with the lower dose of MSX-3 suggest that adenosine A(2A) antagonists acting preferentially at presynaptic A(2A) receptors might selectively reduce reinforcing effects of cannabinoids that lead to their abuse . However , the appearance of potentiating rather than suppressing effects on cannabinoid reinforcement at the higher dose of MSX-3 would likely preclude the use of such a compound as a medication for cannabis abuse . DB00640 A(2A) antagonists with more selectivity for presynaptic versus postsynaptic receptors could be potential medications for treatment of cannabis abuse .
