Linkage of protein kinase C-beta activation and intracellular interleukin-2 accumulation in human naive P01730 T cells . A critical role for protein kinase C ( PKC ) in signal transduction events has been well established . Moreover , studies of regulation in PKC levels suggest participation in mediating long-term cellular functions . Protein kinase C-beta ( P05771 ) has been reported to be involved in interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) synthesis in T lymphocytes . In this study , the role of P05771 in intracellular accumulation of P60568 was investigated using specific inhibitors . Preincubation with two different PKC inhibitors , one specific for classical isotypes ( alpha and beta I ) Go6976 , and one which inhibits both classical and non-classical isotypes , GF109203X , caused a complete block in cytoplasmic P60568 accumulation when naive P01730 T cells were stimulated in the presence of P06729 + P10747 +phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . In contrast , preincubation with up to 1000 ng/ml of cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) resulted in a reduction in the intracellular P60568 detected , as observed by a decrease in the proportion of positive cells as well as a fall in the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) . DB00091 did not influence P05771 translocation . Flow cytometric assessments of P05771 and its isoforms beta I and beta II correlated with Western blotting analysis and these results were further supported by the use of P05771 -positive ( HUT 78 ) and -negative ( BW5147 ) T-cell lines . Using the specific inhibitors , Go6976 and GF109203X , the findings in this study suggest that activation and translocation of P05771 is critical for accumulation of intracellular P60568 . The influence of DB00091 in reducing but not blocking P60568 synthesis is discussed . PMA-induced down-regulation of the P01730 antigen was observed in the presence of Go6976 and but not GF109203X , suggesting regulation by non-classical PKC isoforms .
