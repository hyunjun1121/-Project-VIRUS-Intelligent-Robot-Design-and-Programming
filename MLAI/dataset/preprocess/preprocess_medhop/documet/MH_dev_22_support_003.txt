Genetic alterations and oncogenic pathways associated with breast cancer subtypes . Breast cancers can be divided into subtypes with important implications for prognosis and treatment . We set out to characterize the genetic alterations observed in different breast cancer subtypes and to identify specific candidate genes and pathways associated with subtype biology . mRNA expression levels of estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and P04626 were shown to predict marker status determined by immunohistochemistry and to be effective at assigning samples to subtypes . P04626 (+) cancers were shown to have the greatest frequency of high-level amplification ( independent of the P04626 amplicon itself ) , but triple-negative cancers had the highest overall frequencies of copy gain . Triple-negative cancers also were shown to have more frequent loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue and mutation of P06400 , which may contribute to genomic instability . We identified and validated seven regions of copy number alteration associated with different subtypes , and used integrative bioinformatics analysis to identify candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors , including P04626 , Q14451 , O95251 , O15297 , P24385 , Q92769 , P55317 , and P20936 . We tested the candidate oncogene O95251 and showed that it enhances the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells . The genome-wide and region-specific differences between subtypes suggest the differential activation of oncogenic pathways .
