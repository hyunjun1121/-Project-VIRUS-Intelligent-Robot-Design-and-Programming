The impact of biological agents interfering with receptor/ligand binding in the immune system . We herein discuss the impact of biological agents based on the ability of monoclonal antibodies to target specific molecules . This approach has given to clinical immunologists a spectrum of drugs able to manipulate the immune system . In the first session , we discuss drugs targeting T-cell function by : ( 1 ) targeting P10747 mediated costimulation ( DB01281 and DB06681 ) ; ( 2 ) interfering with interleukin-2 receptor ( DB00074 and DB00111 ) ; ( 3 ) blocking cell adhesion and homing ( DB00092 , DB00095 , DB00108 ) . The second session is dedicated to drugs targeting cytokines or their receptors . The best known and largely experimented case is represented by drugs targeting tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) ( DB00065 , Adalilumab , Certolizumab ) or its p75 receptor ( DB00005 ) . However , newer products are now available to target other inflammatory cytokines including P05231 , P10145 , IL-12 , P40933 , Q14116 , IL-23 . These agents have the potential to become powerful tools in the control of several immune-mediated diseases , especially auto-immune and inflammatory ones . They traslate into reality the prediction that antibodies will eventually become " magic bullets which seek their own target " ( P. Ehrich , 1906 ) .
