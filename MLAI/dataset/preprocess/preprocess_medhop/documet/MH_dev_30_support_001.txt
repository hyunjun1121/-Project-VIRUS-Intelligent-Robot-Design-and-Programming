Platelets trigger a P25942 -dependent inflammatory response in the microvasculature of inflammatory bowel disease patients . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Platelets circulate in an activated state in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) , but their role in the pathogenesis of Q9UKU7 is unclear . The recent demonstration that activated platelets express P29965 ( L ) provides a mechanism of interaction with P25942 -positive endothelial cells , inducing them to produce proinflammatory mediators . We investigated whether platelets from patients with Q9UKU7 express enhanced levels of P29965 and induce human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells ( HIMEC ) to up-regulate cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression and secrete chemokines . METHODS : P29965 expression was assessed in resting and thrombin-activated platelets by flow cytometry and in mucosal microthrombi by confocal microscopy . Platelet-HIMEC cocultures were used to study P62158 up-regulation , and interleukin ( IL ) -8 and RANTES production by HIMEC . RESULTS : Q9UKU7 platelets expressed significantly higher P29965 levels than those of healthy subjects , and P29965 -positive platelets were detected in Q9UKU7 -involved mucosa . Activated platelets up-regulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 as well as production of interleukin 8 by HIMEC in a P25942 -dependent fashion . High levels of RANTES were present in platelet-HIMEC cocultures and platelets were identified as the source of this chemokine , which mediated T-cell adhesion to HIMEC . CONCLUSIONS : These results show that platelets can actively contribute to mucosal inflammation and represent a previously unrecognized component of Q9UKU7 pathogenesis .
