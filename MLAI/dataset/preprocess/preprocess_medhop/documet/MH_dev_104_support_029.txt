Reconstruction and functional analysis of altered molecular pathways in human atherosclerotic arteries . BACKGROUND : Atherosclerosis affects aorta , coronary , carotid , and iliac arteries most frequently than any other body vessel . There may be common molecular pathways sustaining this process . Plaque presence and diffusion is revealed by circulating factors that can mediate systemic reaction leading to plaque rupture and thrombosis . RESULTS : We used DNA microarrays and meta-analysis to study how the presence of calcified plaque modifies human coronary and carotid gene expression . We identified a series of potential human atherogenic genes that are integrated in functional networks involved in atherosclerosis . Caveolae and JAK/ P35610 pathways , and P06702 / P05109 interacting proteins are certainly involved in the development of vascular disease . We found that the system of caveolae is directly connected with genes that respond to hormone receptors , and indirectly with the apoptosis pathway . Cytokines , chemokines and growth factors released in the blood flux were investigated in parallel . High levels of RANTES , IL-1ra , MIP-1 alpha , MIP-1 beta , P60568 , P05112 , P05113 , P05231 , P13232 , Q16552 , DB00102 , P15692 and P01579 were found in plasma of atherosclerotic patients and might also be integrated in the molecular networks underlying atherosclerotic modifications of these vessels . CONCLUSION : The pattern of cytokine and P06702 / P05109 up-regulation characterizes atherosclerosis as a proinflammatory disorder . Activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway is confirmed by the up-regulation of P05231 , P42224 , Q00978 and Q13651 genes in coronary and carotid plaques . The functional network constructed in our research is an evidence of the central role of P35610 protein and the caveolae system to contribute to preserve the plaque . Moreover , Cav-1 is involved in SMC differentiation and dyslipidemia confirming the importance of lipid homeostasis in the atherosclerotic phenotype .
