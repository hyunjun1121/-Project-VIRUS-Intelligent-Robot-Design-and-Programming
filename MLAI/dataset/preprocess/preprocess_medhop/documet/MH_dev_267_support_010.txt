Antithymocyte globulins suppress dendritic cell function by multiple mechanisms . BACKGROUND : The polyclonal rabbit antithymocyte and anti-T-cell immunoglobulins ( ATGs ) DB00098 ( TG ) and DB05320 ( ATG-F ) have been widely used for the prevention and therapy of allograft rejection and graft versus host disease in transplantation . Although immunosuppressive mechanisms of ATGs on T cells are well studied , less is known about their impact on dendritic cells ( DCs ) . METHODS : Effects of TG and ATG-F on immune functions and signaling pathways of human monocyte-derived DCs were determined by flow cytometry , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , Western blot , apoptosis assays , endocytosis assays , and T cell stimulation assays . RESULTS : TG and ATG-F bind rapidly and with high affinity to CD11c , P33681 , P42081 , P25942 , P16671 , P28907 , CD206 , and human leukocyte antigen-DR on DCs . TG and , to a lesser extent , ATG-F induce apoptosis in immature and mature DCs . Macropinocytotic and receptor-mediated endocytotic antigen uptake in immature DCs is inhibited by TG and ATG-F due to their binding of the C-type lectins CD206 and Q9NNX6 . TG and ATG-F induce activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases P27361 /2 and p38 that contributes to the induction of apoptosis . TG and ATG-F also induce cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB/Rel transcription factors RelB , RelA , p50 , and p52 . Production of interleukin-12p70 in mature DCs is suppressed by TG and ATG-F . TG and ATG-F reduce the capacity of mature DCs to stimulate allogeneic and autologous T cells . CONCLUSIONS : ATGs interfere with basic DC functions , suggesting that DCs are relevant targets for the immunosuppressive action of ATGs in transplantation .
