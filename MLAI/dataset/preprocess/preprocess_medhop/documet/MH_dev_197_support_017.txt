The PEPvIII-KLH ( DB05374 ) vaccine in glioblastoma multiforme patients . Conventional therapies for glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) fail to target tumor cells exclusively , resulting in non-specific toxicity . Immune targeting of tumor-specific mutations may allow for more precise eradication of neoplastic cells . P00533 variant III ( EGFRvIII ) is a tumor-specific mutation that is widely expressed in GBM and other neoplasms and its expression enhances tumorigenicity . This in-frame deletion mutation splits a codon , resulting in a novel glycine at the fusion junction producing a tumor-specific epitope target for cellular or humoral immunotherapy . We have previously shown that vaccination with a peptide that spans the EGFRvIII fusion junction ( PEPvIII-KLH/ DB05374 ) is an efficacious immunotherapy in syngeneic murine models . In this review , we summarize our results in GBM patients targeting this mutation in multiple , multi-institutional Phase II immunotherapy trials . These trials demonstrated that a selected population of GBM patients who received vaccines targeting EGFRvIII had an unexpectedly long survival time . Further therapeutic strategies and potential pitfalls of using this approach are discussed .
