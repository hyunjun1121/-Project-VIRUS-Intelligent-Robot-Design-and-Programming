Regulation of P40763 by histone deacetylase-3 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma : implications for therapy . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) with an activated B-cell ( DB01048 ) gene-expression profile has been shown to have a poorer prognosis compared with tumors with a germinal center B-cell type . ABC cell lines have constitutive activation of P40763 ; however , the mechanisms regulating P40763 signaling in lymphoma are unknown . In studies of class-I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) expression , we found overexpression of O15379 in phospho P40763 -positive DLBCL and the O15379 was found to be complexed with P40763 . Inhibition of HDAC activity by DB06603 ( LBH589 ) increased p300-mediated P40763 (Lys685) acetylation with increased nuclear export of P40763 to the cytoplasm . HDAC inhibition abolished P40763 (Tyr705) phosphorylation with minimal effect on P40763 (Ser727) and O60674 tyrosine activity . pSTAT3(Tyr705)-positive DLBCLs were more sensitive to HDAC inhibition with LBH589 compared with pSTAT3(Tyr705)-negative DLBCLs . This cytotoxicity was associated with downregulation of the direct P40763 target Mcl-1 . O15379 knockdown upregulated P40763 (Lys685) acetylation but prevented P40763 (Tyr705) phosphorylation and inhibited survival of pSTAT3-positive DLBCL cells . These studies provide the rationale for targeting P40763 -positive DLBCL tumors with HDAC inhibitors .
