Unprecedented acetoacetyl-coenzyme A synthesizing enzyme of the thiolase superfamily involved in the mevalonate pathway . Acetoacetyl- DB01992 is the precursor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl ( HMG ) - DB01992 in the mevalonate pathway , which is essential for terpenoid backbone biosynthesis . Acetoacetyl- DB01992 is also the precursor of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate , a polymer belonging to the polyester class produced by microorganisms . The de novo synthesis of acetoacetyl- DB01992 is usually catalyzed by acetoacetyl- DB01992 thiolase via a thioester-dependent Claisen condensation reaction between two molecules of acetyl- DB01992 . Here , we report that nphT7 , found in the mevalonate pathway gene cluster from a soil-isolated Streptomyces sp. strain , encodes an unusual acetoacetyl- DB01992 synthesizing enzyme . The recombinant enzyme overexpressed in Escherichia coli catalyzes a single condensation of acetyl- DB01992 and malonyl- DB01992 to give acetoacetyl- DB01992 and DB01992 . Replacement of malonyl- DB01992 with malonyl- ( acyl carrier protein ) resulted in loss of the condensation activity . No acetoacetyl- DB01992 synthesizing activity was detected through the condensation of two molecules of acetyl- DB01992 . Based on these properties of NphT7 , we propose to name this unusual enzyme of the thiolase superfamily acetoacetyl- Q13057 . Coexpression of nphT7 with the HMG- Q13057 gene and the P04035 gene in a heterologous host allowed 3.5-fold higher production of mevalonate than when only the HMG- Q13057 and P04035 genes were expressed . This result suggests that nphT7 can be used to significantly increase the concentration of acetoacetyl- DB01992 in cells , eventually leading to the production of useful terpenoids and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate .
