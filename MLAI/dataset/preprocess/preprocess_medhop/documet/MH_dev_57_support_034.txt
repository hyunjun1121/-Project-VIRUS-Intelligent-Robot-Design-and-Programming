Chenodeoxycholic acid attenuates ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation in murine model of asthma by inhibiting the T(H)2 cytokines . Asthma is a complex highly prevalent airway disease that is a major public health problem for which current treatment options are inadequate . Recently , farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory actions in various disease conditions , but there have been no reported investigations of Chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , a natural Q96RI1 agonist , in allergic airway inflammation . To test the DB06777 effectiveness in airway inflammation , ovalbumin ( OVA ) -induced acute murine asthma model was established . We found that lung tissue express Q96RI1 and DB06777 administration reduced the severity of the murine allergic airway disease as assessed by pathological and molecular markers associated with the disease . DB06777 treatment resulted in fewer infiltrations of cells into the airspace and peribronchial areas , and decreased goblet cell hyperplasia , mucus secretion and serum IgE levels which was increased in mice with OVA-induced allergic asthma . The DB06777 treatment further blocked the secretion of TH2 cytokines ( P05112 , P05113 and P35225 ) and proinflammatory cytokine P01375 -Î± indicate that the Q96RI1 and its agonists may have potential for treating allergic asthma .
