Dual P00533 and P42345 targeting in squamous cell carcinoma models , and development of early markers of efficacy . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a validated target in squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck . Most patients , however , do not respond or develop resistance to this agent . P42345 ( P42345 ) is involved in the pathogenesis of SCC of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) . This study aimed to determine if targeting P42345 in combination with P00533 is effective in SCC , and to develop early pharmacodynamic markers of efficacy . Two SCC cell lines , one resistant ( HEP2 ) and one of intermediate susceptibility ( Detroit 562 ) to P00533 inhibitors , were xenografted in vivo and treated with an P42345 inhibitor ( temsirolimus ) , an P00533 inhibitor ( erlotinib ) or a combination of both . DB06287 exerted superior growth arrest in both cell lines than erlotinib . The combined treatment resulted in synergistic antitumor effects in the Detroit 562 cell line . Immunohistochemical assessment of pharmacodynamic effects in fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsies early after treatment using phospho MAPK , Phospho-P70 and Ki67 as end points demonstrated pathway abrogation in the Detroit 562 tumours treated with the combination , the only group where regressions were seen . In conclusion , an P42345 inhibitor showed antitumor activity in P00533 -resistant SCC cell lines . Marked antitumor effects were associated with dual pathway inhibition , which were detected by early FNA biopsies .
