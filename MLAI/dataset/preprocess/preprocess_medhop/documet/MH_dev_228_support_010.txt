Neuropeptide Y expression , localization and cellular transducing effects in HUVEC . BACKGROUND INFORMATION : P01303 ( neuropeptide Y ) may have an effect on the properties of vascular endothelial cells such as pro-angiogenic effects and potentiation of noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction . In HUVEC ( human umbilical-vein endothelial cells ) , immunoreactive neuropeptide Y has been detected , but P01303 synthesis , storage and secretion have not been studied . The aim of the present study was to establish P01303 expression , storage and cellular transducing effects in HUVEC . RESULTS : HUVEC contain 0.19 fmol of P01303 /microg of protein and 0.46 fmol of pro- P01303 /microg of protein , as measured by ELISA . RT ( reverse transcriptase ) -PCR confirmed the expression of P01303 in HUVEC . Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of P01303 in small punctate structures , with a fluorescence pattern different from that observed for P04275 , indicating distinct storage compartments . Double labelling for P01303 and Rab3A demonstrated similar granular patterns , with at least partial co-localization . Electron microscopy showed P01303 immunoreactivity in vesicle-like cytoplasmic structures , of a fine fibrillar texture , as well as in mitochondria and in the nucleus . A similar general distribution pattern was also obtained for Rab3A . Q03519 and P28062 receptors were expressed in HUVEC as assessed by RT-PCR , and they were functional since P01303 induced a 42 nM intracellular calcium increase within 100 s , representing 22 % of the histamine-induced response . In contrast with histamine , P01303 did not induce acute P04275 secretion . CONCLUSIONS : HUVEC produce , store and respond to P01303 , suggesting an autocrine regulatory role for P01303 in the endothelium .
