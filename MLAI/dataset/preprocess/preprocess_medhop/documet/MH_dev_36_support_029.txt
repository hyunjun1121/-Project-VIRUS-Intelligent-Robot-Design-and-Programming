Effects of metoclopramide and tropisetron on aldosterone secretion possibly due to agonism and antagonism at the Q13639 receptor . OBJECTIVE : Part of the prokinetic activity of metoclopramide can possibly be ascribed to agonist activity at Q13639 receptors . The 5- Q9H205 antagonist tropisetron is thought to act as an antagonist at Q13639 receptors . In the present study aldosterone secretion in response to the administration of these two drugs was explored to examine the role of the Q13639 receptor in aldosterone secretion . METHODS : Following a single-blind , random design , ten normal male volunteers received one of the following regimens on three occasions , with at least 2-week intervals : metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. ; tropisetron 5 mg by slow i.v.i. , or ; tropisetron by slow i.v.i. , followed by 10 mg metoclopramide i.v. RESULTS : In response to metoclopramide alone the mean plasma aldosterone level rose significantly to 149 % of basal level and remained significantly elevated for the next 20 min . With tropisetron alone , there was a significant 37.8 % drop at 60 min and the aldosterone levels remained low for the duration of the experiment . DB01233 reversed the decline mediated by tropisetron significantly at 30 and 90 min . DB04630 levels after the latter regimen also did not differ significantly from baseline at any time period . CONCLUSION : These results would suggest the existence of a tonic stimulatory influence of 5-HT via Q13639 receptors on aldosterone secretion , which could be augmented by metoclopramide and blocked by tropisetron . However , the effect of tropisetron per se should be interpreted with caution given the lack of a saline group .
