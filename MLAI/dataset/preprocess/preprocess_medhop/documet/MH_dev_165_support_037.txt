Immunohistochemical expression of P12830 does not distinguish canine cutaneous histiocytoma from other canine round cell tumors . Immunohistochemistry for P12830 ( ECAD ) has been used to distinguish canine cutaneous histiocytoma from other leukocytic neoplasms ( " round cell tumors " ) . To determine the specificity of this test , 5 types of canine cutaneous round cell tumors were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of ECAD . Tumors of all 5 types had variable cytoplasmic , plasma membrane , and/or paranuclear ECAD expression : All 13 cutaneous histiocytomas were ECAD+ ; all but 1 of 14 mast cell tumors expressed ECAD ; 10 of 12 epitheliotropic lymphomas reacted with P12830 antibody ; of 72 plasmacytomas , 54 were ECAD+ ; and 5 of 5 histiocytic sarcomas were positive . Conclusions based on these results include the following : First , immunoreactivity for ECAD is not limited to leukocytes of cutaneous histiocytoma ; second , antibody to ECAD also labels neoplastic cells in most mast cell tumors , plasmacytomas , cutaneous histiocytic sarcomas , and epitheliotropic lymphomas ; third , although most histiocytomas have membranous ECAD expression , the immunoreactivity varies among round cell tumors and is frequently concurrent in different cellular compartments ; fourth , the distinctively paranuclear ECAD expression pattern in epitheliotropic lymphomas might distinguish them from other round cell tumors ; and , fifth , ECAD should be used with other markers ( eg , MUM1 for plasmacytomas , P10721 for mast cell tumors , CD3 and CD79a for lymphomas ) to distinguish among canine round cell tumors .
