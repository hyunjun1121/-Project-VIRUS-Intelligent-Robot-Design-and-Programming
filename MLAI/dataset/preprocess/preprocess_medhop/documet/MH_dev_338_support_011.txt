DB00796 inhibits Toll-like receptor expression and activity both in vitro and in vivo . INTRODUCTION : Toll-like receptors play an important role in the innate immune system and are found to be crucial in severe diseases like sepsis , atherosclerosis , and arthritis . O60603 and O00206 expression is upregulated in the inflammatory diseases . Angiotensin II in addition to stimulating vasoconstriction also induces an increase in ROS and a proinflammatory phenotype via AT(1)R . P30556 blocker ( ARB ) , widely used as an antihypertensive drug , has been reported to also have anti-inflammatory effects . Thus , we investigated whether an ARB exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting O60603 and O00206 expression . METHODS AND RESULTS : Monocytes were isolated from healthy human volunteers and treated with the synthetic lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 or LPS in the absence or presence of candesartan . Pretreatment of human monocytes with candesartan significantly decreased Pam3CSK4 or LPS induced O60603 and O00206 expression of both mRNA and protein levels ( P < 0.05 vs. control ) along with decrease in the activity of NF-kappaB and the expression of IL-1beta , P05231 , P01375 , and P13500 . Furthermore , candesartan treated mice show decreased O60603 and O00206 expression compared to vehicle control mice . CONCLUSION : Pam3CSK4 and LPS induced O60603 and O00206 expression at mRNA and protein levels are inhibited by candesartan both in vitro and in vivo . Thus , we define a novel pathway by which candesartan could induce anti-inflammatory effects .
