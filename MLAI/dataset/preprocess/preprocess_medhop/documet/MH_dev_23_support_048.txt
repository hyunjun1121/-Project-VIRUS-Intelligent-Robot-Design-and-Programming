A common haplotype of the nicotine acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene is associated with vulnerability to nicotine addiction in men . DB00184 is the major addictive substance in cigarettes , and genes involved in sensing nicotine are logical candidates for vulnerability to nicotine addiction . We studied six single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the P43681 gene and four SNPs in the P17787 gene with respect to nicotine dependence in a collection of 901 subjects ( 815 siblings and 86 parents ) from 222 nuclear families with multiple nicotine-addicted siblings . The subjects were assessed for addiction by both the Fagerstrom Test for DB00184 Dependence ( FTND ) and the Revised Tolerance Questionnaire ( RTQ ) . Because only 5.8 % of female offspring were smokers , only male subjects were included in the final analyses ( 621 men from 206 families ) . Univariate ( single-marker ) family-based association tests ( FBATs ) demonstrated that variant alleles at two SNPs , rs1044396 and rs1044397 , in exon 5 of the P43681 gene were significantly associated with a protective effect against nicotine addiction as either a dichotomized trait or a quantitative phenotype ( i.e. , age-adjusted FTND and RTQ scores ) , which was consistent with the results of the global haplotype FBAT . Furthermore , the haplotype-specific FBAT showed a common ( 22.5 % ) P43681 haplotype , GCTATA , which was significantly associated with both a protective effect against nicotine addiction as a dichotomized trait ( Z=-3.04 , P < .005 ) and significant decreases of age-adjusted FTND ( Z=-3.31 , P < .005 ) or RTQ scores ( Z=-2.73 , P=.006 ) . Our findings provide strong evidence suggesting a common P43681 haplotype might be protective against vulnerability to nicotine addiction in men .
