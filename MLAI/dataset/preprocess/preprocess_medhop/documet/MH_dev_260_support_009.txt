Enhanced uridine adenosine tetraphosphate-induced contraction in renal artery from type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats due to activated cyclooxygenase/thromboxane receptor axis . The dinucleotide uridine adenosine tetraphosphate ( Up4A ) , which has both purine and pyrimidine moieties , was reported as a novel endothelium-derived contracting factor . Recently , growing evidence has suggested that Up4A plays an important role in regulation of the cardiovascular function . We previously demonstrated that Up4A-induced vasoconstrictions are altered in arteries from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats . We have assessed responses to Up4A shown by renal arteries from type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki ( GK ) rats ( 42-46 weeks old ) and identified the molecular mechanisms involved . Concentration-dependent contractions to Up4A were greater in renal arterial rings from the GK than age-matched control Wistar group . In both groups , the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase ( with N ( G ) -nitro-L-arginine ) increased the response to Up4A , whereas the inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) ( with indomethacin ) decreased the response . Specific inhibitors of P23219 ( valeroyl salicylate ) and P35354 ( NS398 ) , a thromboxane ( TX ) receptor ( TP ) antagonist ( SQ29548 ) , and P2 receptor antagonist ( suramin ) also decreased the response to Up4A . Protein expressions of COXs in renal arteries were greater in the GK than Wistar group . The production of TXB2 ( a metabolite of TXA2 ) by Up4A did not differ between these groups . Concentration-dependent contractions to U46619 , an agonist of the TP receptor , were greater in renal arteries from the GK than Wistar group . The expression of P51575 and P41231 receptors did not differ between these groups . These results suggest that enhancement of the Up4A-induced contraction in renal arteries from GK rats may be attributable to the increased activation of COXs/TP receptor signaling .
