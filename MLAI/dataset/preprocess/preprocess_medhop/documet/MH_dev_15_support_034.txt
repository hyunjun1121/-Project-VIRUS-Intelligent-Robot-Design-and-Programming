A recombinant single-chain P13232 /HGFbeta hybrid cytokine induces juxtacrine interactions of the P13232 and P14210 ( c- DB00134 ) receptors and stimulates the proliferation of CFU- P28222 , CLPs , and pre-pro-B cells . A novel recombinant interleukin-7/hepatocyte growth factor beta-chain ( P13232 /HGFbeta ) hybrid cytokine was constructed as a single chain ( sc ) composed of P13232 and HGFbeta connected by a flexible linker . Unlike recombinant ( r ) P13232 , which stimulated pro-B cells and pre-B cells only , scIL-7/HGFbeta stimulated the proliferation of pre-pro-B cells , common lymphoid progenitors ( CLPs ) , and colony-forming unit ( CFU ) - P28222 in cultures of P13232 -/- mouse BM cells . When injected in vivo , 3- to 4-fold more splenic B-lineage cells appeared in recipients of bone marrow ( BM ) cells from the scIL-7/HGFbeta-stimulated cultures than from rIL-7-stimulated cultures . Moreover , on a per-cell basis , scIL-7/HGFbeta culture-generated cells produced 16- to 20-fold more BM and splenic B-lineage cells than did normal BM cells . Antibody blocking , receptor phosphorylation , and confocal microscopy demonstrated that scIL-7/HGFbeta signals though both the P13232 and P14210 ( c- DB00134 ) receptors , which form IL-7R/c- DB00134 complexes on the surface of CLPs and pre-pro-B cells . In addition , the IL-7Ralpha chain , gammac chain , and c- DB00134 were coisolated from purified CLPs and pre-pro-B cells on scIL-7/HGFbeta affinity gels , indicating that they are major components of the P13232 /HGFbeta receptor . Hence , the present results demonstrate that the P13232 /HGFbeta hybrid cytokine efficiently and selectively stimulates the most primitive B-lineage precursors in BM by inducing juxtacrine interactions between the P13232 and c- DB00134 receptors .
