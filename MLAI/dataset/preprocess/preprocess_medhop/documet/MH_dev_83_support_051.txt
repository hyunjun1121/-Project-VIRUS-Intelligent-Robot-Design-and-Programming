[ A pop-up menu linked to a computerized drug prescribing system. Prescribing pattern 's feedback via a simple and quick method ] . It takes time for a GP to acquire sufficient experience of a new drug to be able to prescribe competently . This article describes a project studying the use of computerized records to afford a group of GP 's swift feedback on recently introduced drugs of special interest . In the south-east of Sweden a network of primary health care centers has been created in two neighboring counties . The pharmacies of the region are also taking part . When new drugs of particular interest are introduced , each participating GP will automatically see a pop-up menu , asking questions pertaining to each computer-assisted prescription . In the pharmacies , patients are given a questionnaire regarding their expectations with respect to the drug . In this way it will be possible to provide the individual GP swift feedback from a large number of colleagues and patients concerning the drug 's effectiveness in clinical practice . We have now been studying the P35354 inhibitors rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) . Results show that a pop-up menu used in this way provides the general practitioner quick feed-back on prescribing behavior as well as drug effectiveness in clinical practice .
