Combined treatment with a P56817 inhibitor and anti-Aβ antibody gantenerumab enhances amyloid reduction in APPLondon mice . Therapeutic approaches for prevention or reduction of amyloidosis are currently a main objective in basic and clinical research on Alzheimer 's disease . Among the agents explored in clinical trials are anti-Aβ peptide antibodies and secretase inhibitors . Most anti-Aβ antibodies are considered to act via inhibition of amyloidosis and enhanced clearance of existing amyloid , although secretase inhibitors reduce the de novo production of Aβ . Limited information is currently available on the efficacy and potential advantages of combinatorial antiamyloid treatment . We performed a chronic study in APPLondon transgenic mice that received treatment with anti-Aβ antibody gantenerumab and P56817 inhibitor RO5508887 , either as mono- or combination treatment . Treatment aimed to evaluate efficacy on amyloid progression , similar to preexisting amyloidosis as present in Alzheimer 's disease patients . Mono-treatments with either compound caused a dose-dependent reduction of total brain Aβ and amyloid burden . Combination treatment with both compounds significantly enhanced the antiamyloid effect . The observed combination effect was most pronounced for lowering of amyloid plaque load and plaque number , which suggests effective inhibition of de novo plaque formation . Moreover , significantly enhanced clearance of pre-existing amyloid plaques was observed when gantenerumab was coadministered with RO5508887 . P56817 inhibition led to a significant time- and dose-dependent decrease in P04141 Aβ , which was not observed for gantenerumab treatment . Our results demonstrate that combining these two antiamyloid agents enhances overall efficacy and suggests that combination treatments may be of clinical relevance .
