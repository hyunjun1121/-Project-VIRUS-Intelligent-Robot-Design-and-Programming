Binding of human plasminogen to basement-membrane ( type IV ) collagen . P00747 , the zymogen form of the serine proteinase plasmin , has been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes involving extracellular-matrix remodelling . We have previously demonstrated that the activation of plasminogen catalysed by tissue plasminogen activator is dramatically stimulated in the presence of basement-membrane-specific type IV collagen [ Stack , Gonzalez-Gronow & Pizzo ( 1990 ) Biochemistry 29 , 4966-4970 ] . The present paper describes the binding of plasminogen to type IV collagen . P00747 binds to both the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains of basement-membrane collagen , with binding to the alpha 2(IV) chain preferentially inhibited by DB00513 . This binding is specific and saturable , with Kd,app. values of 11.5 and 12.7 nM for collagen and gelatin respectively . Although collagen also binds to immobilized plasminogen , this interaction is unaffected by DB00513 . Limited elastase proteolysis of plasminogen generated distinct collagen-binding fragments , which were identified as the kringle 1-3 and kringle 4 domains . No binding of collagen to mini-plasminogen was observed . These studies demonstrate a specific interaction between plasminogen and type IV collagen and provide further evidence for regulation of plasminogen activation by protein components of the extracellular matrix .
