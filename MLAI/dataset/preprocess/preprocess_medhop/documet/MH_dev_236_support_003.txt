Effective antibody therapy induces host-protective antitumor immunity that is augmented by O00206 agonist treatment . Toll-like receptors are potent activators of the innate immune system and generate signals leading to the initiation of the adaptive immune response that can be utilized for therapeutic purposes . We tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with a Toll-like receptor agonist and an antitumor monoclonal antibody is effective and induces host-protective antitumor immunity . C57BL/6 human mutated P04626 ( hmHER2 ) transgenic mice that constitutively express kinase-deficient human P04626 under control of the CMV promoter were established . These mice demonstrate immunological tolerance to D5- P04626 , a syngeneic human P04626 -expressing melanoma cell line . This human P04626 -tolerant model offers the potential to serve as a preclinical model to test both antibody therapy and the immunization potential of human P04626 -targeted therapeutics . Here , we show that E6020 , a Toll-like receptor-4 ( O00206 ) agonist effectively boosted the antitumor efficacy of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in immunodeficient C57BL/6 SCID mice as well as in C57BL/6 hmHER2 transgenic mice . E6020 and trastuzumab co-treatment resulted in significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth than was observed with either agent individually . Furthermore , mice treated with the combination of trastuzumab and the O00206 agonist were protected against rechallenge with human P04626 -transfected tumor cells in hmHER2 transgenic mouse strains . These findings suggest that combined treatment with trastuzumab and a O00206 agonist not only promotes direct antitumor effects but also induces a host-protective human P04626 -directed adaptive immune response , indicative of a memory response . These data provide an immunological rationale for testing O00206 agonists in combination with antibody therapy in patients with cancer .
