Preferred therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : This report reviews the current treatment strategies and the most recent clinical trials in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . RECENT FINDINGS : The functional and anatomic outcomes achieved in the pivotal ranibizumab trials with monthly injections set the standard for comparison . Since then , various modified dosing regimens with the aim of lessening the treatment burden associated with monthly injections have been investigated . Additionally , level I evidence now exists for the noninferiority of bevacizumab , as compared to ranibizumab , in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) through 1 year of follow-up . DB08885 has emerged as a new anti- vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) therapy showing encouraging treatment results at 1 year . Novel treatments combined with anti- P15692 agents such as localized radiation are currently being investigated . SUMMARY : Anti- P15692 monotherapy remains the preferred therapy for the management of neovascular AMD at the present time . DB08885 is a new , FDA-approved , effective , anti- P15692 agent available for clinical use . Ongoing clinical trials will help determine the optimal dosing regimens for all of these agents , as well as the long-term efficacy and safety of combination therapy modalities .
