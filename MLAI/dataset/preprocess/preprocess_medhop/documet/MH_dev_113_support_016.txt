Potentiator ivacaftor abrogates pharmacological correction of ΔF508 P13569 in cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Newly developed " correctors " such as DB09280 ( VX-809 ) that improve P13569 maturation and trafficking and " potentiators " such as ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) that enhance channel activity may provide important advances in CF therapy . Although VX-770 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in the small subset of patients with a mutation ( G551D ) that affects only channel activity , a single compound is not sufficient to treat patients with the more common P13569 mutation , ΔF508 . Thus , patients with ΔF508 will likely require treatment with both correctors and potentiators to achieve clinical benefit . However , whereas the effectiveness of acute treatment with this drug combination has been demonstrated in vitro , the impact of chronic therapy has not been established . In studies of human primary airway epithelial cells , we found that both acute and chronic treatment with VX-770 improved P13569 function in cells with the G551D mutation , consistent with clinical studies . In contrast , chronic VX-770 administration caused a dose-dependent reversal of VX-809-mediated P13569 correction in ΔF508 homozygous cultures . This result reflected the destabilization of corrected ΔF508 P13569 by VX-770 , markedly increasing its turnover rate . Chronic VX-770 treatment also reduced mature wild-type P13569 levels and function . These findings demonstrate that chronic treatment with P13569 potentiators and correctors may have unexpected effects that can not be predicted from short-term studies . Combining these drugs to maximize rescue of ΔF508 P13569 may require changes in dosing and/or development of new potentiator compounds that do not interfere with P13569 stability .
