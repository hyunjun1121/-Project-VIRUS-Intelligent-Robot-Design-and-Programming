An association between P23921 haplotype and gemcitabine-induced neutropenia in breast cancer patients . PURPOSE : We examined the pattern of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of gemcitabine metabolism-related and target genes in breast cancer patients and evaluated their association with drug response or toxicity . PATIENTS AND METHODS : SNPs in deoxycytidine kinase ( P27707 ) , deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase ( P32321 ) , and ribonucleotide reductase M1 polypeptide ( P23921 ) were analyzed with genomic DNA of 10 breast cancer cell lines , 74 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) samples from advanced breast cancer patients treated with gemcitabine , and 56 PBMC samples from healthy volunteers . RESULTS : The incidences of SNPs of breast cancer patients were 1.4 % in P27707 ( 626 A > G ) , 10.8 % in P32321 ( 315 T > C ) , 40.5 % in the first P23921 ( 1082 C > A ) , 44.6 % in the second P23921 ( 2455 A > G ) , 44.6 % in the third P23921 ( 2464 G > A ) , and 23 % in two P23921 sites ( 2455 A > G and 2464 G > A ) that were similar to those of the normal control group . We found a double SNP of P23921 ( 2455 A > G and 2464 G > A ) to be the novel haplotype that was associated with a lower frequency of chemotherapy-induced toxicity , such as neutropenia ( p < .01 ) and G- P04141 requirement ( p < .005 ) . CONCLUSION : P23921 haplotype showed an association with susceptibility to gemcitabine monotherapy in breast cancer patients .
