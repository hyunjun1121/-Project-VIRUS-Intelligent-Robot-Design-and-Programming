Sorting nexin 5 and dopamine d1 receptor regulate the expression of the insulin receptor in human renal proximal tubule cells . Sorting nexin 5 ( Q9Y5X3 ) belongs to the P20073 family , which is composed of a diverse group of proteins that mediate trafficking of plasma membrane proteins , receptors , and transporters . Q9Y5X3 is important in the resensitization of the dopamine D1-like receptor ( D1R ) . D1R is uncoupled from its effector proteins in hypertension and diabetes , and treatment of diabetes restores D1R function and insulin receptor ( IR ) expression . We tested the hypothesis that the D1R and Q9Y5X3 regulate IR by studying the expression , distribution , dynamics , and functional consequences of their interaction in human renal proximal tubule cells ( hRPTCs ) . D1R , Q9Y5X3 , and IR were expressed and colocalized in the brush border of RPTs . P01308 promoted the colocalization of Q9Y5X3 and IR at the perinuclear area of hRPTCs . Unlike Q9Y5X3 , the D1R colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with IR , and this interaction was enhanced by insulin . To evaluate the role of Q9Y5X3 and D1R on IR signaling , we silenced via RNA interference the endogenous expression of Q9Y5X3 or the D1R gene P21728 in hRPTCs . We observed a decrease in IR expression and abundance of phosphorylated IR substrate and phosphorylated protein kinase B , which are crucial components of the IR signal transduction pathway . Our data indicate that Q9Y5X3 and D1R are necessary for normal IR expression and activity . It is conceivable that D1R and Q9Y5X3 may interact to increase the sensitivity to insulin via a positive regulation of IR and insulin signaling .
