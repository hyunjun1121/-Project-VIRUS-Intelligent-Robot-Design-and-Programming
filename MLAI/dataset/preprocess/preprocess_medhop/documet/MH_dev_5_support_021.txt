DB00067 triggers senescence in K-ras transformed cells via RhoA-dependent downregulation of cyclin D1 . DB00067 ( AVP ) , a vasoactive peptide hormone that binds to three G-protein coupled receptors ( V1R , P30518 , and V3R ) , has long been known to activate V1R and elicit mitogenesis in several cell types , including adrenal glomerulosa cells . However , in the mouse Q03519 adrenocortical malignant cell line , AVP triggers not only a canonical mitogenic response but also novel RhoA-GTP-dependent mechanisms which downregulate cyclin D1 , irreversibly inhibiting K-ras oncogene-driven proliferation . In Q03519 cells , AVP blocks cyclin D1 expression , induces senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SAbeta-Gal ) and inhibits proliferation . However , ectopic expression of cyclin D1 renders Q03519 cells resistant to both SAbeta-Gal induction and proliferation inhibition by AVP . In addition , ectopic expression of the dominant negative RhoAN19 mutant blocks RhoA activation , yielding Q03519 cell sub-lines which are no longer susceptible to cyclin D1 downregulation , SAbeta-Gal induction , or proliferation inhibition by AVP . Furthermore , inhibiting RhoA with P01024 exoenzyme protects Q03519 cells from AVP proliferation inhibition and SAbeta-Gal induction . On the other hand , AVP treatment does not activate caspases 3 and 7 , and the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CMK does not protect Q03519 cells from proliferation inhibition by AVP , implying that AVP does not trigger apoptosis . These results underline a pivotal survival activity of cyclin D1 that protects K-ras oncogene-dependent malignant cells from senescence .
