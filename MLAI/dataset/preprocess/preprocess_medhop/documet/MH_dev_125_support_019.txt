DB01017 improves functional outcomes , memory deficits , and histopathology after endovascular perforation-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats . Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( Q53FZ2 ) results in significant long-lasting cognitive dysfunction . Therefore , evaluating acute and long-term outcomes after therapeutic intervention is important for clinical translation . The aim of this study was to use minocycline , a known neuroprotectant agent , to evaluate the long-term benefits in terms of neurobehavior and neuropathology after experimental Q53FZ2 in rats , and to determine which neurobehavioral test would be effective for long-term evaluation . Q53FZ2 was induced by endovascular perforation in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n=118 ) . The animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of minocycline ( 45 mg/kg or 135 mg/kg ) or vehicle 1 h after Q53FZ2 induction . In the short-term , animals were euthanized at 24 and 72 h for evaluation of neurobehavior , brain water content , and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity . In the long-term , neurobehavior was evaluated at days 21-28 post- Q53FZ2 , and histopathological analysis was done at day 28 . High-dose but not low-dose minocycline reduced brain water content at 24 h , and therefore only the high-dose regimen was used for further evaluation , which reduced P14780 activity at 24 h . Further , high-dose minocycline improved spatial memory and attenuated neuronal loss in the hippocampus and cortex . The rotarod , T-maze , and water maze tests , but not the inclined plane test , detected neurobehavioral deficits in Q53FZ2 rats at days 21-28 . This study demonstrates that minocycline attenuates long-term functional and morphological outcomes after endovascular perforation-induced Q53FZ2 . Long-term neurobehavioral assessments using the rotarod , T-maze , and water maze tests could be useful to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic intervention after experimental Q53FZ2 .
