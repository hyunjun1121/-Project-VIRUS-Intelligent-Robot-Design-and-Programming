Reduction of human monocytic cell neurotoxicity and cytokine secretion by ligands of the cannabinoid-type CB2 receptor . 1 Two cannabinoid receptors , P21554 and CB2 , have been identified . The P21554 receptor is preferentially expressed in brain , and the CB2 receptor in cells of leukocyte lineage . We identified the mRNA for the P21554 receptor in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells , and the mRNA and protein for the CB2 receptor in human microglia and THP-1 cells . 2 Delta(9)-and Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) were toxic when added directly to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells . The toxicity of Delta(9)- THC was inhibited by the P21554 receptor antagonist SR141716A but not by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 . The endogenous ligand anandamide was also toxic , and this toxicity was enhanced by inhibitors of its enzymatic hydrolysis . 3 The selective CB2 receptor ligands JWH-015 and indomethacin morpholinylamide ( BML-190 ) , when added to THP-1 cells before stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and P01579 , reduced the toxicity of their culture supernatants to SH-SY5Y cells . JWH-015 was more effective against neurotoxicity of human microglia than THP-1 cells . The antineurotoxic activity of JWH-015 was blocked by the selective CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 , but not by the P21554 receptor antagonist SR141716A . This activity of JWH-015 was synergistic with that of the P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) inhibitor REV 5901 . 4 Cannabinoids inhibited secretion of IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) by stimulated THP-1 cells , but these effects could not be directly correlated with their antineurotoxic activity . 5 Specific CB2 receptor ligands could be useful anti-inflammatory agents , while avoiding the neurotoxic and psychoactive effects of P21554 receptor ligands such as Delta(9)-THC .
