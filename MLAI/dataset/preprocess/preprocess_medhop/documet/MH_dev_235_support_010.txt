Gating properties of Q14524 mutations and the response to mexiletine in long-QT syndrome type 3 patients . BACKGROUND : DB00379 ( Mex ) has been proposed as a gene-specific therapy for patients with long-QT syndrome type 3 ( LQT3 ) caused by mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene ( Q14524 ) . The degree of QT shortening and the protection from arrhythmias vary among patients harboring different mutations . We tested whether the clinical response to Mex in LQT3 could be predicted by the biophysical properties of the different mutations . METHODS AND RESULTS : We identified 4 Q14524 mutations in 5 symptomatic LQT3 patients with different responses to Mex ( 6 to 8 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) ) . We classified the mutations as sensitive to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ; >/= 10 % of QTc shortening and QTc < 500 ms or no arrhythmias ) or insensitive to Mex ( S941N , M1652R ; negligible or no QTc shortening and sudden death ) . We measured Na(+) current from P29320 293 cells transfected with wild-type ( WT ) or mutant Nav1.5 . All mutations showed impaired inactivation of Na(+) current , but the mutations identified in patient responders to Mex ( P1332L , R1626P ) showed a hyperpolarizing shift of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation . Furthermore , Mex produced use-dependent block with the order R1626P=P1332L > S941N=WT > M1652R , suggesting that Mex-sensitive mutants present prolonged recovery from Mex block . CONCLUSIONS : We propose that voltage dependence of channel availability and shifts of V(1/2) of steady-state inactivation correlate with the clinical response observed in LQT3 patients . This supports the view that the response to Mex is mutation specific and that in vitro testing may help to predict the response to therapy in LQT3 .
