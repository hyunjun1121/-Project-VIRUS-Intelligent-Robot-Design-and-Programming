c-Jun N-terminal kinase and Akt signalling pathways regulating tumour necrosis factor-α-induced interleukin-32 expression in human lung fibroblasts : implications in airway inflammation . Airway inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) and asthma are associated with elevated expression of interleukin-32 ( P24001 ) , a recently described cytokine that appears to play a critical role in inflammation . However , so far , the regulation of pulmonary P24001 production has not been fully established . We examined the expression of P24001 by tumour necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) in primary human lung fibroblasts . Human lung fibroblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of P01375 -α and/or other cytokines/Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) ligands or various signalling molecule inhibitors to analyse the expression of P24001 by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA . Next , activation of Akt and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signalling pathways was investigated by Western blot . P24001 mRNA of four spliced isoforms ( α , β , γ and δ ) was up-regulated upon P01375 -α stimulation , which was associated with a significant P24001 protein release from P01375 -α-activated human lung fibroblasts . The combination of interferon-γ and P01375 -α induced enhanced P24001 release in human lung fibroblasts , whereas P05112 , Q16552 , Q8TAD2 and TLR ligands did not alter P24001 release in human lung fibroblasts either alone , or in combination with P01375 -α . Furthermore , the activation of Akt and JNK pathways regulated P01375 -α-induced P24001 expression in human lung fibroblasts , and inhibition of the Akt and JNK pathways was able to suppress the increased release of P24001 to nearly the basal level . These data suggest that P01375 -α may be involved in airway inflammation via the induction of P24001 by activating Akt and JNK signalling pathways . Therefore , the P01375 -α/ P24001 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for airway inflammatory diseases .
