Immunogenicity of the Brucella melitensis recombinant ribosome recycling factor-homologous protein and its cDNA . A study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Brucella melitensis ribosome recycling factor ( Q96E11 ) -homologous protein ( CP24 ) . The CP24 gene was cloned , expressed in Escherichia coli and purified . The resulting purified recombinant protein ( rCP24 ) produced delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reactions in B. melitensis-infected mice but not in naive controls . Thus , we decided to characterise the immune responses generated with DNA vaccination ( pcDNACP24 ) or immunisation with the rCP24 in adjuvant . Animals injected with pcDNACP24 exhibited a dominance of IgG2a to IgG1 while mice injected with rCP24 developed a higher response of IgG1 than IgG2a . Both immunisation protocols were capable of eliciting CP24-specific gamma interferon ( P01579 ) producing cells . Spleen cells from pcDNACP24-immunised mice did not produce interleukin ( IL ) -4 , P22301 or up-regulation of P60568 mRNA . Cells from rCP24-immunised mice produced P22301 , up-regulated P60568 mRNA but did not produce P05112 . Neither immunisation with purified CP24 nor injection of pcDNACP24 protected mice against challenge with live smooth B. melitensis . However , the potential of CP24 for a Brucella diagnostic test based on an in vitro antigen ( Ag ) -specific P01579 production or DTH test would be worth testing .
