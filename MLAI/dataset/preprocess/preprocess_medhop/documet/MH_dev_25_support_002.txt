T cell costimulation : a rational target in the therapeutic armamentarium for autoimmune diseases and transplantation . T cells are central mediators of adaptive immunity . As such , they are involved in both normal immune responses ( e.g. , rejection of a transplanted organ ) and abnormal ones ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis ) . T cells require both antigen-specific and costimulatory signals for their full activation . Advances in protein engineering and an increased understanding of the immune response have culminated in the evolution and creation of protein therapeutics that target specific costimulatory molecules . The selective costimulation modulator abatacept ( CTLA-4Ig ) binds to P33681 and P42081 , blocking interaction with P10747 , and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis . DB06681 , currently enrolling phase III trials in renal transplantation , was rationally designed from abatacept to bind with more avidity to P42081 , providing the more potent immunosuppressive properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation . This review describes the relevant immunology and summarizes recent clinical findings on these two molecules . Although both inhibit the P10747 costimulatory pathway , they are tailored for specific disease states -- abatacept for autoimmune diseases and belatacept for transplantation .
