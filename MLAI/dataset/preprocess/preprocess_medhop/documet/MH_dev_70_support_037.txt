P02786 and P60709 as the best reference genes to quantify DB00013 P00747 Activator in breast cancer . BACKGROUND : Biomedical researchers have long looked for ways to diagnose and treat cancer patients at the early stages through biomarkers . Although conventional techniques are routinely applied in the detection of biomarkers , attitudes towards using Real-Time PCR techniques in detection of many biomarkers are increasing . Normalization of quantitative Real-Time PCR is necessary to validate non-biological alteration occurring during the steps of RNA quantification . Selection of variably expressed housekeeping genes ( HKs ) will affect the validity of the data . The aim of the present study was to identify uniformly expressed housekeeping genes in order to use in the breast cancer gene expression studies . DB00013 P00747 Activator was used as a gene of interest . FINDINGS : The expression of six HKs ( P02786 , P08236 , P04406 , P60709 , P00492 and P05388 ) was investigated using geNorm and NormFinder softwares in forty breast tumor , four normal and eight adjacent tissues . P05388 and P04406 revealed maximum M value , while P02786 demonstrated lowest M value . CONCLUSIONS : In the present study the most and the least stable genes were P02786 and P05388 respectively . P02786 and P60709 were verified as the best combination of two genes for breast cancer quantification . The result of this study shows that in each gene expression analysis HKs selection should be done based on experiment conditions .
