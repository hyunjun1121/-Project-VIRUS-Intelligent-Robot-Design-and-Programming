Estrogen-dependent regulation of P37231 signaling on collagen biosynthesis in adenocarcinoma endometrial cells . The link between estrogen and metabolic developmental factors of endometrial carcinoma is well established . Q07869 - gamma , ( an important modulator of metabolism ) and estrogen receptor belong to a family of nuclear hormone receptors that were shown to interact with each other . The interaction may affect transcriptional activity of these transcription factors . The anti-diabetic troglitazone ( Q96PF1 ) is well known Q07869 - gamma ligand . The effect of troglitazone-induced Q07869 - gamma activation on estrogen-dependent stimulation of collagen biosynthesis was studied in the Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line . We have found that the presence of estrogen activity in growth medium ( 1nM ) augmented collagen biosynthesis in the cells . An addition of Q07869 - gamma agonists , as troglitazone or clofibrat to the growth medium induced inhibition of collagen biosynthesis . The inhibition was effective only when estrogen receptor was stimulated , since removal of estrogen receptor by ICI 182- 780-dependent degradation did not affect collagen biosynthesis . The mechanism of the inhibition was found at the level of NF-kB ( known inhibitor of collagen gene expression ) and MAPK signaling . Q07869 - gamma ligands stimulated expression of NF-kB , while they inhibited expression of p-38 but not P27361 / P28482 . The data document for the first time that inhibitory effect of Q07869 - gamma ligands on collagen biosynthesis in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells requires functional estrogen receptor .
