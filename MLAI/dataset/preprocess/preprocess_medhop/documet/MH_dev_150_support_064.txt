P10275 is essential for sexual differentiation of responses to olfactory cues in mice . During sexual differentiation males and females are exposed to different levels of testosterone , which promotes sex differences in the adult brain and in behavior . DB00624 can act after aromatization or reduction via a number of steroid hormone receptors . Here we provide new evidence that the androgen receptor ( AR ) is essential for sexual differentiation in mice . We used mice carrying the testicular feminization ( Tfm ) mutation of the AR . Adult Tfm males , wild-type male and female littermates were gonadectomized and given subcutaneous estradiol implants . In all sexually dimorphic traits , Tfm males had responses equivalent to females and different from males . In simultaneous choice tests , males spent significantly more time investigating female-soiled bedding , whereas females and Tfm males preferred to investigate male-soiled bedding . Tfm males and females did not have a partner preference in tests with awake stimulus animals , whereas males showed a preference for females over males . Exposure to male-soiled , but not clean , bedding produced a significant increase in c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the medial preoptic area and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in Tfm males and females , no increase was noted in males . Masculine sexual behavior ( mounting and thrusting ) was not sexually dimorphic , and all groups displayed these behaviors . Our results support data collected in humans suggesting a role for the androgen receptor in sexual differentiation of social preferences and neural responses to pheromones .
