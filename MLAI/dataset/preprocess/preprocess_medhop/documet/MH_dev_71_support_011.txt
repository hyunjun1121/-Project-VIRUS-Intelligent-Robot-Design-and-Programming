Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics , preclinical and clinical efficacy of pralatrexate for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma . INTRODUCTION : Peripheral T-cell lymphomas ( PTCLs ) are a heterogeneous group of T-cell neoplasms . Most patients with PTCL have a poor outcome with conventional therapies and are not cured without stem-cell transplantation . DB06813 , a novel antifolate chemotherapeutic agent , was rationally designed to impede folate metabolism by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) and to be more efficiently internalized into tumor cells . DB06813 is the first drug that is FDA approved for patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL . AREAS COVERED : DB06813 has been used as a single agent and in combination with other agents in clinical trials for non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and Hodgkin 's disease as well as in solid tumors . This review will cover the development of pralatrexate , the pharmacokinetics of pralatrexate , preclinical findings with pralatrexate and clinical studies of pralatrexate in hematologic malignancies . EXPERT OPINION : DB06813 has significant activity in vitro , and in early Phase I/II trials , responses were noted in patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas . The DB06813 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma trial demonstrated the activity of pralatrexate across a spectrum of heavily pretreated patients with different aggressive T-cell lymphoma subtypes , and studies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have shown efficacy at different doses and schedules . The most frequent adverse events in these trials were mucositis , reversible thrombocytopenia and fatigue .
