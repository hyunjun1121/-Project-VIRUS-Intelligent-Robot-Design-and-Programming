Dermatological adverse events from P15056 inhibitors : a growing problem . The development of targeted therapies has ushered in a new era in the management of melanoma . Inhibitors of the DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway have taken the center stage with development at a rapid pace . DB08881 was recently approved by regulatory agencies , and other agents ( e.g. dabrafenib ) are in various stages of clinical testing . These agents are producing remarkable results for patients , but are also presenting new challenges . Clinical toxicities and drug resistance are topmost issues . Some of the most common and vivid representations of adverse events to these agents are the dermatologic manifestations . Published trials and initial observations reflect a toxicity profile ( e.g. squamous cell carcinomas/keratoacanthomas , maculopapular rashes , hyperkeratosis ) that is distinct from cutaneous toxicities from P00533 and P42345 inhibitors ( acneiform rash , paronychia , xerosis ) . Their management extends beyond conservative treatment and includes specific physical and surgical treatment modalities , skill sets unique to dermatologists . All these pose significant challenges to clinicians , and sound knowledge of such toxicities and their management will likely result in improved patient outcomes and quality of life . In this manuscript , we provide an overview of the emerging scientific literature on dermatological adverse events arising out of P15056 inhibition .
