DB06186 administration for advanced melanoma in patients with pre-existing Hepatitis B or C infection : a multicenter , retrospective case series . DB06186 is a fully human , monoclonal antibody directed against Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen-4 ( P16410 ) that has demonstrated a survival benefit and durable disease control in patients with advanced melanoma . DB06186 is associated with potentially serious immune-related adverse events , including autoimmune hepatitis . Because clinical trials of ipilimumab excluded patients with pre-existing hepatitis B or C infection , there is a paucity of data on the safety of ipilimumab administration to that patient population . Here , we report the largest case series to date of patients with hepatitis B or C who received ipilimumab for advanced melanoma . Two of the nine patients described in this case series experienced fluctuations in their liver function tests ( LFTs ) and were subsequently treated with corticosteroids . Although this is a small series , the rate of hepatotoxicity appears similar to what has been seen in the general population treated with ipilimumab , and the ability to administer ipilimumab did not appear to be affected by concomitant hepatitis B or C infection . The use of ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma who have pre-existing hepatitis can be considered among other therapeutic options .
