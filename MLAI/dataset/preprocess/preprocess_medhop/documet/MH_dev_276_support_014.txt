Rational design of an P01133 - Q14116 fusion protein : implication for developing tumor therapeutics . Q14116 ( Q14116 ) is a proinflammatory cytokine . This protein has a role in regulating immune responses and exhibits significant anti-tumor activities . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) is an important growth factor that plays a central role in the regulation of cell cycle and differentiation . It was proposed that a targeted delivery of Q14116 by generation of Q14116 - P01133 fusion protein might decrease adverse effects and result in enhancing cytotoxic and antitumor activities . In the present study , a fusion protein , consisting of P00533 binding domain fused to human Q14116 mature peptide via a linker peptide of ( DB00145 (4) DB00133 ) 3 , was constructed and expressed in the insect cell line Sf9 using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system . We showed that the purified recombinant fusion protein induced similar levels of P01579 to that of native Q14116 protein in human PBMC in the presence of ConA . Furthermore , P01133 receptor competitive test in human epithelial cancer A431 cell line showed that P01133 - Q14116 fusion protein can specifically bind with P00533 by competing with native P01133 protein . These suggest that this rationally designed protein can be further developed as novel tumor therapeutics .
