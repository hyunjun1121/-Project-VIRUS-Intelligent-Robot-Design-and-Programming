Procyanidin induces apoptosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma cells via JNK activation of c-Jun . Procyanidins are polymeric flavanols found in fruits and vegetables and have shown anticarcinogenic/chemopreventive properties . We previously showed that oligomeric procyanidin extracted from apples induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma ( OA ) cells . To understand the mechanism of action , we determined transcriptomic changes induced by procyanidin in OA cells . Pathway analysis implicated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in eliciting these responses . Procyanidin induced the activation of JNK and p38 and the phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun . Inhibition of JNK but not p38 kinase activity prevented the procyanidin-induced phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun . Knockdown of the expression of P45983 , P45984 , or P05412 diminished procyanidin-induced effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis . c-Jun is a component of the transcription factor AP-1 and AP-1 binding sites are overrepresented in the promoters of procyanidin-induced genes . This indicates that JNK activation of c-Jun by procyanidin leads to the induction of apoptosis of OA cells and suggests a role for a c-Jun-mediated transcriptional program . These data provide a mechanistic understanding of how procyanidin specifically targets a distinct pathway involved in the induction of apoptosis in OA cells and will inform future studies investigating its use as a chemopreventive/therapeutic agent .
