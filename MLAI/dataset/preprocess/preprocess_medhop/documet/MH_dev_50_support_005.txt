Refined localization and yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) contig -- mapping of genes and DNA segments in the 7q21-q32 region . The chromosome localizations for 159 gene and DNA segments have been refined to one of five intervals in the 7q21-132 region through hybridization analysis with a panel of somatic cell hybrid lines . Seventy-two of these chromosome 7 markers are also mapped on common or overlapping yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) clones . In addition , the breakpoints of chromosome rearrangement contained in five of the somatic cell hybrid lines have been defined by flanking probes within YAC contigs . To provide a framework for further mapping of the 7q21-q32 region , we have established the physical order of a set of reference markers : cen-( P08123 -D7S15- P08684 - P27169 )-D7S456- ( brea kpoint contained in cell hybrid 1EF2/3/K017 ) - P08236 -D7S186-ASL- ( P08183 - P21439 - P62879 -EPO- P22303 ) -D7S238- ( proximal breakpoint in GM1059-Rag5 ) -D7S240-(CUTL1- P05121 )- ( breakp oints in 1CF2/5/K016 and 2068Rag22-2 ) -( P31323 -D7S13)- P07942 - ( breakpoint in JSR-17S ) -DLD-D7S16-MET- P09544 - P13569 -D7S8-tel .
