Inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 signaling reduces tumor burden in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of early intestinal cancer . The Apc(Min/+) mouse model is a clinically relevant model of early intestinal cancer . We used DB04849 , an oral , highly potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) signaling inhibitor , to investigate the role of P15692 receptor-2 ( P35968 ) signaling in adenoma development and growth in Apc(Min/+) mice . DB04849 ( 5 mg/kg body wt/day ) was administered once daily for 28 days to 6-week-old ( early-intervention ) or 10-week-old ( late intervention ) mice . In the early-intervention study , DB04849 reduced the number of macroscopic polyps in the small bowel and colon . Macropolyp diameter was lower in the small bowel , but remained unchanged in the colon . In animals receiving DB04849 , microscopic evaluation of the small intestine showed a significant reduction in the number of larger lesions . In the late-intervention study , DB04849 treatment reduced macropolyp diameter ( but not number ) in the small intestine . Microscopic analysis revealed that DB04849 significantly reduced the number of larger micropolyps in the small bowel , with no large micropolyps present in the colon . DB04849 treatment had no effect on microvessel density or localization of beta-catenin staining in adenomas or non-tumor intestinal tissue , but significantly reduced the number of cells expressing P35968 mRNA . In conclusion , the effects of DB04849 in the small intestine of Apc(Min/+) mice are consistent with an antiangiogenic mechanism of action , limiting growth of adenomas to < or =1 mm . These data also suggest that an early step in adenoma development may depend on P35968 signaling . Together , these results indicate that P35968 signaling may play key roles in the development and progression of intestinal adenomas .
