Interactions Between Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Kinase Inhibition , Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 Inhibition and P38398 Status in Breast Cancer Cells . BACKGROUND : Cells harboring P38398 / P51587 mutations are hypersensitive to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) . We recently showed that interference with P09874 activity by DB02690 is strongly cytotoxic for P38398 -positive BT-20 cells but not P38398 -deficient SKBr-3 cells . These unexpected observations prompted speculation that other P09874 inhibitor(s) may be more cytotoxic towards SKBr-3 cells . In addition , interference with the DNA damage signaling pathway via ( for instance ) Q13315 ( Q13315 ) kinase inhibition may induce synthetic lethality in DNA repair-deficient breast cancer cells and pharmacological interference with Q13315 activity may sensitize breast cancer cells to P09874 inactivation . METHODS : We determined drug cytotoxicity in human MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells using the CellTiterGLO Luminescent cell viability assay and a Tecan multi-label , multitask plate counter to measure generated luminescence . Changes in cell cycle progression were monitored by flow cytometric measurement of DNA content in cells stained with propidium iodide . RESULTS : Unlike DB02690 , AZD2461 , a new P09874 inhibitor , markedly reduced the numbers of living MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells . Q13315 kinase inhibition ( CP466722 ) was also cytotoxic for both MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells . Furthermore , AZD2461 enhanced the cytotoxicity of CP466722 in both cell lines by inducing apoptosis , and concurrent inhibition of Q13315 and P09874 reduced cell proliferation more strongly than either single treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Our data show that inhibition of P09874 by AZD2461 is synthetically lethal for DB02690 -resistant MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells . They also indicate that DNA damage signaling is essential for survival of both SKBr-3 and MCF-7 cells , especially after inactivation of P09874 .
