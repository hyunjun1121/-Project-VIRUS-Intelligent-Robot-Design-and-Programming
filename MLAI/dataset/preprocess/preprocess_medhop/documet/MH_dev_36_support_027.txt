Effects of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit against acetaminophen-induced liver damage in mice via induction of autophagy and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis . The effect of the total saponins from Rosa laevigata Michx fruit ( RLTS ) against acetaminophen ( DB00316 ) -induced liver damage in mice was evaluated in the present paper . The results showed that RLTS markedly improved the levels of liver SOD , CAT , DB00143 , DB00143 -Px , MDA , NO and P35228 , and the activities of serum ALT and Q9NRA2 caused by DB00316 . Further research confirmed that RLTS prevented fragmentation of DNA and mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations based on TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) assays . In addition , RLTS decreased the gene or protein expressions of cytochrome P450 ( P05181 ) , pro-inflammatory mediators ( IL-1β , P05112 , P05231 , P01375 -α , P35228 , Bax , HMGB-1 and P35354 ) , pro-inflammatory transcription factors ( NF-κB and AP-1 ) , pro-apoptotic proteins ( cytochrome C , p53 , caspase-3 , caspase-9 , p-JNK , p-p38 and p- P29323 ) , and increased the protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL . Moreover , the gene expression of P22301 , and the proteins including LC3 , Q14457 and Atg5 induced by DB00316 were even more augmented by the extract . These results demonstrate that RLTS has hepatoprotective effects through antioxidative action , induction of autophagy , and suppression of inflammation and apoptosis , and could be developed as a potential candidate to treat DB00316 -induced liver damage in the future .
