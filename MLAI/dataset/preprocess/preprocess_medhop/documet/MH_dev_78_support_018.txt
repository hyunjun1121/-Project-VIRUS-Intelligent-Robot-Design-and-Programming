DB00945 triggers formation of anti-inflammatory mediators : New mechanism for an old drug . Extract : DB00945 is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) . It is well documented that aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) by acetylation of an amino acid serine residue , and thus blocks the subsequent biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane . P36551 has at least two forms , P23219 and P35354 . P23219 is the main form present in mature platelets in the blood , where it transforms arachidonic acid to the intermediates PG-G/H , which are subsequently converted to thromboxane A2 . Thromboxane A2 is a vasoconstrictor and potent platelet activator . Thus , inhibition of thromboxane A2 formation explains aspirin 's anti-thrombotic properties . In the early 1990s , a second form of P36551 was identified , namely P35354 . P35354 was initially conceptualized as an " inducible " P36551 that is elevated in its quantity by a wide range of agents that stimulate inflammation or cell division and seems to be responsible for local formation during inflammation and cancer .
