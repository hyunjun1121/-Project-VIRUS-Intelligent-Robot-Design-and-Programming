5- Q13049 receptor induces P29323 phosphorylation and proliferation through ADAM-17 tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme ( P78536 ) activation and heparin-bound epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) shedding in mesangial cells . In this study , we present multiple lines of evidence to support a critical role for heparin-bound P01133 ( epidermal growth factor ) -like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme ( P78536 ) ( P78536 ) in the transactivation of P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) , P29323 phosphorylation , and cellular proliferation induced by the 5-HT(2A) receptor in renal mesangial cells . 5-hydroxy-tryptamine ( 5-HT ) resulted in rapid activation of P78536 , HB- P01133 shedding , P00533 activation , P29323 phosphorylation , and longer term increases in DNA content in mesangial cells . P29323 phosphorylation was attenuated by 1 ) neutralizing P00533 antibodies and the P00533 kinase inhibitor , AG1478 , 2 ) neutralizing HB- P01133 , but not amphiregulin , antibodies , heparin , or CM197 , and 3 ) pharmacological inhibitors of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases or P78536 small interfering RNA . Exogenously administered HB- P01133 stimulated P29323 phosphorylation . Additionally , P78536 was co-immunoprecipitated with HB- P01133 . Small interfering RNA against P78536 also blocked 5-HT-induced increases in P29323 phosphorylation , HB- P01133 shedding , and DNA content . In aggregate , this work supports a pathway map that can be depicted as follows : 5-HT --> 5-HT(2A) receptor --> P78536 --> HB- P01133 shedding --> P00533 --> P29323 --> increased DNA content . To our knowledge , this is the first time that P78536 has been implicated in 5-HT-induced P00533 transactivation or in proliferation induced by a G protein-coupled receptor in native cells in culture .
