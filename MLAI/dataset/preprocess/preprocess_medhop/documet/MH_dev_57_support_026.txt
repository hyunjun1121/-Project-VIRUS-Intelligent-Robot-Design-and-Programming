The bile acid receptor Q96RI1 is a modulator of intestinal innate immunity . The farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) is a bile acid-regulated nuclear receptor expressed in enterohepatic tissues . In this study we investigated whether Q96RI1 is expressed by cells of innate immunity and regulates inflammation in animal models of colitis . Acute ( 7 days ) and chronic ( 8 wk ) colitis were induced in wild-type and Q96RI1 (-/-) mice by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzensulfonic acid or by 7-day administration of 5 % dextran sulfate in drinking water . The results of this experiment demonstrate that Q96RI1 is expressed by and exerts counterregulatory effects on cells of innate immunity . Exposure of LPS-activated macrophages to 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid ( 6E- DB06777 ; INT-747 ) a synthetic Q96RI1 ligand , results in a reciprocal regulation of NF-kappaB dependent-genes ( P01375 , IL-1beta , P05231 , P23219 , P35354 , and P35228 ) and induction of Q15466 , a Q96RI1 -regulated gene . Q96RI1 activation stabilizes the nuclear corepressor NCoR on the NF-kappaB responsive element on the IL-1beta promoter . Colon inflammation in Crohn 's disease patients and in rodent models of colitis is associated with a reduced expression of Q96RI1 mRNA . Using two rodent models of colon inflammation , we show that progression of these immune-mediated disorders is exacerbated in Q96RI1 (-/-) mice ( p < 0.01 ) . In vivo treatment with INT-747 attenuates organ injury and immune cell activation . Q96RI1 activation increased the colon expression of P51161 , Q96RI1 , and Q15466 while reducing IL-1beta , P60568 , P05231 , P01375 , and P01579 mRNA expression and attenuating disease severity . In aggregate , these findings provide evidence that Q96RI1 is an essential component of a network of nuclear receptors that regulate intestinal innate immunity and homeostasis .
