DB00316 -inhibitable P35354 . Although paracetamol potently reduces pain and fever , its mechanism of action has so far not been satisfactorily explained . It inhibits both P23219 and P35354 weakly in vitro , but reduces prostaglandin synthesis markedly in vivo . In mouse macrophage J774.2 cells , P35354 induced for 48 hr with high concentrations of NSAIDs is more sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol than endotoxin-induced P35354 . In the rat pleurisy model of inflammation , a second peak of P35354 protein appears 48 hr after administration of the inflammatory stimulus , during the resolution phase of the inflammatory process . Inhibition of the activity of this late-appearing P35354 with indomethacin or a selective P35354 inhibitor , delays resolution and the inflammation is prolonged . Cultured lung fibroblasts also express P35354 activity after stimulation with IL-1beta which is highly sensitive to inhibition with paracetamol . Thus , evidence is accumulating for the existence of a P35354 variant or a new P36551 enzyme which can be inhibited with paracetamol .
