P43119 signaling and early embryo development in the mouse . BACKGROUND : DB01240 ( P06744 (2) ) plays an important role in mouse embryo development and implantation . However , it is unclear whether its action is mediated via the I prostaglandin receptor ( IP ) . METHODS : We compared the preimplantation development of IP deleted ( IP-/- ) embryos and wild-type ( WT ) embryos . We also evaluated the effect of iloprost , a stable P06744 (2) analog , and L-165041 , a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta ( PPARdelta ) ligand , on IP-/- versus WT embryos . Finally , we compared the development of heterozygous IP deficient embryos carrying a normal maternal IP allele versus paternal IP allele . RESULTS : Development of IP-/- embryos lagged behind WT embryos and was not enhanced by either the P06744 (2) analog or the PPARdelta ligand . WT embryos had slightly higher , although statistically not significant , implantation rates than IP-/- embryos . Heterozygous IP deficient embryos carrying a normal maternal IP allele showed better development and responded to the P06744 (2) analog , unlike those carrying the normal paternal IP allele . CONCLUSIONS : IP receptors play an important role in preimplantation embryo development and mediate the embryo 's response to exogenous P06744 (2) . Early embryo development depends on the oocyte IP receptor .
