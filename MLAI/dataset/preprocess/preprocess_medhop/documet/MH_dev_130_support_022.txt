Bilateral Vocal Cord Carcinoma in a Sarcoidosis Patient during DB00065 Therapy . Introduction. Although the role of P01375 - α in tumor development is not fully understood , an increased risk of malignancy with P01375 - α -inhibitors , such as infliximab , has been suggested . Case Presentation . We present a 54-year-old nonsmoking female sarcoidosis patient . After seven months of infliximab therapy a T1aN0M0 larynx carcinoma of the right vocal cord was found and excised . Within a year , whilst still on treatment , a second larynx carcinoma of the opposite vocal cord appeared . Discussion . A bilateral vocal cord tumor is rare , especially in a never smoker . Evidence on the role of infliximab in carcinogenesis is inconclusive . To date , there are no follow-up studies evaluating malignancy risk of infliximab therapy in sarcoidosis patients . No studies in other diseases focus on laryngeal carcinomas during infliximab use . We argue that infliximab treatment might have attributed to the rapid progression of vocal cord carcinomas in this patient with an a priori low risk tumor profile . This case illustrates that caution remains warranted in patients with previous malignancies when considering initiation of P01375 - α -inhibitors .
