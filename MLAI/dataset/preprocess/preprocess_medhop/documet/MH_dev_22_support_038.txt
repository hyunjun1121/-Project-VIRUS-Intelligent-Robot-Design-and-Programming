DB05773 ( DB05773 ) retains all the mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and efficiently inhibits growth of lapatinib insensitive breast cancer . DB00072 ( Herceptin(®) ) is currently used as a treatment for patients whose breast tumors overexpress P04626 /ErbB2 . DB05773 ( DB05773 , trastuzumab emtansine ) is designed to combine the clinical benefits of trastuzumab with a potent microtubule-disrupting drug , DM1 ( a maytansine derivative ) . Currently DB05773 is being tested in multiple clinical trials . The mechanisms of action for trastuzumab include inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , inhibition of HER-2 shedding and Fcγ receptor mediated engagement of immune cells , which may result in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Here we report that DB05773 retains the mechanisms of action of unconjugated trastuzumab and is active against lapatinib resistant cell lines and tumors .
