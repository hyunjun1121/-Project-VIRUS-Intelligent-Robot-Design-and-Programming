P01116 , P00533 , P09619 -α , P10721 and P35354 status in carcinoma showing thymus-like elements ( CASTLE ) . BACKGROUND : CASTLE ( Carcinoma showing thymus-like elements ) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the thyroid resembling lymphoepithelioma-like and squamous cell carcinoma of the thymus with different biological behaviour and a better prognosis than anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid . METHODS : We retrospectively investigated 6 cases of this very rare neoplasm in order to investigate the mutational status of P01116 , P00533 , P09619 -α and P10721 , as well as the immunohistochemical expression pattern of CD117 , P00533 and P35354 , and possibly find new therapeutic targets . RESULTS : Diagnosis was confirmed by a moderate to strong expression of P06127 , CD117 and CK5/6 , whereas thyroglobulin , calcitonin and Q15669 -1 were negative in all cases . Tumors were also positive for P35354 and in nearly all cases for P00533 . In four cases single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) could be detected in exon 12 of the P09619 -α gene ( rs1873778 ) , in three cases SNPs were found in exon 20 of the P00533 gene ( rs1050171 ) . No mutations were found in the P10721 and P01116 gene . CONCLUSIONS : All tumors showed a P35354 expression as well as an P00533 expression except for one case and a wild-type P01116 status . No activating mutations in the P00533 , P10721 and P09619 -α gene could be detected . Our data may indicate a potential for targeted therapies , but if these therapeutic strategies are of benefit in CASTLE remains to be determined .
