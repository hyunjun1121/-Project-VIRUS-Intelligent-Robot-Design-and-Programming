Molecular mechanisms involving prostate cancer racial disparity . African American ( AA ) men with prostate cancer ( PCa ) have worse disease , with a higher incidence , younger age and more advanced disease at diagnosis , and a worse prognosis , compared to Caucasian ( CA ) men . In addition to socioeconomic factors and lifestyle differences , molecular alterations contribute to this discrepancy . In this review , we summarize molecular genetics research results interrelated with the biology of PCa racial disparity . Androgen and androgen receptor ( AR ) pathways have long been associated with prostate growth . Racial differences have also been found among variants of the genes of the enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis and metabolism , such as P31213 , P05093 , and P08684 . The levels of expression and CAG repeat length of AR also show racial divergence and may be critical molecular alterations for racial disparity . Growth factors and their receptors , which promote cancer cell growth , are another potential cause of the disparity ; both P00533 and P29323 , two of the most studied receptors , show interethnic differences . Differences have also been found among genes regulating cell apoptosis , such as P10415 , which is increased in PCa in the AA population . Recent developments in genetics , proteomics , and genomics , among other molecular biotechnologies , will greatly aid the advancement of translational research on PCa racial disparity , hopefully culminating in the discovery of novel mechanisms of disease , in addition to prognostic markers and novel therapeutic approaches .
