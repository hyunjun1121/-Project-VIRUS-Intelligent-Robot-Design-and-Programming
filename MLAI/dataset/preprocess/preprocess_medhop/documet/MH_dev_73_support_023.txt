Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands . Delta9- DB00470 , a major psychoactive component of marijuana , has been shown to interact with specific cannabinoid receptors , thereby eliciting a variety of pharmacological responses in experimental animals and human . In 1990 , the gene encoding a cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) was cloned . This prompted the search for endogenous ligands . In 1992 , N-arachidonoylethanolamine ( anandamide ) was isolated from pig brain as an endogenous ligand , and in 1995 , 2-arachidonoylglycerol was isolated from rat brain and canine gut as another endogenous ligand . Both anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol exhibit various cannabimimetic activities . The results of structure-activity relationship experiments , however , revealed that 2-arachidonoylglycerol , but not anandamide , is the intrinsic natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptor . 2-Arachidonoylglycerol is a degradation product of inositol phospholipids that links the function of cannabinoid receptors with the enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover in stimulated tissues and cells . The possible physiological roles of cannabinoid receptors and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in various mammalian tissues such as those of the nervous system are discussed .
