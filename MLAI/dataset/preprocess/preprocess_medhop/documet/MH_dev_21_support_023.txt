DB00013 mediates endothelial cell survival via induction of the P98170 . P00749 ( uPA ) additionally elicits a whole array of pro-angiogenic responses , such as differentiation , proliferation , and migration . In this study , we demonstrate that in endothelial cells uPA also protects against apoptosis by transcriptional up-regulation and partially by mRNA stabilization of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , most prominently the P98170 ( P98170 ) . The antiapoptotic activity of uPA was dependent on its protease activity , the presence of uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) , but independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3 ( P19957 ) kinase pathway , whereas vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -induced antiapoptosis was P19957 kinase dependent . uPA-induced cell survival involved phosphorylation of Q13153 ( Pak1 ) and the O15111 alpha that leads to nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) p52 activation . Indeed , blocking NF-kappaB activation by using specific NF-kappaB inhibitors abolished uPA-induced cell survival as it blocked uPA-induced P98170 up-regulation . Furthermore , down-regulating P98170 expression by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) significantly reduced uPA-dependent endothelial cell survival . This mechanism is also important for P15692 -induced antiapoptosis because P15692 -dependent up-regulation of P98170 was found defective in uPA(-/-) endothelial cells . This led us to conclude that uPA is part of a novel NF-kappaB-dependent cell survival pathway .
