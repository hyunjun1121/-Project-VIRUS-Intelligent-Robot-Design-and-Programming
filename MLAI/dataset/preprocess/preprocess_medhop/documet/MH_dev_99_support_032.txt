Proteasomal serine hydrolases are up-regulated by and required for influenza virus infection . Interactions between viruses and their host cells are important determinants of virus replication and of immune responses to the virus . However , these interactions and resulting consequences of these interactions remain poorly defined . Numerous recent quantitative proteomic approaches have measured host proteins affected by virus infection . Here , we used activity-based protein profiling ( P05067 ) to measure functional alterations in host serine hydrolases after influenza A virus infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney and human A549 lung cells . We identified 62 serine proteases . We then combined the P05067 approach with stable isotope labeling to directly measure how serine hydrolase activities were affected by virus infection . Differentially regulated SHs mapped into a few key cellular pathway systems , most notably the proteasomal system . The specific serine protease inhibitors DB06692 and Pefablock and specific proteasomal inhibitors DB00188 and MG132 significantly inhibited influenza virus growth . Some inhibitors also down-regulated activities of several proteasomal proteins , including P25786 , P25787 , and PMSB3 . Genetic knockdown of PMSA2 also attenuated influenza virus replication . These findings further our understanding of enzymatic cellular processes affected by influenza virus and may be beneficial in the search for additional antiviral therapeutic targets .
