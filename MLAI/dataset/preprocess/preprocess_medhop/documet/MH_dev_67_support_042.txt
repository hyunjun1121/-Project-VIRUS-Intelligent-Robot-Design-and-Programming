Transcriptional regulation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene is mediated in part by a putative repressor element and by the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element . The levels of the P30968 ( GnRHR ) and its messenger RNA depend on the pattern of administration of DB00644 . In this study , internal deletion mutants in a luciferase reporter gene vector ( GnRHR-pXP2 ) containing a 1226-bp promoter fragment of mouse GnRHR gene were used to examine the regulation of GnRHR gene transcription in GGH3 cells . Our results indicate that the mouse GnRHR promoter contains one putative repressor element located at position -343/-335 . When this sequence was deleted , the GnRHR promoter activity was significantly increased in both basal and DB00644 agonist ( DB06719 ) - , phorbol ester- , and forskolin-stimulated cells . Gel mobility shift assay showed that the sequence -343/-335 is capable of binding GGH3 nuclear proteins . With deletion of the DB02527 response element ( -107/-100 ) , basal and DB06719 -stimulated transcription was decreased . The same response was observed after stimulation with forskolin . Stimulation with (Bu)2cAMP did not alter transcription above basal levels . The stimulation with phorbol ester resulted in an attenuated increase in transcriptional activity , suggesting that this sequence of the GnRHR promoter is a DB02527 response element . These results suggest that the transcriptional activity of the GnRHR gene is mediated in part by a putative repressor element and by the DB02527 response element .
