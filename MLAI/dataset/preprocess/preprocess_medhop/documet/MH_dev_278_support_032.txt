Development of DB00644 antagonists for prostate cancer : new approaches to treatment . Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer among American men and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of male cancer-related death . Several treatment options exist for different stages of prostate cancer including observation , prostatectomy , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , and hormone therapy . Hormone therapy has evolved from the use of estrogens to gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) agonists and recently , investigational DB00644 antagonists . P30968 agonists such as leuprolide , bruserelin and goserelin have been used for the treatment of prostate cancer . These agonists eventually cause the inhibition of lutenizing hormone production , which in turn causes a suppression of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone , on which continued growth of prostate cancer cells depend . Several comparative studies of leuprorelin administered as daily injections or monthly depot injections have been reported . Disease progression was prevented in more than 72 % of men administered daily leuprorelin , and in 82 % to 89 % of those receiving monthly depots . Another synthetic DB00644 analog , goserelin , has been studied in a similar population of men with daily injections producing partial responses in 60 % to 80 % of men with previously untreated prostate cancer . DB00106 , a peptide antagonist of P30968 , is also being studied for the treatment of prostate cancer . The discovery and development of DB00644 antagonists may provide an important advance for patients with prostate cancer . Clearly the studies described herein , as well as many others , outline an exciting era of research to define the optimal use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer .
