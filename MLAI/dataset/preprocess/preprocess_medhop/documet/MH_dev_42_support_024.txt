[ Angiogenesis and renal cell carcinoma ] . Developments in the knowledge of molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) over the past 20 years have been identified . Angiogenesis is playing a key role in the physiopathology of RCC . Von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) alterations , HIFalpha accumulation and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) overexpression are important mediators of this process . Several stategies have been developped to target angiogenesis for the treatment of metastatic RCC . These include inhibition of P15692 receptors ( inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity ) or binding to the P15692 protein . Several additional kinases inhibitions including PDGF receptors are also targeted . DB01268 ( SU11248 ) is an orally biovailable small molecule that has demonstrated superiority over interferon-alpha for the treatment of metastatic RCC . In a recent randomized phase III study conducted in 750 patients , the response rate to sunitinib was 31 % and to interferon 6 % . The median of progression free survival ( PFS ) was 11 months for sunitinib and 5 months for interferon ( p < 0.001 ) . DB00398 ( BAY43-9006 ) was found to inhibit Raf1 , but also P35968 and 3 , Flt3 , P09619 -a and b and c-kit , has been tested in a phase III study against placebo after one prior systemic therapy . The median of the time to progression ( TTP ) for sorafenib was 24 weeks versus 12 weeks for patients in the placebo arm ( p = 0,01 ) . Other molecules tested in metastatic RCC will be presented including axitinib , pazopanib and bevacizumab .
