Effects of two Asian sand dusts transported from the dust source regions of Inner Mongolia and northeast China on murine lung eosinophilia . The quality and quantity of toxic materials adsorbed onto Asian sand dust ( P51689 ) are different based on dust source regions and passage routes . The aggravating effects of two ASDs ( ASD1 and ASD2 ) transported from the source regions of Inner Mongolia and northeast China on lung eosinophilia were compared to clarify the role of toxic materials in P51689 . The ASDs contained different amounts of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and β-glucan ( ASD1 < ASD2 ) and SiO2 ( ASD1 > ASD2 ) . CD-1 mice were instilled intratracheally with ASD1 , ASD2 and/or ovalbumin ( OVA ) four times at 2-week intervals . ASD1 and ASD2 enhanced eosinophil recruitment induced by OVA in the submucosa of the airway , with goblet cell proliferation in the bronchial epithelium . ASD1 and ASD2 synergistically increased OVA-induced eosinophil-relevant cytokines interleukin-5 ( P05113 ) , P35225 ( ASD1 < ASD2 ) and chemokine eotaxin ( ASD1 > ASD2 ) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . ASD2 aggravating effects on lung eosinophilia were greater than ASD1 . The role of LPS and β-glucan in ASD2 on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators was assessed using in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) from wild type , O60603 -deficient ( O60603 -/- ) , O00206 -/- , and MyD88-/- mice ( on Balb/c background ) . ASD2-stimulated O60603 -/- BMDMs enhanced P05231 , IL-12 , P01375 -α , P13500 and MIP-1α secretion compared with ASD2-stimulated O00206 -/- BMDMs . Protein expression from ASD2-stimulated MyD88-/- BMDM were very low or undetectable . The in vitro results indicate that lung eosinophilia caused by P51689 is O00206 dependent . Therefore , the aggravation of OVA-related lung eosinophilia by P51689 may be dependent on toxic substances derived from microbes , such as LPS , rather than SiO2 .
