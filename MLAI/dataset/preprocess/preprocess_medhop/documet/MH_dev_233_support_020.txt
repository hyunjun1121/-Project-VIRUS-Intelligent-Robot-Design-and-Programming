Molecular determinants of trastuzumab efficacy : What is their clinical relevance ? DB00072 -containing therapy is a standard of care for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( P04626 ) -positive breast cancer . In pre-clinical models , a wide range of molecular mechanisms have been associated with reduced sensitivity to trastuzumab in vitro . These include expression of the truncated P04626 receptor fragment p95HER2 , activating mutation of the gene encoding the class 1A catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P42336 ) , loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( P60484 ) , activation of other downstream signal transducers , prevention of cell cycle arrest , increased signaling through alternative ( HER or non-HER ) tyrosine kinase receptors , and resistance to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . However , the clinical significance of these mechanisms as determinants of trastuzumab efficacy in vivo has been unclear . Here , we review clinical studies of potential predictive biomarkers of trastuzumab efficacy in P04626 -positive breast cancer and consider whether evaluation of such markers might inform patient selection for therapy . We find that clinical evidence relating to potential predictive biomarkers is mostly limited to small , retrospective studies , many of which have yielded conflicting findings . Some trends are evident in the retrospective data and in biomarker analyses from randomized clinical trials , particularly relating to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway , but none is sufficiently strong to form a basis for patient selection . This may be explained by the fact that multiple mechanisms of action determine the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab . In the absence of novel , validated biomarkers of efficacy , trastuzumab eligibility should continue to be based on evaluation of P04626 status according to standard methods .
