Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is a target of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs mediating cyclooxygenase-independent inhibition of lung cancer cell growth . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) inhibit the growth of different cancer cell types , suggesting a broad role for their cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) targets and eicosanoid products in tumor cell growth . Sulindac sulfide , a P36551 inhibitor , inhibited the growth of non-small-cell lung cancers ( NSCLC ) both in soft agar and as xenografts in nude mice . Importantly , the concentration of sulindac sulfide required to inhibit NSCLC cell growth greatly exceeded the concentration required to inhibit prostaglandin ( PG ) E(2) synthesis in NSCLC cells , suggesting that NSAID inhibition of cell growth is mediated by additional targets distinct from P36551 . Both sulindac sulfide and ciglitazone , a defined peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) agonist , stimulated a promoter construct containing a Q07869 response element linked to luciferase and potently inhibited NSCLC cell growth at similar concentrations , indicating a role for PPARgamma as a target of NSAID action in these cells . Overexpression of PPARgamma in NSCLC cells strongly inhibited the transformed growth properties of the cells , providing a molecular confirmation of the results obtained with the PPARgamma agonists . Increased expression of PPARgamma , as well as ciglitazone and sulindac sulfide induced expression of P12830 , which has been linked to increased differentiation of NSCLC . Despite the fact that SCLC cell lines expressed little or no cytosolic phospholipase A(2) , P23219 , or P35354 , sulindac sulfide and PPARgamma agonists also inhibited the transformed growth of these lung cancer cells . We propose that PPARgamma serves as a target for NSAIDs that accounts for P36551 -independent inhibition of lung cancer cell growth .
