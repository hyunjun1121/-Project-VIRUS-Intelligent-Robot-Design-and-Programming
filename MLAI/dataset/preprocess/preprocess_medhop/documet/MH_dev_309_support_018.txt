DB01076 induces insulin sensitization in Zucker lean and fatty rats . BACKGROUND : The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitors ( ' statins ' ) have been implicated in preventing new onset type 2 diabetes , whereas the mechanism of this effect is not known . We investigated the effects of an P04035 inhibitor , atorvastatin , on insulin sensitization in Zucker lean and fatty rats . METHODS AND RESULTS : In vivo studies of insulin sensitization were performed in chow fed Zucker lean and fatty rats treated with atorvastatin 50mg/kg/day ( ATORVA_50 ) and results were compared to Zucker lean and fatty rats treated with drug vehicle only ( CONT ) . Additional Zucker lean rats were treated with an intermediate dose of atorvastatin 25mg/kg/day ( ATORVA_25 ) . Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in a dose-dependent improvement in whole body insulin sensitivity in both lean and fatty rats , with an approximately two-fold increase in glucose infusion rate and glucose disposal ( Rd ) in ATORVA_50 versus CONT ( p < 0.01 ) . DB01076 50mg/kg/day resulted in an increase in DB08831 ( 2-DOG ) uptake by skeletal muscles ( approximately two-fold increase in 2-DOG uptake in quadriceps ( p=0.06 ) and gastrocnemius ( p < 0.01 ) ) in lean Zucker rats . P01308 -stimulated phosphorylation of Akt/ P31749 was significantly increased in skeletal muscle of ATORVA_50 versus CONT in both lean and fatty rats . CONCLUSION : DB01076 induces insulin sensitization in Zucker lean and fatty rats . This may be a clinically important pleiotropic effect if confirmed in insulin resistant humans .
