Critical role of aquaporins in interleukin 1β ( IL-1β ) -induced inflammation . Rapid changes in cell volume characterize macrophage activation , but the role of water channels in inflammation remains unclear . We show here that , in vitro , aquaporin ( AQP ) blockade or deficiency results in reduced IL-1β release by macrophages activated with a variety of Q96P20 activators . Inhibition of AQP specifically during the regulatory volume decrease process is sufficient to limit IL-1β release by macrophages through the Q96P20 inflammasome axis . The immune-related activity of AQP was confirmed in vivo in a model of acute lung inflammation induced by crystals . P29972 deficiency is associated with a marked reduction of both lung IL-1β release and neutrophilic inflammation . We conclude that AQP-mediated water transport in macrophages constitutes a general danger signal required for Q96P20 -related inflammation . Our findings reveal a new function of AQP in the inflammatory process and suggest a novel therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory therapy .
