Activation of P00533 promotes squamous carcinoma SCC10A cell migration and invasion via inducing EMT-like phenotype change and P14780 -mediated degradation of P12830 . P00533 is a potent stimulator of invasion and metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) . However , the mechanism by which P00533 may stimulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis still need to be elucidated . In this study , we showed that activation of P00533 by P01133 in HNSCC cell line SCC10A enhanced cell migration and invasion , and induced loss of epitheloid phenotype in parallel with downregulation of P12830 and upregulation of P19022 and vimentin , indicating that P00533 promoted SCC10A cell migration and invasion possibly by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) -like phenotype change . Interestingly , activation of P00533 by P01133 induced production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) and soluble P12830 ( sE-cad ) , and knockdown of P14780 by siRNA inhibited sE-cad production induced by P01133 in SCC10A . Moreover , both P14780 knockdown and P12830 overexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion induced by P01133 in SCC10A . The results indicate that P00533 activation promoted cell migration and invasion through inducing P14780 -mediated degradation of P12830 into sE-cad . Pharmacologic inhibition of P00533 , MEK , and PI3K kinase activity in SCC10A reduced phosphorylated levels of P27361 /2 and AKT , production of P14780 and sE-cad , cell migration and invasion , and expressional changes of EMT markers ( P12830 and P19022 ) induced by P01133 , indicating that P00533 activation promotes cell migration and invasion via P27361 /2 and PI3K-regulated P14780 / P12830 signaling pathways . Taken together , the data suggest that P00533 activation promotes HNSCC SCC10A cell migration and invasion by inducing EMT-like phenotype change and P14780 -mediated degradation of P12830 into sE-cad related to activation of P27361 /2 and PI3K signaling pathways .
