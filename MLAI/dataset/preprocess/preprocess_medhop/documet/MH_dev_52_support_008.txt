Involvement of P05771 in PTH , P01375 , and P01584 effects on P05231 promoter in osteoblastic cells and on PTH-stimulated bone resorption . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) has been shown to be activated by parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in osteoblasts . Prior evidence suggests that this activation mediates responses leading to bone resorption , including production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) . However , the importance of specific PKC isozymes in this process has not been investigated . A selective antagonist of P05771 , LY379196 , was used to determine the role of the P05771 isozyme in the expression of P05231 in UMR-106 rat osteoblastic cells and in bone resorption in fetal rat limb bone organ cultures . PTH , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , and interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) induced translocation of P17252 and -beta(I) to the plasma membrane in UMR-106 cells within 5 min . The stimulation of P05771 (I) translocation by PTH , P01375 or P01584 was inhibited by LY379196 . In contrast , LY379196 did not affect PTH , P01375 - , or P01584 -stimulated translocation of P17252 . PTH , P01375 , and P01584 increased luciferase expression in UMR-106 cells transiently transfected with a -224/+11 bp P05231 promoter-driven reporter construct . The P05231 responses were also attenuated by treatment with LY379196 . Furthermore , LY379196 inhibited bone resorption elicited by PTH in fetal rat bone organ cultures . These results indicate that P05771 (I) is a component of the signaling pathway that mediates PTH- , P01375 - , and P01584 -stimulated P05231 expression and PTH-stimulated bone resorption .
