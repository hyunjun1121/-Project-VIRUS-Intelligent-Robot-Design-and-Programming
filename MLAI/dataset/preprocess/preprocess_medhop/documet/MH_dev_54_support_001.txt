Effect of dietary NaCl on tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglia of Dahl rats . To investigate the involvement of peripheral catecholamines in the development of Dahl-Iwai salt-sensitive ( Q8IX12 /Eis ) hypertension , we performed immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) in the superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) of Q8IX12 /Eis rats and Dahl-Iwai salt-resistant ( P30518 /Eis ) rats , and in situ hybridization histochemistry for demonstration of TH mRNA localization in the SCG of these rats . Q8IX12 /Eis and P30518 /Eis rats were fed on a high ( 8 % ) salt diet or on a low ( 0.3 % ) salt diet for 4 weeks . Nerve cells in the SCG of Q8IX12 /Eis high salt rats exhibited more intense TH-immunoreactivity ( P < 0.01 ) and hybridization signals ( P < 0.01 ) than those of the other experimental groups . These findings suggest that activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves may account for hypertension in Q8IX12 /Eis rats on a high salt diet .
