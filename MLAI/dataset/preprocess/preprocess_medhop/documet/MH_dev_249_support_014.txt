JTE-522 , a selective P35354 inhibitor , inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in RL95-2 cells . AIM : To investigate whether JTE-522 [ 4-(4-cyclohexyl-2-methyloxazol-5-yl)-2-fluorobenzenesulfonamide ] , a selective P35354 inhibitor , can induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation in human endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2 cells and to explore the molecular mechanisms . METHODS : [ 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) , DNA ladder , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , flow cytometry , RT-PCR , and Western blot analysis were employed to investigate effect of JTE-522 on human endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2 cells and the related molecular mechanisms . RESULTS : JTE-522 inhibited the growth of RL95-2 cells and induced the apoptosis . Furthermore , it arrested G0/ P55008 phase and inhibited S phase in RL95-2 cells . JTE-522 inhibited the expressions of P35354 mRNA , phosphorylated Rb , and P11802 proteins , while increased the levels of p53 , P38936 , cyclin D1 proteins , and the activity of caspase-3 in RL95-2 cells . CONCLUSION : JTE-522 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in RL95-2 cells , which may be associated with the activation of caspase-3-like proteases , down-regulation of the expression of P35354 mRNA , phosphorylated Rb , and P11802 proteins , and up-regulation of the expressions of p53 , P38936 , and cyclin D1 proteins .
