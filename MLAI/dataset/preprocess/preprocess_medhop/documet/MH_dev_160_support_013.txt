DB00065 treatment for refractory kawasaki disease in korean children . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : This was a multicenter study to evaluate the usefulness of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) blocker infliximab for treatment of Korean pediatric patients with refractory Kawasaki disease ( KD ) . SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Data from 16 patients throughout Korea who were diagnosed with refractory KD and received infliximab were collected retrospectively . RESULTS : Complete response to therapy with cessation of fever occurred in 13 of 16 patients . P02741 ( CRP ) concentrations decreased following infliximab infusion in all 14 patients in whom it was measured before and after treatment . There were no infusion reactions or complications associated with infliximab except in 1 case with acute hepatitis occurring during treatment followed by calculous cholecystitis 4 months later . Fifteen patients had coronary artery ( CA ) abnormalities before infliximab therapy . Three had transient mild dilatation and 9 had CA aneurysms , with subsequent normalization in 4 patients , persistent mild dilatation in 3 , persistent aneurysm in 2 , and there were 3 cases ( 2 with CA aneurysm , 1 with mild CA dilatation ) without follow-up echocardiography . CONCLUSION : The results of this study suggest that infliximab may be useful in the treatment of refractory KD , and it appears that there is no significant further progression of CA lesions developing after infliximab treatment . Multicenter trials with larger numbers of patients and long-term follow-up are necessary to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of infliximab in refractory KD .
