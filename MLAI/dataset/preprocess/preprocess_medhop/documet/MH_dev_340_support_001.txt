Effects of pravastatin on the expression of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 . In vitro inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase causes the suppression of liver X receptor ( LXR ) activity . Because LXR regulates the expression of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter ( DB01048 ) A1 , which is involved in the high-density lipoprotein-related reverse cholesterol transport pathway , we examined the effects of an P04035 inhibitor pravastatin on O95477 expression in vitro and in vivo . DB00175 ( 10 microM ) significantly reduced the transcript levels of murine O95477 gene by 35 % in RAW264.7 macrophages under a lipoprotein-deficient condition . The inhibition was due to the decreased mevalonic acid production because addition of exogenous mevalonic acid restored O95477 mRNA levels . In addition , cholesterol and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol thoroughly blunted the inhibition . Furthermore , pravastatin did not decrease O95477 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 hepatocytes even in the absence of exogenous LXR agonists . Oral dosing of pravastatin ( 0.1 % concentration in drinking water ) for 24 h or 2 weeks to mice did not decrease O95477 mRNA and protein levels in the liver and leukocytes . Interestingly , pravastatin significantly increased both hepatic and leukocyte LXRalpha mRNA levels . Thus , although P04035 inhibitors suppress O95477 mRNA expression in the absence of LXR agonists , in vivo inhibition of P04035 is unlikely to cause such suppression .
