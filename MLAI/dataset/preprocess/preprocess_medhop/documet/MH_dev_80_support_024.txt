A Patient with HIV Treated with DB06186 and Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Melanoma Metastases to the Brain . Cancers , such as melanoma , that are associated with immune deficiencies are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients . Once patients develop melanoma metastases to the brain , treatment is often limited to palliative surgery and/or radiation . DB06186 , a P16410 antagonist , has been shown to improve the median survival of patients with metastatic melanoma . However , available data regarding the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in HIV-infected patients who develop intracranial melanoma metastases is limited . Here we report our experience administering ipilimumab to a patient with HIV-AIDS who developed multiple intracranial melanoma metastases . Following treatment , our patient showed improvement in systemic tumor control without any apparent interference with antiretroviral treatment .
