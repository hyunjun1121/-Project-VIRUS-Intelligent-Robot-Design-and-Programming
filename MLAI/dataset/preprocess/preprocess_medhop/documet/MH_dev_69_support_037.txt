Nonlinkage of bipolar illness to tyrosine hydroxylase , tyrosinase , and D2 and D4 dopamine receptor genes on chromosome 11 . OBJECTIVE : Previous linkage and allelic association studies using DNA polymorphisms , cosegregation of cytogenetic abnormalities with psychiatric illness , and assignment of genes involved in neutotransmitter metabolism suggested that chromosome 11 may harbor a gene predisposing to bipolar illness . The authors examined linkage in the families of 14 probands with bipolar illness , with the candidate genes tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) , D4 dopamine receptor ( P21917 ) at 11p15 , tyrosinase ( P14679 ) at 11q14-q21 , and D2 dopamine receptor ( P14416 ) at 11q22-q23 , as well as with the c-Harvey-ras oncogene ( P01112 ) and insulin gene ( P01308 ) , both located at 11p15 , a region that previously showed linkage to bipolar illness . METHOD : The genetic data were analyzed with both lod score analysis ( parametric ) and affected-sib-pair analysis ( nonparametric ) ; both narrow and broad definitions of the clinical phenotype were used . Further influences of diagnostic uncertainties were accounted for by using diagnostic probability classes weighing the stability of each phenotype . RESULTS : Two-point linkage results excluded close linkage of bipolar illness to each candidate gene ; negative results were also obtained when the narrow definition of the clinical phenotype was used . Moreover , multipoint linkage analysis of P01112 and P01308 excluded the 11p15 region encompassing both P21917 and TH . In agreement with the negative linkage results , affected-sib-pair analysis did not show preferential sharing of marker alleles at any of the candidate genes . CONCLUSIONS : The negative results obtained under different genetic models exclude a frequent role for P21917 , TH , P14679 , and P14416 in the pathogenesis of bipolar illness .
