Chronic daily tadalafil prevents the corporal fibrosis and veno-occlusive dysfunction that occurs after cavernosal nerve resection . OBJECTIVES : To determine whether a long-term single daily oral dose of a longer half-life phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor , tadalafil , has a similar effect to that of the shorter half-life O76074 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil , and can prevent the fibrosis and resultant corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction ( CVOD ) occurring after cavernosal nerve ( CN ) injury . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Male rats ( 10 per group ) had either a sham operation , unilateral CN resection ( P21554 ) or bilateral P21554 , and were left untreated or given retrolingually 5 mg/kg per day of tadalafil . After 45 days , CVOD was assessed via cavernosometry , and the underlying corporal tissue changes were examined by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry ( followed by quantitative image analysis ) , Western blots , and ad hoc methods . RESULTS : DB00820 treatment normalized the low response to papaverine and high drop rate in the intracavernosal pressure measured by cavernosometry after P21554 compared with sham-operated rats . DB00820 also normalized the increase in penile shaft collagen content , and the reduction in corporal smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) content , SMC/collagen , and replication index , and improved the lower collagen III/I ratio and the increase in apoptotic index , caused by P21554 , compared with sham operation . There were no effects of tadalafil on increased transforming growth factor beta1 , inducible nitric oxide synthase and xanthine oxidoreductase levels . CONCLUSIONS : A long-term single daily dose of tadalafil prevented CVOD and the underlying corporal fibrosis in the rat caused by CN damage , as effectively as the previously reported continuous treatment with vardenafil or sildenafil , through a cGMP-related mechanism that appears to be independent of inducible nitric oxide synthase induction .
