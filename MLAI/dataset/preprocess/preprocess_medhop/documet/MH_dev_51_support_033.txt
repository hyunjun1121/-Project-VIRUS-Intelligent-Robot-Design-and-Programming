Effect of Q13315 , O96017 and P04626 TAGSNPs and haplotypes on endometrial cancer risk . Family history of endometrial cancer increases the risk of developing the disease , but it is still largely unknown which germ-line genetic factors are involved in the aetiology of endometrial cancer . In a Swedish population-based case-control study including 705 cases and 1565 controls , we examined common variation in the Q13315 , O96017 and P04626 genes in relation to endometrial cancer risk overall , restricted to tumours of certain characteristics or stratified by various endometrial cancer risk factors . We genotyped a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the genes and selected seven haplotype-tagging SNPs ( tagSNPs ) in Q13315 , six tagSNPs in O96017 and seven tagSNPs in P04626 that could predict common variants and haplotypes ( frequency > or =0.03 ) in each gene with R(2) > or = 0.8 . We included the tagSNPs or their haplotypes as explanatory variables in unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for age . Our results indicated an increased risk of developing endometroid endometrial cancer for homozygous carriers of the rare allele ( AA ) of a tagSNP ( rs4987886 ) in O96017 ( P = 0.005 ) when contrasted with GG carriers . We also found a decreased endometrial cancer risk among non-smoking carriers of a haplotype in Q13315 ( P = 0.0007 ) and among carriers of a haplotype in O96017 , who had experienced menopause below 49 years of age ( P = 0.0009 ) compared with non-carriers of these haplotypes . We found no effect of genetic variation in P04626 on endometrial cancer risk . In conclusion , it is possible that common variants in the Q13315 and O96017 genes , in interaction with oestrogen-related exposures , are involved in endometrial cancer aetiology .
