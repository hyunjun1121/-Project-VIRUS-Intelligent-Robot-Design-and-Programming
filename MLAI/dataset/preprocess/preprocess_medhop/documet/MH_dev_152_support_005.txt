[ The effect of blood pressure-reducing therapy with captopril on tubular marker excretion in type-1 diabetics with nephropathy ] . A prospective open clinical trial was carried out with 23 hypertensive type I diabetics ( 13 men , ten women , mean age 49 +/- 9.1 years , duration of diabetes 18 +/- 9.1 years ) with early nephropathy . Glomerular and tubular renal function and metabolic parameters were monitored during 8 months ' treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , captopril , in addition to previous antihypertensive treatment with one or more drugs . Blood pressure control tended to improve on captopril ( systolic pressures 152 +/- 13 vs 140 +/- 13 mm Hg , P < 0.05 ; diastolic pressures 89 +/- 10 vs 87 +/- 10 mm Hg , not significant ) . Proteinuria ( > 0.5 g/24 hours ) fell into the microalbuminuria range ( albumin excretion 2-20 mg/mmol creatinine ) in four out of 13 patients , and microalbuminuria disappeared in four out of ten patients . Urinary levels of the brush border enzyme O60502 ( NAG ) , a marker of tubular dysfunction , were initially raised and fell significantly after 8 months ' treatment with captopril ( 20.3 +/- 14.4 vs 8.8 +/- 8.1 U/g creatinine ; P < 0.01 ) . DB01197 did not affect metabolic control ( HbA1 , total , HDL and LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , apolipoproteins A1 and B ) or the insulin dosage . These results show that long-term treatment with captopril may favourably influence both albumin excretion and NAG activity , a marker of tubular dysfunction , in type I diabetics with nephropathy .
