Genetic deletion of P01375 receptor suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission via reducing AMPA receptor synaptic localization in cortical neurons . The distribution of postsynaptic glutamate receptors has been shown to be regulated by proimmunocytokine tumor necrosis factor α ( P01375 -α ) signaling . The role of P01375 -α receptor subtypes in mediating glutamate receptor expression , trafficking , and function still remains unclear . Here , we report that P01375 receptor subtypes ( P19438 and P20333 ) differentially modulate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor ( AMPAR ) clustering and function in cultured cortical neurons . We find that genetic deletion of P19438 decreases surface expression and synaptic localization of the AMPAR P42261 subunit , reduces the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current ( mEPSC ) , and reduces AMPA-induced maximal whole-cell current . In addition , these results are not observed in P20333 -deleted neurons . The decreased AMPAR expression and function in P19438 -deleted cells are not significantly restored by short ( 2 h ) or long ( 24 h ) term exposure to P01375 -α . In P20333 -deleted cells , P01375 -α promotes AMPAR trafficking to the synapse and increases mEPSC frequency . In the present study , we find no significant change in the Q05586 subunit of NMDAR clusters , location , and mEPSC . This includes applying or withholding the P01375 -α treatment in both P19438 - and P20333 -deleted neurons . Our results indicate that P01375 receptor subtype 1 but not 2 plays a critical role in modulating AMPAR clustering , suggesting that targeting P19438 gene might be a novel approach to preventing neuronal AMPAR-mediated excitotoxicity .
