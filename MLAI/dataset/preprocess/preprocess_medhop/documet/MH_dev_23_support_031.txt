DB00104 prevents growth factor-induced proliferation of bovine retinal endothelial cells under hypoxia . Ocular diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy are the major cause of blindness in industrialized countries . The main pathologic features of these diseases are hypoxia and overproduction of growth factors resulting in pathologic proliferation of endothelial cells and new vessel formation . Particularly , hypoxia and growth factors , such as P15692 , DB01277 , P09038 and TGF beta(2) , show a complex interaction in the onset and progression of the diseases . Therefore , to date , most therapeutic strategies for proliferative retinopathies have targeted proliferation of endothelial cells evoked by growth factors . Recently , a synthetic analog of somatostatin , octreotide , has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cells in vitro , including endothelial cells . In this study , we have investigated the proliferative response of bovine retinal endothelial cells ( BREC ) to growth factors under hypoxic conditions and the modulation by octreotide . We found a dose-dependent increase of cell proliferation with P15692 , DB01277 and P09038 , and inhibition of hypoxia-induced cell proliferation with TGF beta(2) . Moreover , growth factor-induced , but not hypoxia-induced , cell proliferation was attenuated in the presence of octreotide . In contrast , TGF beta(2) abolished hypoxia-induced BREC proliferation . Similar to octreotide BIM23027 , a somatastatin receptor subtype 2 ( P30874 ) receptor agonist was able to attenuate the growth factor-induced proliferation of BREC expressing mRNA and protein for P30874 . Therefore , we postulate that octreotide exerts its effects mainly through binding to the P30874 . Taken together , our findings point to octreotide as a promising candidate for the treatment of eye disorders involving growth factor-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells .
