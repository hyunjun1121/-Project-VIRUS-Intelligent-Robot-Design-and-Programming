Cbl-b is a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokines produced by IgE-activated mast cells . c-Cbl and Cbl-b E3 ubiquitin ligases are abundantly expressed in hemopoietic cells where they negatively regulate the activity and levels of many cell surface receptors and associated signaling molecules . By comparing bone marrow-derived mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice it has recently been shown that Cbl-b is the dominant family member for negatively regulating signaling responses from high-affinity IgE receptors . In this study , we suggest that a possible reason for the greater enhancement of IgE receptor signaling in Cbl-b-deficient mice is the relatively higher levels of Cbl-b protein over c-Cbl in mast cells compared with other hemopoietic cells . We also directly compare mast cells from c-Cbl and Cbl-b-deficient mice and find that loss of Cbl-b , but not c-Cbl , increases cell growth , retards receptor internalization , and causes the sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its substrates . However , loss of Cbl-b does not enhance the activation of P29323 or Akt , nor does it promote a greater calcium response . Furthermore , loss of Cbl-b or c-Cbl does not increase levels of the Syk or Lyn protein tyrosine kinases . Most notable , however , is the extremely large increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines P01375 , P05231 , and P13500 by Cbl-b(-/-) mast cells compared with levels produced by c-Cbl(-/-) or wild-type cells . This marked induction , which appears to be restricted to these three cytokines , is dependent on IgE receptor activation and correlates with enhanced O15111 phosphorylation . Thus , Cbl-b functions as a potent negative regulator of cytokines that promote allergic and inflammatory reactions .
