Common variants of P29474 and P18887 genes may predict acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery . PURPOSE : To evaluate the impact of functional polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair mechanisms ( P18887 , P04637 , P43246 , P20585 , P18074 ) , oxidative stress response ( P09211 , P08263 , P29474 , P04179 ) and fibroblast proliferation ( TGFβ1 ) on the risk of acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Skin toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria in 286 breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery . Genotyping was conducted by PCR-RFLP analysis and real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood . RESULTS : In the multivariate analysis , nominally significant associations , before multiple testing corrections , were found between P18887 T-77C ( T carriers vs. CC , OR : 2.240 , 95 % CI : 1.015-4.941 , P=0.046 ) , P29474 G894T polymorphisms ( TT vs. G carriers , OR : 2.473 , 95 % CI : 1.220-5.012 , P=0.012 ) , breast diameter ( OR : 1.138 , 95 % CI : 1.001-1.293 , P=0.048 ) , boost dose-fractionation ( 3 Gy vs. no boost , OR : 4.902 , 95 % CI : 1.458-16.483 , P=0.010 ) and ≥ grade 2 acute radiation skin toxicity in breast cancer patients . CONCLUSIONS : As our exploratory study suggests that P18887 T-77C and P29474 G874T may confer an increased risk of acute skin reactions to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients , further confirmatory studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance .
