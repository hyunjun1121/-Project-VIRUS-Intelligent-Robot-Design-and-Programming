DB01411 inhibits renal epithelial cyst progression via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase . Q9Y271 ( CysLT1 receptor ) antagonists were found to inhibit chloride secretion in human airway epithelial cells . Since chloride secretion in renal epithelial cells , which shares common mechanisms with airway epithelial cells , plays important roles in renal cyst progression in polycystic kidney disease ( Q15139 ) , this study was aimed to investigate effects of drugs acting as CysLT1 receptor antagonists on renal cyst progression and its underlying mechanisms . Effects of CysLT1 receptor antagonists on renal cyst growth and formation were determined using Madine Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cyst models . Mechanisms of actions of CysLT1 receptor antagonists were determined using short-circuit current measurement , assays of cell viability and cell proliferation , and immunoblot analysis of signaling proteins . Of the three drugs acting as CysLT1 receptor antagonists ( montelukast , pranlukast and zafirlukast ) tested , pranlukast was the most promising drug that inhibited MDCK cyst growth and formation without affecting cell viability . Its effect was independent of the inhibition of CysLT1 receptors . Instead , it reduced DB02527 -activated chloride secretion and proliferation of MDCK cells in an AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) -dependent manner and had no effect on P13569 protein expression . Interestingly , pranlukast enhanced AMPK activation via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta ( CaMKKβ ) with consequent activation of acetyl- DB01992 carboxylase ( ACC ) and suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway . These results indicate that pranlukast retards renal epithelial cyst progression by inhibiting DB02527 -activated chloride secretion and cell proliferation via CaMKKβ-AMPK- P42345 pathway . Therefore , pranlukast represents a class of known drugs that may have potential utility in Q15139 treatment .
