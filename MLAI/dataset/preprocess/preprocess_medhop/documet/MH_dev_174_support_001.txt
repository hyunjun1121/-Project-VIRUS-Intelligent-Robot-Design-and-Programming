Novel splice variants of the bovine P35558 gene . DB01819 carboxykinase 1 ( P35558 ) , also named P35558 , is a multiple-function gene that is involved in gluconeogenesis , glyceroneogenesis , reproduction , female fertility , and development of obesity and diabetes . How its many functions are regulated was largely unknown . Therefore , we investigated mRNA expression and possible splice variants of P35558 by screening cDNA in nine tissues from Holstein bulls and cows . P35558 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver , kidney , ovary and testis ; expression levels were low in the heart , spleen , and lung tissues . Expression of this gene was not detected in skeletal muscle . This led to the discovery of five novel bovine splice variants , named P35558 -AS1- P35558 -AS5 . In P35558 -AS1 , 51 nucleotides in the interior of exon 2 were spliced out . In P35558 -AS2 , exons 2 and 3 were altered by the alternative 3' and 5' splice sites , respectively . P35558 - Q9NTI5 was truncated from the 3' end of exon 2 to the 5' end of exon 4 . In P35558 -AS4 , exon 5 was completely spliced out . In P35558 -AS5 , exons 5 and 6 and the 5' end of exon 7 were spliced out . These splice variants ( P35558 -AS1- P35558 -AS5 ) potentially encoded shorter proteins ( 605 , 546 , 373 , 246 and 274 amino acids , respectively ) , when compared to the complete protein ( 622 amino acids ) . Considering the functional domains of the P35558 protein , it is likely that these splice variants considerably affect the function of this protein ; alternative splicing could be one of the mechanisms by which the diverse functions of P35558 are regulated .
