Neuroprotection of geniposide against hydrogen peroxide induced PC12 cells injury : involvement of P19957 kinase signal pathway . AIM : Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenic cascade leading to neuronal degeneration in AD . Consequently , the induction of endogenous antioxidative proteins by antioxidants seems to be a very reasonable strategy for delaying the disease 's progression . In previous work , we identified the neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of geniposide , which result from the activation of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ( P43220 ) . In this study , we explore the role of P19957 kinase signaling pathway in the neuroprotection of geniposide in PC12 cells . METHODS : Cell viability was determined by MTT assay . Apoptosis was detected by Hoechst and PI double staining . The protein expression of Bcl-2 and phosphorylation of Akt308 , Akt473 , GSK-3beta , and PDK1 was measured by Western blot . RESULTS : Geniposide induced the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 , which inhibited apoptosis in PC12 cells induced by H(2)O(2) , and this effect could be inhibited by preincubation with LY294002 , a selective inhibitor of PI3K . Furthermore , geniposide enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt308 , Akt473 , GSK-3beta and PDK1 under conditions of oxidative stress . CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate that the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in the neuroprotection of geniposide in PC12 cells against the oxidative damage induced by H(2)O(2) in PC12 cells .
