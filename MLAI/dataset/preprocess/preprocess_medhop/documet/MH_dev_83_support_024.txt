Approach to angiogenesis inhibition based on cyclooxygenase-2 . Two cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) isoforms have been identified : P23219 and P35354 . P23219 is the constitutively expressed form of the enzyme and is ubiquitous in its distribution . P35354 is inducible and is present in inflammatory foci , tumors , and neovasculature . Expression of P35354 appears to be important in tumor promotion , growth , and metastasis . It is up-regulated in a variety of premalignant disorders and malignancies . P36551 inhibitors have a major role in the treatment of inflammation and pain . Epidemiologic evidence in patients who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs links P36551 inhibition with decreases in malignant esophageal , stomach , colon , lung , and breast tumors . Nonselective P36551 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in control of familial adenomatous polyposis , a disorder associated with the development of thousands of benign intestinal polyps . The selective P35354 inhibitor celecoxib ( DB00482 , Pharmacia ) has been shown to reduce the number of adenomatous colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis as an adjunct to usual care . Celecoxib has recently been approved for this indication and offers the potential for equivalent or greater efficacy than that seen with nonselective P36551 inhibitors but without the gastrointestinal mucosal toxicity and the inhibition of platelet function associated with those agents . Angiogenesis is a feature of both benign and malignant disease . Because P35354 is up-regulated in the neovasculature of the rheumatoid pannus and in malignant tumors and their surrounding stroma , selective P35354 inhibitors may be able to modify the progression of these disorders through the control of angiogenesis .
