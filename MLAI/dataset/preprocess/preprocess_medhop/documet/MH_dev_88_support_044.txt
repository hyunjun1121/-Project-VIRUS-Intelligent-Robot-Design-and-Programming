DB01259 induces apoptosis in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells : effects on insulin-like growth factor I signaling . The majority of breast cancer patients who achieve an initial therapeutic response to the P04626 -targeted antibody trastuzumab will show disease progression within 1 year . Thus , the identification of novel agents that effectively inhibit survival of cancer cells that have progressed on trastuzumab is critical . In the current study , we show that the dual epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) /human P00533 -2 ( P04626 ) kinase inhibitor lapatinib induces apoptosis in trastuzumab-resistant cells derived from the P04626 -overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer line . DB01259 inhibited P00533 and P04626 signaling in resistant cells , blocking activation of downstream Akt , mitogen-activated protein kinase [ corrected ] Importantly , lapatinib also inhibited insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) signaling and growth-promoting effects in parental and resistant cells , and the cytotoxic effects of lapatinib were further enhanced by the P08069 -blocking antibody alphaIR3 . As increased P08069 signaling has been implicated in trastuzumab resistance , our data strongly support further study of lapatinib as a potential therapeutic in breast cancers that have progressed on trastuzumab .
