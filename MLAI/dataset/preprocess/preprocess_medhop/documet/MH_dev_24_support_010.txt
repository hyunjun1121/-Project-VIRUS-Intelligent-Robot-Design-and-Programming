Sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating mutations of the P36888 receptor . Activating mutations of P36888 have been detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Two distinct types of P36888 mutations are most common : internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) of sequences coding for the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations at codon 835 ( Asp835 ) within the kinase domain . Both types of mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase activity of P36888 in experimental systems and result in factor-independent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 and 32D cells . Recently , novel mutations within the activation loop were identified in patients with AML : deletion of isoleucine 836 ( Ile836del ) and an exchange of isoleucine 836 to methionine plus an arginine insertion ( Ile836Met+ DB00125 ) . To examine whether the Ile836 mutations result in constitutive activation of the P36888 receptor , we introduced both mutant P36888 cDNAs transiently into P29320 293 cells . Both mutant P36888 receptors were constitutively autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand and kinase activity led to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades as determined by activation of the P42229 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ) pathway . When stably expressed in the growth factor-dependent cell lines Ba/ P13726 and 32D , both deletion and insertion mutants led to factor-independent proliferation , indicating that both mutants have transforming capabilities . We then examined the sensitivity of the P36888 ITD , P36888 Asp835Tyr , and the novel P36888 receptor mutants toward the kinase inhibitors AG1296 , PKC412 , and SU5614 . We show that these P36888 kinase inhibitors have distinct inhibitory potencies against different activating P36888 receptor mutants . These results suggest that it may be useful to determine the exact kind of P36888 mutation when applying receptor kinase inhibitors in clinical trials .
