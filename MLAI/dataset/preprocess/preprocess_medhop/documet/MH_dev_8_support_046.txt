Valproic acid suppresses cervical cancer tumor progression possibly via activating Notch1 signaling and enhances receptor-targeted cancer chemotherapeutic via activating somatostatin receptor type II . PURPOSE : We investigated the effects of the anti-epilepsy drug valproic acid ( DB00313 ) alone and in combination in treating cervical cancer . METHODS : DB00313 was investigated for its effects on cervical cancer Hela cell proliferation and tumor growth via in vitro and in vivo assays . RESULTS : DB00313 induce cell growth suppression and cell cycle arrest , with an increase of Notch1 that acts as a tumor suppressor and the change of other tumor-associated genes such as P38936 , p63 and P12004 . DB00313 was also found to induce cell morphological change , with an increase of certain cell transformation markers such as snail1 , snail2 and P19022 . Moreover , DB00313 could significantly up-regulate somatostatin receptor type II ( P30874 ) . Our in vivo study further demonstrated that DB00313 via inducing P30874 up-regulation extremely enhanced the anti-tumor ability of the P30874 -preferential cytotoxic COL- P61278 conjugate in xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : DB00313 could not only suppress tumor progression but also provide a novel promising therapeutic choice in combination with a receptor-targeted cytotoxic conjugate via activating the specific receptor .
