Xaliproden ( SR57746A ) induces P08908 receptor-mediated Q96HU1 kinase activation in PC12 cells . Neurotrophic growth factors are involved in cell survival . However , natural growth factors have a very limited therapeutic use because of their short half-life . In the present study , we investigated the mechanism of action of a non-peptidic neurotrophic drug , Xaliproden , a potential molecule for the treatment of motoneuron diseases , since the transduction pathways of this synthetic P08908 agonist are very poorly understood . Xaliproden does not activate the Trk receptor but causes a rapid increase in the activities of the P27361 and P28482 isoforms of Q96HU1 kinase , which then rapidly decrease to the basal level . We demonstrate that isoforms of the P29353 adapter protein are phosphorylated independently of each other and are probably not the source of the Xaliproden-induced Q96HU1 kinases activation . The inhibitor of Ras farnesylation , FPT-1 , and the protein kinase C inhibitors , GF 109203X and chelerythrine , inhibited the Xaliproden-induced Q96HU1 kinase activation , suggesting p21Ras and PKC involvement . Moreover , the observations that the P08908 antagonist , pindobind , and pertussis toxin abolished the Xaliproden-induced P29323 stimulation suggested that Xaliproden activates the Q96HU1 kinase pathways by stimulating the G protein-coupled receptor , P08908 . These results demonstrate clearly that the non-peptidic compound , Xaliproden , exerts its neurotrophic effects through a mechanism of action differing from that of neurotrophins . These findings suggest that this compound does not involve MAPK activation by TrkA receptor stimulation but acts by Q96HU1 kinase pathway by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism involving P08908 receptors , P38936 Ras and MEK-1 and by PKC and Akt pathways .
