Agonist selectivity for three species of natriuretic peptide receptor-A . We determined the nucleotide sequence of mouse natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) cDNA and compared the revised deduced amino acid sequence with those of rat and human P16066 . The ligand selectivity of these three receptor/guanylyl cyclases was examined by whole-cell stimulation of cGMP production . The 28-amino acid atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) has only one difference among these three species , i.e. , human DB00134 -12 versus rat and mouse DB00167 -12 . However , despite the nearly invariant P01160 sequence among these species , P01160 analogs have marked differences in ED50 values and maximal cGMP responses among the three receptors . With the natriuretic peptide analogs we tested , human P16066 is less sensitive than rat or mouse P16066 to changes in the 17-amino acid , disulfide-bonded ring of P01160 and to the species differences in brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) but is more sensitive to deletions in the carboxyl tail of P01160 . The P01160 determinants of agonist potency have therefore changed for different species of P16066 . This is reflected in the amino acid sequence divergence in the receptor extracellular domains and in the divergence and specificity of DB04899 among species . Our results suggest that the coevolution of P16066 and DB04899 has thus been constrained within the context of the conserved P01160 sequence .
