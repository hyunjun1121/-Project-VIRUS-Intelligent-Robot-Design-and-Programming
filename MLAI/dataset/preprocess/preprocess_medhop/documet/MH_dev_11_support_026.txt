Functional characterization of vasopressin receptor 2 mutations causing partial and complete congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in Thai families . BACKGROUND : P30518 mutations cause most cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) ; 211 P30518 mutations have been described , but only 7 are described causing partial NDI . METHODS : Two unrelated Thai boys had polyuria and polydipsia in infancy but had normal electrolytes and serum osmolality at 2 years of age . Patient 1 could not concentrate his urine in response to water deprivation or 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin ( DB00035 ) ; patient 2 could concentrate to approximately 600 mosm/l . The patients ' P30518 genes were sequenced and the identified mutations were re-created in P30518 cDNA expression vectors . P30518 activities were measured by stimulating transfected HEK293T cells with arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) or DB00035 , and assessing the resulting DB02527 production by the activation of a luciferase reporter . RESULTS : Patient 1 carried the previously described missense mutation R181C ; patient 2 carried the novel missense mutation M311V . When transiently transfected into HEK293T cells , 6.8 x 10(-12) M AVP induced the half-maximal response ( EC50 ) of the wild-type , whereas the EC50 value for R181C was 5.9 x 10(-9) M and for M311V was 2.6 x 10(-10)M . Responses to DB00035 were qualitatively similar but required 10-fold higher concentrations . CONCLUSION : The novel P30518 mutation M311V retains partial activity and results in a milder form of NDI .
