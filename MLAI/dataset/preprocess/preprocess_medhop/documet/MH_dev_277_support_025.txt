P01375 inhibits flow and insulin signaling leading to NO production in aortic endothelial cells . Endothelial cells release nitric oxide ( NO ) acutely in response to increased " flow " or fluid shear stress ( FSS ) , and the increase in NO production is correlated with enhanced phosphorylation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) . Both vascular endothelial growth factor and FSS activate endothelial protein kinase B ( P31749 ) by way of incompletely understood pathway(s) , and , in turn , P31749 phosphorylates P29474 at DB00133 -1179 , causing its activation . In this study , we found that either FSS or insulin stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 ( P35568 ) tyrosine and serine phosphorylation and increased P35568 -associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity , phosphorylation of P31749 DB00133 -473 , phosphorylation of P29474 DB00133 -1179 , and NO production . Brief pretreatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) inhibited the above described FSS- or insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation events and almost totally inhibited FSS- or insulin-stimulated NO production . These data indicate that FSS and insulin regulate P29474 phosphorylation and NO production by overlapping mechanisms . This study suggests one potential mechanism for the development of endothelial dysfunction in disease states with alterations in insulin regulation and increased P01375 levels .
