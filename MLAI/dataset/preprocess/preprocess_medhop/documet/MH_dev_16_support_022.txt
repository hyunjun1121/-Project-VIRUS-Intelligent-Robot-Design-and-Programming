The novel synthetic retinoid 6-[3-adamantyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid ( CD437 ) causes apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells through rapid activation of caspases . The synthetic retinoid 6-[3-adamantyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid ( CD437 ) , which was originally developed as an retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -gamma agonist , induces rapid apoptosis in all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) -sensitive and DB00755 -resistant clones of the NB4 cell line , a widely used experimental model of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . In addition , the compound is apoptogenic in primary cultures of freshly isolated APL blasts obtained from a newly diagnosed case and an DB00755 -resistant relapsed patient . NB4 cells in the S-phase of the cycle are most sensitive to CD437-triggered apoptosis . CD437-dependent apoptosis does not require de novo protein synthesis and activation of P13631 or any of the other nuclear retinoic acid receptors . The process is preceded by rapid activation of a caspase-like enzymatic activity capable of cleaving the fluorogenic DEVD but not the fluorogenic YVAD tetrapeptide . Increased caspase activity correlates with caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation . Inhibition of caspases by z-VAD suppresses the nuclear DNA degradation observed in NB4 cells treated with CD437 , as well as the degradation of pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-7 . CD437-dependent activation of caspases is preceded by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol of treated cells . Leakage of cytochrome c lays upstream of caspase activation , because the phenomenon is left unaffected by pretreatment of NB4 cells with z-VAD . Treatment of APL cells with CD437 is associated with a caspase-dependent degradation of promyelocytic leukemia- P10276 , which can be completely inhibited by z-VAD .
