Effect of prototypical inducing agents on P-glycoprotein and CYP3A expression in mouse tissues . P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) and CYP3A have considerable overlap in inducers in vitro . Characterizing P-gp induction in vivo and potential coregulation with CYP3A are important goals for predicting drug interactions . This study examined P-gp expression in mouse tissues and potential coinduction with CYP3A following oral treatment with 1 of 7 prototypical inducing agents for 5 days . P-gp expression in brain or liver was not induced by any treatment as determined by Western blot , whereas dexamethasone , pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile ( Q15149 ) , St . John 's wort ( SJW ) , and rifampin induced hepatic CYP3A expression . In intestine , rifampin and SJW induced P-gp expression 3.7- and 1.6-fold and CYP3A 3.5- and 2.4-fold , respectively , whereas dexamethasone and Q15149 induced CYP3A only . These observations suggest that P-gp in mouse small intestine is inducible by some , but not all , CYP3A inducers , whereas P-gp expression in liver or brain is not readily induced . Intriguingly , rifampin and SJW , both activators of the human pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) , induced CYP3A in both liver and intestine but induced P-gp only in intestine , whereas Q15149 , an activator of murine O75469 , did not induce P-gp in any tissue . DB01045 disposition was evaluated , and hepatic exposure to rifampin was comparable to intestine ; in contrast , brain concentrations were low . Overall , these observations demonstrate that P-gp induction in vivo is tissue-specific ; furthermore , there is a disconnect between P-gp induction and CYP3A induction that is tissue- and inducer-dependent , suggesting that O75469 activation alone is insufficient for P-gp induction in vivo . Tissue-specific factors and inducer pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties may underlie these observations .
