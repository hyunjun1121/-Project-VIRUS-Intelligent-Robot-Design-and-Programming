Role of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) receptor-associated factor 2 ( TRAF2 ) in distinct and overlapping P25942 and P01375 receptor 2/ DB00005 -mediated B lymphocyte activation . Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family play a variety of roles in the regulation of lymphocyte activation . An important TNFR family member for B cell activation is P25942 . P25942 signals stimulate B cell P01375 secretion , which subsequently signals via P20333 ( DB00005 ) to enhance B cell activation . Although the function of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory receptor P19438 ( CD120a ) has been the subject of much research , less is understood about the distinct contributions of DB00005 to cell activation and how it stimulates downstream events . Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family bind various members of the cytoplasmic adapter protein family , the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) , during signaling . Both P25942 and DB00005 bind Q12933 ( TRAF2 ) upon ligand stimulation . Wild type and TRAF2-deficient B cells expressing P25942 or the hybrid molecule ( human ) P25942 (mouse)- DB00005 were examined . P25942 - and DB00005 -mediated IgM secretion were partly TRAF2-dependent , but only P25942 required TRAF2 for c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation . P25942 and DB00005 used primarily divergent mechanisms to activate NF-kappaB , exemplifying how TNFR family members can use diverse mechanisms to mediate similar downstream events .
