Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 40 candidate genes for gene-environment studies on cancer : data from population-based Japanese random samples . Knowledge of genetic polymorphisms in gene-environment studies may contribute to more accurate identification of avoidable risks and to developing tailor-made preventative measures . The aim of this study was to describe the allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of select genes , which may be included in future gene-environment studies on cancer in Japan . SNP typing was performed on middle-aged Japanese men randomly selected from the general population in five areas of Japan . We genotyped and calculated allele frequencies of 153 SNPs located on 40 genes : P04798 , Q16678 , P11712 , P33261 , P05181 , P05093 , P11511 , P35869 , P03372 , Q92731 , ERRRG , P06401 , P07099 , P34913 , P37059 , P37058 , P28161 , P21266 , GSTT2 , P09211 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P21964 , P07327 , P00325 , P00326 , P05091 , P35228 , NOS3 , P01583 , P01584 , O15527 , P36639 [ P36639 ] , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , P31645 , P04150 [ GCCR ] , P42898 , and P15559 . In the present study , the Japanese allele frequencies were verified by using nationwide population samples .
