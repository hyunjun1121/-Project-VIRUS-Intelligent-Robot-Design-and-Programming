Characterization of rat P23510 by monoclonal antibody . OX40 ( CD134 ) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) receptor superfamily first identified as a rat T cell activation marker . We previously identified the rat ligand for OX40 ( P23510 ) by molecular cloning . In the present study , we newly generated an anti-rat P23510 mAb ( Q13315 -2 ) that can inhibit the binding of OX40 to rat P23510 and thus efficiently inhibits the T cell costimulatory activity of rat P23510 . Flow cytometric analyses using Q13315 -2 and an anti-rat OX40 mAb ( MRC OX40 ) indicated that OX40 was inducible on splenic P01730 (+) T cells by stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb , while P23510 was not expressed on resting or activated T cells . P23510 was expressed on splenic B cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , but not on peritoneal macrophages . Interestingly , splenic dendritic cells ( DC ) expressed P23510 constitutively , which was further upregulated by LPS stimulation . The potent costimulatory activities of splenic DC for anti-CD3-stimulated rat P01730 (+) T cell proliferation and cytokine ( P60568 , P01579 , P22301 , and P35225 ) production were substantially inhibited by Q13315 -2 . These results indicated that P23510 is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells ( P25054 ) , and may be involved in humoral immune responses via T-B interaction and in cellular immune responses via T-DC interaction in the rat system .
