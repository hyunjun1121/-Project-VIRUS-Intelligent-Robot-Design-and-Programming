O60315 mediates multiple pathways regulating cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and apoptosis in glioma . BACKGROUND : The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of Zinc finger E-box Binding homeobox 2 ( O60315 ) in glioma and to explore the molecular mechanisms of O60315 that regulate cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and apoptosis . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Expression of O60315 in 90 clinicopathologically characterized glioma patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry . Furthermore , siRNA targeting O60315 was transfected into U251 and U87 glioma cell lines in vitro and proliferation , migration , invasion , and apoptosis were examined separately by MTT assay , Transwell chamber assay , flow cytometry , and western blot . RESULTS : The expression level of O60315 protein was significantly increased in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues ( P < 0.001 ) . In addition , high levels of O60315 protein were positively correlated with pathology grade classification ( P = 0.024 ) of glioma patients . Knockdown of O60315 by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation , migration and invasion , as well as induced cell apoptosis in glioma cells . Furthermore , O60315 downregulation was accompanied by decreased expression of P11802 /6 , P12004 D1 , P12004 E , Q01094 , and c-myc , while p15 and P38936 were upregulated . Lowered expression of O60315 enhanced P12830 levels but also inhibited Î²-Catenin , P08670 , P19022 , and Snail expression . Several apoptosis-related regulators such as P42574 , P55212 , P55211 , and Cleaved-PARP were activated while PARP was inhibited after O60315 siRNA treatment . CONCLUSION : Overexpression of O60315 is an unfavorable factor that may facilitate glioma progression . Knockdown O60315 expression by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation , migration , invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in glioma cells .
