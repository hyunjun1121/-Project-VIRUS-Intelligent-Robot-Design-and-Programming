Role of P34969 receptors in the inhibition of the vasodepressor sensory CGRPergic outflow in pithed rats . The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) in the modulation of vascular tone has been widely documented . Indeed , electrical stimulation of the perivascular sensory outflow in pithed rats induces vasodepressor responses by activation of P80511 receptors . This study investigated the role of P34969 receptors in the inhibition of the rat vasodepressor sensory outflow . Male Wistar pithed rats were pretreated with i.v. continuous infusions of hexamethonium and methoxamine , followed by physiological saline or AS-19 ( a P34969 receptor agonist ) . Then , electrical stimulation of the spinal cord resulted in frequency-dependent decreases in DBP . The infusions of AS-19 , as compared to those of saline , inhibited the vasodepressor responses induced by electrical stimulation without affecting those to i.v. bolus injections of exogenous Î±- P80511 . This inhibition by AS-19 was abolished by the antagonists pimozide ( P34969 ) or sulfisoxazole ( P25101 ) , but not by indomethacin ( P23219 /2 ) or losartan ( AT1 ) , at doses that did not affect per se the electrically-induced vasodepressor responses . Interestingly , glibenclamide ( an DB00171 -dependent K(+) channel blocker ) attenuated these vasodepressor responses . The present results suggest that AS-19-induced inhibition of the rat vasodepressor sensory CGRPergic outflow is mainly mediated by P34969 receptors via endothelin release , with the possible involvement of DB00171 -dependent K(+) channels .
