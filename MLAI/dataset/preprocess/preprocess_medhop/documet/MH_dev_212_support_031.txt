Cholecystokinin-related peptides , after systemic or central administration , prevent carbon monoxide-induced amnesia in mice . The neuroprotective actions of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) peptides were investigated in a mouse hypoxia model , in which the animals were successively exposed to CO gas . Working memory impairment 5 days after CO exposure was examined by using a Y-maze test ; delayed amnesia was examined 7 days after CO exposure , by using a step-down type passive avoidance test . DB00403 ( 1-100 micrograms/kg , given s.c. 30 min before CO exposure ) significantly prevented the CO-induced impairment of performance in both tests , the improvement being correlated with the severity of hypoxia . This severity was increased by maintaining the body temperature at 38 degrees C . DB00403 was less effective when injected immediately after a single CO exposure . The order of potency of the CCK-peptides administered systemically was : ceruletide > CCK-8S > CCK-8NS >> Q13308 . DB00403 ( 0.03-0.3 micrograms/mouse ) and CCK-8S ( 0.03-1 microgram/mouse ) prevented CO-induced amnesia after i.c.v. administration . Under all experimental conditions , dizocilpine [ MK-801 , (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate , 500 micrograms/kg s.c. or 10 micrograms/mouse i.c.v. ] prevented completely the CO-induced amnesia . The protective effects of systemic ceruletide were blocked , partially but significantly , by the preadministration of L-364,718 ( 3S-(-)-N- [ 2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-S-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl ] -1H-indole-2-carboxamide , 1-10 mg/kg i.p. ) , a selective P32238 antagonist . L-365,260 ( [ 3R-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl ] -N ' - [3-methyl-phenyl]urea ) , a CCK-B antagonist , also decreased ceruletide-induced protection.
