Lymphagenesis correlates with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C in colorectal cancer . Lymphagenesis in gastrointestinal tumors is not well described . To clarify its presence and regulation , we assessed the microlymphatic count ( MLC ) in colorectal cancer patients . Lymphatic vessels were evaluated by enzyme-histochemistry for 5'-nucleotidase ( 5'-NA ) . Since vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -C is reportedly associated with lymphagenesis , the expression of P49767 protein was immunohistochemically assessed by the catalyzed signal amplification ( Q13216 ) method . MLC of peritumoral lesions was significantly higher than that of non-cancer and intratumoral lesions ( p < 0.01 ) ; it increased where P49767 was highly expressed ( p < 0.01 ) and increased with the depth of invasion in peritumoral lesions . These results indicate significant findings at peritumoral lesion : that lymphagenesis may be elicited by tumor spread ; that P49767 expression is associated with lymphagenesis and is a potent factor stimulating lymphagenesis .
