Gefitinib ( ' DB00317 ' , ZD1839 ) and new epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a promising target for cancer therapy and a number of P00533 -targeted agents have been developed . Those most advanced in development are the P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib ( ' DB00317 ' , ZD1839 ) and erlotinib ( ' Tarceva ' , DB00530 ) , and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab ( ' Erbitux ' , IMC-C225 ) . This review provides a clinical overview of these agents , highlighting their antitumour activities in different tumour types . P00533 -targeted agents are generally well tolerated and are not typically associated with the severe adverse events often seen with cytotoxic chemotherapy . Gefitinib is the agent with the most extensive clinical experience , particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Recently , gefitinib became the first-approved P00533 -targeted agent , for use in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC in Japan , the USA and other countries . Further studies are required to explore the full potential of these novel agents either as monotherapy or combination therapy .
