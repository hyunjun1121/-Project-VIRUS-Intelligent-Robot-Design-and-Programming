Gene expression in sexually dimorphic muscles in sheep . DB00624 is known to act differentially on skeletal muscle from different regions of the body . Two genes likely to mediate the testosterone effect are insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) , an important growth regulator acting in an autocrine and paracrine way , and androgen receptor ( AR ) , because receptor density could account for differential muscle growth . Another muscle-specific gene that may play a role in differential muscle growth is myostatin , a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily , shown to be a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass . The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the steady state expression of these three genes in two different skeletal muscles in sheep . Eleven Dorset rams were slaughtered after reaching puberty and total RNA was extracted from samples of semitendinosus and splenius muscles . P05019 mRNA was measured using a competitive reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction . P10275 and myostatin mRNA were measured by a ribonuclease protection assay ( RPA ) with standard curves . The means ( attomoles/microg RNA ) for splenius and semitendinosus muscles were 1.39 and 1.02 ( SE = 0.14 ) , 4.05 and 2.96 ( SE = 0.24 ) , and 4.30 and 3.85 ( SE = 0.37 ) for P05019 , AR , and myostatin , respectively . The difference between the two muscles was significant for P05019 and AR mRNA levels with higher levels in the splenius but not significant for myostatin . Our results show that locally produced P05019 and the regulation of AR expression may be important for sexually dimorphic muscle growth patterns .
