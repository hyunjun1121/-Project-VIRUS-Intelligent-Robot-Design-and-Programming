DB01599 inhibits O95477 -mediated cellular lipid efflux . OBJECTIVE : DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) mediates the efflux of lipids from cells to lipid-poor apolipoproteins . In this article , we characterize the effect of probucol on cellular O95477 -mediated lipid efflux . METHODS AND RESULTS : DB01599 inhibited cholesterol efflux up to 80 % in J774 macrophages expressing O95477 . In Fu5AH hepatoma cells that contain scavenger receptor class B , type I , but not functional O95477 , we observed no effect of probucol on cholesterol efflux . DB01599 inhibited cholesterol efflux from normal human skin fibroblasts but not from fibroblasts from a Tangier patient . Fluorescent confocal microscopy and biotinylation assay demonstrated that in J774 cells probucol impaired the translocation of O95477 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane . DB01599 also inhibited the formation of an O95477 -linked cholesterol oxidase sensitive plasma membrane domain . Consistent with the inhibitory effect on O95477 translocation to the plasma membrane , probucol reduced cell surface-specific [ 125I ] -labeled apolipoprotein-AI binding . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that probucol is an effective inhibitor of O95477 -mediated cholesterol efflux without influencing scavenger receptor class B type I-mediated efflux . The inhibition of O95477 translocation to the plasma membrane may in part explain the reported in vivo high-density lipoprotein-lowering action of probucol .
