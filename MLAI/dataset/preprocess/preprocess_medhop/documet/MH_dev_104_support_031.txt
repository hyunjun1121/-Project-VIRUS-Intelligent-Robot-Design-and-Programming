Chromosomal localization of the human prostanoid receptor gene family . Prostaglandins ( PGD2 , DB00917 , PGF2 alpha , and DB01240 ) and thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) are biologically active molecules derived from the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases . They produce a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological effects mediated through specific G protein-coupled cell surface receptors . In this study , we have mapped the chromosomal positions of the human genes that encode the DB00917 receptor subtypes ( P34995 , PTGER2 , and P43115 ) , the PGF2 alpha receptor ( P43088 ) , the P43119 ( P43119 ) , and the TXA2 receptor ( P21731 ) using in situ hybridization . The P34995 , P21731 , and P43119 genes mapped to chromosome 19 at positions 19p13.1 , 19p13.3 , and 19q13.3 , respectively . The P43088 and P43115 genes mapped to chromosome 1 at positions 1p31.1 and 1p31.2 , respectively , and PTGER2 gene mapped to chromosome band 5p13.1 .
