Induction of differentiation and apoptosis in leukaemic cell lines by the novel benzamide family histone deacetylase 2 and 3 inhibitor MI-192 . Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACIs ) are in advanced clinical development as cancer therapeutic agents . However , first generation HDACIs such as butyrate and valproate are simple short chain aliphatic compounds with moieties resembling acetyl groups , and have a broad spectrum of activity against HDACs . More complex second generation HDACIs undergoing clinical trials , such as the benzamide group compounds MS-275 and DB05651 , are specific primarily for Q13547 and Q92769 . To expand the repertoire of available HDACIs and HDAC specificities we created a novel benzamide-based compound named MI-192 . When tested against purified recombinant HDACs , MI-192 had marked selectivity for the class I enzymes , Q92769 and O15379 . Screening in the NCI60 screen demonstrated that MI-192 had greatly enhanced efficacy against cells of leukaemic origin . When tested in culture against the acute myeloid leukaemic cell lines U937 , HL60 and Kasumi-1 , MI-192 induced differentiation and was cytotoxic through promotion of apoptosis . MI-192 therefore justifies further investigation and development as a potential therapeutic agent for use in leukaemia .
