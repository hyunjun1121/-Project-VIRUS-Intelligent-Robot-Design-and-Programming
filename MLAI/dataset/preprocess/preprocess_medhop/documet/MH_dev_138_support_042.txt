DB08860 prevents DB01221 -induced retinal ganglion cell death by suppressing leukocyte recruitment . Excitotoxicity is a major cause of retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) death during ischemic diseases such as vessel occlusion and diabetic retinopathy . However , the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . Statins , inhibitors of the P04035 , have neuroprotective effects in addition to their original role in lowering cholesterol . We hypothesize that pitavastatin , a recently introduced potent statin , is protective against N-methyl-d-aspartic acid ( DB01221 ) -induced RGC death . DB08860 , administered by gavage , abolished DB01221 -induced loss of RGCs . To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of pitavastatin , we investigated its impact on inflammation . DB01221 increased the expression of interleukin-1beta and P01375 , and endothelial adhesion molecules , including P05362 , and induced leukocyte accumulation in the retinal vessels . DB08860 significantly reduced DB01221 -induced leukocyte accumulation and up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules , whereas cytokine expression was unaffected . Systemic blockade of P05362 in wild-type mice or absence of P05107 in gene-deficient ( P05107 (-/-) ) mice significantly suppressed DB01221 -induced leukocyte accumulation and RGC death . These findings suggest a novel and causative role for inflammatory leukocyte recruitment in DB01221 -induced excitotoxicity . Furthermore , we show the novel neuroprotective effect of statins against excitotoxicity-induced RGC death . Statins or other anti-inflammatory agents may thus have therapeutic benefits in excitotoxicity-associated neuronal diseases through blockade of leukocyte recruitment .
