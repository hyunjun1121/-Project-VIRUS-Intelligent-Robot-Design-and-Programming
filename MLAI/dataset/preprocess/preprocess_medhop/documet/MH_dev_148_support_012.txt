P35372 expression is increased in inflammatory bowel diseases : implications for homeostatic intestinal inflammation . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Recent studies with mu opioid receptor ( MOR ) deficient mice support a physiological anti-inflammatory effect of MOR at the colon interface . To better understand the potential pharmacological effect of certain opiates in inflammatory bowel diseases ( Q9UKU7 ) , we ( 1 ) evaluated the regulation in vivo and in vitro of human MOR expression by inflammation ; and ( 2 ) tested the potential anti-inflammatory function of a specific opiate ( DALDA ) in inflamed and resting human mucosa . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Expression of MOR mRNA and protein was evaluated in healthy and inflamed small bowel and colonic tissues , isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes , and P01730 + and CD8+ T cells from healthy donors and Q9UKU7 patients . The effect of cytokines and nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) activation on MOR expression in lymphocyte T and monocytic human cell lines was assessed . Finally , DALDA induced anti-inflammatory effect was investigated in mucosal explants from controls and Q9UKU7 patients . RESULTS : MOR was expressed in ileal and colonic enteric neurones as well as in immunocytes such as myeloid cells and P01730 + and CD8+ T cells . Overexpressed in active Q9UKU7 mucosa , MOR was significantly enhanced by cytokines and repressed by NFkappaB inhibitor in myeloid and lymphocytic cell lines . Furthermore , ex vivo DALDA treatment dampened tumour necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression in the colon of active Q9UKU7 patients . CONCLUSIONS : Given the increased expression of MOR and the ex vivo beneficial effect of DALDA in active Q9UKU7 , natural and/or synthetic opioid agonists could help to prevent overt pathological intestinal inflammation .
