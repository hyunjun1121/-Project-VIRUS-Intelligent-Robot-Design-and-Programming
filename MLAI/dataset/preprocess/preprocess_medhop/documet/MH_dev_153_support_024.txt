Novel P0C6A0 mimetics developed to treat type 2 diabetes promote progenitor cell proliferation in the brain . One of the symptoms of diabetes is the progressive development of neuropathies . One mechanism to replace neurons in the CNS is through the activation of stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells . We have tested the effects of the novel P0C6A0 mimetics exenatide ( exendin-4 ; DB01276 ) and liraglutide ( DB06655 ; DB06655 ) , which are already on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes , on the proliferation rate of progenitor cells and differentiation into neurons in the dentate gyrus of brains of mouse models of diabetes . P0C6A0 analogues were injected subcutaneously for 4 , 6 , or 10 weeks once daily in three mouse models of diabetes : ob/ob mice , db/db mice , or high-fat-diet-fed mice . Twenty-four hours before perfusion , animals were injected with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) to mark dividing progenitor cells . By using immunohistochemistry and stereological methods , the number of progenitor cells or doublecortin-positive young neurons in the dentate gyrus was estimated . We found that , in all three mouse models , progenitor cell division was enhanced compared with nondiabetic controls after chronic i.p. injection of either liraglutide or exendin-4 by 100-150 % ( P < 0.001 ) . We also found an increase in young neurons in the DG of high-fat-diet-fed mice after drug treatment ( P < 0.001 ) . The P43220 antagonist exendin(9-36) reduced progenitor cell proliferation in these mice . The results demonstrate that P0C6A0 mimetics show promise as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease , because these novel drugs cross the blood-brain barrier and increase neuroneogenesis .
