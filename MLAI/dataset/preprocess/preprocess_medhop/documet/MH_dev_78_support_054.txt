In vivo effects of meloxicam and aspirin on blood , gastric mucosal , and synovial fluid prostanoid synthesis in dogs . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate in vivo activity in dogs of meloxicam or aspirin , previously shown in vitro to be a selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor ( P23219 sparing drug ) , or a nonselective P36551 inhibitor , respectively . ANIMALS : 12 male dogs with unilateral osteoarthritis of the stifle joint . PROCEDURE : Each dog was treated in a crossover design with aspirin or meloxicam for 21 days . DB00917 ( DB00917 ) concentrations were measured at days 0 ( baseline ) , 7 , and 21 of each treatment period in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated blood , synovial fluid collected by arthrocentesis , and endoscopic gastric mucosal biopsy specimens . Thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) was evaluated in blood on days 0 , 7 , and 21 of each treatment period . RESULTS : DB00945 administration significantly suppressed DB00917 concentrations in blood , gastric mucosa , synovial fluid , and suppressed TXB2 concentration in blood at days 7 and 21 . Meloxicam administration significantly suppressed DB00917 concentrations in blood and synovial fluid at days 7 and 21 , but had no effect on concentrations of TXB2 in blood or DB00917 in gastric mucosa . Suppression of LPS-stimulated DB00917 concentrations in blood and synovial fluid by aspirin and meloxicam administration is consistent with activity against the P35354 isoenzyme . Suppression of concentrations of DB00917 in the gastric mucosa and TXB2 in blood by aspirin administration is consistent with activity against P23219 . Meloxicam , in contrast , had a minimal effect on functions mediated by P23219 . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Meloxicam acts in vivo in dogs as a P23219 sparing drug on target tissues by sparing gastric DB00917 synthesis while retaining antiprostaglandin effects within inflamed joints .
