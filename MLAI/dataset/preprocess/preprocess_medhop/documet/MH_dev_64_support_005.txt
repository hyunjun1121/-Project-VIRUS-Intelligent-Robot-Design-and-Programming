[ A new perspective in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Role of afatinib : An oral and irreversible ErbB family blocker ] . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) that block epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) pathway have demonstrated a clinical benefit for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring P00533 mutations . The currently available TKI ( gefitinib and erlotinib ) are P00533 reversible inhibitors . DB08916 is an oral , irreversible ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and blocks signaling from P00533 ( ErbB1 ) , P04626 ( ErbB2 ) and ErbB4 . The compound inhibits also the transphosphorylation of ErbB3 . With this mode of action , afatinib is thought to have a mechanistic advantage over P00533 blockade alone , in that it provides a sustained , covalent inhibition of ErbB homo- and hetero-dimers . In the pivotal LUX-Lung 3 study , afatinib demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival over standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy ( 11.1 versus 6.9 months ; HR = 0.58 , 95 % CI : 0.43-0.78 ; P = 0.001 ) in P00533 mutation positive NSCLC patients . The compound has recently been granted a marketing authorization ( MA ) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating P00533 mutation(s) and P00533 TKI-naive . In this paper are summarized the efficacy and safety data in this indication .
