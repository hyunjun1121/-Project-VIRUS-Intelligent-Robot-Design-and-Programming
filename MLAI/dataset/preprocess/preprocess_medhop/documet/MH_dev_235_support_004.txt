DB01169 inhibits osteosarcoma cell invasiveness via MAPK signaling pathway . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) is an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine . Recent studies showed that it causes apoptosis in several cancer cells . However , research of As(2)O(3) in osteosarcoma is sparse . In our present study , an inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) on osteosarcoma cell adhesion and metastasis was observed with a cell adhesion , migration and invasion test . The impact of As(2)O(3) on the activities of P14780 and MAPK pathway-related downstream factors was analyzed by western blotting . Our results showed that As(2)O(3) significantly inhibited motility , migration and invasion in Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.5-2 Î¼M , and led to cytoskeletal rearrangements . As(2)O(3) exerted an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and MEK , which are the members of the MAPK family . Additionally , treatment with As(2)O(3) in combination with inhibitors specific for MEK ( U0126 ) in Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells resulted in a marked inhibition of cell invasion and As(2)O(3) could significantly reduce PMA-induced invasion . In conclusion , we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of As(2)O(3) on the invasiveness of Q9UKB1 and MNNG cells , which may be due at least partly to inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway .
