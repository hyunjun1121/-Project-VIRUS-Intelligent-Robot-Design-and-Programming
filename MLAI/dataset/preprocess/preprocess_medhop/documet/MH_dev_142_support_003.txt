S-nitrosoglutathione modulates P61073 and Q9Y6W8 expression . The expression of P61073 , a membrane protein which is involved in the entry of HIV-1 , is down-modulated from the cell surface by Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and the Ca+ ionophore , Ionomycin . Inducible co-stimulator ( Q9Y6W8 ) , which contributes to lymphocyte proliferation , is up-regulated by PMA/Ionomycin . We examined the influence of S-nitrosoglutathione ( SNG ) , an inhibitor of Vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) , on the expression of P61073 and Q9Y6W8 in PMA/Ionomycin-treated peripheral mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , and of P61073 alone in lymphoid cell lines . In this report , we show that SNG interferes with both effects of PMA/Ionomycin , namely P61073 down-regulation and Q9Y6W8 up-regulation . These studies imply opposing roles of V-ATPase in the regulation of P61073 and Q9Y6W8 . The influence of SNG in modulating the susceptibility of T cells to HIV-1 and on their immune responses needs further investigation .
