Functional polymorphisms of folate-metabolizing enzymes in relation to homocysteine concentrations in systemic lupus erythematosus . OBJECTIVE : To determine if functional polymorphisms of folate/homocysteine pathway enzymes are associated with homocysteine concentrations and/or coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) scores in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and controls . METHODS : We investigated 163 SLE patients and 160 controls . Functional polymorphisms in 6 genes in the folate/homocysteine pathway were genotyped : 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( P42898 ) 677C > T , P42898 1298A > C , cystathionine ss-synthase ( P35520 ) 844ins68 , methionine synthase ( Q99707 ) 2756A > G , methionine synthase reductase ( Q9UBK8 ) 66A > G , thymidylate synthase ( P04818 ) 1494del6 , and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) c.86+60_78 . RESULTS : Homocysteine levels were higher in African American SLE patients than Caucasian patients and African American controls . Genotype distributions were significantly different in African American and Caucasian controls for 6 of the 7 polymorphisms . Genotype distributions for each polymorphism did not differ significantly between SLE patients and controls even after stratification by race . Glomerular filtration rate was strongly negatively correlated to homocysteine levels , and was therefore adjusted for as a covariate in the models of the effects of the polymorphisms on homocysteine levels . In SLE patients none of the 7 polymorphisms was associated with homocysteine concentrations . In Caucasian controls only P42898 677C > T and 1298A > C showed effects on homocysteine similar to what would be expected from the literature . There were no genotypic associations with median CAC scores in SLE patients or controls with and without stratification by race . CONCLUSION : Polymorphisms in folate/homocysteine metabolizing enzymes do not predict higher homocysteine levels or CAC scores in patients with SLE .
