DB00134 recycling pathways and antimalarial drug design . 5'-Deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine ( MTA ) is an S-adenosylmethionine metabolite that is generated as a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis . In mammalian cells , MTA undergoes a phosphorolytic cleavage catalyzed by Q13126 to produce adenine and 5-deoxy-5-(methylthio)ribose-1-phosphate ( Q15012 ) . DB00173 is utilized in purine salvage pathways , and Q15012 is subsequently recycled to methionine . Whereas some microorganisms metabolize MTA to Q15012 via Q13126 , others metabolize MTA to Q15012 in two steps via initial cleavage by MTA nucleosidase to adenine and 5-deoxy-5-(methylthio)ribose ( Q99707 ) followed by conversion of Q99707 to Q15012 by Q99707 kinase . In order to assess the extent to which these pathways may be operative in Plasmodium falciparum , we have examined a series of 5'-alkyl-substituted analogs of MTA and the related Q99707 analogs and compared their abilities to inhibit in vitro growth of this malarial parasite . The Q99707 analogs 5-deoxy-5-(ethylthio)ribose and 5-deoxy-5-(hydroxyethylthio)ribose were inactive at concentrations up to 1 mM , and 5-deoxy-5-(monofluoroethylthio)ribose was weakly active ( 50 % inhibitory concentration = 700 microM ) . In comparison , the MTA analogs , 5'-deoxy-5'-(ethylthio)adenosine,5'-deoxy-5'-(hydroxyethylthio)ade nosine ( HETA ) , and 5'-deoxy-5'-(monofluoroethylthio)adenosine , had 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 80 , 46 , and 61 microM , respectively . Extracts of P. falciparum were found to have substantial Q13126 activity . Coadministration of MTA with HETA partially protected the parasites against the growth-inhibitory effects of HETA . Results of this study indicate that P. falciparum has an active Q13126 that can be targeted by analogs of MTA .
