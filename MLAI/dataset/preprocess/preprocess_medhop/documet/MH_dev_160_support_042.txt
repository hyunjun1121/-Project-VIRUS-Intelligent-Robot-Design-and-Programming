DB00065 reduces the cytokine-mediated inflammation but does not suppress cellular infiltration of the vessel wall in refractory Kawasaki disease . The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab for the treatment of patients with refractory Kawasaki disease ( KD ) and investigate the dynamic changes of cytokines during infliximab treatment . We have performed a study of cytokine and proinflammatory molecule levels in 43 KD patients including 18 responders to IVIG , 14 nonresponders , and 11 patients treated with infliximab . We determined serum levels of soluble P01375 receptor I ( sTNFR I ) and P05231 , as well as P15692 , damage associated molecular pattern ( DAMP ) molecules ; myeloid-related protein (MRP)8/ P06702 and P80511 sequentially . In eight patients , fever subsided immediately upon infliximab treatment . Four patients , who started infliximab after 12 d of illness , developed coronary artery lesions . Each of the cytokines was elevated before infliximab treatment in all patients . Although serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines decreased dramatically after infliximab treatment , DAMP molecules and P15692 and markers of local tissue damage were not suppressed . In contrast , in IVIG responders all cytokines decreased markedly after IVIG treatment . We show that infliximab is one of the adoptive therapies in refractory KD patients . Different behaviors of proinflammatory cytokines and DAMP molecules and P15692 after infliximab treatment suggest that infliximab is effective for suppression of cytokine-mediated inflammation , but could not completely block local vasculitis .
