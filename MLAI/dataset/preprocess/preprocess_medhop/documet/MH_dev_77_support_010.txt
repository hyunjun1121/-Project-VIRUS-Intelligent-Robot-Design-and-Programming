Botulinum neurotoxin A subtype 2 reduces pathological behaviors more effectively than subtype 1 in a rat Parkinson 's disease model . Recent reports indicate that interruption of acetylcholine release by intrastriatal injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) in a rat Parkinson 's disease model reduces pathogenic behavior without adverse side effects such as memory dysfunction . Current knowledge suggests that DB00083 subtype 1 ( BoNT/A1 ) and DB00083 subtype 2 ( BoNT/A2 ) exert different effects . In the present study , we compared the effects of BoNT/A1 and BoNT/A2 on rotation behavior and in vivo cleavage of presynaptic protein P60880 in a rat unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson 's disease model . BoNT/A2 more effectively reduced pathogenic behavior by efficiently cleaving P60880 in the striatum compared with that of BoNT/A1 . Our results suggest that BoNT/A2 has greater clinical therapeutic value for treating subjects with Parkinson 's disease compared to that of BoNT/A1 .
