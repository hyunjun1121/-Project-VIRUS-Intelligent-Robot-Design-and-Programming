DB00435 production stimulated by the basic fibroblast growth factor requires the synthesis of ceramide . DB00435 ( NO ) is an intracellular and intercellular mediator involved in the modulation of many physiologic and pathologic processes including the regulation of neoangiogenesis . We analyzed the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) on NO production in CHO- P04264 cells and the intracellular mechanisms involved . P09038 induces NO production through activation of the endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) , causing a subsequent increase in cGMP levels . In most systems , P29474 activation is a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent process . In CHO- P04264 cells , NO production by P09038 is Ca(2+) and Q96HU1 kinase independent , because it was not reverted by pretreatment with intracellular Ca(2+) chelators or MEK inhibitors . Translocation of the P29474 from the plasma membrane , where it is bound to caveolin 1 , to the cytosol is the crucial step in the synthesis of NO . We demonstrate that the cytosolic translocation of P29474 is caused by increased synthesis of ceramide dependent by the P09038 activation of sphingomyelinase . Indeed , in the presence of the sphingomyelinase inhibitors D609 or desipramine , P09038 -dependent NO production is abrogated . To support this evidence we evaluated ceramide concentration using HPLC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry in controls and in P09038 -treated cells : after P09038 stimulation , a substantial increase in ceramide levels was observed . These data were further confirmed by the lack of NO production in response to fibroblast growth factor in fibroblasts derived from Niemann Pick patients who genetically lack the enzyme sphingomyelinase . In conclusion , ceramide in CHO- P04264 cells is responsible for a novel Ca(2+)/calmodulin-independent mechanism for P29474 activation after fibroblast growth factor stimulation .
