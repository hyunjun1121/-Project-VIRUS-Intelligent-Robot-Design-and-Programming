DB01590 tablets for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma . INTRODUCTION : Better understanding of aberrantly active molecular pathways in tumors offers potential to develop more specific and less toxic therapies . Abnormal mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) complex signaling and defects in Q92574 and P49815 have been associated with the development of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs ) in tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) patients . Recently , P42345 inhibitors such as everolimus have shown encouraging benefit for patients with SEGAs . AREAS COVERED : The authors discuss a molecular genetic pathway linked with TSC , specifically the role of two proteins whose functional absence is responsible for most SEGA tumors that arise in TSC patients . The authors also examine the rationale for targeted agents against this pathway therapeutically and describe the clinical evidence underlying the FDA approval of everolimus for patients with inoperable SEGAs . EXPERT OPINION : DB01590 ( Afinitor ) selectively targets a molecular defect of SEGAs in TSC patients . Although surgery is effective , most SEGAs recur . An agent that inhibits an underlying molecular abnormality represents a particularly attractive therapeutic option for patients with inoperable or recurrent tumors . Studies are also underway to assess everolimus in treating other sequelae of TSC , and other gliomas . Finally , additional research aimed at better understanding aberrant cell signaling pathways may lead to the development of more effective therapeutics .
