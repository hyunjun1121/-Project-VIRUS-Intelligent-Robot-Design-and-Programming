Serotonin provides an accessory signal to enhance T-cell activation by signaling through the P34969 receptor . Although typically considered a neurotransmitter , there is substantial evidence that serotonin ( 5-HT ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders . Despite these findings , the precise role of 5-HT in modulating immune function , particularly T-cell function , remains elusive . We report that naive T cells predominantly express the type 7 5-HT receptor ( 5-HTR ) , and expression of this protein is substantially enhanced on T-cell activation . In addition , T-cell activation leads to expression of the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(2A) receptors . Significantly , exogenous 5-HT induces rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 ( P27361 /2 ) and P25963 in naive T cells . 5-HT-induced activation of P27361 /2 and NFkappaB is inhibited by preincubation with a specific 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist . Thus , 5-HT signaling via the 5-HT(7) receptor may contribute to early T-cell activation . In turn , 5-HT synthesized by T cells may act as an autocrine factor . Consistent with this hypothesis , we found that inhibition of 5-HT synthesis with parachlorophenylalanine ( PCPA ) impairs T-cell activation and proliferation . Combined , these data demonstrate a fundamental role for 5-HT as an intrinsic cofactor in T-cell activation and function and suggest an alternative mechanism through which immune function may be regulated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-mediated catabolism of tryptophan .
