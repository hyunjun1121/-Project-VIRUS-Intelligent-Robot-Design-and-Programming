Effects of epidermal growth factor on MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells : alterations in polyamine biosynthesis and the expression of P38936 /CIP1/ P38936 . We examined the effects of epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) on MDA-MB-468 cells to understand its mechanism of action in an P01133 receptor-rich breast cancer cell line . P01133 inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-468 cells with an IC50 of 1.5 +/- 0.5 nM , as determined by measurements of DNA content of cells in culture over a period of 4 to 6 days . This growth inhibition included apoptosis 24 h after P01133 addition , as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and Hoechst 33342 staining . In P01133 -treated cells , peak activities of two key enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis , ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( P17707 ) , were reduced by 57 % and 83 % , respectively . P01133 treatment also caused a 30 to 50 % decrease in cellular putrescine at all time points tested ( 12 to 48 h ) . P01133 -induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was also partially reversed by the addition of putrescine or spermidine , but not by spermine . Western blot analysis of cell cycle regulatory proteins showed that P01133 -mediated growth inhibition was associated with the induction of P38936 , an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases . However , P01133 had no significant effect on the expression of cyclin D1 or cyclin E . Furthermore , putrescine reversal of P01133 effects was associated with the down-regulation of P01133 -induced P38936 . These results suggest that the mechanism of growth inhibition by P01133 in MDA-MB-468 cells include a down-regulation of polyamine biosynthesis and the induction of P38936 . Identification of growth regulatory pathways in breast cancer cells might be useful in the development of novel targets for therapeutic intervention .
