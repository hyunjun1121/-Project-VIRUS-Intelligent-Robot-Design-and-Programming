P22303 antagonist potentiated insulin action in fed but not fasted state . The glucose disposal effect of insulin is doubled in response to a meal . This meal-induced insulin sensitization results from insulin acting on the liver , in the presence of a permissive hepatic parasympathetic feeding signal and elevated hepatic glutathione ( DB00143 ) , to release hepatic insulin-sensitizing substance ( HISS ) , a hormone that acts selectively on skeletal muscle to stimulate insulin-mediated glucose uptake . Blockade of the parasympathetic feeding signal to the liver , either through surgical denervation or atropine-mediated antagonism of hepatic muscarinic receptors , eliminates the HISS response , resulting in HISS-dependent insulin resistance ( HDIR ) and decreasing the response to insulin by approximately 55 % in the fed state . P01308 action in Sprague-Dawley rats , as determined with a rapidly sampled , transient euglycemic clamp in response to insulin ( 50 mU/kg ) , is decreased in a dose-dependent manner by atropine . In this study , we have used the ED75 atropine-induced model of HDIR . After a submaximal dose of atropine , potentiation of the remaining parasympathetic effect with the acetylcholinesterase antagonist neostigmine significantly restored postprandial insulin sensitization in a dose-dependent manner with peak effect at 0.1 microg/kg/min . DB01400 reversed the insulin resistance induced by partial fasting and partial muscarinic inhibition ( hepatic DB00143 levels are at fed levels ) , but not that induced by surgical hepatic denervation ( DB00143 normal , no nerve signal ) or 24-h fasting ( low DB00143 ) . No potentiation of the response to insulin by neostigmine occurred in normal , fed rats . The data suggest the use of either direct or indirectly acting cholinergic agonists for the treatment of impaired postprandial insulin sensitization .
