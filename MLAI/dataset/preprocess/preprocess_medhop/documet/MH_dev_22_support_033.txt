A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model elucidating the disposition of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) for treatment of metastatic breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) therapeutic for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive cancers . The DB05773 dose product contains a mixture of drug-to-antibody ratio ( DAR ) moieties whereby the small molecule DM1 is chemically conjugated to trastuzumab antibody . The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) underlying this system and other ADCs are complex and have not been elucidated . Accordingly , we have developed two PK modeling approaches from preclinical data to conceptualize and understand DB05773 PK , to quantify rates of DM1 deconjugation , and to elucidate the link between trastuzumab , DB05773 , and DAR measurements . Preclinical data included PK studies in rats ( n = 34 ) and cynomolgus monkeys ( n = 18 ) at doses ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg and in vitro plasma stability . DB05773 and total trastuzumab ( TT ) plasma concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Individual DAR moieties were measured by affinity capture liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry . Two PK modeling approaches were developed for DB05773 using NONMEM 7.2 software : a mechanistic model fit simultaneously to TT and DAR concentrations and a reduced model fit simultaneously to TT and DB05773 concentrations . DAR moieties were well described with a three-compartmental model and DM1 deconjugation in the central compartment . DM1 deconjugated fastest from the more highly loaded trastuzumab molecules ( i.e. , DAR moieties that are â‰¥3 DM1 per trastuzumab ) . DB05773 clearance ( CL ) was 2-fold faster than TT CL due to deconjugation . The two modeling approaches provide flexibility based on available analytical measurements for DB05773 and a framework for designing ADC studies and PK-pharmacodynamic modeling of ADC efficacy- and toxicity-related endpoints .
