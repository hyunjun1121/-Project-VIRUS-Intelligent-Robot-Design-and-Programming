Effect of thymoglobulin induction on HIV-infected renal transplant recipients : differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients . The best immunosuppressive regimen in HIV-infected renal transplant recipients has not been established . DB00098 has been associated with an increased risk of serious bacterial infections in HIV-negative patients and , for this reason , there is some concern over its use in the HIV-infected population . We describe three consecutive HIV-infected renal transplant recipients who received thymoglobulin as induction therapy , and we compared their progress with a cohort of 23 HIV-negative recipients . Median follow-up was 24 and 11 months , respectively . Nadir lymphocytopenia was observed at 1 week in both groups , and their absolute lymphocyte count recovery was similar . An early and deep ( < 30 cells/mm(3) ) P01730 (+) T cell lymphocytopenia was seen in two of the three HIV-infected patients . No opportunistic infections were diagnosed in HIV-positive patients . One HIV-positive patient had a bacterial infection and five HIV-negative patients had one or more bacterial infections . DB00098 was safe in our three HIV-infected renal transplant recipients . Until those data are confirmed in larger studies , close monitoring is recommended during the thymoglobulin-induced P01730 (+) T cell lymphocytopenia period .
