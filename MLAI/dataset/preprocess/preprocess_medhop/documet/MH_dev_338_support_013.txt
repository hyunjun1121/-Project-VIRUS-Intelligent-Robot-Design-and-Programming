First intracellular loop of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor is essential for cyclic AMP signaling in transfected P29320 -293 cells . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) -A and CCK-B receptors are highly homologous members of the seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily . Genes of both receptors contain five exons and share a similar exon-intron organization . To determine the structural basis of P32238 ( P32238 ) functionally coupled to Gs , a series of chimeric mutants were constructed by replacing exons of human P32239 ( P32239 ) , from the second to the fifth ( last ) exon , with human P32238 counterparts . Binding and signal transduction properties of wild-type and chimeric receptors were examined in stably transfected P29320 -293 cells . Chimeric receptors that maintained high affinity binding to CCK exhibited dose-dependent increases in intracellular calcium mobilization similar to both wild-type receptors . However , only the wild-type P32238 and chimeric mutants containing the second exon of P32238 were able to mediate significantly greater increases in intracellular DB02527 content and adenylyl cyclase activity compared with wild-type P32239 . A P32239 mutant was further constructed by replacing five amino acids , DB00145 - DB00149 - DB00133 - DB00125 -( DB00125 )- DB00149 , in the first intracellular loop with the corresponding five P32238 specific amino acids , DB00167 - DB00125 - DB00174 -Lys-( DB00125 )- DB00134 . The resultant receptor maintained high affinity binding to both CCK and gastrin and dose-dependent calcium responses similar to wild-type P32239 . However , this first intracellular loop mutant also gained positive DB02527 responses to both sulfated CCK-8 and gastrin-17 with EC50 values of 8.5 +/- 1 nM and 23 +/- 7 nM , respectively . These data suggest that the first intracellular loop of P32238 is essential for coupling to Gs and activation of adenylyl cyclase signal transduction cascade .
