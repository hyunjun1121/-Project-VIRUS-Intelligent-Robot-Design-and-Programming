DB00160 aminotransferase homologs catalyze the glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction in peroxisomes of Arabidopsis . Plant peroxisomal glyoxylate aminotransferases play central roles within the photorespiratory pathway . Genes encoding glyoxylate aminotransferases have been isolated from several animals and microbes , but only recently have plant homologs been identified . Three Arabidopsis homologs of alanine (Ala):glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 ( Q9BYV1 ) contain a putative type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal ( PTS1 ) , but the metabolic significance of these Q9BYV1 homologs is unknown . P19440 and P36268 are Ala aminotransferase ( AlaAT ) homologs from Arabidopsis that represent another type of glyoxylate aminotransferase . These proteins are class I aminotransferases , each containing a putative PTS1 . P19440 and P36268 are members of a small family of AlaATs in Arabidopsis . When expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli , P19440 and P36268 displayed biochemical characteristics very similar to one another , and to the Arabidopsis protein purified from leaves . Four aminotransferase activities were specifically associated with P19440 and P36268 , using the substrate pairs glutamate ( DB00142 ):glyoxylate , Ala:glyoxylate , DB00142 :pyruvate , and Ala:2-oxoglutarate . P19440 and P36268 may have partially redundant functions ; transcripts of both genes were detected in many of the same tissues . Although DB00142 :glyoxylate aminotransferase ( P19440 ) activity has been observed in several locations in different plants and algae , including the cytoplasm and mitochondria , our subcellular fractionation data indicate that P19440 activity was exclusively peroxisomal in Arabidopsis . Thus , glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions in plant peroxisomes appear to be catalyzed by at least two distinct types of aminotransferases : an AGT1 homolog with serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase activity ( A.H. Liepman , L.J. Olsen [ 2001 ] Plant J 25 : 487-498 ) , and a pair of closely related , potentially redundant AlaAT homologs with P19440 activity .
