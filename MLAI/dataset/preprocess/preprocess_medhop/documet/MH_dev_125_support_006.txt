Preterm Cervical Ripening in humans . Preterm birth ( PTB ) is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity . Despite the current treatment procedures , the incidence of PTB has not changed in the past thirty years . Incomplete understanding of the biological and patophysiological mechanisms underlying preterm delivery is the major obstacle to prevent PTB . Cervical ripening is necessary for vaginal delivery and understanding of preterm cervical ripening is required for developing new treatment strategies . Several important substances such as P09429 and its receptors , P06850 and its receptors and numerous cytokines are localized in the cervix and undergo distinct changes in labour . Other important -molecules , such as P06850 , P24387 , P34998 , Q13324 , P09429 , O60603 , O00206 , P22301 , IL-12 , are localized in the cervical epithelium , also indicating their role in the process of cervical ripening during labour . Furthermore , P06850 stimulates P10145 secretion from both preterm and term cervical fibroblasts . Recent studies from our group show that major -inflammatory changes occur in the cervix at labour irrespective of gestational age . This indicates that cervical ripening at both term and preterm is an inflammatory process even if no infection is present . However , preterm cervical ripening still entails some differences from term cervical ripening , for example in the down-regulation of mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors ( TLR-2 and TLR-4 ) and IL-12 , higher levels of P22301 in cervical epithelium , and presents different secretion patterns of cervical fibroblasts . Moreover , preterm cervical ripening , like preterm delivery itself , is a multifactorial disorder with pathways which are partly different from those involved in PPROM and infected preterm labour .
