Q01094 -mediated transcriptional inhibition of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene . Gene expression of the plasminogen activation system is cell-cycle dependent . Previously , we showed that ectopic expression of Q01094 repressed the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) promoter in a manner dependent on the presence of DNA-binding and transactivation domains of Q01094 but independent of binding to pocket-binding proteins , suggesting a novel mechanism for E2F-mediated negative gene regulation [ Koziczak , M. , Krek , W. & Nagamine , Y. ( 2000 ) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20 , 2014-2022 ] . However , it remains to be seen whether endogenous E2F can exert a similar effect . We report here that down-regulation of P05121 gene expression correlates with an increase in endogenous E2F activity . When cells were treated with a cdk2/4-specific inhibitor , which maintains E2F in an inactive state , the decline of serum-induced P05121 mRNA levels was suppressed . In mutant U2OS cells expressing a temperature-sensitive retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) , a shift to a permissive temperature induced P05121 mRNA expression . In U2OS cells stably expressing an Q01094 -estrogen receptor chimeric protein that could be activated by tamoxifen , P05121 gene transcription was markedly reduced by tamoxifen even in the presence of cycloheximide . These results all indicate that endogenous E2F can directly repress the P05121 gene . P24855 hypersensitive-site analysis of the P05121 promoter suggested the involvement of conformation changes in chromatin structure of the P05121 promoter . 5' deletion analysis of the P05121 promoter showed that multiple sites were responsible for the E2F negative regulation , some of which were promoter dependent . Interestingly , one of these sites is a p53-binding element .
