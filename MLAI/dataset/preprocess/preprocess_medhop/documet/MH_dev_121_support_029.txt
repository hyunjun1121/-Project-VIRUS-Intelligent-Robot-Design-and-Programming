DB04540 attenuates linoleic acid-induced endothelial cell activation . Vascular endothelial cell activation and dysfunction are critical early events in atherosclerosis . Even though very low or high levels of cholesterol can compromise cellular functions , cholesterol is a critical membrane component and may protect the vascular endothelium from oxidative stress and polyunsaturated fatty acid-mediated inflammatory responses . We have previously shown that the parent omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid can markedly activate vascular endothelial cells . We now propose that membrane cholesterol can modify and inhibit linoleic acid-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction . To test this hypothesis , pulmonary artery endothelial cells were incubated with cholesterol ( 0 to 100 micromol/L ) for 24 hours and then treated with 90 micromol/L of linoleic acid ( 18:2n-6 ) for 6 to 24 hours . In control cells , treatment with linoleic acid reduced intracellular glutathione levels and induced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) leading to the upregulation of interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) . In addition , the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) was altered , with linoleic acid increasing P29474 activity . In contrast , enrichment with cholesterol enhanced glutathione levels and reduced the linoleic acid-induced activation of NF-kappaBand the production of P05231 . Prior exposure to 50 micromol/L cholesterol also prevented the fatty acid-induced increase in P29474 activation . DB04540 loading activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) , a nuclear receptor that can decrease inflammatory responses . Furthermore , the P37231 agonist thiazolidinedione markedly downregulated the NF-kappaB activation mediated by linoleic acid . Our data suggest that signaling pathways linked to endothelial cell activation by prooxidant and proinflammatory insults may be influenced by cellular cholesterol levels .
