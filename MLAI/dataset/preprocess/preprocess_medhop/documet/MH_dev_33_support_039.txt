Scutellarein Reduces Inflammatory Responses by Inhibiting Src Kinase Activity . Flavonoids are plant pigments that have been demonstrated to exert various pharmacological effects including anti-cancer , anti-diabetic , anti-atherosclerotic , anti-bacterial , and anti-inflammatory activities . However , the molecular mechanisms in terms of exact target proteins of flavonoids are not fully elucidated yet . In this study , we aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of scutellarein ( P09683 ) , a flavonoid isolated from Erigeron breviscapus , Clerodendrum phlomidis and Oroxylum indicum Vent that have been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases in China and Brazil . For this purpose , a nitric oxide ( NO ) assay , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , nuclear fractionation , immunoblot analysis , a kinase assay , and an overexpression strategy were employed . Scutellarein significantly inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the mRNA expression levels of inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -activated RAW264.7 cells . In addition , P09683 also dampened nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB-driven expression of a luciferase reporter gene upon transfection of a TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β ( Q8IUC6 ) construct into Human embryonic kidney 293 ( P29320 293 ) cells ; similarly , NF-κ B nuclear translocation was inhibited by P09683 . Moreover , the phosphorylation levels of various upstream signaling enzymes involved in NF-κB activation were decreased by P09683 treatment in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells . Finally , P09683 strongly inhibited Src kinase activity and also inhibited the autophosphorylation of overexpressed Src . Therefore , our data suggest that P09683 can block the inflammatory response by directly inhibiting Src kinase activity linked to NF-κB activation .
