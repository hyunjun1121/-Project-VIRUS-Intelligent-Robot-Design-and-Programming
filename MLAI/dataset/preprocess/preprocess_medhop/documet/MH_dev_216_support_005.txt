A cytokine-controlled mechanism for integrated regulation of T-lymphocyte motility , adhesion and activation . The co-ordination of T-cell motility , adhesion and activation remains poorly understood . It is also unclear how these functions are co-ordinated with external stimuli . Here we unveil a series of molecular interactions in cis at the surface of T lymphocytes with potent effects on motility and adhesion in these cells , and communicating with proliferative responses . These interactions were controlled by the signature cytokines of T helper subsets interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) and P05112 . P01130 -related protein 1 ( Q07954 ) was found to play a key role for T-cell motility by promoting development of polarized cell shape and cell movement . Endogenous thrombospondin-1 ( P07996 -1 ) enhanced cell surface expression of Q07954 through Q08722 . Cell surface expressed Q07954 induced motility and processing of P07996 -1 while inhibiting adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and fibronectin . P60568 , but not P05112 , stimulated synthesis of P07996 -1 and motility through P07996 -1 and Q07954 . Stimulation of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) /CD3 complex inhibited P07996 -1 expression . Inhibitor studies indicated that Q07954 regulated P07996 -1 expression and promoted motility through JAK signalling . This Q07954 -mediated motogenic signalling was connected to Q08722 /Gi protein signalling and P60568 -induced signalling through P07996 -1 . The motogenic P07996 -1/ Q07954 mechanism antagonized TCR/CD3-induced T-cell proliferation . These results indicate that Q07954 in collaboration with P07996 -1 directs a counter-adhesive and counter-proliferative motogenic cascade . T cells seem programmed to prioritize movement before adhesion through this cascade . In conclusion , vital decision-making in T lymphocytes regulating motility , adhesive interactions and proliferation , are integrated through a molecular mechanism connecting different cell surface receptors and their signalling pathways .
