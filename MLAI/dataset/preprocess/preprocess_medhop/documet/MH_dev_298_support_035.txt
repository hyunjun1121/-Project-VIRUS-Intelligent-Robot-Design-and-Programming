DB03758 activates heat shock protein expression and cardioprotection in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes . Heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) constitute an endogenous cellular defense mechanism against environmental stresses . In the past few years , studies have shown that overexpression of HSPs can protect cardiac myocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury . In an attempt to increase the HSPs in cardiac tissue , we used the compound radicicol that activates HSP expression by binding to the P08238 kDa ( HSP90 ) . HSP90 is the main component of the cytosolic molecular chaperone complex , which has been implicated in the regulation of the heat shock factor 1 ( Q00613 ) . Q00613 is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes . In the present study , we show that radicicol induces HSP expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes , and this increase in HSPs confers cardioprotection to these cardiomyocytes . We also show that radicicol induction of the HSP and cardioprotection is dependent on the inhibition of HSP90 in cardiomyocytes . These results indicate that modulation of the active HSP90 protein level plays an important role in cardioprotection . Therefore , compounds , such as radicicol and its possible derivatives that inhibit the function of HSP90 in the cell may represent potentially useful cardioprotective agents .
