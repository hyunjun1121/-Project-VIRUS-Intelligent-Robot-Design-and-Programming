Comparative linkage mapping of genes on sheep chromosome 3 provides evidence of chromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of the Bovidae . Three genes -- parathyroid hormone-like hormone ( P12272 ) , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF 1 ) , and retinoic acid receptor gamma ( P13631 ) -- have been mapped to sheep ( Ovis aries ) chromosome 3 ( OAR 3 ) . The order and genetic distances between loci on OAR 3 are similar to those on cattle ( Bos taurus ) chromosome 5 , as expected from their close evolutionary relationship . The OAR 3 linkage map shows conserved synteny with human chromosome 12 , but there are at least two rearrangements in gene order between the species .
