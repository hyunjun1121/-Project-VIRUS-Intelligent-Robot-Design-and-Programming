Association between type 2 diabetes genetic susceptibility loci and visceral and subcutaneous fat area as determined by computed tomography . Visceral fat accumulation has an important role in the development of several metabolic disorders , such as type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia and hypertension . New genetic loci that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes have been identified by genome-wide association studies . To examine the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci and visceral fat accumulation , we genotyped 1279 Japanese subjects ( 556 men and 723 women ) , who underwent computed tomography for measurements of visceral fat area ( VFA ) and subcutaneous fat area ( SFA ) for the following single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) : Q04721 rs10923931 , Q6YHU6 rs7578597 , P37231 rs1801282 , Q9P2N4 rs4607103 , Q9Y6M1 rs1470579 , P15692 rs9472138 , Q86VZ6 rs864745 , CDKN2A/ P42772 rs564398 and rs10811661 , Q03014 rs1111875 and rs5015480 , Q9NQB0 rs7901695 , P51787 rs2237892 , Q14654 rs5215 and rs5219 , Q93063 rs1113132 , rs11037909 , and rs3740878 , P49286 rs10830963 , P81605 rs1153188 , P19075 / O75473 rs7961581 , and Q9C0B1 rs8050136 and rs9939609 . None of the above SNPs were significantly associated with VFA . The Q9C0B1 rs8050136 and rs9939609 risk alleles exhibited significant associations with body mass index ( BMI ; P=0.00088 and P=0.0010 , respectively ) and SFA ( P=0.00013 and P=0.00017 , respectively ) . No other SNPs were significantly associated with BMI or SFA . Our results suggest that two SNPs in the Q9C0B1 gene are associated with subcutaneous fat accumulation . The contributions of other SNPs are inconclusive because of a limitation of the sample power .
