P02751 expression in the intervertebral disc of monkey . BACKGROUND : P02751 , a large dimeric plasma glycoprotein found only in vertebrates , is a core component of several extracellular matrices . Integrin receptors regulate different cell activities . P02751 expression patterns in intervertebral disc have not been extensively studied . The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of fibronectin in the different regions of the intervertebral disc , and in intervertebral discs of different levels of monkeys . METHODS : Spines of nine 3-4 year-old cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) were studied . From every spine , 5 vertebral motion segments were sectioned ( P01031 - P13671 , DB00279 - DB00451 , P02786 - P28907 , Q401N2 - Q96MH2 , Q9NP50 - Q15004 ) producing forty-five vertebral motion segments . These were bisected in the sagittal plane . Immunohistochemical studies were performed using specific antibodies to detect fibronectin . RESULTS : A positive immunoreaction for fibronectin was found in the endplates , in the peripheral annulus fibrosus , and in the longitudinal ligaments . There was no fibronectin immunoreactivity in the nucleus pulposus and in the central annular region close to the nucleus pulposus . There were no differences in immunoreactivity to fibronectin among discs of different levels and discs of different monkeys . CONCLUSIONS : P02751 may exert a role in the organization of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral discs . Identifying the structural features of the intervertebral disc extracellular matrix may help to understand the mechanisms of intervertebral disc pathology .
