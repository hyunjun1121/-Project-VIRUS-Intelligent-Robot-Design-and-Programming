Experimental models of neuroprotection relevant to multiple sclerosis . Activated T cells , particularly those of the T-helper ( Th ) 1 subset , have the capacity to kill neurons . Strategies for preventing such damage may include deviation of activated T cells into the Th2 subset ( e.g. , via use of glatiramer acetate ) , alteration of functional properties of Th1 cells ( e.g. , through use of interferon [ P27352 ] -beta or IV immunoglobulin ) , and inhibition of activated cell migration into the CNS ( e.g. , by employing P27352 -beta or natalizumab ) . P14780 ( P14780 ) also causes neuron death in neurotoxicity models , and examination of medications with MMP inhibitory activity indicates that minocycline is capable of preventing such damage . DB01017 also has other properties relevant to conferring neuroprotection , such as inhibition of microglial activity and apoptosis pathways . In a small pilot study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis , minocycline treatment produced favorable outcomes in terms of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and clinical course . Further studies are needed to establish whether experimental neuroprotection strategies involving these mechanisms may be translated into preventing neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis .
