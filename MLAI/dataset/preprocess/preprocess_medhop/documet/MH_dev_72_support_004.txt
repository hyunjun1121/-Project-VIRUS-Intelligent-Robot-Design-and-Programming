Unmet needs in ovarian cancer : dividing histologic subtypes to exploit novel targets and pathways . Ovarian cancer ( OC ) carries a poor prognosis ; however , accumulating molecular data for the major histologic subtypes may lead to subtype-specific treatment paradigms . The present review discusses what is currently understood about the major molecular and histologic subgroups of OC . Areas specifically addressed include hormonal pathways , tumor protein p53 ( P04637 ) and AT rich interactive domain 1A ( SWI-like ; O14497 ) mutation , and the breast cancer 1/2 , early onset ( P38398 /2 ) mutation/poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( P09874 ) , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3- kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PI3KCA ) /v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( P31749 ) /mechanistic target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) , and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 ( Q02750 /2 ) pathways . This molecular characterization only very recently has impacted clinical research efforts to develop targeted therapies for both common and rare OC subtypes . This targeted strategy is illustrated by ongoing low-grade serous , clear-cell , and mucinous subtypeexclusive clinical trials evaluating agents based on common molecular abnormalities among patients ( i.e. , P09874 inhibitors for P38398 /2 mutation-positive OC ) . This report also reviews the published clinical trial efficacy data for investigational therapies within specific subgroups , and summarizes the currently active clinical trials evaluating these agents ( e.g. , temsirolimus , sunitinib , P04637 immunotherapy , olaparib , iniparib , veliparib ) . Available data suggest that histologic profiles and molecular tumor markers are valuable resources for identifying patients who may benefit from these specific agents , and future research should focus on targeting molecules and signaling pathways that are most commonly altered in each subtype .
