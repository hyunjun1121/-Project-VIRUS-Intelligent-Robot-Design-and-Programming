Hyper-IgM , neutropenia , mild infections and low response to polyclonal stimulation : hyper-IgM syndrome or common variable immunodeficiency ? A young woman presenting respiratory infections , polyarthritis , severe neutropenia , and increased serum IgM was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) with good clinical and laboratory outcome followed by a loss of efficacy . The increased serum IgM associated to recurrent infections and autoimmune manifestations suggested the diagnosis of a hyper-IgM syndrome ( HIGMs ) . The frequency of peripheral T cells , the expression of P25942 on the patients ' B cells and P29965 on T cells and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( Q9GZX7 ) and uracil-DNA glycosylase ( P13051 ) at mRNA level was comparable to controls . In contrast , the frequency of B cells was one half of the healthy control and all cells showed an atypical phenotype . Although Q9GZX7 and P13051 were normal , class-switch recombination was not very efficient because circulating switched memory were reduced and , once stimulated with CpG , generated less antibody-secreting cells than controls . An increase in serum B Lymphocytes stimulator ( Q9Y275 ) was also found . The patient presented a peculiar clinical and immunological phenotype fitting for many aspects of both HIGM4 and Common Variable Immunodeficiency ( CVID ) . These findings underline the need to better explore the complex link between these two diseases .
