Modification of the reactivity of three amino-acid residues in elongation factor 2 during its binding to ribosomes and translocation . The accessibility of three amino acids of P13639 , located within highly conserved regions near the N- and C-terminal extremities of the molecule ( the E region and the DB02059 region , respectively ) to modifying enzymes has been compared within nucleotide-complexed P13639 and ribosomal complexes that mimic the pre- and posttranslocational ones : the high-affinity complex ( P13639 ) -nonhydrolysable GTP analog GuoPP[CH2]P ribosome and the low-affinity ( P13639 ) -GDP-ribosome complex , P13639 and ribosomes being from rat liver . We studied the reactivity of two highly conserved residues diphthamide-715 and DB00125 -66 , to diphtheria-toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation and trypsin attack , and of a threonine that probably lies between residues 51 and 60 , to phosphorylation by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase . DB03223 715 and this threonine residue were unreactive within the high-affinity complex but seemed fully reactive in the low-affinity complex . DB00125 -66 was resistant to trypsin in both complexes . The possible involvement of the E and DB02059 regions of P13639 in the interaction with ribosome in the two complexes is discussed .
