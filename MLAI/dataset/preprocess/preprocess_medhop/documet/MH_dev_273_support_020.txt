Possible regulation of migration of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells by interaction of P61073 expressed in carcinoma cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and stromal-derived factor-1 released in stroma . Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) is highly fatal because of early invasion , widespread metastasis , and lack of an effective therapy . We examined roles of P61073 and its ligand , stromal cell-derived factor ( SDF ) -1 , in migration of ICC with respect to tumor-stromal interaction by using two ICC cell lines , a fibroblast cell line ( WI-38 ) , and 28 human ICC tissues . The two ICC cell lines expressed P61073 mRNA and protein , and WI-38 fibroblasts expressed P48061 mRNA and protein . Migration of cultured ICC cells in Matrigel was induced by co-culture with WI-38 fibroblasts and by incubation with P48061 . Anti- P48061 antibody suppressed migration , demonstrating that P48061 released from WI-38 fibroblasts was responsible for this migration . P01375 ( P01375 ) -alpha pretreatment of ICC cells up-regulated P61073 mRNA and protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner . Administration of P48061 and P01375 increased synergistically ICC cell migration , which was suppressed by the P61073 antagonist DB06809 . In ICC tissue , P01375 was mainly expressed in infiltrated macrophages , P61073 in ICC cells , and P48061 in stromal fibroblasts . In conclusion , the interaction of P48061 released from fibroblasts and P61073 expressed on ICC cells may be actively involved in ICC migration , and P01375 may enhance ICC cell migration by increasing P61073 expression . P61073 could be a therapeutic target to prevent ICC invasion .
