[ DB00707 sodium ( Photofrin-II ) ] . DB00707 sodium ( DB00707 ) is a photosensitizer which distributes selectively to tumor tissues , and causes tumor cell death by combination with light irradiation . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) by combination of porfimer sodium and laser was developed as a new cancer therapy . Tumor selectivity of porfimer sodium are based on the following reasons ; 1 ) high affinity for lipoprotein , especially , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , 2 ) elevation of P01130 activity in cancer tissue , and 3 ) lack or imcompleteness of lymphatic system in cancer tissue . DB00707 sodium is activated by laser irradiation at 630 nm , which can reacts with tissue oxygen to produce highly reactive excited siglet oxygen ( 1O2 ) . This highly reactive molecule is subsequently capable of killing tumor cells through oxidation of cellular component like mitochondrial enzymes . In addition , this highly reactive intermediate causes destruction of the tumor capillaries , which accelerates tumor cell death . The growth suppression or lethal damage to tumor cells by PDT of porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser were observed in experimental tumor models . In human clinical trials , the rates of complete response ( CR ) for roentgenographically occult lung cancer , stage I lung cancer , superficial esophageal cancer , superficial gastric cancer and carcinoma in situ or dysplasia of the cervix were 84.8 % , 50.0 % , 90.0 % , 87.5 % and 94.4 % , respectively . The major side effects were cutaneous symptoms e.g. photosensitivity , pigmentation , increasing GOT , GPT but these symptoms were not severe . PDT using porfimer sodium and excimer dye laser must be clinically useful for the treatment of inoperable early cancer or conservation of organ functions .
