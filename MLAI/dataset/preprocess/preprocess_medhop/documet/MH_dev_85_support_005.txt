Novel MEK inhibitor trametinib and other retinoblastoma gene ( RB ) -reactivating agents enhance efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on human colon cancer cells . Chemotherapy for colorectal cancer has become more complicated and diversified with the appearance of molecular-targeting agents . DB00544 ( DB00544 ) has been a mainstay of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer , but it is still unknown whether the combining of DB00544 with novel molecular-targeting agents is effective . P04818 ( TS ) is a direct target of DB00544 , and the low TS level has been generally supposed to sensitize DB00544 's efficacy . We therefore hypothesized that RB-reactivating agents could enhance the efficacy of DB00544 , because the RB-reactivating agents could suppress the function of transcription factor E2F of TS gene promoter . We used three RB-reactivating agents , trametinib/GSK1120212 ( MEK inhibitor ) , fenofibrate ( Q07869 Î± agonist ) , and LY294002 ( PI3K inhibitor ) , with DB00544 against human colon cancer HT-29 and HCT15 cells . DB08911 induced p15 and p27 expression and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells . Fenofibrate also dephosphorlated P27361 /2 and reduced cyclin D1 levels in HT-29 cells . LY294002 induced p27 expression in HCT15 cells . All three agents caused dephosphorylation of RB protein and P55008 -phase arrest with a reduction of TS expression . As a consequence , the combination of DB00544 with each of the agents resulted in a significant decrease of colony numbers in HT-29 or HCT15 cells . These results suggest " RB-reactivation therapy " using molecular-targeting agents to be a new strategy for DB00544 -based chemotherapy . In particular , we strongly expect trametinib , which was discovered in Japan and was recently submitted to FDA for approval , to be used together with established regimens for colorectal cancer .
