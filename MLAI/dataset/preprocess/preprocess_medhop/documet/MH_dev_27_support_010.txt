Interaction of tacrolimus(FK506) and its metabolites with FKBP and calcineurin . DB00864 (FK506) is a strong immuno-suppressant and shows its activity through inhibiting P60568 mRNA transcription by forming pentameric complex with intracellular receptor ( FK506 binding protein 12 kDa or P62942 ) , Ca2+ , calmodulin , and calcineurin . Here , we report the binding activity to P62942 , the pentameric complex formation and Con-A response inhibiting activities of 7 metabolites . C15-demethylated metabolite(M-3) needed higher quantity to compete in Con-A assay and in pentamer formation assay , although it binds more strongly to P62942 . The result suggests that the ability to form a pentameric complex is not a two step reaction with the first binding to P62942 , but a single step reaction by components for the pentamer formation .
