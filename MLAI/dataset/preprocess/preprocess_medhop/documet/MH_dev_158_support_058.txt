P62937 regulates HIV-1 infectivity , as demonstrated by gene targeting in human T cells . The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Gag polyprotein binds most members of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases . Of 15 known human cyclophilins , cyclophilin A ( CypA ) has been the focus of investigation because it was detected in HIV-1 virions . To determine whether CypA promotes HIV-1 replication , we deleted the gene encoding CypA ( P62937 ) in human P01730 (+) T cells by homologous recombination . HIV-1 replication in P62937 (-/-) cells was decreased and not inhibited further by cyclosporin or gag mutations that disrupt Gag 's interaction with cyclophilins , indicating that no other cyclophilin family members promote HIV-1 replication . The defective replication phenotype was specific for wild-type HIV-1 since HIV-2/SIV isolates , as well as HIV-1 bearing a gag mutation that confers cyclosporin resistance , replicated the same in P62937 (+/+) and P62937 (-/-) cells . Stable re-expression of CypA in P62937 (-/-) cells restored HIV-1 replication to an extent that correlated with steady-state levels of CypA . Finally , virions from P62937 (-/-) cells possessed no obvious biochemical abnormalities but were less infectious than virions from wild-type cells . These data formally demonstrate that CypA regulates the infectivity of HIV-1 virions .
