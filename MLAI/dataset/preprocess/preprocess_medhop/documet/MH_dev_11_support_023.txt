Absolute bioavailability and effect of formulation change , food , or elevated pH with rabeprazole on cobimetinib absorption in healthy subjects . DB05239 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of Q02750 /2 . Since cobimetinib exhibited absorption variability in cancer patients , a series of single-dose studies in healthy subjects were conducted to determine absolute bioavailability and elucidate potential effects of formulation , food , and elevated gastric pH on cobimetinib bioavailability . Three crossover trials were performed with a 20 mg cobimetinib oral dose : absolute bioavailability using a 2 mg intravenous infusion ( n = 13 ) , relative bioavailability of tablets versus capsules and food effect ( n = 20 ) , and drug interaction with a proton pump inhibitor ( 20 mg of rabeprazole daily for 5 days prior to cobimetinib administration ; n = 20 ) . Absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib was 46.2 % ( 24.2 , CV % ) , likely due to metabolism rather than incomplete absorption . The mean systemic clearance of cobimetinib was low ( 11.7 L/h [ 28.2 , CV % ] ) . Administration of cobimetinib tablets with a high-fat meal delayed drug absorption ( prolonged tmax ) but had no statistically significant effect on cobimetinib exposure ( Cmax and AUC0-∞ ) . Tablet and capsule formulations of cobimetinib showed comparable exposures . DB05239 exhibited delayed absorption ( tmax ) in the presence of rabeprazole , with no statistically significant effects on drug exposure ( Cmax and AUC0-∞ ) in the fasted state . In conclusion , cobimetinib oral absorption was not affected by change in formulation , food , or elevated gastric pH .
