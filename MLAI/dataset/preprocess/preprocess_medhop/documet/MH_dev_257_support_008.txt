DB00171 induces synaptic gene expressions in cortical neurons : transduction and transcription control via P47900 receptors . Studies in vertebrate neuromuscular synapses have revealed previously that DB00171 , via P2Y receptors , plays a critical role in regulating postsynaptic gene expressions . An equivalent regulatory role of DB00171 and its P2Y receptors would not necessarily be expected for the very different situation of the brain synapses , but we provide evidence here for a brain version of that role . In cultured cortical neurons , the expression of P2Y(1) receptors increased sharply during neuronal differentiation . Those receptors were found mainly colocalized with the postsynaptic scaffold postsynaptic density protein 95 ( P78352 ) . This arises through a direct interaction of a PDZ domain of P78352 with the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif , D-T-S-L of the P2Y(1) receptor , confirmed by the full suppression of the colocalization upon mutation of two amino acids therein . This interaction is effective in recruiting P78352 to the membrane . Specific activation of P2Y(1) ( G-protein-coupled ) receptors induced the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ P04049 signaling cascade . This led to distinct up-regulation of the genes encoding acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 (T) variant ) , choline acetyltransferase , and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit Q12879 . This was confirmed , in the example of P22303 , to arise from P2Y(1)-dependent stimulation of a human P22303 gene promoter . That involved activation of the transcription factor Elk-1 ; mutagenesis of the P22303 promoter revealed that Elk-1 binding at its specific responsive elements in that promoter was induced by P2Y(1) receptor activation . The combined findings reveal that DB00171 , via its P2Y(1) receptor , can act trophically in brain neurons to regulate the gene expression of direct effectors of synaptic transmission .
