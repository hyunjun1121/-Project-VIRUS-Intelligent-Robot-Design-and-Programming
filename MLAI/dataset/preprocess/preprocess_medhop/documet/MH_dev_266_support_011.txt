P01308 -like growth factor-I is a serum component stimulating growth of human neuroblastoma . Human non-autocrine neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH and LF require serum for proliferation in vitro . We wished to determine the role of serum-borne insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) as mitogen for these cells . Introduction of the monoclonal antibody alpha-IR3 against human P08069 reduced proliferation in the presence of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . P05019 ( 5 nM ) was as effective as FBS ( 10 % ) in stimulating proliferation . DB00071 mimicked the effects of P05019 , but at a 1000-fold higher concentration . The antibody alpha-IR3 reduced growth stimulated by P05019 more effectively than growth stimulated by insulin . Thus , proliferation of human non-autocrine neuroblastoma cells can be effectively manipulated by exogenous P05019 .
