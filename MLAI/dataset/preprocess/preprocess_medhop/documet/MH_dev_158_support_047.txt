Evidences of monomer , dimer and trimer of recombinant human cyclophilin A . P62937 ( CyPA ) is a cytosolic receptor of immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) which possesses peptidyl-prodyl cis/trans isomerase ( PPIase ) activity . The recombinant human CyPA ( rhCyPA ) gene has been expressed in E. coli M15 . Purification was performed using salting-out , as well as Sephacryl S-100 and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography . The molecular weight is about 18 kDa , confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrum . The results of Native-PAGE and immunoblotting showed the existence of three bands , which agreed well with the gel filtration results . The molecular mass of the three bands determined via CTAB gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE ( rhCyPA cross-linked with glutaraldehyde ) was 18 kDa , 36 kDa and 54 kDa respectively . Further more , the native rhCyPA and the cross-linked rhCyPA had the similar chromatographic behavior in gel filtration . All of the evidences above suggest that rhCyPA exists in forms of monomer , dimer and trimer . Moreover , we observed that even at low protein concentrations CyPA largely occurs as a dimer in solution , and enzyme kinetic parameters showed that activity of dimer was much higher than monomer or trimer , which probably have some biological significances .
