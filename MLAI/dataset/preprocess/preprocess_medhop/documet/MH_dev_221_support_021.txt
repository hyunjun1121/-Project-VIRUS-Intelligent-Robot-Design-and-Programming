Phenotypical and functional study of ghrelin and its receptor in the pathogenesis of Crohn 's disease . BACKGROUND : Ghrelin , a novel endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( Q92847 ) , has been demonstrated to possess multiple functions including antiinflammatory effects . The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ghrelin and Q92847 and the function of ghrelin in inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . METHODS : The expression of ghrelin and Q92847 mRNA was quantified in mucosal biopsy specimens from 9 controls , 15 patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , and 15 patients with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The locations of ghrelin and Q92847 were investigated immunohistochemically in surgically resected specimens . We also evaluated the percentage of Q92847 -positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in healthy controls and patients with CD by flow cytometry . In addition , we investigated the immunoregulatory function of ghrelin in peripheral blood T cells . RESULTS : Ghrelin mRNA levels in colonic mucosa of Q9UKU7 were higher than control level . The Q92847 -1a mRNA level in active CD was also significantly higher than the control level . Ghrelin and Q92847 -1a were expressed on CD3- and P34810 -positive cells . The percentage of Q92847 -1a-positive peripheral blood T cells in patients with CD was significantly higher than the control level . Stimulation of human T cells with ghrelin increased levels of P05112 and P35225 proteins and decreased levels of P01579 protein . Reactivity to ghrelin was low in CD compared with the control level . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings demonstrate that ghrelin may play an important role in the immune system in CD . The dysregulation of reactivity of T cells induced by ghrelin suggests that ghrelin might participate in the pathogenesis of CD .
