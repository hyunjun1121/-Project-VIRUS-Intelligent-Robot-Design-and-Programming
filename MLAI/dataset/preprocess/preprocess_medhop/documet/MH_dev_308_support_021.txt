Endocytosis of the vasopressin receptor by anterior pituitary cells is increased by DB05394 ( CRF ) . Endocytosis of certain receptors such as the transferrin receptor and the P01133 -receptor appears to be influenced by second messengers . If second messengers are involved in modulation of endocytosis , not only endocytosis of the stimulated receptor itself but also of receptors for other ligands on the cell surface may be influenced by receptor occupancy . P06850 ( CRF ) and vasopressin act synergistically on secretion of DB01285 from the anterior pituitary . The results presented here demonstrate that CRF increases retrieval of the vasopressin receptor in anterior pituitary cells in primary culture without influencing the surface binding of vasopressin . This is not a function of an increased membrane turnover since endocytosis of the transferrin receptor is not influenced by CRF .
