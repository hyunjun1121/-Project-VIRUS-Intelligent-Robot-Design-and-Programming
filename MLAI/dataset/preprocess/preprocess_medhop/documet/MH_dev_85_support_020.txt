Complex regulation of CDKs and P55008 arrest during the granulocytic differentiation of human myeloblastic leukemia Q9NTI2 cells . We previously reported that all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) synergistically induced granulocytic differentiation in human myeloblastic leukemia Q9NTI2 cells . The combination of these agents also suppressed DNA-synthesis . In the present study , we investigated the suppression of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) activities resulting in P55008 arrest in differentiated Q9NTI2 cells . We show that treatment of Q9NTI2 cells with DB00755 plus P04141 results in P55008 arrest and suppression of CDK activities . Protein levels of the P55008 CDKs were essentially unchanged during this time . However , we observed an increase in P24941 -bound p27 and P11802 -bound p18 , and a decrease in Q00534 -bound cyclin D3 . These results suggest that complex regulation of CDKs play a key role in P55008 arrest of Q9NTI2 after treatment with DB00755 and GM- P04141 . We also showed that an increase in P24941 -bound p27 and P11802 -bound p18 are caused by treatment with DB00755 and a decrease in Q00534 -bound cyclin D3 is induced synergistically by treatment with both reagents . Furthermore , we propose that the changes in binding of p18 and cyclin D3 to CDKs are due to changes at the protein expression level and that the increase in p27 binding to P24941 is due to a novel mechanism .
