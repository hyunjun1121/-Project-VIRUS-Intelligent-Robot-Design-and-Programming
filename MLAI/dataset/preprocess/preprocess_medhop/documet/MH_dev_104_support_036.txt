DB01240 ( P06744 ) receptor binding and cyclic AMP synthesis activities of PGI1 analogues , SM-10906 and its methyl ester , SM-10902 , in mastocytoma P-815 cells . The prostacyclin I1 ( PGI1 ) analogue , SM-10906 and its methyl ester , SM-10902 , have been compared with the DB01240 analogue , iloprost , with respect to binding to the P43119 , stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and inhibition of thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization in mastocytoma P-815 cells . SM-10906 displaced [3H]iloprost binding to the membrane fraction , the IC50 value being 100 nM , but showed very low affinity for the prostaglandin E ( PGE ) receptor . SM-10906 dose-dependently stimulated GTP-dependent adenylate cyclase activity in the membrane fraction , the EC50 value being 35 nM . Furthermore , SM-10906 prevented a thrombin-induced increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration , the IC50 value being 300 nM . These IC50 and EC50 values are much lower than those of SM-10902 . These results demonstrate that SM-10906 , a stable PGI1 derivative , is an agonist for the [3H]iloprost-binding ( DB01240 ) receptor , and that it prevents thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization through stimulation of the adenylate cyclase system in mastocytoma cells . On the other hand , a methyl ester derivative of PGI1 , SM-10902 , was inactive in the binding assay , but it seems to be a partial agonist for adenylate cyclase activity [ corrected ] .
