Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in tumour and stroma compartments in cervical cancer : clinical implications . This study aims at investigating the relationship between cyclooxygenase-2 expression in tumour vs stroma inflammatory compartment and its possible clinical role . The study included 99 stage IB-IV cervical cancer patients : immunostaining of tumour tissue sections was performed with rabbit antiserum against cyclooxygenase-2 . CD3 , P01730 , CD8 , CD25 , Mast Cell Tryptase monoclonal antibodies were used to characterise stroma inflammatory cells in nine cervical tumours . An inverse relation was found between cyclooxygenase-2 levels ( cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ) of tumour vs stroma compartment ( r=-0.44 , P < 0.0001 ) . The percentage of cases showing high tumour/stromal cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ratio was significantly higher in patients who did not respond to treatment ( 93.3 % ) with respect to patients with partial ( 60.5 % ) , and complete ( 43.7 % ) response ( P= 0.009 ) . Cases with a high tumour/stroma cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ratio had a shorter overall survival rate than cases with a low tumour/stroma cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ( P < 0.0001 ) . In the multivariate analysis advanced stage and the status of tumour/stroma cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ratio retained an independent negative prognostic role . The proportion of CD3(+) , P01730 (+) , and CD25(+) cells was significantly lower in tumours with high tumour/stroma cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ratio , while a higher percentage of mast cells was detected in tumours showing high tumour/stroma cyclooxygenase-2 IDV ratio . Our study showed the usefulness of assessing cyclooxygenase-2 status both in tumour and stroma compartment in order to identify cervical cancer patients endowed with a very poor chance of response to neoadjuvant therapy and unfavourable prognosis .
