Targeting PIM kinases impairs survival of hematopoietic cells transformed by kinase inhibitor-sensitive and kinase inhibitor-resistant forms of P36888 and P11274 / P00519 . Previous studies have shown that activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( P42229 ) plays an essential role in leukemogenesis mediated through constitutive activated protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) . Because PIM-1 is a P42229 target gene , we analyzed the role of the family of PIM serine/threonine kinases ( PIM-1 to PIM-3 ) in PTK-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells . Ba/ P13726 cells transformed to growth factor independence by various oncogenic PTKs ( P41212 / O60674 , P41212 / Q16288 , P41212 / P00519 , P11274 / P00519 , P36888 -ITD , and H4/PDGFbetaR ) show abundant expression of PIM-1 and PIM-2 . Suppression of PIM-1 activity had a negligible effect on transformation . In contrast , expression of kinase-dead PIM-2 mutant ( PIM-2KD ) led to a rapid decline of survival in Ba/ P13726 cells transformed by P36888 -ITD but not by other oncogenic PTKs tested . Coexpression of PIM-1KD and PIM-2KD abrogated growth factor-independent growth of Ba/ P13726 transformed by several PTKs , including P11274 / P00519 . Targeted down-regulation of PIM-2 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) selectively abrogated survival of Ba/ P13726 cells transformed by various P36888 ( P36888 ) -activating mutants [ internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) and kinase domain ] and attenuated growth of human cell lines containing P36888 mutations . Interestingly , cells transformed by P36888 and P11274 / P00519 mutations that confer resistance to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors were still sensitive to knockdown of PIM-2 , or PIM-1 and PIM-2 by RNAi . Our observations indicate that combined inactivation of PIM-1 and PIM-2 interferes with oncogenic PTKs and suggest that PIMs are alternative therapeutic targets in PTK-mediated leukemia . Targeting the PIM kinase family could provide a new avenue to overcome resistance against small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
