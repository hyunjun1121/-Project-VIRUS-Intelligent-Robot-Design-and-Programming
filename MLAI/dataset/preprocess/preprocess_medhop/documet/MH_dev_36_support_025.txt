Investigation of Q13639 receptors in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in cigarette smoke-exposed mice . BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) arises from an interaction between genetic host factors and environmental exposures ( mainly cigarette smoke ( CS ) ) . Genome Wide Association studies have demonstrated that genetic variations in the gene encoding 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptors ( 5-HT(4)R ) , Q13639 , were associated with measures of airway obstruction and with P48444 . We hypothesised that 5-HT(4) receptors , in addition to 5-HT2AR and muscarinic receptors , contribute to the pathogenesis of P48444 by facilitating cholinergic bronchoconstriction . METHODS : The levels of pulmonary 5-HT(4)R mRNA were measured in CS-exposed mice by qRT-PCR . We investigated the effect of CS exposure on bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) to 5-HT and evaluated the contribution of 5-HT2AR , muscarinic receptors and 5-HT(4)R in the response to 5-HT by using the corresponding antagonists and 5-HT(4)R knockout ( KO ) mice . RESULTS : The 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels were significantly elevated upon acute ( 3 days ) , subacute ( 4 weeks ) and chronic ( 24 weeks ) CS exposure . Both acute and subacute CS exposure significantly increased BHR to 5-HT . Antagonism of 5-HT2AR abolished the CS-induced BHR to 5-HT , and antagonism of muscarinic receptors significantly reduced the response to 5-HT . However , pre-treatment with GR113808 , a specific 5-HT(4)R antagonist , did not alter the response to 5-HT in CS-exposed mice . Accordingly , the CS-induced BHR to 5-HT was not different between wild-type and 5-HT(4)R KO mice . CONCLUSION : CS increased the levels of 5-HT(4)R mRNA in the lungs , concomitantly with bronchial responsiveness to 5-HT . Our in vivo data using pharmacologic and genetic approaches suggest that 5-HT(4) receptors are not involved in the BHR to 5-HT in CS-exposed mice .
