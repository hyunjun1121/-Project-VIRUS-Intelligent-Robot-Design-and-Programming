Differential role of two P11473 coactivators , Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 , in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . Cell programs such as proliferation and differentiation involve the selective activation and repression of gene expression . The vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , through 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) , controls the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes . Previously , we have identified two P11473 binding coactivator complexes . In proliferating keratinocytes P11473 bound preferentially to the DRIP complex , whereas in differentiated keratinocytes the P12931 complex was preferred . We proposed that different coactivators are required for sequential gene regulation in the transition from proliferation to differentiation . Here we examined the roles of Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 in this transition . Silencing of Q15648 and P11473 caused hyperproliferation of keratinocytes , demonstrated by increased XTT and BrdU incorporation . Q9Y6Q9 silencing , on the other hand , did not have an effect on proliferation . In contrast , Q9Y6Q9 as well as Q15648 and P11473 silencing blocked keratinocyte differentiation as shown by decreased expression of keratin 1 and filaggrin . These results are consistent with the differential localization of Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 in skin . These results indicate that Q15648 is required for keratinocyte proliferation . Both Q15648 and Q9Y6Q9 are required for the keratinocyte differentiation . These results support the concept that the selective use of coactivators by P11473 underlies the selective regulation of gene expression in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation .
