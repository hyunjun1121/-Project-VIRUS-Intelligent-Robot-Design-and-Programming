Changes of several brain receptor complexes in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer disease : probable new potential pharmaceutical targets . Although Alzheimer disease ( AD ) has been linked to defects in major brain receptors , studies thus far have been limited to the determination of receptor subunits or specific ligand binding studies . However , the availability of current technology enables the determination and quantification of brain receptor complexes . Thus , we examined levels of native receptor complexes in the brains of patients with AD . Cortical tissue was obtained from control subjects ( n = 12 females and 12 males ) and patients with AD ( n = 12 females and 12 males ) within a 3-h postmortem time period . The tissues were kept frozen until further biochemical analyses . Membrane proteins were extracted and subsequently enriched by ultracentrifugation using a sucrose gradient . Membrane proteins were then electrophoresed onto native gels and immunoblotted using antibodies against individual brain receptors . We found that the levels were comparable for complexes containing GluR2 , GluR3 and P48058 as well as P08908 . Moreover , the levels of complexes containing muscarinic AChR M1 , Q9UHB4 and GluR1 were significantly increased in male patients with AD . Nicotinic AChRs 4 and 7 as well as dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2 were also increased in males and females with AD . These findings reveal a pattern of altered receptor complex levels that may contribute to the deterioration of the concerted activity of these receptors and thus result in cognitive deficits observed in patients with AD . It should be emphasised that receptor complexes function as working units rather than individual subunits . Thus , the receptor deficits identified may be relevant for the design of experimental therapies . Therefore , specific pharmacological modulation of these receptors is within the pharmaceutical repertoire .
