Transcriptional modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission genes by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in neuroblastoma cells . Histone deacetylase inhibitors are promising anti-tumor agents partly due to their ability to disrupt the hypoxic signaling pathway in human malignancies . However , little is known about any effects of these drugs on the central nervous system . The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of trichostatin A ( P32119 ) -- a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitor -- on the transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in dopamine- and serotonergic neurotransmission . To this end , short-term parallel cultures of SK-NF-I neuroblastoma cells were treated with P32119 either alone or in combination with hypoxia , and mRNA levels of dopamine receptor D3 ( P35462 ) and D4 ( P21917 ) , dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) , dopamine hydroxylase ( P09172 ) , dopamine receptor regulating factor ( DRRF ) , catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) , serotonin receptor 1A ( P08908 ) , monoamino oxidase A ( P21397 ) , serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 ( Q8IWU9 ) were determined by quantitative PCR . We found that P32119 did not antagonize the hypoxia-induced activation of D3 and D4 dopamine receptor genes , implying that induction of these genes is not mediated directly by hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha . On the other hand , P32119 dramatically upregulated the expression of Q01959 and P31645 ( 45-fold and 15-fold , respectively ) , while transcript levels of P21397 and P21964 were significantly reduced ( by 70 % and by more than 90 % , respectively ) . Induction of Q01959 protein expression was detected by western blotting . These results suggest that inhibition of histone deacetylases might help restore presynaptic monoamine pools via suppression of catecholamine breakdown and facilitation of monoamine reuptake in neurons .
