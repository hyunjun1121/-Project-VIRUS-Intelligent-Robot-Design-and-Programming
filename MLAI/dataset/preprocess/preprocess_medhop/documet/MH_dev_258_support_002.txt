TATA-driven transcriptional initiation and regulation of the rat serotonin P08908 receptor gene . The transcriptional initiation and regulation of the rat serotonin P08908 receptor gene were characterized . By three types of analyses , a single brain-specific site of transcriptional initiation was localized to -967 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon that is utilized both in hippocampus and in the rat raphe RN46A cell line . This major site of transcriptional initiation was located 58 bp downstream from a consensus TATA element , suggesting TATA-driven transcription of the rat P08908 receptor . To identify the promoter activity of the receptor gene , progressive 5' deletions of the -2,719/-117-bp fragment of the P08908 promoter linked to luciferase gene were transfected into P08908 -negative ( pituitary GH4C1 , Q9BTT4 myoblast , and P13671 glioma ) and P08908 -positive ( septal SN-48 and raphe RN46A ) cell lines . Enhancer regions were identified within a fragment between nucleotides -426 and -117 that selectively enhanced transcription in P08908 -positive cells . A nonselective enhancer/promoter that mediated expression in all cell lines was located upstream between -1,519 and -426 bp in a DNA segment containing consensus TATA , CCAAT , SP-1 , and AP-1 elements as well as a poly-GT26 dinucleotide repeat . Strong repression of transcription in all cell lines was conferred by the region upstream of -1,519 bp that contains a 152-bp DNA segment with > 80 % identity to RANTES , tumor necrosis factor-beta , and other immune system genes . Our results indicate that TATA-driven expression of the P08908 receptor is regulated by a novel proximal tissue-specific enhancer region , a nonselective promoter , and an upstream repressor region that is distinct from previously identified neuron-specific repressors .
