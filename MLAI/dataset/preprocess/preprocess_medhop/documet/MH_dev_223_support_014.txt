Relative contributions of O95477 and Q8WTV0 to cholesterol efflux to serum from fibroblasts and macrophages . OBJECTIVE : DB04540 efflux is achieved by several mechanisms . This study examines contributions of these pathways to efflux to human serum . METHODS AND RESULTS : Human fibroblasts were stably transfected with Q8WTV0 while O95477 was upregulated . Quantitation of cholesterol efflux to human serum demonstrated that there was efflux from cells without either protein . Expression of O95477 produced a small increase in efflux , whereas Q8WTV0 expression had a dramatic impact . To quantitate O95477 and Q8WTV0 contribution , fibroblasts were pretreated with DB01599 and Q15722 -1 to , respectively , inhibit these efflux proteins . Exposing Q8WTV0 -expressing fibroblasts to Q15722 -1 inhibited efflux by 67 % . DB01599 pretreatment of O95477 -expressing fibroblasts reduced efflux to serum by 26 % . A large fraction of total efflux was uninhibited . For both J774 and mouse peritoneal macrophages , contributions of either O95477 or Q8WTV0 to efflux to serum were low , with background/uninhibited efflux contributing from 70 % to 90 % of total efflux . CONCLUSIONS : We have shown that O95477 -mediated efflux to serum responds to the pool of lipid-free/poor apolipoproteins , whereas phospholipid-containing particles mediate Q8WTV0 efflux . Although Q8WTV0 and O95477 contribute to efflux from fibroblasts and cholesterol-enriched macrophages , a large proportion of the total efflux to human serum is mediated by a mechanism that is neither Q8WTV0 nor O95477 .
