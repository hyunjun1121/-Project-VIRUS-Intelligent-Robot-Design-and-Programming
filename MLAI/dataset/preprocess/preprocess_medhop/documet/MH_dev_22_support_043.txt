Modeling the efficacy of trastuzumab-DM1 , an antibody drug conjugate , in mice . DB05773 ( DB05773 ) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate under investigation for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . One challenge in oncologic drug development is determining the optimal dose and treatment schedule . A novel dose regimen-finding strategy was developed for DB05773 using experimental data and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling . To characterize the disposition of DB05773 , pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in athymic nude and beige nude mice . The pharmacokinetics of DB05773 were described well by a two-compartment model . Tumor response data were obtained from single-dose , multiple-dose and time-dose-fractionation studies of DB05773 in animal models of P04626 -positive breast cancer , specifically engineered to be insensitive to trastuzumab . A sequential population-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approach was developed to describe the anti-tumor activity of DB05773 . A cell-cycle-phase nonspecific tumor cell kill model incorporating transit compartments captured well the features of tumor growth and the activity of DB05773 . Key findings of the model were that tumor cell growth rate played a significant role in the sensitivity of tumors to DB05773 ; anti-tumor activity was schedule independent ; and tumor response was linked to the ratio of exposure to a concentration required for tumor stasis .
