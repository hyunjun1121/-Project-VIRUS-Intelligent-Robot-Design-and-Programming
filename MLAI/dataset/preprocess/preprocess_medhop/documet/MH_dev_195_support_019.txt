Vascular endothelial growth factor trap-eye and trap technology : DB08885 from bench to bedside . Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) currently used to treat eye diseases have included monoclonal antibodies , antibody fragments , and an aptamer . A different method of achieving P15692 blockade in retinal diseases includes the concept of a cytokine trap . Cytokine traps technology are being evaluated for the treatment of various diseases that are driven by excessive cytokine levels . Traps consist of two extracellular cytokine receptor domains fused together to form a human immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . DB08885 / P15692 trap-eye ( VTE ) is a soluble fusion protein , which combines ligand-binding elements taken from the extracellular components of P15692 receptors 1 and 2 fused to the Fc portion of IgG . This protein contains all human amino acid sequences , which minimizes the potential for immunogenicity in human patients . This review presents the latest data on VTE in regard to the pharmacokinetics , dosage and safety , preclinical and clinical experiences . Method of the literature search : A systematic search of the literature was conducted on PubMed , Scopus , and Google Scholar with no limitation on language or year of publication databases . It was oriented to articles published for VTE in preclinical and clinical studies and was focused on the pharmacokinetics , dosage and safety of VTE .
