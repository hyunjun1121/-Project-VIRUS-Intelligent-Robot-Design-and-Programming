Biodistribution of 131I- , 186Re- , 177Lu- , and 88Y-labeled hLL2 ( DB04958 ) in nude mice with P20273 -positive lymphoma . Radioimmunotherapy ( Q92963 ) is a new and effective treatment modality in patients with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) hLL2 ( epratuzumab ) , a humanized mAb directed against the P20273 antigen , and which internalizes , can be labeled with various radionuclides . The biodistribution of hLL2 labeled with (131)I , (186)Re , (177)Lu , and (88)Y was studied in nude mice with subcutaneous human lymphoma xenografts in order to determine the most suitable of these four radionuclides for Q92963 with hLL2 . METHODS : Human Ramos lymphoma xenografts were transplanted in cyclophosphamide-pretreated athymic BALB/c mice . Four groups of mice were injected intravenously with (131)I- , (186)Re- , (88)Y- , or (177)Lu-labeled hLL2 , respectively . To determine the nonspecific tumor uptake , two groups of mice received (88)Y-labeled or (131)I-labeled control antibody , cG250 . The biodistribution of the radiolabel was determined 1 , 3 , and 7 days postinjection ( p.i. ) . RESULTS : Radiolabeled hLL2 had a higher tumor uptake than the nonspecific mAb at all time-points , irrespective of the radiolabel used . Tumor accretion of (88)Y- and (177)Lu-hLL2 was higher than tumor uptake of (131)I- and (186)Re-hLL2 . Activity in the bone , represented by the femur without bone marrow , was higher for (177)Lu- and (88)Y-hLL2 than for (131)I- and (186)Re-hLL2 on day 7 p.i . CONCLUSION : The use of the residualizing radiolabels (88)Y and (177)Lu in combination with a mAb directed against an internalizing antigen resulted in higher uptake and better retention of the radiolabel in the tumor .
