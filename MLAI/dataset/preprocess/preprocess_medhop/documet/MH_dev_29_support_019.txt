Protease-resistant human Q99259 -derived altered peptide ligands decrease P01375 and Q16552 production in peripheral blood cells from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus . DB00142 decarboxylase 65 ( Q99259 ) and proinsulin are major diabetes-associated autoantigens that drive autoreactive T cells . Altered peptide ligands ( APL ) have been proposed as reagents for the modification of autoimmune reactions . Here , we have prepared Q99259 -derived protease-resistant APL ( prAPL ) by cleavage site-directed modification . The resulting prAPL are resistant to lysosomal and serum proteases , bind with high-affinity to HLA- Q8IUH3 (*)0401 and have a prolonged half-life in the serum . Q99259 -derived prAPL significantly decreased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by a Q99259 -specific human T cell clone . Likewise , the production of Q16552 , P01375 , and secretion of P05231 by peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) was reduced , when stimulated with both Q99259 and Q99259 -derived prAPL . Thus , prAPL with high affinity for HLA- Q8IUH3 (*)0401 mitigate the response of Q99259 -reactive human Th17 cells . The strategy of designing specific immunomodulatory protease-resistant altered peptide ligands provides the basis for novel avenues of therapeutic intervention .
