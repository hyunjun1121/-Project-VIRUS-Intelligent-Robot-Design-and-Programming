Nodes and biological processes identified on the basis of network analysis in the brain of the senescence accelerated mice as an Alzheimer 's disease animal model . Harboring the behavioral and histopathological signatures of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , senescence accelerated mouse-prone 8 ( SAMP8 ) mice are currently considered a robust model for studying AD . However , the underlying mechanisms , prioritized pathways and genes in SAMP8 mice linked to AD remain unclear . In this study , we provide a biological interpretation of the molecular underpinnings of SAMP8 mice . Our results were derived from differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice compared to age-matched SAMR1 mice at 2 , 6 , and 12 months of age using cDNA microarray analysis . On the basis of PPI , MetaCore and the co-expression network , we constructed a distinct genetic sub-network in the brains of SAMP8 mice . Next , we determined that the regulation of synaptic transmission and apoptosis were disrupted in the brains of SAMP8 mice . We found abnormal gene expression of P04049 , P10636 , P35354 , CDKN2A , Q9UQM7 , Q16620 , Q15109 , P25098 , O60318 , and Q9UNE7 , which may have initiated the dysfunction of biological processes in the brains of SAMP8 mice . Specifically , we found microRNAs , including miR-20a , miR-17 , miR-34a , miR-155 , miR-18a , miR-22 , miR-26a , miR-101 , miR-106b , and miR-125b , that might regulate the expression of nodes in the sub-network . Taken together , these results provide new insights into the biological and genetic mechanisms of SAMP8 mice and add an important dimension to our understanding of the neuro-pathogenesis in SAMP8 mice from a systems perspective .
