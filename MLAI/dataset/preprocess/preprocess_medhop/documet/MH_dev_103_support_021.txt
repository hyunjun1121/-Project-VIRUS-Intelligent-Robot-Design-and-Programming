The contribution of serotonin P28335 and melanocortin-4 receptors to the satiety signaling of glucagon-like peptide 1 and liraglutide , a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist , in mice . Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P0C6A0 ) , an insulinotropic gastrointestinal peptide produced mainly from intestinal endocrine L-cells , and liraglutide , a P43220 ( P43220 ) agonist , induce satiety . The serotonin P28335 receptor ( 5-HT2CR ) and melanoroctin-4 receptor ( P32245 ) are involved in the regulation of food intake . Here we show that systemic administration of P0C6A0 ( 50 and 200μg/kg ) -induced anorexia was blunted in mice with a 5HT2CR null mutation , and was attenuated in mice with a heterozygous P32245 mutation . On the other hand , systemic administration of liraglutide ( 50 and 100μg/kg ) suppressed food intake in mice lacking 5-HT2CR , mice with a heterozygous mutation of P32245 and wild-type mice matched for age . Moreover , once-daily consecutive intraperitoneal administration of liraglutide ( 100μg/kg ) over 3days significantly suppressed daily food intake and body weight in mice with a heterozygous mutation of P32245 as well as wild-type mice . These findings suggest that P0C6A0 and liraglutide induce anorexia via different central pathways .
