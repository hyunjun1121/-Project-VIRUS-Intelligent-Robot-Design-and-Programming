Q07869 gene variants influence progression of coronary atherosclerosis and risk of coronary artery disease . BACKGROUND : Q07869 ( PPARalpha ) regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation , making it a candidate gene for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : We investigated the association between the leucine 162 to valine ( L162V ) polymorphism and a G to C transversion in intron 7 of the PPARalpha gene and progression of atherosclerosis in the DB01241 Coronary Angiography Trial ( LOCAT ) , a trial examining the effect of gemfibrozil treatment on progression of atherosclerosis after bypass surgery and on risk of IHD in the second Northwick Park Heart Study ( Q9NP85 ) , a prospective study of healthy middle-aged men in the United Kingdom . There was no association with plasma lipid concentrations in either study . Both polymorphisms influenced progression of atherosclerosis and risk of IHD . V162 allele carriers had less progression of diffuse atherosclerosis than did L162 allele homozygotes with a similar trend for focal atherosclerosis . Intron 7 C allele carriers had greater progression of atherosclerosis than did G allele homozygotes . The V162 allele attenuated the proatherosclerotic effect of the intron 7 C allele . Homozygotes for the intron 7 C allele had increased risk of IHD , an effect modulated by the L162V polymorphism CONCLUSIONS : The PPARalpha gene affects progression of atherosclerosis and risk of IHD . Absence of association with plasma lipid concentrations suggests that PPARalpha affects atherosclerotic progression directly in the vessel wall .
