Design and synthesis of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles as potent inhibitors of phosphodiesterase4b2 . A series of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles has been prepared and evaluated for phosphodiesterase inhibition ( PDE4B2 ) . Among the prepared 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles , compound 9a is the most potent inhibitor ( PDE4B2 IC(50) = 5.28 Î¼m ) . Structure-activity relationship studies of 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles revealed that substituents 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl group at 3-position and cyclic ring bearing heteroatoms at 5-position are important for activity . Molecular modeling study of the 3,5-disubstituted-1,2,4-oxadiazoles with Q07343 has shown similar interactions of 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl group ; however , heteroatom ring is slightly deviating when compared to DB01791 . 3-(3-Cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole ( 9a ) exhibited good analgesic and antiinflammatory activities in formalin-induced pain in mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rat .
