Targeting tumorigenesis : development and use of P42345 inhibitors in cancer therapy . The mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) is an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase positioned at a central point in a variety of cellular signaling cascades . The established involvement of P42345 activity in the cellular processes that contribute to the development and progression of cancer has identified P42345 as a major link in tumorigenesis . Consequently , inhibitors of P42345 , including temsirolimus , everolimus , and ridaforolimus ( formerly deforolimus ) have been developed and assessed for their safety and efficacy in patients with cancer . DB06287 is an intravenously administered agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . DB01590 is an oral agent that has recently obtained US FDA and EMEA approval for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib . Ridaforolimus is not yet approved for any indication . The use of P42345 inhibitors , either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents , has the potential to provide anticancer activity in numerous tumor types . Cancer types in which these agents are under evaluation include neuroendocrine tumors , breast cancer , leukemia , lymphoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , gastric cancer , pancreatic cancer , sarcoma , endometrial cancer , and non-small-cell lung cancer . The results of ongoing clinical trials with P42345 inhibitors , as single agents and in combination regimens , will better define their activity in cancer .
