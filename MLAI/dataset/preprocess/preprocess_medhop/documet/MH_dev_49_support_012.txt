Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls DB01367 oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic . Inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , a human carcinogen , potentially targets the prostate . iAs malignantly transforms the RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial line to CAsE-PE cells , and a derivative normal stem cell ( SC ) line , WPE-stem , to As-Cancer SC ( As-CSC ) line . MicroRNAs ( miRNA ) are noncoding but exert negative control on expression by degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs . Aberrant miRNA expression is important in carcinogenesis . A miRNA array of CAsE-PE and As-CSC revealed common altered expression in both for pathways concerning oncogenesis , miRNA biogenesis , cell signaling , proliferation , and tumor metastasis and invasion . The P01116 oncogene is overexpressed in CAsE-PE cells but not by mutation or promoter hypomethylation , and is intensely overexpressed in As-CSC cells . In both transformants , decreased miRNAs targeting P01116 and DB01367 superfamily members occurred . Reduced miR-134 , miR-373 , miR-155 , miR-138 , miR-205 , miR-181d , miR-181c , and let-7 in CAsE-PE cells correlated with increased target DB01367 oncogenes , RAN , P51159 , Q9UL26 mRNAs , and P01116 protein . Reduced miR-143 , miR-34c-5p , and miR-205 in As-CSC correlated with increased target RAN mRNA , and P01116 , P01111 , and P10301 proteins . The DB01367 / P29323 and PI3K/ P60484 /AKT pathways control cell survival , differentiation , and proliferation , and when dysregulated promote a cancer phenotype . iAs transformation increased expression of activated P29323 kinase in both transformants and altered components of the PI3K/ P60484 /AKT pathway including decreased P60484 and increases in P10415 , BCL-XL , and P15692 in the absence of AKT activation . Thus , dysregulated miRNA expression may be linked to DB01367 activation in both transformants .
