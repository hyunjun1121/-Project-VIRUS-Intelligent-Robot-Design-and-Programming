Q9Y5Y4 is the most reliable marker for the detection of circulating human type 2 Th and type 2 T cytotoxic cells in health and disease . Cells expressing the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells ( Q9Y5Y4 ) and the chemokine C receptor (CCR)4 were consistently detected in the circulation of healthy subjects , whereas numbers of cells expressing P51677 were much lower . While all CCR4+ cells were T cells , a small proportion of Q9Y5Y4 + , and about a half of the few P51677 + cells were basophils . Only Q9Y5Y4 + T cells contained Th2 or Tc2 cells , but neither Th0 or Tc0 , nor Th1 or Tc1 cells , although not all of them produced Th2-type cytokines . By contrast , CCR4+ T cells contained both Th2 or Tc2 and Th0 or Tc0 cells and even Th1 or Tc1 cells , whereas the few P51677 + T cells were not clearly classifiable for their cytokine profile . Q9Y5Y4 + T lymphocytes were virtually devoid of chemokine CX receptor (CXCR)3+ and P51681 + cells , but enriched in P51677 + and CCR4+ cells . By contrast , P51677 + or CCR4+ T cells did not show a similar clear-cut dichotomy in the expression of P51681 / P49682 or P51677 / CCR4 . Subjects with atopic dermatitis or HIV infection with low levels of circulating P01730 + T cells revealed a significant increase of Q9Y5Y4 + cells within both the P01730 + and the CD8+ T cell subset . These data support the concept that at present Q9Y5Y4 is the more reliable marker for detection of both human Th2 and Tc2 cells in health and disease .
