[ Recent advances in the study of AMPK and inflammatory pulmonary disease ] . AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is an important regulator of cellular energy homeostasis . Recent studies demonstrated that AMPK is a novel signaling molecule modulating inflammatory responses and oxidative stress which are involved in inflammatory pulmonary diseases , such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , pulmonary infectious diseases and pulmonary fibrosis . AMPK attenuates inflammatory lung injury by phosphorylating its downstream targets , such as sirtuin1 ( Q96EB6 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha ( P20142 -1alpha ) , p53 and forkhead box O3a ( FoxO3a ) . This review summarized the relationship between AMPK and the development of inflammatory pulmonary diseases .
