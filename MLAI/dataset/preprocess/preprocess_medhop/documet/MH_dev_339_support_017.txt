Measuring ligand-dependent and ligand-independent interactions between nuclear receptors and associated proteins using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer ( BRET ) . Bioluminescent resonance energy transfer ( BRET2 ) is a recently developed technology for the measurement of protein-protein interactions in a live , cell-based system . BRET2 is characterized by the efficient transfer of excited energy between a bioluminescent donor molecule ( Renilla luciferase ) and a fluorescent acceptor molecule ( a mutant of Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP2 ) . The BRET2 assay offers advantages over fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) because it does not require an external light source thereby eliminating problems of photobleaching and autoflourescence . The absence of contamination by light results in low background that permits detection of very small changes in the BRET2 signal . BRET2 is dependent on the orientation and distance between two fusion proteins and therefore requires extensive preliminary standardization experiments to conclude a positive BRET2 signal independent of variations in protein titrations and arrangement in tertiary structures . P03372 ( ER ) signaling is modulated by steroid receptor coactivator 1 ( Q15788 ) . To establish BRET2 in a ligand inducible system we used Q15788 as the donor moiety and ER as the acceptor moiety . Expression and functionality of the fusion proteins were assessed by transient transfection in P29320 -293 cells followed by Western blot analysis and measurement of ER-dependent reporter gene activity . These preliminary determinations are required prior to measuring nuclear receptor protein-protein interactions by BRET2 . This article describes in detail the BRET2 methodology for measuring interaction between full-length ER and coregulator proteins in real-time , in an in vivo environment .
