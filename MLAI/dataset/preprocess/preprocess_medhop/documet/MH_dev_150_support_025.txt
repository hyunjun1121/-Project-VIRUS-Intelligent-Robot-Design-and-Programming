P10275 in human skin cytosol . Human skin , an accessible tissue , is an androgen target organ . We have measured the androgen-binding capacity of human skin cytosol using either 5 alpha[3H]dihydrotestosterone ( [3H] DB02901 ) or [3H]methyltrienolone ( [3H]R-1881 ) as ligand . Samples were incubated for 20 h at 0 C , and dextran-coated charcoal was used to separate bound from free steroids . The androgen receptor has a high affinity for both ligands ( 0.23 +/- 0.04 nM for [3H] DB02901 ; 0.32 +/- 0.16 nM for [3H]R-1881 ) . DB00624 , cyproterone acetate , and , to a lesser extent , estradiol also bind this protein . Progesterone displaces R-1881 from its binding sites , whereas its 5 alpha-reduced metabolite somewhat inhibits DB02901 binding . The highest binding capacity is measured in cytosol of skin from external genitalia ( 129.14 +/- 58.0 fmol/g skin ; n = 34 ) ; it is lower in pubic skin ( 21.8 +/- 13 fmol/g skin ; n = 6 ) . There is no variation as a function of age or sex in genital skin ; the higher concentrations observed in the cytosol of pubic skin of women compared to that of men are probably related to lower levels of endogenous steroids . Whereas most patients with the complete form of the testicular feminization syndrome do not have detectable concentrations of androgen receptor , one patient with apparent complete clinical androgen insensitivity had a normal androgen-binding capacity . The parity of values in genital skin from men and women , the absence of variation with age , and the presence of a cytosolic androgen receptor in some androgen-insensitive patients suggest that the androgen receptor in human skin cytosol is not regulated by androgens .
