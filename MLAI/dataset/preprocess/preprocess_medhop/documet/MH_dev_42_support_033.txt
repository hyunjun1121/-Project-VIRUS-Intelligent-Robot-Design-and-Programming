Regulation of gene expression in melanoma : new approaches for treatment . The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase ( RGP ) to vertical growth phase ( VGP , metastatic phenotype ) are not yet well defined . We have demonstrated that the progression of human melanoma is associated with loss of expression of the transcription factor P05549 . In metastatic melanoma cells , this loss resulted in overexpression of P43121 / P43121 , P08253 , the thrombin receptor ( P25116 ) , and lack of c- P10721 expression . The transition from RGP to VGP is also associated with overexpression of the angiogenic factor P10145 . Additionally , the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is associated with overexpression of the transcription factors CREB and P39905 -1 , both of which may act as survival factors for human melanoma cells . Inactivation of CREB/ P39905 -1 activities in metastatic melanoma cells by dominant-negative CREB or by anti- P39905 -1 single chain antibody fragment ( ScFv ) , resulted in deregulation of P08253 and P43121 / P43121 , increased the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis , and inhibition of their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in vivo . In this prospect article , we summarize our data on the role of P05549 and CREB/ P39905 -1 in the progression of human melanoma and report on the development of new fully human antibodies anti- P43121 / P43121 and anti- P10145 which could serve as new modalities for the treatment of melanoma .
