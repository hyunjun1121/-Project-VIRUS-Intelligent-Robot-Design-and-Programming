DB00877 induces the TGFbeta1/Smad signaling cascade in renal mesangial cells upstream of P42345 . The P42345 kinase inhibitor rapamycin ( sirolimus ) is a drug with potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties . We found that rapamycin induces the TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade in rat mesangial cells ( MC ) as depicted by the nuclear translocation of phospho-Smads 2 , -3 and Smad-4 , respectively . Concomitantly , rapamycin increases the nuclear DNA binding of receptor ( R ) - and co-Smad proteins to a cognate Smad-binding element ( SBE ) which in turn causes an increase in profibrotic gene expression as exemplified by the connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( P05121 ) . Using small interfering (si)RNA we demonstrate that Smad 2/3 activation by rapamycin depends on its endogenous receptor FK binding protein 12 ( P62942 ) . Mechanistically , Smad induction by rapamycin is initiated by an increase in active TGFbeta(1) as shown by ELISA and by the inhibitory effects of a neutralizing TGFbeta antibody . Using an activin receptor-like kinase ( Q9UM73 ) -5 inhibitor and by siRNA against the TGFbeta type II receptor ( TGFbeta-RII ) we furthermore demonstrate a functional involvement of both types of TGFbeta receptors . However , rapamycin did not compete with TGFbeta for TGFbeta-receptor binding as found in radioligand-binding assay . Besides SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK , the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine ( Q9C000 ) and a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) mimetic strongly abrogated the stimulatory effects of rapamycin on Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation . Furthermore , the rapid increase in dichlorofluorescein ( DCF ) formation implies that rapamycin mainly acts through ROS . In conclusion , activation of the profibrotic TGFbeta/Smad signaling cascade accompanies the immunosuppressive and antiproliferative actions of rapamycin .
