The bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway is upregulated in a mouse model of total parenteral nutrition . Total parenteral nutrition ( O15533 ) results in intestinal mucosal atrophic changes due to an absence of enteral nutrition ; however , the mechanisms responsible for this are not fully understood . It has been shown that bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) activation inhibits intestinal epithelial cell ( EC ) proliferation . Therefore , we hypothesized that the BMP pathway could be upregulated by O15533 . To address this , we randomly assigned mice to receive O15533 or to be enterally fed ( control ) for 7 d . Mucosal EC isolates were harvested from the entire length of small intestine for RNA and protein measurements . Q8N1N2 -thickness , mid-small bowel was processed for histological examination . O15533 increased the abundance of P12643 , P12644 , and Q13873 at the RNA and protein levels . Phosphorylation of Q15797 , Q99717 , and Smad8 also was greater in the O15533 group than in the control , which helped to confirm activation of this pathway . Interestingly , the O15533 and control groups did not differ in the mRNA expression of the extracellular soluble bmp antagonists , noggin , gremlin , chordin , or follistatin . Compared to the control group , the expression of c-Myc ( cellular myelocytomatosis ) mRNA was lower , whereas the level of P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) was greater , in the O15533 group . Because the BMP family may function through suppression of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling , this pathway was also examined . mRNA expression of Wnt 3 , Wnt5a , and the Wnt receptor Lrp5 were lower in the O15533 group compared to controls . The results suggest that the BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the development of intestinal mucosal atrophy due to O15533 administration .
