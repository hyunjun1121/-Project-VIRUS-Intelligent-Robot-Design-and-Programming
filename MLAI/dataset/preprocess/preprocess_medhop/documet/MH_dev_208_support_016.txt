Improving development of cloned goat embryos by supplementing α-lipoic acid to oocyte in vitro maturation medium . α-Lipoic acid ( LA ) is a powerful antioxidant for clinical therapy of some metabolic diseases , but there are few reports about the effect of LA on animal occyte in vitro maturation ( IVM ) . The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of supplementing LA to IVM medium on subsequently developmental competence of goat cloning embryos after somatic cell nucleus transfer ( SCNT ) . Twenty-five micromolars LA significantly increased 12 % oocyte maturation rate from control 57.8 % to treated group 69.8 % ( P < 0.05 ) . The reconstructed rate of cloning embryos in LA supplement group ( 67.3 % ) was significantly higher than control ( 56.5 % , P < 0.05 ) . Although the SCNT embryo cleavage rates did not have significant difference between the two groups ( 42.0 % vs. 47.9 % , P > 0.05 ) , LA supplement group had significantly higher blastocyst formation rate and hatched rate than control ( 24.0 % vs. 18.4 % and 37.0 % vs. 30.9 % , respectively , P < 0.05 ) . In addition , supplementing LA significantly reduced the cellular apoptosis rate of nucleus transfer blastocysts by inhibiting the expression of apoptotic activators , such as Bax , Bad , P42574 , and CytC genes and promoting cumulus-oocyte complexes to synthesize glutathione ( DB00143 ) and express antioxidant enzymes such as P36969 and SOD genes . In conclusion , supplement of LA to oocyte IVM medium could improve the maturation rate and antioxidant ability of oocytes and increase the developmental competence of oocytes after SCNT .
