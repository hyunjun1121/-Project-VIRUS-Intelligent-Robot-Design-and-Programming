P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) and urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) in sputum of allergic asthma patients . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its inhibitor ( P05121 ) have been associated with asthma . The aim of this study was to evaluate concentration of uPA and P05121 in induced sputum of house dust mite allergic asthmatics ( HDM-AAs ) . The study was performed on 19 HDM-AAs and 8 healthy nonatopic controls ( HCs ) . Concentration of uPA and P05121 was evaluated in induced sputum supernatants using ELISA method . In HDM-AAs the median sputum concentration of uPA ( 128 pg/ml ; 95 % CI 99 to 183 pg/ml ) and P05121 ( 4063 pg/ml ; 95 % CI 3319 to 4784 pg/ml ) were significantly greater than in HCs ( 17 pg/ml ; 95 % CI 12 to 32 pg/ml ; p < 0.001 and 626 pg/ml ; 95 % CI 357 to 961 pg/ml ; p < 0.001 for uPA and P05121 respectively ) . The sputum concentration of uPA correlated with sputum total cell count ( r=0.781 ; p=0.0001 ) and with logarithmically transformed exhaled nitric oxide concentration ( eNO ) ( r=0.486 ; p=0.035 ) but not with FEV1 or bronchial reactivity to histamine . On the contrary , the sputum P05121 concentration correlated with FEV1 ( r=-0,718 ; p=0.0005 ) and bronchial reactivity to histamine expressed as log(PC20) ( r=-0.824 ; p < 0.0001 ) but did not correlate with sputum total cell count or eNO . The results of this study support previous observations linking P05121 with airway remodeling and uPA with cellular inflammation . Moreover , the observed effect of uPA seems to be independent of its fibrynolytic activity .
