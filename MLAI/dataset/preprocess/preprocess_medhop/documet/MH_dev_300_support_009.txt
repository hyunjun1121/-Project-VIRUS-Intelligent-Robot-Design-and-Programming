Anticancer drug discovery targeting DNA hypermethylation . DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) are important regulators of gene transcription and their roles in carcinogenesis have been a topic of considerable interest in the last few years . Diverse classes of chemical compounds including nucleotide analogues , adenosine analogues , aminobenzoic derivatives , polyphenols , hydrazines , phthalides , disulfides and antisenses are being discovered and evaluated as P26358 inhibitors targeting DNA hypermethylation . Among them , DB00928 5 and Decitabine 6 were launched recently . Several other compounds are under clinical trials . Some of these compounds were discovered from structure-based drug design . These compounds exert their DNA methylation inhibitory by different mechanisms . This review will present a brief account of various DNA methyltransferases and their biological functions , with focus on actuality of design and synthesis of various inhibitors of DNA hypermethylation as anticancer drugs .
