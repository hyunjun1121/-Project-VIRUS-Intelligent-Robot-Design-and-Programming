DB00898 dose-dependently elicits opposing regulatory effects on hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunits through a zeta inhibitory peptide-sensitive kinase in adolescent and adult Sprague-Dawley rats . AMPA receptor P42262 subunits are strongly implicated in cognition , and prior work suggests that these subunits may be regulated by atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) isoforms . The present study assessed whether hippocampal and cortical AMPA receptor P42262 subunit regulation may be an underlying factor in known age-related differences to cognitive-impairing doses of ethanol , and if aPKC isoforms modulate such responses . Hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunit , protein kinase Mζ ( PKMζ ) , and PKCι/λ expression were elevated during adolescence compared to adults . 1 h following a low-dose ( 1.0-g/kg ) ethanol exposure , hippocampal AMPA receptor P42262 subunit serine 880 phosphorylation was decreased in adolescents , but was increased in adults . Age-dependent changes in P42262 subunit phosphorylation were paralleled by alterations in aPKC isoforms , and zeta inhibitory peptide ( Q8N5A5 ) administration prevented ethanol-induced increases in both in adults . DB00898 -induced changes in P42262 subunit phosphorylation were associated with delayed regulation in synaptosomal P42262 subunit expression 24 h later . A higher ethanol dose ( 3.5-g/kg ) failed to elicit changes in most measures in the hippocampus at either age . Similar to the hippocampus , analysis of cerebral cortical tissue also revealed age-related declines . However , no demonstrable effects were found following a low-dose ethanol exposure at either age . High-dose ethanol exposure reduced adolescent P42262 subunit phosphorylation and aPKC isoform expression that were again accompanied by delayed reductions in synaptosomal P42262 subunit expression . Together , these results suggest that P42262 -containing AMPA receptor modulation by aPKC isoforms is age- , region- and dose-dependently regulated , and may potentially be involved in developmentally regulated ethanol-induced cognitive impairment and other ethanol behaviors .
