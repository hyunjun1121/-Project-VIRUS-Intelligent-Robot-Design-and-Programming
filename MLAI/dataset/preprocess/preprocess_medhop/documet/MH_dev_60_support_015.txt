Is Q13304 a P2Y/leukotriene receptor ? examination of uracil nucleotides , nucleotide sugars , and cysteinyl leukotrienes as agonists of Q13304 . The orphan receptor Q13304 has been reported to be activated by UDP , UDP-sugars , and cysteinyl leukotrienes , and coupled to intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and inhibition of DB02527 accumulation , but other studies have reported either a different agonist profile or lack of agonist activity altogether . To determine if Q13304 is activated by uracil nucleotides and leukotrienes , the hemagglutinin-tagged receptor was expressed in five different cell lines and the signaling properties of the receptor were investigated . In P13671 , 1321N1 , or Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells stably expressing Q13304 , UDP , UDP-glucose , DB03501 , and cysteinyl leukotriene C4 ( LTC4 ) all failed to promote inhibition of forskolin-stimulated DB02527 accumulation , whereas both UDP and UDP-glucose promoted marked inhibition ( > 80 % ) of forskolin-stimulated DB02527 accumulation in P13671 and CHO cells expressing the Q15391 receptor . Likewise , none of these compounds promoted accumulation of inositol phosphates in COS-7 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with Q13304 alone or cotransfected with Gαq/i5 , which links Gi-coupled receptors to the Gq-regulated phospholipase C ( P98160 ) signaling pathway , or PLCε , which is activated by the Gα12/13 signaling pathway . Moreover , none of these compounds promoted internalization of Q13304 in 1321N1- Q13304 cells . Consistent with previous reports , coexpression experiments of Q13304 with cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 ( Q9Y271 ) suggested that Q13304 acts as a negative regulator of Q9Y271 . Taken together , these data suggest that UDP , UDP-glucose , DB03501 , and LTC4 are not the cognate ligands of Q13304 .
