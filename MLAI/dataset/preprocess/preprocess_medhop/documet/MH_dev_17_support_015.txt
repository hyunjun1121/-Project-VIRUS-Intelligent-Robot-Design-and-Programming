Effect of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of glimepiride in a Korean population . BACKGROUNDS : DB00222 is a commonly used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent . There is considerable interindividual variation in the response to sulfonylurea for patients with type 2 diabetes . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations influence the efficacy of glimepiride in healthy Korean subjects . METHODS : A single 2-mg oral dose of glimepiride was administered to 46 healthy volunteers . Serial blood sampling for 12h after oral dosing was performed for determination of plasma glimepiride , glucose and insulin levels . We tested the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in four candidate genes with the efficacy of glimepiride . RESULTS : Pharmacodynamic profiles for plasma glucose and insulin showed no statistically significant differences among genotype groups , and parameters were not different from one another . There were no association of the Q14654 , O75052 , Q9NQB0 and Q09428 gene polymorphisms and the efficacy of glimepiride . CONCLUSIONS : Knowledge of these polymorphisms provides no clinical useful information for the pharmacogenetic therapeutic approach for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes .
