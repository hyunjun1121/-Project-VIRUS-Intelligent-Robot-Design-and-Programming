DB00945 and age-related macular degeneration : positives versus negatives . The anti-inflammatory , analgesic , antipyretic and antithrombotic activities of aspirin confer its wide therapeutic application . The three former activities require higher doses of aspirin , whereas the latter can be achieved through a lower , thus safer dose of the drug . Low-dose , long-term aspirin is used as an antithrombotic therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease . Such therapy is used by millions of people worldwide , including those suffering from age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) ; thus , questions have arisen as to whether such treatment has any impact on the development and course of AMD . This editorial addresses the important issue of possible beneficial and adverse effects of long-term , low-dose aspirin treatment of AMD patients . Special emphasis is given to the ability of aspirin to acetylate cyclooxygenases ( especially P35354 ) and thus to initiate a biochemical pathway leading to the generation of anti-inflammatory pro-resolving mediators synthesized from both ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids . Such mediators ( e.g. , resolvins , lipoxins ) may be of therapeutic value in retarding the development of dry form AMD .
