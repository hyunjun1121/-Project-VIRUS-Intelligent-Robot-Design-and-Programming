Blood coagulation factors changes during liver regeneration in rats . Effects of partial hepatectomy on blood coagulation factors were investigated in rats . Analysis were performed 24 , 48 and 72 hours after surgery . Howell 's time was significantly higher after 24 and 48 h compared to the control value . P00734 time was significantly prolonged after 24 h . Partial thromboplastin time did not differ significantly in any time . FII values were significantly reduced after 24 and 48 h , but FV values only after 24 h . FVII showed significant decrease after 24 h , but significant increase at 48 h . FVIII and P01008 average values were significantly lower after 24 , 48 and 72 h . Plasma fibrinogen increased . Significant differences were observed 48 and 72 h after surgery . Differences in normalization time of these coagulation factors are most probably the consequence of their synthesis in various cell types , regenerated at different periods after partial hepatectomy .
