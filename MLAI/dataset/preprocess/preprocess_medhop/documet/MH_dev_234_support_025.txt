Inhibition of SKF 38393- and pergolide-induced circling in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesion is correlated to dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor affinities in vitro . The effects of 30 dopamine ( DA ) antagonists , including 4 as stereoisomeric pairs , on circling behaviour induced by the D-1 agonist SKF 38393 and the D-2 agonist pergolide in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxy-DA lesions have been studied . SKF 38393-induced circling was selectively blocked by the specific D-1 antagonists P35240 23390 and SKF 83566 , and was furthermore blocked by other DA antagonists with potencies correlating to their affinities to D-1 receptors labelled by 3H- P35240 23390 in vitro . DB01186 -antagonistic potencies in contrast correlated to affinities to D-2 receptors labelled by 3H-spiperone in vitro . DB01186 -induced circling was selectively blocked by the specific D-2 antagonists in the benzamide series . No interaction between D-1 and D-2 antagonists was observed in combination experiments with P35240 23390 and YM 09151-2 in both circling models . Among other reference neurotransmitter antagonists acting on alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors , histamine , serotonin and muscarinic receptors , only the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was effective in high doses . In contrast , the alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and clenbuterol as well as the muscarinic agonist RS 86 inhibited circling induced by SKF 38393 as well as pergolide . The P08908 agonist 8-OHDPAT inhibited pergolide-induced circling only . It is concluded that these two behavioural models are selective in vivo measures of relative D-1 and D-2 receptor activity of DA antagonists .
