Nicotinic alpha 7 receptors as a new target for treatment of cannabis abuse . Increasing use of cannabis makes the search for medications to reduce cannabis abuse extremely important . Here , we show that homomeric alpha7 nicotinic receptors are novel molecular entities that could be targeted in the development of new drugs for the treatment of cannabis dependence . In rats , systemic administration of the selective alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine ( MLA ) , but not the selective heteromeric non-alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist dihydrobetaerythroidine , ( 1 ) antagonized the discriminative effects of DB00470 ( THC ) , the main active ingredient in cannabis , ( 2 ) reduced intravenous self-administration of the synthetic cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 [ ( R ) -(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone , mesylate salt ] , and ( 3 ) decreased THC-induced dopamine elevations in the shell of the nucleus accumbens . Altogether , our results indicate that blockade of alpha7 nicotinic receptors reverses abuse-related behavioral and neurochemical effects of cannabinoids . Importantly , MLA reversed the effects of cannabinoids at doses that did not produce depressant or toxic effects , further pointing to alpha7 nicotinic antagonists as potentially useful agents in the treatment of cannabis abuse in humans .
