Neuromuscular therapeutics by RNA-targeted suppression of P22303 gene expression . RNA-targeted therapeutics offers inherent advantages over small molecule drugs wherever one out of several splice variant enzymes should be inhibited . Here , we report the use of Monarsen , a 20-mer acetylcholinesterase-targeted antisense agent with three 3'-2'o-methyl-protected nucleotides , for selectively attenuating the stress-induced accumulation of the normally rare , soluble " readthrough " acetylcholinesterase variant P22303 -R . DB03128 hydrolysis by P22303 -R may cause muscle fatigue and moreover , limit the cholinergic anti-inflammatory blockade , yielding inflammation-associated pathology . Specific P22303 -R targeting by Monarsen was achieved in cultured cells , experimental animals , and patient volunteers . In rats with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis , oral delivery of Monarsen improved muscle action potential in a lower dose regimen ( nanomolar versus micromolar ) , rapid and prolonged manner ( up to 72 h versus 2-4 h ) as compared with the currently used small molecule anticholinesterases . In central nervous system neurons of both rats and cynomolgus monkeys , systematic Monarsen treatment further suppressed the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and P05231 . Toxicology testing and ongoing clinical trials support the notion that Monarsen treatment would offer considerable advantages over conventional cholinesterase inhibitors with respect to dosing , specificity , side effects profile , and duration of efficacy , while raising some open questions regarding its detailed mechanism of action .
