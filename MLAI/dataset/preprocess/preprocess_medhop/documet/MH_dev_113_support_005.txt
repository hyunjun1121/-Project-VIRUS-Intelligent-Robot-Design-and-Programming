P42892 and β-arrestins exert spatiotemporal control of DB05875 -induced inflammatory signals . Although the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors controls specific signaling events , it is unclear how the spatiotemporal control of signaling contributes to complex pathophysiological processes such as inflammation . By using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and superresolution microscopy , we found that DB05875 ( SP ) induces the association of the neurokinin 1 receptor ( P25103 ) with two classes of proteins that regulate SP signaling from plasma and endosomal membranes : the scaffolding proteins β-arrestin ( βARRs ) 1 and 2 and the transmembrane metallopeptidases ECE-1c and ECE-1d . In HEK293 cells and non-transformed human colonocytes , we observed that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and β P49407 /2 terminate plasma membrane Ca(2+) signaling and initiate receptor trafficking to endosomes that is necessary for sustained activation of ERKs in the nucleus . βARRs deliver the SP- P25103 endosomes , where P42892 associates with the complex , degrades SP , and allows the P25103 , freed from βARRs , to recycle . Thus , both P42892 and βARRs mediate the resensitization of P25103 Ca(2+) signaling at the plasma membrane . Sustained exposure of colonocytes to SP activates NF-κB and stimulates P10145 secretion . This proinflammatory signaling is unaffected by inhibition of the endosomal P29323 pathway but is suppressed by P42892 inhibition or β P32121 knockdown . Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A , which also contributes to sustained P25103 signaling at the plasma membrane , similarly attenuates P10145 secretion . Thus , the primary function of βARRs and P42892 in SP-dependent inflammatory signaling is to promote resensitization , which allows the sustained P25103 signaling from the plasma membrane that drives inflammation .
