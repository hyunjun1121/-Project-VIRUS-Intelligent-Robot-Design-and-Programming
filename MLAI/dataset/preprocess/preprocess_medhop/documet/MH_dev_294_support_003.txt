Serotonergic stimulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone and pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression . The neurotransmitter serotonin ( 5-HT ) stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) secretion from the anterior pituitary gland via activation of central 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors . The effect of 5-HT is predominantly indirect and may be mediated via release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) . We therefore investigated the possible involvement of P06850 in the serotonergic stimulation of DB01285 secretion in male rats . Increased neuronal 5-HT content induced by systemic administration of the precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) in combination with the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine raised P06850 mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) by 64 % , increased pro-opiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) mRNA in the anterior pituitary lobe by 17 % and stimulated DB01285 secretion five-fold . Central administration of 5-HT agonists specific to P08908 , P28222 , 5- Q13049 or P28335 receptors increased P06850 mRNA in the PVN by 15-50 % , P01189 mRNA in the anterior pituitary by 15-27 % and DB01285 secretion three- to five-fold , whereas a specific 5- Q9H205 agonist had no effect . Systemic administration of a specific anti- P06850 antiserum inhibited the DB01285 response to 5-HTP and fluoxetine and prevented the 5-HTP and fluoxetine-induced P01189 mRNA response in the anterior pituitary lobe . Central or systemic infusion of 5-HT increased DB01285 secretion seven- and eight-fold , respectively . Systemic pretreatment with the anti- P06850 antiserum reduced the DB01285 responses to 5-HT by 80 % and 64 % , respectively . It is concluded that 5-HT via activation of P08908 , 5- Q13049 , P28335 and possibly also P28222 receptors increases the synthesis of P06850 in the PVN and P01189 in the anterior pituitary lobe , which results in increased DB01285 secretion . Furthermore , the results indicate that P06850 is an important mediator of the DB01285 response to 5-HT .
