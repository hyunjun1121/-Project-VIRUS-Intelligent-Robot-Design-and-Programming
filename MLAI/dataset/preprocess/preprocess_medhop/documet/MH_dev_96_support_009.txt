Anti-inflammatory activity of Taraxacum officinale . Taraxacum officinale has been widely used as a folkloric medicine for the treatment of diverse diseases . The dried plant was extracted with 70 % ethanol to generate its ethanol extract ( TEE ) . For some experiments , ethyl acetate ( EA ) , n-butanol ( BuOH ) and aqueous ( Aq ) fractions were prepared in succession from TEE . TEE showed a scavenging activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) assay , a diminishing effect on intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) level , and an anti-angiogenic activity in the chicken chorioallantoic ( P62158 ) assay . In the carrageenan-induced air pouch model , TEE inhibited production of exudate , and significantly diminished nitric oxide ( NO ) and leukocyte levels in the exudate . It also possessed an inhibitory effect on acetic acid-induced vascular permeability and caused a dose-dependent inhibition on acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing in mice . Suppressive effects of TEE on the production of NO and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated macrophages were also assessed . Among the fractions , the n-butanol fraction ( BuOH ) was identified to be most effective in the P62158 assay . Collectively , Taraxacum officinale contains anti-angiogenic , anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities through its inhibition of NO production and P35354 expression and/or its antioxidative activity .
