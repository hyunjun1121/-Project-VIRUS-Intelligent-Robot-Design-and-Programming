DB00819 inhibits stimulated feline liver and gallbladder bicarbonate secretion . Bile acidification is a key factor in preventing calcium carbonate precipitation and gallstone formation . P00918 ( CA II ) , that is inhibited by acetazolamide , plays a role in regulation of the acid-base balance in many tissues . This study examines the effect of acetazolamide on secretin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) -stimulated gallbladder mucosal bicarbonate and acid secretion . Gallbladders in anaesthetized cats were perfused with a bicarbonate buffer bubbled with CO2 in air . In 20 experiments P01282 ( 10 microg kg(-1) h(-1) ) and in 10 experiments secretin ( 4 microg kg(-1) h(-1) ) were infused continuously intravenous ( i.v. ) . Hepatic bile and samples from the buffer before and after perfusion of the gallbladder were collected for calculation of ion and fluid transport . During basal conditions a continuous secretion of H+ by the gallbladder mucosa was seen . Intravenous infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) and secretin caused a secretion of bicarbonate from the gallbladder mucosa ( P < 0.01 ) . This secretion was reduced by intraluminal ( i.l. ) acetazolamide ( P < 0.01 ) . Bile flow was enhanced by infusion of P01282 and secretin ( P < 0.01 ) but this stimulated outflow was not affected by i.v. acetazolamide . The presence of CA II in the gallbladder was demonstrated by immunoblotting . Biliary CA activity has an important function in the regulation of P01282 - and secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion across the gallbladder mucosa .
