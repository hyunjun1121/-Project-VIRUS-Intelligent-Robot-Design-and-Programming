The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in cultured endothelial cells . P00749 ( uPA ) binds to cells via a specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor . Although occupancy of the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) has been shown to alter cellular function and to induce gene expression , the signaling mechanism has not been characterized . DB00013 induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in bovine aortic endothelial cells . In contrast , low molecular weight uPA did not induce this response . Analysis by immunoblotting demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) , the focal adhesion-associated proteins paxillin and Q08999 (cas) , and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) following the occupancy of the Q03405 by uPA . Treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C , which cleaves glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins from the cell surface , blocked the uPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Q05397 , indicating the requirement of an intact Q03405 on the cell surface . The uPA-induced activation of MAPK was completely inhibited by genistein , but not by 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo [ 3 , 4-d ] pyrimidine , a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases . Thus , this study demonstrates a novel role for the Q03405 in endothelial cell signal transduction that involves the activation of Q05397 and MAPK , which are mediated by the receptor-binding domain of uPA . This may have important implications for the mechanism through which uPA influences cell migration and differentiation .
