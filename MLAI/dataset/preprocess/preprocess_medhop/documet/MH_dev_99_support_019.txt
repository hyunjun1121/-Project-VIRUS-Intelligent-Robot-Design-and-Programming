[ Influence of insulin on human leukemia cell proliferation ] . As a hormone with a number of biological effects , insulin not only displays the function of classic metabolic regulation , but also can regulate cell proliferation and differentiation , and ensure growth and development of embryos and young individuals . In vitro insulin can stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation . P01308 is also an important growth regulator in vivo , which has been proved in more and more studies . The role of insulin at the cellular level is triggered by the binding of insulin to its receptor located in the cell surface . However , insulin at the higher concentration can also been triggered by insulin-like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) receptor . Its role varies in different cell lines . P06213 and insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 are widely expressed in human P43034 and AML cell membranes . Recently , many studies related to the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and cancer have been reported . In this review the role and its possible mechanism in promoting human leukemia cell proliferation and inhibiting human leukemia cell proliferation are summarized . Furthermore , the potential application prospect of insulin analogues also will be described .
