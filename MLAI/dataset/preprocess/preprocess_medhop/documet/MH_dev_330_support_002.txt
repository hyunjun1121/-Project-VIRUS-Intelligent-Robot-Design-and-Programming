Isolation , partial purification and characterization of nuclear retinoic acid receptors from chick skin . Nuclear receptors ( RARs ) for retinoic acid ( RA ) are considered to be the ultimate mediators of the action of RA in the control of cell differentiation and inhibition of tumorigenesis . We have isolated and partially purified and characterized RAR from a RA-responsive tissue , chick embryo skin . The purification steps included Affi-Gel blue chromatography , ultrafiltration , size exclusion chromatography , and preparative isoelectric focusing . The electrofocusing of RAR-[3H]RA complex in ampholines ( pH 3-10 ) revealed that the receptors have an isoelectric pH of 7.5 . Whereas pronase-digested the RAR-[3H]RA complex completely , DNase showed 20-35 % and RNase showed negligible digestive action on the complex . The ligand binding to RAR was completely inhibited by a mercury compound . P10276 - and P10826 -specific antibodies , on Western blot analysis , immunoreacted with a protein having a molecular weight of 50,000 , presumably RAR . Binding affinity studies revealed that biologically active analogs of RA with a free COOH group ( e.g. , 13- DB00982 , RO-13-7410 , Ch 55 , and DB04942 ) showed , like RA , high binding affinity for RAR , whereas biologically ineffective analogs of RA ( e.g. , furyl and pyridyl ) were poor binders . Other groups of retinoids , in which the COOH group was either lacking or blocked , did not bind to RAR whether or not they were biologically active .
