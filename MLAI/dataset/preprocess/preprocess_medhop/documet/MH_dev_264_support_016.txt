Novel real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for simultaneous detection of recurrent fusion genes in acute myeloid leukemia . The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) according to the presence of several recurrent genetic abnormalities . Detection of these abnormalities and other molecular changes is of increasing interest because it contributes to a refined diagnosis and prognostic assessment in AML and enables monitoring of minimal residual disease . These genetic abnormalities can be detected using single RT-PCR , although the screening is still labor intensive and costly . We have developed a novel real-time RT-PCR assay to simultaneously detect 15 AML-associated rearrangements that is a simple and easily applicable method for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories . This method showed 100 % specificity and sensitivity ( 95 % confidence interval , 91 % to 100 % and 92 % to 100 % , respectively ) . The procedure was validated in a series of 105 patients with AML . The method confirmed all translocations detected using standard cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization and some additional undetected rearrangements . Two patients demonstrated two molecular rearrangements simultaneously , with P11274 - P00519 implicated in both , in addition to Q01196 -MECOM in one patient and P29590 - P10276 in another . In conclusion , this novel real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of multiple AML-associated fusion genes is a versatile and sensitive method for reliable screening of recurrent rearrangements in AML .
