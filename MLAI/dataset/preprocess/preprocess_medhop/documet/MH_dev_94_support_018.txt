Phosphorylation of beta-arrestin2 regulates its function in internalization of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors . Beta-arrestins mediate agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors . Previously , we have shown that phosphorylation of beta-arrestin1 by ERKs at DB00133 -412 regulates its association with clathrin and its function in promoting clathrin-mediated internalization of the receptor . In this paper we report that beta-arrestin2 is also phosphorylated , predominantly at residues DB00156 -383 and DB00133 -361 . DB01064 stimulation of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor promotes dephosphorylation of beta-arrestin2 . Mutation of beta-arrestin2 phosphorylation sites to aspartic acid decreases the association of beta-arrestin2 with clathrin , thereby reducing its ability to promote internalization of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor . Its ability to bind and desensitize the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor is , however , unaltered . These results suggest that , analogous to beta-arrestin1 , phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of beta-arrestin2 regulates clathrin-mediated internalization of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor . In contrast to beta-arrestin1 , which is phosphorylated by P27361 and P28482 , phosphorylation of beta-arrestin2 at DB00156 -383 is shown to be mediated by casein kinase II . Recently , it has been reported that phosphorylation of visual arrestin at DB00133 -366 prevents its binding to clathrin . Thus it appears that the function of all arrestin family members in mediating internalization of G protein-coupled receptors is regulated by distinct phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms .
