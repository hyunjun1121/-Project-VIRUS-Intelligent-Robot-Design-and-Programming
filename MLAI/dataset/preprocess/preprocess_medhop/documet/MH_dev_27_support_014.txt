Nox-2 is a modulator of fibrogenesis in kidney allografts . We studied the role of classical phagocytic NADPH oxidase ( Nox ) in the pathogenesis of kidney allograft tubulointerstitial fibrosis . Immunofluorescence studies showed that Nox-2 and P13498 ( electron transfer subunits of Nox ) colocalized in the tubulointerstitium of human kidney allografts . Tubular Nox-2 also colocalized with alpha-SMA in areas of injury , suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Interstitial macrophages ( P34810 (+) ) and myofibroblasts ( alpha-SMA(+) ) expressed Nox-2 while graft infiltrating T cells ( CD3(+) ) and mature fibroblasts ( P26447 (+) ) were Nox-2(-) . These results were confirmed in the Fisher-to-Lewis rat kidney transplant model . Areas of tubulitis were associated with Nox-2 and alpha-SMA , suggestive of EMT . Immunoblot analyses showed that Nox-2 upregulation was associated with oxidative stress ( nitrotyrosine ) and fibrogenesis ( alpha-SMA and phospho- Q15796 ) at 3 weeks and 6 months . Allografts treated with Nox inhibitors ( DPI or apocynin ) for 1 week showed reduced fibronectin and phospho- Q15796 and increased P12830 levels . DB00091 A , TGF-beta1 and angiotensin II increased Nox-2 mRNA levels 2- to 7-fold in vitro ( NRK52E cells ) . Treatment with specific Nox inhibitors ( DPI or apocynin ) prevented the downregulation of P12830 and upregulation of fibronectin transcripts . In aggregate , these studies suggest that Nox-2 is involved in the pathogenesis of allograft tubulointerstitial fibrosis via activation transcription factor Q15796 , EMT and myofibroblasts .
