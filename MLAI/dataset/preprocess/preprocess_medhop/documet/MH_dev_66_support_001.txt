Glucocorticoid-independent repression of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha-stimulated interleukin ( IL ) -6 expression by the glucocorticoid receptor : a potential mechanism for protection against an excessive inflammatory response . TNFα signaling and cytokine levels play a crucial role in cervical immunity and the host response to infections . We investigated the role of liganded and unliganded glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in P05231 and P10145 gene regulation in response to TNFα in the End1/E6E7 immortalized human endocervical epithelial cell line . In the absence of glucocorticoids , both decreasing GR protein levels by an siRNA strategy and results with the GR antagonist DB00834 suggest a role for the unliganded GR in reduction of TNFα-induced P05231 and P10145 mRNA levels in End1/E6E7 cells . Moreover , GR-dependent repression of endogenous P05231 mRNA as well as a minimal P05231 promoter-reporter gene is also demonstrated in COS-1 cells in the absence of GR ligand , suggesting a transcriptional mechanism that is not cell-specific . TNFα induced recruitment of both the unliganded GR and GR-interacting protein type 1 ( Q9Y3R0 ) to the P05231 promoter . This , together with Q9Y3R0 overexpression studies , suggests a function for Q9Y3R0 as a GR co-repressor in this context . TNFα was shown to induce phosphorylation of the unliganded human GR at DB00133 -226 but not DB00133 -211 , unlike dexamethasone , which induced hyperphosphorylation at both serine residues . DB00133 -226 is shown to be required for the ligand-independent GR-mediated repression of P05231 in response to TNFα . Taken together , these results support a model whereby the unliganded GR attenuates TNFα-stimulated P05231 transcription by a mechanism involving selective phosphorylation and recruitment of the unliganded GR and Q9Y3R0 to the P05231 promoter . These findings suggest the presence of a novel autoregulatory mechanism that may prevent overproduction of P05231 in the endocervix , possibly protecting against negative effects of excessive inflammation .
