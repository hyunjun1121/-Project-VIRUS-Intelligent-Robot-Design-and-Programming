Inhibition of innate co-receptor Q9NP99 signaling reduces P01730 (+) T cell activation and prolongs cardiac allograft survival . The innate receptor " triggering-receptor-expressed-on-myeloid-cells-1 " ( Q9NP99 ) enhances downstream signaling of " pattern recognition receptor " ( PRR ) molecules implicated in inflammatory responses . However the mechanistic role of Q9NP99 in chronic heart rejection has yet to be elucidated . We examined the effect of Q9NP99 (+) antigen-presenting cells ( P25054 ) on alloreactive P01730 (+) lymphocytes . Bm12 donor hearts were transplanted into wild-type MHC-class-II-mismatched C57BL/6J recipient mice . Progressive allograft rejection of bm12-donor hearts with decreased organ function , severe vasculopathy and allograft fibrosis was evident within 4 weeks . Q9NP99 (+) CD11b(+) MHC-II(+) F4/80(+) P41597 (+) P25054 and IFNγ-producing P01730 (+) cells were detected during chronic rejection . Peptide inhibition of Q9NP99 attenuated graft vasculopathy , reduced graft-infiltrating leukocytes and prolonged allograft survival , while being accompanied by sustained low levels of P01730 (+) and CD8(+) cell infiltration . Remarkably , temporary inhibition of Q9NP99 during early immune activation was sufficient for long-term allograft survival . Mechanistically , Q9NP99 inhibition leads to reduced differentiation and proliferation of IFNγ-producing Th1 cells . In conclusion , Q9NP99 influences chronic heart rejection by regulating the infiltration and differentiation of P01730 (+) lymphocytes .
