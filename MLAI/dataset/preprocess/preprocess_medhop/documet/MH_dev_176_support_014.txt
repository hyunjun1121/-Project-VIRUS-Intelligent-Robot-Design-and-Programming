Prevention of thrombus formation and growth by antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II-dependent thrombin inhibitors : importance of heparin cofactor II . DB01109 ( HEP ) prevents thrombus formation ( TF ) and thrombus growth ( TG ) , by accelerating thrombin ( THR ) inhibition by antithrombin III ( P01008 ) . Recent studies suggest that dermatan sulphate which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II ( HCII ) , can inhibit TF and TG as effectively as HEP . This study compared the antithrombotic effects of HEP and another agent , DB06271 ( SLX ) which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by P01008 and HCII simultaneously . TF was induced in rabbit jugular veins , using the stasis/hypercoagulation model . TG was measured as the accretion of 125I-fibrin onto existing thrombi in rabbit jugular veins . HEP and SLX inhibited TF when given in doses of 10 and 5 anti-thrombin U/kg , respectively . SLX ( 16 anti-thrombin U/kg or 260 micrograms/kg ) was more effective than HEP ( 120 anti-thrombin U/kg or 800 micrograms/kg ) in preventing TG when administered either as a bolus or by continuous infusion . These data suggest that agents which accelerate THR inhibition by both P01008 and HCII simultaneously , can inhibit TF and TG with less systemic anticoagulation than comparable antithrombotic doses of HEP .
