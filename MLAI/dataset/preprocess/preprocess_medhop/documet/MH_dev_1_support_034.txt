Impact of fish oil enriched total parenteral nutrition on DNA synthesis , cytokine release and receptor expression by lymphocytes in the postoperative period . A prospective randomized study on sixty patients was conducted to investigate the effects of a fish oil containing total parenteral nutrition ( O15533 ) regimen in the postoperative period on lymphocyte subset distribution , proliferation , cytokine production and interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) expression . Patients who underwent large bowel surgery were divided into three groups . Nineteen patients received O15533 with fish oil ( 0.2 g/kg body weight per day ) plus soybean oil ( 1.0 g/kg per day ) , twenty patients received soybean oil ( 1.2 g/kg per day ) , and twenty-one patients who were on a fat-free regimen served as the control group . Natural killer ( NK ) cells , total , B- , T- , DB00451 - , T8-lymphocytes , proliferation of lymphocytes , in vitro production of P60568 , P01579 , P01375 , and IL-2R expression were measured . Fish oil administration did not affect subset distribution and proliferation of lymphocytes . Production of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) , interferon gamma ( P01579 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) was augmented , and IL-2R expression less enhanced compared with the controls . It is concluded that administration of 0.2 g/kg per day fish oil after a moderate surgical stress is not immunosuppressive , but enhances the production of P01579 , P01375 and possibly P60568 .
