Revelation of p53-independent function of Q13330 in DNA damage response via modulation of the P38936 P38936 -proliferating cell nuclear antigen pathway . Although metastasis-associated protein 1 ( Q13330 ) , a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase ( NuRD ) complex , is a DNA-damage response protein and regulates p53-dependent DNA repair , it remains unknown whether Q13330 also participates in p53-independent DNA damage response . Here , we provide evidence that Q13330 is a p53-independent transcriptional corepressor of P38936 ( P38936 ) , and the underlying mechanism involves recruitment of Q13330 -histone deacetylase 2 ( Q92769 ) complexes onto two selective regions of the P38936 ( P38936 ) promoter . Accordingly , Q13330 depletion , despite its effect on p53 down-regulation , superinduces P38936 ( P38936 ) , increases P38936 ( P38936 ) binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , and decreases the nuclear accumulation of P12004 in response to ionizing radiation . In support of a p53-independent role of Q13330 in DNA damage response , we further demonstrate that induced expression of Q13330 in p53-null cells inhibits P38936 ( P38936 ) promoter activity and P38936 ( P38936 ) binding to P12004 . Consequently , Q13330 expression in p53-null cells results in increased induction of gamma P16104 foci and DNA double strand break repair , and decreased DNA damage sensitivity following ionizing radiation treatment . These findings uncover a new target of Q13330 and the existence of an additional p53-independent role of Q13330 in DNA damage response , at least in part , by modulating the P38936 ( P38936 )- P12004 pathway , and thus , linking two previously unconnected NuRD complex and DNA-damage response pathways .
