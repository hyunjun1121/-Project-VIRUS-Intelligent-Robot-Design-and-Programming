Task-dependent interactions between dopamine D2 receptor polymorphisms and DB01235 in patients with Parkinson 's disease . Variants in genes regulating dopamine transmission affect performance on tasks including working memory and executive function as well as temporal processing and sequence learning . In the current study , we determined whether a dopamine D2 receptor DNA sequence polymorphism interacts with DB01235 during motor tasks in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Forty-five PD patients were genotyped for the P14416 polymorphism ( rs 1076560 , G > T ) . Patients performed an explicit motor sequence learning task and the grooved pegboard test in both ON and OFF DB01235 states . For motor sequence learning , P14416 genotype mediated DB01235 effects such that DB01235 associated improvements were only observed in the minor T allele carriers ( associated with lower D2 receptor availability , t10=-2.71 , p=0.022 ) , whereas G homozygotes showed no performance change with DB01235 . For the grooved pegboard test , performance improved with DB01235 independent of patients ' P14416 genotype . Collectively these results demonstrate that common P14416 allelic differences found in the human population may explain how dopamine differentially contributes to performance across tasks and individuals .
