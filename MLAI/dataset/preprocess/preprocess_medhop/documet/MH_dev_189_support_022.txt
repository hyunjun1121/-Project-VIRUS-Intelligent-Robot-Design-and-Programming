Inhibition of P08183 does not sensitize primitive chronic myeloid leukemia P28906 + cells to imatinib . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the interaction of imatinib mesylate ( IM ) with the clinically relevant adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette efflux transporter P08183 ( P08183 ) in cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) and to explore whether inhibition of this transporter would improve IM 's efficacy in the elimination of CML P28906 (+) cells by increasing cell-associated drug accumulation . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Cells from newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients were harvested by leukapheresis and enriched to > 95 % P28906 (+) . Expression of the transporter gene P08183 was performed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . Interaction of IM with P08183 was analyzed by substrate ( rhodamine 123 ) displacement assay . Cell-associated levels of IM in CML P28906 (+) cells were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography . Intracellular phospho-CrkL levels , apoptosis in total CML P28906 (+) cells and high-resolution tracking of cell division were assayed by flow cytometry . RESULTS : Measurements of cell-associated IM uptake showed significantly lower drug levels in P28906 (+) cells , particularly the P28907 (-) subpopulation , as compared to IM-sensitive K562 cells . P08183 was expressed at low level and dye efflux studies demonstrated very little P08183 activity in CML P28906 (+) cells . Furthermore , combination treatment of primitive CML cells with IM and the P08183 inhibitor PSC833 did not result in elevated cell-associated IM levels . Although we observed slightly enhanced cytostasis with IM when combined with PSC833 , this was independent of P11274 - P00519 inhibition because no associated decrease in phospho-CrkL was observed . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of P08183 neither enhances the effect of IM against P11274 - P00519 activity , nor significantly potentiates IM 's efficiency in eliminating primitive CML cells .
