The HDAC inhibitor LBH589 induces P29323 -dependent prometaphase arrest in prostate cancer via Q9UBN7 inactivation and down-regulation . Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACIs ) have potent anti-cancer activity in a variety of cancer models . Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic responsiveness of HDACI is needed before its clinical application . This study aimed to determine if a potent HDACI , LBH589 ( DB06603 ) , had differential therapeutic responsiveness towards LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells . The former showed prometaphase arrest with subsequent apoptosis upon LBH589 treatment , while the latter was less sensitive and had late G2 arrest . The LBH589 treatment down-regulated Q9UBN7 and sustained P29323 activation , and contributed to prometaphase arrest . Mechanistically , LBH589 inhibited Q9UBN7 activity , caused its dissociation from protein phosphatase PP1α , and increased 14-3-3ζ acetylation . Acetylated 14-3-3ζ released its mask effect on serine 259 of c-Raf and serine 216 of Cdc25C subsequent to de-phosphorylation by PP1α , which contributed to P29323 activation . Enhanced P29323 activity by LBH589 further down-regulated Q9UBN7 protein levels and sustained P29323 activation by free-forward regulation . The sustained Cdc25C and P29323 activation resulted in early M-phase ( prometaphase ) arrest and subsequent apoptosis in the most sensitive LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells . This study provides pre-clinical evidence that Q9UBN7 may serve as a sensitive therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer with HDACI LBH589 for clinical translation . This study also posits a novel mechanism of Q9UBN7 participation in regulating the c-Raf- P50391 - P29323 signaling pathway and contributing to M phase cell-cycle transition .
