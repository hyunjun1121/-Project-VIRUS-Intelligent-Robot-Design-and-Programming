Tyrosine phosphorylation of Q92835 promotes its proteasomal degradation . OBJECTIVE : The activity of the SH2-containing-phosphatidylinositol-5'-phosphatase ( Q92835 , also known as Q92835 ) , a critical hematopoietic-restricted negative regulator of the P19957 kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , is regulated in large part via its protein levels . We sought to determine the mechanism(s) involved in its downregulation by P11274 - P00519 and by interleukin ( IL ) -4 . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We used Ba/ P13726 ( Q92817 -tetOFF) cells to study the downregulation of Q92835 by P11274 - P00519 and bone marrow-derived macrophages to study Q92835 's downregulation by P05112 . RESULTS : We show herein that P11274 - P00519 downregulates Q92835 , but not O15357 or P60484 , and this can be blocked with the Src kinase inhibitor Q99463 , which inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of Q92835 , or with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 . We also show , using anti- Q92835 immunoprecipitates , that c-Cbl and Cbl-b are associated with Q92835 and that P11274 - P00519 induces Q92835 's polyubiquitination . This ubiquitination can be blocked with Q99463 , consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Q92835 acting as a signal for its ubiquitination . In bone marrow-derived macrophages , P05112 also leads to the proteasomal degradation of Q92835 but , unlike in Ba/ P13726 ( Q92817 -tetOFF) cells , O15357 is also proteasomally degraded and the degradation of both inositol phosphatases can be prevented with Q99463 or MG-132 . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that Q92835 protein levels can be reduced via P11274 - P00519 and/or Src family member-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Q92835 because this triggers its polyubiquitination and degradation within the proteasome .
