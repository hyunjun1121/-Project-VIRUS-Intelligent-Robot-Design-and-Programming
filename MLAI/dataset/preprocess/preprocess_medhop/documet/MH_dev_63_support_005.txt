Ectopic DB01285 syndrome caused by bronchial carcinoid tumor indistinguishable from Cushing 's disease . A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a poor glycemic control . She was found to have Cushingoid feature and dynamic endocrine tests showed elevated plasma DB01285 and cortisol levels , lack of their circadian rhythm , non-suppressibility to high-dose dexamethasone , responsiveness to P06850 , but not to DB00035 , and suppression to octreotide . Pituitary Q9BWK5 showed an equivocal small lesion . CT scan of the chest showed two nodular lesions in the right lung ( S5 , S7 ) , while a mild uptake was noted only in S5 lesion by DB09150 -PET , but positive uptake was only in S7 lesion by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) . Inferior petrosal sinus sampling revealed a gradient of plasma DB01285 after P06850 stimulation , consistent with the diagnosis of Cushing ' s disease . She underwent middle and inferior lobectomy of the right lung . The resected tumor in S7 was consistent with the diagnosis of a bronchial carcinoid tumor with positive DB01285 immunoreactivity , while that of S5 was cryptococcal granuloma . RT-PCR revealed abundant expressions of P01189 and SSTR ( -1 , -2 , -5 ) , but not of P34998 and P47901 . Postoperatively , abnormal endocrine data were normalized along with improvement of hypertension and diabetes . This was a diagnostic challenging case with ectopic DB01285 syndrome indistinguishable from Cushing ' s disease by various endocrine and imaging tests , among which SRS successfully localized the tumor responsible for ectopic DB01285 secretion .
