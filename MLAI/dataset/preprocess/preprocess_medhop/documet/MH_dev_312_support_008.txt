Echicetin coated polystyrene beads : a novel tool to investigate GPIb-specific platelet activation and aggregation. P04275 /ristocetin ( P04275 /R ) induces GPIb-dependent platelet agglutination and activation of αIIbβ3 integrin , which also binds P04275 . These conditions make it difficult to investigate GPIb-specific signaling pathways in washed platelets . Here , we investigated the specific mechanisms of GPIb signaling using echicetin-coated polystyrene beads , which specifically activate GPIb . We compared platelet activation induced by echicetin beads to P04275 /R . Human platelets were stimulated with polystyrene beads coated with increasing amounts of echicetin and platelet activation by echicetin beads was then investigated to reveal GPIb specific signaling . Echicetin beads induced αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation of washed platelets , while under the same conditions P04275 /R treatment led only to αIIbβ3-independent platelet agglutination . The average distance between the echicetin molecules on the polystyrene beads must be less than 7 nm for full platelet activation , while the total amount of echicetin used for activation is not critical . Echicetin beads induced strong phosphorylation of several proteins including p38 , P29323 and P31749 . Synergistic signaling via Q9H244 and thromboxane receptor through secreted ADP and TxA2 , respectively , were important for echicetin bead triggered platelet activation . Activation of PKG by the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway inhibited echicetin bead-induced platelet aggregation . Echicetin-coated beads are powerful and reliable tools to study signaling in human platelets activated solely via GPIb and GPIb-triggered pathways .
