L-NAME , an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , blocks the established allodynia induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin E2 . We recently reported that intrathecal ( i.t. ) administration of prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) to conscious mice induced allodynia , a state of discomfort and pain evoked by innocuous tactile stimuli . In the present study , we examined the effect of the P34995 antagonist ONO-NT-012 , the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist MK-801 , and the NO synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) on the allodynia . The DB00917 -induced allodynia was blocked by simultaneous i.t. injection of ONO-NT-012 , MK-801 , or L-NAME . However , 5 min after i.t. injection of DB00917 , the allodynia was significantly blocked by i.t . L-NAME , but not by i.t . ONO-NT-012 or MK-801 . These results demonstrate that the DB00917 -induced allodynia , once developed , does not require the continued agonist occupancy of EP1 and DB01221 glutamate receptor sites .
