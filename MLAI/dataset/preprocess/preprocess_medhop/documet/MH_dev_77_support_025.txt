Rescue of exocytosis in botulinum toxin A-poisoned chromaffin cells by expression of cleavage-resistant P60880 . Identification of the minimal essential C-terminal residues . Botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) types A and B selectively block exocytosis by cleavage of P60880 and synaptobrevin , respectively ; in humans , many months are required for full recovery from the resultant neuromuscular paralysis . To decipher the molecular basis for such prolonged poisoning , intoxication in adreno-chromaffin cells was monitored over 2 months . Exocytosis from BoNT/B-treated cells resumed after 56 days because of the appearance of intact synaptobrevin . However , inhibition continued in DB00083 -treated cells , throughout the same interval , with a continued predominance of cleaved P60880 -(1-197) over the intact protein . When recovery from poisoning was attempted by transfection of the latter cells with the gene encoding full-length P60880 -(1-206) , no restoration of exocytosis ensued even after 3 weeks . To ascertain if this failure was because of the persistence of the toxin 's protease activity , the cells were transfected with DB00083 -resistant P60880 constructs ; importantly , exocytosis was rescued . C-terminal truncation of the toxin-insensitive P60880 revealed that residues 1-201 , 1-202 , 1-203 afforded a significant return of exocytosis , unlike shorter forms 1-197 , -198 , -199 , or -200 ; accordingly , mutants M202A or L203A of full-length P60880 rescued secretion . These findings give insights into the C-terminal functional domain of P60880 , demonstrate the longevity of DB00083 protease , and provide the prospect of a therapy for botulism .
