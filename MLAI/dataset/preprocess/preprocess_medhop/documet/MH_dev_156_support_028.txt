P35354 -derived prostacyclin confers atheroprotection on female mice . Female gender affords relative protection from cardiovascular disease until the menopause . We report that estrogen acts on estrogen receptor subtype alpha to up-regulate the production of atheroprotective prostacyclin , DB01240 , by activation of cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) . This mechanism restrained both oxidant stress and platelet activation that contribute to atherogenesis in female mice . Deletion of the P43119 removed the atheroprotective effect of estrogen in ovariectomized female mice . This suggests that chronic treatment of patients with selective inhibitors of P35354 could undermine protection from cardiovascular disease in premenopausal females .
