[ DB01276 : first once weekly P43220 agonist ( exenatide P10586 ) ] . DB01276 is a new galenic formulation ( long-acting release ) of exenatide , the first agonist of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptors having been commercialized for the management of type 2 diabetes . The microsphere technology permits a prolonged absorption of exenatide from the subcutaneous depot , which allows one injection per week instead of two injections per day with the initial formulation of exenatide ( DB01276 ) . The clinical development programme DURATION showed that exenatide 2 mg once weekly more markedly reduces glycated haemoglobin ( HbA(1c) ) , with a similar weight loss but a better digestive tolerance profile ( less nausea and vomiting after treatment initiation ) , compared with the twice daily 10 microg exenatide . When compared to other glucose-lowering agents , once weekly exenatide is more efficacious than sitagliptin , pioglitazone or basal insulin ( glargine or detemir ) , with the advantage of producing weight loss and lowering arterial blood pressure . It does not induce hypoglycaemia and does not necessarily require home blood glucose monitoring , two advantages compared with insulin therapy . DB01276 is currently only reimbursed in Belgium after failure of and in addition to metformin-sulfonylurea combination .
