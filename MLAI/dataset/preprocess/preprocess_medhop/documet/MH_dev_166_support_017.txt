P14210 and P04626 /neu downregulate expression of apoptosis-inducing factor in non-small cell lung cancer . Our previous study showed that patients with advanced stages of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) were frequently detected with upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) . In vitro , P14210 reduced expression of apoptosis-inducing factor ( O95831 ) and cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC cells . The effect of P14210 was via P08581 ( c-MET ) and the downstream effector , focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) . In this study , we determined the prognostic value of O95831 in NSCLC patients . O95831 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting . Our data show that O95831 expression was associated with better prognosis . Expression of O95831 inversely correlated with that of positive NSCLC markers , e.g. , dihydrodiol dehydrogenase ( Q04828 ) , c-MET , short oncostatin M receptor ( OSMRs ) , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 , and P04626 /neu , which were closely associated with drug resistance , tumor recurrence , metastasis and poor prognosis . Noteworthy , silence of P04626 /neu gene expression increases O95831 level and drug sensitivity . Addition of P14210 inhibits O95831 expression in P04626 /neu-silenced cells . These results suggested that both P14210 and P04626 /neu affect drug resistance by regulating O95831 expression in NSCLC .
