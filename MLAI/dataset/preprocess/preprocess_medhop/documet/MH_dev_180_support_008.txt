Efficacy of liraglutide as a follow-up therapy after resolution of glucotoxicity with intensive insulin therapy . OBJECTIVE : To assess the utility of liraglutide , a P43220 agonist , as additional therapy following resolution of glucotoxicity with insulin therapy . METHODS : The subjects were 13 Japanese patients with short-duration type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 2.0 ± 2.1 years ) . At first , treatment with insulin therapy consisted of bolus insulin before each meal and basal insulin at bed time commenced to improve every preprandial glucose levels below 130 mg/dL . Then , insulin therapy was replaced with liraglutide monotherapy in case in which 50 % or more self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) tests revealed preprandial glucose levels of less than 130 mg/dL at least for one month . DB06655 dosing was initiated at 0.3 mg/day and increased in weekly or biweekly increments of 0.3 mg/day , to the maximum permissible dose ( in Japan ) of 0.9 mg/day . The participants were treated with liraglutide for 24 weeks . RESULTS : The average insulin therapy period was 13.2 ± 5.4 weeks , and insulin therapy significantly improved HbA1c values from 12.4 % ± 1.6 % to 6.8 % ± 0.9 % ( P < 0.05 ) . After improvement of hyperglycemia with insulin therapy and switching to liraglutide monotherapy for 24 weeks , HbA1c values remained constant ( 6.2 % ± 1.0 % at week 24 ) and the rates of hypoglycemic episodes significantly decreased ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : These data suggest that liraglutide is proposed as an alternative follow-up therapy subsequent to eliminate glucotoxicity with insulin therapy .
