Expression of aberrant HLA- Q8TCY5 molecules is dependent on Q8TCY5 dosage and peptide supply . OBJECTIVES : Cellular expression of non-classical forms of human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) - Q8TCY5 ( NC- Q8TCY5 ) may be involved in spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) pathogenesis . We used a novel Q8TCY5 -specific monoclonal antibody , Q9UBN7 , to ask if Q8TCY5 transgenic ( TG ) rat splenocytes express these NC- Q8TCY5 molecules . We also investigated whether Q8TCY5 -binding peptides could affect the expression and functional immune recognition of Q9UBN7 -reactive Q8TCY5 molecules . METHODS : Splenocytes from Q8TCY5 -TG , P33681 -TG and non-transgenic rats , and HLA- Q8TCY5 + cell lines were stained with monoclonal antibodies recognising classical ( ME-1 , HLA-ABC-m1 ) and non-classical ( Q9UBN7 , HC10 ) Q8TCY5 . Cells were further cultured in the presence of HLA- Q8TCY5 -binding peptides , or subjected to brief low pH treatment prior to mAb staining and/or immunoprecipitation or co-culture with P43630 -CD3ε-expressing Jurkat reporter cells . RESULTS : Q9UBN7 -reactive molecules were detected in the majority of adult Q8TCY5 -TG rat splenocyte cell subsets , increasing with age and concomitant increased Q8TCY5 expression . Q9UBN7 staining was inhibited by incubation with Q8TCY5 -binding peptides and induced by low pH treatment . Q9UBN7 staining correlated with P43630 -CD3ε-expressing Jurkat reporter cell activity . Thus , P60568 production was decreased when Q8TCY5 -expressing antigen-presenting cells were preincubated with Q8TCY5 -binding peptides , but increased following pretreatment with low pH buffer . CONCLUSIONS : Surface expression of Q9UBN7 -reactive Q8TCY5 molecules on Q8TCY5 -TG rat splenocytes is consistent with a pathogenic role for NC- Q8TCY5 in SpA . Interaction of NC- Q8TCY5 with innate immune receptors could be critical in SpA pathogenesis , and we show that this may be influenced by the availability and composition of the Q8TCY5 -binding peptide pool .
