Anti-tumor effect of vitamin A and D on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . OBJECTIVES : DB00162 and D(3) have a very strong differentiation induction effect . STUDY DESIGN : We examined the anti tumor effect on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) by treatment with several vitamins having strong differentiation induction effects in vitro . METHODS : We used KB cell that an oral floor squamous cell carcinoma , vitamins as all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) , 4- [ 3,5-bis ( trimethylsilyl ) benzamido ] benzoic acid ( TAC-101 ) , 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) ( calcitriol ) and 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) ( O75051 ) . We determined receptors of vitamin A and D(3) using RT-PCR . Furthermore , we investigated the proliferation of tumor cells in concentration dependency using [3H]TdR uptake method , apoptosis and apoptosis related factors using TUNEL method and real-time PCR , cell cycle changes using flow cytometry , changing of the sensitivity of using MTT method , cytokine production and the angiogenesis factor using ELISA , by treatment with these vitamins . RESULTS : The deficit of P10826 was found in the KB cell . Each vitamin suppressed the cell proliferation , induced apoptosis , and cell cycle arrest , upregulated sensitivity of the chemotherapeutics drugs and downregulated several angiogenesis factors and an apoptotic factor ; survivin . CONCLUSIONS : These results support the idea that vitamin A , D(3) and their derivatives are useful for preventing and/or treating patients with HNSCC .
