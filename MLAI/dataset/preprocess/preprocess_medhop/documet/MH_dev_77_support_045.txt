Excess nitric oxide impairs LXR(α)- O95477 -dependent cholesterol efflux in macrophage foam cells . Excess nitric oxide ( NO ) promotes the progression of atherosclerosis by increasing the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and inflammatory responses . However , little is known about the impact of NO and its underlying molecular mechanism on lipid metabolism of macrophage foam cells . In this study , Oil-red O staining , cholesterol and triglyceride assay , Dil-oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) binding assay , cholesterol efflux assay , real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used for in vitro experiments . P02649 -deficient ( apoE(-/-) ) and apoE and inducible nitric oxide synthase-deficient ( apoE(-/-) P35228 (-/-) ) mice were as our in vivo models . Treatment with S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine ( P60880 ) , an NO donor , exacerbated oxLDL-induced cholesterol accumulation in macrophages , because of reduced efficacy of cholesterol efflux . In addition , P60880 decreased the protein level of DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) without affecting scavenger receptor type A ( SR-A ) , P16671 , P45844 , or SR-B1 levels . This P60880 -mediated downregulation of O95477 was mainly through the effect of NO but not peroxynitrite . Furthermore , the P60880 -downregulated O95477 was due to the decrease in the liver X receptor α ( LXRα ) -dependent transcriptional regulation . Moreover , genetic deletion of P35228 increased the serum capacity of reverse cholesterol efflux and protein expression of LXRα , O95477 , and Q8WTV0 in aortas and retarded atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice . Our findings provide new insights in the pro-atherogenic effect of excess NO on cholesterol metabolism in macrophages .
