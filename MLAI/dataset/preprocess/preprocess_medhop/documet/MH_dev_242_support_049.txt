Potentiation by neuropeptide Y of 5HT2A receptor-mediated contraction in porcine coronary artery . Potentiation by neuropeptide Y of serotonin ( 5-HT ) -induced vasoconstriction was investigated in porcine coronary artery . 5-HT caused concentration-dependent contraction through 5- Q13049 receptors . Neuropeptide Y ( 30 nM ) significantly increased the 5HT-induced contraction by 16+/-5 % in arteries with intact endothelium . Removal of the endothelium abolished the potentiation . A neuropeptide Q03519 antagonist , BIBP3226 , blocked this neuropeptide Y-induced potentiation . In vessels with intact endothelium , the potentiation by neuropeptide Y was inhibited by in the presence of a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor , indomethacin ( 30 microM ) , but not by the presence of P25101 or ETB endothelin receptor antagonists or an NO synthase inhibitor , NG-nitro-L-arginine ( DB04223 ) ( 1 mM ) at all . A thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) synthase inhibitor , ozagrel , and prostanoid TP receptor antagonists , seratrodast and ONO-3708 , also inhibited the neuropeptide Y-induced potentiation . In the endothelium-denuded arteries , a prostanoid TP receptor agonist , U-46619 ( 0.01-0.1 nM ) , potentiated 5-HT-induced contraction . These results indicate that neuropeptide Y potentiates the 5-HT-induced contraction , due to release of TXA2 from the endothelium via neuropeptide Q03519 receptors , in porcine coronary artery .
