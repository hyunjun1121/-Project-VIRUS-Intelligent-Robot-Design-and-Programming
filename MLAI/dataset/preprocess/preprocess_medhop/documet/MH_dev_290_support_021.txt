Alteration of contractile properties to serotonin in gastric fundus smooth muscle isolated from streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -induced diabetic rats . Contractile responses to serotonin ( 5-HT ) of fundic smooth muscle strips isolated from both control and streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -induced diabetic rats were investigated . Contrary to carbachol ( CCh ) which causes contractile hyperactivity in DM , 5-HT response tended to decrease in DM compared to that of the control . Pindolol ( 10(-5)M ) increased the value of EC50 of the concentration-response to 5-HT about 2.5 times in both the control and DM . After treatment with pindolol , the maximal tension to 5-HT in DM significantly decreased compared to that of the control . Pindolol showed no effect on the contractile response to CCh . Pindolol significantly inhibited the relaxation caused by isoproterenol in DM more than in the control . DB06148 ( 10(-5) M ) increased the EC50 of the response to 5-HT about 2-2.5 times in both groups , but did not cause a significant difference between the control and DM . The Ca(2+)-induced contraction caused hyperreactivity in DM in the presence of 10(-6) M CCh , but that in DM was not significantly different from the control in the presence of 10(-6) M 5-HT . Pretreatment of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA , 10(-5) M ) significantly attenuated the response to 5-HT in the control , but not in DM . Results suggest that the contractile response to 5-HT in DM is related to the altered Ca2+ signal transduction system via disturbed protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity , and that there are alterations of receptor characteristics and of the density in 5-HT receptor subtypes , especially P08908 , during DM development .
