P37231 regulates P12830 expression and inhibits growth and invasion of prostate cancer . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) might not be permissive to ligand activation in prostate cancer cells . Association of PPARgamma with repressing factors or posttranslational modifications in PPARgamma protein could explain the lack of effect of PPARgamma ligands in a recent randomized clinical trial . Using cells and prostate cancer xenograft mouse models , we demonstrate in this study that a combination treatment using the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid is more efficient at inhibiting prostate tumor growth than each individual therapy . We show that the combination treatment impairs the bone-invasive potential of prostate cancer cells in mice . In addition , we demonstrate that expression of P12830 , a protein involved in the control of cell migration and invasion , is highly up-regulated in the presence of valproic acid and pioglitazone . We show that P12830 expression responds only to the combination treatment and not to single PPARgamma agonists , defining a new class of PPARgamma target genes . These results open up new therapeutic perspectives in the treatment of prostate cancer .
