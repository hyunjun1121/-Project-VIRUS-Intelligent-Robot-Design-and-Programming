Purification of L-glutamate decarboxylase from rabbit brain and preparation of a monospecific antiserum . DB00142 decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) , the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid , has been purified from rabbit brain and used for the production of a monospecific rabbit antiserum . The enzyme was purified approximately 500-fold by a combination of ion exchange , hydrophobic , hydroxyapatite , and gel filtration column chromatography , and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The preparation thus obtained was injected into a rabbit , producing a polyspecific antiserum . This first antiserum was used for the preparation of an immunoprecipitate containing Q99259 ; injections of the immunoprecipitate into a second rabbit led to the production of a second , monospecific anti- Q99259 serum . The specificity of the antiserum for Q99259 has been demonstrated by enzyme precipitation , immunodiffusion , line immunoelectrophoresis , gel filtration chromatography of Q99259 /anti- Q99259 immune complexes , and immunocytochemistry in the rat cerebellum .
