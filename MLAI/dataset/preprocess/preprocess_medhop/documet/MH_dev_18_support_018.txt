Inhibition of the T790M gatekeeper mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor by EXEL-7647 . PURPOSE : Agents inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) have shown clinical benefit in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer patients expressing amplified or mutationally activated P00533 . However , responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for P00533 gene mutations that confer resistance to DB00171 competitive P00533 inhibitors , such as erlotinib and gefitinib . We describe here the activity of EXEL-7647 ( DB05007 ) , a novel spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the P01133 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase families , against both wild-type ( WT ) and mutant P00533 in vitro and in vivo . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The activity of P00533 inhibitors against WT and mutant EGFRs and their effect on downstream signal transduction was examined in cellular assays and in vivo using A431 and MDA-MB-231 ( WT P00533 ) and H1975 ( L858R and T790M mutant P00533 ) xenograft tumors . RESULTS : EXEL-7647 shows potent and long-lived inhibition of the WT P00533 in vivo . In addition , EXEL-7647 inhibits cellular proliferation and P00533 pathway activation in the erlotinib-resistant H1975 cell line that harbors a double mutation ( L858R and T790M ) in the P00533 gene . In vivo efficacy studies show that EXEL-7647 substantially inhibited the growth of H1975 xenograft tumors and reduced both tumor P00533 signaling and tumor vessel density . Additionally , EXEL-7647 , in contrast to erlotinib , substantially inhibited the growth and vascularization of MDA-MB-231 xenografts , a model which is more reliant on signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor receptors . CONCLUSIONS : These studies provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials of DB05007 in solid tumors and in patients bearing tumors that are resistant to existing P00533 -targeted therapies .
