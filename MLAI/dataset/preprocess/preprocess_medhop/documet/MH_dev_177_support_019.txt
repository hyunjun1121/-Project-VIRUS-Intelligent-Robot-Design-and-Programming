Role of nucleotide sequences in the V3 region in efficient replication of P51681 -utilizing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in macrophages . Macrophages express both P61073 and P51681 coreceptors , but restrict X4 HIV-1 replication unless the Env-V3 region , a major determinant of cell tropism , is exchanged with that of R5 HIV-1 . As the V3 exchange concomitantly alters the nucleotide sequences , we introduced silent mutations in the V3 or P06681 region of macrophage-tropic R5 JRFL without changing the amino acids . Immunoblot analysis confirmed that viral proteins including Env-gp120 were similarly incorporated in wild-type ( wt ) and mutant virions . The silent mutants infected P51681 -positive MAGIC5 cells but not P51681 -negative MAGI cells , as productively as wt viruses , indicating that the silent mutations did not alter coreceptor utilization . In contrast , two of three silent V3-mutant viruses failed to replicate efficiently in primary macrophages , whereas other V3- or P06681 -mutants and wt JRFL infected macrophages productively . Furthermore , synthesis of the full-length viral DNA of the aberrant V3-mutant was largely reduced in macrophages . These results suggest that V3 nucleotide sequences may be one of the postentry factors restricting HIV-1 replication in macrophages .
