P21728 behavioral responsitivity following selective lesions of the striatal patch compartment during development . The behavioral effects of selective destruction of the dopamine ( DA ) input to the patch compartment of rat striatum early in development was investigated . Rat pups were given bilateral intrastriatal ( i.s. ) injections of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA ) on day of birth ( P0 ) or postnatal day 1 ( P1 ) , which resulted in selective behavioral alterations following DA agonist treatment in adulthood . Neonatally-lesioned rats exhibited self-biting behavior following treatment with the DA precursor L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DB01235 ) . In response to treatment with the selective D1 agonist SKF38393 , there was an increased incidence of abnormal perioral movements . The cataleptogenic effects of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 and the D2 antagonist haloperidol were also studied . Neonatally-lesioned rats were significantly less cataleptic compared to control rats following D1 antagonist treatment , but not following D2 antagonist treatment . Autoradiographs of [3H]mazindol binding to DA uptake sites ( a measure of DA terminal density ) showed a ' patchy ' loss of approx . 40-50 % in striatal tissue sections derived from the i.s. lesioned rats . These data suggest that injections of 6-OHDA into the striatum during this early postnatal period cause a DA lesion that results in long-term effects on a D1 receptor system .
