Antibody-based immunotherapy for ovarian cancer : where are we at ? Cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy continue to be the mainstay of ovarian cancer treatment . However , as mortality from advanced ovarian cancer remains very high , novel therapies are required to be integrated into existing treatment regimens . Immunotherapy represents an alternative and rational therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer based on a body of evidence supporting a protective role of the immune system against these cancers , and on the clinical success of immunotherapy in other malignancies . Whether or not immunotherapy will have a role in the future management of ovarian cancer is too early to tell , but research in this field is active . This review will discuss recent clinical developments of selected immunotherapies for ovarian cancer which fulfil the following criteria : ( i ) they are antibody-based , ( ii ) target a distinct immunological pathway , and ( iii ) have reached the clinical trial stage . Specifically , the focus is on Catumaxomab ( anti-EpCAMÃ—anti-CD3 ) , Abagovomab , DB04964 ( anti- Q8WXI7 ) , DB00111 ( anti-CD25 ) , DB06186 ( anti- P16410 ) , and MXD-1105 ( anti- Q9NZQ7 ) . Catumaxomab has reached phase III clinical trials and exhibits promise with reports , showing that it can cause a significant and sustained reduction in ascites . Phase I-III clinical trials continue to be conducted on the other antibodies , some of which have had encouraging reports . We will also provide our perspective on the future of immunotherapy for ovarian cancer , and how it may be best employed in treatment regimens .
