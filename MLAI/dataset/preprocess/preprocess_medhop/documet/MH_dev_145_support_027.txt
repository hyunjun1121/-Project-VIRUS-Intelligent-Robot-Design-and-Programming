DB09037 . The development of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab and its approval in 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has heralded a new era in immuno-oncology . Subsequently , novel agents against the programmed death receptor 1 ( P18621 ) /programmed death receptor ligand 1 ( Q9NZQ7 ) axis have shown significant activity in melanoma and a variety of other tumor types . DB09037 was the first anti- P18621 antibody to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab , and if P15056 ( V600 ) mutation positive , a P15056 inhibitor . DB09037 has also received breakthrough status for the treatment of P00533 mutation-negative , Q9UM73 rearrangement-negative non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) that has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy . There remain a number of pivotal trials in progress to further evaluate the optimal use of pembrolizumab alone and in combination for melanoma , NSCLC , and other tumor types . In this article , we review the efficacy and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab and evaluate its future development .
