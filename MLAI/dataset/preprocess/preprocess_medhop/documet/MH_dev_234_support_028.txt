[ Rizatriptan : experience after 15 years of clinical use ] . We review the development of rizatriptan , one of the seven P28222 /1D agonists available for the symptomatic treatment of migraine , emphasizing the most relevant contributions carried out from our country . Rizatriptan has shown the quickest onset of action , both in controlled studies and in the different metaanalyses , which translates in high efficacy levels at two hours . Its tolerability and safety profile is similar to that of the other compounds in this pharmacological group . Postlaunching studies have shown that its high efficacy leads to pharmacoeconomic savings and to a robust preference and satisfaction by the patient for this DB00669 . Its efficacy is improved with an early use within migraine attacks and recent data have shown also efficacy in adolescents . This global profile places rizatriptan as a DB00669 of first choice for any kind of migraine attacks .
