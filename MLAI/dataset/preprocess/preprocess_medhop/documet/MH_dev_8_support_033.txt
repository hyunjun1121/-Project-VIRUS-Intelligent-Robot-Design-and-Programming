Target-based agents against ErbB receptors and their ligands : a novel approach to cancer treatment . The ErbB receptors and their cognate ligands that belong to the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family of peptides are involved in the pathogenesis of different types of carcinomas . In fact , the ErbB receptors and the P01133 -like growth factors are frequently expressed in human tumors . These proteins form a complex system that regulates the proliferation and the survival of cancer cells . Therefore , ErbB receptors and their ligands might represent suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches in human carcinomas . In this regard , different target-based agents that are directed against the ErbB receptors have been developed in the past two decades . One of these compounds , the humanized anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer . The anti- P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) antibody C225 , as well as P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ZD1839 and DB00530 are currently in phase III clinical development . Several other ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in phase I/II studies . These compounds have generally been shown to have an acceptable toxicity profile and promising anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients . The mechanisms of action of these compounds , as well as the potential therapeutic strategies to improve their efficacy are discussed in this review with particular regard to the combinations of anti-ErbB agents with cytotoxic drugs , or combinations of different ErbB-targeting agents .
