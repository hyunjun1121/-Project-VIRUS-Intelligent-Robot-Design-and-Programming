Effect of progesterone on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in human myometrial smooth muscle cells . Although it is well known that progesterone alters uterine contractility and plays an important role in maintenance of pregnancy , the biochemical mechanisms by which progesterone alters uterine contractility in human gestation are less clear . In this investigation we sought to identify progesterone-induced adaptations in human myometrial smooth muscle cells that may alter Ca2+ signaling in response to contractile agents . Cells were treated with vehicle or the progesterone analog medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DB00603 ) for 5 days , and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) was quantified after treatment with oxytocin ( OX ) or endothelin ( ET ) -1 . OX- and ET-1-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were significantly attenuated in cells pretreated with DB00603 in a dose-dependent manner . P06401 antagonists prevented the attenuated Ca2+ transients induced by DB00603 . P25101 and ETB receptor subtypes were expressed in myometrial cells , and treatment with DB00603 resulted in significant downregulation of P25101 and ETB receptor binding . DB00603 did not alter ionomycin-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and had no effect on inositol trisphosphate-dependent or -independent release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores . We conclude that adaptations of Ca2+ homeostasis in myometrial cells during pregnancy may include progesterone-induced modification of receptor-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i .
