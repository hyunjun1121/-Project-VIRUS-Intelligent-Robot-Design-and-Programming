Comparison of the effects of cytoprotective drugs on human plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels with continual stress exposure . Cetraxate hydrochloride ( cetraxate ) , ecabet sodium ( ecabet ) , and sulpiride , which are cytoprotective drugs , have been used to treat peptic ulcers and acute or chronic gastritis . They are reported to improve mucosal blood flow in the stomach . One of the most important factors believed to cause gastric ulcers is mental and/or physiological stress . When people feel stress , the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis is activated . Therefore , corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) , and cortisol can be indicators of stress . We examined the effects of cetraxate , ecabet and sulpiride on the plasma levels of DB01285 and cortisol under stress conditions by repetitive blood sampling . Venous blood samples were taken before and 20-240 min after a single administration of the drugs or a placebo . A single dose of ecabet caused significant suppression of increases in plasma DB01285 -like immunoreactive substance ( IS ) levels at 90 to 120 min and cortisol levels at 240 min , compared with the response to placebo . DB00391 only suppressed increases in plasma cortisol levels at 180 to 240 min , compared with the response to placebo . A single dose of cetraxate had no effect on plasma DB01285 -IS and cortisol levels . Ecabet may have a modulatory effect on the Q9Y251 axis while sulpiride may have a partial modulatory effect on the Q9Y251 axis . These effects might be beneficial in stress-related disease .
