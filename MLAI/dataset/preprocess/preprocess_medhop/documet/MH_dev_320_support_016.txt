Renal changes induced by a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor during normal and low sodium intake . P35354 ( P35354 ) has been identified in renal tissues under normal conditions , with its expression enhanced during sodium restriction . To evaluate the role of P35354 -derived metabolites in the regulation of renal function , we infused a selective inhibitor ( nimesulide ) in anesthetized dogs with normal or low sodium intake . The renal effects elicited by nimesulide and a non-isozyme-specific inhibitor ( meclofenamate ) were compared during normal sodium intake . In ex vivo assays , meclofenamate , but not nimesulide , prevented the platelet aggregation elicited by arachidonic acid . During normal sodium intake , nimesulide infusion ( n=6 ) had no effects on arterial pressure or renal hemodynamics but did reduce urinary sodium excretion , urine flow rate , and fractional lithium excretion . In contrast , nimesulide administration increased arterial pressure and decreased renal blood flow , urine flow rate , and fractional lithium excretion during low sodium intake ( n=6 ) . P35354 inhibition reduced urinary prostaglandin E(2) excretion in both groups but did not modify plasma renin activity in dogs with low ( 8.1+/-1.1 ng angiotensin I. mL(-1). h(-1) ) or normal ( 1.8+/-0.4 ng angiotensin I. mL(-1). h(-1) ) sodium intake . DB00939 infusion in dogs with normal sodium intake ( n=8 ) induced a greater renal hemodynamic effect than nimesulide infusion . These results suggest that P35354 -derived metabolites ( 1 ) are involved in the regulation of sodium excretion in dogs with normal sodium intake , ( 2 ) play an important role in the regulation of renal hemodynamic and excretory function in dogs with low sodium intake , and ( 3 ) are not involved in the maintenance of the high renin levels during a long-term decrease in sodium intake .
