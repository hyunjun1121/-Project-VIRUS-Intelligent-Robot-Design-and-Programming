Synergistic proapoptotic effects of the two tyrosine kinase inhibitors pazopanib and lapatinib on multiple carcinoma cell lines . DB06589 and lapatinib are two tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been designed to inhibit the P15692 tyrosine kinase receptors 1 , 2 and 3 ( pazopanib ) , and the P00533 and P04626 receptors in a dual manner ( lapatinib ) . DB06589 has also been reported to mediate inhibitory effect on a selected panel of additional tyrosine kinases such as P09619 and c-kit . Here , we report that pazopanib and lapatinib act synergistically to induce apoptosis of A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cells . Systematic assessment of the kinome revealed that both pazopanib and lapatinib inhibited dozens of different tyrosine kinases and that their combination could suppress the activity of some tyrosine kinases ( such as c- DB00134 ) that were not or only partially affected by either of the two agents alone . We also found that pazopanib and lapatinib induced selective changes in the transcriptome of A549 cells , some of which were specific for the combination of both agents . Analysis of a panel of unrelated human carcinoma cell lines revealed a signature of 52 genes whose up- or downregulation reflected the combined action of pazopanib and lapatinib . Indeed , pazopanib and lapatinib exerted synergistic cytotoxic effects on several distinct non-small-cell lung cancer cells as well as on unrelated carcinomas . Altogether , these results support the contention that combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be evaluated for synergistic antitumor effects . Such combinations may lead to a ' collapse ' of pro-survival signal transduction pathways that leads to apoptotic cell death .
