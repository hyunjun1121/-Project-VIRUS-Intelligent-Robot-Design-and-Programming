Akt/ P31749 kinase phosphorylates separately Thr212 and Ser214 of tau protein in vitro . P10636 contains a consensus motif for protein kinase B/Akt ( Akt ) , which plays an essential role in anti-apoptotic signaling . The motif encompasses the AT100 double phospho-epitope ( Thr212/Ser214 ) , a specific marker for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and other neurodegenerations , raising the possibility that it could be generated by Akt . We studied Akt-dependent phosphorylation of tau protein in vitro . We found that Akt phosphorylated both Thr212 and Ser214 in the longest and shortest tau isoforms as determined using phospho site-specific antibodies against tau . Akt did not phosphorylate other tau epitopes , including Tau-1 , AT8 , AT180 , 12E8 and PHF-1 . The Akt-phosphorylated tau retained its initial electrophoretic mobility . Immunoprecipitation studies with phospho-specific Thr212 and Ser214 antibodies revealed that only one of the two sites is phosphorylated per single tau molecule , resulting in tau immunonegative for AT100 . Mixed kinase studies showed that prior Ser214 phosphorylation by Akt blocked protein kinase A but not GSK3beta activity . On the other hand , GSK3beta selectively blocked Ser214 phosphorylation , which was prevented by lithium . The results suggest that Akt may be involved in AD-specific phosphorylation of tau at the AT100 epitope in conjunction with other kinases . Our data suggest that phosphorylation of tau by Akt may play specific role(s) in Akt-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling , particularly relevant to AD and other neurodegenerations .
