Subcellular localization of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase ( P07902 ) catalyzes the second step of the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism , following galactokinase ( P51570 ) and preceding DB03501 -4-epimerase ( Q14376 ) . Impairment of P07902 in humans results in the potentially lethal disorder classic galactosemia . Standard lysis protocols of bacteria , yeast , or mammalian cells release all three Leloir enzymes in the soluble fraction , leading to the historical assumption that all three function as free cytosolic enzymes . We have tested this assumption with regard to P07902 in vivo using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , by linking a GFP-tag onto the amino terminus of Gal7p , the endogenous yeast P07902 . We find clear evidence of localization of the fusion protein to discrete spots in the cytoplasm of the majority of cells expressing all three Leloir enzymes , although GFP alone appears freely cytosolic . In contrast , yeast expressing GFP-Gal7p but lacking Gal1p ( P51570 ) , Gal10p ( Q14376 ) , or both do not demonstrate spots in the majority of cells , implicating a role , either direct or indirect , for these other Leloir proteins in the Gal7p localization process . Preliminary truncation experiments reveal that amino acids 1-134 of Gal7p are sufficient to drive localization of the fusion protein , while amino acids 1-66 are not . Finally , GFP-tagged human P07902 expressed in yeast also localizes to spots , demonstrating that at least some of the intrinsic determinants of localization have been conserved . These observations raise the intriguing possibility that P07902 may function in a sequestered rather than a freely diffusible state , and that this subcellular organization may have been conserved through evolution .
