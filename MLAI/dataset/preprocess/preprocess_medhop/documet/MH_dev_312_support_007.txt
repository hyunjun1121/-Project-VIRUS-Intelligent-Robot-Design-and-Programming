Whole genome SNP genotyping and exome sequencing reveal novel genetic variants and putative causative genes in congenital hyperinsulinism . Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy ( CHI ) is a rare disorder characterized by severe hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin secretion . The genetic causes of CHI have been found in genes regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic Î²-cells ; recessive inactivating mutations in the Q09428 and Q14654 genes represent the most common events . Despite the advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of CHI , specific genetic determinants in about 50 % of the CHI patients remain unknown , suggesting additional locus heterogeneity . In order to search for novel loci contributing to the pathogenesis of CHI , we combined a family-based association study , using the transmission disequilibrium test on 17 CHI patients lacking mutations in Q09428 / Q14654 , with a whole-exome sequencing analysis performed on 10 probands . This strategy allowed the identification of the potential causative mutations in genes implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion such as transmembrane proteins ( O00555 , Q9H252 , P78508 , Q04721 , Q15413 , Q9UQD0 , Q8NET8 , Q9UL62 ) , cytosolic ( O00763 , Q13557 , Q5VV42 , GNAS , NOS2 , Q08493 , Q92569 ) and mitochondrial enzymes ( PC , Q6J4K2 ) , and in four genes ( Q96PZ7 , Q8NCC5 , Q8IWU6 , O43897 ) suggested by P04053 family-based association study . Moreover , the exome-sequencing approach resulted to be an efficient diagnostic tool for CHI , allowing the identification of mutations in three causative CHI genes ( Q09428 , P00367 , and P20823 ) in four out of 10 patients . Overall , the present study should be considered as a starting point to design further investigations : our results might indeed contribute to meta-analysis studies , aimed at the identification/confirmation of novel causative or modifier genes .
