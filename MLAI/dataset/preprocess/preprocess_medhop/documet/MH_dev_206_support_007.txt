Apolipoproteins D and E3 exert neurotrophic and synaptogenic effects in dorsal root ganglion cell cultures . Co-cultures of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes with neurons from the rat dorsal root ganglia ( Q86YR7 ) showed enhanced neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis . Microarray analysis for upregulated genes in adipocyte/ Q86YR7 co-cultures currently points to apolipoproteins D and E ( P05090 , ApoE ) as influential proteins . We therefore tested adipocyte-secreted cholesterol and the carrier proteins P05090 and ApoE3 . DB04540 , P05090 , and ApoE3 each increased neurite outgrowth and upregulated the expression of presynaptic synaptophysin and synaptotagmin , as well as the postsynaptic density protein 95 . The neurotrophic effects of P05090 and ApoE3 were associated with an increased expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 . Simultaneous treatment with receptor-associated protein , an apolipoprotein receptor antagonist , inhibited the neurotrophic function of both apolipoproteins . The application of P05090 , ApoE3 , and cholesterol to Q86YR7 cell cultures corresponded with increased expression of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 ( P61073 ) . Surprisingly , the inhibition of P61073 by the antagonistic drug DB06809 decreased the apolipoprotein/cholesterol dependent neurotrophic effects . We thus assume that apolipoprotein-induced neuritogenesis in Q86YR7 cells interferes with P61073 signaling , and that adipocyte-derived apolipoproteins might be helpful in nerve repair .
