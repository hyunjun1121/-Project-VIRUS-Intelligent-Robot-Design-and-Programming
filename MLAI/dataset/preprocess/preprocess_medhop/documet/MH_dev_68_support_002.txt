Small and colorful stones make beautiful mosaics : fragment-based chemogenomics . Smaller stones with a wide variety of colors make a higher resolution mosaic . In much the same way , smaller chemical entities that are structurally diverse are better able to interrogate protein binding sites . This feature article describes the construction of a diverse fragment library and an analysis of the screening of six representative protein targets belonging to three diverse target classes ( G protein-coupled receptors P07550 , P35367 , Q9Y5N1 , and Q9H3N8 , the ligand-gated ion channel P46098 , and the kinase PKA ) using chemogenomics approaches . The integration of experimentally determined bioaffinity profiles across related and unrelated protein targets and chemogenomics analysis of fragment binding and protein structure allow the identification of : ( i ) unexpected similarities and differences in ligand binding properties , and ( ii ) subtle ligand affinity and selectivity cliffs . With a wealth of fragment screening data being generated in industry and academia , such approaches will contribute to a more detailed structural understanding of ligand-protein interactions .
