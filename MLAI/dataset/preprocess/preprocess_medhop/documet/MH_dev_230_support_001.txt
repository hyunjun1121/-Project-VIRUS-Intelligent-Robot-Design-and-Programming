Low-intensity laser irradiation at 660 nm stimulates transcription of genes involved in the electron transport chain . BACKGROUND DATA : Low-intensity laser irradiation ( LILI ) has been shown to stimulate cellular functions leading to increased adenosine triphosphate ( DB00171 ) synthesis . This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of LILI on genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain ( ETC , complexes I-IV ) and oxidative phosphorylation ( DB00171 synthase ) . METHODS : Four human skin fibroblast cell models were used in this study : normal non-irradiated cells were used as controls while wounded , diabetic wounded , and ischemic cells were irradiated . Cells were irradiated with a 660 nm diode laser with a fluence of 5 J/cm(2) and gene expression determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription ( RT ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . RESULTS : LILI upregulated cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb polypeptide 2 ( Q6YFQ2 ) , cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc ( P09669 ) , and pyrophosphatase ( inorganic ) 1 ( Q15181 ) in diabetic wounded cells ; P09669 , DB00171 synthase , H+transporting , mitochondrial Fo complex , subunit B1 ( P24539 ) , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( DB00157 ) dehydrogenase ( ubiquinone ) 1 alpha subcomplex , 11 ( Q86Y39 ) , and DB00157 dehydrogenase ( ubiquinone ) Fe- Q15517 7 ( O75251 ) in wounded cells ; and ATPase , H+/K+ exchanging , beta polypeptide ( P51164 ) , and DB00171 synthase , H+ transporting , mitochondrial Fo complex , subunit P06681 ( subunit 9 ) ( Q06055 ) in ischemic cells . CONCLUSIONS : LILI at 660 nm stimulates the upregulation of genes coding for subunits of enzymes involved in complexes I and IV and DB00171 synthase .
