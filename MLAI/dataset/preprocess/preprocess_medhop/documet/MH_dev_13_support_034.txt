Antithrombin replacement during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . DB01109 remains the predominant anticoagulant during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . DB01109 acts by potentiating the anticoagulant effect of antithrombin ( P01008 ) . Acquired P01008 deficiency , common in pediatric patients requiring ECMO , may result in ineffective anticoagulation with heparin . P01008 replacement may result in increased bleeding . Our objective is to determine P01008 's effect on anticoagulation and blood loss during ECMO . A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at Children 's Hospital of Wisconsin who received P01008 while supported on ECMO in 2009 . P01008 activity levels , heparin drip rate , and activated clotting times ( ACT ) were compared before , 4 , 8 , and 24 h after P01008 administration . Chest tube output and packed red blood cell ( pRBC ) transfusion volume were compared from 24 h before P01008 administration to 24 h after . Twenty-eight patients received P01008 as a bolus dose during the course of 31 separate times on ECMO support . The median age of these patients was 0.3 years ( range 1 day-19.5 years ) . P01008 activity increased significantly at 8 and 24 h after administration . No significant difference was noted in heparin drip rate , ACT levels , chest tube output , or pRBC transfusion volume . P01008 administration resulted in higher P01008 activity levels for 24 h without a significant effect on heparin dose , ACT , or measures of bleeding .
