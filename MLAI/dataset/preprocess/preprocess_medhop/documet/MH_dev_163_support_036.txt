Expression of transient receptor potential P13671 channels in human lung macrophages . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) is associated with pulmonary inflammation with increased numbers of macrophages located in the parenchyma . These macrophages have the capacity to mediate the underlying pathophysiology of P48444 ; therefore , a better understanding of their function in chronic inflammation associated with this disease is vital . Ion channels regulate many cellular functions ; however , their role in macrophages is unclear . This study examined the expression and function of transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels in human macrophages . Human alveolar macrophages and lung tissue macrophages expressed increased mRNA and protein for Q9Y210 when compared with monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages . Moreover , Q9Y210 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in alveolar macrophages from patients with P48444 compared with control subjects . There were no differences in mRNA for Q13507 or TRPC7 . Although mRNA for O94759 and Q8NER1 was detected in these cells , protein expression could not be determined . Fractionation of lung-derived macrophages demonstrated that Q9Y210 protein was more highly expressed by smaller macrophages compared with larger macrophages . Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology , Q9Y210 -like currents were measured in both macrophage subpopulations with appropriate biophysical and basic pharmacological profiles . These currents were active under basal conditions in the small macrophages . These data suggest that Q9Y210 -like channels are functional on human lung macrophages , and may be associated with P48444 .
