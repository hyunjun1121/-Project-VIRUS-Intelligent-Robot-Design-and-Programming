DB08885 for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . BACKGROUND : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) affects > 14 million individuals worldwide . Although 90 % of patients with AMD have the dry form , neovascular AMD accounts for the vast majority of patients who develop legal blindness . Until recently , few treatment options existed for treatment of neovascular AMD . The advent of anti- P15692 therapy has significantly improved the safe and effective treatment of neovascular AMD . In addition to two anti- P15692 drugs currently in widespread use , ranibizumab and bevacizumab , a number of medications that interrupt angiogenesis are currently under investigation . One promising new drug is aflibercept ( DB08885 ) , a fusion protein that blocks all isoforms of P15692 and placental growth factors-1 and -2 . OBJECTIVE : To review the current literature and clinical trial data regarding DB08885 for the treatment of neovascular AMD . METHODS : Literature review . RESULTS/CONCLUSION : DB08885 is a novel anti- P15692 therapy , with Phase I and II trial data indicating safety , tolerability and efficacy for the treatment of neovascular AMD . Two Phase III clinical trials ( VIEW-1 and VIEW-2 ) comparing DB08885 to ranibizumab are currently continuing and will provide vital insight into the clinical applicability of this drug .
