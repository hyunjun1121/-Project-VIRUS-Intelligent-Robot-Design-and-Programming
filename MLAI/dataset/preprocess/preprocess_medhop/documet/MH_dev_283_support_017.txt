DB00184 activates P46937 through nAChRs mediated signaling in esophageal squamous cell cancer ( ESCC ) . Cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for esophageal cancers . P46937 ( P46937 ) , the key transcription factor of the mammalian Hippo pathway , has been reported to be an oncogenic factor for many cancers . In this study , we find nicotine administration can induce nuclear translocation and activation of P46937 in ESCC . Consistently , we observed nuclear translocation and activation of P46937 by knockdown of P32297 , which is a negative regulator of nicotine signaling in bronchial and esophageal cancer cells . DB00184 administration or P32297 depletion substantially increased proliferation and migration in esophageal cancer cells . Interestingly , we find that P46937 physically interacts with nAChRs , and nAChRs-signaling dissociates P46937 from its negative regulatory complex composed with α-catenin , β-catenin and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm , leading to upregulation and nuclear translocation of P46937 . This process likely requires PKC activation , as PKC specific inhibitor Enzastaurin can block nicotine induced P46937 activation . In addition , we find nicotine signaling also inhibits the interaction of P46937 with Q9H3D4 , which contributes to the inhibitory effect of nicotine on apoptosis . Using immunohistochemistry analysis we observed upregulation of P46937 in a significant portion of esophageal cancer samples . Consistently , we have found a significant association between P46937 upregulation and cigarette smoking in the clinical esophageal cancer samples . Together , these findings suggest that the nicotine activated nAChRs signaling pathway which further activates P46937 plays an important role in the development of esophageal cancer , and this mechanism may be of a general significance for the carcinogenesis of smoking related cancers .
