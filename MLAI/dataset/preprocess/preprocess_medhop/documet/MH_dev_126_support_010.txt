Erlotinib : success of a molecularly targeted agent for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer . P00533 ( P00533 ) is overexpressed by several solid tumors , including pancreatic cancer , and has become an important target for novel anticancer pharmacotherapy . Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the P00533 tyrosine kinase . The addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine has been shown to prolong survival of patients treated for advanced pancreatic cancer in the National Cancer Institute of Canada PA.3 trial . This survival advantage is small yet noteworthy , in that numerous gemcitabine-containing combinations have failed to show a statistically significant survival advantage over gemcitabine alone . The most frequent toxicities associated with the addition of erlotinib are diarrhea and rash . Erlotinib-induced rash appears to be predictive of outcome . Further clinical studies of erlotinib in the treatment of pancreatic cancer are ongoing .
