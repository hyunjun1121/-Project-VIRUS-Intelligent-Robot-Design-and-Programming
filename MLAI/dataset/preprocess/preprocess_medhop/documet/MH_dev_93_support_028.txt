Constitutive G(i2)-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase type II by the P08908 receptor . Inhibition by anxiolytic partial agonists . The P08908 receptor is implicated in depression and anxiety . This receptor couples to G(i) proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) activity but can stimulate AC in tissues ( e.g. hippocampus ) that express ACII . The role of ACII in receptor-mediated stimulation of DB02527 formation was examined in P29320 -293 cells transfected with the P08908 receptor , which mediated inhibition of basal and G(s)-induced DB02527 formation in the absence of ACII . In cells cotransfected with P08908 receptor and ACII plasmids , P08908 agonists induced a 1 . 5-fold increase in DB02527 level . Cotransfection of P08908 receptor , ACII , and Galpha(i2) , but not Galpha(i1) , Galpha(i3) , or Galpha(o) , resulted in an agonist-independent 6-fold increase in the basal DB02527 level , suggesting that G(i2) preferentially coupled the receptor to ACII . The P28222 receptor also constitutively activated ACII . Constitutive activity of the P08908 receptor was blocked by pertussis toxin and the Gbetagamma antagonist , betaCT , suggesting an important role for Gbetagamma-mediated activation of ACII . The DB00156 -149 --> Ala mutation in the second intracellular domain of the P08908 receptor disrupted Gbetagamma-selective activation of ACII . Spontaneous P08908 receptor activity was partially attenuated by P08908 receptor partial agonists with anxiolytic activity ( e.g. buspirone and flesinoxan ) but was not altered by full agonists or antagonists . Thus , anxiolytic activity may involve inhibition of spontaneous P08908 receptor activity .
