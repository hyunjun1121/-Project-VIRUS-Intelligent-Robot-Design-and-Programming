Induction of Th17 lymphocytes and Treg cells by monocyte-derived dendritic cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) have a key role in the regulation of immune response . We herein explored , in patients with inflammatory diseases , the role of monocyte derived DC 's ( mo-DCs ) on the generation of Th17 and T regulatory ( Treg ) lymphocytes . Peripheral blood was obtained from thirty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , twelve with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , and twenty healthy subjects . Mo-DCs were generated under standard ( P05112 /GM- P04141 ) or tolerogenic ( P05112 /GM- P04141 plus recombinant P16109 or P18621 or P22301 ) conditions , and their ability to induce Th17 and Treg lymphocytes was tested . We detected that mo-DCs from patients with RA showed an enhanced release of P05231 and IL-23 as well as an increased capability to induce Th17 cells . Although mo-DCs from SLE patients also released high levels of P05231 /IL-23 , it did not show an increased ability to induce Th17 lymphocytes . In addition , mo-DCs , from patients with RA and SLE generated under the engagement of Q14242 , showed a defective capability to induce Foxp3+ Treg cells . A similar phenomenon was observed in SLE , when DC 's cells were generated under PDL-1 engagement . Our data indicate that DCs from patients with rheumatic inflammatory disease show an aberrant function that may have an important role in the pathogenesis of these conditions .
