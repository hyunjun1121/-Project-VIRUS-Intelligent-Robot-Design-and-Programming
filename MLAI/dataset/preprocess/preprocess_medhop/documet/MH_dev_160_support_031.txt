[ Use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis ] . DB00065 , a chimeric monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) antibody has dramatically changed the management of various chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis or psoriasis . This drug is well established for the treatment of CD in case of steroid-refractoriness , failure to respond to an immunosuppressant agent or fistulizing disease . The immunological concept that ulcerative colitis ( UC ) reflects primarily a T-helper cell type-2 mediated disease prevented the earlier use of anti- P01375 agents in this disease . Promising initial pilot studies in steroid-refractory UC patients led to two large placebo-controlled trials in patients with moderate to severe UC . These studies clearly showed a benefit for infliximab treatment in UC with mucosal healing and improved life quality . DB00065 therefore can be used in patients not responding adequately to steroids and/or immunosuppressants . Furthermore , one study showed evidence that infliximab might also be effective in severe , intravenous steroid-refractory UC . Therefore , infliximab might be used alternatively to cyclosporine A or tacrolimus in this patient group . DB00065 has now been established as an additional treatment option in patients with chronic-active UC not responding to an immunosuppressive agent and/or in case of severe acute UC . Experienced gastroenterologists should be involved in the decision making for such a therapy to balance thoroughly the benefit/risk ratio for our patients .
