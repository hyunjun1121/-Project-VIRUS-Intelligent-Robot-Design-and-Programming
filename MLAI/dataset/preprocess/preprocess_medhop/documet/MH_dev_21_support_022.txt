DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) are potential predictive biomarkers in early stage oral squamous cell carcinomas ( OSCC ) . Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is often associated with metastatic disease and a poor 5 year survival rate . Patients diagnosed with small tumours generally have a more favourable outcome , but some of these small tumours are aggressive and lead to early death . To avoid harmful overtreatment of patients with favourable prognosis , there is a need for predictive biomarkers that can be used for treatment stratification . In this study we assessed the possibility to use components of the plasminogen activator ( PA ) system as prognostic markers for OSCC outcome and compared this to the commonly used biomarker Ki-67 . A tissue-micro-array ( TMA ) based immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumour tissue obtained from a North Norwegian cohort of 115 patients diagnosed with OSCC was conducted . The expression of the biomarkers was compared with clinicopathological variables and disease specific death . The statistical analyses revealed that low expression of Q03405 ( p = 0.031 ) and P05121 ( p = 0.021 ) in the tumour cells was significantly associated with low disease specific death in patients with small tumours and no lymph node metastasis ( T1N0 ) . The commonly used biomarker , Ki-67 , was not associated with disease specific death in any of the groups of patients analysed . The conclusion is that Q03405 and P05121 are potential predictive biomarkers in early stage tumours and that this warrants further studies on a larger cohort of patients .
