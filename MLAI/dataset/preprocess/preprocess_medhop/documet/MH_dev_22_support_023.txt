Potential mechanisms for thrombocytopenia development with trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) . PURPOSE : DB00072 -emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) comprising the cytotoxic agent DM1 conjugated to trastuzumab with a stable linker . Thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in the phase I study , and grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia occurred in up to 13 % of patients receiving DB05773 in phase III studies . We investigated the mechanism of DB05773 -induced thrombocytopenia . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The effect of DB05773 on platelet function was measured by aggregometry , and by flow cytometry to detect the markers of activation . The effect of DB05773 on differentiation and maturation of megakaryocytes ( MK ) from human hematopoietic stem cells was assessed by flow cytometry and microscopy . Binding , uptake , and catabolism of DB05773 in MKs , were assessed by various techniques including fluorescence microscopy , scintigraphy to detect T-[H(3)]-DM1 and (125)I- DB05773 , and mass spectrometry . The role of FcγRIIa was assessed using blocking antibodies and mutant constructs of trastuzumab that do not bind FcγR . RESULTS : DB05773 had no direct effect on platelet activation and aggregation , but it did markedly inhibit MK differentiation via a cytotoxic effect . Inhibition occurred with DM1-containing ADCs but not with trastuzumab demonstrating a role for DM1 . MKs internalized these ADCs in a P04626 -independent , FcγRIIa-dependent manner , resulting in intracellular release of DM1 . Binding and internalization of DB05773 diminished as MKs matured ; however , prolonged exposure of mature MKs to DB05773 resulted in a disrupted cytoskeletal structure . CONCLUSIONS : These data support the hypothesis that DB05773 -induced thrombocytopenia is mediated in large part by DM1-induced impairment of MK differentiation , with a less pronounced effect on mature MKs .
