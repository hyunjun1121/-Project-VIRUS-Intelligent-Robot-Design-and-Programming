Potential effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activator on LPS-induced lung injury in rats . Multiple factors contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease( P48444 ) , still requiring new therapeutic strategies and medications for the disease . The aim of the present study is to investigate the model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced chronic lung injury and hyperinflation and test therapeutic effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma agonist . Wister rats were challenged with intra-tracheal instillation of LPS at concentrations of 0.006 , 0.060 , 0.600 , and 6.000 mg/ml per kg , twice a week , for 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 weeks . Q07869 activator , 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 ( 15D-PGJ2 ) , or vehicle ( PBS ) was administered orally and daily at the dose of 1 and 10 mg/ml per kg in animals challenged with LPS or PBS at the dose of 0.060 mg/ml per kg body weight twice a week for 4 weeks . We found that intra-tracheal exposure of LPS resulted in a dose-dependent pattern of chronic lung hyperinflation and hypertrophy , increased alveolar enlargement , reduced vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and elevated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( P01033 ) -1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid , and early changes of leukocyte influx and interferon ( IFN ) -gamma levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid . P37231 agonist ameliorated these changes related with the dose used.LPS-induced lung disease model shows some similarities with human disease , and P37231 agonist maybe an alternative for P48444 therapy .
