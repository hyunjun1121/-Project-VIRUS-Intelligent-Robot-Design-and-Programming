DB00013 activates macrophage Q15165 gene transcription via the PI3K/ROS/MEK/ Q12772 signalling cascade mediated by the P09619 . AIMS : We have recently shown that urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) increases oxidative stress ( OS ) , cholesterol biosynthesis , and paraoxonase 2 ( Q15165 ) expression in macrophages via binding to its receptor , the Q03405 . Since Q15165 is regulated by both OS and cholesterol content , we hypothesized that uPA elicits a cascade of signal transduction events shared by NADPH oxidase and cholesterol biosynthesis that culminates in Q15165 gene expression . Here , we investigated the signalling pathway that leads to the expression of Q15165 in macrophages in response to uPA . METHODS AND RESULTS : The increase in macrophage Q15165 mRNA levels in response to uPA was shown to depend on Q15165 gene promoter activation and mRNA transcription . LDL abolished these effects , suggesting a possible role for a transcription factor involved in cellular cholesterogenesis . Indeed , uPA upregulated Q15165 expression in a sterol regulatory binding protein-2 ( Q12772 ) -dependent manner , since blocking Q12772 maturation by 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride abolished uPA-stimulation of Q15165 , whereas inhibition of Q12772 catabolism by N-acetyl-leucyl-norleucinal had an opposite effect . The upstream signalling mechanisms include uPA activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( P27361 /2 ) , which was dependent on NADPH oxidase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation , and these latter effects were mediated by the tyrosine kinase activity of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta . CONCLUSION : These findings provide a framework linking interactions among cellular signalling pathways associated with reactive oxygen species production , macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis , and cellular Q15165 expression in vascular pathophysiology .
