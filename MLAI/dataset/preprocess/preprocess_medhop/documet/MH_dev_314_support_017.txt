Phosphatase P35813 negatively regulates P-TEFb function in resting P01730 (+) T cells and inhibits HIV-1 gene expression . BACKGROUND : Processive elongation of the integrated HIV-1 provirus is dependent on recruitment of P-TEFb by the viral Tat protein to the viral TAR RNA element . P-TEFb kinase activity requires phosphorylation of Thr186 in the T-loop of the P50750 subunit . In resting P01730 +T cells , low levels of T-loop phosphorylated P50750 are found , which increase significantly upon activation . This suggests that the phosphorylation status of the T-loop is actively regulated through the concerted actions of cellular proteins such as DB00133 / DB00156 phosphatases . We investigated the role of phosphatase P35813 in regulating P50750 T-loop phosphorylation and its effect on HIV-1 proviral transcription . RESULTS : We found that overexpression of P35813 inhibits HIV-1 gene expression during viral infection and this required P35813 catalytic function . Using an artificial CDK tethering system , we further found that P35813 inhibits P50750 , but not P49336 mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR . SiRNA depletion of P35813 in resting P01730 +T cells increased the level of P50750 T-loop phosphorylation and enhanced HIV-1 gene expression . We also observed that P35813 protein levels are relatively high in resting P01730 +T cells and are not up-regulated upon T cell activation . CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish a functional link between HIV-1 replication and modulation of P50750 T-loop phosphorylation by P35813 . P35813 represses HIV-1 gene expression by inhibiting P50750 T-loop phosphorylation , thus reducing the amount of active P-TEFb available for recruitment to the viral LTR . We also infer that P35813 enzymatic activity in resting and activated P01730 + T cells are likely regulated by as yet undefined factors .
