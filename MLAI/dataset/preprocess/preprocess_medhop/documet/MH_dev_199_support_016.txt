The chronic oral administration of arginine aspartate decreases secretion of DB01277 and P17936 in healthy volunteers . To investigate the effect of chronic oral arginine aspartate on the growth hormone ( GH ) , GH-releasing hormone ( P01286 ) , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) and IGF-binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) secretions in healthy volunteers . Twenty-three healthy non-athlete volunteer males were administered arginine aspartate ( 30 g ) orally once daily at 21:00 h for 21 consecutive days . Subjects were hospitalized on days 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 and 21 of treatment . At each hospitalization , concentrations of P01286 , GH , DB01277 and P17936 were measured over 4 h after arginine aspartate intake . GH , DB01277 and P17936 concentrations were also determined over 12 h at days 0 , 1 and 21 . Compared with day 1 , 4 h GH levels dropped at day 5 and subsequently rose to levels not significantly different from initial ones . The latter was substantiated by 12 h GH levels that did not significantly change from days 1 to 21 . P01286 levels were not statistically different , although there was a trend in median values that seemed to inversely mirror those of GH . This dynamic over the course of the study for GH and P01286 was accompanied by a general decrease in DB01277 and P17936 . In healthy volunteers , a chronic oral treatment with 30 g/day arginine aspartate is followed by a decrease in DB01277 and P17936 secretions .
