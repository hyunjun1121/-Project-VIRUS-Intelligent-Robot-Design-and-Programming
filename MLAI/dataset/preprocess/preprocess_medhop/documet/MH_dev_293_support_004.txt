Evaluation of degarelix in the management of prostate cancer . Medical castration using gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptor agonists currently provides the mainstay of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer . Although effective , these agents only reduce testosterone levels after a delay of 14 to 21 days ; they also cause an initial surge in testosterone that can stimulate the cancer and lead to exacerbation of symptoms ( " clinical flare " ) in patients with advanced disease . Phase III trial data for the recently approved P30968 blocker , degarelix , demonstrated that it is as effective and well tolerated as DB00644 agonists . However , it has a pharmacological profile more closely matching orchiectomy , with an immediate onset of action and faster testosterone and PSA suppression , without a testosterone surge or microsurges following repeated injections . As a consequence , with this DB00644 blocker , there is no risk of clinical flare and no need for concomitant antiandrogen flare protection . DB06699 therefore provides a useful addition to the hormonal armamentarium for prostate cancer and offers a valuable new treatment option for patients with hormone-sensitive advanced disease . Here , we review key preclinical and clinical data for degarelix , and look at patient-focused perspectives in the management of prostate cancer .
