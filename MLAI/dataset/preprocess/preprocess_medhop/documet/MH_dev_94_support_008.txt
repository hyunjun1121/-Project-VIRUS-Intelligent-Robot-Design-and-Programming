The expression level of P21554 and CB2 receptors determines their efficacy at inducing apoptosis in astrocytomas . BACKGROUND : Cannabinoids represent unique compounds for treating tumors , including astrocytomas . Whether CB(1) and CB(2) receptors mediate this therapeutic effect is unclear . PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : We generated astrocytoma subclones that express set levels of CB(1) and CB(2) , and found that cannabinoids induce apoptosis only in cells expressing low levels of receptors that couple to P27361 /2 . In contrast , cannabinoids do not induce apoptosis in cells expressing high levels of receptors because these now also couple to the prosurvival signal AKT . Remarkably , cannabinoids applied at high concentration induce apoptosis in all subclones independently of CB(1) , CB(2) and AKT , but still through a mechanism involving P27361 /2 . SIGNIFICANCE : The high expression level of CB(1) and CB(2) receptors commonly found in malignant astrocytomas precludes the use of cannabinoids as therapeutics , unless AKT is concomitantly inhibited , or cannabinoids are applied at concentrations that bypass CB(1) and CB(2) receptors , yet still activate P27361 /2 .
