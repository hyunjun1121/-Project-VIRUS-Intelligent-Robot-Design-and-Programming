Increase in intracellular Cl- concentration by DB02527 - and Ca2+-dependent stimulation of M1 collecting duct cells . In the lungs of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients , mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) lead to defective Cl- secretion and hyperabsorption of electrolytes . This may be a an important cause for the defective mucociliary clearance in CF lungs . Previous studies have suggested that inhibition of ENaC during activation of P13569 or by purinergic stimulation could be related to an increase in the intracellular [Cl-]i . This was examined in the present study using cultured mouse M1 collecting duct cells transfected with the chloride-sensitive enhanced yellow fluorescent protein YFP(V163S) . Calibration experiments showed a linear decrease of YFP fluorescence intensity with increasing [Cl-]i ( 0-100 mM ) . Activation of P13569 by isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ( DB07954 , 100 microM ) and forskolin ( 2 microM ) increased [Cl-]i by 9.6+/-1.5 mM ( n=35 ) . Similarly , DB00171 ( 100 microM ) increased [Cl-]i transiently by 9.5+/-2.2 mM ( n=17 ) . The increase in [Cl-]i was reduced by the Na+/K+/2 Cl- -cortransporter-1 ( P55011 ) blocker azosemide ( 100 microM ) , the P13569 blocker DB04941 ( 50 microM ) , the blocker of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels DIDS ( 100 microM ) or the ENaC blocker amiloride ( 10 microM ) . Changes in YFP(V163S) fluorescence were not due to changes in cell volume or intracellular pH . The present data thus demonstrate an increase in [Cl-]i following stimulation with secretagogues , which could participate in the inhibition of ENaC .
