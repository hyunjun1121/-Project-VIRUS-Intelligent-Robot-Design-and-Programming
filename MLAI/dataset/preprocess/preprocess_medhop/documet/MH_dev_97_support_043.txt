Neonatal estrogen exposure disrupts uterine development in the postnatal sheep . Postnatal development of the ovine uterus between birth and postnatal day ( P01160 ) 56 involves budding differentiation of the endometrial glandular epithelium from the luminal epithelium ( LE ) followed by extensive coiling and branching morphogenesis of the tubular glands . To determine the short- and long-term effects of estrogen on neonatal ovine uterine development after P01160 14 , neonatal sheep were randomly assigned at birth ( P01160 0 ) to be treated daily with estradiol-17beta benzoate ( EB ; 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , or 10 microg/kg body weight.d ) during one of two developmental periods ( P01160 14-27 or 42-55 ) . All ewes were hemiovariohysterectomized at the end of EB treatment on either P01160 28 or 56 , and the remaining uterine horn and ovary removed on P01160 112 . Immediate responses to EB treatment included dose- and age-dependent increases in uterine wet weight , thickness of the endometrium , myometrium , and LE , but decreases in endometrial glands on P01160 28 and 56 . Transient exposure to EB decreased gland number and thickness of the endometrium and LE on P01160 112 but did not affect extrauterine reproductive tract structures . The mechanism of estrogen inhibition of uterine development did not involve effects on cell proliferation . Real-time PCR analyses found that EB exposure disrupted normal patterns of growth factor ( P05019 , P01344 , fibroblast growth factor-7 , fibroblast growth factor-10 , and hepatocyte growth factor ) and receptor mRNA expression in the uterus . Transient exposure of the neonatal ewe to estrogens during critical periods specifically alters growth factor networks that perturb normal development of the uterus , leading to permanent alterations in uterine structure and function .
