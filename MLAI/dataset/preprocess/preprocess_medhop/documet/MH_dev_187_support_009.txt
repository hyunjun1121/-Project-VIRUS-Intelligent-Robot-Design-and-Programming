A P43220 agonist liraglutide inhibits endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular adhesion molecule expression in an ApoE-/- mouse model . The glucagon like peptide-1 receptor ( P43220 ) agonist liraglutide attenuates induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) and vascular adhesion molecule ( VAM ) expression in human vascular endothelial cells ( hVECs ) in vitro and may afford protection against endothelial cell dysfunction ( O95905 ) , an early abnormality in diabetic vascular disease . Our study aimed to establish the dependence of the in vitro effects of liraglutide on the P43220 and characterise its in vivo effects in a mouse model of O95905 . In vitro studies utilised the human vascular endothelial cell line P10144 - Q8IWL8 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) for determination of P05121 and VAM expression . In vivo studies of vascular reactivity and immunohistochemical analysis were performed in the ApoE(-/-) mouse model . In vitro studies demonstrated P43220 -dependent liraglutide-mediated inhibition of stimulated P05121 and VAM expression . In vivo studies demonstrated significant improvement in endothelial function in liraglutide treated mice , a P43220 dependent effect . DB06655 treatment also increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and reduced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) expression in aortic endothelium , an effect again dependent on the P43220 . Together these studies identify in vivo protection , by the P43220 agonist liraglutide , against O95905 and provide a potential molecular mechanism responsible for these effects .
