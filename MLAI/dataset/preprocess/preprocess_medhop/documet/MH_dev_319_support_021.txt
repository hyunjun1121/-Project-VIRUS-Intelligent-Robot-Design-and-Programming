P15121 inhibitor fidarestat attenuates leukocyte-endothelial interactions in experimental diabetic rat retina in vivo . PURPOSE : Dysregulation of the polyol pathway has been implicated as a major cause of diabetic retinopathy . The aldose reductase inhibitor fidarestat was recently reported to prevent retinal oxidative stress and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) protein in diabetic rats . In this study , we investigated the effect of fidarestat on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in an in vivo experimental model for diabetic retina . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Diabetes was induced in six-week-old male Long-Evans rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) ( 75 mg/kg ) . The rats were divided into four experimental groups : non-diabetic control rats , untreated diabetic rats , and diabetic rats treated with a low ( 4 mg/kg/day ) or high ( 16 mg/kg/day ) oral dose of fidarestat . After four weeks of treatment , accumulated leukocytes in the retina were counted in vivo by acridine orange digital fluorography . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and P15692 -164 mRNA levels in the retina were analyzed using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . P05362 protein expression in the retina was investigated by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : DB02021 treatment significantly decreased concentrations of sorbitol and fructose in the retinas of Q11206 -induced diabetic rats . Leukocyte accumulation in the retinas of fidarestat-treated rats was significantly less than in the untreated diabetic group ( P < 0.01 ) . DB02021 treatment significantly reduced the expression P05362 mRNA , but not P15692 -164 mRNA , in the retina of diabetic rats . Immunohistochemical study also revealed the suppressive effect of fidarestat on expression of P05362 . CONCLUSIONS : Oral administration of fidarestat attenuated leukocyte accumulation in the retina of Q11206 induced-diabetic rats , suggesting that fidarestat may have a therapeutic role in preventing the progression of diabetic retinopathy .
