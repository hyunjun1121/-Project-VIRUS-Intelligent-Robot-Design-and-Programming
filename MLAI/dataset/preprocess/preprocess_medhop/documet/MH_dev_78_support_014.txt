Green tea polyphenols in the prevention of colon cancer . Several plant-based nutrients and non-nutrients that can inhibit mutagenesis and proliferation have been identified . Some of the most promising nutrients identified as chemopreventive agents in colon cancer prevention include isoflavones , curcumin , calcium , vitamin D and more recently Green tea polyphenols ( GTP ) . In addition to inhibiting mutagenesis and proliferation , these compounds are relatively non-toxic , are of low cost and can be taken orally or as a part of the daily diet . Epidemiological and laboratory studies have identified epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) in green tea polyphenols ( GTP ) , as the most potent chemopreventive agent that can induce apoptosis , suppress the formation and growth of human cancers including colorectal cancers ( CRC ) . It is only logical then , that future clinical studies should focus on examining the efficacy of phytochemicals such as EGCG in cancer chemoprevention as an alternative to pharmacological agents , especially in populations where administration of P35354 inhibitors , DB00945 and NSAIDS is contraindicated . The goal of this review is to provide the rationale , and discuss the use of EGCG in GTP as a chemopreventive agent for prevention of colon carcinogenesis and present evidence for the efficacy and safety of these agents based on epidemiological , animal , in vitro studies and Phase I clinical trials .
