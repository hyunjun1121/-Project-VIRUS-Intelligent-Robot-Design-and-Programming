Preserved cognition in patients with early Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment during treatment with rosiglitazone : a preliminary study . OBJECTIVE : P01308 resistance ( impaired insulin action ) has been associated with Alzheimer disease ( AD ) and memory impairment , independent of AD . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) agonists improve insulin sensitivity and regulate in-vitro processing of the amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) . Authors evaluated the effects of the P37231 agonist rosiglitazone on cognition and plasma levels of the P05067 derivative beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) in humans . METHODS : In a placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group pilot study , 30 subjects with mild AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment were randomized to a 6-month course of rosiglitazone ( 4 mg daily ; N = 20 ) or placebo ( N = 10 ) . Primary endpoints were cognitive performance and plasma Abeta levels . RESULTS : Relative to the placebo group , subjects receiving rosiglitazone exhibited better delayed recall ( at Months 4 and 6 ) and selective attention ( Month 6 ) . At Month 6 , plasma Abeta levels were unchanged from baseline for subjects receiving rosiglitazone but declined for subjects receiving placebo , consistent with recent reports that plasma Abeta42 decreases with progression of AD . CONCLUSIONS : Findings provide preliminary support that rosiglitazone may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD . Future confirmation in a larger study is needed to fully demonstrate rosiglitazone 's therapeutic potential .
