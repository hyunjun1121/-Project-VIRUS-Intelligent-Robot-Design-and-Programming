Therapeutic effects of sunitinib , one of the anti-angiogenetic drugs , in a murine arthritis . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this study was to confirm the inhibitory effects of sunitinib , an angiogenesis inhibitor that targets tyrosine kinases of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) family and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) family , on arthritis in mice with type II collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) . METHODS : DB01268 at a concentration of 30 or 60 mg/kg/day was intraperitoneally administered to mice with CIA . We compared the changes in arthritis score over time , pathological score , bone density , and microvascular density in synovial membrane between the vehicle and treatment groups . RESULTS : In the sunitinib-treated groups , the arthritis score decreased in a dose-dependent manner in comparison with that in the vehicle group . Furthermore , improvement in the pathological score , inhibitory tendency of loss in the bone density , and a decrease in the synovial microvascular density were also observed in the sunitinib-treated groups . CONCLUSIONS : DB01268 remarkably inhibited arthritis , particularly synovial angiogenesis in a murine CIA model . This compound may be useful for treating arthritis .
