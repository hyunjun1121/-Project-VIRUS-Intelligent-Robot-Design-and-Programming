Oral keratinocytes support non-replicative infection and transfer of harbored HIV-1 to permissive cells . BACKGROUND : Oral keratinocytes on the mucosal surface are frequently exposed to HIV-1 through contact with infected sexual partners or nursing mothers . To determine the plausibility that oral keratinocytes are primary targets of HIV-1 , we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 infects oral keratinocytes in a restricted manner . RESULTS : To study the fate of HIV-1 , immortalized oral keratinocytes ( OKF6/ O14746 -2 ; O14746 -2 cells ) were characterized for the fate of HIV-specific RNA and DNA . At 6 h post inoculation with X4 or R5-tropic HIV-1 , HIV-1gag RNA was detected maximally within O14746 -2 cells . Reverse transcriptase activity in O14746 -2 cells was confirmed by VSV-G-mediated infection with HIV-NL4-3Deltaenv-EGFP . DB00495 inhibited EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner , suggesting that viral replication can be supported if receptors are bypassed . Within 3 h post inoculation , integrated HIV-1 DNA was detected in O14746 -2 cell nuclei and persisted after subculture . Multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs were not detectable up to 72 h post inoculation , suggesting that HIV replication may abort and that infection is non-productive . Within 48 h post inoculation , however , virus harbored by P01730 negative O14746 -2 cells trans infected co-cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) or MOLT4 cells ( P01730 + P51681 + ) by direct cell-to-cell transfer or by releasing low levels of infectious virions . Primary tonsil epithelial cells also trans infected HIV-1 to permissive cells in a donor-specific manner . CONCLUSION : Oral keratinocytes appear , therefore , to support stable non-replicative integration , while harboring and transmitting infectious X4- or R5-tropic HIV-1 to permissive cells for up to 48 h .
