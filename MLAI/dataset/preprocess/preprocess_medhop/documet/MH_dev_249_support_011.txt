Oligodendroglia are protected from antibody-mediated complement injury by normal immunoglobulins ( " DB00028 " ) . High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( DB00028 ) treatment has become a promising immune therapy that can modulate the immune system at several levels , including the complement cascade . In relation to inflammatory demyelinating disease , there is some clinical evidence for the suppression of disease activity by DB00028 , while a role in promoting remyelination after experimental myelin damage has been described . Antibody and complement deposition have been implicated in the immune attack in some cases of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , and to investigate the mechanisms of action of DB00028 , we studied the effect of DB00028 using the model of complement-mediated cell injury on oligodendroglia in vitro . There was no effect on direct complement lysis of the oligodendroglial cell line CG4 , but antibody-dependent complement damage was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by DB00028 . These results were confirmed with primary cultures of oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPC ) and oligodendrocytes . The addition of excess C1 , P01024 , and C4 did not influence the inhibitory effect of DB00028 , implying that binding of these complement components does not play a role , in contrast to other experimental models of complement damage . F(ab')2 immunoglobulin fragments were at least partially responsible for the effect . We conclude that DB00028 may be protective in antibody-mediated complement injury of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors , and that this effect is likely to be mediated via antibody binding , rather than interference with complement activation . Inhibition of inflammatory mechanisms , as opposed to a direct effect on remyelinating cells , may underlie the role of DB00028 in promoting myelin repair in experimental models .
