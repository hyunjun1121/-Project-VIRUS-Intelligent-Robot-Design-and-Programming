Phase 2 trial of single agent DB06186 ( anti- P16410 ) for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . New , effective therapies are needed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . DB06186 can mediate an immunologic tumor regression in other histologies . This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of DB06186 for advanced pancreatic cancer . Subjects were adults with locally advanced or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma with measurable disease , good performance status , and minimal comorbidities . DB06186 was administered intravenously ( 3.0 mg/kg every 3 wk ; 4 doses/course ) for a maximum of 2 courses . Response rate by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria and toxicity were measured . Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled ( metastatic disease : 20 and locally advanced : 7 ) with median age of 55 years ( 27 to 68 y ) and good performance status ( 26 with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status =0 to 1 ) . Three subjects experienced â‰¥ grade 3 immune-mediated adverse events ( colitis:1 , encephalitis:1 , hypohysitis:1 ) . There were no responders by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria but a subject experienced a delayed response after initial progressive disease . In this subject , new metastases after 2 doses of DB06186 established progressive disease . But continued administration of the agent per protocol resulted in significant delayed regression of the primary lesion and 20 hepatic metastases . This was reflected in tumor markers normalization , and clinically significant improvement of performance status . Single agent DB06186 at 3.0 mg/kg/dose is ineffective for the treatment of advanced pancreas cancer . However , a significant delayed response in one subject of this trial suggests that immunotherapeutic approaches to pancreas cancer deserve further exploration .
