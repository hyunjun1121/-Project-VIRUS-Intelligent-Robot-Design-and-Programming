P09874 deficiency blocks P05113 expression through calpain-dependent degradation of P35610 -6 in a murine asthma model . BACKGROUND : We recently showed that poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) may play a role in allergen (ovalbumin)-induced airway eosinophilia , potentially through a specific effect on P05113 production . We also reported that while P05113 replenishment promotes reversal of eosinophilia in lungs of P09874 (-/-) mice , P05112 or Immunoglobulin E replenishment do not , suggesting a potentially significant regulatory relationship between P09874 and P05113 . OBJECTIVE : To explore the mechanism by which P09874 regulates P05113 production and to determine how P09874 inhibition blocks allergen-induced eosinophilia . METHODS : This study was conducted using a murine model of allergic airway inflammation and primary splenocytes . RESULTS : P09874 knockout-associated reduction in P05113 upon allergen exposure occurs at the mRNA level . Such an effect appears to take place after P05112 receptor activation as P09874 inhibition exerted no effect on P23458 / P52333 activation . Signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 ( P35610 -6 ) protein was severely downregulated in spleens of P09874 (-/-) mice without any effect on mRNA levels , suggesting an effect on protein integrity rather than gene transcription . Interestingly , the degradation of P35610 -6 in P09874 (-/-) mice required allergen stimulation . Additionally , P09874 enzymatic activity appears to be required for P35610 -6 integrity . The downregulation of P35610 -6 coincided with mRNA and protein reduction of GATA-binding protein-3 and occupancy of its binding site on the P05113 gene promoter . P05112 was sufficient to induce P35610 -6 downregulation in both P09874 (-/-) mice and isolated splenocytes . Such degradation may be mediated by calpain , but not by proteasomes . CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate a novel function of P09874 in regulating P05113 expression during allergen-induced inflammation and explain the underlying mechanism by which P09874 inhibition results in P05113 reduction .
