Molecular recognition of docosahexaenoic acid by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and retinoid-X receptor alpha . The family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) is the molecular target of synthetic antidiabetic and hypolipidemic drugs . The side effects of these drugs are limiting their use in patients with high lipid levels . Natural compounds , like Docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) from fish oil , have beneficial effects in the treatment of metabolic diseases , and several DB01708 derivatives are known to activate Q07869 genes . Experimental studies on affinities of DB01708 and its derivatives for PPARs are not available . In the present study we are therefore using computational docking , molecular dynamics simulation , and several scoring programs to predict affinities and binding modes of DB01708 for PPARs and retinoid-X receptor alpha , which is the DNA binding partner of PPARs . The calculations indicated that DB01708 binds to PPARs and the retinoid-X receptor alpha with high affinity , and that different PPARs exhibited different structural effects on the first four carbons atoms of DB01708 . Our data indicate that the beneficial health effects of DB01708 may be obtained by high affinity binding to the PPARs .
