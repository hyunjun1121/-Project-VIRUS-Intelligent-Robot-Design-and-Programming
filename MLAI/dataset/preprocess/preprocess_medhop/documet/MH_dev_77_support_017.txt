Crystal structure of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin protease in a product-bound state : Evidence for noncanonical zinc protease activity . Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) , the most potent toxins known , disrupt neurotransmission through proteolysis of proteins involved in neuroexocytosis . The light chains of BoNTs are unique zinc proteases that have stringent substrate specificity and require exceptionally long substrates . We have determined the crystal structure of the protease domain from BoNT serotype A ( DB00083 ) . The structure reveals a homodimer in a product-bound state , with loop F242-V257 from each monomer deeply buried in its partner 's catalytic site . The loop , which acts as a substrate , is oriented in reverse of the canonical direction for other zinc proteases . The Y249-Y250 peptide bond of the substrate loop is hydrolyzed , leaving the Y249 product carboxylate coordinated to the catalytic zinc . From the crystal structure of the DB00083 protease , detailed models of noncanonical binding and proteolysis can be derived which we propose are also consistent with DB00083 binding and proteolysis of natural substrate synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa ( P60880 ) . The proposed DB00083 substrate-binding mode and catalytic mechanism are markedly different from those previously proposed for the BoNT serotype B .
