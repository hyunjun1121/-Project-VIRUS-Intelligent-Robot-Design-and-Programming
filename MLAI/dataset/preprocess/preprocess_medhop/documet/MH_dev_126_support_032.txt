Interferon-alpha promotes the anti-proliferative effect of Erlotinib ( DB00530 ) on human colon cancer cell lines . Interferon-alpha ( IFNalpha ) treatment is associated with up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 / P00533 ) expression and marked growth inhibition while maintaining the sensitivity of the target colon cancer cells to epidermal growth factor ( Gut 2004;53:123 ) . We aimed to determine the effect of combining IFNalpha and Erlotinib ( an P00533 / P00533 inhibitor ) on colon cancer cell line growth . Crystal-violet staining and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation and expression of P00533 / P00533 . IFNalpha pre-treatment followed by a combination of IFNalpha plus Erlotinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity of 7/9 of colon cancer cell lines by 7-43 % . This approach may have clinical implications for improving treatment based on targeting of P00533 / P00533 .
