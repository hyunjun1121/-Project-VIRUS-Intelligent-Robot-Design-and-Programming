Colocalization of cannabinoid receptor 1 with somatostatin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in rat brain hypothalamus . Despite several overlapping functions of cannabinoid receptor 1 ( P21554 receptor ) , somatostatin ( P61278 ) , and neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( P29475 ) in the hypothalamus , nothing is currently known whether P21554 receptor-positive neurons coexpress P61278 and P29475 . In the present study , we describe the colocalization of P21554 receptor with P61278 and P29475 in the rat brain hypothalamus . In the hypothalamus , the distributional patterns and colocalization of P21554 receptor with P61278 and P29475 were selective and region specific . P21554 receptor and P61278 exhibited comparable colocalization ( < 60 % ) in paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) and periventricular nucleus ( PeVN ) , followed by 20 % colocalization in ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus ( VMH ) . Neurons showing colocalization between P21554 receptor and P29475 in PeVN constituted > 80 % , followed by 60 and 30 % in PVN and VMH , respectively . In contrast , P61278 - and P29475 -positive neurons displayed comparable colocalization ( > 55 % ) in PeVN and VMH , followed by PVN ( ~20 % ) . In the median eminence , P21554 receptor- , P61278 - , and P29475 -like immunoreactivity was mostly confined to the nerve fibers . The morphological colocalization of P21554 receptor with P61278 and P29475 shed new light on the understanding of their roles in regulation of physiological and pharmacological response to certain stimuli in hypothalamic nuclei specifically in food intake and energy balance .
