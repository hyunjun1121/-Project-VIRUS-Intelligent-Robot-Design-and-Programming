ADP receptors -- targets for developing antithrombotic agents . Platelet P2 receptors -- P47900 , Q9H244 , and P51575 -- constitute the means by which adenine nucleotides can activate platelets . Coactivation of the Galphaq-coupled P47900 and Galphai2-coupled Q9H244 receptors is necessary for ADP-mediated platelet activation , which forms the basis of using P2 antagonists as antithrombotic drugs . P47900 receptor antagonists inhibit platelet activation , while P47900 knockout mice show longer bleeding times than normal mice but few other problems ; however , its ubiquitous expression in other tissues renders P47900 questionable as an antithrombotic target . The Q9H244 receptor is expressed nearly exclusively in platelets and brain , making it an attractive antithrombotic target . Antagonists for the Q9H244 receptor have been developed that either require metabolic activation to covalently inhibit Q9H244 and are irreversible , or simply are competitive in nature and thus reversible . DB00208 and clopidogrel are irreversible Q9H244 antagonists and have been repeatedly proven as clinical antithrombotic agents . In addition , a recently reported Q9H244 antagonist , CS-747 , shows promise as a future antithrombotic drug . The AR-C series of compounds represent reversible Q9H244 antagonists and have been used extensively to characterize the function of Q9H244 in platelets . Clinical studies show that AR-C69931MX is as effective as clopidogrel ; furthermore , the combination of AR-C69931MX ( cangrelor ) and clopidogrel confers greater antagonism of Q9H244 than either antagonist alone . The P51575 receptor is a calcium channel that functions to potentiate agonist-induced platelet shape change , and its inhibition or loss has little if any effect on hemostasis . A combination of P47900 and Q9H244 antagonists may represent an additional course of antithrombotic treatment .
