DB01393 restores the inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicular development and steroidogenesis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma pathway in an in vitro mouse preantral follicle culture . We recently reported that bezafibrate , a lipid-lowering drug of the fibrate class , administered in addition to clomiphene citrate ( CC ) successfully induced ovulation in CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) patients . We hypothesized that bezafibrate may directly affect ovarian follicle development . P01308 resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are important for the pathogenesis of PCOS . In this study , we first examined the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , which plays a role in insulin resistance , on follicle development by using the follicle culture system . P01375 significantly inhibited follicle-stimulating hormone ( DB00094 ) -induced follicle development , 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) secretion , and ovulation rate in a dose-dependent manner . We then examined whether bezafibrate treatment could rescue the inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 . DB01393 treatment rescued inhibition of follicle development , secretion of E2 , and ovulation rate by P01375 . We examined the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) subtypes in mouse preantral follicles . As the protein expression of only P37231 was observed in mouse preantral follicles , we examined whether bezafibrate could affect follicle development and steroidogenesis through P37231 pathways . Treatment with GW1929 , a selective P37231 agonist , restored inhibition of DB00094 -induced follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 , whereas treatment with GW9662 , a selective P37231 antagonist , canceled the restorative effects of bezafibrate . Collectively , the results in this study suggest that bezafibrate may directly exhibit a restorative effect on the inhibition of ovarian follicle development and steroidogenesis by P01375 through the P37231 pathway .
