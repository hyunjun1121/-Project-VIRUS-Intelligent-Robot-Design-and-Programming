Antiaging gene Q9UEF7 regulates endothelin-1 levels and endothelin receptor subtype B expression in kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats . OBJECTIVE : Q9UEF7 is an antiaging gene and is predominately expressed in kidneys . The endothelin system is critical in the regulation of kidney function . The objective of this study is to assess whether klotho affects the renal endothelin system in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRs ) . METHOD : Four groups of male SHRs and one group of male Wistar-Kyoto ( WKY ) rats were used . In-vivo expression of klotho was achieved by AAV2 delivery of mouse klotho full-length cDNA ( AAV.mKL ) . Four groups of SHRs were given ( intravenously ) AAV.mKL , AAV.LacZ , AAV.GFP , and phosphate-buffered saline , respectively . The WKY group was given phosphate-buffered saline and served as a control . At the end of week 12 after gene delivery , all animals were euthanized . RESULTS : Plasma endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) and renal ET-1 levels were increased in SHRs vs. WKY rats . In-vivo expression of klotho reversed the elevated ET-1 levels in SHRs . ETB receptor protein expression was decreased in both kidney cortex and medulla of SHRs . Interestingly , in-vivo expression of klotho abolished the downregulation of ETB protein expression in SHRs , suggesting that klotho regulates ETB receptor expression . Q9UEF7 gene delivery also eliminated the increase in the ratio of P25101 /ETB in SHRs . Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD ) protein expression was decreased in kidneys of SHRs , which was rescued by in-vivo expression of klotho . CONCLUSION : Q9UEF7 gene delivery abolished the upregulation of ET-1 levels and the downregulation of ETB and Mn-SOD expression in kidneys of SHRs . These findings revealed a previously unidentified role of klotho in the regulation of the renal ET system and Mn-SOD in SHRs .
