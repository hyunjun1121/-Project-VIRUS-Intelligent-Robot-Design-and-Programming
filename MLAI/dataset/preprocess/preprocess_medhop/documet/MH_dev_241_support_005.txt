Paullones are potent inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 . Paullones constitute a new family of benzazepinones with promising antitumoral properties . They were recently described as potent , DB00171 -competitive , inhibitors of the cell cycle regulating cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) . We here report that paullones also act as very potent inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta ( GSK-3beta ) ( IC50 : 4-80 nM ) and the neuronal Q00535 /p25 ( IC50 : 20-200 nM ) . These two enzymes are responsible for most of the hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau , a feature observed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease and other neurodegenerative ' taupathies ' . DB04014 , the most active paullone , was demonstrated to act by competing with DB00171 for binding to GSK-3beta . DB04014 inhibits the phosphorylation of tau in vivo at sites which are typically phosphorylated by GSK-3beta in Alzheimer 's disease . DB04014 also inhibits the Q00535 /p25-dependent phosphorylation of Q9UD71 in mouse striatum slices in vitro . This dual specificity of paullones may turn these compounds into very useful tools for the study and possibly treatment of neurodegenerative and proliferative disorders .
