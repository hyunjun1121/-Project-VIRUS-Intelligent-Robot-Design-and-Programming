Monoclonal antibodies targeting P01584 reduce biomarkers of atherosclerosis in vitro and inhibit atherosclerotic plaque formation in P02649 -deficient mice . OBJECTIVE : Atherosclerosis is a condition that is increasingly contributing to worldwide mortality through complications such as stroke and myocardial infarction . IL-1β plays multiple direct , local roles in the formation and stability of the atheroma by eliciting the production of additional cytokines and proteolytic enzymes from macrophages , endothelial cells ( EC ) and smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) . We therefore tested whether an anti-IL-1β antibody , DB06062 , might inhibit the secretion of pro-atherogenic cytokines from macrophages in vitro and affect a positive outcome in the P02649 -deficient mouse ( ApoE(-/-) ) model of atherosclerosis in vivo . METHODS AND RESULTS : In an in vitro co-culture model , DB06062 inhibited macrophage-induced secretion of key atherogenic cytokines from EC and SMC , including P05231 , P10145 , P13500 and TNFα . The release of degradative enzymes , such as the matrix metalloproteinases P08254 and P14780 , was also decreased by DB06062 . In addition , DB06062 inhibited the secretion of P13232 from EC and P05112 from SMC , cytokines not previously reported to be driven by IL-1β in this context . In vivo , XMA052 MG1K , a chimeric murine version of DB06062 , inhibited the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the ApoE(-/-) model at all three doses tested . This effect was comparable to that reported for complete genetic ablation of IL-1β or IL-1R1 on an ApoE(-/-) background and was associated with decreases in plasma non-HDL/HDL cholesterol ratio and plaque lipid content and macrophage infiltration . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate for the first time that an antibody targeting IL-1β can inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in vivo , highlighting the importance of this key cytokine in cardiovascular disease .
