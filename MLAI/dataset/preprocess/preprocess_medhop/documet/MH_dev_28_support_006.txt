Vasopeptidase-activated latent ligands of the histamine receptor-1 . Whether peptidases present in vascular cells can activate prodrugs active on vascular cells has been tested with 2 potential latent ligands of the histamine H1 receptor ( P35367 ) . First , a peptide consisting of the antihistamine cetirizine ( CTZ ) condensed at the N-terminus of ε-aminocaproyl-bradykinin ( εACA-BK ) was evaluated for an antihistamine activity that could be revealed by degradation of the peptide part of the molecule . CTZ-εACA-BK had a submicromolar affinity for the BK B2 receptor ( P30411 ; IC50 of 590 nM , [(3)H]BK binding competition ) , but a non-negligible affinity for the human H1 receptor ( P35367 ; IC50 of 11 μM for [(3)H] DB06691 binding ) . In the human isolated umbilical vein , a system where both endogenous P30411 and P35367 mediate strong contractions , CTZ-εACA-BK exerted mild antagonist effects on histamine-induced contraction that were not modified by omapatrilat or by a P30411 antagonist that prevents endocytosis of the BK conjugate . Cells expressing recombinant P12821 or P30411 incubated with CTZ-εACA-BK did not release a competitor of [(3)H] DB06691 binding to H1Rs . Thus , there is no evidence that CTZ-εACA-BK can release free cetirizine in biological environments . The second prodrug was a blocked agonist , L-alanyl-histamine , potentially activated by aminopeptidase N ( P15144 ) . This compound did not compete for [(3)H] DB06691 binding to H1Rs . The human umbilical vein contractility assay responded to L-alanyl-histamine ( EC50 54.7 μM ) , but the P15144 inhibitor amastatin massively ( 17-fold ) reduced its apparent potency . Amastatin did not influence the potency of histamine as a contractile agent . One of the 2 tested latent P35367 ligands , L-alanyl-histamine , supported the feasibility of pro-drug activation by vascular ectopeptidases .
