Dysfunction of the P19957 kinase/Rap1/integrin α(IIb)β(3) pathway underlies ex vivo platelet hypoactivity in essential thrombocythemia . Patients with myeloproliferative disorders ( MPDs ) , such as essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) have increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding , which are major sources of morbidity and mortality . Most P53602 patients have a gain of function mutation in O60674 ( JAK2V617F ) , but little is known how JAK2V617F affects platelet function . Here , we demonstrate that platelets from ET patients have impaired SFLLRN-mediated fibrinogen binding and have lost the potentiating effect of thrombopoietin ( which couples to O60674 ) on this pathway . In contrast , SFLLRN-mediated P16109 expression , DB00171 secretion , phosphorylation of the PKC substrate pleckstrin , and Ca(2+) mobilization were unaffected in JAK2V617F positive platelets . In addition , thrombopoietin-mediated O60674 phosphorylation was unchanged , suggesting that signaling pathways activated downstream of O60674 are impaired . Indeed , we found that platelets from JAK2V617F positive ET patients have significantly reduced phosphorylation of the P19957 kinase substrate Akt , and have reduced activation of Rap1 in response to thrombopoietin , DB01277 ,ADP , SFLLRN , and thrombin . This effect was independent of Giα Q9H244 purinergic receptor function as ADP-mediated inhibition of P50552 phosphorylation was unchanged . These results demonstrate that the P19957 kinase/Rap1 pathway is intrinsically impaired in platelets from JAK2V617F-positive ET patients , resulting in diminished thrombin and thrombopoietin-mediated integrin α(IIb)β(3) activation .
