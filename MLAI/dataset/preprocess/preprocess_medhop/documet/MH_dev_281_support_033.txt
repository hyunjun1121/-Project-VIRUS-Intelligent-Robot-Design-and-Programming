Genetics of Alzheimer 's disease . A rapidly evolving field . Genetic factors have a variable impact on Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) , ranging from familial forms that are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion to sporadic AD , where a polygenic component is present . Most genes conferring susceptibility to AD are related to amyloid-beta deposition ( P05067 ; P49768 ; PS2 ; P02649 ; P01034 ; ubiquilin-1 ) , oxidative stress ( NOS2 ; NOS3 ) and inflammatory response ( P01583 ; P01584 ; P05231 ; P01375 ) . Genome-wide analyses , transcriptomics and proteomics approaches have pointed also to proapoptotic genes as increasing AD liability . Depression and psychotic symptoms that occur in a large proportion of AD patients have been associated with monoamine genes coding for metabolic enzymes ( P21964 ) , transporters ( 5-HTTLPR ) and receptors ( P21728 ; P35462 ) . Genetic testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis of AD in individuals with clinical signs of dementia , while it is generally not recommended as a predictive testing for AD in asymptomatic individuals . Drugs currently in use to treat AD are effective in only 20 % of patients ; their therapeutic effect is predominantly under genetic control ( O43174 gene ; P02649 ) . Environmental factors have been shown to moderate the effects of genes on psychiatric disorders such as depression , schizophrenia and ADHD . The study of gene-environment interactions in AD , that are still poorly understood , is essential to predict disease-risk in asymptomatic individuals . Genomics will provide a dynamic picture of biological processes in AD and new targets for the forthcoming anti-AD drugs .
