P10275 signals regulate UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in the urinary bladder : a potential mechanism of androgen-induced bladder carcinogenesis . UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) , major phase II drug metabolism enzymes , play an important role in urinary bladder cancer initiation by detoxifying carcinogens . We aimed to determine if androgens regulate P78381 expression via the androgen receptor ( AR ) pathway in the bladder . Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were used to assess P22309 levels in the normal urothelium SVHUC cell line stably expressed with AR and in bladder tissues from AR knockout ( ARKO ) and castrated male mice . Immunohistochemistry was also performed in radical cystectomy specimens . DB02901 ( DB02901 ) treatment in SVHUC-AR reduced mRNA expression of all the P22309 subtypes ( 19-75 % decrease ) , and hydroxyflutamide antagonized the DB02901 effects . In contrast , DB02901 showed only marginal effects on P22309 expression in SVHUC-Vector . Of note were higher expression levels of UGT1As in SVHUC-Vector than in SVHUC-AR . In ARKO mice , all the Ugt1a subtypes were up-regulated , compared to wild-type littermates . In wild-type male mice , castration increased the expression of Ugt1a8 , Ugt1a9 , and Ugt1a10 . Additionally , wild-type female mice had higher levels of Ugt1a than wild-type males . Immunohistochemical studies showed strong ( 3+ ) P22309 staining in 11/24 ( 46 % ) cancer tissues , which was significantly lower than in corresponding benign tissues [ 17/18 ( 94 % ) cases ( P = 0.0009 ) ] . These results suggest that androgen-mediated AR signals promote bladder carcinogenesis by down-regulating the expression of UGTs in the bladder .
