Q96RJ3 deficiency reduces the development of atherosclerosis in mice -- brief report . OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to assess the role of B-cell activating factor ( Q9Y275 ) receptor in B-cell regulation of atherosclerosis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Male P01130 -deficient mice ( Ldlr(-/-) ) were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with either wild type or Q96RJ3 ( Q96RJ3 ) -deficient bone marrow . After 4 weeks of recovery , mice were put on a high-fat diet for 6 or 8 weeks . Q96RJ3 deficiency in bone marrow cells led to a marked reduction of conventional mature B2 cells but did not affect the B1a cell subtype . This was associated with a significant reduction of dendritic cell activation and T-cell proliferation along with a reduction of IgG antibodies against malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein . In contrast , serum IgM type antibodies were preserved . Interestingly , Q96RJ3 deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion development and reduced numbers of plaque T cells . Selective Q96RJ3 deficiency on B cells led to a similar reduction in lesion size and T-cell infiltration but in contrast did not affect dendritic cell activation . CONCLUSIONS : Q96RJ3 deficiency in mice selectively alters mature B2 cell-dependent cellular and humoral immune responses and limits the development of atherosclerosis .
