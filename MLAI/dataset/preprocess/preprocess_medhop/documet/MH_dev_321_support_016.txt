Glucocorticoids regulate calcineurin-dependent trans-activating pathways for interleukin-2 gene transcription in human T lymphocytes . Glucocorticoids ( GC ) inhibit P60568 gene transcription by interfering with the binding of the nuclear factor activator protein-1 on the P60568 promoter . Calcineurin , a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , is an essential component of the T cell antigen receptor signal transduction pathway leading to P60568 gene transcription . Therefore , we have asked whether this phosphatase may also be regulated by GC . Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with plasmids containing the intact P60568 promoter or its NF-AT and P14859 motifs , and a deletion mutant ( delta P62158 -AI ) of calcineurin known to have Ca(2+)-independent constitutive phosphatase activity . Cotransfection of P60568 promoter with delta P62158 -AI allowed the activation of P60568 promoter in the presence of phorbol ester alone . Under these conditions dexamethasone ( DB00514 ; 10(-6) M ) inhibited P60568 promoter activation by 50-60 % . The inhibitory effect of DB00514 was specific , as demonstrated by experiments using an unrelated promoter ( simian virus 40 ) and estradiol . Furthermore , it was completely reversed in the presence of excess amounts of the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 , which suggests that it is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor . Overexpression of calcineurin via delta P62158 -AI in Jurkat cells decreased their apparent sensitivity to DB00514 ( approximately 5-fold increase in IC50 ) . Similar results were obtained with the NF-AT and P14859 constructs , which are also known to be activated by calcineurin . Thus , in addition to their known inhibitory effects on activator protein-1 , GC also inhibit calcineurin-dependent pathways for T cell activation .
