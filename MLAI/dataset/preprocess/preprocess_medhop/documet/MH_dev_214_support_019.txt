Cell-specific regulation of acetylcholinesterase expression under inflammatory conditions . DB03128 ( ACh ) has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory function by down-modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Its availability can be regulated at different levels , namely at its synthesis and degradation steps . Accordingly , the expression of acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , the enzyme responsible for ACh hydrolysis , has been observed to be modulated in inflammation . To further address the mechanisms underlying this effect , we aimed here at characterizing P22303 expression in distinct cellular types pivotal to the inflammatory response . This study was performed in the human acute leukaemia monocytyc cell line , THP-1 , in human monocyte-derived primary macrophages and in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . In order to subject these cells to inflammatory conditions , THP-1 and macrophage were treated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) from E.coli and HUVEC were stimulated with the tumour necrosis factor α ( P01375 -α ) . Our results showed that although P22303 expression was generally up-regulated at the mRNA level under inflammatory conditions , distinct P22303 protein expression profiles were surprisingly observed among the distinct cellular types studied . Altogether , these results argue for the existence of cell specific mechanisms that regulate the expression of acetylcholinesterase in inflammation .
