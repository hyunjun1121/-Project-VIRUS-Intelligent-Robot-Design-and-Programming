DB06643 for joints and bones . DB06643 is an investigational , fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity and specificity for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family . O14788 , an essential mediator of osteoclast formation , function , and survival , plays a major role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis , structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis , and bone loss associated with other skeletal disorders . DB06643 suppresses bone turnover by inhibiting the action of O14788 on osteoclasts . DB06643 reduces bone turnover and increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density , reduces fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis , and inhibits structural damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis when added to ongoing methotrexate treatment . It is generally well tolerated , with a good safety profile . Adverse and serious adverse events , including infections and malignancy , are similar in patients treated with denosumab or placebo .
