[ Effects of milkvetch root on neuro-endocrino-immune network in asthma model rat ] . OBJECTIVE : To study the change and the effect of milkvetch root ( MR ) on neuro-endocrino-immune ( NEI ) network related indexes in repeated asthmatic attack model rats . METHODS : Rats were randomly divided into five groups : the normal group ( A ) , the model group ( B ) , and the three treated groups ( C , D , E ) treated with low , medium and high dose of the MR by gastrogavage . The corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) mRNA expression in hypothalamus was tested by Realtime-PCR , serum adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) and corticosterone ( O00230 ) were detected with radioimmunoassay , serum P05231 , P05112 , P01579 determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and the lung tissue pathology was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining . RESULTS : As compared with the normal group , in the rats 3 weeks after modeling , P06850 mRNA expression , blood P01579 and plasma DB01285 were unchanged , serum level of O00230 raised significantly ( P < 0.05 ) , P05231 and P05112 showed an increasing trend but without significance . Low dose of MR could promote the production of serum O00230 , and hight dose of MR could down-regulate the concentrations of P05112 and P05231 ( P < 0.01 ) . No significant difference was found in comparison of pathological changes of lung tissue among the groups . CONCLUSION : Rats suffered from repeated asthmatic attack have some disorders in indexes of NEI , MR could enhance the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis and adjust the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines to alleviate the inflammation of asthma .
