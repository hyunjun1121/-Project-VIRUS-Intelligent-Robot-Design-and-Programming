Pretreatment of sildenafil attenuates ischemia-reperfusion renal injury in rats . DB00203 was the first selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) to be widely used for treating erectile dysfunction . Many recent studies have investigated the cardioprotective role of sildenafil in animal models . We evaluated the protective effects of sildenafil in experimental renal ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury in two studies . In study 1 , male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups : sham , sildenafil-treated sham , vehicle-treated IR , and sildenafil-treated IR groups . In study 2 , we divided the rats into two groups : sildenafil-treated IR rats and PD98059 ( P29323 inhibitor ) +sildenafil-treated IR rats . Functional parameters of the kidney were evaluated at the molecular and structural levels . Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine levels were lower in sildenafil-treated IR rats than in vehicle-treated IR rats . The expression of inducible ( P35228 ) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) proteins in sildenafil-treated IR rats was significantly higher than in vehicle-treated IR rats . Pretreatment with sildenafil in IR rats increased P29323 phosphorylation and reduced the renal Bax/Bcl-2 ratio , renal caspase-3 activity , and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling-positive apoptotic cells . In contrast , PD98059 treatment increased BUN and serum creatinine levels and attenuated the sildenafil-induced expression of pERK , P35228 , P29474 , and Bcl-2 . PD98059 also increased caspase-3 activity but did not decrease the sildenafil-induced accumulation of cGMP . In conclusion , this study suggests that sildenafil has antiapoptotic effects in experimental IR renal injury via P29323 phosphorylation , induction of P35228 and P29474 production , and a decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio .
