P01375 -α-mediated cardiorenal injury after rhabdomyolysis in rats . The P01375 -α serum level increases after rhabdomyolysis and is involved in the subsequent cardiorenal injury . In the present study , we investigated the P01375 -α-dependent cell signaling pathways implicated in cellular injury in these organs . Rhabdomyolysis was induced by intramuscular glycerol injection in rats . Renal function , cardiac and renal pathology , and activation of caspases were evaluated during the first 24 h after glycerol injection . P01375 -α blockade with infliximab reduced tubular necrosis and cardiorenal apoptosis . Cellular Fas-associated protein with death domain-like IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein ( cFLIP ) , an inhibitor of caspase-8 , was overexpressed in the kidney but not in the heart . The inhibitory effect of cFLIP blunted caspase-8 activation in the kidney . In this condition , the cellular response to the P01375 -α stimulus was driven to receptor-interacting protein-1 ( Q13546 ) -mediated necroptosis . Treatment with Q13546 inhibitor ( necrostatin-1 ) isolated or in combination with infliximab showed a similar reduction in tubular necrosis , underscoring the importance of P01375 -α-mediated tubular necroptosis in this model . P01375 -α played a positive regulatory role in the transcription of proapoptotic Bax and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis ( PUMA ) proteins . DB00065 treatment reduced caspase-9-mediated apoptosis in both organs . Treatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor showed that caspase-8 participated in the process of apoptosis only in the heart , upstream of caspase-9 activation . P01375 -α-mediated necroptosis is the predominant form of tubular injury observed in the glycerol model . P01375 -α up regulates Bax and PUMA proapoptotic proteins , resulting in activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in the kidney and heart .
