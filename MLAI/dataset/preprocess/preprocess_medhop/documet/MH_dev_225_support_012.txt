The antifibrotic effects of plasminogen activation occur via prostaglandin E2 synthesis in humans and mice . P00747 activation to plasmin protects from lung fibrosis , but the mechanism underlying this antifibrotic effect remains unclear . We found that mice lacking plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , which are protected from bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis , exhibit lung overproduction of the antifibrotic lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) . P00747 activation upregulated DB00917 synthesis in alveolar epithelial cells , lung fibroblasts , and lung fibrocytes from saline- and bleomycin-treated mice , as well as in normal fetal and adult primary human lung fibroblasts . This response was exaggerated in cells from Pai1-/- mice . Although enhanced DB00917 formation required the generation of plasmin , it was independent of proteinase-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) and instead reflected proteolytic activation and release of P14210 with subsequent induction of P35354 . That the P14210 / P35354 / DB00917 axis mediates in vivo protection from fibrosis in Pai1-/- mice was demonstrated by experiments showing that a selective inhibitor of the P08581 c- DB00134 increased lung collagen to WT levels while reducing P35354 protein and DB00917 levels . Of clinical interest , fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were found to be defective in their ability to induce P35354 and , therefore , unable to upregulate DB00917 synthesis in response to plasmin or P14210 . These studies demonstrate crosstalk between plasminogen activation and DB00917 generation in the lung and provide a mechanism for the well-known antifibrotic actions of the fibrinolytic pathway .
