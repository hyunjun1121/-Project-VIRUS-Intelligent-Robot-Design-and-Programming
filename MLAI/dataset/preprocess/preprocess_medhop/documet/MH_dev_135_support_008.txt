P00797 inhibition reduces atherosclerotic plaque neovessel formation and regresses advanced atherosclerotic plaques . OBJECTIVE : The interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) in the pathogenesis of advanced atherosclerotic plaques is not well understood . We studied the effects of the renin inhibitor aliskiren on the progression of advanced atherosclerotic plaque in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( ApoE(-/-) ) mice with a special focus on plaque neovessel formation . METHODS AND RESULTS : Four-wk-old ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 wks , and the mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups and administered a vehicle , hydralazine , or aliskiren for an additional 12 wks . DB09026 reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area and plaque neovessel density . It increased the plaque collagen and elastin contents , and reduced plasma angiotensin II levels and plaque macrophage infiltration and cathepsin S ( CatS ) protein . DB09026 also decreased the levels of AT1R , gp91phox , O60603 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and CatS mRNAs in the aortic roots . DB01275 had no beneficial vascular effects , although its administration resulted in the same degree of blood pressure reduction as aliskiren . CatS deficiency mimicked the aliskiren-mediated vasculoprotective effect in the ApoE(-/-) mice , but aliskiren showed no further benefits in ApoE(-/-) CatS(-/-) mice . In vitro , O60603 silencing reduced CatS expression induced by angiotensin II . Moreover , aliskiren or the inhibition of CatS impaired the endothelial cell angiogenic action in vitro or/and ex vivo . CONCLUSION : P00797 inhibition appears to inhibit advanced plaque neovessel formation in ApoE(-/-) mice and to decrease the vascular inflammatory action and extracellular matrix degradation , partly by reducing AT1R/ O60603 -mediated CatS activation and activity , thus regressing advanced atherosclerosis .
