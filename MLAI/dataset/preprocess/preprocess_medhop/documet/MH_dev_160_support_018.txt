Are there predictors of Remicade treatment success or failure ? DB00065 ( Remicade ) is an antitumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) therapy effective in both induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn 's disease . Identifying predictors of response or relapse to infliximab is important given the potential toxicities and cost of this therapy . Currently available data suggest that concurrent immunosuppressant therapy , certain clinical characteristics , biological and immunological markers , and gene polymorphism may correlate with response to infliximab . However , no single variable has been consistently shown or definitely proven in studies to be a predictor of response to infliximab to be of practical value in current clinical practice . Data from the literature in these areas are reviewed in this article , pointing to the need for additional research in this topic .
