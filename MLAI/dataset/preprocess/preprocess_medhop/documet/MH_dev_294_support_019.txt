Involvement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia cells . Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) was originally found to induce proliferation and differentiation of normal granulocyte progenitors . Recent studies demonstrated that G- P04141 induces growth of some malignant cells , including lymphoid cells . G- P04141 is now widely and successfully used to treat neutropenia induced by intensive chemotherapy , and the responsive growth of malignant cells becomes a major clinical issue . Adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) is a malignant lymphoid disease of T cells , etiologically associated with human T cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) . We demonstrated that primary ATL cells in about 80 % of patients expressed cell surface Q99062 ( G-CSFR ) . Our recent data also show that ATL cells from a third of the patients show responsive growth to G- P04141 ex vivo . Several patients whose ATL cells proliferated in response to G- P04141 showed a significant increase of the ATL cell count after administration of G- P04141 in vivo . These observations suggest caution for it 's routine clinical use in ATL . The molecular mechanism of G- P04141 responsive growth of ATL cells is obscure , however the population of G-CSFR expressing cells is larger in responsive cases than in nonresponsive cases . Expression of G-CSFR on ATL cells may relate to the expression of Tax protein encoded by HTLV-I . Precise studies on G-CSFR signaling in ATL cells are necessary for the safe use of G- P04141 routinely for ATL patients .
