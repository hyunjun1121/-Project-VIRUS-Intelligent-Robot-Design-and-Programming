DB05025 , a coinducer of heat shock proteins for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Recent years have seen an explosion of research into increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative diseases . DB05025 ( BRX-220 ) , being developed by CytRx Corp , is an oral therapeutic candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) , the most common form of motor neuron disease . P35858 is a fatal , incurable disorder , which can present as sporadic ( 90 to 95 % of cases ) or familial ( 5 to 10 % of cases ) forms . The etiology of sporadic P35858 remains unknown and much of the understanding of P35858 pathogenesis has been derived through study of its familial forms ; in particular , through study of autosomal dominant mutations in the P00441 ( copper/zinc superoxide dismutase ) gene , which cause approximately 20 % of familial P35858 cases . Under conditions of excessive stress , arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death . Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival , even after symptom onset . Clinical trials have reported good tolerability and safety . This paper discusses the rationale for arimoclomol use in P35858 , the preclinical and clinical evidence collected to date , the likelihood of its promising preclinical results translating to humans , and the relevance of this research for neurodegeneration as a whole .
