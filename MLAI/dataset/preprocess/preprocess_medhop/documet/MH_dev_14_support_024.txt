A kinase independent function for Tec kinase Q08881 in regulating antigen receptor induced serum response factor activation . The Tec family kinases are critical downstream regulators of antigen receptor signals in lymphocytes . As kinases , they act on critical substrates to regulate signals such as calcium increase leading to activation of transcription factors such as NFAT , NFkappaB and P11831 . We now show here that Q08881 , a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases , has a kinase independent function . Mutants of Q08881 that lack kinase activity or a kinase domain can rescue cells lacking Tec family kinases for antigen receptor induced P11831 activation , but not for NFAT , AP-1 or NFkappaB activation . Furthermore , expression of these mutants in WT cells enhanced P11831 activation . This kinase independent function required the SH2 domain since a mutant lacking both the kinase and SH2 domains was much less effective at rescuing P11831 activation . This kinase-deleted mutant could partially rescue P29323 activation , and interact with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during antigen receptor signaling , suggesting that Q08881 uses a scaffolding function that regulates signals leading to specific regulation of P11831 activation .
