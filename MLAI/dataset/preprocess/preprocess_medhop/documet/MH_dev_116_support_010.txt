Titration of KATP channel expression in mammalian cells utilizing recombinant baculovirus transduction . A variety of transfection approaches have been used to deliver plasmids encoding ion channel genes into cells . We have used the baculovirus transduction system , BacMam , to demonstrate transient expression of multi-subunit KATP channels in CHO- P04264 and P29320 -293 EBNA cells using sulfonylurea receptor 1 ( Q09428 ) , SUR2A , SUR2B , and P55040 6.2 genes . [ 3H ] -glyburide binding , patch clamp , and DiBAC4(3) measurements of membrane potential changes were used to monitor channel expression . BacMam delivery of each Q09428 isoform with KIR6.2 was demonstrated based on its pharmacological profiles . Expression levels of Q09428 and KIR6.2 were titrated by varying the viral concentration or time of virus addition , with functional activity measured in as little as 4-6 hours posttransduction . Further increases in BacMam virus induced sufficient KATP expression to dominate membrane potential without pharmacological opening of the channel . Independently altering treatment with virus containing either the Q09428 or KIR6.2 gene revealed interactions among subunits during formation of functional channels in the plasma membrane . This study demonstrates the utility and versatility of BacMam as a valuable gene delivery tool for the study of ion channel function .
