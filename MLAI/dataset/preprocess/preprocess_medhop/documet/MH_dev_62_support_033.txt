Optimizing anti-tumor necrosis factor strategies in inflammatory bowel disease . The introduction of infliximab , a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) , is an important advance in the treatment of Crohn 's disease . DB00065 is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with inflammatory luminal and fistulizing disease . The development of human antichimeric antibodies ( HACAs ) has led to infusion reactions and loss of efficacy in patients treated with infliximab . Strategies to reduce the frequency of HACA formation include induction of immunologic tolerance with a three-dose regimen at 0 , 2 , and 6 weeks followed by systematic maintenance dosing every 8 weeks ; concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine , 6-mercaptopurine , or methotrexate ; and premedication with intravenous corticosteroids . Humanized or fully human anti- P01375 biotechnologic agents , including CDP571 , DB08904 , etanercept , adalimumab , and onercept , are theoretically less immunogenic than the chimeric antibody infliximab . DB00005 is not effective for Crohn 's disease . CDP571 is not effective in unselected patients with active Crohn 's disease , but it may be effective in patients with elevated P02741 . The efficacy of DB08904 , adalimumab , and onercept is under investigation . The different mechanisms of action of these anti- P01375 agents may account for their variable efficacy . Their benefits , however , must be considered in the context of their risks , including infusion reaction ; delayed hypersensitivity-like reaction ; new onset of autoimmunity , with rare cases of drug-induced lupus and new-onset demyelination ; and the potential for rare but serious infections .
