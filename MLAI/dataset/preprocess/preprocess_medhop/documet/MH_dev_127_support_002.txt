DB08816 as an alternative in clopidogrel-associated neutropenia . DB00945 in combination with platelet Q9H244 receptor blocker has become the mainstay antiplatelet treatment strategy for the prevention of stent thrombosis . DB00208 was the first widely used Q9H244 receptor blockers , but clopidogrel has mostly replaced the use of ticlopidine due to its more favorable adverse event profile on bone marrow . However , when clopidogrel induced bone marrow toxicity occurs , little is known about the efficacy and safety of alternative treatments , and thus , in these cases , medical decisions may be very difficult . We report a case of clopidogrel-induced severe neutropenia in a patient treated with coronary stent and safety of alternative treatment with ticagrelor .
