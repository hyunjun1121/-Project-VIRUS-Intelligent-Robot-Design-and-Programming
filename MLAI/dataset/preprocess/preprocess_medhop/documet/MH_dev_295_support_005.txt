Modeling the neurovascular niche : murine strain differences mimic the range of responses to chronic hypoxia in the premature newborn . Preterm birth results in significant cognitive and motor disabilities , but recent evidence suggests that there is variable recovery over time . One possibility that may explain this variable recovery entails variable neurogenic responses in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) following the period of chronic hypoxia experienced by these neonates . In this report , we have characterized the responses to chronic hypoxia of two mouse strains that represent a wide range of susceptibility to chronic hypoxia . We determined that C57BL/6 pups and neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) derived from them exhibit a blunted response to hypoxic insult compared with CD-1 pups and NPCs . Specifically , C57BL/6 pups and NPCs exhibited blunted in vivo and in vitro proliferative and increased apoptotic responses to hypoxic insult . Additionally , C57BL/6 NPCs exhibited lower baseline levels and hypoxia-induced levels of selected transcription factors , growth factors , and receptors ( including HIF-1alpha , Q9GZT9 , P23560 , P15692 , P48061 , TrkB , Nrp-1 , P61073 , and NO ) that determine , in part , the responsiveness to chronic hypoxic insult compared with CD-1 pups and NPCs , providing insight into this important and timely problem in perinatology .
