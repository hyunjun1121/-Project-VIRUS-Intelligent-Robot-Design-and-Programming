Association of P22309 Gly71Arg with urine urobilinogen . Bilirubin is glucoronized by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 ( P22309 ) mainly in the liver , and excreted into bile . The conjugated form is metabolized into the unconjugated form , and then into urobilinogen by bacteria in the intestine . Unconjugated bilirubin and urobilinogen are absorbed into the blood stream . The kidney filtrates conjugated bilurubin and urobilinogen into urine . Accordingly , the reduced enzyme activity of UGTIAI may decrease serum conjugated bilirubin levels , resulting in a lower frequency of positive results of urine bilirubin and urobilinogen . This study examined the associations of UGTIAI Gly71Arg ( UGTIAI *6 ) with urine bilirubin and urobilinogen , as well as serum Q9NRA2 , ALT and P19440 . Subjects were 5,172 inhabitants 35 to 69 years old who participated in a cohort study in Nagoya from June 2008 to May 2010 . Among them , data from 5,151 participants ( 1,465 males and 3,686 females ) were available for analysis . The age-sex-adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of ArgArg relative to GlyGly was 1.37 ( 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , 0.55-1.23 ) for bilirubin , and 1.67 ( 95 % CI , 0.86-3.26 ) for urobilinogen . Those of ArgArg+ArgGly were 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.59-1.27 ) and 1.50 ( 95 % CI , 1.17-1.94 ) , respectively . Q9NRA2 , ALT and P19440 levels had no associations with the genotype . Although the significant association for urobilinogen was contrary to the biological expectation , this study indicated that UGTIA1 Gly71Arg may be a genetic factor of urine urobilinogen .
