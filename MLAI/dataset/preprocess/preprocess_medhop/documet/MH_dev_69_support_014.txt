Identification of tyrosine hydroxylase as a physiological substrate for Cdk5 . P12004 -dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) is emerging as a neuronal protein kinase involved in multiple aspects of neurotransmission in both post- and presynaptic compartments . Within the reward/motor circuitry of the basal ganglia , Cdk5 regulates dopamine neurotransmission via phosphorylation of the postsynaptic signal transduction pathway integrator , Q9UD71 ( dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein , M(r) 32,000 ) . Cdk5 has also been implicated in regulating various steps in the presynaptic vesicle cycle . Here we report that Cdk5 phosphorylates tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) , the key enzyme for synthesis of dopamine . Using phosphopeptide mapping , site-directed mutagenesis , and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies , the site was identified as Ser31 , a previously defined extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) site . The phosphorylation of Ser31 by Cdk5 versus P27361 /2 was investigated in intact mouse striatal tissue using a pharmacological approach . The results indicated that Cdk5 phosphorylates TH directly and also regulates P27361 /2-dependent phosphorylation of TH through the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 ( Q02750 ) . Finally , phospho-Ser31 TH levels were increased in dopaminergic neurons of rats trained to chronically self-administer cocaine . These results demonstrate direct and indirect regulation of the phosphorylation state of a Cdk5/ P27361 /2 site on TH and suggest a role for these pathways in the neuroadaptive changes associated with chronic cocaine exposure .
