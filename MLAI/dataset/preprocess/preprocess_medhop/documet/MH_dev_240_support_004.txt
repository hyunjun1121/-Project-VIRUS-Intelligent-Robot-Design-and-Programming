Q14790 and RIP kinases regulate bacteria-induced innate immune responses and cell death . A number of pathogens cause host cell death upon infection , and Yersinia pestis , infamous for its role in large pandemics such as the " Black Death " in medieval Europe , induces considerable cytotoxicity . The rapid killing of macrophages induced by Y. pestis , dependent upon type III secretion system effector Yersinia outer protein J ( YopJ ) , is minimally affected by the absence of caspase-1 , caspase-11 , P48023 , and P01375 . Q14790 is known to mediate apoptotic death in response to infection with several viruses and to regulate programmed necrosis ( necroptosis ) , but its role in bacterially induced cell death is poorly understood . Here we provide genetic evidence for a receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) kinase-caspase-8-dependent macrophage apoptotic death pathway after infection with Y. pestis , influenced by O00206 -TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β ( O00206 - Q8IUC6 ) . Interestingly , macrophages lacking either Q13546 , or caspase-8 and RIP3 , also had reduced infection-induced production of IL-1β , Q14116 , P01375 , and P05231 ; impaired activation of the transcription factor NF-κB ; and greatly compromised caspase-1 processing . Cleavage of the proform of caspase-1 is associated with triggering inflammasome activity , which leads to the maturation of IL-1β and Q14116 , cytokines important to host responses against Y. pestis and many other infectious agents . Our results identify a Q13546 -caspase-8/RIP3-dependent caspase-1 activation pathway after Y. pestis challenge . Mice defective in caspase-8 and RIP3 were also highly susceptible to infection and displayed reduced proinflammatory cytokines and myeloid cell death . We propose that caspase-8 and the RIP kinases are key regulators of macrophage cell death , NF-κB and inflammasome activation , and host resistance after Y. pestis infection .
