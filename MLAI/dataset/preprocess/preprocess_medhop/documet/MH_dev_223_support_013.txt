Discovery of selective Q07343 inhibitors . In this study the first Q07343 selective inhibitor is described . Optimization of lead 2-arylpyrimidine derivatives afforded a series of potent Q07343 inhibitors with > 100-fold selectivity over the Q08499 isozyme . With a good pharmacokinetic profile , a selected compound exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and showed less emesis compared with DB03849 .
