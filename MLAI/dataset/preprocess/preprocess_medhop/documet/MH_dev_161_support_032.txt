The influence of non-HLA gene polymorphisms and interactions on disease risk in a Western Australian multiple sclerosis cohort . Non-Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes have concomitant , although modest , effects on multiple sclerosis ( MS ) susceptibility ; however findings have varied in different populations . Here we present the results of an association study of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 10 non-HLA genes ( P16871 , P01589 , CLEC-16A , P29597 , P19256 , Q13568 , P40763 , P16410 , P02649 , P05362 ) in a Western Australian cohort of 350 MS patients and 498 population control subjects . Our results indicate that in this population , SNPs in P16871 , P29597 , Q13568 and P02649 have modifying effects on MS susceptibility . We also found evidence of interactive protective effects between polymorphisms in the P16871 / P19256 , CLEC-16A/ P16410 , and P29597 / Q13568 genes , which in some instances are restricted within HLA- or gender-defined groups .
