DB08904 in axial spondyloarthritis . The axial spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) classification criteria cover both patients with ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA . After failure of NSAIDs P01375 -Î±-inhibitors ( P01375 -blockers ) can be given to patients with active axial SpA . Until recently , the P01375 -blockers infliximab , adalimumab , etanercept and DB06674 are labeled for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis while for active nr-axSpA only adalimumab has been approved in Europe . The P01375 -blocker certolizumab pegol has recently been evaluated in the RAPID-axSpA trial which is the first placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial in the entire group of axial SpA . An elevated P02741 and/ or evidence of bone marrow edema on Q9BWK5 of the sacroiliac joints were required for inclusion in RAPID-axSpA , and patients could have been preexposed to P01375 -blockers . The interesting data of this important trial in the context of the emerging therapeutic field of non-radiographic axial SpA therapy is discussed in this review .
