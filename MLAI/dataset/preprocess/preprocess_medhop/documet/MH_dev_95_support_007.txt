Astaxanthin functions differently as a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ modulator in adipocytes and macrophages . Astaxanthin ( ASX ) , an oxygenated carotenoid ( xanthophyll ) , has previously been shown to exert ameliorative effects on obesity and insulin resistance , but the underlying mechanisms were not clearly elucidated . In the present study , we investigated whether ASX serves as a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) γ modulator . Analyses of PPARγ binding by DB01992 -BAP assays revealed that ASX bound to PPARγ in a dose-dependent manner . However , ASX was unable to activate transcription in PPARγ reporter assays , although it antagonized transcriptional activation by the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone ( RGZ ) . When the molecular interactions between PPARγ and three coactivators were examined , ASX increased the interactions of PPARγ with transcriptional intermediary factor 2 ( Q15596 ) and steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) , but not DB02527 responsive element-binding protein ( CREB ) -binding protein ( CBP ) . In addition , ASX effectively blocked the increase in CBP recruitment to PPARγ mediated by RGZ . ASX alone did not stimulate 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cell differentiation , although it antagonized 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cell differentiation and lipid accumulation induced by RGZ , similar to the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 . When the effects of cotreatment of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells with ASX and RGZ were determined based on the mRNA levels of PPARγ target genes , ASX effectively reduced the mRNA levels of aP2 and lipoprotein lipase , but not P16671 . Intriguingly , ASX was capable of inducing PPARγ target genes such as liver X receptor , P16671 and O95477 in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages . Collectively , the present findings indicate that ASX is a novel selective PPARγ modulator that acts as an antagonist or agonist depending on the cell context .
