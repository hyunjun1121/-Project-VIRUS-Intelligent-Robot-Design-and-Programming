Long-term follow-up of symptomatic patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia treated with the anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab . P31358 is expressed on malignant cells in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( P06858 ) , including IgM-secreting Waldenström macroglobulinemia ( WM ) . We examined the activity of alemtuzumab in 28 symptomatic P06858 ( 27 IgM and 1 IgA ) patients . The median prior number of therapies for these patients was 2 ( range , 0-5 ) and 43 % had refractory disease . Patients received alemtuzumab at 30 mg IV 3 times weekly for up to 12 weeks after test dosing , and also received hydrocortisone , acyclovir , and Bactrim or equivalent prophylaxis . Patients had a complete response ( n = 1 ) , a partial response ( n = 9 ) , or a MR ( n = 11 ) for an overall and major response rate of 75 % and 36 % , respectively . Median serum Ig decreased from 3510 to 1460 mg/dL ( P < .001 at best response ) . With a median follow-up of 64 months , the median time to progression was 14.5 months . Hematologic and infectious complications , including CMV reactivation , were more common in previously treated patients and were indirectly associated with 3 deaths . Long-term follow-up revealed late-onset autoimmune thrombocytopenia ( AITP ) in 4 patients at a median of 13.6 months after therapy , which contributed to 1 death . DB00087 is an active therapy in patients with P06858 , but short- and long-term toxicities need to be carefully weighed against other available treatment options . Late AITP is a newly recognized complication of alemtuzumab in this patient population . This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00142181 .
