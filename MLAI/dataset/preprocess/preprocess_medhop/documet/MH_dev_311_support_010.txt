[ A genetic view of addiction ] . The genetic analyses of addictions recently converted to genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) and thanks to national and international consortia , allowed to recruit large cohorts of patients . This approach allowed the identification of the first susceptibility gene in addiction ( tobacco ) , with genes P30532 , P32297 and P30926 encoding the α5 , α3 and b4 subunits involved in the formation of nicotinic receptors , explaining 14 % of the attributable risk for tobacco dependence . Variants of P00325 and P00326 genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases enzymes have also been consistently associated , this time with alcohol dependence ( AD ) . Finally , P14416 and Q8NFD2 genes , involved in the dopaminergic pathway , and which were initially associated with AD , are now considered to be involved in a broader phenotype ( addiction to psychoactive substances ) including opiates . Future directions in molecular study of addiction are gene x environment interactions though the epigenetic approach . Numerous studies already investigated the methylome in addiction , including histone and microRNA modifications .
