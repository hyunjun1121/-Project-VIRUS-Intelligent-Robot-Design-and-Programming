P00734 in normal human cerebrospinal fluid originates from the blood . In spite of the fact that prothrombin is produced by cells within the central nervous system , its presence in the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) has not been investigated . We determined the concentration of prothrombin in P04141 with reference to the concentration in plasma in paired samples from 18 " normal " control patients and 4 patients with relapsing-remitting type of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The newly developed ELISA was very specific ( no cross-reactivity with thrombin ) and sensitive ( detection limit -- 0.7 ng/ml ) with an imprecision of CV = 8.3 % ( intraseries ) and 7.0 % ( interassay ) . The mean prothrombin concentration in normal P04141 was 0.55 mg/l ( CV +/- 33 % , range : 0.28-0.93 mg/l ) , in normal plasma 121.8 mg/l +/- 21 % , resulting in a mean P04141 /plasma concentration quotient ( Q(Proth) -- 4.5 x 10(-3) ( CV +/- 35 % , range : 2.1-8.3 x 10(-3) ) corresponding to a mean albumin quotient in this group of subjects of Q(Alb) = 5.8 x 10(-3) . Due to the Q(Proth) and the molecular weight of prothrombin ( 72 kDa ) -- similar to that of albumin -- we conclude that prothrombin in normal human P04141 originates predominantly ( > 95 % ) from blood . The enzymatic activity in P04141 is conserved . Comparable results obtained in MS patients with only few small Q9BWK5 lesions suggest that local chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system does not influence prothrombin concentration in the P04141 if the blood- P04141 barrier function is normal .
