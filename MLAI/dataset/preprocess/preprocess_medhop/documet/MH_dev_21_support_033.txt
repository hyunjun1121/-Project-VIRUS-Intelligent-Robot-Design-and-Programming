Modulation of leukocyte transendothelial migration by integrin-associated glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol ( P06744 ) -anchored proteins . Leukocyte transendothelial migration is an essential process in inflammation and the immune response . The mechanisms involved in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium , forming the first step in leukocyte extravasation , have been fairly well documented . However , subsequent steps , which include de-adhesion , coupled with locomotion , remain largely unknown . As part of our efforts to study leukocyte transendothelial migration , we previously established a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that sequentially up-regulates and down-regulates beta2 integrin-dependent adhesion of human neutrophils , as well as transendothelial migration in vitro . The molecule recognized by this mAb is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol , ( P06744 ) -anchored glycoprotein . This protein may prove to be a new member of the family of integrin-associated , P06744 -anchored proteins , which includes urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) /LPS binding protein ( P18428 ) receptor ( P08571 ) , and Fcgamma receptor IIIB ( CD16b ) ; all of which are regulators of integrin function . The mechanisms involved in beta2 integrin regulation by this new P06744 -anchored glycoprotein are discussed .
