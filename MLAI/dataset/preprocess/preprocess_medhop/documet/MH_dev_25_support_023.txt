T-cell phenotype in protocol renal biopsy from transplant recipients treated with belatacept-mediated co-stimulatory blockade . BACKGROUND : DB06681 is thought to disrupt the interaction between P33681 /86 and P10747 , thus preventing T-cell activation by blocking the co-stimulatory second signal . However , the consequences on the T-cell profile in human renal transplant cases have not been determined . METHODS : In this study , we analysed intra-graft levels of the mRNAs for Treg ( Q9BZS1 ) , cytotoxic CD8 T cells ( P10144 ) , Th1 ( INFγ , Tbet ) , Th2 ( P23771 ) and Th17 ( RORγt and Q16552 ) in protocol biopsies obtained 12 months after renal transplantation in recipients treated with DB06681 or calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) . RESULTS : Only the intra-graft abundance of Q9BZS1 mRNA was significantly lower ( P < 0.001 ) in the DB06681 group than the CNI group . Conclusions . These results are in agreement with in vitro data suggesting that P10747 is a major co-stimulatory signal of both Tregs development and peripheral homeostasis but contrast with clinical trials showing a better 1-year graft function and a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy in patients receiving DB06681 than patients treated with CNI . They suggest that immune benefits induced by DB06681 are not mediated by Treg expansion and that Q9BZS1 is not by itself a prognostic marker of long-term graft function in a non-inflammatory context . These results have to be , however , considered as preliminary since the size of our study population is limited .
