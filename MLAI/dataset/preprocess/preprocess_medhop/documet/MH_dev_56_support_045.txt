P01375 -α in vitiligo : direct correlation between tissue levels and clinical parameters . BACKGROUND : Experimental evidences have shown that tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α may play a role in the pathogenesis of nonsegmental vitiligo , and successful cases of vitiligo treated with P01375 -α inhibitors have been recently reported . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two cases of refractory generalized vitiligo , which showed high tissue levels of P01375 -α , were commenced anti- P01375 -α antibody etanercept 50 mg weekly . A retrospective study , considering chart review and immunohistochemical staining for P01375 -α , was then carried out on eight additional patients affected by untreated vitiligo . RESULTS : DB00005 achieved improvement of vitiligo in two patients at 6-month follow-up . Five out of eight specimens showed a strong cytoplasmic staining for P01375 -α . Considering all 10 cases , patients with a strong P01375 -α staining were characterized by a higher vitiligo disease activity score than patients with a weak staining . DISCUSSION : These findings , albeit limited in significance by the low number of cases and the retrospective nature of the study , confirm a probable role of P01375 -α in the pathogenesis of vitiligo . The intensity of P01375 -α staining in vitiligo lesions may be worth to be further studied as a biomarker for potentially successful anti- P01375 -α treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in cases refractory to conventional treatment .
