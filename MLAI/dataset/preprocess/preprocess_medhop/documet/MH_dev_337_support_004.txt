Biochemical properties of V91G calmodulin : A calmodulin point mutation that deregulates muscle contraction in Drosophila . A mutation ( Cam7 ) to the single endogenous calmodulin gene of Drosophila generates a mutant protein with valine 91 changed to glycine ( V91G D- P62158 ) . This mutation produces a unique pupal lethal phenotype distinct from that of a null mutation . Genetic studies indicate that the phenotype reflects deregulation of calcium fluxes within the larval muscles , leading to hypercontraction followed by muscle failure . We investigated the biochemical properties of V91G D- P62158 . The effects of the mutation on free P62158 are minor : DB01373 binding , and overall secondary and tertiary structure are indistinguishable from those of wild type . A slight destabilization of the C-terminal domain is detectable in the calcium-free ( apo- ) form , and the calcium-bound ( holo- ) form has a somewhat lower surface hydrophobicity . These findings reinforce the indications from the in vivo work that interaction with a specific P62158 target(s) underlies the mutant defects . In particular , defective regulation of ryanodine receptor ( RyR ) channels was indicated by genetic interaction analysis . Studies described here establish that the putative P62158 binding region of the Drosophila RyR ( D-RyR ) binds wild-type D- P62158 comparably to the equivalent P62158 -RyR interactions seen for the mammalian skeletal muscle RyR channel isoform ( P21817 ) . The V91G mutation weakens the interaction of both apo- and holo-D- P62158 with this binding region , and decreases the enhancement of the calcium-binding affinity of P62158 that is detectable in the presence of the RyR target peptide . The predicted functional consequences of these changes are consonant with the in vivo phenotype , and indicate that D-RyR is one , if not the major , target affected by the V91G mutation in P62158 .
