Immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma . Melanoma has traditionally been considered an immunogenic tumor . A number of approaches have been studied for enhancement of antitumor immunity . The first cytokine approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma , interleukin-2 , has resulted in prolonged responses in a small subset of patients , providing hope that immunotherapy might be useful for this disease . DB06186 , a monoclonal antibody to P16410 , was recently approved and a number of other promising investigational approaches are currently being pursued . This manuscript discusses more recent advances in the treatment of melanoma employing a variety of immune-enhancing approaches .
