Inactivating cholecystokinin-2 receptor inhibits progastrin-dependent colonic crypt fission , proliferation , and colorectal cancer in mice . Hyperproliferation of the colonic epithelium , leading to expansion of colonic crypt progenitors , is a recognized risk factor for colorectal cancer . Overexpression of progastrin , a nonamidated and incompletely processed product of the gastrin gene , has been shown to induce colonic hyperproliferation and promote colorectal cancer in mice , but the mechanism of pathogenesis has not been defined . P32239 ( CCK2R ) is the primary receptor for cholecystokinin ( CCK ) and amidated gastrin . Here , we show that Cck2r was expressed in murine colonic crypts and upregulated in the transgenic mice that overexpress human progastrin . Murine deletion of Cck2r abrogated progastrin-dependent increases in colonic proliferation , mucosal thickness , and beta-catenin and P16070 expression in the colon tumor . In addition , either deletion or antagonism of Cck2r resulted in the inhibition of progastrin-dependent increases in progenitors expressing doublecortin and P62158 kinase-like-1 ( O15075 ) , stem cells expressing leucine rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 ( LgR5 ) , and colonic crypt fission . Furthermore , in the azoxymethane mouse model of colorectal carcinogenesis , Cck2r deletion in human progastrin-overexpressing mice resulted in markedly decreased aberrant crypt foci formation and substantially reduced tumor size and multiplicity . Taken together , these observations indicate that progastrin induces proliferative effects , primarily in colonic progenitor cells , through a CCK2R-dependent pathway . Moreover , our data suggest that CCK2R may be a potential target in the treatment or prevention of colorectal cancer .
