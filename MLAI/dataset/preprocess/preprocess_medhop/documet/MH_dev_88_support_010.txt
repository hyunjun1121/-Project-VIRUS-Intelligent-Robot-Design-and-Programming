Bovine somatotropin attenuates phorbol ester-induced prostaglandin F2alpha production in bovine endometrial cells . The recent observation that bovine somatotropin ( bST ) treatment at a timed insemination improves pregnancy rates in lactating dairy cows raises the possibility that growth hormone ( GH ) may modulate the endocrine and biochemical cross talk between the conceptus and maternal uterus at the time of pregnancy establishment in cattle . The objective of this study was to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which exogenous GH affects phorbol ester-induced prostaglandin F2alpha ( PGF2alpha ) production in cultured bovine endometrial ( BEND ) cells . Serum-deprived BEND cells were incubated with or without recombinant bovine GH ( rbGH ) , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I , recombinant bovine interferon ( rbIFN ) -tau or a combination of rbGH + rbIFN-tau for 3 h and then treated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ( PDBu ) for an additional 6 h . Exogenous PDBu increased PGF2alpha secretion and steady-state levels of P35354 mRNA within 3 h . Priming of BEND cells with rbGH reduced PGF2alpha response to PDBu , whereas cotreatment with P05019 amplified PDBu induction of PGF2alpha . Preincubation of cell monolayers with rbIFN-tau suppressed PGF2alpha and P35354 mRNA responses to PDBu . Inhibitory effects of rbGH and rbIFN-tau on PDBu-induced PGF2alpha production were additive . Results provide the first direct evidence that supplemental bST may interact with conceptus-secreted IFN-tau to modulate PGF2alpha secretion at the critical time of maternal recognition of pregnancy .
