Pulmonary infectious complications of tumor necrosis factor blockade . The understanding of the infection risks posed by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists has continued to evolve in the 10 years since these drugs first were introduced . Recent prospective studies have confirmed the risk of tuberculosis ( TB ) reactivation posed by P01375 antibodies to be several fold greater than soluble P01375 receptor . DB08904 , a monovalent anti- P01375 Fab ' fragment , appears to share this risk , despite its lack of Fc and its inability to cross-link transmembrane P01375 or activate complement . Two-step ( boosted ) tuberculin skin test screening and initiation of treatment for latent TB infection can greatly reduce the TB risk of anti- P01375 treatment in western countries . Current recommendations for withdrawal of anti- P01375 therapy when TB is diagnosed place patients at risk for paradoxical worsening due to recovery of P01375 -dependent inflammation . Further research is needed to determine how best to prevent and manage their infectious complications and to determine their potential adjunctive therapeutic role in chronic infectious diseases .
