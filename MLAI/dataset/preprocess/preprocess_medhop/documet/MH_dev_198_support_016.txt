Human decorin regulates proliferation and migration of human lung cancer A549 cells . BACKGROUND : P07585 is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan and it plays an important role in regulation of cell growth and migration in various tumor cell lines . P07585 was found down-regulated in non-small cell lung cancer tissue and may be involved in regulation of lung cancer development . METHODS : In this study , lentivirus-mediated RNA interference and over expression were employed to change the expression levels of decorin in lung cancer A549 cells . We tested the cell cycle of A549 cells and the expression of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β , cyclin D1 , epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , P04637 , and P21 . RESULTS : We found that up-regulation of decorin could inhibit proliferation , block cell cycle at P55008 and decrease invasive activity of A549 cells . Moreover , we also show that up-regulation of decorin induced significant decreases of TGF-β1 , cyclin D1 expression , phosphorylation of P00533 , and increases of P04637 and P21 expression . Opposite results were observed in A549 cells with down-regulation of decorin . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that decorin is a key regulator involved in proliferation and migration of A549 cells .
