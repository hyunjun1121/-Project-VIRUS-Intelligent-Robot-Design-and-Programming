Efficacy and safety of P01375 -α inhibitors in refractory primary complex aphthosis : a patient series and overview of the literature . BACKGROUND : Otherwise healthy patients with severe recurrent mucocutaneous aphthous ulcerations ( complex aphthosis ) may require systemic immunomodulatory therapy . However , a subset of patients remain resistant or intolerant to recommended therapeutic agents . Recently , case reports have described that tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) inhibitors may induce remission in these patients . METHODS : Data on efficacy and safety of various P01375 -α inhibitors used as monotherapy in a case series of 18 patients with refractory primary complex aphthosis are presented . RESULTS : A total of 16 patients ( 89 % ) obtained complete or almost clearance of orogenital aphthous ulcerations rapidly after onset of therapy either with etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab or DB06674 . Duration of treatment ranged between 3 and 77 months . Nine patients ( 50 % ) received more than one P01375 -α inhibitor during the course of treatment . Five ( 28 % ) patients experienced side effects that could be related to treatment with P01375 -α inhibitors . CONCLUSION : P01375 -α inhibitors are an effective and safe treatment option for patients with severe complex aphthosis who do not respond sufficiently to standard therapy as recommended by existing guidelines . However , the final position of P01375 -α inhibitors in the therapeutic armamentarium awaits randomized controlled trials .
