Novel multiplex method to assess insulin , leptin and adiponectin regulation of inflammatory cytokines associated with colon cancer . The role of altered levels of insulin , leptin and adiponectin in contributing to the observed increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity remains to be determined . Elevated insulin and leptin associated with obesity are linked to inflammatory responses . Conversely , adiponectin levels are reduced in obese individuals and this hormone is generally associated with anti-inflammatory responses . Inflammatory cytokines are key components of processes linked with carcinogenesis . P01308 , leptin and adiponectin receptor expression profiles were assessed in human normal , adenomatous polyp and tumour tissue . P01308 , leptin and adiponectin regulation of inflammatory cytokines previously identified as being associated with early events in colon carcinogenesis were further investigated here using a surrogate colon epithelial cell line and a custom designed GeXP assay of the inflammatory cytokines ( P78556 , P09341 , P19875 , P19876 , O14625 , P18510 , P02776 , P10145 , Q99731 , O00585 , P55773 , P13501 , Q08334 and P19438 ) . Mean insulin , leptin and adiponectin receptor expression levels were lower in adenomatous polyp samples in comparison with normal and tumour tissue . In contrast to leptin , insulin significantly reduced P78556 and O14625 and increased P19876 expression . Q8N1N2 length adiponectin , but not globular adiponectin , induced P13501 , P09341 , P19876 and P78556 gene expression . GeXP assay permitted measurement of changes in gene expression of cytokines in response to insulin and adiponectin , indicating the potential for insulin and adiponectin regulation of mediators of inflammation associated with early events in colon carcinogenesis .
