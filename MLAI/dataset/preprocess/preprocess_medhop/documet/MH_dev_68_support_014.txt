Involvement of base excision repair in response to therapy targeted at thymidylate synthase . P04818 ( TS ) is an important target of several classes of chemotherapeutic agents . Although the precise mechanism of cytotoxicity in thymidylate deprivation remains obscure , uracil misincorporation and DNA strand breaks are recognized as important events during thymidylate deprivation . Base excision repair ( BER ) plays a primary role in removing damaged or modified bases from the genome , including uracil . Because of uracil misincorporation , BER is hypothesized to play a role in the cellular response to thymidylate deprivation . In this study , we used murine embryo fibroblasts wild-type or homozygous null for P06746 ( beta-pol ) , which plays a central role in BER . We found that , compared with wild-type , beta-pol null cells were resistant to the toxic effects of raltitrexed ( DB00293 , DB00293 ) , a folate inhibitor of TS . There was little difference in TS levels or in TS-ligand complex formation between the cell lines . Furthermore , cells deficient in P18887 , a scaffold protein for the final steps of BER , were also modestly resistant to raltitrexed compared with P18887 -proficient cells . Cell cycle analysis revealed that the responses of the wild-type and beta-pol null cells were similar during drug exposure . However , following drug removal , the beta-pol null cells appeared to resume cell cycle progression more rapidly than the wild-type cells . The results suggest that BER plays a role in modulating the toxic effects of TS inhibitors , and that this role occurs during recovery from TS inhibition .
