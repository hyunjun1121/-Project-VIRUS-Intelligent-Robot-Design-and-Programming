Production and characterization of antibodies to gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor . Antibodies to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptor of bovine pituitary membranes have been raised in rabbits by immunization with affinity-purified receptor preparations . These antibodies did not compete with 125I-labeled DB00644 analog ( DB06719 ) for binding to the receptors but did precipitate rat and bovine solubilized receptors labeled with 125I- DB06719 . Binding of the antibodies to the receptors was also demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled purified receptors and photoaffinity-labeled receptors . The antibodies did not have a DB00644 -like activity but rather inhibited , in a dose-dependent manner , DB00644 -stimulated luteinizing hormone release from cultured rat pituitary cells . In addition , the antibodies did not inhibit luteinizing hormone release stimulated by high K+ concentration . This suggests that the antibodies recognize domains of the receptor other than the binding site of the hormone and thereby inhibit the biological response . These P30968 antibodies provide a useful tool for studying P30968 structure , function , localization , and biosynthesis .
