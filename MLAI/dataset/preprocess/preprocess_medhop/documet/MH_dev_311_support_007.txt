What future for combination therapies ? For most patients who require lipid-lowering treatment , statin monotherapy is the appropriate treatment . However , in those patients where statin monotherapy does not produce optimal lipid levels , the combination of a statin with niacin , a bile acid sequestrant , a fibric acid derivative , a cholesterol absorption inhibitor or a fish oil preparation may provide improved control . The choice of combination therapy depends upon the patient 's lipid profile and tolerability of the medication . Combination of a statin with niacin , a bile acid sequestrant or ezetimibe , a cholesterol absorption inhibitor , should be considered for patients with very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels , while combination with either a fibric acid derivative or a fish oil should be considered for patients with high LDL-C and high triglyceride levels . A number of new lipid-lowering agents are currently in development , including cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) inhibitors , acyl coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ) inhibitors , ileal bile acid transport ( Q12908 ) inhibitors , microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibitors and dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) alpha and gamma agonists . Introduction of these novel therapies will provide opportunities for developing different combination strategies that may help to optimise lipid profiles in patients who are currently difficult to treat . The introduction of new combinations will require careful study to ensure that the risks of drug interactions and adverse events are minimised .
