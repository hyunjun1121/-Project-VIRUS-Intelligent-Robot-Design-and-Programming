Evaluation of cytotoxicity of bevacizumab on P15692 -enriched corneal endothelial cells . PURPOSE : To evaluate the cytotoxicity of varying doses of DB00112 on corneal endothelial cells in the presence of a range of concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . DB00112 , a drug widely used in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma neutralizes all isoforms of P15692 and ameliorates neovascularization after intracameral administration . However , the safety of intracameral administration of DB00112 and dose-dependent toxicity on corneal endothelial cells has not been established . METHODS : Bovine corneal endothelial ( BCE ) cells were treated with P15692 ( 50 ng/ml ) and/or DB00112 ( 0.1-2 mg/ml ) for 72 h . Cell proliferation was measured with the water soluble tetrazolium salts ( WST-1 ) assay . Morphological changes were recorded by bright-field microscopy of cells . Cytotoxicity in response to DB00112 was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion , as well as annexin V/propidium iodide ( PI ) staining . RESULTS : DB00112 was not cytotoxic at the concentrations tested and the percentage of DB00112 -treated cells staining positively for both PI and P08758 was less than 1 % . The anti-proliferative effects of DB00112 on BCE cells were dose-dependent ; a dose of 1.5 mg/ml or 2 mg/ml produced a 33 % ( p=0.005 ) or 47 % ( p=0.001 ) decrease in cell proliferation compared to controls . Similar results were obtained in cells treated with a combination of DB00112 and P15692 . P15692 ( 50 ng/ml ) had no significant effect on cell proliferation compared to controls . Morphology of cells was unchanged after treatment with DB00112 and/or P15692 compared to controls . CONCLUSIONS : DB00112 was safe and not toxic to BCE cells at concentrations commonly used in clinical practice .
