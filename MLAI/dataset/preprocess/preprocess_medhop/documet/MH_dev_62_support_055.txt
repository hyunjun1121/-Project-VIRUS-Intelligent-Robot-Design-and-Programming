How future tumor necrosis factor antagonists and other compounds will meet the remaining challenges in Crohn 's disease . The chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) , infliximab , is an effective therapy for Crohn 's disease . However , the formation of human anti-chimeric antibodies to infliximab ( immunogenicity ) can lead to loss of efficacy as well as acute infusion reactions and delayed hypersensitivity reactions . The fully human monoclonal antibody adalimumab and the pegylated humanized monoclonal antibody fragment DB08904 are biologic therapies against P01375 that might be effective for Crohn 's disease and less immunogenic than infliximab . Other potential alternatives to infliximab for Crohn 's disease include the humanized anti-adhesion molecule antibodies natalizumab and DB05802 , the humanized anti-interleukin 12 antibody ABT-874 , the humanized anti-interferon g antibody fontolizumab , the humanized anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibody DB06273 , and human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ( sargramostim ) . Some , or all , of these therapies will likely represent important treatments for Crohn 's disease in the future .
