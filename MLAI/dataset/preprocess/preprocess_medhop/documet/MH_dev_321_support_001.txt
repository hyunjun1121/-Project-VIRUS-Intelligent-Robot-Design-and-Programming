The opposite effects of P40933 and Q9HBE4 on CLL B cells correlate with differential activation of the JAK/ P35610 and P27361 /2 pathways . The clonal expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells requires the interaction with the microenvironment and is under the control of several cytokines . Here , we investigated the effect of P40933 and Q9HBE4 , which are closely related to P60568 and share the usage of the common gamma chain and of its P52333 -associated pathway . We found remarkable differences in the signal transduction pathways activated by these cytokines , which determined different responses in CLL cells . P40933 caused cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis induced by surface IgM cross-linking . These effects were more evident in cells stimulated via surface P25942 , which exhibited increased cell expression of IL-15Ralpha chain and , in some of the cases , also of IL-2Rbeta . Q9HBE4 failed to induce CLL cell proliferation and instead promoted apoptosis . Following cell exposure to P40933 , phosphorylation of P42229 was predominantly observed , whereas , following stimulation with Q9HBE4 , there was predominant P42224 and P40763 activation . Moreover , P40933 but not Q9HBE4 caused an increased phosphorylation of Shc and P27361 /2 . Pharmacological inhibition of P52333 or of MEK , which phosphorylates P27361 /2 , efficiently blocked P40933 -induced CLL cell proliferation and the antiapoptotic effect of this cytokine . The knowledge of the signaling pathways regulating CLL cell survival and proliferation may provide new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention .
