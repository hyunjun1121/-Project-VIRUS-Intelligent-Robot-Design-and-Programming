Circulating cytokines and monocyte subpopulations as biomarkers of outcome and biological activity in sunitinib-treated patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours . BACKGROUND : DB01268 is approved worldwide for treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours ( pNET ) , but no validated markers exist to predict response . This analysis explored biomarkers associated with sunitinib activity and clinical benefit in patients with pNET and carcinoid tumours in a phase II study . METHODS : Plasma was assessed for vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -A , soluble P15692 receptor ( sVEGFR ) -2 , sVEGFR-3 , interleukin ( IL ) -8 ( n=105 ) , and stromal cell-derived factor ( SDF ) -1α ( n=28 ) . Pre-treatment levels were compared between tumour types and correlated with response , progression-free ( PFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) . Changes in circulating myelomonocytic and endothelial cells were also analysed . RESULTS : Stromal cell-derived factor-1α and sVEGFR-2 levels were higher in pNET than in carcinoid ( P=0.003 and 0.041 , respectively ) . High ( above-median ) baseline SDF-1α was associated with worse PFS , OS , and response in pNET , and high sVEGFR-2 with longer OS ( P⩽0.05 ) . For carcinoid , high P10145 , sVEGFR-3 , and SDF-1α were associated with shorter PFS and OS , and high P10145 and SDF-1α with worse response ( P⩽0.05 ) . Among circulating cell types , monocytes showed the largest on-treatment decrease , particularly P08571 + monocytes co-expressing P17948 or P61073 . CONCLUSIONS : P10145 , sVEGFR-3 , and SDF-1α were identified as predictors of sunitinib clinical outcome . Putative pro-tumorigenic P61073 + and P17948 + monocytes represent novel candidate markers and biologically relevant targets explaining the activity of sunitinib .
