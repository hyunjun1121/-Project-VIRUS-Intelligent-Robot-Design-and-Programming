[ Preliminary study on the mechanism of connexin 43 gene transfection in the control of glioma cell proliferation ] . OBJECTIVE : To study the mechanism involved in the control of glioma cell proliferation with transfection of connexin ( Cx ) 43 gene . METHODS : P13671 rat glioma and TJ905 human glioblastoma cell lines without P17302 gene expression were transfected with Cx43cDNA mediated by lipofectamine . Northern blot , in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical technology were used to detect the expression of Cx43mRNA and its protein with MTT assay and silver colloid stain for the detection of cell proliferation , TUNEL method for determination of cell apoptosis , scrape loading dye transfer ( SLDT ) for GJIC , Western blot and immunohistochemical technology for P09038 , PDGF , P00533 , P05019 and P17936 expression . RESULTS : Cx 43 gene transfected glioma cells showed decreased proliferation , restored GJIC and decreased P09038 , PDGF , P17936 , except P00533 expression and cell apoptosis which showed no change . CONCLUSION : The mechanism of Cx 43 gene inhibiting gliomas cell proliferation is the restoration of GJIC and decreased autocrine growth factors .
