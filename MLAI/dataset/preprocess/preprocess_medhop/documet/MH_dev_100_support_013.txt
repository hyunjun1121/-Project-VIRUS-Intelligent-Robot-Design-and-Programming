How corticosteroids control inflammation : Quintiles Prize Lecture 2005 . Corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory therapy for many chronic inflammatory diseases , such as asthma but are relatively ineffective in other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . Chronic inflammation is characterised by the increased expression of multiple inflammatory genes that are regulated by proinflammatory transcription factors , such as nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 , that bind to and activate coactivator molecules , which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription . Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory genes that are activated in chronic inflammatory diseases , such as asthma , mainly by reversing histone acetylation of activated inflammatory genes through binding of liganded glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) to coactivators and recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 ( Q92769 ) to the activated transcription complex . At higher concentrations of corticosteroids GR homodimers also interact with DNA recognition sites to active transcription of anti-inflammatory genes and to inhibit transcription of several genes linked to corticosteroid side effects . In patients with P48444 and severe asthma and in asthmatic patients who smoke Q92769 is markedly reduced in activity and expression as a result of oxidative/nitrative stress so that inflammation becomes resistant to the anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids . DB00277 , by activating HDAC , may reverse this corticosteroid resistance . This research may lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory approaches to manage severe inflammatory diseases .
