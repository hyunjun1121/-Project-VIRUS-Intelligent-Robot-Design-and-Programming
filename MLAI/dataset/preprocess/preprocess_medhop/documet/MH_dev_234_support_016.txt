DB09073 ( PD 0332991 ) : targeting the cell cycle machinery in breast cancer . INTRODUCTION : The cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 ( P11802 /6 ) -retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) pathway , governing the cell cycle restriction point , is frequently altered in breast cancer and is a potentially relevant target for anticancer therapy . DB09073 ( PD 0332991 ) , a potent and selective inhibitor of P11802 and Q00534 , inhibits proliferation of several P06400 -positive cancer cell lines and xenograft models . AREAS COVERED : The basic features and abnormalities of the cell cycle in breast cancer are described , along with their involvement in estrogen signaling and endocrine resistance . The pharmacological features of palbociclib , its activity in preclinical models of breast cancer and the potential determinants of response are then illustrated , and its clinical development in breast cancer described . A literature search on the topic was conducted through PubMed and the proceedings of the main cancer congresses of recent years . EXPERT OPINION : The combination of palbociclib with endocrine agents is a very promising treatment and Phase III clinical trials are ongoing to confirm its efficacy . Further , potentially useful combinations are those with drugs targeting mitogenic signaling pathways , such as P04626 - and PI3K-inhibitors . Combination with chemotherapy seems more problematic , as antagonism has been reported in preclinical models . The identification of predictive factors , already explored in preclinical studies , must be further refined and validated in clinical trials .
