Periadventitial adipose tissue impairs coronary endothelial function via P05771 -dependent phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase . Endogenous periadventitial adipose-derived factors have been shown to contribute to coronary vascular regulation by impairing endothelial function through a direct inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) . However , our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains uncertain . Accordingly , this study was designed to test the hypothesis that periadventitial adipose tissue releases agents that attenuate coronary endothelial nitric oxide production via a protein kinase C ( PKC ) -beta-dependent mechanism . Isometric tension studies were conducted on isolated canine circumflex coronary arteries with and without natural amounts of periadventitial adipose tissue . Adipose tissue significantly diminished coronary endothelial-dependent vasodilation and nitric oxide production in response to bradykinin and acetylcholine . The selective inhibition of endothelial P05771 with ruboxistaurin ( 1 microM ) abolished the adipose-induced impairment of bradykinin-mediated coronary vasodilation and the endothelial production of nitric oxide . Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in P29474 phosphorylation at the inhibitory residue DB00156 (495) in arteries exposed to periadventitial adipose tissue . This site-specific phosphorylation of P29474 was prevented by the inhibition of P05771 . These data demonstrate that periadventitial adipose-derived factors impair coronary endothelial nitric oxide production via a P05771 -dependent , site-specific phosphorylation of P29474 at DB00156 (495) .
