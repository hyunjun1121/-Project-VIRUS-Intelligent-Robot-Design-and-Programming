Current researches on breast cancer epidemiology in Korea . As a cause of death in women , breast cancer ranks second to stomach cancer in Korea . Age-standardized mortality rates for breast cancer steadily increased during the 1980s and 1990s . There are big differences in the incidence rates for breast cancer compared with Western countries . Epidemiological features , trends in morbidity and mortality , various age-specific incidence curves , migrant study results , and analysis of the risk factors , however , suggest that the incidence of breast cancer might be further increasing in Korea . The key epidemiological hormonal risk factors for breast cancer are all explicable in terms of the estrogen augmented by progesterone hypothesis . These include older age , family history of breast cancer , early menarche , late menopause , late full-term pregnancy , and never a breast feeding . Both the establishment of high-risk groups and the estimation of lifetime risk are essential to develop a control strategy against breast cancer . Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common histologic type of breast cancer in Korea , and the five-year survival rate has been estimated as 80-83 % . Recent studies on the identification of susceptibility factors such as genetic polymorphisms of P09488 /T1/P1 , P21964 , P05181 , P11511 , P05093 , P03372 , P18887 , O43542 , P43351 , TGF-alpha , P01375 , IL-1B , IL-1RN , P50613 etc. that predispose individuals to breast cancer by gene-environment or gene-gene interactions may possibly give further insight into both the etiology and the prevention of this malignancy .
