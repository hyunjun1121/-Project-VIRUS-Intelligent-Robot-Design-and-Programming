Sex steroid receptors , secondary bile acids and colorectal cancer . A possible mechanism of interaction . AIM : The aim of the work was to study in colon-rectum cancer mucosae the binding charateristics , as sex steroid receptors . METHODS : Specific androgen ( AR ) , estrogen ( ER ) and progesterone ( PgR ) receptors were measured in the tissue samples of 35 patients ( 15 males , 20 females ) undergoing colectomy or coloproctectomy for adenocarcinoma . The characteristics of androgen receptor ( AR , DB02901 -R : dihydrotestosterone receptor ) were also investigated using competitive activity of cyproterone acetate , cortisol , aldosterone and steroid-like substances such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acid , present in the milieu of the considered organ . Binding assays and competition tests were conducted using a charcoal dextran method . RESULTS : When present ( 50 % ) , ER and PgR receptors showed very low levels and no difference was noted between cancerous and the surrounding healthy mucosa . AR were found in all samples from both neoplastic and non neoplastic surrounding mucosa , with no significant difference . P10275 however exhibited an altered binding activity in cancer specimens . DB04839 did not displace DB02901 from AR while significant displacing activity was elicited by DB02901 , testosterone , as well as by lithocholic acid , but not by deoxycholic acid . CONCLUSION : In cancerous large bowel mucosa , androgen receptors show altered binding characteristics . The selective binding of lithocholic acid to AR supports the hypothesis that diet-related endoluminal substances may play a role in cancer development model where molecular alterations such as DNA damage or mutation is the 1st event .
