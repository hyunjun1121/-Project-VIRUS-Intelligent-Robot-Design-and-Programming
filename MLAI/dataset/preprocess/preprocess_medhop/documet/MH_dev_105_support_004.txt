Dermatologic adverse events associated with afatinib : an oral ErbB family blocker . Dermatologic adverse events ( AEs ) are frequently observed in patients receiving P01133 receptor ( P00533 ; also known as ErbB1 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy . The impact of these AEs goes beyond cosmesis to the discomfort from itching , pain and secondary infections , all of which may significantly impact on patient well-being , adherence and clinical outcomes . DB08916 is a potent , irreversible , oral , ErbB family blocker , inhibiting P00533 ( ErbB1 ) , P04626 ( ErbB2 ) and ErbB4 receptor kinases . It also inhibits transphosphorylation of ErbB3 . Similar to P00533 inhibitors , dermatologic AEs have been frequently observed in patients treated with afatinib . Papulopustular ( acneiform ) rash , pruritus , xerosis , paronychia and alopecia will require patient education and proactive treatment interventions . This article summarizes current data on the dermatologic AEs associated with afatinib treatment across the clinical trial program , and provides strategies for their effective management .
