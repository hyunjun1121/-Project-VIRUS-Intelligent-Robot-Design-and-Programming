Rapid regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone gene transcription in vivo . Regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) gene expression in vivo was assessed via in situ hybridization histochemistry , using probes directed against an intronic sequence of the P06850 gene . Initial characterization of the P06850 intron ( CRHin ) probe revealed specific localization of signal to the nuclear compartment of neurons in the medial parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamus , which are known to produce P06850 peptide and mRNA . Abundance of CRHin signal was low , commensurate with a low resting pool of P06850 heteronuclear RNA ( hnRNA ) , representing P06850 primary transcript . Regulation of P06850 hnRNA levels was assessed after acute glucocorticoid synthesis blockade by injection of metyrapone . Metyrapone inhibits the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone , thereby rapidly depleting glucocorticoids and serving as a discrete stimulus for hypothalamo-pituitary-adreno-cortical activation . Plasma hormone measurements verified the efficacy of treatment , as metyrapone-treated rats showed extremely low basal corticosterone levels at all postinjection time points , while exhibiting progressive increases in plasma DB01285 release over the 60-min postinjection period . P06850 hnRNA levels were markedly increased 15-30 min after metyrapone injection , consistent with a rapid induction of P06850 gene transcription in response to the stimulatory event . P06850 mRNA , on the other hand , did not exceed control levels until 60 min post metyrapone , illustrative of a temporal lag between transcriptional changes and detectable changes in mRNA pools . Additional sections from metyrapone-and vehicle-treated rats were hybridized with probes complementary to mRNA encoding the immediate-early gene c-fos . c-fos was not present under unstimulated conditions yet was rapidly induced upon metyrapone treatment or vehicle injection ( 15 min ) .
