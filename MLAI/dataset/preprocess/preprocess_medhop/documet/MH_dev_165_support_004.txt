DB01268 in metastatic thymic carcinomas : laboratory findings and initial clinical experience . BACKGROUND : Thymic carcinoma ( TC ) is a rare aggressive tumour . Median survival with current treatments is only 2 years . DB01268 is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown benefit in various other cancers . METHODS : Laboratory analyses of snap-frozen tumour tissues were performed to detect activation and genetic mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) in TC samples . On the basis of molecular analyses showing activation of multiple RTKs in their tumour , four patients with metastatic TCs refractory to conventional therapies were treated with sunitinib according to standard protocols . RESULTS : RTK analysis in three of the patients showed activation of multiple RTKs , including platelet-derived growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor 3 . Mutations of P00533 , c- P10721 , P01116 , and P15056 genes were not found . Administration of sunitinib yielded a partial remission ( lasting 2 to 18+ months ) according to the RECIST criteria in three patients and stable disease with excellent metabolic response in DB09150 -PET in another one . The overall survival with sunitinib treatment ranges from 4 to 40+ months . Withdrawal of the drug in one patient prompted rapid tumour progression that could be controlled by re-administration of sunitinib . CONCLUSIONS : DB01268 is an active treatment for metastatic TC . A panel of molecular analyses may be warranted for optimal patient selection .
