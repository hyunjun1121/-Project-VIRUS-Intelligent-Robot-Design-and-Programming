Differential in vitro sensitivity to patupilone versus paclitaxel in uterine and ovarian carcinosarcoma cell lines is linked to tubulin-beta-III expression . OBJECTIVE : To compare the in vitro sensitivity/resistance to patupilone versus paclitaxel in uterine and ovarian carcinosarcomas ( CS ) . METHODS : Five primary carcinosarcoma cell lines , two from uterine and three of ovarian origin , were evaluated for growth rate and tested for their in vitro sensitivity/resistance to patupilone versus paclitaxel by MTS assays . To identify potential mechanisms underlying the differential sensitivity/resistance to patupilone , expression levels of Î²-tubulin III ( Q13509 ) were determined with quantitative-real-time-polymerase-chain-reaction ( q-RT-PCR ) in primary uterine and ovarian CS cell lines and in 26 uterine and 9 ovarian CS fresh-frozen-tissues . RESULTS : No appreciable difference in sensitivity to patupilone versus paclitaxel was noted in ovarian CS cell lines , or when uterine and ovarian CS cell lines were compared in their response to paclitaxel . In contrast , uterine CS cell lines were found to be significantly more sensitive to patupilone than to paclitaxel ( P < 0.002 ) and demostrated lower IC(50s) to patupilone ( range 0.76-0.93nM ) when compared to ovarian CS ( range 1.9-3.4 nM , p < 0.05 ) . Higher levels of Q13509 were detected in uterine CS cell lines and fresh frozen tissues when compared to ovarian CS ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Uterine CS cell lines are significantly more sensitive than ovarian CS cell lines to patupilone versus paclitaxel . High expression of Q13509 is associated with sensitivity to patupilone in primary CS cell lines and may act as a genetic marker to predict chemotherapy efficacy . DB03010 may represent a promising drug in the treatment of this subset of rare but highly aggressive gynecological tumors .
