Differences in immune cell function between tuberculosis positive and negative Asian elephants . Tuberculosis is an important health concern for Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus ) populations worldwide , however , mechanisms underlying susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis are unknown . Proliferative responses assessed via brominated uridine incorporation and cytokine expression measured by real-time RT-PCR were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) cultures from 8 tuberculosis negative and 8 positive Asian elephants . Cultures were stimulated with Mycobacterium bovis purified protein derivative ( PPD-B ) , M. tuberculosis culture filtrate protein ( P27918 ) -10 , and Mycobacterium avium PPD ( PPD-A ) . Following stimulation with PPD-B , proliferation was higher ( α = 0.005 ) in positive samples ; no significant differences were detected following P27918 -10 or PPD-A stimulation . P01375 ( P01375 ) -α , interleukin ( IL ) -12 , and interferon ( IFN ) -γ expression was greater in samples from positive elephants following stimulation with PPD-B ( α = 0.025 ) and P27918 -10 ( α = 0.025 P01375 -α and IL-12 ; α = 0.005 IFN-γ ) . Stimulation with PPD-A also produced enhanced IL-12 expression in positive samples ( α = 0.025 ) . Findings suggested that differences in immune cell function exist between tuberculosis positive and negative elephants . Proliferative responses and expression of P01375 -α , IL-12 , and IFN-γ in response to stimulation with PPD-B and P27918 -10 differ between tuberculosis positive and negative elephants , suggesting these parameters may be important to tuberculosis immunopathogenesis in this species .
