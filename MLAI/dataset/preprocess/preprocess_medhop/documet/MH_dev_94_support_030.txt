High-level synthesis of recombinant murine endostatin in Chinese hamster ovary cells . Endostatin , a carboxy-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII , has been shown to act as an anti-angiogenic agent that specifically inhibits proliferation of endothelial cells and growth of various primary tumors . Here , we describe the expression by Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells of murine endostatin and of a tagged-fusion protein , (his)6-met-endostatin . A dicistronic mRNA expression vector was utilized in which endostatin cDNA was inserted upstream of the amplifiable marker gene , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . After transfection of the expression vectors , stepwise increments in methotrexate levels in the culture medium were applied , promoting gene amplification and increasing expression levels of the proteins of interest . The expression level of secreted native endostatin was about 78 microg/mL while the one for secreted (his)6-met-endostatin was about 114 microg/mL , for the best expressing clones . Characterization of physico-chemical and immunological activities of the proteins was performed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting . The biological activities of recombinant endostatins were tested with a cow pulmonary artery endothelial ( C-PAE ) cell proliferation assay . Both recombinant endostatin and (his)6-met-endostatin inhibited , in a dose-dependent fashion , growth of C-PAE cells stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) .
