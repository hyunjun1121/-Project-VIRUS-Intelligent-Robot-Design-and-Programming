Generation of human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies with specificity to the murine monoclonal anti-CA 125 antibody DB04964 . Two human monoclonal antibodies , HID-7E7 and ROB-6F2 , were produced by EBV transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) . PBL were obtained from a patient with ovarian cancer who had been exposed several times to a Tc-99m labeled murine monoclonal anti-CA 125 antibody ( DB04964 , Biomira , Edmonton ) for immunoscintigraphy . The HID-7E7 and ROB-6F2 producing B-cells were cloned with a limiting dilution technique and have shown stable immunoglobulin secretion within a period of three years . The human monoclonal antibodies HID-7E7 and ROB-6F2 are of the IgG isotype , and bind with significant affinity to the murine monoclonal antibody DB04964 , which was used for immunoscintigraphy . Binding affinity of ROB-6F2 to other murine antibodies could not be detected . Cross reactivity of HID-7E7 to a murine anti- P06731 monoclonal antibody was observed . In order to verify the anti-idiotypic character of the generated human antibodies , the ability of HID-7E7 and ROB-6F2 , respectively , to inhibit the formation of the Q8WXI7 / DB04964 complex is demonstrated via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . These human anti-idiotypic antibodies are possible candidates for immunotherapy of ovarian cancer in patients with a small tumor burden following surgery and/or chemotherapy .
