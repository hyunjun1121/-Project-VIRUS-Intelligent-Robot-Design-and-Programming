DB04866 suppresses the lung metastasis of chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma in rats through MMP inhibition . DB04866 , an inhibitor of collagen synthesis , appears to be a promising antitumoral drug in preclinical studies . We used a relevant rat model of autochthonous , chemically induced , spontaneously metastasizing hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) to test the efficacy of halofuginone on tumor progression and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) expression . Following sequential administration of diethylnitrosamine and N-nitrosomorpholine for 14 weeks , all animals developed HCC and then received halofuginone or its solvent for 10 weeks . The final number of liver tumors was lower in the halofuginone group than in the solvent group ( 57.2 +/- 4.6 vs 68 +/- 5.0 ; P < .01 ) . The percentage of the lung surface infiltrated by metastasis was much smaller in the halofuginone group ( 0.3 +/- 0.2 % ) than in the solvent group ( 13.5 +/- 10.1 % ; P < .02 ) . P14780 activity was decreased in the halofuginone group by 89 % and 63 % in non-neoplastic parts of the liver and tumor , respectively . The percentage of active P08253 was reduced by 90 % in non-neoplastic parts of the liver and by 61 % in tumors . This was likely subsequent to a decreased expression of both P50281 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 , which are required for pro- P08253 activation . These results , obtained from a clinically relevant model , further suggest the potential benefit of halofuginone in HCC .
