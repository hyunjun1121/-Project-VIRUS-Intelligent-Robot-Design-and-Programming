Sporadic fundic gland polyps : an immunohistochemical study of their antigenic profile . Fundic Gland Polyps ( FGPs ) are small sessile ( 2-5 mm ) , usually multiple polyps arising in the gastric , acid-secreting mucosa of disputed histogenesis . They have been described in a sporadic form , prevalently in middle aged females , or associated with familial adenomatosis coli-Gardner 's syndrome . We performed an immunohistochemical study on 24 sporadic FGPs , using monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) against differentiation markers , class II MHC antigens ( HLA-DR ) , oncofetal and proliferation antigens , aimed to characterize the antigenic profile of the polyps . A preliminary cytogenetic study on five polyps was also done , using an in situ culture method after collagenase treatment . Cytokeratins 8-18 ( P62158 5.2 MAb ) and 20 ( IT-Ks 20.8 MAb ) , Epithelial Membrane Antigen ( P15941 ) and Chromogranin A were normally expressed by FGPs . FGPs did not express HLA II DR . FGPs did not react with an anti- P06731 MAb ( F6 ) , but they were frequently positive ( 22/24 , 91.6 % ) with B72.3 MAb ( reacting with the cancer-associated mucin epitope sialyl-Tn ) . The PC10 MAb ( against P12004 or cyclin ) showed enhanced expression in the deep glandular-cystic compartment of FGPs ; the P12004 index of FGPs was significantly higher than in normal fundic mucosa . The cytogenetic study on the 5 cases analysed , revealed a normal karyotype . We have demonstrated that FGPs express in the paranuclear zone the sialyl-Tn epitope , a side-chain sugar normally masqued in adult gastric mucins , thus revealing an alteration in mucin synthesis ; FGPs ' higher proliferation index as compared with normal fundic mucosa supports the hypothesis of their hyperproliferative nature .
