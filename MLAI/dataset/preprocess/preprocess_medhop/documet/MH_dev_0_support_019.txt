New obesity agents : lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the evidence for lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate in the treatment of obesity . DATA SOURCES : Literature was accessed through PubMed ( June 1975-March 2013 ) using the search terms lorcaserin , phentermine , topiramate , or phenter mine/topiramate . Additionally , reference citations from publications identified were reviewed . Additional information was obtained from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved prescribing information and FDA briefing documents . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION : English-language articles focusing on Phase 3 clinical trials for obesity were critiqued . Data from preclinical and Phase 1 and/or 2 trials are reported when appropriate . Six prospective Phase 3 trials were reviewed . DATA SYNTHESIS : Obesity has reached epidemic proportions , affecting more than one third of adults in the US . Two medication products , lorcaserin and phenter mine/topiramate , have recently received FDA approval as adjuncts to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity among individuals with a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2) or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m(2) with an obesity-related comorbidity , such as hypertension , dyslipidemia , or diabetes . DB04871 is a selective serotonin P28335 agonist that regulates food intake , while the combination of phentermine/topiramate causes appetite suppression and enhanced satiety . Three Phase 3 randomized , placebo-controlled trials reported approximately 75 % and 45 % of patients achieved greater than or equal to 5 % weight loss with phentermine/topiramate and lorcaserin , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : With lifestyle modification , phentermine/topiramate appears most effective in terms of weight loss . DB04871 demonstrates moderate efficacy . Long-term cardiovascular outcomes studies are needed to confirm the safety and benefit of these new obesity agents .
