New isoflavonoids as inhibitors of porcine P09917 . The inhibitory activity of new isoflavonoids on P09917 of porcine leukocytes was investigated . Isoflavans ( I ) proved to be stronger inhibitors than isoflavones ( II ) . The isoflavans containing ortho-hydroxy groups in ring A showed the lowest Ki values ( 0.8-50 microM ) . In comparison , isoflavans with meta-dihydroxy groups exhibited Ki values higher than 150 microM . The effect of commercial antioxidants was tested also on porcine P09917 . Butylated hydroxyanisole ( Ki : 25 microM ) and butylated hydroxytoluene ( Ki : 55 microM ) revealed moderate inhibitory activity , whereas L-ascorbic acid , L-ascorbyl palmitate , dl- DB00163 and n-propyl gallate showed weak inhibitory activities ( Ki : 100-260 microM ) .
