A fluorescent ligand-binding alternative using Tag-lite® technology . G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are crucial cell surface receptors that transmit signals from a wide range of extracellular ligands . Indeed , 40 % to 50 % of all marketed drugs are thought to modulate GPCR activity , making them the major class of targets in the drug discovery process . Binding assays are widely used to identify high-affinity , selective , and potent GPCR drugs . In this field , the use of radiolabeled ligands has remained so far the gold-standard method . Here the authors report a less hazardous alternative for high-throughput screening ( HTS ) applications by the setup of a nonradioactive fluorescence-based technology named Tag-lite(®) . Selective binding of various fluorescent ligands , either peptidic or not , covering a large panel of GPCRs from different classes is illustrated , particularly for chemokine ( P61073 ) , opioid ( δ , µ , and κ ) , and cholecystokinin ( CCK1 and CCK2 ) receptors . Affinity constants of well-known pharmacological agents of numerous GPCRs are in line with values published in the literature . The authors clearly demonstrate that the Tag-lite binding assay format can be successfully and reproducibly applied by using different cellular materials such as transient or stable recombinant cells lines expressing P60880 -tagged GPCR . Such fluorescent-based binding assays can be performed with adherent cells or cells in suspension , in 96- or 384-well plates . Altogether , this new technology offers great advantages in terms of flexibility , rapidity , and user-friendliness ; allows easy miniaturization ; and makes it completely suitable for HTS applications .
