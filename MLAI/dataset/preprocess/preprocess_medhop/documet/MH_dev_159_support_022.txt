DB01017 exerts multiple inhibitory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration : the role of P27361 /2 , PI3K , and matrix metalloproteinases . Widely used tetracycline antibiotics affect many cellular functions relevant to human vascular disease including cell proliferation , migration , and matrix remodeling . We examined whether minocycline inhibited human aortic smooth muscle cell ( HASMC ) migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . After the establishment of an optimal dose , minocycline treated HASMC were exposed to P15692 . HASMC migration , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 and P14780 activities , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) phosphorylation were determined by smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) invasion assay , real-time polymerase chain reaction , zymograms , and Western blot analysis , respectively . We demonstrated that P15692 and platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -induced SMC migration in a dose-dependent manner . P14780 , but not P08253 , mRNA was increased during P15692 stimulation . P14780 activity was increased from 1.5- to 2.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner ( P < 0.05 ) . Both P27361 /2 and PI3K/AKt pathways were activated during P15692 -induced HASMCs migration . We then demonstrated that minocycline can inhibit P15692 -induced HASMC migration ( P < 0.05 ) . The effects may be through the inhibition of P14780 mRNA transcription , protein activities and downregulation of P27361 /2 and PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylation . Our results indicated that minocycline exerts multiple effects on P15692 -induced SMC migration , including inhibition of P14780 mRNA transcription and protein activities and downregulating P27361 /2 and PI3K signal pathways , suggesting minocycline may be a potentially therapeutic approach to inhibit disease process induced angiogenesis .
