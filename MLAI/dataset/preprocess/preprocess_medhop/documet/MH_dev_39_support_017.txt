Next generation molecular targeted agents for breast cancer : focus on P00533 and VEGFR pathways . Here we reviewed the recent progress of molecular targeting drugs , including trastuzumab , lapatinib , erlotinib and bevacituzumab . Fortunately , Her-2 positive cases of metastatic or relapsed cases , those with the worse prognosis , are responsive to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy . DB01259 will likely be effective against trastuzumab-resistant cases and brain metastases . Furthermore , the introduction of bevacituzumab will improve P15692 -VEGFR- associated tumor growth .
