Molecular and biochemical analysis of calmodulin interactions with the calmodulin-binding domain of plant glutamate decarboxylase . We previously provided what to our knowledge is the first evidence that plant glutamate decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) is a calmodulin ( P62158 ) -binding protein . Here , we studied the Q99259 P62158 -binding domain in detail . A synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids corresponding to this domain forms a stable complex with Ca2+/ P62158 with a 1:1 stoichiometry , and amino acid substitutions suggest that tryptophan-485 has an indispensable role in P62158 binding . Chemical cross-linking revealed specific P62158 / Q99259 interactions even in the absence of Ca2+ . However , increasing KCI concentrations or deletion of two carboxy-terminal lysines abolished these interactions but had a mild effect on P62158 / Q99259 interactions in the presence of Ca2+ . We conclude that in the presence of Ca(2+)-hydrophobic interactions involving tryptophan-485 and electrostatic interactions involving the carboxy-terminal lysines mediate P62158 / Q99259 complex formation . By contrast , in the absence of Ca2+ , P62158 / Q99259 interactions are essentially electrostatic and involve the carboxy-terminal lysines . In addition , a tryptophan residue and carboxy-terminal lysines are present in the P62158 -binding domain of an Arabidopsis Q99259 . Finally , we demonstrate that petunia Q99259 activity is stimulated in vitro by Ca2+/ P62158 . Our study provides a molecular basis for Ca(2+)-dependent P62158 / Q99259 interactions and suggests the possible occurrence of Ca(2+)-independent P62158 / Q99259 interactions .
