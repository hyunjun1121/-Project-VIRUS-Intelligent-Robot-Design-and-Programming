Characterization of the pattern of the nongenomic signaling pathway through which TCDD-induces early inflammatory responses in U937 human macrophages . 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin ( TCDD ) has been known to induce inflammatory signaling in a number of cell types and tissues . We found that in U937 macrophages TCDD causes rapid activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) within 30min as judged by the increase in the serine 505 phosphorylated form of P47712 protein and the increased cellular release of free arachidonic acid . This initial action of TCDD is accompanied with the up-regulation of an important inflammation marker , P35354 mRNA expression within 1h , and by 3h , several other markers become up-regulated . These effects appear to be dependent on the initial increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) , and activation of P47712 and P35354 . A comparative study among three different human cell lines showed that activation of P35354 within 1h of action of TCDD is a common feature exhibited by all cell lines . On the other hand , the U937 macrophage line appears to be unique among them with respect to its ability to activate P01375 and P10145 mRNA expressions , and not requiring Src kinase in propagating the initial signaling of P47712 . Based on the rapidity of activation of P47712 and P35354 , which occurs within 1h of cell exposure to TCDD , when no change in mRNA expression of P04798 has been observed , it is apparent that this unique action of TCDD is carried out through a distinct " nongenomic " pathway which , is clearly discernable from the classical , " genomic " action pathway of the P35869 by not requiring the participation of P27540 .
