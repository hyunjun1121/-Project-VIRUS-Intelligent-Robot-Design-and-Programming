The Drosophila insulin receptor activates multiple signaling pathways but requires insulin receptor substrate proteins for DNA synthesis . The Drosophila insulin receptor ( P30518 ) contains a 368-amino-acid COOH-terminal extension that contains several tyrosine phosphorylation sites in YXXM motifs . This extension is absent from the human insulin receptor but resembles a region in insulin receptor substrate ( P41252 ) proteins which binds to the phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3-kinase and mediates mitogenesis . The function of a chimeric P30518 containing the human insulin receptor binding domain ( hDIR ) was investigated in 32D cells , which contain few insulin receptors and no P41252 proteins . P01308 stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of the human insulin receptor and hDIR , and both receptors mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase . P35568 was required by the human insulin receptor to activate PI 3-kinase and p70s6k , whereas hDIR associated with PI 3-kinase and activated p70s6k without P35568 . However , both receptors required P35568 to mediate insulin-stimulated mitogenesis . These data demonstrate that the P30518 possesses additional signaling capabilities compared with its mammalian counterpart but still requires P35568 for the complete insulin response in mammalian cells .
