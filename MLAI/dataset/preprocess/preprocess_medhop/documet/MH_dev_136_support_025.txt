Bypassing tumor-specific and bispecific antibodies : triggering of antitumor immunity by expression of anti-FcgammaR scFv on cancer cell surface . We have developed a novel immunostimulatory molecule against tumor cells , composed of an anti-FcgammaRIII ( CD16 ) scFv fused to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) transmembrane region . This fusion molecule was stably expressed on the tumor cell surface and retained the ability of the parental antibody to bind soluble CD16 . Tumor cells expressing anti-CD16 scFv triggered the release of P60568 by Jurkat-CD 16/gamma cells and of TNFalpha by monocytes when co-cultured with these cells . Furthermore , NK cells could kill scFv-transfected HLA+ class I H1299 lung carcinoma tumor cells , but not the parental cells , indicating that anti-CD16 scFv tumor expression prevents the killer inhibitory receptor ( P55040 ) -mediated inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity . This anti-CD16 scFv tumor expression also enhanced tumor phagocytosis by IFNgamma-activated macrophages , a mechanism known to induce a protective long-term adaptative immunity to tumors . In vivo Winn tests performed in SCID mice showed that the expression of anti-CD16 scFv on tumor cells , but not of the negative control anti-phOx scFv , prevented tumor cell growth . Thus , expression of FcR antibodies or other FcR-specific ligands on tumor cells represents a novel and potent antibody-based gene therapy approach , which may have clinical applications in cancer
