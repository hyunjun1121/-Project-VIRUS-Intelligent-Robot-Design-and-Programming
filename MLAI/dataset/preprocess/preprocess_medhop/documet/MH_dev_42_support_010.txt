DB00398 inhibits imatinib-resistant P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta gatekeeper mutants . PURPOSE : Targeting of P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) tyrosine kinases by imatinib is an effective anticancer strategy . However , mutations of the gatekeeper residue ( T670 in P10721 and T681 in PDGFRbeta ) render the two kinases resistant to imatinib . The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) , a multitargeted DB00171 -competitive inhibitor of P10721 and P09619 , was active against imatinib-resistant P10721 and PDGFRbeta kinases . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We used in vitro kinase assays and immunoblot with phosphospecific antibodies to determine the activity of sorafenib on P10721 and PDGFRbeta kinases . We also exploited reporter luciferase assays to measure the effects of sorafenib on P10721 and PDGFRbeta downstream signaling events . The activity of sorafenib on interleukin-3-independent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 cells expressing oncogenic P10721 or its imatinib-resistant T670I mutant was also tested . RESULTS : DB00398 efficiently inhibited gatekeeper mutants of P10721 and PDGFRbeta ( IC(50) for P10721 T670I , 60 nmol/L ; IC(50) for PDGFRbeta T681I , 110 nmol/L ) . Instead , it was less active against activation loop mutants of the two receptors ( IC(50) for P10721 D816V , 3.8 micromol/L ; IC(50) for PDGFRbeta D850V , 1.17 micromol/L ) that are also imatinib-resistant . DB00398 blocked receptor autophosphorylation and signaling of P10721 and PDGFRbeta gatekeeper mutants in intact cells as well as activation of P05412 -responsive and cyclin D1 gene promoters , respectively . Finally , the compound inhibited P10721 -dependent proliferation of Ba/ P13726 cells expressing the oncogenic P10721 mutant carrying the T670I mutation . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 might be a promising anticancer agent for patients carrying P10721 and PDGFRbeta gatekeeper mutations .
