Expression of Th2-skewed pathology mediators in monocyte-derived type 2 of dendritic cells ( DC2 ) . The information conveyed from dendritic cells ( DCs ) to naïve P01730 (+) T cells has crucial influence on their differentiation toward effector T cells . In an effort to identify DC-derived molecules directly contributing to T cell differentiation , we searched for molecules distinctively expressed between two DC subtypes , which were differentiated from peripheral monocytes by cultivation with GM- P04141 ( for Q9NPG8 ) or P08700 ( for DC2 ) in the presence of P05112 and had the ability to induce naïve T cells to differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells , respectively . As the first step to address this issue , we subtracted Q9NPG8 transcripts from those of DC2 and compiled the gene profile dominantly expressed in DC2 , whose products are known to reside in other than the nucleus . Intriguingly , many of them were molecules involved in Th2-skewed disease pathologies , such as P02751 , P38570 , Q14956 , Q03405 , P25089 , Q8NHJ6 , P05121 , P16050 , P24557 , P19878 , P10147 , P18510 , P09486 , and Q9NY15 , suggesting that DCs function not only as antigen presenting cells but also as producers of Th2 pathology specific milieus leading to disease deteriorations . We also found that expressions of Q02318 , O14495 , Q8WXG1 , and O15438 were up-regulated in DC2 , implying their significant function in Th2-deviated states . The identification of differentially expressed genes between DC subtypes provides new insights into their functions and our comparative gene expression profile will be highly useful for the identification of DC-derived key molecules for T cell differentiation .
