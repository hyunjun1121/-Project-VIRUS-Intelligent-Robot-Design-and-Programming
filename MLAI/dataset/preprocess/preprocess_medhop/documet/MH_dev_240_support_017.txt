Clinical pharmacology of novel selective P35354 inhibitors . Novel coxibs ( i.e. etoricoxib , valdecoxib , parecoxib and lumiracoxib ) with enhanced biochemical cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 selectivity over that of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been recently developed . They have the potential advantage to spare P23219 activity , thus reducing gastrointestinal toxicity , even when administered at high doses to improve efficacy . They are characterized by different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics features . The higher biochemical selectivity of valdecoxib than celecoxib , evidenced in vitro , may be clinically relevant leading to an improved gastrointestinal safety . Interestingly , parecoxib , a pro-drug of valdecoxib , is the only injectable coxib . DB01628 shows only a slightly improved P35354 selectivity than rofecoxib , a highly selective P35354 inhibitor that has been reported to halve the incidence of serious gastrointestinal toxicity compared to nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) . DB01283 , the most selective P35354 inhibitor in vitro , is the only acidic coxib . The hypothesis that this chemical property may lead to an increased and persistent drug accumulation in inflammatory sites and consequently to an improved clinical efficacy , however , remains to be verified . Several randomized clinical studies suggest that the novel coxibs have comparable efficacy to nonselective NSAIDs in the treatment of osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain , but they share similar renal side-effects . The apparent dose-dependence of renal toxicity may limit the use of higher doses of the novel coxibs for improved efficacy . Large-size randomized clinical trials are ongoing to define the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of the novel coxibs .
