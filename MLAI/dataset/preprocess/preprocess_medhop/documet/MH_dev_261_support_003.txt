Poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism in X-irradiated Chinese hamster cells : its relation to repair of potentially lethal damage . DB02701 -adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) is the substrate used by cells in poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis . X-irradiation of log-phase Chinese hamster cells caused a rapid decrease in NAD+ levels which was linearly dependent on radiation dose . The activity of ADP-ribosyl transferase ( P09874 ) also increased linearly with radiation dose . The decrease of NAD+ was slower , and the increase in P09874 activity was less pronounced , in a radiation sensitive line , V79- AL162 /S-10 . An inhibitor of P09874 , m-aminobenzamide , largely prevented the depletion of cellular NAD+ and reduced the rate at which P09874 activity disappeared during post-irradiation incubation . Post-irradiation treatment with hypertonic buffer or with medium containing D2O -- which inhibit repair of radiation-induced potentially lethal damage -- enhanced the depletion of NAD+ and prevented the reduction in P09874 activity following irradiation . The characteristics of the effects of treatment with hypertonic buffer on NAD+ metabolism were qualitatively similar to the effects that such treatment has on radiation-induced cell killing . These results suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis after irradiation plays a role in the repair of potentially lethal damage .
