DB08895 in kidney transplantation . INTRODUCTION : This review will discuss the mechanism of action and important kidney transplant clinical trial data for the small molecule Janus kinase ( JAK ) 3 inhibitor tofacitinib , formerly known as CP-690,550 and tasocitinib . AREAS COVERED : Successful kidney transplantation requires adequate immunosuppression . Current maintenance immunosuppressive protocols which rely on calcineurin inhibitors have long-term nephrotoxicity and negative impact on cardiometabolic risk factors . JAKs are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that participate in the signaling of a broad range of cell surface receptors , particularly members of the cytokine receptor common gamma ( cÎ³ ) chain family . P52333 inhibition has immunosuppressive effects and treatment with tofacitinib in clinical trials has demonstrated efficacy in autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . Nonhuman primate models of renal transplantation demonstrated prolonged graft survival with tofacitinib compared to control . Renal transplant clinical trials in humans have demonstrated tofacitinib to be noninferior to cyclosporine in terms of rejection rates and graft survival . There was also a lower rate of new onset diabetes after transplant . However , there was a trend toward more infections , including cytomegalovirus and BK virus nephritis . EXPERT OPINION : DB08895 may be a promising alternative to calcineurin inhibitors . The optimal therapeutic window is still being determined .
