Estrogen in the limbic system . DB00286 are a group of steroid hormones that function as the primary female sex hormone . DB00286 not only have an important role in the regulation of the estrous or menstrual cycle but also control , for example , bone formation , the cardiovascular system , and cognitive functions . Estradiol ( E2 ) , the main representative of the group , is highly lipophylic and can easily pass the blood-brain barrier to modulate neuronal activity . Particularly the limbic system , a group of tightly interconnected forebrain areas controlling mood and emotion , is rich in estrogen receptors . To date two cytoplasmatic and/or nuclear estrogen receptors named P03372 ( ERalpha ) and Q92731 ( ERbeta ) have been identified . In the brain , ERalpha plays a critical role in regulating reproductive neuroendocrine behavior and function . ERbeta appears to play an important role in nonreproductive behaviors , such as learning and memory , anxiety , and mood . Five splice variants of ERbeta , named Erb1 , Erb2 , Erb1d3 , Erb2d3 , and Erb1d4 , have been identified with possibly different biological activities . There is evidence of a thus far not definitely characterized membrane-linked ER receptor named Q99527 -X . In this review , the anatomy of the limbic system and the distribution of estrogen receptors ( ERs ) are described in relation to coping with stress and the higher prevalence of stress-related psychiatric disorders in women . Effects of cyclic estrogen administration and chronic stress on recovery and neuronal plasticity are illustrated with own results .
