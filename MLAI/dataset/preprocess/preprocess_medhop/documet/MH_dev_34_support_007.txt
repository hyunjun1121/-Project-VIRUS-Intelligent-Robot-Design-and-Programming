A DNA hypermethylation profile reveals new potential biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis . BACKGROUND : DNA hypermethylation has emerged as a novel molecular biomarker for the evaluation of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis . Defining the specific gene hypermethylation profile for prostate cancer could involve groups of genes that specifically discriminate patients with indolent and aggressive tumors . METHODS : Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 83 tumor and 10 normal prostate samples using the GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I ( Illumina , Inc. ) . All clinical stages of disease were considered . RESULTS : We found 41 genes hypermethylated in more than 20 % of the tumors analyzed ( P < 0.01 ) . Of these , we newly identified P28161 and P01210 as being genes that are hypermethylated in prostate cancer and that were simultaneously methylated in 40.9 % of the tumors analyzed . We also identified panels of genes that are more frequently methylated in tumor samples with clinico-pathological indicators of poor prognosis : a high Gleason score , elevated Ki-67 , and advanced disease . Of these , we found simultaneous hypermethylation of P13569 and P28222 to be common in patients with a high Gleason score and high Ki-67 levels ; this might indicate the population at higher risk of therapeutic failure . The DNA hypermethylation profile was associated with cancer-specific mortality ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) and biochemical recurrence-free survival ( log-rank test , P = 0.0008 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings strongly indicate that epigenetic silencing of P28161 and P01210 is a common event in prostate cancer that could be used as a molecular marker for prostate cancer diagnosis . In addition , simultaneous P28222 and P13569 hypermethylation could help discriminate aggressive from indolent prostate tumors .
