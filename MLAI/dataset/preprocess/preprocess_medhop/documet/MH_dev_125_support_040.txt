Spin trapping agent phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone prevents diisopropylphosphorofluoridate-induced excitotoxicity in skeletal muscle of the rat . Indirect evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) may mediate muscle fiber necrosis following muscle hyperactivity induced by the anticholinesterase diisopropylphosphorofluoridate ( DB00677 ) . Pronounced muscle fasciculations and muscle fiber necrosis were seen when acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) activity was reduced to less than 30 % of control . The spin trapping agent phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone ( PBN ) was used in vivo to directly assess the formation of ROS during DB00677 ( 1.75 mg/kg , s.c. ) induced muscle hyperactivity . Pretreatment with PBN ( 300 mg/kg , i.p. ) , the concentration necessary for in vivo spin trapping , prevented muscle hyperactivity as well as necrosis and attenuated the DB00677 induced P22303 inhibition otherwise seen in DB00677 only treated rats . PBN had no effect when given after fasciculations were established . Muscle extracts from PBN and DB00677 treated rats subjected to electron spin resonance ( P03372 ) spectroscopy tested negative for ROS . While the role of PBN as an antioxidant is well established , its prophylactic effect against excitotoxity induced by an P22303 inhibitor are due to its protection of P22303 , an unexpected non-antioxidant action .
