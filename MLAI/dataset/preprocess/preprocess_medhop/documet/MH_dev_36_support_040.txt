Identification of novel genetic alterations in samples of malignant glioma patients . Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant human brain tumor . High level of genomic instability detected in glioma cells implies that numerous genetic alterations accumulate during glioma pathogenesis . We investigated alterations in AP-PCR DNA profiles of 30 glioma patients , and detected specific changes in 11 genes not previously associated with this disease : Q86UP9 , Q13326 , Q13639 , P05556 , P31327 , P07225 , P55259 , Q9UJ96 , Q08499 , Q8N743 , and Q14642 . Further correlations revealed that 8 genes might play important role in pathogenesis of glial tumors , while changes in P55259 , Q9UJ96 and Q8N743 should be considered as passenger mutations , consequence of high level of genomic instability . Identified genes have a significant role in signal transduction or cell adhesion , which are important processes for cancer development and progression . According to our results , Q86UP9 might be characteristic of primary glioblastoma , Q13326 , Q13639 , P05556 , P31327 , P07225 and Q14642 were detected predominantly in anaplastic astrocytoma , suggesting their role in progression of secondary glioblastoma , while alterations of Q08499 seem to have important role in development of both glioblastoma subtypes . Some of the identified genes showed significant association with p53 , p16 , and P00533 , but there was no significant correlation between loss of P60484 and any of identified genes . In conclusion our study revealed genetic alterations that were not previously associated with glioma pathogenesis and could be potentially used as molecular markers of different glioblastoma subtypes .
