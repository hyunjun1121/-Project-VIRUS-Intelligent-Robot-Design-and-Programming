Response of chondrocytes to shear stress : antagonistic effects of the binding partners O00206 and caveolin-1 . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) is often a consequence of excessive mechanical loading of cartilage , which produces hydrostatic stress , tensile strain , and fluid flow . Application of high fluid shear to chondrocytes recapitulates the earmarks of OA , as evidenced by the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 , prostaglandins ( PGs ) , and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) . Here , we delineated the signaling pathway by which high fluid shear mediates the temporal regulation of P05231 synthesis in human chondrocytes . We determined that O00206 ( O00206 ) and caveolin-1 are binding partners in chondrocytes . Their expression is temporally regulated by fluid shear via the sequential up-regulation of microsomal PGE synthase-1 ( mPGES-1 ) and L-PGDS . High shear stress rapidly induces an 8-fold up-regulation of O00206 expression via an mPGES-1-dependent pathway , whereas prolonged shear exposure concurrently down-regulates O00206 by > 4-fold and up-regulates caveolin-1 expression by > 2.5-fold in an L-PGDS-dependent manner . O00206 and caveolin-1 exert opposing effects on the activation of P27361 /2 , P19957 -K and PKA signaling pathways , which , in turn , regulate the NF-ÎºB-dependent P05231 synthesis in a time-dependent fashion . Reconstructing the signaling network regulating shear-induced P05231 expression in chondrocytes may provide insights for developing therapeutic strategies to combat osteoarthritis .
