P21917 signaling in the rat paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus : Evidence of natural coupling involving immediate early gene induction and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphorylation . The dopamine D4 receptor has been investigated for its potential role in several CNS disorders , notably schizophrenia and more recently , erectile dysfunction . Whereas studies have investigated dopamine D4 receptor-mediated signaling in vitro , there have been few , if any , attempts to identify dopamine D4 receptor signal transduction pathways in vivo . In the present studies , the selective dopamine D4 agonist PD168077 induces c-Fos expression and extracellular signal regulated kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) , a site known to regulate proerectile activity . The selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist A-381393 blocked both c-Fos expression and P27361 /2 phosphorylation produced by PD168077 . In addition , PD168077-induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation was prevented by SL327 , an inhibitor of P27361 /2 phosphorylation . Interestingly , treatment with A-381393 alone significantly reduced the amount of Fos immunoreactivity as compared to basal expression observed in vehicle-treated controls . P21917 and c-Fos coexpression in the PVN was observed using double immunohistochemical labeling , suggesting that PD168077-induced signaling may result from direct dopamine D4 receptor activation . Our results demonstrate functional dopamine D4 receptor expression and natural coupling in the PVN linked to signal transduction pathways that include immediate early gene and Q96HU1 kinase activation . Further , the ability of the selective dopamine D4 antagonist A-381393 alone to reduce c-Fos expression below control levels may imply the presence of a tonic dopamine D4 receptor activation under basal conditions in vivo . These findings provide additional evidence that the PVN may be a site of dopamine D4 receptor-mediated proerectile activity .
