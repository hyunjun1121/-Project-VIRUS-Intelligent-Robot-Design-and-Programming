DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor : Prognostic biomarker for endometrial cancer . Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States . However , reliable diagnostic or prognostic tumor markers have not been identified for endometrial cancer . In this study , we examined whether urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein , is a candidate diagnostic or prognostic marker for patients with cancer of the endometrium . Sixty-five surgically excised , formalin-fixed endometrial tissue specimens were accessioned through the Department of Pathology Registry at the University of California , Los Angeles , and analyzed for Q03405 expression by using immunohistochemical techniques . A retrospective review was also performed to determine stage and histopathologic grade of disease , recurrence , and mortality . No expression of Q03405 protein was present in seven patients with benign neoplasia of the endometrium . Q03405 protein expression highly correlated with stage of disease ( ungrouped Spearman correlation = 0.625 , P < 0.0001 ) : 40 % of patients with stage I , 66 % of patients with stage II , 100 % of patients with stage III , and 85 % with stage IV demonstrated the highest level of Q03405 expression . Moreover , high Q03405 expression positively correlated with grade of disease ( ungrouped Spearman correlation = 0.71 , P < 0.0001 ) : 29 % of grade 1 specimens , 57 % of grade 2 , and over 90 % of specimens with grade 3 , the majority representing uterine papillary serous carcinoma and mixed malignant mesodermal tumor . Finally , Q03405 protein expression also positively correlated with rate of recurrence and mortality in patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium ( ungrouped P = 0.034 ) . Our data suggest that Q03405 is a useful prognostic marker for biologically aggressive forms of endometrial cancer .
