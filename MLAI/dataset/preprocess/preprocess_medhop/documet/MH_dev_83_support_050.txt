Inhibition of delayed rectifier potassium channels and induction of arrhythmia : a novel effect of celecoxib and the mechanism underlying it . Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , such as rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) , celecoxib ( DB00482 ) , and valdecoxib ( Bextra ) , have been developed for treating arthritis and other musculoskeletal complaints . Selective inhibition of P35354 over P23219 results in preferential decrease in prostacyclin production over thromboxane A2 production , thus leading to less gastric effects than those seen with nonselective P36551 inhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) . Here we show a novel effect of celecoxib via a mechanism that is independent of P35354 inhibition . The drug inhibited the delayed rectifier ( Kv2 ) potassium channels from Drosophila , rats , and humans and led to pronounced arrhythmia in Drosophila heart and arrhythmic beating of rat heart cells in culture . These effects occurred despite the genomic absence of cyclooxygenases in Drosophila and the failure of acetylsalicylic acid , a potent inhibitor of both P23219 and P35354 , to inhibit rat Kv2.1 channels . A genetically null mutant of Drosophila Shab ( Kv2 ) channels reproduced the cardiac effect of celecoxib , and the drug was unable to further enhance the effect of the mutation . These observations reveal an unanticipated effect of celecoxib on Drosophila hearts and on heart cells from rats , implicating the inhibition of Kv2 channels as the mechanism underlying this effect .
