Bradykinin-induced P05231 expression through bradykinin B2 receptor , phospholipase C , protein kinase Cdelta and NF-kappaB pathway in human synovial fibroblasts . Bradykinin ( BK ) is an inflammatory mediator , and shows elevated levels in regions of severe injury and inflammatory diseases . It has been shown to induce interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) expression in inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis . We investigated the signaling pathway involved in P05231 production caused by BK in synovial fibroblasts . BK caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in P05231 production . By using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibition of the BK receptor , siRNA revealed that B2 but not B1 BK receptors are involved in BK-mediated up-regulation of P05231 . BK-mediated P05231 production was attenuated by phospholipase C inhibitor ( U73122 ) , protein kinase Cdelta inhibitor ( rottlerin ) , NF-kappaB inhibitor ( PDTC ) , IkappaB protease inhibitor ( TPCK ) and NF-kappaB inhibitor peptide . Stimulation of synovial fibroblasts with BK activated O15111 alpha/beta ( IKK alpha/beta ) , P25963 phosphorylation , P25963 degradation , p65 phosphorylation at DB00133 (276) , p65 and p50 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus and kappaB-luciferase activity . BK mediated an increase of IKK alpha/beta and P25963 phosphorylation , kappaB-luciferase activity and p65 and p50 binding to the NF-kappaB element was inhibited by B2 BK receptor antagonist ( HOE140 ) , U73122 and rottlerin . Our results suggest that BK increased P05231 production in synovial fibroblasts via the B2 BK receptor/PI- P98160 /PKCdelta/and NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
