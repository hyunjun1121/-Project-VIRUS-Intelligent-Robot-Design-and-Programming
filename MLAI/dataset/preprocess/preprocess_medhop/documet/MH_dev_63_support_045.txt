DB11320 stimulates hydrogen peroxide production by bronchial epithelial cells via histamine H1 receptor and dual oxidase . Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma . Besides granulocytes , the airway epithelium can produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species and can contribute to asthma-related oxidative stress . DB11320 is a major inflammatory mediator present in large quantities in asthmatic airways . Whether histamine triggers epithelium-derived oxidative stress is unknown . We therefore aimed at characterizing human airway epithelial H2O2 production stimulated by histamine . We found that air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchial epithelial cells ( BECs ) and an immortalized BEC model ( Cdk4/hTERT HBEC ) produce H2O2 in response to histamine . The main source of airway epithelial H2O2 is an NADPH dual oxidase , Duox1 . Out of the four histamine receptors ( P35367 - Q9H3N8 ) , P35367 has the highest expression in BECs and mediates the H2O2-producing effects of histamine . P05112 induces Duox1 gene and protein expression levels and enhances histamine-induced H2O2 production by epithelial cells . Using P29320 -293 cells expressing Duox1 or Duox2 and endogenous P35367 , histamine triggers an immediate intracellular calcium signal and H2O2 release . Overexpression of P35367 further increases the oxidative output of Duox-expressing P29320 -293 cells . Our observations show that BECs respond to histamine with Duox-mediated H2O2 production . These findings reveal a mechanism that could be an important contributor to oxidative stress characteristic of asthmatic airways , suggesting novel therapeutic targets for treating asthmatic airway disease .
