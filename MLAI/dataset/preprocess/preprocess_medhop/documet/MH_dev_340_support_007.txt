Impaired pulmonary defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in P15692 gene inactivated mouse lung . Repeated bacterial and viral infections are known to contribute to worsening lung function in several respiratory diseases , including asthma , cystic fibrosis , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . Previous studies have reported alveolar wall cell apoptosis and parenchymal damage in adult pulmonary P15692 gene ablated mice . We hypothesized that P15692 expressed by type II cells is also necessary to provide an effective host defense against bacteria in part by maintaining surfactant homeostasis . Therefore , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PAO1 ) levels were evaluated in mice following lung-targeted P15692 gene inactivation , and alterations in P15692 -dependent type II cell function were evaluated by measuring surfactant homeostasis in mouse lungs and isolated type II cells . In P15692 -deficient lungs increased PAO1 levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines , TNFÎ± and P05231 , were detected 24 h after bacterial instillation compared to control lungs . In vivo lung-targeted P15692 gene deletion ( 57 % decrease in total pulmonary P15692 ) did not alter alveolar surfactant or tissue disaturated phosphatidylcholine ( DSPC ) levels . However , sphingomyelin content , choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase ( Q9UPI3 ) mRNA , and P35247 expression were decreased . In isolated type II cells an 80 % reduction of P15692 protein resulted in decreases in total phospholipids ( PL ) , DSPC , DSPC synthesis , surfactant associated proteins ( SP ) -B and -D , and the lipid transporters , O95477 and Rab3D . TPA-induced DSPC secretion and apoptosis were elevated in P15692 -deficient type II cells . These results suggest a potential protective role for type II cell-expressed P15692 against bacterial initiated infection .
