Effect of DB06663 ( pasireotide ) on corticotropic cells : action in dogs with Cushing 's disease . DB06663 ( pasireotide ) is a multiligand somatostatin ( SRIF ) analog able to bind to somatostatin receptor ( SSTR ) subtypes 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 , and trigger antisecretory and antiproliferative signaling cascades . Canines have become in vivo models to test the pharmacological treatment of corticotropinomas because they frequently develop Cushing 's disease in a spontaneous manner , due to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) -producing pituitary adenomas . Different levels of expression of P30874 and P35346 have been shown in both mouse AtT20 cells and canine tumoral corticotropinoma cells . The objective of this study was to evaluate whether DB06663 controls both tumor cell growth and hormone synthesis , therefore controlling the disease . DB06663 was tested in dogs suffering from Cushing 's disease ( 10 animals were treated continuously during 6 months , and another 10 were treated with 3 cycles consisting of 2 months of treatment followed by a 2-month rest period ) . A significant decrease in DB01285 , urinary cortisol creatinine ratio , adenoma size ( magnetic nuclear resonance ) and improvement of clinical signs were obtained , without side effects . AtT20 cells treated with DB06663 suppressed pro-opiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) promoter activity through P30874 , via the G(i) Î±-subunit , and reduced P22736 /Nurr1 transcriptional activity . We conclude that DB06663 , in addition to its well-described antisecretory effects , inhibits , as shown in AtT20 cells , DB01285 synthesis at the P01189 transcriptional level , an effect mediated mainly through P30874 , and limits tumor growth . The controlled Cushing 's disease in the dogs that received the treatment indicates that DB06663 has a potential therapeutic use in humans suffering from Cushing 's disease .
