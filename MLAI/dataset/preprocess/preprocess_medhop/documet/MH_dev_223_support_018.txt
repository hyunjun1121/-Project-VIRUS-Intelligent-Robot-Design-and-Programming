The differential impact of DB05876 subtypes in human lung fibroblasts on cytokine-induced proliferation and myofibroblast conversion . Lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts are pathological key events during development of lung fibrosis . Cyclic nucleotide signaling is described as a negative modulator of these cellular processes , and cyclic nucleotide degrading type 4 phosphodiesterases ( DB05876 ) are important regulators of these pathways . In this study , we elucidated expression and the role of individual subtypes of DB05876 in primary normal human lung fibroblast ( NHLF ) in controlling cytokines-induced proliferation and conversion to myofibroblasts by short-interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) induced knockdown . We verified the expression of P27815 , B , and D , while Q08493 was only minor or even not expressed in NHLF . An efficient liposome-mediated transfection method for mRNA silencing and a knockdown of the expressed DB05876 subtypes was achieved in these cells . This knockdown was further validated by DB05876 protein expression analysis and DB05876 activity measurements . Functionally , the knockdown of P27815 and Q07343 inhibited proliferation induced by the cytokine combination of P09038 and IL-1β , whereas knockdown of Q08499 was ineffective . In contrast , TGF-β induced differentiation into myofibroblasts was affected by knockdown of Q07343 and Q08499 , but not by P27815 knockdown . In summary , our data allow to assign different DB05876 subtypes to distinct functions of human lung fibroblasts and highlight the predominant role of Q07343 in controlling pathophysiological processes of human lung fibroblasts . This provides a scientific rationale for focused therapeutic targeting of Q07343 to treat respiratory diseases with fibrotic lesions in the lung .
