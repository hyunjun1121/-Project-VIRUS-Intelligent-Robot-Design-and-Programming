Morphological and functional in vitro and in vivo characterization of the mouse corpus cavernosum . 1. In normal mice , the distribution of adrenergic , cholinergic , some peptidergic , and neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( P29475 ) -containing nerves were investigated . Functional in vitro correlates were obtained . An in vivo model was developed in which erectile haemodynamics in response to drugs or nerve-stimulation were studied . 2 . Immunoreactivities for vesicular acetylcholine transporter protein ( Q16572 ) , P29475 - , and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( P01282 ) , co-existed in nerve fibres and terminal varicosities . Immunoreactivities for neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) were found in the same nerve structures . 3 . Chemical sympathectomy abolished TH- and P01303 -IR nerve structures in cavernous smooth muscle bundles . The distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) - , P29475 - , Q16572 - and P01282 -IR nerve structures was unchanged . 4 . In endothelial cells of the central and helicine arteries , veins and venules , intense immunoreactivity for endothelial NOS ( P29474 ) was observed . No distinct P29474 -IR cells were found lining the cavernous sinusoids . 5 . In vitro , nerve-induced relaxations were verified , and endothelial NO/cyclic GMP-mediated relaxant responses were established . P01282 and P80511 had small relaxant effects . A functioning adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP pathway was confirmed . 6 . Neuronal excitatory responses were abolished by prazosin , or forskolin . P01282 and P80511 counteracted contractions , whereas P01303 and scopolamine enhanced excitatory responses . 7 . In vivo , erectile responses were significantly attenuated by L-NAME ( 50 mg kg(-1) ) and facilitated by sildenafil ( 200 microg kg(-1) ) . 8 . It is concluded that the mouse is a suitable model for studies of erectile mechanisms in vitro and in vivo .
