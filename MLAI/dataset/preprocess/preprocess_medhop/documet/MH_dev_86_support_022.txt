DB09036 for multicentric Castleman disease . Dysregulated secretion of P05231 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Castleman disease ( CD ) , a rare lymphoproliferative disorder . In contrast to unicentric CD for which surgery is considered the treatment of choice , there is no standard therapeutic approach for multicentric CD ( O95822 ) . DB09036 ( trade name : Sylvant , formerly known as CNTO 328 ) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody with high binding affinity for human P05231 . In a recent randomized placebo-controlled Phase II trial , subjects with HIV-negative , HHV8-negative O95822 who received siltuximab demonstrated a significantly higher rate of durable tumor and symptomatic response with a tolerable safety profile , leading to its approval for the treatment of HIV-negative HHV8-negative O95822 by the US FDA and the European Commission in April and May 2014 , respectively . This article will cover the current treatment options of O95822 , the drug profile of siltuximab and future directions in the management of O95822 .
