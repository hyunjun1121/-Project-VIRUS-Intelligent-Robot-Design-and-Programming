Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract : a trip from peptic ulcer to colon cancer . DB00945 was commercialized more than a 100 years ago . Today , this compound is still widely prescribed , and new mechanisms of action and indications are being tested . Inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 by aspirin or its related compounds , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , has been associated with both adverse and beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract . Inhibition of P23219 has been linked to GI adverse effects . Adverse effects of NSAIDs and aspirin in the upper GI tract include esophagitis , peptic ulcer , peptic ulcer complications , and death . Effective preventive therapies are available that have been associated with a progressive decline in the rate of hospitalization due to upper GI complications . NSAIDs and aspirin can also damage the small bowel and the colon . NSAID enteropathy is frequent and in most cases subclinical ( increased mucosal permeability , inflammation , erosion , ulcer ) . However , more serious clinical outcomes such as anemia , bleeding , perforation , obstruction , diverticulitis , and deaths have also been described . Prevention therapy of NSAID damage to the lower GI tract is not well defined . Inhibition of P35354 by NSAIDs , coxibs , or aspirin seems to provide beneficial effects to the GI tract . Observational studies show that these compounds reduce the risk of both upper and lower GI cancers . Randomized controlled trials have shown that aspirin and coxibs reduce the recurrence rate of colonic polyps , and long-term cohort studies have shown that aspirin reduces the risk of colon cancer time and dose dependently . New studies will have to define the appropriate population that may benefit with these therapies .
