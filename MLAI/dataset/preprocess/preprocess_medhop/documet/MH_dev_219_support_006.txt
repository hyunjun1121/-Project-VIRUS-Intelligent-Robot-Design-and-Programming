Iso-intense neuroenteric cyst in the lower cervical spine treated with ventral resection and anterior fusion utilising sternal notch exposure : case report , technical note and literature review . A 36-year-old female patient with a long-standing asymptomatic lower thoracic scoliosis presented with sensory symptoms involving all limbs . Q9BWK5 scan demonstrated a rounded ventral intradural mass causing major deformity of the cervical cord at P13671 and P10643 levels . Unlike most previously reported neurenteric cysts , the Q9BWK5 signal characteristics of this mass were such that it could not be determined if it is cystic or solid , being iso-intense on T1- and hyperintense P24752 -weighted images . Resection was performed through a median corporectomy of P13671 and P10643 , the lesion being found to be a neurenteric cyst with an attachment to the anterior median fissure of the cord . Strut graft and cervical locking plate fixation from P01031 to P13671 was facilitated by extending the cervical incision into the sternal notch , with detachment of left-sided strap muscle insertion . The patient made an excellent recovery with complete resolution of neurological symptoms and solid fusion . The postoperative course was complicated by an anterior cervical P04141 collection which resolved spontaneously within 2 months . The literature regarding this rare condition and its management is reviewed . Although the majority of intraspinal neurenteric cysts are situated ventral to the cord , most reports of excision have been from a dorsal approach . Drainage and subtotal excision of neurenteric cysts have been previously advocated ; however , the recurrence rate is such that complete excision is advocated . This is facilitated by a ventral approach . A simplified method of utilising the sternal notch exposure is reported . The literature regarding the anatomical peculiarities pertinent to the sternal notch approach , and the reported literature regarding spinal neurenteric cysts is reviewed .
