Regulatory regions of growth-related genes can activate an exogenous gene of the alpha-fetoprotein promoter to a comparable degree in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . We examined the transcriptional activation by the regulatory regions of the midkine ( MK ) , survivin ( Q09428 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , telomerase reverse transcriptase ( O14746 ) and alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) genes in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Luciferase assays showed that the Q09428 regulatory region exhibited the greatest activity and that the MK regulatory region activated the reporter gene better than the enhancer-linked AFP promoter even in high-AFP-producing cells . The P35354 and O14746 regulatory regions also activated the reporter gene better than the AFP enhancer/promoter in intermediate-AFP-producing cells . Combination of the regulatory regions arranged in tandem modulated their transcriptional activities , depending on the arrangement of the promoters and cells examined . These data suggested that the regulatory regions of the growth-related genes could be useful to activate a therapeutic gene in hepatocellular carcinoma cells irrespective of the amounts of AFP production but combinatory use of the promoter regions could not always contribute to enhanced activity .
