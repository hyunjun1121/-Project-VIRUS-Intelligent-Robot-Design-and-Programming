Initial testing of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor pazopanib by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program . DB06589 is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular growth factor receptor-1 , -2 , and -3 , platelet derived growth factor receptor-α , platelet derived growth factor receptor-β , and P10721 that has demonstrated activity against a variety of adult cancer xenografts . DB06589 was tested against a panel of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma xenografts at a dose of 108 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg twice daily , administered orally for 28 days . While no objective responses were observed , pazopanib induced statistically significant differences in event-free survival compared to controls in approximately one-half of the sarcoma xenograft models tested . Though well tolerated , pazopanib showed limited activity against the sarcoma models evaluated , with the best tumor responses being growth delay .
