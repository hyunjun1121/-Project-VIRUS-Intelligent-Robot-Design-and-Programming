QTL alleles on chromosome 7 from fatty Meishan pigs reduce fat deposition . For detecting QTL in the whole swine genome , 1068 pigs from three F2 populations constructed by crossing European Wild boar and Pietrain ( W x P ) , Meishan and Pietrain ( M x P ) , and Wild Boar and Meishan ( W x M ) were genotyped for genetic markers evenly spaced at approximately 20 cM intervals . AQTL analysis was performed using a least-squares method . Here the results of the QTL analysis on the porcine chromosome 7 are presented . QTL for carcass composition ( e.g. head weight , carcass length , backfat depth , abdominal fat and bacon meat ) were mapped in the chromosomal region P62937 / Q08752 - P01374 -S0102 in M x P and W x M , but not in W x P . The QTL explained 5.3 % -27.2 % of the F2 phenotypic variance in the two F2 populations . Most traits affected by the mapped QTL were related to carcass fatness . The mode of gene action of QTL was additive . Surprisingly , in contrast to the parental phenotype , the QTL alleles from fatty Meishan were associated with thinner backfat than Pietrain and Wild Boar alleles , suggesting that the genome of the fatty Meishan pig contains genes which can reduce fat content of carcass substantially .
