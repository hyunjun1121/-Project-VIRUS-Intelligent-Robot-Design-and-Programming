Targets of transcriptional regulation by two distinct type I receptors for transforming growth factor-beta in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) plays a crucial role in vascular development and homeostasis by regulating many transcriptional targets . P36897 ( P36897 ) is a P36897 expressed in various TGF-beta-responsive cells . In contrast , P37023 functions as a P36897 in endothelial cells , and is responsible for human hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( DB04865 ) type II . P36897 and P37023 mediate TGF-beta signals through distinct Smad proteins , i.e. , Q15796 / P84022 and Q15797 / Q99717 , respectively . To identify target genes of P37023 and P36897 in endothelial cells , we conducted oligonucleotide microarray analysis . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were infected with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a constitutively active form of P37023 or P36897 . P36897 inhibited the proliferation , network formation , and tube formation of HUVEC and induced their apoptosis , whereas P37023 did not exhibit significant effects on HUVEC in vitro . mRNAs were extracted from HUVEC and used for hybridization of oligonucleotide arrays representing approximately 7,000 human genes . Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analyses were also performed for some of these genes , confirming the validity of this microarray analysis . We found that P37023 specifically upregulated O43541 , O15105 , Id1 , Id2 , endoglin , P42224 , and interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 . P36897 , in contrast , upregulated P49763 , SM22alpha , connexin 37 , betaIG-H3 , and Q14766 . P37023 downregulated Q15797 , P61073 , P20827 , and plakoglobin , whereas P36897 downregulated claudin 5 and integrin beta(5) . These results revealed some new targets of TGF-beta in endothelial cells , and differences in transcriptional regulation patterns between P37023 and P36897 .
