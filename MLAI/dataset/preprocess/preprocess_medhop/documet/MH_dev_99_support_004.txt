Analysis of a 26-kb region linked to the Mhc in zebrafish : genomic organization of the proteasome component beta/transporter associated with antigen processing-2 gene cluster and identification of five new proteasome beta subunit genes . Sequencing of zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome genomic clone fragments and of cDNA clones has led to the identification of five new loci coding for beta subunits of proteasomes ( PSMB ) . Together with the four genes identified previously , nine PSMB genes have now been defined in the zebrafish . Six of the nine genes reside in the zebrafish MHC ( Mhc ) class I region , four of them reside in a single cluster closely associated with TAP2 on a 26-kb long genomic fragment , and two reside at some distance from the fragment . In addition to homologues of the human genes P28074 through P28065 , two new genes , A5LHX3 and PSMB12 , have been found for which there are no known corresponding genes in humans . The new genes reside in the PSMB cluster in the Mhc . Homology and promoter region analysis suggest that the Mhc-associated genes might be inducible by P01579 . The zebrafish class I region contains representatives of three phylogenetically distinguishable groups of PSMB genes , X , Y , and Z . It is proposed that these genes were present in the ancestral PSMB region before Mhc class I genes became associated with it .
