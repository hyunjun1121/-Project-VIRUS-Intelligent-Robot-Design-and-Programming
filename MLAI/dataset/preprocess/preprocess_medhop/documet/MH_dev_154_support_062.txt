Sp1 mediates constitutive and transforming growth factor beta-inducible expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor gene in human monocyte-like U937 cells . DB00013 type plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) is known to be involved in conversion of plasminogen into plasmin and its expression can be regulated by a variety of biological agents including transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) . In the present study , we cloned the promoter region of the human Q03405 ( huPAR ) gene ( -653 to +61 ) and investigated the transcription regulatory mechanism of the expression of the huPAR gene upon treatment with TGF-beta in human monocyte-like U937 cells . By deletion and point mutational analysis of the huPAR gene promoter , it was found that the sequence positioned at -70 is required for both constitutive and TGF-beta-inducible expression of the huPAR gene in U937 cells . Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , we could observe that Sp1 formed a DNA-protein complex at the -70 sequence . In addition , antisense oligonucleotide against human Sp1 blocked both constitutive and TGF-beta-inducible expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the huPAR gene promoter in U937 cells . These results led us to conclude that Sp1 transcription factor mediates constitutive and TGF-beta-inducible expression of the huPAR gene in U937 cells through binding to the sequence located at -70 .
