Treatment of ankylosing spondylitis with P01375 blockers : a meta-analysis . Biological agents directed against tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) represent therapeutic options for patients with ankylosing spondylitis with high disease activity despite use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the anti- P01375 agents infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , DB06674 , and certolizumab for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis , we performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials on adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis using articles culled from the EMBASE , MEDLINE , Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and LILACS databases ( September/2012 ) , manual literature search , and the gray literature . Study selections and data collection were performed by two independent reviewers , with disagreements solved by a third reviewer . The following outcomes were evaluated : ASAS 20 response , disease activity , physical function , vertebral mobility , adverse events , and withdraws . The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager(Â®) 5.1 software by applying the random effects model . Eighteen studies were included in this review . No study of certolizumab was included . Patients treated with anti- P01375 agents were more likely to display an ASAS 20 response after 12/14 weeks ( RR 2.21 ; 95 % CI 1.91 ; 2.56 ) and 24 weeks ( RR 2.68 ; 95 % CI 2.06 ; 3.48 ) compared with controls , which was also true for several other efficacy outcomes . Meta-analysis of safety outcomes and withdraws did not indicate statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups after 12 or 30 weeks . DB00051 , infliximab , etanercept , and DB06674 can effectively reduce the signs and symptoms of the axial component of ankylosing spondylitis . Safety outcomes deserve further study , especially with respect to long-term follow-ups .
