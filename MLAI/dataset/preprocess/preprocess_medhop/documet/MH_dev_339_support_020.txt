Open study of pranlukast add-on therapy in intractable partial epilepsy . Innovative treatments of epileptic seizures are needed to improve the outcome of epilepsy . We studied the effect of pranlukast on seizure outcome in patients with intractable partial epilepsy . An open study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 24-week pranlukast add-on therapy in 50 patients with intractable partial seizures . Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 were determined using Biotrak Activity Assay System . Cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) were measured by the BioPlex ( BioRad ) system and soluble P01375 receptor1 ( sTNFR1 ) in P04141 was measured by the ELISA . Surface markers of lymphocytes in P04141 were examined by cell-sorter . Seizure-free rate ( SFR ) was 13.6 % , responder rate ( RR ) was 47.7 % , and aggravation rate ( AR ) was 18.2 % at the 13-24 week period after starting pranlukast . In patients with increased serum P14780 before pranlukast therapy ( baseline ) , comparison of paired serum levels showed a significant decrease after pranlukast therapy . Baseline P04141 levels of IL-1β and P05231 were elevated in patients compared with disease controls . Of four patients with paired data , three ( including a responder to pranlukast ) showed decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1β , P05231 , and TNFα ) , and four showed decreased sTNFR1 , after pranlukast treatment , and only a responder had markedly decreased frequency of CD8+ T cells in P04141 . DB01411 reduces seizure frequencies probably by pleiotropic effects including normalization of P14780 in sera , reduced leakage of pro-inflammatory cytokines into CNS , and inhibition of extravasation of leucocytes from brain capillaries . Further investigations by double-blind control study and animal models are warranted .
