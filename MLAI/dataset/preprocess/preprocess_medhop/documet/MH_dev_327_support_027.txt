DB00197 , a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) ligand , selectively induces the early growth response-1 gene independently of Q07869 gamma . A novel mechanism for its anti-tumorigenic activity . DB00197 ( Q96PF1 ) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) ligand that has pro-apoptotic activity in human colon cancer . Although Q96PF1 binds to Q07869 gamma transcription factors as an agonist , emerging evidence suggests that Q96PF1 acts independently of Q07869 gamma in many functions , including apoptosis . Early growth response-1 ( Egr-1 ) transcription factor has been linked to apoptosis and shown to be activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) . We investigated whether Q96PF1 -induced apoptosis may be related to Egr-1 induction , because Q96PF1 has been known to induce P29323 activity . Our results show that Egr-1 is induced dramatically by Q96PF1 but not by other Q07869 gamma ligands . Q96PF1 affects Egr-1 induction at least by two mechanisms ; Q96PF1 increases Egr-1 promoter activity by 2-fold and prolongs Egr-1 mRNA stability by 3-fold . Inhibition of P29323 phosphorylation in HCT-116 cells abolishes the Egr-1 induction by Q96PF1 , suggesting its P29323 -dependent manner . Further , the Q96PF1 -induced Egr-1 expression results in increased promoter activity using a reporter system containing four copies of Egr-1 binding sites , and Q96PF1 induces Egr-1 binding activity to Egr-1 consensus sites as assessed by gel shift assay . In addition , Q96PF1 induces P29323 -dependent phosphorylation of Q07869 gamma , resulting in the down-regulation of Q07869 gamma activity . The fact that Q96PF1 -induced apoptosis is accompanied by the biosynthesis of Egr-1 suggests that Egr-1 plays a pivotal role in Q96PF1 -induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells . Our results suggest that Egr-1 induction is a unique property of Q96PF1 compared with other Q07869 gamma ligands and is independent of Q07869 gamma activation . Thus , the up-regulation of Egr-1 may provide an explanation for the anti-tumorigenic properties of Q96PF1 .
