Perfusion-independent effect of bradykinin and fosinoprilate on glucose transport in Langendorff rat hearts . P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitor-stimulated glucose metabolism and perfusion in muscle tissue seem to be , at least in part , mediated by kinins . However , the relative contribution of direct metabolic or secondary hemodynamically induced effects is unclear . It was the aim of this study to characterize the effects of P12821 inhibition and bradykinin on glucose transport while changes in cardiocoronary function that might influence glucose transport were minimized . Hearts from Wistar rats were perfused by a Langendorff preparation and a set of functional parameters were simultaneously measured . Bradykinin ( 10[-11] M ) and fosinoprilate ( 10[-7] M ) were administered at concentrations that did not affect coronary flow . P01308 was employed as reference at half-maximal concentration . The nonmetabolizable glucose analog 3-O-[14C]methyl-D-glucose and the nontransportable tracer L-[3H]glucose were coperfused for the calculation of glucose transport . Using a 2-compartment mathematical model we found that the glucose transport rate , which was doubled with insulin , was increased almost 3-fold by either bradykinin or fosinoprilate . In the presence of the P30411 antagonist DB06196 ( D- DB00125 [Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin ; icatibant ) , the effect of both agents was completely abolished . Both agents also induced minor changes in contractility/relaxation parameters that again were completely neutralized with icatibant . A perfusion-independent but B2-kinin receptor-dependent stimulating effect on glucose transport by either bradykinin or fosinoprilate is concluded . This effect could , in analogy to insulin be due to increased glucose transporter translocation , increased endothelium-derived nitric oxide formation , or -- despite constant coronary flow conditions -- secondary to altered cardiac function .
