Combination systemic therapies in psoriatic arthritis . Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) is a chronic , progressive , and debilitating disorder . When monotherapy fails , combination therapy is necessary for the long-term management of these patients . There is currently no review on this subject , and the purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the current literature on combination therapy in PsA . A PubMed MeSH search was performed for psoriatic arthritis and combination therapy , which yielded at total of 83 articles . After excluding reviews and commentaries , and pursuing relevant citations , a total of 21 articles on the subject were found : one study of NSAIDs and methotrexate , three studies of cyclosporine and methotrexate , three studies of non- P01375 biologic inhibitors ( alefacept , ustekinumab ) and methotrexate , and 14 studies of anti- P01375 -inhibitors ( etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab , DB06674 ) and methotrexate . The combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate reduces the dosages and also the side effects of each agent , allowing better disease control with less toxicity . DB00563 in combination with biologic agents , either non- P01375 inhibitors or anti- P01375 inhibitors , may have a role in decreasing side effects , but it does not appear to improve clinical symptoms beyond those attained by biologic monotherapy .
