Stimulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) and the expression of selected blood monocyte cytokine genes in diabetic macroangiopathy . Monocytes and macrophages play a key role in the progression of atheromatous changes . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) can limit macroangiopathy through the control of cytokine transcription . The objectives of this study were to examine the influence of Q07869 gamma and its agonist ( rosiglitazone ) on the TNFalpha , P05231 , P10145 and P22301 gene expression in monocytes of patients with diabetic macroangiopathy and to analyse obtained results in context of selected atherogenic factors ant direct indicators of endothelial lesion . TNFalpha , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 and Q07869 gamma gene expression was assessed in peripheral blood monocytes in 45 patients with type 2 diabetes before and following 22 weeks of rosiglitazone therapy ( real-time PCR [ Applied Biosystems ] ) . As indicators of endothelial lesion , concentration of thrombomodulin ( immunoassay [ Diagnostica Stago ] ) and amount of circulating blood endothelial cells ( immunofluorescence method with MoAb Q8N0X4 -HEC19 ) were determined . Following rosiglitazone therapy , a statistically significant downward tendency of TNFalpha ( p=0.026 ) and P10145 ( p=0.008 ) gene expression was noted . Before and following rosiglitazone treatment , Q07869 gamma , P05231 and P22301 gene expression was undetectable in studied monocytes in vivo . In conclusion , TNFalpha and P10145 play an important role in monocyte atherogenic activity . Rosiglitazone reduces monocyte proinflammatory readiness by influencing the expression of selected atherogenic cytokines ( Q07869 gamma-independent pathway ) .
