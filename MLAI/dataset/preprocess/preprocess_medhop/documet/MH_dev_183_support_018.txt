P01308 -like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor , Q99217 -479 , in cetuximab-refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . BACKGROUND : Recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains a difficult cancer to treat . Here , we describe a patient with HNSCC who had complete response to methotrexate ( MTX ) after progressing on multiple cytotoxic agents , cetuximab , and Q99217 -479 ( monoclonal antibody against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor [ IGF-1R ] ) . METHODS : The clinical information was collected by a retrospective medical record review under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol . From 4 tumors and 2 normal mucosal epithelia , global gene expression , and IGF-1R and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) protein levels were determined . RESULTS : Effective target inhibition in the tumor was confirmed by the decreased protein levels of total and phospho-IGF-1R after treatment with Q99217 -479 . Decreased level of P00374 and conversion of a gene expression profile associated with cetuximab-resistance to cetuximab-sensitivity were also observed . CONCLUSION : This suggests that the combination of Q99217 -479 and MTX or cetuximab may be a promising therapeutic approach in refractory HNSCC .
