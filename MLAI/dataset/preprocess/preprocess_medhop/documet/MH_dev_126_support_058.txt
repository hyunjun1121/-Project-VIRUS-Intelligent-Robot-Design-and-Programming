Targeted therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer . Although treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has been improved with the availability of such new agents as the taxanes , topoisomerase inhibitors , vinorelbine ( Navelbine ) , and gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) , platinum-based combination therapy has appeared to reach a threshold of therapeutic effectiveness . A paradigm shift in approach to non-small-cell lung cancer and other tumors may be heralded by the development of agents targeting specific biologic pathways in tumor development . Such new agents include antibody epithelial growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitors ( eg , the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab [ Herceptin ] and cetuximab [ IMC-C225 , Erbitux ] ) and P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( eg , ZD1839 [ DB00317 ] and DB00530 ) , angiogenesis inhibitors ( eg , matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) inhibitors ( eg , monoclonal antibody to P15692 ligand and small-molecule tyrosine kinase ) , and signal transduction inhibitors ( eg , ISIS-3521 , an antisense oligonucleotide to protein kinase C-alpha ) . A number of these agents have entered advanced-phase clinical investigation . It is likely that targeted therapy will have applications in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy at all stages of treatment , including maintenance therapy . It is even possible that these new biologic therapies will be used together as rational combinations ( based on pathologic diagnosis ) for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer .
