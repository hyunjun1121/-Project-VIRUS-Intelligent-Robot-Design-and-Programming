[ Treatment of renal vein thromboses in the newborn ] . Surgical thrombectomy is not a rational approach to neonatal renal vein thrombosis since the occlusion mainly involves intrarenal branches rather than the main renal vein , which is even patent in some instances . Conservative management combines supportive therapy for renal failure and systemic hypertension , if needed , and either heparin or thrombolytic agents . DB00086 has proven difficult to handle in neonates and should not be used . DB00013 has been used in 18 patients but results are difficult to interpret because these cases occurred over an 18-year period . P00747 tissue activator , the latest thrombolytic agent developed , has been used in few pediatric patients . An international task force is currently studying whether or not a randomized study is warranted to provide data for standardizing thrombolytic therapy in pediatric renal vein thrombosis .
