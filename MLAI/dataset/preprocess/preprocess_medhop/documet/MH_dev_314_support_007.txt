Steroid receptor coactivator 2 is required for female fertility and mammary morphogenesis : insights from the mouse , relevance to the human . Although the importance of the progesterone receptor ( PR ) to female reproductive and mammary gland biology is firmly established , the coregulators selectively co-opted by PR in these systems have not been clearly delineated . A selective gene-knockout approach applied to the mouse , which abrogates gene function only in cell types that express PR , recently disclosed steroid receptor coactivator 2 ( P12931 -2 , also known as Q06418 -2 or Q9Y3R0 ) to be an indispensable coregulator for uterine and mammary gland responses that require progesterone . Uterine cells positive for PR ( but devoid of P12931 -2 ) were found to be incapable of facilitating embryo implantation , a necessary first step toward the establishment of the materno-fetal interface . Importantly , such an implantation defect is not exhibited by knockouts for Q15788 or Q9Y6Q9 , underscoring the unique coregulator importance of P12931 -2 in peri-implantation biology . Moreover , despite normal levels of PR , Q15788 and Q9Y6Q9 , progesterone-dependent branching morphogenesis and alveologenesis fails to occur in the murine mammary gland in the absence of P12931 -2 , thereby establishing a critical coregulator role for P12931 -2 in signaling cascades that mediate progesterone-induced mammary epithelial proliferation . Finally , the recent detection of P12931 -2 in the human endometrium and breast suggests that this coregulator may represent a new clinical target for the future management of female reproductive health and/or breast cancer .
