P01579 -induced P56817 expression is mediated by activation of O60674 and P27361 /2 signaling pathways and direct binding of P42224 to P56817 promoter in astrocytes . P56817 ( P56817 ) is an essential enzyme for the production of beta amyloid . Since we found that injection of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) into young mouse brains increased P56817 expression in astrocytes , we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying this process by cloning a putative P56817 promoter . P56817 promoter activity was differentially regulated by P01579 in a region specific manner and down-regulated by an inhibitor of O60674 ( O60674 ) . A dominant negative mutant of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( P42224 ) expression suppressed P56817 promoter activity , and this was rescued by transfecting wild type P42224 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and promoter activity assays indicated that P42224 binds directly to the putative P42224 binding sequence of P56817 promoter . Because P01579 treatment induced P42224 phosphorylation , we examined whether the expression of a suppressor of cytokine signaling ( Q9NSE2 ) , negative regulator of O60674 , suppresses P56817 promoter activity . The results show that O15524 or O14543 expression suppressed P56817 promoter by blocking phosphorylation of Tyr701 residue in P42224 . Also , because P01579 treatment specifically potentiated extracellular signal regulated Q96HU1 kinase ( P29323 ) 1/2 activation , pretreatment of mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , PD98059 , significantly attenuated P01579 -induced P56817 promoter activity and protein expression through blocking phosphorylation of Ser727 residue in P42224 , suggesting that P27361 /2 is associated with P01579 -induced P42224 signaling cascade . Taken together , our results suggest that P01579 activates O60674 and P27361 /2 and then phosphorylated P42224 binds to the putative P42224 binding sequences in P56817 promoter region to modulate P56817 protein expression in astrocytes .
