Role of phospholipase D2 in the agonist-induced and constitutive endocytosis of G-protein coupled receptors . We have recently shown that the mu-opioid receptor [ P35372 , also termed mu-opioid peptide ( MOP ) receptor ] is associated with the phospholipase D2 ( O14939 ) , a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane . We further demonstrated that , in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells co-expressing P35372 and O14939 , treatment with ( D-Ala2 , Me Phe4 , Glyol5 ) enkephalin ( DAMGO ) led to an increase in O14939 activity and an induction of receptor endocytosis , whereas morphine , which does not induce opioid receptor endocytosis , failed to activate O14939 . In contrast , a C-terminal splice variant of the mu-opioid receptor ( MOR1D , also termed MOP(1D) ) exhibited robust endocytosis in response to both DAMGO and morphine treatment . We report here that MOR1D also mediates an agonist-independent ( constitutive ) O14939 -activation facilitating agonist-induced and constitutive receptor endocytosis . Inhibition of O14939 activity by over-expression of a dominant negative O14939 ( nPLD2 ) blocked the constitutive O14939 activation and impaired the endocytosis of MOR1D receptors . Moreover , we provide evidence that the endocytotic trafficking of the delta-opioid receptor [ Q8IXH6 , also termed delta-opioid peptide ( DOP ) receptor ] and cannabinoid receptor isoform 1 ( P21554 ) is also mediated by a O14939 -dependent pathway . These data indicate the generally important role for O14939 in the regulation of agonist-dependent and agonist-independent G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) endocytosis .
