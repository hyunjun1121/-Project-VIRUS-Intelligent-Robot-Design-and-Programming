P11926 inhibition by alpha-difluoromethylornithine activates opposing signaling pathways via phosphorylation of both Akt/protein kinase B and P46527 in neuroblastoma . P11926 ( ODC ) is a key enzyme in mammalian polyamine biosynthesis that is up-regulated in various types of cancer . We previously showed that treating human neuroblastoma ( NB ) cells with the ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DB06243 ) depleted polyamine pools and induced P55008 cell cycle arrest without causing apoptosis . However , the precise mechanism by which DB06243 provokes these changes in NB cells remained unknown . Therefore , we further examined the effects of DB06243 , alone and in combination with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 or Akt/protein kinase B ( P31749 ) inhibitor IV , on the regulation of cell survival and cell cycle-associated pathways in LAN-1 NB cells . In the present study , we found that the inhibition of ODC by DB06243 promotes cell survival by inducing the phosphorylation of Akt/ P31749 at residue Ser473 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta at Ser9 . Intriguingly , DB06243 also induced the phosphorylation of P46527 at residues Ser10 ( nuclear export ) and Thr198 ( protein stabilization ) but not Thr187 ( proteasomal degradation ) . The combined results from this study provide evidence for a direct cross-talk between ODC-dependent metabolic processes and well-established cell signaling pathways that are activated during NB tumorigenesis . The data suggest that inhibition of ODC by DB06243 induces two opposing pathways in NB : one promoting cell survival by activating Akt/ P31749 via the PI3K/Akt pathway and one inducing P46527 /retinoblastoma-coupled P55008 cell cycle arrest via a mechanism that regulates the phosphorylation and stabilization of P46527 . This study presents new information that may explain the moderate efficacy of DB06243 monotherapy in clinical trials and reveals potential new targets for DB06243 -based combination therapies for NB treatment .
