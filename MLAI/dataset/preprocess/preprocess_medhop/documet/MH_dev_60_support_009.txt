Q9Y271 promoter polymorphism and requirement for leukotriene receptor antagonist in aspirin-intolerant asthma patients . OBJECTIVES : Leukotriene receptor antagonists ( LTRA ) , such as montelukast , have been used as a first-line treatment for patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma ( AIA ) . This study evaluated associations between the clinical requirement for LTRA and genetic polymorphisms of the P09917 , Q16873 , P35354 , Q9Y271 and P21731 genes in the arachidonic acid cascade in the long-term management of 89 AIA patients from a Korean population . METHODS : Asthma control status was monitored for 1 year with maintenance medications of inhaled corticosteroid and oral LTRA , and AIA patients were classified into three groups according to the mean montelukast dose required per month to maintain asthma control for 1 year : group I ( > or = 200 mg montelukast/month ; n = 37 ) , group II ( 5-150 mg/month ; n = 25 ) and group III ( < 5 mg/month ; n = 27 ) . Genetic polymorphisms in the arachidonic acid cascade were determined using a single-base extension method . RESULTS : We found that there was a significant difference in the genotype frequency of the Q9Y271 promoter polymorphism -634C > T among the three groups ( p = 0.007 for group I vs group II , p = 0.017 for group I vs group III ) , while there were no significant associations between LTRA requirements and polymorphisms of the other genes . The patients with the variant genotype ( CT or TT ) of the -634C = T Q9Y271 promoter polymorphism showed a higher expression level than those with the common genotype ( CC ) . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that the Q9Y271 promoter polymorphism is a useful genetic marker for predicting LTRA requirements in the long-term management of AIA patients .
