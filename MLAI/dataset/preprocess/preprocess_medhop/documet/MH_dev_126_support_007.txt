Targeted therapy using novel agents in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer . Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) have a poor prognosis and high mortality . The therapeutic improvement caused by the new generation of cytotoxic agents seems to have reached a plateau . The main categories of targeted therapeutics applicable for NSCLC include receptor-targeted therapy , signal transduction or cell-cycle inhibition , angiogenesis inhibitors , gene therapy , and vaccines . Several major classes of agents directed at specific cellular mechanisms exist for the treatment of NSCLC . The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) group contains trastuzumab and IMC-C225 , monoclonal antibodies against EGFRs that are overexpressed in many cancers . DB00530 and ZD1839 are inhibitors of P00533 tyrosine kinase , a key enzyme of the signaling pathway . Farnesyl transferase inhibitors , such as SCH66336 , and protein kinase C inhibitors , such as ISIS 3521 , have also shown antitumor activity . Antiangiogenesis agents that have shown promise include TNP-470 , recombinant endostatin , and angiostatin . Antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) also seem to control tumor progression and may prolong survival . LY317615 , an inhibitor of protein kinase Cb , augmented the tumor growth delay produced by cytotoxic drugs . All of these agents are in different phases of clinical testing and have shown encouraging activity as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy drugs . These new agents are more target specific , less toxic , easier to administer , and may lead to enhanced safety and survival for patients with advanced NSCLC .
