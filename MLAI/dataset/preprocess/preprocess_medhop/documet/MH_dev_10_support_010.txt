Inhibition of farnesylpyrophosphate synthase prevents angiotensin II-induced hypertrophic responses in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes : involvement of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway . The RhoA/Rho-kinase ( ROCK ) pathway is involved in angiotensin ( Ang ) II-induced cardiac hypertrophy . However , it is still unclear whether inhibition of farnesylpyrophosphate ( FPP ) synthase can attenuate Ang II-induced hypertrophic responses , and whether it involves the RhoA/ROCK pathway . The anti-hypertrophic effects of inhibition of P14324 with alendronate in Ang II-cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes were partially reversed by geranylgeranyol ( GGOH ) and were mimicked by GGTI-286 , a geranylgeranyl transferase-I inhibitor , P01024 exoenzyme , an inhibitor of Rho , or Y-27632 , an inhibitor of ROCK . Pull-down assay showed alendronate reduced-active RhoA by Ang II was also partially antagonized by GGOH . This study revealed that the inhibition of P14324 by alendronate reduces RhoA activation by diminishing geranylgeranylation which prevents Ang II-induced hypertrophic responses in neonatal cardiomyocytes .
