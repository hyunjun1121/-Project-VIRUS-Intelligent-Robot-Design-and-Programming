Role of the P08908 receptor in development of the neonatal rat brain : preliminary behavioral studies . Serotonin exerts an influence on the prenatal development of rat brain . However , later developmental times may be more applicable to the understanding of the role of serotonin in human developmental disorders . Therefore , the current study was undertaken to gain preliminary information on the postnatal effects of serotonin on rat brain development . As the P08908 receptor has been shown to be involved in much of the developmental functions of serotonin , an agonist for this receptor , 8-hydroxy-DPAT ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , was used . Neonatal rat pups at three ages ( postnatal days , PNDs ) 3-10 , 10-17 or 17-24 ) were injected daily with 1 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT and evaluated for behavioral consequences . The youngest group showed accelerated incisor eruption and eye-opening , a possible consequence of P08908 receptor interactions with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . Behaviorally , the animals were more anxious . Animals treated from P01160 10-17 , showed no change in craniofacial development but showed greater behavioral maturity in measures of spontaneous alternation and activity in the open field . The oldest animals ( P01160 17-24 ) showed no behavioral alterations , suggesting that this time length is beyond the critical period for serotonin 's influence in brain development .
