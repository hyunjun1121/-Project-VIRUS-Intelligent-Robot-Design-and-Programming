Novel pyrrolyllactone and pyrrolyllactam indolinones as potent cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors . P12004 -dependent kinases ( CDKs ) are essential in the control of cell cycle progression . Inhibition of CDKs represents a new approach for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of a variety of proliferative diseases , especially cancer . Based on the crystal structure of P24941 in complex with an imidazole indolinone compound 1 ( DB03428 ) , lead optimization through modeling , synthesis , and SAR studies has led to the discovery of a novel series of pyrrolyllactone and pyrrolyllactam indolinones as potent P24941 inhibitors .
