New treatments for inflammatory rheumatic disease . As our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is growing , new therapies are being developed to target disease-specific pathways . Since the introduction of etanercept in 1998 , several biotechnological agents have been developed , most of them indicated in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , but also psoriatic arthritis . Most currently available molecules target P01375 -alfa with different strategies ( i.e. , etanercept , infliximab , adalimumab , DB06674 , and certolizumab pegol ) , P05231 ( tocilizumab ) , P16410 ( abatacept ) , and B cells ( rituximab , belimumab ) as they are key mediators in the cascade of inflammation . Further , small molecules have been recently developed to target intracellular signaling , such as Janus Kinases for tofacitinib , the first FDA-approved small molecule for rheumatoid arthritis . Most novel treatments are being developed for arthritis with specific differences between rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis , as well as for systemic lupus erythematosus , following the approval of belimumab . Finally , biologic therapies are effective also in gout , mainly targeting interleukin-1 to block the inflammasome . This review article describes the new and upcoming treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and gout to dissect what we should be aware of when discussing these new and promising molecules .
