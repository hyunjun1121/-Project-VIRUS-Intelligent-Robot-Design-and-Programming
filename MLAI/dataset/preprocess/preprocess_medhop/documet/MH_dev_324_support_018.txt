Evaluation of commercial antibodies against human sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 . DB03203 -1-phosphate receptor 1 ( P21453 ) , also called endothelial differentiation gene 1 , plays an important role in migration , proliferation , and survival of several types of cells including endothelial cells and lymphocytes and is involved in multiple sclerosis . Two commercial rabbit anti- P21453 antibodies ( polyclonal and monoclonal ) were tested on CHO cells expressing P21453 receptors fused to the green fluorescent protein at the C-terminal end and on Pichia pastoris and P29320 cells expressing cmyc-tagged P21453 . Polyclonal antibodies did not give any signal by Western blot , immunofluorescence , and flow cytofluorometry . Monoclonal antibodies were able to reveal an unspecific band by Western blot performed on various cell types . Consequently , in our hands and using our protocols , we show that these antibodies did not specifically detect P21453 receptors .
