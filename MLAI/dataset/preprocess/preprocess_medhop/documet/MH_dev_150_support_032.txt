Maternal separation produces alterations of forebrain brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in differently aged rats . Early life adversity , such as postnatal maternal separation ( MS ) , play a central role in the development of psychopathologies during individual ontogeny . In this study , we investigated the effects of repeated MS ( 4 h per day from postnatal day ( P01160 ) 1-21 ) on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) expression in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and the hippocampus of male and female juvenile ( P01160 21 ) , adolescent ( P01160 35 ) and young adult ( P01160 56 ) Wistar rats . The results indicated that MS increased P23560 in the P00915 and the dentate gyrus ( DG ) of adolescent rats as well as in the DG of young adult rats . However , the expression of P23560 in the mPFC in the young adult rats was decreased by MS . Additionally , in the hippocampus , there was decreased P23560 expression with age in both the MS and non separated rats . However , in the mPFC , the P23560 expression was increased with age in the non separated rats ; nevertheless , the P23560 expression was significantly decreased in the MS young adult rats . In the NAc , the P23560 expression was increased with age in the male non-maternal separation ( Q5H8A3 ) rats , and the young adult female MS rats had less P23560 expression than the adolescent female MS rats . The present study shows unique age-differently changes on a molecular level induced by MS and advances the use of MS as a valid animal model to detect the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of mental disorders .
