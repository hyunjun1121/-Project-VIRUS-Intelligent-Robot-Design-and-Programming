Anti- P01375 -A therapy about infliximab and adalimamab for the effectiveness in ulcerative colitis compared with conventional therapy : a meta-analysis . BACKGROUND/AIMS : P01375 -α has an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . It seems that anti- P01375 -α therapy is beneficial in the treatment of UC . The aim was to assess the effectiveness of DB00065 and Adalimamab with UC compared with conventional therapy . METHODOLOGY : The Pubmed and Embase databases were searched for studies investigating the efficacy of infliximab and adalimumab on UC . RESULTS : DB00065 had a statistically significant effects in induction of clinical response ( RR = 1.67 ; 95 % CI 1.12 to 2.50 ) of UC compared with conventional therapy , but those had not a statistically significant effects in clinical remission ( RR = 1.63 ; 95 % CI 0.84 to 3.18 ) and reduction of colectomy rate ( RR = 0.54 ; 95 % CI 0.26 to 1.12 ) of UC . And adalimumab had a statistically significant effects in induction of clinical remission ( RR = 1.82 ; 95 % CI 1.24 to 2.67 ) and clinical response ( RR = 1.36 ; 95 % CI 1.13 to 1.64 ) of UC compared with conventional therapy . CONCLUSION : Our meta-analyses suggested that DB00065 had a statistically significant effects in induction of clinical response of UC compared with conventional therapy and adalimumab had a statistically significant effects in induction of clinical remission and clinical response of UC compared with conventional therapy .
