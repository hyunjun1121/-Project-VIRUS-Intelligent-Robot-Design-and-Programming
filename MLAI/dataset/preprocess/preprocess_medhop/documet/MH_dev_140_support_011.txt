An online coupled cell membrane chromatography with LC/MS method for screening compounds from Aconitum carmichaeli Debx. acting on P35968 . An online analytical method coupling high expression vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) cell membrane chromatography ( VEGFR-CMC ) with high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC/MS ) for screening and identification of active component from traditional Chinese herb Aconitum carmichaeli Debx. acting on P35968 was established . Through a 10-port column switcher , factions separated by VEGFR-CMC column ( first dimension ) were transferred and were adsorbed on an enrichment column . Then , these fractions were sent into LC/MS system ( second dimension ) immediately and directly for separation and preliminary identification , respectively . DB01268 malate ( SN ) was used as positive control , while nifedipine ( NF ) , dexamethasone acetate ( DX ) , methoxyamine hydrochloride ( MT ) and atenolol ( AT ) as negative controls . The specification of this VEGFR-CMC-online-LC/MS method was validated by competitive displacement test . As a result , mesaconitine ( O60682 ) , aconitine ( AC ) , and hypaconitine ( HPC ) were identified as the active constituents acting on P35968 . The in vitro inhibition activity of starting extract of Aconitum carmichaeli Debx. , O60682 , AC , and HPC on HEK293/VEGFR cell viability by MTT test , separately . The in vitro inhibition activity of O60682 , AC , and HPC on vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) secretion of HEK293/VEGFR cell was tested by P15692 -ELISA assay . The screening results given by the system offered additional exemplification supporting this online coupling method and gave new evidence to the development of anti-tumor drug from natural products .
