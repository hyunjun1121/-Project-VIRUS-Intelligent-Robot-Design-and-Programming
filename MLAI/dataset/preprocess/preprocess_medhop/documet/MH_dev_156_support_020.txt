DB01088 has potent anti-inflammatory properties on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells . BACKGROUND : The stable prostaglandin I2 analogue ( iloprost ) iloprost has been shown to inhibit allergic airway inflammation in mice by modulating the function of myeloid dendritic cells ( DCs ) . OBJECTIVE : The aim of the current study was to investigate the biological activity of iloprost on human monocyte-derived DCs . METHODS : I prostanoid ( IP ) receptor expression was analysed by RT-PCR . Cytokine secretion by DCs and P01730 + T cells was measured by ELISA . The expression of the transcription factor FoxP3 after co-culture of DCs with P01730 + CD45RA+ T cells was analysed by flow cytometry . RESULTS : Human monocyte-derived DCs were found to express mRNA specific for the P43119 IP , and stimulation with iloprost resulted in increased cyclic AMP levels in both immature DCs ( iDCs ) and mature DCs ( mDCs ) . Moreover , iloprost dose dependently inhibited the secretion of P01375 , P05231 , P10145 and IL-12p70 in mDCs , while it enhanced P22301 production . Changes in cytokine secretion were paralleled by an altered T-cell priming capacity of DCs : in co-culture experiments of iloprost-treated mDC and na√Øve CD45RA+ T cells , an induction of regulatory T cells could be observed , as demonstrated by increased intracellular FoxP3 expression and P22301 production . Additionally , iloprost inhibited the MIP-3beta-induced migration of mDCs . CONCLUSION : In summary , our results provide evidence that iloprost profoundly affects the function of human myeloid DCs . Therefore , iloprost might also be a new therapeutical option for the treatment of asthma in humans .
