Positive association between O94788 and schizophrenia in the Chinese population . DB00162 ( retinol ) , in the biologically active form of retinoic acid ( RA ) , has been proposed as involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . We hypothesized that genetic basis of genes encoding RA metabolism enzymes , which control the cellular RA level , might be associated with this disease . This cascade genetic association model , using markers in genes of synthesis and degradation enzymes within the retinoid cascade , would better fit the biological character of the retinoid hypothesis than the single gene strategy . In the present study we chose to investigate 7 genes involved in the synthesis , degradation and transportation of RA , P00352 , O94788 , P47895 , O43174 , Q9NR63 , Q6V0L0 and P02766 ( P02766 ) , for their roles in the development of schizophrenia . We genotyped 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the regulatory and coding regions of these 7 genes using LDR technology in the 617 Chinese Han subjects . Case-control analyses were performed to detect association of these 7 genes with schizophrenia . Association analyses using both allelic and genotypic single-locus tests revealed no significant association between the risk for each of investigated gene and schizophrenia . However , analyses of multiple-locus haplotypes indicated that the overall frequency of rs4646642-rs4646580 of O94788 gene showed significant difference between patients and control subjects ( p=0.0055 ) . We also employed multifactor dimensionality reduction method to detect multilocus effects . In summary , in this work we show multiple candidate genes involved in retinoid cascade in schizophrenics . In addition , our results suggest a positive association between O94788 and schizophrenics in the Chinese population and support the retinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia .
