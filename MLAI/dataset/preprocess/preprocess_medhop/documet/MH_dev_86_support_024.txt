A phase 2 , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of siltuximab ( anti- P05231 mAb ) and bortezomib versus bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma . We compared the safety and efficacy of siltuximab ( S ) , an anti-interleukin-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody , plus bortezomib ( B ) with placebo ( plc ) + B in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in a randomized phase 2 study . DB09036 was given by 6 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks . On progression , B was discontinued and high-dose dexamethasone could be added to S/plc . Response and progression-free survival ( PFS ) were analyzed pre-dexamethasone by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria . For the 281 randomized patients , median PFS for S + B and plc + B was 8.0 and 7.6 months ( HR 0.869 , P = 0.345 ) , overall response rate was 55 versus 47 % ( P = 0.213 ) , complete response rate was 11 versus 7 % , and median overall survival ( OS ) was 30.8 versus 36.8 months ( HR 1.353 , P = 0.103 ) . Sustained suppression of P02741 , a marker reflective of inhibition of interleukin-6 activity , was seen with S + B . DB09036 did not affect B pharmacokinetics . DB09036 /placebo discontinuation ( 75 versus 66 % ) , grade â‰¥3 neutropenia ( 49 versus 29 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 48 versus 34 % ) , and all-grade infections ( 62 versus 49 % ) occurred more frequently with S + B . The addition of siltuximab to bortezomib did not appear to improve PFS or OS despite a numerical increase in response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma .
