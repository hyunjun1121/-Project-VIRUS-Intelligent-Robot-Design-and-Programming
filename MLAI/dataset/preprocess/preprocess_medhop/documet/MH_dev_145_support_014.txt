Microtubule-depolymerizing agents used in antibody-drug conjugates induce antitumor immunity by stimulation of dendritic cells . Antibody-drug conjugates ( ADC ) are emerging as powerful treatment strategies with outstanding target-specificity and high therapeutic activity in patients with cancer . DB08870 represents a first-in-class ADC directed against P28908 (+) malignancies . We hypothesized that its sustained clinical responses could be related to the stimulation of an anticancer immune response . In this study , we demonstrate that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors , from which the cytotoxic component of brentuximab vedotin is derived , comprises potent inducers of phenotypic and functional dendritic cell ( DC ) maturation . In addition to the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells , dolastatins efficiently promoted antigen uptake and migration of tumor-resident DCs to the tumor-draining lymph nodes . Exposure of murine and human DCs to dolastatins significantly increased their capacity to prime T cells . Underlining the requirement of an intact host immune system for the full therapeutic benefit of dolastatins , the antitumor effect was far less pronounced in immunocompromised mice . We observed substantial therapeutic synergies when combining dolastatins with tumor antigen-specific vaccination or blockade of the P18621 - Q9NZQ7 and P16410 coinhibitory pathways . Ultimately , treatment with ADCs using dolastatins induces DC homing and activates cellular antitumor immune responses in patients . Our data reveal a novel mechanism of action for dolastatins and provide a strong rationale for clinical treatment regimens combining dolastatin-based therapies , such as brentuximab vedotin , with immune-based therapies .
