The effects of nepafenac and amfenac on retinal angiogenesis . PURPOSE : DB06802 is a potent NSAID that rapidly penetrates the eye following topical ocular administration . In the eye , nepafenac is converted to amfenac , which has unique time-dependent inhibitory properties for P23219 and P35354 . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the capacity of amfenac to inhibit discrete aspects of the angiogenic cascade in vitro , and to test the efficacy of amfenac and nepafenac in vivo , using the rat OIR model . METHODS : MÃ¼ller cells were treated with amfenac , celecoxib ( P35354 ) , or SC-560 ( P23219 ) , and hypoxia-induced P15692 and PGE(2) assessed . Endothelial cells were treated with amfenac , celecoxib , or SC-560 , and P15692 -induced proliferation and tube formation assessed . Rat pups were subjected to OIR , received intravitreal injections of amfenac , celecoxib , or SC-560 , and neovascularization ( NV ) , prostanoid production , and P15692 assessed . Other OIR-exposed pups were treated with topical nepafenac , ketorolac , or diclofenac , and inhibition of NV assessed . RESULTS : Amfenac treatment failed to inhibit hypoxia-induced P15692 production . Amfenac treatment significantly inhibited P15692 -induced tube formation and proliferation by EC . Amfenac treatment significantly reduced retinal prostanoid production and NV in OIR . DB06802 treatment significantly reduced retinal NV in OIR ; ketorolac and diclofenac had no effect . CONCLUSIONS : DB06802 and amfenac inhibit OIR more effectively than the commercially available topical and injectable NSAIDs used in this study . Our data suggests there are P36551 -dependent and P36551 -independent mechanisms by which amfenac inhibits OIR . Because it is bioavailable to the posterior segment following topical delivery , nepafenac appears to be a promising advancement in the development of therapies for neovascular eye diseases .
