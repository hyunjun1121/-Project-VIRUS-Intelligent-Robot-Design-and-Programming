Dynamics of P08514 /IIIa-mediated platelet-platelet interactions in platelet adhesion/thrombus formation on collagen in vitro as revealed by videomicroscopy . The conventional description of platelet interactions with collagen-coated surfaces in vitro , based on serial static measurements , is that platelets first adhere and spread to form a monolayer and then recruit additional layers of platelets . To obtain dynamic information , we studied gravity-driven platelet deposition in vitro on purified type 1 collagen by video phase-contrast microscopy at 22 degrees C . With untreated human and wild-type mouse platelets , soon after the initial adhesion of a small number of " vanguard " platelets , " follower " platelets attached to the spread-out vanguard platelets . Follower platelets then adhered to and spread onto nearby collagen or over the vanguard platelets . Thus , thrombi formed as a concerted process rather than as sequential processes . Treatment of human platelets with monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) DB00054 ( anti- P08514 /IIIa ( alphaIIbbeta3 ) + alphaVbeta3 ) or tirofiban ( anti- P08514 /IIIa ) did not prevent platelet adhesion but nearly eliminated the deposition of follower platelets onto vanguard platelets and platelet thrombi . Similar results were obtained with Glanzmann thrombasthenia platelets . Wild-type mouse platelets in the presence of mAb 1B5 ( anti- P08514 /IIIa ) and platelets from beta3-null mice behaved like human platelets in the presence of 7E3 or tirofiban . Deposition patterns of untreated human and wild-type mouse platelets were consistent with random distributions under a Poisson model , but those obtained with 7E3- and tirofiban-treated human platelets , 1B5-treated mouse platelets , or beta3-null platelets demonstrated a more uniform deposition than predicted . Thus , in this model system , absence or blockade of P08514 /IIIa receptors interferes with thrombus formation and alters the pattern of platelet deposition .
