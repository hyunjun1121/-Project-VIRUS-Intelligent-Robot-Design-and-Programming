P40933 affects serotonin system and exerts antidepressive effects through IL15Rα receptor . Contrary to the reduction of depressive-like behavior observed in several strains of cytokine receptor knockout mice , mice lacking the specific receptor for interleukin ( IL ) -15 showed increased immobility in tail suspension and modified forced swimming tests . There was also a reduction in social interactions . The hippocampus of the IL15Rα knockout mice had decreased mRNA for 5-HT(1A) , increased mRNA for 5-HT(2C) , and region-specific changes of serotonin reuptake transporter ( P31645 ) immunoreactivity . DB00472 ( the classic antidepressant DB00472 , which inhibits 5-HT(2C) and P31645 ) reduced the immobility of the IL15Rα knockout mice in comparison with their pretreatment baseline . Together with the unchanged performance of the IL15Rα knockout mice on the rotarod , this response to fluoxetine indicates that the immobility reflects depression . Wildtype mice responded to P40933 treatment with improvement of immobility induced by forced swimming , whereas the knockout mice failed to respond . Thus , the cognate P40933 receptor is necessary for the antidepressive activity of P40933 . In ex vivo studies , P40933 decreased synaptosomal uptake of 5-HT , and modulated the expression of 5-HT(2C) and P31645 in cultured neurons in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Thus , the effect of P40933 on serotonin transmission may underlie the depressive-like behavior of IL15Rα knockout mice . We speculate that P40933 is essential to maintain neurochemical homeostasis and thereby plays a role in preventing neuropsychiatric symptoms .
