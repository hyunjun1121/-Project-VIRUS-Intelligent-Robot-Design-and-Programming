DB05651 , a novel isotype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor , has broad spectrum antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo . Nonselective inhibitors of human histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) are known to have antitumor activity in mice in vivo , and several of them are under clinical investigation . The first of these , DB02546 ( DB02546 ) , has been approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Questions remain concerning which HDAC isotype(s) are the best to target for anticancer activity and whether increased efficacy and safety will result with an isotype-selective HDAC inhibitor . We have developed an isotype-selective HDAC inhibitor , DB05651 , which potently targets human Q13547 but also has inhibitory activity against Q92769 , O15379 , and Q96DB2 in vitro . In intact cells , DB05651 inhibited only a fraction of the total HDAC activity and showed long-lasting inhibitory activity even upon drug removal . DB05651 induced hyperacetylation of histones , selectively induced apoptosis , and caused cell cycle blockade in various human cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner . DB05651 exhibited potent and selective antiproliferative activities against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines in vitro , and HDAC inhibitory activity was required for these effects . In vivo , DB05651 significantly inhibited growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice in a dose-dependent manner and the antitumor activity correlated with induction of histone acetylation in tumors . Our findings suggest that the isotype-selective HDAC inhibition by DB05651 is sufficient for antitumor activity in vivo and that further clinical investigation is warranted .
