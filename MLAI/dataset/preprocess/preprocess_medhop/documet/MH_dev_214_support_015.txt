Transient multiple acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenation deficiency in a newborn female caused by maternal riboflavin deficiency . A newborn female presented on the first day of life with clinical and biochemical findings consistent with multiple acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenase deficiency ( Q8WXG6 ) . DB00140 supplementation corrected the biochemical abnormalities 24 h after commencing the vitamin . In vitro acylcarnitine profiling in intact fibroblasts both in normal and riboflavin depleted media showed normal oxidation of fatty acids excluding defects in electron transfer flavoprotein ( ETF ) , or ETF ubiquinone oxidoreductase ( ETF:QO ) , or a genetic abnormality in flavin metabolism . In addition , sequencing of the genes encoding ETF and ETF:QO in the proband did not reveal any pathogenic mutations . Determination of the maternal riboflavin status after delivery showed that the mother was riboflavin deficient . Repeat testing done two years after the infant 's birth and while on a normal diet showed that the mother was persistently riboflavin deficient and showed a typical Q8WXG6 profile on plasma acylcarnitine testing . A possible genetic defect in riboflavin transport of metabolism in the mother is postulated to be the cause of the transient Q8WXG6 seen in the infant . Sequencing of the Q6ZSM3 , Q969G6 and Q8NFF5 genes encoding key enzymes in riboflavin transport of metabolism in the mother did not identify any pathogenic mutations . The underlying molecular basis of the mother 's defect in riboflavin metabolism remains to be established .
