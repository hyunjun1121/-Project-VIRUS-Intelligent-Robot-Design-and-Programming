Unbiased screen for interactors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 supports a common pathway for sporadic and familial Parkinson disease . Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( Q5S007 ) cause inherited Parkinson disease ( PD ) , and common variants around Q5S007 are a risk factor for sporadic PD . Using protein-protein interaction arrays , we identified P10415 -associated athanogene 5 , Rab7L1 ( P51149 , member DB01367 oncogene family-like 1 ) , and O14976 as binding partners of Q5S007 . The latter two genes are candidate genes for risk for sporadic PD identified by genome-wide association studies . These proteins form a complex that promotes clearance of Golgi-derived vesicles through the autophagy-lysosome system both in vitro and in vivo . We propose that three different genes for PD have a common biological function . More generally , data integration from multiple unbiased screens can provide insight into human disease mechanisms .
