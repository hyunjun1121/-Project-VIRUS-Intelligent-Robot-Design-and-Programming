Endogenous expression of histamine H1 receptors functionally coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis in P13671 glioma cells : regulation by cyclic AMP . 1. The effects of histamine receptor agonists and antagonists on phospholipid hydrolysis in rat-derived P13671 glioma cells have been investigated . 2 . P35367 -stimulation caused a concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of total [ 3H ] -inositol phosphates in cells prelabelled with [ 3H ] -myo-inositol . The rank order of agonist potencies was histamine ( EC50 = 24 microM ) > N alpha-methylhistamine ( EC50 = 31 microM ) > 2-thiazolylethylamine ( EC50 = 91 microM ) . 3 . The response to 0.1 mM histamine was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by the H1-antagonists , mepyramine ( apparent Kd = 1 nM ) and (+)-chlorpheniramine ( apparent Kd = 4 nM ) . In addition , (-)-chlorpheniramine was more than two orders of magnitude less potent than its (+)-stereoisomer . 4 . Elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation with forskolin ( 10 microM , EC50 = 0.3 microM ) , isoprenaline ( 1 microM , EC50 = 4 nM ) or rolipram ( 0.5 mM ) , significantly reduced the histamine-mediated ( 0.1 mM ) inositol phosphate response by 37 % , 43 % and 26 % respectively . In contrast , 1,9-dideoxyforskolin did not increase cyclic AMP accumulation and had no effect on the phosphoinositide response to histamine . 5 . These data indicate the presence of functionally coupled , endogenous histamine H1 receptors in P13671 glioma cells . Furthermore , the results also indicate that H1 receptor-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis is inhibited by the elevation of cyclic AMP levels in these cells .
