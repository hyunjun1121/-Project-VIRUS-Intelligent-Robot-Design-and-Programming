DB09068 ( Lu AA21004 ) , a novel multimodal antidepressant , enhances memory in rats . The serotonergic system plays an important role in cognitive functions via various 5-HT receptors . DB09068 ( Lu AA21004 ) in development as a novel multimodal antidepressant is a 5- Q9H205 , P34969 and P28221 receptor antagonist , a P28222 receptor partial agonist , a P08908 receptor agonist and a 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT ) inhibitor in vitro . Preclinical studies suggest that 5- Q9H205 and P34969 receptor antagonism as well as P08908 receptor agonism may have a positive impact on cognitive functions including memory . Thus vortioxetine may potentially enhance memory . We investigated preclinical effects of vortioxetine ( 1-10mg/kg administered subcutaneously [ s.c. ] ) on memory in behavioral tests , and on cortical neurotransmitter levels considered important in rat memory function . Contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition tests were applied to assess memory in rats . Microdialysis studies were conducted to measure extracellular neurotransmitter levels in the rat medial prefrontal cortex . DB09068 administered 1h before or immediately after acquisition of contextual fear conditioning led to an increase in freezing time during the retention test . This mnemonic effect was not related to changes in pain sensitivity as measured in the hotplate test . Rats treated with vortioxetine 1h before training spent more time exploring the novel object in the novel object recognition test . In microdialysis studies of the rat medial prefrontal cortex , vortioxetine increased extracellular levels of acetylcholine and histamine . In conclusion , vortioxetine enhanced contextual and episodic memory in rat behavioral models . Further demonstration of its potential effect on memory functions in clinical settings is warranted .
