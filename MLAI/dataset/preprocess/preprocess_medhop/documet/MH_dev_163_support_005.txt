Distinct HDACs regulate the transcriptional response of human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes to Trichostatin A and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . The anti-proliferative effects of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] converge via the interaction of un-liganded vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) with co-repressors recruiting multiprotein complexes containing HDACs and via the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( CDKI ) genes of the INK4 and Cip/Kip family . We investigated the effects of the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A ( P32119 ) and DB00136 on the proliferation and CDKI gene expression in malignant and non-malignant mammary epithelial cell lines . P32119 induced the INK4-family genes p18 and p19 , whereas the Cip/Kip family gene P38936 was stimulated by DB00136 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA inhibition assays showed that the co-repressor NCoR1 and some HDAC family members complexed un-liganded P11473 and repressed the basal level of CDKI genes , but their role in regulating CDKI gene expression by P32119 and DB00136 were contrary . O15379 and HDAC7 attenuated DB00136 -dependent induction of the P38936 gene , for which NCoR1 is essential . In contrast , P32119 -mediated induction of the p18 gene was dependent on O15379 and P56524 , but was opposed by NCoR1 and un-liganded P11473 . This suggests that the attenuation of the response to P32119 by NCoR1 or that to DB00136 by HDACs can be overcome by their combined application achieving maximal induction of anti-proliferative target genes .
