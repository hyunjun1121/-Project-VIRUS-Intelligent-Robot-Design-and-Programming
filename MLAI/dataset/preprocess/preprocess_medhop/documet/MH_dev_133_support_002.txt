P35372 mutant , T394A , abolishes opioid-mediated adenylyl cyclase superactivation . This study was to characterize the effects of a point-mutant at C-terminal of mu opioid receptor ( MOR ) , namely MOR T394A , in chronic opioid-induced cellular responses . After 18 h of exposure to [ D-Ala , N-Me- DB00120 , DB00145 -ol ] enkephalin ( DAMGO ) , adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) superactivation , a hallmark for the cellular adaptive response after chronic opioid stimulation , was observed in the cells expressing wild-type receptor , but was totally abolished in the cells expressing MOR T394A . Receptor phosphorylation was also attenuated in cells with MOR T394A after prolonged preexposure to agonist . Furthermore , Q96HU1 kinase kinase-1 ( Q02750 ) overexpression was able to rescue AC superactivation in cells with MOR T394A , but showed no effect in the wild-type MOR-expressing cells . These results indicated that the amino acid T394 at C-terminus of MOR played a critical role in chronic agonist-induced AC superactivation and receptor phosphorylation .
