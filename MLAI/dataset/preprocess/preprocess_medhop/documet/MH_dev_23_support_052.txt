Synergistic inhibition of colon carcinoma cell growth by Hedgehog-Gli1 inhibitor arsenic trioxide and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 . The Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling pathway not only plays important roles in embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis , but also in tumorigenesis . Aberrant Hh pathway activation has been reported in a variety of malignant tumors including colon carcinoma . Here , we sought to investigate the regulation of the Hh pathway transcription factor Gli1 by arsenic trioxide and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 in colon carcinoma cells . We transfected cells with siGli1 and observed a significant reduction of Gli1 expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells , which was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots . Knocking down endogenous Gli1 reduced colon carcinoma cell viability through inducing cell apoptosis . Similarly , knocking down Gli2 using short interfering RNA impaired colon carcinoma cell growth in vitro . To elucidate the regulation of Gli1 expression , we found that both Gli inhibitor arsenic trioxide and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced Gli1 protein expression and colon carcinoma cell proliferation . DB01169 treatment also reduced Gli1 downstream target gene expression , such as Bcl2 and P24385 . More importantly , the inhibition of Hedgehog-Gli1 by arsenic trioxide showed synergistic anticancer effect with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in colon carcinoma cells . Our findings suggest that the Hh pathway transcription factor Gli1 is involved in the regulation of colon carcinoma cell viability . Inhibition of Hedgehog-Gli1 expression by arsenic trioxide and PI3K inhibitor synergistically reduces colon cancer cell proliferation , indicating that they could be used as an effective anti-colon cancer combination therapy .
