[ Anti-cholesterol agents , new therapeutic approaches ] . Statins and fibrates constitute the two major families of lipid-lowering agents . Statins are widely used for the treatment of pure hypercholesterolaemia while fibrates are used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia . Both drugs are also used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia . Some fibrates efficiently lower serum LDL-cholesterol . Statins inhibit P04035 and decrease cellular cholesterol synthesis . The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentration induces the activation of SREBP thus inducing the over expression and transcription of the P01130 gene . This over expression of the P01130 in the liver increases the clearance of circulating LDL thus decreasing the LDL-cholesterol plasma levels . The effects of fibrates on lipid metabolism are entirely due to their capacity to activate Q07869 and to induce the over expression of genes containing a PPRE in their promoter . Fibrates decrease triglyceride concentrations by increasing the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver and by decreasing triglyceride-VLDL synthesis . Fibrates also decrease triglycerides by increasing the hydolysys of triglycerides in chylomicron and VLDL through their capacity to increase and to decrease the lipoprotein lipase and the apo C-III transcription , respectively . Fibrates could decrease triglycerides partly by inducing apo A-V over-expression . These molecules increase HDL-cholesterol by increasing apo A-I and apo A-II transcription . Therefore the mechanisms of action of statins and fibrates depend on their capacity to modulate the expression of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism .
