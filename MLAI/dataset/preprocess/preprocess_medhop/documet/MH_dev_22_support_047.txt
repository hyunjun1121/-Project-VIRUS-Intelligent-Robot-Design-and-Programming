Population pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , a P04626 -targeted antibody-drug conjugate , in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer : clinical implications of the effect of covariates . PURPOSE : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab linked to DM1 , a highly potent cytotoxic agent . A population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis was performed to estimate typical values and interindividual variability of DB05773 PK parameters and the effects of clinically relevant covariates . METHODS : Serum samples were collected from 671 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) who received single-agent DB05773 in five phase I to phase III studies . Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with the first-order conditional estimation method was used . RESULTS : A linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment described DB05773 PKs in the clinical dose range . DB05773 elimination clearance was 0.676 L/day , volume of distribution in the central compartment ( V c ) was 3.127 L , and terminal elimination half-life was 3.94 days . Age , race , region , and renal function did not influence DB05773 PK . Given the low-to-moderate effect of all statistically significant covariates on DB05773 exposure , none of these covariates is expected to result in a clinically meaningful change in DB05773 exposure . CONCLUSIONS : DB05773 PK properties are consistent and predictable in patients . A further refinement of dose based on baseline covariates other than body weight for the current 3.6 mg/kg regimen would not yield clinically meaningful reductions in interindividual PK variability in patients with MBC .
