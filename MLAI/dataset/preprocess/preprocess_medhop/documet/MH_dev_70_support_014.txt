Changes in enzyme activity and expression of P00374 of Toxoplasma gondii by antifolates . The responses to antifolates of Toxoplasma gondii were investigated by measuring the dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) activity , quantity of P00374 mRNA , and single-strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) pattern . DB00205 ( Q9BRP8 ) and methotrexate ( MTX ) were tested as antifolates . When T. gondii was treated with Q9BRP8 , the viability was decreased by the increasing concentration of Q9BRP8 , P00374 activity tended to increase as the passage proceeded , and the quantity of mRNA expressed was also increased according to passages . The viability of T. gondii was decreased by the increasing concentration of MTX , but it was maintained over 40 % up to 100 microM MTX . P00374 activity was 77.4 % in the 1st passage ( 1 microM ) . 82.2 % in the 4th passage ( 10 microM ) , and 141.3 % in the 7th passage ( 100 microM ) . But no changes were detected in SSCP pattern of T. gondii exposed to Q9BRP8 and MTX , both . These results suggested that the response of T. gondii to Q9BRP8 was regulated by transcriptional level and that , in MTX , the viability of T. gondii was derived from increasing P00374 activity .
