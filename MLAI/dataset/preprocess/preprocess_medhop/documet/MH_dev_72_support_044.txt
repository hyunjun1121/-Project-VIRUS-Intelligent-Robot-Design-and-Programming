Systemic poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activation , chronic inflammation , and oxidative stress in P48444 patients . Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) strongly suggest a role for the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 , E.C.2.4.2.30 ) in the disease pathophysiology . P09874 is highly activated by reactive oxygen species-induced DNA strand breaks , upon which it forms extensive poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) polymers from its substrate NAD(+) . We hypothesized that in P48444 , chronic inflammation and oxidative stress would lead to systemic P09874 activation and to a reduced NAD(+) status . In a patient-control study , systemic P09874 activation was assessed by immunofluorescent detection of PAR polymers in peripheral blood lymphocytes . The percentage of PAR polymer-positive lymphocytes appeared to be higher in P48444 patients ( 27 +/- 3 % ) than in healthy age-matched controls ( 17 +/- 2 % , p < .05 ) . Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) of deproteinized plasma ( p < .001 ) , plasma uric acid ( p < .05 ) , as well as blood NAD(+) ( p < .01 ) of stable P48444 patients were significantly reduced when compared to controls . In addition , levels of proinflammatory cytokines P05231 , P10145 , and sICAM-1 were increased ( p < .005 ) in P48444 patients . In this study , evidence was found for the presence of systemic inflammation , chronic oxidative stress , and systemic P09874 activation in stable P48444 patients . These data support a contribution of oxidative stress-induced P09874 activation to the pathophysiology of P48444 .
