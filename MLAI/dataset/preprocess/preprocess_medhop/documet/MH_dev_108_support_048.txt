Tumour necrosis factor α antagonists in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis : an immunological perspective . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune conditions , affecting approximately 1 % of the adult population . It is associated with decreased quality of life and considerable morbidity and mortality . Various inflammatory cells , including macrophages , neutrophils , mast cells , natural killer cells , B and T cells and stromal cells play key pathophysiological roles in joint inflammation and RA progression . Several cytokines , including interleukin ( IL ) -1α and/or IL-1β , and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α , are involved at each stage of RA pathogenesis ; namely , by augmenting autoimmunity , sustaining long-term inflammatory synovitis and promoting joint damage . Different cell types are involved in RA pathogenesis through upregulation of several cytokine and soluble pro-inflammatory mediators . As early as the late 1980s , P01375 had been identified as a potential target in RA . Five anti- P01375 drugs , infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab pegol , etanercept and DB06674 , are now approved for the treatment of RA in various countries . All are bivalent monoclonal antibodies , with the exception of the monovalent certolizumab and etanercept , which is an engineered dimeric receptor . Although all react with and neutralise soluble P01375 in vitro , structural differences in the molecules may contribute to differences in their therapeutic effects and the occurrence of side effects . Pegylated certolizumab permits once-monthly dosing . Other mechanisms of action proposed to be important for the efficacy of anti- P01375 agents are as follows : induction of apoptosis of both monocytes and T cells ; neutralization of membrane P01375 ; antibody-dependent cell-mediated and complement-dependent cytotoxicity ; and reverse signaling via membrane P01375 .
