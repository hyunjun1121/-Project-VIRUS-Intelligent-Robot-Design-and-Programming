Recent advances in autoimmune pancreatitis : concept , diagnosis , and pathogenesis . Recent advances support the concept of autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP ) as a unique systemic disease , because it shows occasional extrapancreatic lesions such as sclerosing cholangitis , sclerosing sialoadenitis , and retroperitoneal fibrosis , pathological features similar to those of fibrosis , and abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells , and it is steroid responsive . Based on these findings , several diagnostic criteria have been proposed . Although AIP is accepted worldwide as a unique clinical entity , its pathogenetic mechanism remains unclear . To clarify its pathogenesis , its genetic background , humoral immunity , candidate target antigens including self-antigens and molecular mimicry by microbes , and cellular immunity including regulatory T cells , the complement system , and experimental models are reviewed . On the basis of this review , we hypothesize that the pathogenesis of AIP involves a biphasic mechanism consisting of " induction " and " progression . " In the early stage , the initial response to self-antigens [ lactoferrin , carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) -II , P22748 , pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor , and alpha-fodrin ] and molecular mimicry ( Helicobacter pylori ) are induced by decreased na√Øve regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , and T-helper ( Th ) 1 cells release proinflammatory cytokines [ interferon-gamma , interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , P60568 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ] . In the chronic stage , progression is supported by increased memory Tregs and Th2 immune responses . The classical complement system pathway may be activated by the IgG1 immune complex . As Tregs seem to play an important role in progression as well as in induction of the disease , further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of AIP .
