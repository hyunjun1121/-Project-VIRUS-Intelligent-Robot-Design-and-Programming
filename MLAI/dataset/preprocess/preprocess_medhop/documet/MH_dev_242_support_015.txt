Effect of selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 on lipopolysaccharide-induced hyperalgesia . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is known to increase the expression and release of various pro-inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and produce hyperalgesia . It is also well known that prostaglandins ( PGs ) , synthesised both in the periphery and centrally by P36551 isoforms , play a key role in sensitisation of nociceptors and nociceptive processing . To investigate the role of P35354 in LPS-induced hyperalgesia , parecoxib , a selective P35354 -inhibiting pro-drug , was injected intravenously 30 min before assessing hyperalgesia induced by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of LPS ( 50 microg/mouse or 25 microg/paw of rat , respectively ) . DB03166 -induced writhing and tail immersion assay in mice and paw withdrawal response to thermal and mechanical stimuli in rats were used to assess the effect of inhibition of P35354 on LPSinduced hyperalgesia . Animals showed significant hyperalgesic behavior 8 h after LPS injection . DB08439 ( up to 20 mg/kg , i.v. ) had no effect in the two acute nociceptive assays but showed marked antinociceptive activity in writhing and tail immersion assay in LPS-pretreated mice . Similarly , parecoxib reversed the hyperalgesia in the LPS-injected paw but not in the contralateral paw of rats . Pre-treatment with dexamethasone , an inhibitor of P35354 expression before LPS injection significantly affected the development of hyperalgesia in both mice and rats . These findings suggest that inducible P35354 derived PGs are involved in central nociceptive processing , which resulted in hyperalgesic behavior following LPS administration and inhibition of P35354 or its expression attenuated LPS-induced hyperalgesia .
