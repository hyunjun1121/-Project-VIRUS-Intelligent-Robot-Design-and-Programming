Internet-based behavioral activation -- treatment for postnatal depression ( Netmums ) : a randomized controlled trial . BACKGROUND : Despite the high prevalence of postnatal depression ( P01160 ) , few women seek help . The internet may increase timely access to treatment . We report a randomized controlled trial of a minimal intervention internet Behavioral Activation ( iBA ) treatment modified to address postnatal specific concerns ( Postnatal-iBA ) . METHODS : Women ( n=910 ) recruited via a popular UK parenting site , Netmums.com , scoring above 12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) were randomly assigned to receive either Postnatal-iBA delivered or treatment-as-usual ( P10636 ) . We investigated the feasibility ( recruitment , trial and treatment adherence ) and effectiveness ( depression status EPDS > 12 ) of the intervention . RESULTS : Recruitment was excellent ; 1261 women , 961 of whom met inclusion criteria , signed up to the trial within two 2-week recruitment periods . Thirty-eight percent ( 343/910 ) of women completed the 15-week outcome assessment . Of those who completed 15-week assessment , fewer exceeded the depression cutoff in the Postnatal-iBA group ( n=66/181 ) compared to P10636 ( n=91/162 ) . Assuming all non-respondents remained depressed , the Postnatal-iBA effect was reduced . LIMITATIONS : The study suffered from high attrition and future trials need to consider strategies for improving outcome completion . Some women reported struggles " keeping up " with the treatment . CONCLUSIONS : A minimal support , widely accessible internet Behavioral Activation program for P01160 is feasible to deliver to community populations when embedded within popular parenting sites . For women who provide outcome data , postnatal-iBA offers promise as an effective treatment for P01160 . The addition of support may reduce women 's struggles to keep pace with the treatment .
