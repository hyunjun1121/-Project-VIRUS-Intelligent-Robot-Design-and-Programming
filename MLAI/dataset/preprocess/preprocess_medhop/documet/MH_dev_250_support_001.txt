Q07869 gamma 2 regulates adipose expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene . DB01819 carboxykinase ( PEPCK ) is expressed at high levels in liver , kidney , and adipose tissue . This enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step in hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis and adipose glyceroneogenesis . The regulatory factors important for adipose expression of the PEPCK gene are not well defined . Previous studies with transgenic mice established that the region between bp -2086 and -888 is required for expression in adipose tissue but not for expression in liver or kidney tissue . We show here that a DNA fragment containing this region can function as an enhancer and direct differentiation-dependent expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from a heterologous promoter in cultured 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and adipocytes . We further demonstrate that the adipocyte-specific transcription factor Q07869 gamma 2 , previously identified as a regulator of the adipocyte P2 enhancer , binds in a heterodimeric complex with RXR alpha to the PEPCK 5'-flanking region at two sites , termed P35558 ( bp -451 to -439 ) and Q16822 ( bp -999 to -987 ) . Forced expression of Q07869 gamma 2 and RXR alpha activates the PEPCK enhancer in non-adipose cells . This activation is potentiated by peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids but not by 9-cis retinoic acid . Mutation of the Q07869 gamma 2 binding site ( Q16822 ) abolishes both the activity of the enhancer in adipocytes and its ability to be activated by Q07869 gamma 2 and RXR alpha . These results establish a role for Q07869 gamma 2 in the adipose expression of the PEPCK gene and suggest that this factor functions as a coordinate regulator of multiple adipocyte-specific genes .
