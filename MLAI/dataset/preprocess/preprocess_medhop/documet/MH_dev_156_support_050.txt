A case study of acenocoumarol sensitivity and genotype-phenotype discordancy explained by combinations of polymorphisms in Q9BQB6 and P11712 . To determine the cause of a genotype-phenotype discordancy for acenocoumarol sensitivity . Methods A patient , highly sensitive to acenocoumarol , and previously determined to carry only a single P11712 *3 allele , was genotyped for additional functionally defective alleles in the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes . Family members were also analyzed to trace the pedigree . Results The acenocoumarol-sensitive patient was found to possess , in addition to P11712 *3 allele , a P11712 *11 allele and the Q9BQB6 AA diplotype which were all traced back through the parental lines . Conclusions DB01418 sensitivity in this subject is the consequence of inheritance of multiple functionally defective alleles in both the P11712 and Q9BQB6 genes . The study provides additional data in support of diminished P11712 activity due to the presence of the rare *11 allele .
