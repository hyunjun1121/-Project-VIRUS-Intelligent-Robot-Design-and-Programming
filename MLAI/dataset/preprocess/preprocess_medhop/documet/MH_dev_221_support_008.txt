PPARgamma controls CD1d expression by turning on retinoic acid synthesis in developing human dendritic cells . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) expressing CD1d , a molecule responsible for lipid antigen presentation , are capable of enhancing natural killer T ( iNKT ) cell proliferation . The signals controlling CD1 expression and lipid antigen presentation are poorly defined . We have shown previously that stimulation of the lipid-activated transcription factor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )gamma , indirectly regulates CD1d expression . Here we demonstrate that PPARgamma , turns on retinoic acid synthesis by inducing the expression of retinol and retinal metabolizing enzymes such as retinol dehydrogenase 10 and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 ( O94788 ) . PPARgamma-regulated expression of these enzymes leads to an increase in the intracellular generation of all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) from retinol . DB00755 regulates gene expression via the activation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha in human DCs , and RARalpha acutely regulates CD1d expression . The retinoic acid-induced elevated expression of CD1d is coupled to enhanced iNKT cell activation . Furthermore , in vivo relevant lipids such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein can also elicit retinoid signaling leading to CD1d up-regulation . These data show that regulation of retinoid metabolism and signaling is part of the PPARgamma-controlled transcriptional events in DCs . The uncovered mechanisms allow the DCs to respond to altered lipid homeostasis by changing CD1 gene expression .
