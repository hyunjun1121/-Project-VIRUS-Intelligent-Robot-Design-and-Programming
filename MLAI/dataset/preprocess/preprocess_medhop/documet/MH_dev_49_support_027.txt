DB00104 -targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 enhanced cytotoxicity for the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma . Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( P04629 ) is a rare endocrine tumor that frequently metastasizes , but treatment with irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) is limited because of side effects . P04629 is known to overexpress the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( P30874 ) . DB00104 ( Oct ) is a somatostatin analogue that has a high binding affinity for SSTR and can be used as a tumor-targeting ligand . We prepared Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 using Oct-poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) -lipid and evaluated Oct-mediated association and cytotoxicity of the liposomes with an P04629 cell line TT . The association of higher concentrations of modified Oct-targeted liposomes with TT cells was significantly higher than PEGylated liposomes and was significantly inhibited by empty Oct-targeted liposomes but not by free Oct . With exposure for 96 h , the cytotoxicity of Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 ( IC50 : 1.05 ± 0.47 μM ) was higher than free CPT-11 ( IC50 : 3.76 ± 0.61 μM ) or PEGylated liposomal CPT-11 ( IC50 : 3.05 ± 0.28 μM ) . In addition , empty Oct-targeted liposomes showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than empty nontargeted liposomes at a concentration where free Oct did not show cytotoxicity , suggesting that Oct as a ligand showed cytotoxicity . Moreover , Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 led to significantly higher antitumor activity and prolonged the survival time compared with nontargeted liposomal and free CPT-11 at a one-third dose and lower administration times with free CPT-11 . These findings indicated that Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 may offer considerable potential for P04629 chemotherapy because cytotoxicity of both CPT-11 and Oct was enhanced by effective cellular uptake via P30874 .
