Stage-dependent inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum by potent Ca2+ and calmodulin modulators . The effects of Ca2+ channel blockers , verapamil , nicardipine and diltiazem , and of potent calmodulin ( P62158 ) inhibitors , trifluoperazine ( Q9HCM9 ) , calmidazolium , W-7 and W-5 , on Plasmodium falciparum in culture were examined . Among Ca2+ blockers , nicardipine was the most potent with the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of 4.3 microM at 72 h after culture . Parasites were more sensitive to calmidazolium and W-7 with IC50 of 3.4 and 4.5 microM , respectively , than to Q9HCM9 and W-5 . All Ca2+ blockers and P62158 inhibitors suppressed parasite development at later stages . DB00622 , diltiazem , calmidazolium and W-5 also retarded parasite development at earlier stages and/or subsequent growth following pretreatment . Verapamil , nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium reduced erythrocyte invasion by merozoites . Fluorescence microscopy with the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 revealed that nicardipine , Q9HCM9 and calmidazolium depolarized both the plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane potentials of the parasite . It is therefore considered that although all Ca2+ and P62158 antagonists tested here influence parasite development at later stages , they are multifunctional , having effects not directly associated with Ca2+ channels or P62158 .
