[ Clinical and genetic characteristics of long-livers in Moscow region ] . In Moscow region long-livers we have studied distribution of P06858 , P11597 , P02649 , F2 , P12259 , P08709 , F13 , P02675 , P17301 , P05106 , P05121 , P42898 , Q9UBK8 , HLA- Q8IUH3 , HLA-DQA1 , P01920 genes polymorphisms , associated with predisposition to age pathology . Long-livers are characterized by favorable course of cardiovascular diseases accompanied by certain genetic factors . We have established that genotype H-H- of P06858 , allele epsilon2 of P02649 , genotype CC of P42898 ( 677C > T ) , genotype TC of P05106 , genotype GA of P02675 , HLA- Q8IUH3 *11 positively correlate with longevity .
