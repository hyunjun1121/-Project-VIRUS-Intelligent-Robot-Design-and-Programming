DB00398 inhibits many kinase mutations associated with drug-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors . DB00398 has substantial clinical activity as third- or fourth-line treatment of imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) . Because sorafenib targets both angiogenesis-related kinases ( VEGFR ) and the pathogenetic kinases found in GIST ( P10721 or P16234 ) , the molecular basis for sorafenib efficacy in this setting remains unknown . We sought to determine the spectrum of activity of sorafenib against different mutant kinases associated with drug-sensitive and drug-resistant GIST . We compared the activity of imatinib and sorafenib against transiently expressed mutant forms of P10721 and P16234 , including various secondary mutations that have been identified in imatinib-resistant or sunitinib-resistant GISTs . We also examined these drugs against four GIST cell lines , three of which are imatinib resistant . In our in vitro studies , we determined that sorafenib inhibited imatinib-resistant mutations in exons encoding the DB00171 /drug-binding pocket and in exons encoding the activation loop , with the exception of substitutions at P10721 codon D816 and P16234 codon 842 . Notably our data indicate that sorafenib is more effective than imatinib or sunitinib for inhibiting the kinase activity of drug-resistant P10721 mutants ( as assessed by biochemical IC(50) ) . We hypothesize that a major determinant of the efficacy of sorafenib for treatment of advanced GIST is the activity of this agent against P10721 or P16234 -mutant kinases . These results have implications for the further development of treatments for drug-resistant GIST .
