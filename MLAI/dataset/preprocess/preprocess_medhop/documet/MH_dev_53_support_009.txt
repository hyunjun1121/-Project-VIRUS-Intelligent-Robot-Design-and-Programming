Establishment and characterization of an immature human megakaryoblastic cell line , P29074 -A2 . We have established a novel human megakaryoblastic cell line , designated as P29074 -A2 , from a patient with megakaryoblastic crisis of Philadelphia ( Ph ) chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia . P29074 -A2 cells showed positive phenotypes for periodic acid Schiff and alpha-naphthylbutyrate esterase reactions , but were negative for myeloperoxidase and naphthol P51689 chloroacetate esterase reactions . Flow cytometric analyses of cell surface markers revealed that P29074 -A2 cells had a low level of GP IIb/IIIa expression as well as apparent expressions of P01730 , P09564 , P15144 , P20138 and P28906 antigens , but no expression of GP Ib nor glycophorin A . Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) dramatically increased the expression of megakaryocyte-related markers such as P09382 -3 , J15 , Pit-1 , P28062 /51 and AN51 in P29074 -A2 cells . The PMA-stimulation also induced expression of platelet peroxidase ( P50336 ) in P29074 -A2 cells on electromicroscopic observation . Proliferative responses to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) , interleukin-3 ( P08700 ) or erythropoietin were observed , and the expression of GP IIb/IIIa was increased by stimulation with GM- P04141 , P08700 , erythropoietin and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) . Protein S mRNA expression was seen in cultured cells on Northern blot analysis . Expression of platelet factor 4 mRNA was induced in PMA-stimulated cells , and a marked accumulation of protein was observed in the culture medium . In conclusion , a new cell line , P29074 -A2 , belongs to the relatively immature megakaryocytic lineage and has markedly increased megakaryocytic characteristics with PMA stimulation .
