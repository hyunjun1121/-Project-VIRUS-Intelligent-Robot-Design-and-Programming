P15941 in macrophage : contributions to cigarette smoke-induced lung cancer . Expression of the pro-oncogenic mucin P15941 is elevated by inflammation in airway epithelial cells , but the contributions of P15941 to the development of lung cancer are uncertain . In this study , we developed our finding that cigarette smoke increases Muc1 expression in mouse lung macrophages , where we hypothesized P15941 may contribute to cigarette smoke-induced transformation of bronchial epithelial cells . In human macrophages , cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) strongly induced P15941 expression through a mechanism involving the nuclear receptor Q07869 -γ . CSE-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) activation was also required for P15941 expression , but it had little effect on P15941 transcription . RNA interference-mediated attenuation of P15941 suppressed CSE-induced secretion of P01375 -α from macrophages , by suppressing the activity of the P01375 -α-converting enzyme ( P78536 ) , arguing that P15941 is required for CSE-induced and P78536 -mediated P01375 -α secretion . Similarly , P15941 blockade after CSE induction through suppression of Q07869 -γ or P29323 inhibited P78536 activity and P01375 -α secretion . Conditioned media from CSE-treated macrophages induced P15941 expression and potentiated CSE-induced transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells in a P01375 -α-dependent manner . Together , our results identify a signaling pathway involving Q07869 -γ , P29323 , and P15941 for P01375 -α secretion induced by CSE from macrophages . Furthermore , our results show how P15941 contributes to smoking-induced lung cancers that are driven by inflammatory signals from macrophages .
