Comparison of the cytotoxicity of cladribine and clofarabine when combined with fludarabine and busulfan in AML cells : Enhancement of cytotoxicity with epigenetic modulators . Clofarabine ( Clo ) , fludarabine ( Flu ) , and busulfan ( Bu ) combinations are efficacious in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myeloid leukemia . We sought to determine whether the more affordable drug cladribine ( Clad ) can provide a viable alternative to Clo , with or without DB06603 ( Pano ) and DB01262 ( P22760 ) . Both Clad+Flu+Bu and Clo+Flu+Bu combinations showed synergistic cytotoxicity in KBM3/Bu250(6) , HL60 , and OCI- Q13950 cell lines . Cell exposure to these drug combinations resulted in 60 % -80 % inhibition of proliferation ; activation of the Q13315 pathway ; increase in histone modifications ; decrease in O15379 , P56524 , Q9UQL6 and SirT7 proteins ; decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential ; activation of apoptosis and stress signaling pathways ; and downregulation of the AKT pathway . These drug combinations activated DNA-damage response and apoptosis in primary cell samples from AML patients . At lower concentrations of Clad/Clo , Flu , and Bu , inclusion of Pano and P22760 enhanced cell killing , increased histone modifications and DNA demethylation , and increased the levels of P16/INK4a , P15/INK4b and P21/Waf1/Cip1 proteins . The observed DNA demethylating activity of Clad and Clo may complement P22760 activity ; increase demethylation of the gene promoters for Q8N474 , Q9UBP4 , and Q9Y5W5 ; and cause degradation of Î²-catenin in cells exposed to Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu+ P22760 +Pano . The overlapping activities of Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu , Pano , and P22760 in DNA-damage formation and repair , histone modifications , DNA demethylation , and apoptosis may underlie their synergism . Our results provide a basis for supplanting Clo with Clad and for including epigenetic modifiers in the pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen for myeloid leukemia patients .
