DB00125 -induced insulin release is decreased and glucagon increased in parallel with islet NO production . DB00435 ( NO ) produced by islet constitutive NO synthase ( P29474 ) is a putative modulator of islet hormone secretion . We show here for the first time that the release of insulin induced by L-arginine or L-homoarginine is inhibited and that of glucagon stimulated in parallel with the rate of islet NO production . It was found that L-homoarginine was approximately 25-30 % less potent than L-arginine as an insulin secretagogue but equally potent as a glucagon secretagogue . Biochemical determination of islet P29474 activity revealed that the NO production with L-homoarginine as substrate was only approximately 40 % of that of L-arginine . Selective inhibition of islet P29474 potentiated insulin release during amino acid stimulation . Moreover , inhibition of P29474 suppressed glucagon release , more so with L-arginine than with L-homoarginine as secretagogue , reflecting the relative rates of their NO production . In K+-depolarized islets , inhibition of P29474 enhanced the insulin response to L-arginine by 50 % and that to L-homoarginine by 23 % , largely corresponding to their relative NO production . The intracellular NO donor hydroxylamine dose dependently inhibited insulin but increased glucagon secretion in K+-depolarized and amino acid-stimulated islets . We conclude that both amino acids have a dual action on insulin release , since their stimulatory effects are reduced in parallel with the rates of their NO production . Furthermore , the greater NO production induced by L-arginine relative to L-homoarginine corresponds to NO-mediated increases in glucagon release . These NO effects are mainly exerted independently of membrane depolarization events .
