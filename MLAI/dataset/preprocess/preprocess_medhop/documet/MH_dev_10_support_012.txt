Design of novel potent antihyperlipidemic agents with antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties : exploiting phenothiazine 's strong antioxidant activity . Because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process involving a series of pathological events such as dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , and blood clotting mechanisms , we hereby report the synthesis and evaluation of novel compounds in which antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and squalene synthase ( P37268 ) inhibitory/hypolipidemic activities are combined in simple molecules through design . The coupling of two different pharmacophores afforded compounds 1-12 , whose biological profile was markedly improved compared to those of parent lead structures ( i.e. , the hypolipidemic 2-hydroxy-2-aryl-(benzo)oxa ( or thia ) zine and the antioxidant phenothiazine ) . Most derivatives strongly inhibited in vitro microsomal lipid and LDL peroxidation , exhibiting potent free-radical scavenging activity . They further significantly inhibited P37268 activity and showed remarkable antidyslipidemic activity in vivo in animal models of acute and high-fat-induced hyperlipidemia . Finally , several compounds showed anti-inflammatory activity in vitro , inhibiting cycloxygenase ( P23219 /2 ) activity . The multimodal properties of the new compounds and especially their combined antioxidant/ P37268 / P36551 inhibitory activity render them interesting lead compounds for further evaluation against atherosclerosis .
