Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 and -3 with cediranib ( DB04849 ) : effects on migration and invasion of gastrointestinal cancer cell lines . The effect of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) ligands and cediranib on tumor cell proliferation , migration , and invasion was determined . It has recently been suggested that autocrine signaling through the P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) pathway may play a role in tumor cell survival , invasion , and migration . The purpose of the present study was to determine the expression of VEGFRs and VEGFR ligands in a panel of gastrointestinal carcinoma cells . Additionally , we evaluated the effects of P15692 autocrine signaling on tumor cell proliferation , migration , and invasion utilizing cediranib ( DB04849 ) , a pan-VEGFR inhibitor . Five colorectal , three pancreatic , and two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were screened for VEGFR and P15692 expression by several methods . Expression of P17948 and P35916 was cell line-dependent , whereas P35968 was not detected . Secretion of P15692 was detected in the supernatants of all cell lines whereas P49767 secretion was detected in the Panc-1 , MiaPaca2 , and Hep1 cells only . Tumor cells showed increased migratory activity , but not proliferation , when stimulated with VEGFs . The pan-VEGFR inhibitor cediranib ( 100 nmol/L ) inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion , with no effects on proliferation . Cediranib decreased P17948 and P35916 phosphorylation as well as activation of downstream effectors . P17948 and P35916 expression was detected in all the gastrointestinal carcinoma cells evaluated . Although activation of the P15692 pathway did not affect cell proliferation , our data indicate that this pathway seems to play a role in tumor cell migration and invasion in these cell lines . Therefore , inhibition of VEGFR by cediranib may represent a clinically relevant treatment option for gastrointestinal tumors .
