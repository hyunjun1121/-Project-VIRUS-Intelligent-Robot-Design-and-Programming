cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors in the localization of mRNA for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins . mRNA localization is a conserved post-transcriptional process crucial for a variety of systems . Although several mechanisms have been identified , emerging evidence suggests that most transcripts reach the protein functional site by moving along cytoskeleton elements . We demonstrated previously that mRNA for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are asymmetrically distributed in the cytoplasm , and that localization in the proximity of mitochondria is mediated by the 3'-UTR . Here we show by biochemical analysis that these mRNA transcripts are associated with the cytoskeleton through the microtubule network . Cytoskeleton association is functional for their intracellular localization near the mitochondrion , and the 3'-UTR is involved in this cytoskeleton-dependent localization . To identify the minimal elements required for localization , we generated DNA constructs containing , downstream from the GFP gene , deletion mutants of mitochondrial ribosomal protein P28222 3'-UTR , and expressed them in HeLa cells . RT-PCR analysis showed that the localization signals responsible for mRNA localization are located in the first 154 nucleotides . RNA pull-down assays , mass spectrometry , and Q96LT9 immunoprecipitation assay experiments , demonstrated that mitochondrial ribosomal protein P28222 3'-UTR interacts specifically with TRAP1 ( tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein1 ) , hnRNPM4 ( heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M4 ) , Hsp70 and P10809 ( heat shock proteins 70 and 60 ) , and alpha-tubulin in vitro and in vivo .
