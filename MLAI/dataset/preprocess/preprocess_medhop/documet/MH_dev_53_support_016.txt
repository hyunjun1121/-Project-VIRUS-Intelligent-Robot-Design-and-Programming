Design and synthesis of an orally bioavailable and selective peptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor ( PR-047 ) . Proteasome inhibition has been validated as a therapeutic modality in the treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . DB08889 , an epoxyketone currently undergoing clinical trials in malignant diseases , is a highly selective inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like ( CT-L ) activity of the proteasome . A chemistry effort was initiated to discover orally bioavailable analogues of carfilzomib , which would have potential for improved dosing flexibility and patient convenience over intravenously administered agents . The lead compound , 2-Me-5-thiazole- DB00133 (OMe)- DB00133 (OMe)- DB00120 -ketoepoxide ( 58 ) ( PR-047 ) , selectively inhibited CT-L activity of both the constitutive proteasome ( beta5 ) and immunoproteasome ( P28062 ) and demonstrated an absolute bioavailability of up to 39 % in rodents and dogs . It was well tolerated with repeated oral administration at doses resulting in > 80 % proteasome inhibition in most tissues and elicited an antitumor response equivalent to intravenously administered carfilzomib in multiple human tumor xenograft and mouse syngeneic models . The favorable pharmacologic profile supports its further development for the treatment of malignant diseases .
