Estrogenic chemicals at puberty change ERalpha in the hypothalamus of male and female rats . The effects of two environmental endocrine disruptors , the synthetic pharmaceutical estrogen DB00977 ( EE ) and bisphenol-A ( Q03001 ) , were analysed in male and female rats in a very sensitive developmental period , puberty . Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate changes in the number of cells expressing estrogen receptors ( P03372 ) in the arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , ventromedial nucleus ( VMH ) and medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the hypothalamus . Animals were treated during early puberty , from P01160 23 to P01160 30 , with EE and Q03001 given orally every day . They were then sacrificed and perfused on P01160 37 or P01160 90 , and blood and brains were collected for hormonal determination ( testosterone and estradiol ) and immunohistochemistry ( estrogen receptors , ER ) . At P01160 37 , ER-labelled neurons were higher in males than in females in the ARC and DB00603 . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the ARC and DB00603 . At P01160 90 , females showed higher ER-labelled neurons in the VMH . EE and Q03001 increased ER-labelled neurons in the DB00603 in females . EE increased testosterone in males at P01160 37 and estradiol in females at P01160 90 . These results indicate the ability of estrogenic chemicals to change the reproductive neural circuits during puberty in male and female rats .
