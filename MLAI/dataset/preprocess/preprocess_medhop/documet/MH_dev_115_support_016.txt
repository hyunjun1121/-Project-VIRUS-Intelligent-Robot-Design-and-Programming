DB04998 inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) by forming a complex with NF-kappaB essential modulator ( Q9Y6K9 ) and nucleolin . DB04998 , also known as DB04998 , is an experimental anticancer drug that recently entered human clinical trials . It is a member of a novel class of antiproliferative agents known as G-rich oligonucleotides ( P09341 ) , which are non-antisense , guanosine-rich phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides that form stable G-quadruplex structures . The biological activity of GROs results from their binding to specific cellular proteins as aptamers . One important target protein of GROs has been previously identified as nucleolin , a multifunctional protein expressed at high levels by cancer cells . Here , we report that DB04998 also associates with nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) essential modulator ( Q9Y6K9 ) , which is a regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of kappaB ( IkappaB ) kinase ( IKK ) complex , and also called IKKgamma . In the classic NF-kappaB pathway , the IKK complex is required for phosphorylation of P25963 and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB . We found that treatment of cancer cells with DB04998 inhibits IKK activity and reduces phosphorylation of P25963 in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation . Using a reporter gene assay , we showed that DB04998 blocks both tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and constitutive NF-kappaB activity in human cancer cell lines derived from cervical , prostate , breast , and lung carcinomas . In addition , we showed that , in DB04998 -treated cancer cells , Q9Y6K9 is coprecipitated by nucleolin , indicating that both proteins are present in the same complex . Our studies suggest that abrogation of NF-kappaB activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of DB04998 and that nucleolin may play a previously unknown role in regulating the NF-kappaB pathway .
