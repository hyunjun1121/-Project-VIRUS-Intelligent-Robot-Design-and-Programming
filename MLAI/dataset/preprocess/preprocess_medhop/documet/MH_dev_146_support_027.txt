Case of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B with probable ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting liver metastasis from medullary thyroid carcinoma . A 31 year old woman was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) 2B at 10 years old . Dark pigmentation gradually developed on her skin and her serum adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) was high , suggesting concurrent ectopic DB01285 syndrome ( EAS ) . P06850 ( P06850 ) loading test ruled out Cushing 's disease and supported the diagnosis of EAS . Multiple low attenuation mass in the liver was observed in a computed tomography ( CT ) scan , and was suspected as ectopic DB01285 -secreting metastatic tumor from medullary thyroid carcinoma ( P04629 ) . DB01285 production by P04629 is relatively rare , particularly in patients with MEN ; patients with ectopic DB01285 -secreting liver metastatic tumor from P04629 in MEN 2B have never been reported previously .
