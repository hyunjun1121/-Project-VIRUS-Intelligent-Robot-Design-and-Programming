Blood gene expression profiling of breast cancer survivors experiencing fibrosis . PURPOSE : To extend knowledge on the mechanisms and pathways involved in maintenance of radiation-induced fibrosis ( Q9HBH0 ) by performing gene expression profiling of whole blood from breast cancer ( BC ) survivors with and without fibrosis 3-7 years after end of radiotherapy treatment . METHODS AND MATERIALS : Gene expression profiles from blood were obtained for 254 BC survivors derived from a cohort of survivors , treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer 3-7 years earlier . Analyses of transcriptional differences in blood gene expression between BC survivors with fibrosis ( n=31 ) and BC survivors without fibrosis ( n=223 ) were performed using R version 2.8.0 and tools from the Bioconductor project . Gene sets extracted through a literature search on fibrosis and breast cancer were subsequently used in gene set enrichment analysis . RESULTS : Substantial differences in blood gene expression between BC survivors with and without fibrosis were observed , and 87 differentially expressed genes were identified through linear analysis . Transforming growth factor-β1 signaling was identified as the most significant gene set , showing a down-regulation of most of the core genes , together with up-regulation of a transcriptional activator of the inhibitor of fibrinolysis , P05121 in the BC survivors with fibrosis . CONCLUSION : Transforming growth factor-β1 signaling was found down-regulated during the maintenance phase of fibrosis as opposed to the up-regulation reported during the early , initiating phase of fibrosis . Hence , once the fibrotic tissue has developed , the maintenance phase might rather involve a deregulation of fibrinolysis and altered degradation of extracellular matrix components .
