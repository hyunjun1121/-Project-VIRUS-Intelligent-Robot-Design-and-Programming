Constellation of HCN channels and DB02527 regulating proteins in dendritic spines of the primate prefrontal cortex : potential substrate for working memory deficits in schizophrenia . Schizophrenia associates with impaired prefrontal cortical ( P27918 ) function and alterations in cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) signaling pathways . These include genetic insults to disrupted-in-schizophrenia ( Q9NRI5 ) and phosphodiesterases ( PDE4s ) regulating DB02527 hydrolysis , and increased dopamine D1 receptor ( D1R ) expression that elevates DB02527 . We used immunoelectron microscopy to localize Q9NRI5 , P27815 , Q07343 , and D1R in monkey P27918 and to view spatial interactions with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN ) channels that gate network inputs when opened by DB02527 . Physiological interactions between PDE4s and HCN channels were tested in recordings of P27918 neurons in monkeys performing a spatial working memory task . The study reveals a constellation of DB02527 -related proteins ( Q9NRI5 , P27815 , and D1R ) and HCN channels next to excitatory synapses and the spine neck in thin spines of superficial P27918 , where working memory microcircuits interconnect and spine loss is most evident in schizophrenia . In contrast , channels in dendrites were distant from synapses and DB02527 -related proteins , and were associated with endosomal trafficking . The data suggest that a DB02527 signalplex is selectively positioned in the spines to gate P27918 pyramidal cell microcircuits . Single-unit recordings confirmed physiological interactions between DB02527 and HCN channels , consistent with gating actions . These data may explain why P27918 networks are especially vulnerable to genetic insults that dysregulate DB02527 signaling .
