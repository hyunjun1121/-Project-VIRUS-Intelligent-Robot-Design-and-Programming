Contribution of the Box 1 and Box 2 motifs of cytokine receptors to Jak1 association and activation . Kinases of the Jak family ( Jak1/2/3 and Tyk2 ) interact with the membrane proximal domain of different cytokine receptors and play a critical role in the activation of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways . In this report we demonstrate that both the Box 1 and Box 2 motif collaborate in the association and activation of Jak1 by type I interferons . Mutational analysis of the beta chain of type I interferon receptor ( IFNalphaRbetaL/ P48551 ) revealed that Box 1 plays a more significant role in activation than in the association with Jak1 . On the contrary , the Box 2 motif contributes more to the association with Jak1 than to kinase activation . Additionally , the study of the Jak1 binding sites on the P60568 receptor beta ( IL2Rbeta ) , IFNgammaRalpha/ P15260 , and IL10Ralpha/IL10R1 chains suggests that cytokine receptors have two different kinds of interaction with Jak1 . One form of interaction involves the Box 1 and the previously described Box 2 motif , which we now designate as Box 2A , characterized by the VEVI and LEVL sequences present in IFNalphaRbetaL/ P48551 and IL2Rbeta subunits , respectively . The second form of interaction requires a motif termed Box 2B , which is present in the IFNgammaRalpha/ P15260 ( SILLPKS ) and IL10Ralpha/IL10R1 ( SVLLFKK ) chains . Interestingly , Box 2B localizes close to the membrane region ( 8-10 amino acids from the membrane ) similar to Box 1 , whereas Box 2A is more distal ( 38-58 amino acids from the membrane ) .
