Could treatment with arundic acid ( DB05343 ) increase vulnerability for depression ? Arundic acid ( DB05343 ) is believed to be neuroprotective because of its actions on glia cells ; i.e. , its inhibitory effects on the synthesis of a calcium-binding protein P04271 . DB05343 is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of patients with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease . Recent clinical studies point to a pervasive comorbidity of depression with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease . Previously , P04271 has been implicated in the pathobiological mechanisms of depression . Preclinical studies have shown that antidepressant treatment significantly increases brain P04271 . Here we hypothesize that available data that link P04271 with depression , along with the proposed inhibitory action of DB05343 on P04271 synthesis , indicate that this compound could increase vulnerability for depression in patients at risk for this disorder , and we propose that evaluation of patients with stroke and Alzheimer 's disease for the presence of depression should be routine in clinical trials employing DB05343 . Although it may be open for discussion whether the neuroprotective effects of DB05343 are exclusively due to its inhibition of P04271 synthesis , the latter action of DB05343 warrants studies of the effects of this drug in the pathobiology of depression .
