DB01197 inhibits the fluorescence development associated with glycation of proteins . Albumin and immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) show increased visible fluorescence in diabetic patients , IgG fluorescence being correlated with the presence of diabetic retinopathy . DB01197 , an angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , has free radical scavenging ability , attributable to its thiol group . We compared the scavenging effect of captopril ( at doses between 0.5 and 100 microM ) with perindoprilat , enalapril and enalaprilat ( P12821 inhibitors without scavenging ability ) and two thiol-containing compounds , mercaptopropionylglycine ( P29372 ) and DB06151 ( Q9C000 ) ( scavengers with no effect on P12821 ) . Three systems were used to generate visible fluorescence in albumin and IgG ; glycation , exposure to copper/hydrogen peroxide and gamma radiation . All three thiol-containing compounds inhibited fluorescence development in IgG and albumin , when fluorescence was generated by glycation or gamma radiation . Other P12821 inhibitors had no effect with IgG . Enalapril and perindoprilat showed less effect than captopril with albumin ; enalaprilat had no effect . No compound had any effect on fluorescence generation by copper/hydrogen peroxide . DB01197 may have an additional antioxidant effect compared to other P12821 inhibitors .
