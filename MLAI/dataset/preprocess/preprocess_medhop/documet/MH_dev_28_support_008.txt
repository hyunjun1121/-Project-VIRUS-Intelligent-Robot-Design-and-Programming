Development and evaluation of high throughput functional assay methods for Q12809 potassium channel . Three functional hERG channel assay methods have been developed and evaluated . The methods were tested against five known hERG channel inhibitors : dofetilide , terfenadine ( Seldane ) , sertindole ( DB06144 ) , astemizole ( Hismanal ) , and cisapride ( Propulsid ) . The DiBAC4(3)-based assays were found to be the most economical but had high false-hit rates as a result of the interaction of dye with the test compounds . The membrane potential dye assay had fewer color-quenching problems but was expensive and still gave false hits . The nonradioactive Rb+ efflux assay was the most sensitive of all the assays evaluated and had the lowest false-hit rate .
