DB08860 suppresses acute and chronic rejection in murine cardiac allografts . INTRODUCTION : P04035 inhibitors play several roles in the maintenance of organ transplants . We investigated the role of pitavastatin , a potent and newly developed P04035 inhibitor , in cardiac allograft rejection and mechanism of graft arterial disease ( Q99259 ) suppression . METHODS : Balb/c mice hearts were transplanted into C3H/He mice ( a full allomismatch combination ) to assess acute rejection or C57BL/6 hearts into B6.C-H2 ( < bm12 > ) KhEg ( a class II mismatch combination ) to examine the extent of Q99259 . DB08860 was administered orally to mice everyday ( 3 mg/kg/day ) . To assess the effect in acute rejection , mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed and cytokine mRNA expression was examined with ribonuclease protection assay . RESULTS : DB08860 significantly prolonged allograft survival . Lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited by pitavastatin , and RPA showed down-regulation of interleukin-6 in pitavastatin-treated cardiac allografts . Allografts in the pitavastatin-treated group after 8 weeks showed less Q99259 compared with the control group . In vitro , pitavastatin suppressed the smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to activated T cells and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation . CONCLUSION : DB08860 could be effective in the suppression of acute rejection and Q99259 development in cardiac transplantation .
