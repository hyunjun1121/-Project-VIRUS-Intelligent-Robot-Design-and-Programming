Acute diabetes insipidus mediated by vasopressinase after placental abruption . CONTEXT : Postpartum , diabetes insipidus ( DI ) can be part of Sheehan 's syndrome or lymphocytic hypophysitis in combination with anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies . In contrast , acute onset of isolated DI in the postpartum period is unusual . CASE PRESENTATION : This patient presented at 33 weeks gestation with placental abruption , prompting a cesarean delivery of twins . Immediately after delivery , she developed severe DI . The DI could be controlled with the vasopressinase-resistant DB00035 ( DB00035 ) , but not with arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , and it resolved within a few weeks . OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the postpartum DI in this patient was caused by the release of placental vasopressinase into the maternal bloodstream . METHODS AND RESULTS : Cells were transiently transfected with the AVP receptor 2 ( P30518 ) and treated with either AVP or DB00035 in the presence of the patient 's serum collected postpartum or 10 weeks after delivery . The response to the different treatments was evaluated by measuring the activity of a DB02527 -responsive firefly luciferase reporter construct . The in vitro studies demonstrate that the patient 's postpartum serum disrupts activation of the P30518 by AVP , but not by the vasopressinase-resistant DB00035 . CONCLUSIONS : Placental abruption can rarely be associated with acute postpartum DI caused by release of placental vasopressinase into the bloodstream . This clinical entity must be considered in patients with placental abruption and when evaluating patients presenting with DI after delivery .
