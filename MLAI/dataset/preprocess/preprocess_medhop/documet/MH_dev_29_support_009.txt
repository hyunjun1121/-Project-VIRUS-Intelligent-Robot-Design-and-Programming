The food colorant erythrosine is a promiscuous protein-protein interaction inhibitor . Following our observation that erythrosine B ( FD & C Red No. 3 ) is a relatively potent inhibitor of the P01375 -R-TNFα and P25942 -CD154 protein-protein interactions , we investigated whether this inhibitory activity extends to any other protein-protein interactions ( PPI ) as well as whether any other approved food colors possess such inhibitory activity . We found erythrosine , a poly-iodinated xanthene dye , to be a non-specific promiscuous inhibitor of a number of PPIs within the tumor necrosis factor superfamily ( P01375 -R-TNFα , P25942 -CD154 , Q96RJ3 - Q9Y275 , Q9Y6Q6 - O14788 , OX40- P23510 , 4-1BB- P41273 ) as well as outside of it ( P01133 -R- P01133 ) with a remarkably consistent median inhibitory concentration ( IC(50) ) in the 2-20 μM ( approximately 2-20mg/L ) range . In agreement with this , erythrosine also showed cellular effects including clear cytotoxic effects around this concentration range ( IC₅₀≈50 μM ) . Among the seven FDA-approved food colorants , only erythrosine showed consistent PPI inhibitory activity in the sub-100 μM range , which might also explain ( at least partially ) why it also has the lowest approved acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) ( 0.1 mg/kg body weight/day ) . Among a number of xanthene structural analogs of erythrosine tested for activity , rose Bengal , a food colorant approved in Japan , showed similar , maybe even more pronounced , promiscuous inhibitory activity , whereas fluorescein was inactive and gallein , phloxine , and eosin were somewhat active in some of the assays .
