Vasorelaxant activity of some structurally related triterpenic acids from Phoradendron reichenbachianum ( Viscaceae ) mainly by NO production : ex vivo and in silico studies . The aim of the current study was to investigate the vasorelaxant activity of five structurally-related triterpenic acids namely ursolic ( 1 ) , moronic ( 2 ) , morolic ( 3 ) , betulinic ( 4 ) and 3,4-seco-olean-18-ene-3,28-dioic ( 5 ) acids . The vasorelaxant effect of compounds 1-5 were determined on endothelium-denuded and endothelium-intact rat aortic rings pre-contracted with noradrenaline ( 0.1 μM ) . All compounds showed significant relaxant effect on endothelium-intact vessels in a concentration-dependent manner ( p < 0.05 ) . Ursolic , moronic and betulinic acids were the most potent vasorelaxant agents with 11.7 , 16.11 and 58.46 μM , respectively . Since vasorelaxation was blocked by L-NAME , while indomethacin did not inhibit the effect , endothelium-derived nitric oxide seems to be involved in triterpenic 2 and 3 mode of action . Compounds 1-5 were docked with a crystal structure of P29474 . Triterpenes 1-5 showed calculated affinity with P29474 in the C1 and P06681 binding pockets , near the catalytic site ; Ser248 and Asp480 are the residues that make hydrogen bonds with the triterpene compounds .
