Differential regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by interferon gamma in mast cells and epithelial cells . P13569 ( P13569 ) is a P13569 in epithelial cells ; recently , we identified it in mast cells . Previous work that we confirmed showed that interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) down-regulated P13569 expression in epithelial cells ( T84 ) , but by contrast , we found that IFNgamma up-regulated P13569 mRNA and protein expression in rat and human mast cells . IFNgamma up-regulation of P13569 in mast cells was inhibited by p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) kinase inhibitors but not a Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)2 inhibitor , whereas in T84 cells IFNgamma-mediated down-regulation of P13569 was O60674 -dependent and P29323 - and p38-independent . Furthermore , IFNgamma down-regulation of P13569 in T84 epithelial cells was P42224 -dependent , but up-regulation of P13569 in mast cells was P42224 -independent . Thus , differential regulatory pathways of P13569 expression in mast cells and epithelial cells exist that depend upon either p38/ P29323 or JAK/ P35610 pathways , respectively . Surprisingly , IFNgamma treatment of mast cells inhibited Cl(-) efflux , in contrast to up-regulation of P13569 /mRNA and protein expression . However , down-regulation of Cl(-) flux correlated with IFNgamma-mediated inhibition of mediator secretion . This and other work suggests that the effect of IFNgamma on P13569 expression in mast cells is important for their function .
