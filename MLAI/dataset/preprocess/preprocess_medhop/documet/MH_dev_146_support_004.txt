Inhibition of the liver expression of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase increases the expression of angiogenic factors in cholangiocytes . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Reduction of biliary serotonin N-acetyltransferase ( Q16613 ) expression and melatonin administration/secretion in cholangiocytes increases biliary proliferation and the expression of SR , P13569 and Cl(-)/HCO3 ( - ) P04920 . The balance between biliary proliferation/damage is regulated by several autocrine neuroendocrine factors including vascular endothelial growth factor-A/C ( P15692 /C ) . VEGFs are secreted by several epithelia , where they modulate cell growth by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms . No data exists regarding the effect of Q16613 modulation on the expressions of VEGFs by cholangiocytes . METHODS : In this study , we evaluated the effect of local modulation of biliary Q16613 expression on the cholangiocytes synthesis of P15692 /C . RESULTS : The decrease in Q16613 expression and subsequent lower melatonin secretion by cholangiocytes was associated with increased expression of P15692 /C . Overexpression of Q16613 in cholangiocyte lines decreased the expression of P15692 /C . CONCLUSIONS : Modulation of melatonin synthesis may affect the expression of P15692 /C by cholangiocytes and may modulate the hepatic microvascularization through the regulation of P15692 /C expression regulating biliary functions .
