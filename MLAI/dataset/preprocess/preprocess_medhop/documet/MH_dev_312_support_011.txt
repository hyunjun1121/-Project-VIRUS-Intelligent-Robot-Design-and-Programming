(-)- DB03823 -3-gallate ameliorates learning and memory deficits by adjusting the balance of TrkA/p75NTR signaling in P05067 / P49768 transgenic mice . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is pathologically characterized by deposition of β-amyloid ( Aβ ) peptides , which closely correlates with the balance of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) -related TrkA/p75NTR signaling . (-)- DB03823 -3-gallate ( EGCG ) is used for prevention and treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases , including AD . However , whether the neuroprotective effects of EGCG treatment were via modulating the balance of TrkA/p75NTR signaling was still unknown . In this study , we found that EGCG treatment ( 2 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) ) dramatically ameliorated the cognitive impairments , reduced the overexpressions of Aβ(1-40) and amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) , and inhibited the neuronal apoptosis in the P05067 / P49768 mice . Interestingly , the EGCG treatment enhanced the relative expression level of P01138 by increasing the P01138 /proNGF ratio in the P05067 / P49768 mice . Moreover , after EGCG treatment , TrkA signaling was activated by increasing the phosphorylation of TrkA following the increased phosphorylation of c-Raf , P27361 /2 , and DB02527 response element-binding protein ( CREB ) , simultaneously the p75NTR signaling was significantly inhibited by decreasing the p75ICD expression , P45984 phosphorylation , and cleaved-caspase 3 expression , so that the Aβ deposits and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus were inhibited .
