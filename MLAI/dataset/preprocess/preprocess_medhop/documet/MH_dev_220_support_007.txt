Hyperosmolar mannitol simulates expression of aquaporins 4 and 9 through a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway in rat astrocytes . The membrane pore proteins , aquaporins ( AQPs ) , facilitate the osmotically driven passage of water and , in some instances , small solutes . Under hyperosmotic conditions , the expression of some AQPs changes , and some studies have shown that the expression of P29972 and P55064 is regulated by MAPKs . However , the mechanisms regulating the expression of P55087 and AQP9 induced by hyperosmotic stress are poorly understood . In this study , we observed that hyperosmotic stress induced by mannitol increased the expression of P55087 and AQP9 in cultured rat astrocytes , and intraperitoneal infusion of mannitol increased P55087 and AQP9 in the rat brain cortex . In addition , a p38 MAPK inhibitor , but not P29323 and JNK inhibitors , suppressed their expression in cultured astrocytes . AQPs play important roles in maintaining brain homeostasis . The expression of P55087 and AQP9 in astrocytes changes after brain ischemia or traumatic injury , and some studies have shown that p38 MAPK in astrocytes is activated under similar conditions . Since mannitol is commonly used to reduce brain edema , understanding the regulation of AQPs and p38 MAPK in astrocytes under hyperosmotic conditions induced with mannitol may lead to a control of water movements and a new treatment for brain edema .
