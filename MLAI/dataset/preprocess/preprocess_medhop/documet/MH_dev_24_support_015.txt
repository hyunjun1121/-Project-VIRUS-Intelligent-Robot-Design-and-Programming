Possible involvement of endocannabinoids in the increase of morphine consumption in maternally deprived rat . Whether adolescent exposure to chronic DB00470 ( THC ) facilitates progression to opioid consumption is still controversial . In a maternal deprivation model ( 3 h daily from postnatal day 1-14 ) , we previously reported that adolescent exposure to chronic THC blocks morphine dependence in maternally deprived ( D ) rats . Owing to the existence of a functional cross-interaction between the opioid and cannabinoid systems in reward , we evaluated if the vulnerability to opiate reward in D rats , may involve an alteration of the endocannabinoid system . Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol ( 2-AG ) , were quantified in the striatum and mesencephalon of adolescent and adult D and non-deprived ( animal facility rearing , AFR ) rats by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . Oral morphine self-administration behavior was analyzed for 14 weeks , 24 days after chronic injection of the cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist , SR141716A ( 3 mg/kg ) for 2 weeks during adolescence ( P01160 35-48 ) . Adolescent D rats exhibited higher basal levels of anandamide than adolescent AFR rats in the nucleus accumbens ( 38 % ) , the caudate-putamen nucleus ( 62 % ) and the mesencephalon ( 320 % ) , whereas adult D rats showed an increase of anandamide and 2-AG levels in the nucleus accumbens ( 50 % and 24 % , respectively ) and of 2-AG in the caudate-putamen nucleus ( 48 % ) , compared to adult AFR rats . Chronic administration of SR141716A to adolescent D rats blocked the escalation behavior in the morphine consumption test . Our data suggest that altered brain endocannabinoid levels may contribute to the escalation behavior in the morphine consumption test in a maternal deprivation model .
