[ c- DB00134 signaling pathway participating in the gefitinib resistance of different gene types of non-small cell lung cancer cells induced by P14210 in vitro ] . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : It has been known that hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) induces gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . The possible mechanism may be related to the activation of the P08581 c- DB00134 . The aim of this study is to investigate the involvement of c- DB00134 and its downstream signaling pathway in the P14210 -induced gefitinib resistance of NSCLC cells with different epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) gene types . METHODS : NSCLC cell lines with different P00533 genes ( PC-9 , Q8NBP7 /R , H292 , and A549 ) were selected and induced by P14210 . Cell survival was determined by MTT assay and the expression of DB00134 and downstream signaling proteins were examined by Western blot . RESULTS : Gefitinib inhibited the cell growth of Q8NBP7 , H292 , and A549 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner . The concentration-survival curve notably shifted to the right when induced by P14210 . The apoptotic rate was lower when the cells were treated with P14210 and gefitinib than when these cells were treated with gefitinib alone ( P < 0.05 ) , particularly in Q8NBP7 , H292 , and A549 cells , but not in Q8NBP7 /R . P14210 stimulated the phosphorylation of DB00134 and downstream signaling proteins in Q8NBP7 , H292 , Q8NBP7 /R , and A549 cell lines . p- DB00134 , p-Akt , p-Stat3 , and p-Erk1/2 expressions were higher when the cells were treated with P14210 and gefitinib than when these cells were treated with gefitinib alone , particularly in Q8NBP7 , H292 , and A549 cells , but not in Q8NBP7 /R . CONCLUSIONS : c- DB00134 and its downstream signaling pathway possibly participated in the P14210 -induced gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells with different P00533 gene types .
