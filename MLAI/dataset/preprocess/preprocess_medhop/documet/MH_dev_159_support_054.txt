JTT-705 blocks cell proliferation and angiogenesis through p38 kinase/p27(kip1) and Ras/ P38936 (waf1) pathways . The excessive proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) participate in the growth and instability of atherosclerotic plaque . We examined the direct role of a newly developed chemical inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein , JTT-705 , on SMC proliferation and angiogenesis in endothelial cells ( ECs ) . JTT-705 inhibited human coronary artery SMC proliferation . JTT-705 induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases ( P29323 ) in SMCs . In addition , the anti-proliferative effects of JTT-705 in SMCs were blocked by p38 MAPK inhibitor . JTT-705 induced the upregulation of p- P38936 (waf1) , and this effect was blocked by dominant-negative Ras ( N17 ) , but not by inhibitors of p38 MAPK or P29323 . In addition , JTT-705 also induced the upregulation of p27(kip1) , and this effect was blocked by p38 MAPK inhibitor . Interestingly , culture medium from JTT-705-treated SMCs blocked human coronary artery EC tube formation in an in vitro model of angiogenesis indirectly via a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) from SMCs and directly via an anti-proliferative effect in ECs . JTT-705 blocked the proliferation of SMCs through the activation of p38 kinase/p27(kip1) and Ras/ P38936 (waf1) pathways , and simultaneously blocked EC tube formation associated with a decrease in P15692 production from SMCs and an anti-proliferative effect in ECs . Our results indicate that JTT-705 may induce a direct anti-atherogenic effect in addition to its inhibitory effect of P11597 activity .
