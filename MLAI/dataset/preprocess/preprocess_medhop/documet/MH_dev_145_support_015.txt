Design and application of a novel PNA probe for the detection at single cell level of JAK2V617F mutation in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms . BACKGROUND : Mutation(s) of the O60674 gene ( V617F ) has been described in a significant proportion of Philadelphia negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( Q9BQR3 ) patients and its detection is now a cornerstone in the diagnostic algorithm . METHODS : We developed a novel assay based on peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) technology coupled to immuno-fluorescence microscopy ( PNA- Q5TCZ1 ) for the specific detection at a single cell level of O60674 -mutation thus improving both the diagnostic resolution and the study of clonal prevalence . RESULTS : Using this assay we found a percentage of mutated P28906 + cells ranging from 40 % to 100 % in Polycythemia Vera patients , from 15 % to 80 % in Essential Thrombocythemia and from 25 % to 100 % in Primary Myelofibrosis . This method allows to distinguish , with a high degree of specificity , at single cell level , between P28906 + progenitor stem cells harbouring the mutated or the wild type form of O60674 in P06748 patients . CONCLUSIONS : This method allows to identify multiple gene abnormalities which will be of paramount relevance to understand the pathophysiology and the evolution of any type of cancer .
