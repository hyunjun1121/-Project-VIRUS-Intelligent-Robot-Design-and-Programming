Altered relationship of plasma triglycerides to HDL cholesterol in patients with HIV/HAART-associated dyslipidemia : further evidence for a unique form of metabolic syndrome in HIV patients . INTRODUCTION : Plasma triglycerides ( TG ) and HDL-C are inversely related in Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) , due to exchange of VLDL-TG for HDL-cholesteryl esters catalyzed by cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) . We investigated the relationship of TG to HDL-C in highly-active antiretroviral drug ( HAART ) -treated HIV patients . METHODS : Fasting plasma TG and HDL-C levels were compared in 179 hypertriglyceridemic HIV/HAART patients and 71 HIV-negative persons ( 31 normotriglyceridemic ( NL ) and 40 hypertriglyceridemic due to type IV hyperlipidemia ( HTG ) ) . P11597 mass and activity were compared in 19 NL and 87 HIV/HAART subjects . RESULTS : Among the three groups , a plot of HDL-C vs. TG gave similar slopes but significantly different y-intercepts ( 9.24±0.45 , 8.16±0.54 , 6.70±0.65 , sqrt(HDL-C) for NL , HIV and HTG respectively ; P < 0.001 ) ; this difference persisted after adjusting HDL-C for TG , age , BMI , gender , glucose , P01730 count , viral load and HAART strata ( 7.18±0.20 , 6.20±0.05 and 4.55±0.15 sqrt(HDL-C) for NL , HIV and HTG , respectively , P < 0.001 ) . P11597 activity was not different between NL and HIV , but P11597 mass was significantly higher in HIV ( 1.47±0.53 compared to 0.93±0.27μg/mL , P < 0.0001 ) , hence P11597 specific activity was lower in HIV ( 22.67±13.46 compared to 28.46±8.24nmol/μg/h , P=0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Dyslipidemic HIV/HAART patients have a distinctive HDL-C plasma concentration adjusted for TG . The weak inverse relationship between HDL-C and TG is not explained by altered total P11597 activity ; it could result from a non- P11597 -dependent mechanism or a decrease in P11597 function due to inhibitors of P11597 activity in HIV patients ' plasma .
