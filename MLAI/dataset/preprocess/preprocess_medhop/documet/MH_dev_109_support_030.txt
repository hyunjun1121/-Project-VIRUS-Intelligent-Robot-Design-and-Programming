Antenatal maternally-administered phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors normalize P29474 expression in the fetal lamb model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia . PURPOSE : Pulmonary hypertension ( pHTN ) , a main determinant of survival in congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( Q8NE62 ) , results from in utero vascular remodeling . Phosphodiesterase type 5 ( O76074 ) inhibitors have never been used antenatally to treat pHTN . The purpose of this study is to determine if antenatal O76074 inhibitors can prevent pHTN in the fetal lamb model of Q8NE62 . METHODS : Q8NE62 was created in pregnant ewes . Postoperatively , pregnant ewes received oral placebo or tadalafil , a O76074 inhibitor , until delivery . Near term gestation , lambs underwent resuscitations , and lung tissue was snap frozen for protein analysis . RESULTS : Mean cGMP levels were 0.53±0.11 in placebo-treated fetal lambs and 1.73±0.21 in tadalafil-treated fetal lambs ( p=0.002 ) . Normalized expression of P29474 was 82 % ±12 % in Normal-Placebo , 61 % ±5 % in Q8NE62 -Placebo , 116 % ±6 % in Normal- DB00820 , and 86 % ±8 % in Q8NE62 - DB00820 lambs . Normalized expression of β-sGC was 105 % ±15 % in Normal-Placebo , 82 % ±3 % in Q8NE62 -Placebo , 158 % ±16 % in Normal- DB00820 , and 86 % ±8 % in Q8NE62 - DB00820 lambs . P29474 and β-sGC were significantly decreased in Q8NE62 ( p=0.0007 and 0.01 for P29474 and β-sGC , respectively ) , and tadalafil significantly increased P29474 expression ( p=0.0002 ) . CONCLUSIONS : O76074 inhibitors can cross the placental barrier . β-sGC and P29474 are downregulated in fetal lambs with Q8NE62 . Antenatal O76074 inhibitors normalize P29474 and may prevent in utero vascular remodeling in Q8NE62 .
