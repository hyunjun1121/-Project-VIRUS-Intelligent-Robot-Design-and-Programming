Development of stable cell lines expressing different subtypes of GABAA receptors . The experiments reported here were motivated by our interest to express in stably-transfected cells large amounts of recombinant rat GABAA receptors . For this , we developed an original two step selection strategy , in which the first step consisted of transfecting P29320 293 cells with rat GABAA receptor alpha and beta subunits . G 418 resistant colonies isolated at this step were screened for [ 3H ] muscimol binding to select for those that coexpressed alpha- and beta-subunits . The best alpha and beta subunit expressing colony was then supertransfected with a plasmid coding for the gamma rat GABAA receptor subunit and a mutant P00374 gene . After a second round of selection , this time in presence of methotrexate , those colonies that coexpressed ternary alpha beta gamma GABAA receptor combinations were distinguished using [ 3H ] flumazenil as a probe . This strategy was applied to the isolation of 3 GABAA receptor clones , alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s , alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2s and alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2s , that expressed relatively high levels of these proteins . These 3 cell lines exhibited pharmacological and functional properties similar to cells transiently-transfected with equivalent subunit combinations . These cell lines therefore provide attractive models with which to evaluate the intrinsic activity and potency of compounds at recombinant GABAA receptor subtypes .
