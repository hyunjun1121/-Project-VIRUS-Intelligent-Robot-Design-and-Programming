P11362 - 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A heteroreceptor complexes and their enhancement of hippocampal plasticity . BACKGROUND : The hippocampus and its 5-hydroxytryptamine transmission plays an important role in depression related to its involvement in limbic circuit plasticity . METHODS : The analysis was made with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer , co-immunoprecipitation , in situ proximity ligation assay , binding assay , in cell western and the forced swim test . RESULTS : Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis , fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( P11362 ) -5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor complexes have been demonstrated and their specificity and agonist modulation characterized . Their presence based on co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay has also been indicated in hippocampal cultures and rat dorsal hippocampal formation showing a neuronal location . In vitro assays on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation have shown synergistic increases in signaling on coactivation with fibroblast growth factor 2 ( P09038 ) and a P08908 agonist , and dependent on the heteroreceptor interface . In vitro and in vivo studies also revealed a P08908 agonist induced phosphorylation of P11362 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in rat hippocampus without changing P09038 levels . Co-activation of the heteroreceptor also resulted in synergistic increases in extensions of PC12 cells and neurite densities and protrusions in primary hippocampal cultures dependent on the receptor interface . The combined acute and repeated intracerebroventricular treatment with P09038 and 8-OH-DPAT was found to produce evidence of highly significant antidepressant actions in the forced swim test . CONCLUSIONS : The findings indicate that neurotrophic and antidepressant effects of 5-HT in brain may , in part , be mediated by activation of the P08908 receptor protomer in the hippocampal P11362 - P08908 receptor complex enhancing the P11362 signaling .
