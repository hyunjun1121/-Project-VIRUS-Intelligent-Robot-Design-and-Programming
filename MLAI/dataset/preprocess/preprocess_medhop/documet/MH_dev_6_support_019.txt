Differential expression and function of phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) subtypes in human primary P01730 + T cells : predominant role of Q08499 . Type 4 phosphodiesterases ( DB05876 ) are critical regulators in TCR signaling by attenuating the negative constraint of DB02527 . In this study , we show that anti-CD3/ P10747 stimulation of human primary P01730 (+) T cells increases the expression of the DB05876 subtypes P27815 , Q07343 , and Q08499 in a specific and time-dependent manner . P27815 and Q08499 mRNAs as well as enzyme activities were up-regulated within 5 days , Q07343 showed a transient up-regulation with highest levels after 24 h . The induction was shown to be independent of different stimulation conditions and was similar in naive and memory T cell subpopulations . To elucidate the functional impact of individual DB05876 subtypes on T cell function , we used DB05876 subtype-specific short-interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) . Knockdown of either Q07343 or Q08499 inhibited P60568 release 24 h after stimulation ( time point of maximal P60568 concentrations ) to an extent similar to that observed with the panPDE4 inhibitor RP73401 ( piclamilast ) . Substantial amounts of P01579 or P05113 were measured only at later time points . siRNA targeting Q08499 showed a predominant inhibitory effect on these cytokines measured after 72 h . However , the inhibition of all cytokines was most effective when DB05876 siRNAs were applied in combination . Although the effect of DB05876 inhibition on T cell proliferation is small , the Q08499 -targeting siRNA alone was as effective as the panPDE4 inhibitor , whereas P27815 or Q07343 siRNAs had hardly an effect . In summary , individual DB05876 subtypes have overall nonredundant , but complementary , time-dependent roles in propagating various T cell functions and Q08499 is the form likely playing a predominant role .
