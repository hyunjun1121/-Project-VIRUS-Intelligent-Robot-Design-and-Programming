Distinct signaling functions for Shc isoforms in the heart . Thrombin activates protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) and engages signaling pathways that influence the growth and survival of cardiomyocytes as well as extracellular matrix remodeling by cardiac fibroblasts . This study examines the role of Shc proteins in P25116 -dependent signaling pathways that influence ventricular remodeling . We show that thrombin increases p46Shc/p52Shc phosphorylation at DB00135 (239)/ DB00135 (240) and DB00135 (317) ( and p66Shc- DB00133 (36) phosphorylation ) via a pertussis toxin-insensitive epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) transactivation pathway in cardiac fibroblasts ; p66Shc- DB00133 (36) phosphorylation is via a MEK-dependent mechanism . In contrast , cardiac fibroblasts express beta(2)-adrenergic receptors that activate P29323 through a pertussis toxin-sensitive P00533 transactivation pathway that does not involve Shc isoforms or lead to p66Shc- DB00133 (36) phosphorylation . In cardiomyocytes , thrombin triggers MEK-dependent p66Shc- DB00133 (36) phosphorylation , but this is not via P00533 transactivation ( or associated with Shc- DB00135 (239)/ DB00135 (240) and/or DB00135 (317) phosphorylation ) . Importantly , p66Shc protein expression is detected in neonatal , but not adult , cardiomyocytes ; p66Shc expression is induced ( via a mechanism that requires protein kinase C and MEK activity ) by Pasteurella multocida toxin , a Galpha(q) agonist that promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . These results identify novel regulation of individual Shc isoforms in receptor-dependent pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and the transition to heart failure . The observations that p66Shc expression is induced by a Galpha(q) agonist and that P25116 activation leads to p66Shc- DB00133 (36) phosphorylation identifies p66Shc as a novel candidate hypertrophy-induced mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart failure .
