Serotonin increases P27361 /2 phosphorylation in astrocytes by stimulation of P41595 and P28335 receptors . We have previously shown that fluoxetine causes P29323 (1/2) phosphorylation in cultured mouse astrocytes mediated exclusively by stimulation of 5-HT(2B) receptors ( Li et al. , 2008b ) . This raises the question whether this is also the case for serotonin ( 5-HT ) itself . In the present study serotonin was found to induce P29323 (1/2) phosphorylation by stimulation of 5-HT(2B) receptors with high affinity ( EC(50) : 20-30 pM ) , and by stimulation of 5-HT(2C) receptor with low affinity ( EC(50) : 1 microM or higher ) . P29323 (1/2) phosphorylation induced by stimulation of either 5-HT(2B) or 5-HT(2C) receptors was mediated by epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptor transactivation ( Peng et al. , this issue ) , shown by the inhibitory effect of AG1478 , an inhibitor of the P01133 receptor tyrosine kinase , and DB02255 , an inhibitor of Zn-dependent metalloproteinases , and thus of 5-HT(2B) receptor-mediated P01133 receptor agonist release . It is discussed that the high potency of the 5-HT(2B)-mediated effect is consistent with literature data for binding affinity of serotonin to cloned human 5-HT(2B) receptors and with observations of low extracellular concentrations of serotonin in brain , which would allow a demonstrated moderate and modality-dependent increase in specific brain areas to activate 5-HT(2B) receptors . In contrast the relevance of the observed 5-HT(2C) receptors on astrocytes is questioned .
