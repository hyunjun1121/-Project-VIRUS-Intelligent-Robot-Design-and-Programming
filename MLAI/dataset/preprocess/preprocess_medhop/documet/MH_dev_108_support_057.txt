P01375 alpha antagonists in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis . INTRODUCTION : The introduction of therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists ( aTNF ) was a cornerstone of treatment modalities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . After > 10 years of using aTNF , the introduction of aTNF therapy was a major step forward in the medical management of patients with spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) , but there are still a number of scientific questions that have not been resolved . AREAS COVERED : This review includes both subtypes of axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA ) , non-radiographic axial SpA ( nr-axSpA ) , and AS . It covers all five aTNF adalimumab , certolizumab , etanercept , DB06674 , and infliximab , which are approved for patients with active AS . EXPERT OPINION : aTNF are efficacious and effective in reducing signs and symptoms of patients with axSpA . While aTNF reduce spinal inflammation , the effects on new bone formation are less clear . There may be a deceleration of radiographic progression in 4 years . The development of fatty lesions in vertebral edges seems to be relevant for that - especially when inflammation also persists . Reduction of aTNF doses seems to be possible in selected patients over time . In case of failure , switching to another aTNF works in the majority of cases . Long-term data suggest a favorable safety profile of aTNF .
