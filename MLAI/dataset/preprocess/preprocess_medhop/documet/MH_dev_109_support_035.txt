A bispecific antifibrin-antiplatelet urokinase conjugate ( BAAUC ) induces enhanced clot lysis and inhibits platelet aggregation . Thrombolysis is well established in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction . However , clinical application of thrombolytic agents has limitations with respect to efficacy and specificity . To achieve highly effective and at the same time clot-selective plasminogen activation urokinase was coupled to a bispecific antibody consisting of the monovalent Fab ' from the antifibrin monoclonal antibody 59D8 and the monovalent Fab ' from the anti-glycoprotein P08514 /IIIa monoclonal antibody DB00054 . The bispecific antifibrin-antiplatelet urokinase conjugate ( BAAUC ) was synthesized and characterized . Assays with either immobilized platelets , P08514 /IIIa or fibrin showed an increase in plasminogen activation compared to uncoupled urokinase by 10-fold , 58-fold and 13-fold , respectivley ( p < 0.0001 each ) . In vitro clot lysis was performed on platelet-rich and fibrin-rich clots and revealed an up to 5-fold higher potency of BAAUC compared to uncoupled urokinase ( p < 0.0001 ) . In vitro platelet aggregation was effectively inhibited by the hybrid molecule , whereas urokinase had no effect . BAAUC and two monospecific urokinase-conjugates , UK-59D8-IgG and UK-7E3-(Fab')2 were compared with each other with regard to similar tests . In vitro clot assays with platelet-rich and platelet-poor clots were performed . BAAUC achieved a significantly higher plasminogen activation compared to each of the monospecific conjugates ( p < 0.05 , respectively ) . We conclude that BAAUC , a bispecific plasminogen activator with antifibrin and antiplatelet properties has the potency to lyse both fibrin-rich and platelet-rich thrombi with high efficacy and to effectively inhibit platelet aggregation .
