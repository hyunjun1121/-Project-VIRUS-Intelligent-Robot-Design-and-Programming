[ Major therapeutic advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma ] . The treatment of metastatic melanoma is presently in complete revolution . Two molecules have recently been authorized for this indication . These treatments have a very different mechanism of action compared to previous chemotherapies . DB08881 is a targeted therapy , which blocks P15056 selectively . This molecule induces objective responses in more than 50 % of the patients with V600E mutated melanoma and a benefit in terms of overall survival . However , many patients relapse after about 6 to 8 months of treatment . Many mechanisms are evoked to explain these secondary resistances to therapy . DB06186 is an immunotherapy that blocks P16410 , a physiological brake of lymphocyte activation . With ipilimumab , the objective responses are less frequent than with vemurafenib but are more prolonged over time . Two phases III have demonstrated that ipilimumab treatment is effective on the overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma . New combination therapies and additional targeted and immunotherapy agents are exciting perspectives that make us more optimistic for the future of metastatic melanoma treatment .
