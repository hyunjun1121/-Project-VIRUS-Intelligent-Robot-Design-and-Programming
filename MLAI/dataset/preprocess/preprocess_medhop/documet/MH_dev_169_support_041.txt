Cytokine signaling in the human brain capillary endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 . Brain microvascular endothelial cells are part of the blood-brain barrier and participate actively in immunological processes including cytokine-mediated inflammatory reactions . Using the human brain capillary endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 , activation of JAK/ P35610 signaling pathways were studied in response to stimulation by cytokines . The phenotype of hCMEC/D3 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of cell adhesion factors ( cluster of differentiation molecules CD31 and P28906 ) and the P04275 endothelial marker was detected by immunofluorescence . Strong P42224 , P42226 and P40763 activation was observed in response to interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) , interleukin 4 ( P05112 ) and interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) , respectively . Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated P35610 proteins was visualized by confocal microscopy . Treatment of hCMEC/D3 cells with P01579 resulted in interferon-induced upregulation of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I within 48h . Interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) did not activate P42224 or P40763 nor did it induce MHC class I upregulation . Therefore , hCMEC/D3 cells were judged to be non-responsive to IFN-alpha . We also observed that hCMEC/D3 cells exhibit functional expression of alternative cytokine signal transduction pathways ( i.e. P01375 mediated activation of NF-kappaB ) . Together these results indicate that human blood-brain barrier hCMEC/D3 cells are responsive towards stimulation with various cytokines . We conclude that this unique cell line can be used to explore in vitro human blood-brain barrier functionality under proinflammatory conditions .
