P12318 polymorphism is correlated with clinical outcome after immunotherapy of neuroblastoma with anti-GD2 antibody and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor . PURPOSE : Anti-GD2 murine IgG3 antibody 3F8 kills neuroblastoma cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) enhances phagocyte-mediated ADCC . The differential affinity of the human FCGR polymorphic alleles for 3F8 may influence the effectiveness of antibody immunotherapy . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The entire cohort of high risk neuroblastoma patients ( N = 136 ) treated on protocol using 3F8 and GM- P04141 were the subjects of this analysis . Tumor response was measured by standard clinical tools plus sensitive molecular monitoring using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . Polymorphic alleles of P12318 and P08637 were determined by PCR plus direct sequencing using genomic DNA samples obtained from marrow or blood of patients . RESULTS : P12318 ( R/R ) genotype correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort ( P = .049 ) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse ( P = .023 ) . P12318 ( R/R ) also correlated with marrow remission 2.5 months after treatment initiation : by histology ( P = .021 and P = .036 , for the entire cohort and the subset , respectively ) and by qRT-PCR ( P = .052 and P = .033 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : The favorable outcome associated with P12318 ( R/R ) genotype is consistent with the proposed role of P12318 and phagocyte-mediated ADCC in 3F8 plus GM- P04141 immunotherapy .
