Q01094 :DP-1 induces p53 and overrides survival factors to trigger apoptosis . The E2F DNA binding activity consists of a heterodimer between E2F and DP family proteins , and these interactions are required for association of E2F proteins with P06400 and the P06400 -related proteins P28749 and Q08999 , which modulate E2F transcriptional activities . Q01094 expression is sufficient to release fibroblasts from G0 and induce entry into S phase , yet it also initiates apoptosis . To investigate the mechanisms of E2F-induced apoptosis , we utilized interleukin-3 ( P08700 ) -dependent 32D.3 myeloid cells , a model of hematopoietic progenitor programmed cell death . In the absence of P08700 , Q01094 alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis , and p53 levels were diminished . DP-1 alone was not sufficient to induce cell cycle progression or alter rates of death following P08700 withdrawal . However , overexpression of both Q01094 and DP-1 led to the rapid death of cells even in the presence of survival factors . In the presence of P08700 , levels of endogenous wild-type p53 increased in response to Q01094 , and coexpression of DP-1 further augmented p53 levels . These results provide evidence that E2F is a functional link between the tumor suppressors p53 and P06400 . However , induction of p53 alone was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis , suggesting that the ability of E2F to override survival factors involves additional effectors .
