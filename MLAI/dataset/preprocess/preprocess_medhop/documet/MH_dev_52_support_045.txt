DB00163 prevents diabetes-induced abnormal retinal blood flow via the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C pathway . We have characterized effects of d- DB00163 ( vitamin E ) on activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) levels in retinal tissues of diabetic rats and correlated its effects to diabetes-induced changes in retinal hemodynamics . Membrane PKC specific activities were increased by 71 % in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats compared with controls ( P < 0.05 ) . Western blot analysis showed that membrane P05771 II was increased by 133 +/- 5 % ( P < 0.05 ) . Injection of d- DB00163 ( 40 mg/kg ip ) every other day prevented the increases in membrane PKC specific activity and P05771 II protein by immunoblots . Diabetes-induced increases in DAG levels were also normalized by d- DB00163 treatment of 2 wk duration . Physiologically , angiographic abnormalities of retinal hemodynamics based on computerized video-based fluorescein angiography and associated with increases of DAG and membranous PKC levels were also prevented by d- DB00163 treatment in diabetic rats . The effect of d- DB00163 on retinal vascular cells was also studied . Exposure of retinal endothelial cells to 22 mM glucose for 3 days increased total DAG and [3H]palmitate-labeled DAG levels by 35 +/- 8 and 50 +/- 8 % ( P < 0.05 ) , respectively , compared with exposure to 5.5 mM glucose . The presence of d- DB00163 ( 50 micrograms/ml ) prevented the increases in total DAG and [3H]palmitate-labeled DAG levels in cells exposed to 22 mM glucose . These findings suggested that treatment with d- DB00163 can prevent diabetes-induced abnormalities in rat retinal blood flow. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
