MicroRNA-137/181c regulates serine palmitoyltransferase and in turn amyloid β , novel targets in sporadic Alzheimer 's disease . The contribution of mutations in amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) and presenilin ( PSEN ) to familial Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is well established . However , little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to amyloid β ( Aβ ) generation in sporadic AD . Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD , and are a suggested risk factor . DB00133 palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis . However , the regulation of P21549 is not yet understood . Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated . Therefore , we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of P21549 and amyloid β ( Aβ ) generation . We show that P21549 is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains . This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD . We identified that the loss of miR-137 , -181c , -9 , and 29a/b-1 increases P21549 and in turn Aβ levels , and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age , high-saturated-fat diet , and gender . Finally , these results suggest P21549 and the respective miRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets for sporadic AD .
