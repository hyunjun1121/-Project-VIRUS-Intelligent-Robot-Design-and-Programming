Is phentermine an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase ? A critical appraisal . DB00191 produces a spectrum of concentration-dependent biochemical effects . It interacts with NE transporters at 0.1 microM , DA transporters at about 1 microM , 5-HT transporters at 15 microM and P21397 at about 100 microM . When administered at typical anorectic doses , phentermine primarily interacts with DA and NE transporters and does not produce biochemical or neurochemical effects which would occur if it were inhibiting P21397 . Some other explanation other than MAO inhibition must be sought to explain how oral phentermine increases platelet 5-HT , since platelet P27338 does not metabolize platelet 5-HT , and since amphetamine-type drugs are even weaker inhibitors of P27338 than P21397 . Clinical studies in humans have shown that amphetamine , which is a more potent inhibitor of P21397 than phentermine , does not inhibit P21397 at therapeutic doses . Neither phentermine alone , fluoxetine alone or their combined use have been associated with cardiac valvulopathy , and clinical experience has shown their combined use to be free of significant adverse effects . Viewed collectively , there appears to be no data to support the hypothesis that phentermine inhibits MAO at typical therapeutic doses .
