Phase I trial of oral P42345 inhibitor everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in pre-treated patients with P04626 -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . To determine the feasible dose and schedule for everolimus , an oral P42345 inhibitor , combined with vinorelbine and trastuzumab for patients with P04626 -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab . In this phase Ib multicenter , Bayesian dose-escalation study , 50 patients received everolimus 5 mg/day , 20 mg/week , or 30 mg/week plus vinorelbine ( 25 mg/mÂ² on day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks ) and trastuzumab ( 2 mg/kg weekly ) . Endpoints included end-of-cycle-1 dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) rate ( primary endpoint ) , safety , relative dose intensity , overall response rate ( ORR ) , and pharmacokinetics . Grade 3/4 neutropenia was the most common end-of-cycle-1 DLT and occurred in 10 of 30 and 4 of 14 patients in the 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week cohorts , respectively . Other end-of-cycle-1 DLTs included single cases of febrile neutropenia , grade 3 stomatitis with concomitant fatigue , grade 2 stomatitis , grade 3 anorexia , and grade 2 acneiform dermatitis , all in the 5-mg/day cohort . Based on the recorded DLTs and global safety , everolimus 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week were chosen as the optimal dose levels for the daily and weekly arms . Forty-seven patients were evaluable for efficacy . ORR was 19.1 % , with a disease control rate of 83.0 % and median progression-free survival of 30.7 weeks . No drug interaction was observed between everolimus and vinorelbine . DB01590 combined with weekly vinorelbine and trastuzumab generally was well tolerated and had encouraging antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with P04626 -overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that progressed on trastuzumab ( NCT00426530 ) .
