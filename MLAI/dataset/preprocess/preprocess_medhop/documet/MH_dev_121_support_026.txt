Protective effects of heparin on endothelial cells in sepsis . This study aims to observe the protective effects of heparin on endothelial cells in sepsis and explore the involved signal pathway regulated by heparin . Methods Human vascular endothelial cells were treated by TNFα in vitro to simulate the inflammatory environment when sepsis occurred . They were intervened by heparin and the expression levels of soluble thrombomodulin ( sTM ) and serum activated protein C ( P25054 ) were detected by ELISA , the regulatory mechanism of heparin improving vascular endothelial cells injury induced by TNFα was detected by Western Blotting method , the methylation of histone in the gene promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( P13500 ) were detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation method . Results DB01109 could inhibit the secretion of sTM and P25054 protein and the expression of P13500 gene which involved in NF-κB signal pathway . Conclusions DB01109 could protect vascular endothelial cells from injury induced by TNFα and sepsis , the mechanisms were related with the effects of heparin on the histone methylation of promoter region and the regulation of heparin on the MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways . These results provide a theoretical basis for the application of heparin in the prevention and treatment of vascular disease related with sepsis .
