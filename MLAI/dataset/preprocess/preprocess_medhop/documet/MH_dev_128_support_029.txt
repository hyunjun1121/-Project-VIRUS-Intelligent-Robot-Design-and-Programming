All-trans retinoic acid downregulates P00352 -mediated stemness and inhibits tumour formation in ovarian cancer cells . Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( P00352 ) is a cancer stem-like cell ( CSC ) marker in human cancers ; however , the specific P00352 -regulated function and its underlying signalling pathways have not been fully demonstrated . Here , we investigated the P00352 -regulated function and its underlying signalling and tested whether all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) can suppress P00352 -regulated tumour behaviour in ovarian cancer cells . By modulating P00352 expression using flow cytometry enrichment and exogenous overexpression or knockdown , we showed that the P00352 activity is positively correlated with stemness in ovarian cancer cells according to measures such as sphere formation and CSC marker expression as well as tumourigenesis in a mouse xenograft model . The findings indicate that the P00352 directly regulates the functions of ovarian cancer cells . We also showed that P00352 can regulate the expression of FoxM1 and P46531 , which are involved in the downstream signalling of P00352 -mediated biofunctions . Inhibition of FoxM1 by Thiostrepton and of Notch1 by DAPT downregulated the sphere formation ability of cells . DB00755 reduced P00352 expression , suppressed tumour formation and inhibited sphere formation , cell migration and invasion in P00352 -abundant ovarian cancer cells . We conclude that DB00755 downregulates P00352 /FoxM1/Notch1 signalling and suppresses tumour formation in ovarian cancer cells .
