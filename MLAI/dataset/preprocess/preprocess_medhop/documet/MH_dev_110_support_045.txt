Inhibition of THC-induced effects on the central nervous system and heart rate by a novel P21554 receptor antagonist AVE1625 . P21554 antagonists such as AVE1625 are potentially useful in the treatment of obesity , smoking cessation and cognitive impairment . Proof of pharmacological action of AVE1625 in the brain can be given by antagonising the effects of DB00470 ( THC ) , a P21554 /CB2 agonist . Inhibition of THC-induced effects by AVE1625 was observed on Visual Analogue Scales ' alertness ' , ' feeling high ' , ' external perception ' , ' body sway ' and ' heart rate ' . Even the lowest dose of AVE1625 20 mg inhibited most of THC-induced effects . AVE1625 did not have any effect on psychological and behavioural parameters or heart rate by itself . After THC and AVE1625 administration , changes on electroencephalography were observed . This study shows a useful method for studying the effects of P21554 antagonists . AVE1625 penetrates the brain and antagonises THC-induced effects with doses at or above 20 mg .
