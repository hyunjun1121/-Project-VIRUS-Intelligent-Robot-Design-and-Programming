P30559 genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans . DB00107 , a peptide that functions as both a hormone and neurotransmitter , has broad influences on social and emotional processing throughout the body and the brain . In this study , we tested how a polymorphism ( rs53576 ) of the oxytocin receptor relates to two key social processes related to oxytocin : empathy and stress reactivity . Compared with individuals homozygous for the G allele of rs53576 ( GG ) , individuals with one or two copies of the A allele ( AG/AA ) exhibited lower behavioral and dispositional empathy , as measured by the " Reading the Mind in the Eyes " Test and an other-oriented empathy scale . Furthermore , AA/AG individuals displayed higher physiological and dispositional stress reactivity than GG individuals , as determined by heart rate response during a startle anticipation task and an affective reactivity scale . Our results provide evidence of how a naturally occurring genetic variation of the oxytocin receptor relates to both empathy and stress profiles .
