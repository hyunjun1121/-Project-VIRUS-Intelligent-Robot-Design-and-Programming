Hypophysitis caused by ipilimumab in cancer patients : hormone replacement or immunosuppressive therapy . DB06186 is besides the P15056 inhibitor vemurafenib the first officially approved medical treatment for metastatic melanoma , which results in improved survival . DB06186 leads to a release of a P16410 -mediated inhibition of T-cell immunoreactions . Therefore , patients may also suffer from immune-related adverse events affecting different organs , which are typically treated by high-dose corticosteroids . DB06186 -induced hypophysitis ( iH ) has been reported in up to 17 % of melanoma patients in clinical trials.Here we present 5 patients with metastatic melanoma and 2 patients with prostate cancer who developed hypophysitis after ipilimumab therapy . Patients were treated by high-dose corticosteroid therapy resulting in the resolution of local inflammation but not of pituitary deficiencies . Partial or complete hypopituitarism remained in all patients . Pharmacotherapy with high-dose corticosteroids caused complications in 5 patients , necessitating hospitalization in 4 . 2 of the 3 patients with progressive disease died , while 3 patients had stable disease and 1 patient showed tumor regression after discontinuation of ipilimumab.In summary , with regard to safety and simplicity of hormonal substitution therapy we have to scrutinize high-dose corticosteroid therapy , though it only improves inflammation but not neuro-endocrine function and may cause further morbidity . Regression of the tumor depends on the ipilimumab-mediated immune events , in which high-dose and long-term corticosteroid therapy for iH appears to be counter-intuitive . Herein , we discuss screening and the diagnostic as well as therapeutic management of iH in metastatic cancer patients from an endocrinologic perspective .
