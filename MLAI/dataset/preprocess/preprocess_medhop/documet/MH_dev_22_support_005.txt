Targeting of preexisting and induced breast cancer stem cells with trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) . The antibody trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) has substantially improved overall survival for patients with aggressive P04626 -positive breast cancer . However , about 70 % of all treated patients will experience relapse or disease progression . This may be related to an insufficient targeting of the P16070 (high) P25063 (low) breast cancer stem cell subset , which is not only highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also a poor target for trastuzumab due to low P04626 surface expression . Hence , we explored whether the new antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 , which consists of the potent chemotherapeutic DM1 coupled to trastuzumab , could improve the targeting of these tumor-initiating or metastasis-initiating cells . To this aim , primary P04626 -overexpressing tumor cells as well as P04626 -positive and P04626 -negative breast cancer cell lines were treated with DB05773 , and effects on survival , colony formation , gene and protein expression as well as antibody internalization were assessed . This revealed that P16070 (high) P25063 (low) P04626 (low) stem cell-like breast cancer cells show high endocytic activity and are thus particularly sensitive towards the antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 . Consequently , preexisting P16070 (high) P25063 (low) cancer stem cells were depleted by concentrations of DB05773 that did not affect the bulk of the tumor cells . Likewise , colony formation was efficiently suppressed . Moreover , when tumor cells were cocultured with natural killer cells , antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was enhanced , and EMT-mediated induction of stem cell-like properties was prevented in differentiated tumor cells . Thus our study reveals an unanticipated targeting of stem cell-like breast cancer cells by DB05773 that may contribute to the clinical efficacy of this recently approved antibody-drug conjugate .
