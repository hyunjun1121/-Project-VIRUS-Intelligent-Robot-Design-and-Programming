Inhibition of Q16552 as a pharmacological approach for Q9UKU7 . Several experimental approaches have been utilized , in order to critically examine the roles of Q16552 family members in intestinal inflammation . These approaches have included : ( 1 ) the use of Q16552 and Q96PD4 -deficient mice , ( 2 ) specific antibodies directed against Q16552 , ( 3 ) an Q16552 vaccine , ( 4 ) methods to block the Q16552 receptor and ( 5 ) small-molecule inhibitors of Q16552 . Previous studies found somewhat conflicting results in preclinical models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( Q9UKU7 ) , using specific strains of Q16552 -deficient mice . This paper will review the preclinical results using various pharmacological approaches [ specific Q16552 antibodies , an Q16552 receptor fusion protein , IL-12/IL-23 p40 subunit and Q16552 vaccine approaches , as well as a small molecule inhibitor ( Vidofludimus ) ] to inhibit Q16552 in animal models of Q9UKU7 . Recent clinical results in patients with Q9UKU7 will also be discussed for DB09029 ( an Q16552 antibody ) , Brodalumab ( an Q16552 receptor antibody ) and two small-molecule drugs ( Vidofludimus and DB08895 ) , which inhibit Q16552 as part of their overall pharmacological profiles . This review paper will also discuss some pharmacological lessons learned from the preclinical and clinical studies with anti- Q16552 drugs , as related to drug pharmacodynamics , Q16552 receptor subtypes and other pertinent factors . Finally , future pharmacological approaches of interest will be discussed , such as : ( 1 ) Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t ( Rorγt ) antagonists , ( 2 ) P10276 ( RARα ) antagonists , ( 3 ) Pim-1 kinase inhibitors and ( 4 ) Dual small-molecule inhibitors of NF-κB and P40763 , like synthetic triterpenoids .
