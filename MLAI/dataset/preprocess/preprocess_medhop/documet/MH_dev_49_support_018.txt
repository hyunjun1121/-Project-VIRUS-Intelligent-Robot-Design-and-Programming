Repression of P10415 by the tumor suppressor activity of the lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits transformed phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells . The gene encoding lysyl oxidase ( P28300 ) was identified as the ras recision gene ( rrg ) , with the ability to revert Ras-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts . Mutations in DB01367 genes have been found in approximately 25 % of lung cancers and in 85 % of pancreatic cancers . In microarray analysis , these cancers were found to display reduced P28300 gene expression . Thus , the ability of the P28300 gene to repress the transformed phenotype of these cancer cells was tested . P28300 is synthesized as a 50-kDa secreted precursor Pro- P28300 that is processed to the 32-kDa active enzyme ( P28300 ) and to an 18-kDa propeptide ( P28300 -PP ) . Recently , we mapped the rrg activity of Pro- P28300 to the P28300 -PP in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells . Ectopic Pro- P28300 and P28300 -PP expression in H1299 lung cancer cells inhibited growth in soft agar and invasive colony formation in Matrigel and reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and Akt , with P28300 -PP showing substantially higher activity . Similarly , P28300 -PP expression in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells effectively reduced P29323 and Akt activity and inhibited growth in soft agar and ability of these cells to migrate . Nuclear Factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and its target gene P10415 , which are overexpressed in 70 % to 75 % of pancreatic cancers , have recently been implicated in invasive phenotype . P28300 -PP substantially reduced NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 levels . Reintroduction of Bcl-2 into PANC-1 or H1299 cells expressing P28300 -PP restored the transformed phenotype , suggesting that Bcl-2 is an essential target . Thus , P28300 -PP potently inhibits invasive phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells , suggesting potential therapeutic applications in treatment of these cancers .
