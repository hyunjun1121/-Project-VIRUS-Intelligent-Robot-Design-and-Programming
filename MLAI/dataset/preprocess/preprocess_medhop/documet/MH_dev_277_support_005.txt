Proteomic identification of radiation response markers in mouse intestine and brain . Increasing efforts are being made to develop more sensitive and faster molecular methodologies at the genomic and proteomic levels for the identification of protein markers after exposure to ionizing radiation ( IR ) . However , few specific protein markers , especially organ-specific markers , have been identified . In this study , we analyzed altered protein expressions in various tissues , namely , brain , lung , spleen , and intestine , from 1 Gy-irradiated mice by employing 2-DE analysis . MALDI-TOF MS and peptide mapping identified 25 proteins that showed greater than twofold expressional changes . In order to confirm significant differences between control and IR-treated samples , ten identified proteins with available commercial antibodies were selected for immunoblotting . Of these , only five showed protein expression patterns that were similar to 2-DE data . These were heat shock protein 5 ( HSP 5 ) , P08238 kDa Î² , HSP 1 , transaldolase 1 ( Q96RJ0 ) , and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 ( P00558 ) . In particular , P00558 was specifically upregulated in mouse intestine , and Q96RJ0 was specifically downregulated in brain by irradiation . Q96RJ0 expression was unaltered in other tissues . Based on these data , we suggest that Q96RJ0 and P00558 can be considered as candidate tissue-specific protein markers of IR exposure .
