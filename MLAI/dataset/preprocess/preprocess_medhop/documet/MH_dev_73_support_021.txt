Arsenic decreases antinociceptive activity of paracetamol : possible involvement of serotonergic and endocannabinoid receptors . We assessed whether repeated arsenic exposure can decrease paracetamol-mediated antinociception by modulating serotonergic and endocannabinoid pathways . Rats were preexposed to elemental arsenic ( 4ppm ) as sodium arsenite through drinking water for 28 days . Next day paracetamol 's ( 400mg/kg , oral ) antinociceptive activity was assessed through formalin-induced nociception . Serotonin content and gene expression of P08908 , 5- Q13049 and P21554 receptors were evaluated in brainstem and frontal cortex . Arsenic decreased paracetamol-mediated analgesia . DB00316 , but not arsenic , increased serotonin content in these regions . Arsenic attenuated paracetamol-mediated increase in serotonin level . DB00316 did not alter P08908 expression , but caused down-regulation of 5- Q13049 and up-regulation of P21554 receptors . Arsenic down-regulated these receptors . However , paracetamol-mediated down-regulation of 5- Q13049 was more pronounced . Arsenic did not modify paracetamol 's effect on P08908 expression , but reduced paracetamol-mediated down-regulation of 5- Q13049 and reversed up-regulation of P21554 receptors . Results suggest arsenic reduced paracetamol-induced analgesia possibly by interfering with pronociceptive 5- Q13049 and antinociceptive P21554 receptors .
