Update on the biology and therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors . BACKGROUND : Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) , the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract , are an example of a disease with an effective , molecularly targeted therapy . METHODS : Published articles and author experience were used to comprehensively define the clinical features , biology , and state-of-the-art therapy of GISTs . RESULTS : GISTs are thought to originate from the neoplastic transformation of the interstitial cells of Cajal , the intestinal pacemaker cells . GISTs commonly have mutations in the kit gene , resulting in a gain-of-function mutation and ligand-independent constitutive activation of the P10721 receptor tyrosine kinase . Successful tyrosine kinase inhibitors target the aberrant pathways that are critical for tumor cell viability . The development of imatinib mesylate ( formerly DB00619 ) in the treatment of metastatic GISTs represents a therapeutic breakthrough . CONCLUSIONS : Progress in the clinical diagnosis has led to an increased recognition of this disease as a distinct clinical entity . Treatment of metastatic GIST with imatinib has led to unprecedented improvements in progression-free and overall survival . The use of imatinib in the preoperative and postoperative treatment of GISTs is an area of intense investigation .
