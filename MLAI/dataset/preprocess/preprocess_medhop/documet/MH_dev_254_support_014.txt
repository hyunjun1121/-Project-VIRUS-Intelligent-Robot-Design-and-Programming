DB09079 , a triple angiokinase inhibitor , enhances cytotoxic therapy response in pancreatic cancer . Angiogenesis remains a sensible target for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) therapy . P15692 , PDGF , FGF and their receptors are expressed at high levels and correlate with poor prognosis in human PDAC . DB09079 is a triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets P17948 /2/3 , P11362 /2/3 and PDGFRα/β signaling . We investigated the antitumor activity of nintedanib alone or in combination with the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine in experimental PDAC . DB09079 inhibited proliferation of cells from multiple lineages found in PDAC , with gemcitabine enhancing inhibitory effects . DB09079 blocked PI3K/MAPK activity and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo . In a heterotopic model , net local tumor growth compared to controls ( 100 % ) was 60.8 ± 10.5 % in the gemcitabine group , -2.1 ± 9.9 % after nintedanib therapy and -12.4 ± 16 % after gemcitabine plus nintedanib therapy . Effects of therapy on intratumoral proliferation , microvessel density and apoptosis corresponded with tumor growth inhibition data . In a PDAC survival model , median animal survival after gemcitabine , nintedanib and gemcitabine plus nintedanib was 25 , 31 and 38 days , respectively , compared to 16 days in controls . The strong antitumor activity of nintedanib in experimental PDAC supports the potential of nintedanib-controlled mechanisms as targets for improved clinical PDAC therapy .
