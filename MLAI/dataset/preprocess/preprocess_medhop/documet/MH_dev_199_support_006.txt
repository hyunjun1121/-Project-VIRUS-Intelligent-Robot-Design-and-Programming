Combined effects of C225 and 125-iodine seed radiation on colorectal cancer cells . BACKGROUND : To characterize the effect of combined treatment of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) monoclonal antibody C225 and 125-iodine ( 125I ) seed radiation in human colorectal cancer . METHODS : We treated LS180 cells with 125I continuous low dose rate radiation in the presence and absence of 100 nM C225 . The clonogenic capacity , cellular proliferation , cell cycle distribution , apoptosis , and molecular pathways of the cells following the treatments were analyzed in vitro . RESULTS : The sensitizer enhancement ratio of C225 was approximately 1.4 . Treatment with C225 and radiation alone produced significant inhibition of cell growth , but combination therapy produced greater inhibition than either treatment administered alone . C225 increased the radiation-induced apoptosis and the fraction of Î³- P16104 foci positive cells at 48 h after treatment . The Akt phosphorylation level was lower in the cells receiving the combination treatment than in the cells treated with radiation or C225 alone . CONCLUSIONS : These findings indicate that C225 sensitizes LS180 cells to 125I seed radiation . Growth inhibition is mediated by inducing apoptosis and not cell cycle arrest . Additionally , we confirmed that C225 impairs DNA repair by reducing the cellular level of the P78527 and P12956 proteins . Furthermore , the inhibition of Akt signaling activation may be responsible for the C225-mediated radiosensitization .
