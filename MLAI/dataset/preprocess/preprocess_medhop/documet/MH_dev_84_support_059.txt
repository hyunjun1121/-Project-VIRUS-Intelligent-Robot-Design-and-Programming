Silencing urokinase in the ventral tegmental area in vivo induces changes in cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion . DB00133 proteases in the nervous system have functional roles in neural plasticity . Among them , urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) exerts a variety of functions during development , and is involved in learning and memory . Furthermore , psychostimulants strongly induce uPA expression in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway . In this study , doxycycline-regulatable lentiviruses expressing either uPA , a dominant-negative form of uPA , or non-regulatable lentiviruses expressing small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) targeted against uPA have been prepared and injected into the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) of rat brains . Over-expression of uPA in the VTA induces doxycycline-dependent expression of its receptor , Q03405 , but not its inhibitor , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) . Q03405 expression in the VTA is repressed upon silencing of uPA with lentiviruses expressing siRNAs . In addition , over-expression of uPA in the VTA promotes a 15-fold increase in locomotion activity upon cocaine delivery . Animals expressing the dominant-negative form of uPA did not display such hyperlocomotor activity . These cocaine-induced behavioural changes , associated with uPA expression , could be suppressed in the presence of doxycycline or uPA-specific siRNAs expressing lentiviruses . These data strongly support the major role of urokinase in cocaine-mediated plasticity changes .
