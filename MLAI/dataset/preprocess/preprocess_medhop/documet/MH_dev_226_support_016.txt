Q8N0V5 V ( Mgat5 ) -mediated N-glycosylation negatively regulates Th1 cytokine production by T cells . The differentiation of naive P01730 (+) T cells into either proinflammatory Th1 or proallergic Th2 cells strongly influences autoimmunity , allergy , and tumor immune surveillance . We previously demonstrated that beta1,6GlcNAc-branched complex-type ( Q8N0V5 V ( Mgat5 ) ) N-glycans on TCR are bound to galectins , an interaction that reduces TCR signaling by opposing agonist-induced TCR clustering at the immune synapse . Mgat5(-/-) mice display late-onset spontaneous autoimmune disease and enhanced resistance to tumor progression and metastasis . In this study we examined the role of beta1,6GlcNAc N-glycan expression in Th1/Th2 cytokine production and differentiation . beta1,6GlcNAc N-glycan expression is enhanced by TCR stimulation independent of cell division and declines at the end of the stimulation cycle . DB00075 -activated splenocytes and naive T cells from Mgat5(-/-) mice produce more P01579 and less P05112 compared with wild-type cells , the latter resulting in the loss of P05112 -dependent down-regulation of IL-4Ralpha . DB02034 , an inhibitor of Q16706 , blocked beta1,6GlcNAc N-glycan expression and caused a similar increase in P01579 production by T cells from humans and mice , but no additional enhancement in Mgat5(-/-) T cells . Mgat5 deficiency did not alter P01579 / P05112 production by polarized Th1 cells , but caused an approximately 10-fold increase in P01579 production by polarized Th2 cells . These data indicate that negative regulation of TCR signaling by beta1,6GlcNAc N-glycans promotes development of Th2 over Th1 responses , enhances polarization of Th2 cells , and suggests a mechanism for the increased autoimmune disease susceptibility observed in Mgat5(-/-) mice .
