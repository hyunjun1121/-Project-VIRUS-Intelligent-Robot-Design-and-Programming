Inhibition of canine exocrine pancreatic secretion by peptide YY is mediated by P10082 -preferring P28062 receptors . It is still unclear , which receptor subtype , Q03519 and/or P28062 , mediates the inhibitory action of P10082 on exocrine pancreatic secretion . The present study was undertaken to characterize functionally the Y receptor subtype that mediates the inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion by peptide YY ( P10082 ) . In eight conscious dogs with chronic gastric and pancreatic fistulas , we compared the action of intravenous infusion of 200 and 400 pmol/kg/h of the Y receptor agonists P10082 1-36 , DB05004 , P10082 13-36 , Pro34PYY 1-36 , and P01303 1-36 on the pancreatic secretory response to secretin ( 20.5 pmol/kg/h ) and cerulein ( 29.6 pmol/kg/h ) . P10082 13-36 , Pro34PYY 1-36 , and P01303 1-36 were also studied by giving a fivefold dose ( 1,000 and 2,000 pmol/kg/h ) . P10082 1-36 and the P49146 agonist DB05004 significantly inhibited pancreatic secretory responses to secretin and cerulein , whereas inhibition by P01303 1-36 and the P49146 agonist P10082 13-36 was attainable only at doses of 1,000 and 2,000 pmol/kg/h . The Q03519 receptor agonist Pro34PYY 1-36 was without effect on pancreatic secretion . We conclude that in dogs the inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion by P10082 is mediated via P28062 receptors of a P10082 -preferring subtype .
