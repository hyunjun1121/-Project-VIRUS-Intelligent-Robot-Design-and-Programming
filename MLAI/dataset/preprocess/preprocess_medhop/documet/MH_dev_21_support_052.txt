DB00013 plasminogen activator cleaves its cell surface receptor releasing the ligand-binding domain . The cellular receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( Q03405 ) is a glycolipid-anchored three-domain membrane protein playing a central role in pericellular plasminogen activation . We have found that urokinase ( uPA ) can cleave its receptor between domains 1 and 2 generating a cell-associated Q03405 variant without ligand-binding properties . In extracts of U937 cells there are two Q03405 variants which after complete deglycosylation have apparent molecular masses of 35,000 and 27,000 . Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed that these variants represented the intact Q03405 and a two-domain form , Q03405 (2+3) , lacking ligand-binding domain 1 . Trypsin treatment showed that both variants are present on the outside of the cells . Addition to the culture medium of an anticatalytic monoclonal antibody to uPA inhibited the formation of the Q03405 (2+3) , indicating that uPA is involved in its generation . Purified Q03405 can be cleaved directly by uPA as well as by plasmin . The uPA-catalyzed cleavage does not require binding of the protease to the receptor through its epidermal growth factor-like receptor-binding domain , since low molecular weight uPA that lacks this domain also cleaves Q03405 . This unusual reaction in which a specific binding protein is proteolytically inactivated by its own ligand may represent a regulatory step in the plasminogen activation cascade .
