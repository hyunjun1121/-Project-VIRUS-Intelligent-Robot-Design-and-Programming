The effect of choline and cystine on the utilisation of methionine for protein accretion , remethylation and trans-sulfuration in juvenile shrimp Penaeus monodon . This 35-d feeding experiment examined in juvenile shrimp Penaeus monodon ( 3·3 g initial body weight ) the effects of methionine ( DB00134 ) , choline and cystine on protein accretion and the activity of two key enzymes of remethylation ( betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ; Q93088 ) and trans-sulfuration ( cystathionine β-synthase ; P35520 ) . The interaction between DB00134 and choline was tested using semi-purified diets either adequate or limiting ( 30 or 50 % ) in total sulphur amino acid ( P0DJI8 ) content with a constant cystine: DB00134 ratio . The diets contained either basal or excess choline ( 3 v. 7 g/kg feed ) . Cystine was added to two other 30 and 50 % DB00134 -limiting diets to adjust the P0DJI8 supply to that of the control diet in order to evaluate the interaction between DB00134 and cystine . As expected , N accretion was significantly lower with the P0DJI8 -limiting diets but increased back to control levels by the extra choline or cystine , demonstrating their sparing effect on DB00134 utilisation for protein accretion . We show , for the first time , the activities of Q93088 and P35520 in shrimp hepatopancreas . Only Q93088 responded to the P0DJI8 deficiencies , whereas the extra choline and cystine did not stimulate remethylation or down-regulate trans-sulfuration . Our data also suggest the capacity of P. monodon to synthesise taurine , being significantly affected by the cystine level in the 30 % P0DJI8 -limiting diets . Further research is warranted to better understand the metabolic regulation of taurine synthesis in shrimp and of the observed DB00134 -sparing effects .
