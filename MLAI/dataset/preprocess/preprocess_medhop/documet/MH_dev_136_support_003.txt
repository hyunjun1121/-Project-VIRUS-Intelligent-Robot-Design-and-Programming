Antitumor activity of sorafenib in human cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to P00533 and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Treatment of non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and colorectal cancer ( CRC ) have substantially changed in the last years with the introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitors in the clinical practice . The understanding of mechanisms which regulate cells sensitivity to these drugs is necessary for their optimal use.An in vitro model of acquired resistance to two tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) targeting the P00533 , erlotinib and gefitinib , and to a TKI targeting P00533 and VEGFR , vandetanib , was developed by continuously treating the human NSCLC cell line O43852 -3 and the human CRC cell line HCT116 with escalating doses of each drug . MTT , western blot analysis , migration , invasion and anchorage-independent colony forming assays were conducted in vitro and experiments with established xenografts in athymic nude mice were performed in vivo in sensitive , wild type ( WT ) and TKI-resistant O43852 -3 and HCT116 cell lines.As compared to WT O43852 -3 and HCT116 human cancer cells , TKI-resistant cell lines showed a significant increase in the levels of activated , phosphorylated AKT , MAPK , and of survivin . Considering the role of DB01367 and RAF as downstream signals of both the P00533 and VEGFR pathways , we treated resistant cells with sorafenib , an inhibitor of C-RAF , B-RAF , c- P10721 , P36888 , P07949 , P35968 , P35916 , and P09619 -Î² . DB00398 reduced the activation of MEK and MAPK and caused an inhibition of cell proliferation , invasion , migration , anchorage-independent growth in vitro and of tumor growth in vivo of all TKI-resistant O43852 -3 and HCT116 cell lines.These data suggest that resistance to P00533 inhibitors is predominantly driven by the DB01367 /RAF/MAPK pathway and can be overcame by treatment with sorafenib .
