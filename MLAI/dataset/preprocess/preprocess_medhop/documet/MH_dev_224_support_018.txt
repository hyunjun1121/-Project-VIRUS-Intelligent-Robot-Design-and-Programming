SAR and in vivo evaluation of 4-aryl-2-aminoalkylpyrimidines as potent and selective O60674 ( O60674 ) inhibitors . We report the discovery of a series of 4-aryl-2-aminoalkylpyrimidine derivatives as potent and selective O60674 inhibitors . High throughput screening of our in-house compound library led to the identification of hit 1 , from which optimization resulted in the discovery of highly potent and selective O60674 inhibitors . Advanced lead 10d demonstrated a significant dose-dependent pharmacodynamic and antitumor effect in a mouse xenograft model . Based upon the desirable profile of 10d ( DB05243 ) it was advanced into clinical trials .
