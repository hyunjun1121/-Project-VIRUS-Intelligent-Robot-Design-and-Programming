Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis : a helpful tool for subtyping French Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 isolates . The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis ( MLVA ) for typing and subtyping of Clostridium difficile . Sixty-eight strains were studied , including strains from PCR ribotypes 027 , 078/126 , 014/020/077 , 017 and 023 . The stability of variable-number tandem repeat ( VNTR ) loci was tested by comparing the MLVA results of two strains subcultured 11 times . After DNA extraction , seven tandem repeat loci ( A6 , P33681 , P13671 , E7 , P13726 , Q9UBA6 , Q13585 ) from published MLVA schemes were amplified by PCR and sequenced . The distance between two strains was determined by calculating the summed tandem repeat difference . Genomic diversity was evaluated by using the minimum spanning tree ( Bionumerics 5.1 software program ; Applied Maths ) . Among the 68 C. difficile isolates examined , 65 unique MLVA types were identified , suggesting a high discriminatory power . An overall good agreement was observed between MLVA types and PCR ribotypes . The stability of VNTR loci was good . MLVA could separate isolates of the hypervirulent PCR ribotype 027 clone in several clusters ; all 027 strains isolated within a hospital were grouped in a specific cluster or were placed very close to each other . Results of MLVA confirmed that strains from PCR ribotypes 078 and 126 were closely related although some were located in different branches of the tree . Similar results were observed for most strains from PCR ribotypes 014 , 020 and 077 . This highly discriminatory method is time-consuming and expensive , but is a valuable tool for subtyping of C. difficile , especially of 027 strains .
