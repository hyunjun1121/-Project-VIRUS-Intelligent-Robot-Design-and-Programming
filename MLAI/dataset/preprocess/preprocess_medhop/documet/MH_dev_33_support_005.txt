Induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein ameliorates atherosclerosis . BACKGROUND : Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) by macrophages results in activation of specific T cells , which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis . Oral tolerance induction and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Tolerance to oxLDL and malondialdehyde-treated LDL ( MDA-LDL ) was induced in P01130 -/- mice fed a Western-type diet by oral administration of oxLDL or MDA-LDL before the induction of atherogenesis . Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation ( 30 % to 71 % ; P < 0.05 ) and progression ( 45 % ; P < 0.05 ) of atherogenesis . Tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in P01730 + CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes , and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production . Tolerance to oxLDL also increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3 , P16410 , and CD25 in the plaque . In contrast , tolerance to MDA-LDL did not affect atherogenesis . CONCLUSIONS : OxLDL-specific T cells , present in P01130 -/- mice and important contributors in the immune response leading to atherosclerotic plaque , can be counteracted by oxLDL-specific P01730 + CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells activated via oral tolerance induction to oxLDL . We conclude that the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL may be a promising strategy to modulate the immune response during atherogenesis and a new way to treat atherosclerosis .
