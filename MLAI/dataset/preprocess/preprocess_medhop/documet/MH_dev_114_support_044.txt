Inhibition of P09917 pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in human neutrophils by sulfasalazine and DB00244 . The possible effect of sulfasalazine , DB00244 , and acetyl- DB00244 on endogenous arachidonic acid release and metabolism was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) . A new in vitro assay was used by which [1-14C]arachidonic acid is incorporated by purified peripheral PMNs until steady state was obtained ( 5 hr ) . After preincubation with the test drugs prior to activation with calcium ionophore A23187 , the released eicosanoids were isolated by extraction and thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) and quantitated by autoradiography and laser densitometry . Median drug concentrations needed for 50 % inhibition of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( 5-HETE ) release was 4-5 mM ( range 1-9 mM ) for both sulfasalazine and DB00244 . The acetylated derivative of DB00244 was ineffective . The present data suggest that inhibition of arachidonic acid lipoxygenation may be an essential action of sulfasalazine and its active metabolite , DB00244 . Interference with lipoxygenase enzymes , rather than a steroid-like inhibition of arachidonic acid release from intracellular phospholipids , seems to be the mode of action .
