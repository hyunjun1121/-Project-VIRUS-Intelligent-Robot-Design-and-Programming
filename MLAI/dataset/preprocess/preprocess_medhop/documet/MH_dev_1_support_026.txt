Role of arginine in superficial wound healing in man . DB00125 supplementation has been identified as advantageous in experimental wound healing . However , the mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect in tissue repair remain unresolved . Animal studies suggest that the beneficial role of arginine supplementation is mediated , at least in part through NO . The latter component mediates processes involved in tissue repair , including angiogenesis , epithelialization and collagen formation . This prospective study is performed to investigate arginine metabolism in acute surgical wounds in man . Expression of enzymes , known to be involved in arginine metabolism , was studied in donor sites of skin grafts of 10 hospitalized patients undergoing skin transplantation . Plasma and wound fluid levels of arginine metabolites ( ornithine , citrulline , nitrate and nitrite = NOx ) were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography . Expression of P35228 , P29474 , arginase-1 and arginase-2 was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of skin tissue . P05089 concentration was measured in plasma and wound fluid using ELISA . Arginase-2 was determined using Western blot analysis . We observed increased levels of citrulline , ornithine , NOx and arginase-1 in wound fluid when compared with plasma . Arginase-2 was expressed in both plasma and wound fluid and seemed higher in plasma . P35228 was expressed by neutrophils , macrophages , fibroblasts , keratinocytes and endothelial cells upon wounding , whereas P29474 reactivity was observed in endothelial cells and fibroblasts . P05089 was expressed in neutrophils post-wounding , while arginase-2 staining was observed in endothelial cells , keratinocytes , fibroblasts , macrophages and neutrophils . For the first time , human data support previous animal studies suggesting arginine metabolism for an NO- as well as arginase-mediated reparation of injured skin .
