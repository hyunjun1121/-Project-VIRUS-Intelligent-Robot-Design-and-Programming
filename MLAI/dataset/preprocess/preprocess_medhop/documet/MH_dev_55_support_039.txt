Curcumin : getting back to the roots . The use of turmeric , derived from the root of the plant Curcuma longa , for treatment of different inflammatory diseases has been described in Ayurveda and in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years . The active component of turmeric responsible for this activity , curcumin , was identified almost two centuries ago . Modern science has revealed that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets , including transcription factors ( e.g. , NF-kappaB , AP-1 , Egr-1 , beta-catenin , and P37231 ) , enzymes ( e.g. , P35354 , 5- P28300 , P35228 , and hemeoxygenase-1 ) , cell cycle proteins ( e.g. , cyclin D1 and P38936 ) , cytokines ( e.g. , P01375 , IL-1 , P05231 , and chemokines ) , receptors ( e.g. , P00533 and P04626 ) , and cell surface adhesion molecules . Because it can modulate the expression of these targets , curcumin is now being used to treat cancer , arthritis , diabetes , Crohn 's disease , cardiovascular diseases , osteoporosis , Alzheimer 's disease , psoriasis , and other pathologies . Interestingly , 6-gingerol , a natural analog of curcumin derived from the root of ginger ( Zingiber officinalis ) , exhibits a biologic activity profile similar to that of curcumin . The efficacy , pharmacologic safety , and cost effectiveness of curcuminoids prompt us to " get back to our roots . "
