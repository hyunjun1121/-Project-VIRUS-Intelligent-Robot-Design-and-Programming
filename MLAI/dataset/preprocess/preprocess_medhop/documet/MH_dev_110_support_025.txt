DB06155 , a selective cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist , inhibits atherosclerosis in P01130 -deficient mice . OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine whether the potent selective cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonist rimonabant has antiatherosclerotic properties . METHODS AND RESULTS : DB06155 ( 50 mg/kg/d in the diet ) significantly reduced food intake ( from 3.35+/-.04 to 2.80+/-0.03 g/d ) , weight gain ( from 14.6+/-0.7 g to -0.6+/-0.3 g ) , serum total cholesterol ( from 8.39+/-0.54 to 5.32+/-0.18 g/L ) , and atherosclerotic lesion development in the aorta ( from 1.7+/-0.22 to 0.21+/-0.037 mm(2) ) and aortic sinus ( from 101,000+/-7800 to 27,000+/-2900 microm(2) ) of P01130 (-/-) mice fed a Western-type diet for 3 months . DB06155 also reduced plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines P13500 and IL12 by 85 % ( P < 0.05 ) and 76 % ( P < 0.05 ) , respectively . Pair-fed animals had reduced weight gain ( 6.2+/-0.6 g gain ) , but developed atherosclerotic lesions which were as large as those of untreated animals , showing that the antiatherosclerotic effect of rimonabant is not related to reduced food intake . Interestingly , rimonabant at a lower dose ( 30 mg/kg/d in the diet ) reduced atherosclerosis development in the aortic sinus ( from 121,000+/-20,000 to 62,000+/-11,000 microm(2) , 49 % reduction , P < 0.05 ) , without affecting serum total cholesterol ( 7.8+/-0.7 g/L versus 8.1+/-1.3 g/L in the control group ) . DB06155 decreased lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - and IL1beta-induced proinflammatory gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro as well as thioglycollate-induced recruitment of macrophages in vivo ( 10 mg/kg , p.o. bolus ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results show that rimonabant has antiatherosclerotic effects in P01130 (-/-) mice . These effects are partly unrelated to serum cholesterol modulation and could be related to an antiinflammatory effect .
