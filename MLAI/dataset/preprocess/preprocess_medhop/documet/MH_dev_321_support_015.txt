DB00067 -induced cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium signaling in embryonic cortical astrocytes : dynamics of calcium and calcium-dependent kinase translocation . The present study sought to determine the downstream consequences of V1a vasopressin receptor ( P37288 ) activation of Ca2+ signaling in cortical astrocytes . Results of these analyses demonstrated that P37288 activation led to a marked increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear Ca2+ . We also investigated P37288 activation of Ca2+-activated signaling kinases , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) , and the mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases [ MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) ] , their localization within cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments , and activation of their downstream nuclear target , the transcription factor DB02527 response element-binding protein ( CREB ) . Results of these analyses demonstrated that P37288 activation led to a significant rise in PKC , CaMKII , and P27361 /2 activation , with CaMKII and P27361 /2 demonstrating dynamic transport between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments . Although no evidence of PKC translocation was apparent , PKC and CaMKs were required for activation and nuclear translocation of P27361 /2 . Subsequent to CaMKII and P27361 /2 translocation to the nucleus , CREB activation occurred and was found to be dependent on upstream activation of P27361 /2 and CaMKs . These data provide the first systematic analysis of the P37288 -induced Ca2+ signaling cascade in cortical astrocytes . In addition , results of this study introduce a heretofore unknown effect of vasopressin , dynamic Ca2+ signaling between the cytoplasm and nucleus that leads to comparable dynamics of kinase activation and shuttling between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments . Implications for development and regeneration induced by P37288 activation of CREB-regulated gene expression in cortical astrocytes are discussed .
