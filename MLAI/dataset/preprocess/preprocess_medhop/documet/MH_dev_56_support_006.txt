Agonism at P41595 receptors is not a class effect of the ergolines . Restrictive cardiac valvulopathies observed in Parkinson patients treated with the ergoline dopamine agonist pergolide have recently been associated with the agonist efficacy of the drug at 5-hydroxytryptamine2B ( P41595 ) receptors . To evaluate whether agonism at P41595 receptors is a phenomenon of the class of the ergolines , we studied P41595 receptor-mediated relaxation in porcine pulmonary arteries to five ergolines which are used as antiparkinsonian drugs . DB01186 and cabergoline were potent full agonists in this tissue ( pEC50 8.42 and 8.72 ) . DB01200 acted as a partial agonist ( pEC50 6.86 ) . Lisuride and terguride , however , failed to relax the arteries but potently antagonized 5-HT-induced relaxation ( pKB 10.32 and 8.49 ) . Thus , agonism at P41595 receptors seems not to be a class effect of the ergolines .
