Drug-induced activation of SREBP-controlled lipogenic gene expression in CNS-related cell lines : marked differences between various antipsychotic drugs . BACKGROUND : The etiology of schizophrenia is unknown , but neurodevelopmental disturbances , myelin- and oligodendrocyte abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction have been suggested as pathophysiological factors in this severe psychiatric disorder . DB04540 is an essential component of myelin and has proved important for synapse formation . Recently , we demonstrated that the antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol stimulate lipogenic gene expression in cultured glioma cells through activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) transcription factors . We here compare the action of chlorpromazine , haloperidol , clozapine , olanzapine , risperidone and ziprasidone on SREBP activation and SREBP-controlled gene expression ( ACAT2 , P04035 , Q01581 , P14324 , O75845 , Q9UBM7 , P01130 , P49327 and SCD1 ) in four CNS-relevant human cell lines . RESULTS : There were marked differences in the ability of the antipsychotic drugs to activate the expression of SREBP target genes , with clozapine and chlorpromazine as the most potent stimulators in a context of therapeutically relevant concentrations . Glial-like cells ( GaMg glioma and CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cell lines ) displayed more pronounced drug-induced SREBP activation compared to the response in Q9UL51 human cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , indicating that antipsychotic-induced activation of lipogenesis is most prominent in glial cells . CONCLUSION : Our present data show a marked variation in the ability of different antipsychotics to induce SREBP-controlled transcriptional activation of lipogenesis in cultured human CNS-relevant cells . We propose that this effect could be relevant for the therapeutic efficacy of some antipsychotic drugs .
