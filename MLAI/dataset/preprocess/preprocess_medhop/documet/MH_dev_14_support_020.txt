Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) sparing effects of glucosamine hydrochloride through N-glycosylation inhibition ; strategy to rescue stomach from NSAID damage . Gastrointestinal or cardiovascular complications limit nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) prescription . DB01296 hydrochloride ( GS-HCl ) alternatively chosen , but debates still exist in its clinical efficiency . P35354 instability through inhibiting P35354 N-glycosylation of GS-HCl raised the possibility of NSAID sparing effect . Study was done to determine whether combination treatment of glucosamine and NSAID contributes to gastric safety through NSAID sparing effect . IEC-6 cells were stimulated with P01375 -α and compared the expressions of inflammatory mediators after indomethacin alone or combination of indomethacin and GS-HCl by Western blotting and RT-PCR . C57BL/6 mice injected with type II collagen to induce arthritis were treated with indomethacin alone or combination of reduced dose of indomethacin and GS-HCl after 3 weeks . P01375 -α increased the expression of P35354 , P35228 and inflammatory cytokines , but GS-HCl significantly attenuated P01375 -α-induced P35354 expression . Decreased P35354 after GS-HCl was caused by N-glycosylation inhibition as much as tunicamycin . Combination of reduced dose of indomethacin and GS-HCl significantly reduced the expressions of P05362 , P19320 , P10145 , IL-1β , P08253 , P09237 , P14780 , and P24347 mRNA as well as NF-κB activation better than high dose indomethacin alone . These NSAID sparing effect of GS-HCl was further proven in collagen-induced arthritis model . Combination of GS-HCl and 2.5 mg/kg indomethacin showed significant protection from gastric damages as well as efficacious anti-arthritic effect . Taken together , P35354 N-glycosylation inhibition by GS-HCl led to indomethacin sparing effects , based on which combination of GS-HCl and reduced dose of NSAID can provide the strategy to secure stomach from NSAID-induced gastric damage as well as excellent anti-arthritic effects .
