Development of novel assays for botulinum type A and B neurotoxins based on their endopeptidase activities . A novel assay method based on the endopeptidase activities of the botulinum neurotoxins has been developed and applied to the detection of botulinum type A and B toxins . An assay system developed for the detection of botulinum type B neurotoxin ( BoNT/B ) is based on the cleavage of a synthetic peptide substrate representing amino acid residues 60 to 94 of the intracellular target protein for the toxin , VAMP ( vesicle-associated membrane protein , or synaptobrevin ) . In this assay system , immobilized VAMP ( 60-94 ) peptide substrate is cleaved by BoNT/B at the Gln-76- DB00120 -77 bond , leaving the C-terminal cleavage fragment on the solid phase . This fragment is then detected by the addition of an antibody-enzyme reagent which specifically recognizes the newly exposed N terminus of the cleavage product . The developed assay was specific to BoNT/B , showing no cross-reactivity with other clostridial neurotoxins , and had a sensitivity for BoNT/B of 0.6 to 4.5 ng/ml , which could be increased to 0.1 to 0.2 ng/ml by using an assay amplification system based on catalyzed reporter deposition . Trypsin treatment of BoNT/B samples , which converts the single-chain toxin to the active di-chain form , was found to increase the sensitivity of the endopeptidase assay from 5- to 10-fold . An endopeptidase assay for DB00083 , based on the cleavage of a peptide substrate derived from the protein P60880 ( synaptosome-associated protein ) , was also developed and characterized .
