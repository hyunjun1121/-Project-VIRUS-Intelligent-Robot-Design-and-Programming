Rainbow trout somatostatin receptor subtypes SSTR1A , SSTR1B , and P30874 differentially activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways in transfected cells . Previously , we reported that extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and protein kinase B ( Akt ) , a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , mediated somatostatin ( SS ) inhibition of P10912 , IGF1 , and IGF1 receptor expression . In this study , we used Chinese hamster ovary- P04264 cells that stably transfected individually with trout SS receptors ( SSTR1A , SSTR1B , and P30874 ) to elucidate receptor-effector pathway linkages . SS induced P29323 and Akt activation in a time- and concentration-related manner in all SSTR-expressing cells ; however , the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated to a greater extent through SSTR1A than through either SSTR1B or P30874 , whereas the P29323 pathway was activated to a greater extent though P30874 than through either SSTR1A or SSTR1B . Although the P29323 pathway inhibitor U0126 had no effect on Akt activation , the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced P29323 activation to near control levels in all SSTR-expressing cell lines , suggesting some cross talk between the pathways , possibly at the level of c-Raf , the phosphorylation of which also was induced by SS via each SSTR . Pertussis toxin ( PTX ) completely abolished SS-induced activation of P29323 and Akt in SSTR1A- , SSTR1B- , and P30874 -expressing cells , suggesting that these receptors link to the P29323 and PI3K/Akt pathways via PTX-sensitive G-proteins . SS-induced activation of Elk1 , Stat3 , and C/EBPÎ² also was mediated by each of the trout SSTRs . These findings establish important receptor-effector pathway linkages for fish SSTRs and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which SSs may elicit diverse physiological effects in target cells .
