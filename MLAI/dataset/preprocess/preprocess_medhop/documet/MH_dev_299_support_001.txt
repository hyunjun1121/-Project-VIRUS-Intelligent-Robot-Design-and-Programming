P13726 -independent effects of recombinant factor VIIa on hemostasis . The molecular mechanisms responsible for the hemostatic efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII ( DB00036 ; NovoSeven , Novo Nordisk , Bagsvaerd , Denmark ) in platelet-related bleeding disorders remain unclear . The general concept is that DB00036 locally enhances thrombin generation at the site of injury , where tissue factor ( TF ) has become exposed . However , a growing amount of evidence shows that DB00036 is also able to exert its activity in a manner independent of TF . Using an in vitro flow model , we recently showed that TF-independent thrombin generation is responsible for increased platelet deposition onto injured vessels following DB00036 administration . Furthermore , it has been shown that DB00036 can restore platelet aggregation in Glanzmann 's thrombasthenia ( GT ) patients via TF-independent thrombin generation . However , the mechanism behind TF-independent thrombin generation remains to be elucidated . It is postulated that , in vivo , both the TF-dependent and TF-independent thrombin generation induced by DB00036 contribute to the control of hemorrhage in patients with platelet-related bleeding disorders and , perhaps , other causes of hemorrhagic diatheses .
