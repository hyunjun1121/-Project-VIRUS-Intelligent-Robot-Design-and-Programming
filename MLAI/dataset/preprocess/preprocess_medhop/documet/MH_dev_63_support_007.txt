Organic anion transporting polypeptide-C mediates arsenic uptake in P29320 -293 cells . Arsenic is an established human carcinogen . The role of aquaglyroporins ( AQPs ) in arsenic disposition was recently identified . In order to examine whether organic anion transporting polypeptide-C ( Q9Y6L6 ) also plays a role in arsenic transport , Q9Y6L6 cDNA was transfected into cells of a human embryonic kidney cell line ( P29320 -293 ) . Transfection increased uptake of the model Q9Y6L6 substrate , estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide , by 10-fold . In addition , we measured uptake and cytotoxicity of arsenate , arsenite , monomethylarsonate(MMA(V)) , and dimethylarsinate ( P28067 (V) ) . Transfection of Q9Y6L6 increased uptake and cytotoxicity of arsenate and arsenite , but not of MMA(V) or P28067 (V) . DB01045 and taurocholic acid ( a substrate of Q9Y6L6 ) reversed the increased toxicity of arsenate and arsenite seen in Q9Y6L6 -transfected cells . The increase in uptake of inorganic arsenic was not as great as that of estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide . Our results suggest that Q9Y6L6 can transport inorganic arsenic in a ( DB00143 ) -dependent manner . However , this may not be the major pathway for arsenic transport .
