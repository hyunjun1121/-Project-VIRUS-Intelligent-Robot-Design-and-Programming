Novel P00533 inhibitors prepared by combination of dithiocarbamic acid esters and 4-anilinoquinazolines . On the basis of combination strategy , a novel series of P00533 inhibitors were designed and synthesized by combination of dithiocarbamic acid esters and 4-anilinoquinazolines . The effect of the synthesized compounds on cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay in three human cancer cell lines : MDA-MB-468 , SK-BR-3 and HCT-116 . Two compounds ( 11d and 11f ) were found more potent against all three cell lines and five compounds ( 11a , 11d-11g ) were found more potent against both MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 than DB01259 . SAR studies revealed that the substituents on P13671 and P10643 positions of quinazoline , the amine component of dithiocarbamate moiety and the linker greatly affected the activity . This work provides a promising new strategy for the preparation of potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
