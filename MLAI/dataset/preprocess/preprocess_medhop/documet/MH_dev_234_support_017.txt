DB00174 synthetase : regulation by cell stress and involvement in tumor biology . DB00174 synthetase ( P08243 ) catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and glutamine to asparagine and glutamate in an DB00171 -dependent reaction . The enzyme is ubiquitous in its organ distribution in mammals , but basal expression is relatively low in tissues other than the exocrine pancreas . Human P08243 activity is highly regulated in response to cell stress , primarily by increased transcription from a single gene located on chromosome 7 . Among the genomic elements that control P08243 transcription is the C/EBP- P39905 response element ( CARE ) within the promoter . Protein limitation or an imbalanced dietary amino acid composition activate the P08243 gene through the amino acid response ( AAR ) , a process that is replicated in cell culture through limitation for any single essential amino acid . Endoplasmic reticulum stress also increases P08243 transcription through the Q9NZJ5 -eIF2- P18848 arm of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) . Both the AAR and UPR lead to increased synthesis of P18848 , which binds to the CARE and induces P08243 transcription . Elevated expression of P08243 protein is associated with resistance to asparaginase therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may be a predictive factor in drug sensitivity for certain solid tumors as well . Activation of the Q9P2K8 -eIF2- P18848 signaling pathway , leading to increased P08243 expression appears to be a component of solid tumor adaptation to nutrient deprivation and/or hypoxia . Identifying the roles of P08243 in fetal development , tissue differentiation , and tumor growth may reveal that P08243 function extends beyond asparagine biosynthesis .
