Impact of genetic factors ( P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P78329 ) on warfarin dose requirement in the Turkish population . DB00682 has a narrow therapeutic index and displays marked person-to-person variation in dose requirement . Functional polymorphisms at candidate genes can therefore offer utility as biomarkers to individualize warfarin treatment . The main objective of this study was to determine whether and to what extent variability in warfarin dose requirements was determined by polymorphisms in P11712 , Q9BQB6 , P78329 ( rs2108622 ) and P07099 ( rs2292566 ) in the Turkish population . Patients ( n = 107 ) who had stable doses and international normalized ratio ( INRs ) at their last three consecutive visits were registered . Their demographic factors , concurrent medications , warfarin-related bleedings or thromboembolisms , smoking , alcohol intake and weekly green vegetable consumption were recorded . From a blood sample , DNA was isolated and genotyped by real-time PCR for polymorphisms of P11712 , Q9BQB6 , P78329 and P07099 . A regression analysis was used to determine the independent effects of genetic and non-genetic factors on warfarin dose optimization . In our study , in addition to age , genetic variants of P11712 , Q9BQB6 and P78329 were found to be significant predictor variables for the maintenance dose for warfarin , explaining 39.3 % of dose variability . Q9BQB6 and P11712 genotypes remain predictor variables of the warfarin dose , and we first found that P78329 ( rs2108622 ) contributes to dose variability in the Turkish population as well . These observations may be of benefit to future translation research with a view to global personalized medicine in regions hitherto understudied such as the Turkish population so as to rationalize initial warfarin dose and reduce the burden of frequent INR measurements .
