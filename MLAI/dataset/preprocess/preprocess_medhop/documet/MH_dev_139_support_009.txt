Combined thrombophilic polymorphisms in women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage . OBJECTIVE : To identify associations or interrelations between carriage of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( P42898 ) C677T , the P42898 A1298C , the factor V Leiden G1691A , the factor II prothrombin G20210A , the human platelet antigen ( Q9Y251 ) 1 C12548T , and the apolipoprotein ( APO ) B R3500Q polymorphisms and idiopathic recurrent miscarriage ( IRM ) . DESIGN : Prospective case control study . SETTING : Academic research institution . PATIENT(S) : One hundred forty-five women with a history of three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks gestation and 101 healthy postmenopausal women with at least two live births and no history of pregnancy loss . INTERVENTION(S) : Peripheral venous punctures . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the different alleles of six candidate genetic risk factors for IRM ( P42898 C677T , P42898 A1298C , factor V Leiden G1691A , factor II prothrombin G20210A , Q9Y251 1 C12548T , and the APO B R3500Q ) . RESULT(S) : Allele and genotype frequencies of all polymorphisms were not significantly different between the study and the control groups . Also , no significant associations occurred between combinations of polymorphisms and the occurrence of IRM . CONCLUSION(S) : Our data fall short of showing any significant association between single polymorphisms of the P42898 , the Factor V Leiden , the Factor II P00734 , the Q9Y251 1 and APO B genes or combinations of these polymorphisms and the occurrence of IRM .
