Pathogenesis and treatment of thrombohemorrhagic diathesis in acute promyelocytic leukemia . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a distinct subtype of myeloid leukemia characterized by t(15;17) chromosomal translocation , which involves the retinoic acid receptor-alpha ( P10276 ) . APL typically presents with a life-threatening hemorrhagic diathesis . Before the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) for the cure of APL , fatal hemorrhages due , at least in part , to the APL-associated coagulopathy , were a major cause of induction remission failure . The laboratory abnormalities of blood coagulation found in these patients indicate the occurrence of a hypercoagulable state . Major determinants of the coagulopathy of APL are endogenous factors expressed by the leukemic cells , including procoagulant factors , fibrinolytic proteins , and non-specific proteolytic enzymes . In addition , these cells have an increased capacity to adhere to the vascular endothelium , and to secrete inflammatory cytokines [ i.e. interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) ] , which in turn stimulate the expression of prothrombotic activities by endothelial cells and leukocytes . DB00755 can interfere with each of the principal hemostatic properties of the leukemic cell , thus reducing the APL cell procoagulant potential , in parallel to the induction of cellular differentiation . This effect occurs in vivo , in the bone marrow of APL patients receiving DB00755 , and is associated with the improvement of the bleeding symptoms . Therapy with arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) also beneficially affects coagulation in APL . However , early deaths from bleeding still remain a major problem in APL and further research is required in this field . In this review , we will summarize our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of the APL-associated coagulopathy and will overview the therapeutic approaches for the management of this complication .
