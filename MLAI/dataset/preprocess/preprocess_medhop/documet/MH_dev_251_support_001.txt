[ DB09053 : A new drug of B-cell malignancies ] . DB09053 ( Imbruvica® ) is a first-in-class , orally administered once-daily , that inhibits B-cell antigen receptor signaling downstream of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) . DB09053 has been approved in USA in February 2014 and in France in October 2014 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( Q8WXI8 ) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) and for the treatment of patients with CLL and a chromosome 17 deletion ( del 17p ) or P04637 mutation . In clinical studies , ibrutinib induced an impressive overall response rate ( 68 % ) in patients with relapsed/refractory Q8WXI8 ( phase II study ) . In CLL , ibrutinib has shown to significantly improve progression-free survival , response rate and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL , including in those with del 17p . DB09053 had an acceptable tolerability profile . Less than 10 % of patients discontinued their treatment because of adverse events . Results are pending in other B-cell lymphomas subtypes such as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in follicular lymphoma . An approval extension has already been enregistered for Waldenström disease in USA in January 2015 . Given its efficacy and tolerability , ibrutinib is an emerging treatment option for patients with B-cell malignancies .
