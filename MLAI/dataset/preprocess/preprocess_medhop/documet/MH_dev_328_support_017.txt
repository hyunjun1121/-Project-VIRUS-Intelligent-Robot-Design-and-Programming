DB00945 and NSAID sensitivity . DB00945 and the older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) that block cyclo-oxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) induce asthma attacks in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and urticaria in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria . Weak inhibitors of P23219 , such as acetaminophen and salsalate , crossreact also but only with high doses of the drugs . Partial inhibitors of both P23219 and P35354 , such as nimesulide and meloxicam , also cross-react but only at high drug doses . P35354 inhibitors do not cross-react ; however , all NSAIDs , including the selective P35354 inhibitors , can sensitize patients and induce urticaria or anaphylaxis on next exposure to the drug .
