Downregulation of phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) activates protein kinase A and contributes to the progression of prostate cancer . BACKGROUND : Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in American men . Unfortunately , few successful therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) exist . The protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway is a critical mediator of cellular proliferation and differentiation in various normal and cancerous cells . However , the PKA activity and the mechanism of regulation in CRPC remain unclear . Then , in this study , we intended to reveal the PKA activity and the mechanism of regulation in CRPC . METHODS : Western blotting , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , cytotoxicity analysis , and cell proliferation assay were used to resolve the regulatory role of PKA in prostate cancer cell line , LNCaP and their derivatives . RESULTS : DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) was downregulated and the PKA pathway was activated in castration-resistant LNCaP derivatives ( CxR cells ) . DB01954 activated the PKA pathway via inhibition of Q07343 , resulting in AR transactivation while the PKA inhibitor , H89 reduced AR transactivation . In response to hydrogen peroxide and in hydrogen peroxide-resistant LNCaP derivatives ( HPR50 cells ) Q07343 was decreased and as a result PKA activity was increased . Moreover , Q07343 expression was reduced in advanced prostate cancer and Q07343 knockdown promoted castration-resistant growth of LNCaP cells . CONCLUSIONS : Oxidative stress may suppress Q07343 expression and activate the PKA pathway . The Q07343 /PKA pathway contributed to progression of androgen-dependent prostate cancer to CRPC . This pathway may represent an attractive therapeutic molecular target .
