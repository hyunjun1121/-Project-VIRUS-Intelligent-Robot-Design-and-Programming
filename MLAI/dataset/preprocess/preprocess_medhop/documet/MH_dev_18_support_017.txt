Pharmacologic activation of mitochondrial biogenesis exerts widespread beneficial effects in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington 's disease . There is substantial evidence that impairment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -γ-coactivator 1α ( P20142 -1α ) levels and activity play an important role in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) pathogenesis . We tested whether pharmacologic treatment with the pan- Q07869 agonist bezafibrate would correct a deficiency of P20142 -1α and exert beneficial effects in a transgenic mouse model of HD . We found that administration of bezafibrate in the diet restored levels of P20142 -1α , PPARs and downstream genes to levels which occur in wild-type mice . There were significant improvements in phenotype and survival . In the striatum , astrogliosis and neuronal atrophy were attenuated and numbers of mitochondria were increased . DB01393 treatment prevented conversion of type I oxidative to type II glycolytic muscle fibers and increased the numbers of muscle mitochondria . Finally , bezafibrate rescued lipid accumulation and apparent vacuolization of brown adipose tissue in the HD mice . These findings provide strong evidence that treatment with bezafibrate exerts neuroprotective effects which may be beneficial in the treatment of HD .
