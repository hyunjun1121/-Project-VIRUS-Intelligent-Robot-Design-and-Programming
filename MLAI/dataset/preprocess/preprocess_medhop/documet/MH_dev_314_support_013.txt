Potential utility of telmisartan , an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) -modulating activity for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders . The metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus . There is widespread agreement that the renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in diabetes . Indeed , large clinical trials have demonstrated substantial benefit of the blockade of this system for cardiovascular end-organ protection . Thus the blockade of the DB01367 may be a promising strategy for the treatment of the patients with the metabolic syndrome . Although several types of angiotensin II type 1 ( AT(1) ) receptor blockers ( ARBs ) are commercially available for the treatment of patients with hypertension , we have recently found that telmisartan ( DB00966 ) could have the strongest binding affinity to AT(1) receptor . Further , telmisartan is reported to act as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . These observations suggest that , due to its unique P37231 -modulating activity , telmisartan may be one of the most promising sartans for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders . In this paper , we reviewed the potential utility of telmisartan in insulin resistance and vascular complications in diabetes .
