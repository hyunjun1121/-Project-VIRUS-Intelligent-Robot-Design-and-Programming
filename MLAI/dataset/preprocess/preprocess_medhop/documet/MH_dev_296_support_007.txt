Increased susceptibility of small intestine to NSAID-provoked ulceration in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis : involvement of enhanced expression of O00206 . NSAIDs damage the small intestine as well as the stomach as adverse effects . We previously reported that the gastric ulcerogenic response to NSAIDs was markedly increased in arthritic rats . The present study was designed to examine the intestinal ulcerogenic property of indomethacin in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats in comparison with normal animals . Arthritis was induced in male Dark Agouti rats by injection of Freund 's complete adjuvant into the right hindfoot . Two weeks later , indomethacin was given orally and the intestine was examined for lesions at several time points after indomethacin . Indomethacin produced intestinal lesions in both normal and arthritic rats , but in the latter , the ulcerogenic response occurred much earlier and the severity was markedly enhanced . DB02533 , an inhibitor of P35228 , significantly suppressed the damage , yet the efficacy differed in normal and arthritic rats , depending on the dose schedule ; the effect of post-administration ( 6 h after ) was greater than that of pre-administration ( 0.5 h before ) in normal rats , whereas that of post-administration was less than that of pre-administration in arthritic rats . The expression of P35228 and O00206 in the intestine was enhanced in arthritic rats as compared with normal rats . These results suggest that the intestinal ulcerogenic response to indomethacin is markedly aggravated in arthritic rats . Notably , the onset of the ulceration was much earlier in arthritic rats than normal rats . These phenomena may be accounted for by the upregulation of P35228 /NO through the increased expression of O00206 in the small intestine of arthritic rats .
