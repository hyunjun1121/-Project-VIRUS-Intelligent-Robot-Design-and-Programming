Aging impairs induction of cyclin-dependent kinases and down-regulation of p27 in mouse P01730 (+) cells . To define the link between the early activation defects and the impaired proliferation response of cells from old mice , we characterized the influence of age on expression and activity of proteins that participate in cell-cycle regulation . We found that aging led to significant declines in the ability of mouse P01730 (+) T cells to respond to CD3 and P10747 stimuli by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinases P24941 , P11802 , and Q00534 , whether the defect was assessed by protein level or functional activity . Induction of P24941 activity was also impaired in cells from old mice that were activated with PMA plus ionomycin , stimuli that bypass the TCR/CD3 complex , or by CD3/ P10747 in the presence of P60568 , indicating that the age-related changes lie , at least in part , downstream of the enzymes activated by these stimuli . We also noted an impairment in the ability of P01730 (+) cells from old mice to down-regulate the CDK inhibitor p27 after activation , but we found no change in induction of P38936 , an inhibitor of CDK that may also play other roles in cell-cycle control . Altered CDK activation is likely to mediate the age-related decline in T cell proliferation to polyclonal stimulation .
