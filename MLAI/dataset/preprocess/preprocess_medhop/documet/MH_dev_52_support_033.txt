Human gray matter : feasibility of single-slab 3D double inversion-recovery high-spatial-resolution MR imaging . The purpose of this study was to develop and prospectively evaluate the feasibility of a single-slab three-dimensional ( 3D ) double inversion-recovery , or P30518 , sequence for magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T . The study was approved by the local ethics committee , and informed consent was obtained from six healthy control subjects ( one woman , five men ; age range , 26-47 years ) and two patients with multiple sclerosis ( one woman , aged 39 ; one man , aged 56 ) . Gray matter ( GM ) -only images were obtained by selectively suppressing cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) and white matter ( WM ) signals . Whole-brain high-spatial-resolution 3D images ( 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.3 mm ) were acquired within 10 minutes . Cortical and deep GM structures were clearly delineated from WM and P04141 , and there were regional differences in GM signal intensity . No flow artifacts from blood or P04141 were observed . These GM images with high spatial resolution are suitable to identify cortical pathologic conditions and can potentially be used for segmentation purposes to determine cortical thickness or volume .
