Serotonergic regulation of somatosensory cortical development : lessons from genetic mouse models . Monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems appear early during embryogenesis , suggesting that they could play important roles in brain development . Accumulated evidence indicates that serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) regulates neural as well as nonneural development , including early aspects of embryonic development , differentiation of neuronal progenitors , and morphogenesis of the craniofacial region , heart and limb . Recent studies using monoamine oxidase-A ( P21397 ) , 5-HT transporter , vesicular monoamine transporter-2 ( Q05940 ) and P28222 receptor single , double and triple knockout mice have provided evidence that the serotonergic system plays important roles in barrel field formation in the developing somatosensory cortex . Here we review evidence from these genetic mouse models and , based on the accumulated evidence , propose a testable model for future studies of mechanisms underlying serotonergic regulation of cortical development .
