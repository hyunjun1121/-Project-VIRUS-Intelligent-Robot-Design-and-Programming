The high molecular mass , glycoprotein Ib-binding protein flavocetin-A induces only small platelet aggregates in vitro . The direct effects of snake venom glycoprotein ( GP ) Ib-binding proteins on platelet receptors during the formation of platelet aggregates were determined by a particle counting method using light scattering . Flavocetin-A induces small platelet aggregates , but not medium or large ones . However , neither jararaca GPIb-BP nor tokaracetin induce platelet aggregation . The flavocetin-A dose-response curve for formation of small aggregates is bell-shaped , with maximal effect at 1 to 2 microg/mL . The formation of small aggregates was not observed when fixed human platelets were used . Jararaca GPIb-BP , the anti-GPIb monoclonal antibody GUR83-35 , prostaglandin I2 , and ethylene diamine-N,N-dimethylformamide all inhibited flavocetin-A-induced small aggregate formation , but acetylsalicylic acid did not . Furthermore , anti- P08514 /IIIa monoclonal antibodies , DB00054 , and YM337 significantly but partially inhibited aggregate formation , but the anti- P04275 monoclonal antibody NMC-4 had no effect . The formation of small aggregates required extracellular calcium , but flavocetin-A did not elevate cytosolic calcium . These results suggest that flavocetin-A binds to intact platelets , initiating platelet responses and inducing platelet aggregate formation by cross-linking platelets . Consequently , flavocetin-A may be a useful tool to study the mechanism of GPIb-mediated platelet activation and the structure-function relationships of GPIb .
