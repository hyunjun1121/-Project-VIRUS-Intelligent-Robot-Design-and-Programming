Drug insight : Use of docetaxel in prostate and urothelial cancers . Taxanes have emerged as a potent class of chemotherapeutic agents in many malignancies , with two taxanes now in clinical use . Their mechanism of action against tumor cells is by alteration of microtubule dynamics , which causes cell-cycle arrest during mitosis . DB01248 binds to the microtubules with a higher affinity than paclitaxel , and over a broader range of cell-cycle activities . It has also been shown to promote apoptosis via P10415 phosphorylation . In hormone-refractory prostate cancer , docetaxel has been studied as both a single agent and in combination with estramustine , and in different treatment schedules , with demonstrated efficacy . Two phase III trials have confirmed a survival benefit , making docetaxel the first chemotherapy agent with proven efficacy against prostate cancer . In urothelial cancer , docetaxel has demonstrated activity and has been investigated as a single agent and in combination regimens . A phase III trial comparing docetaxel and cisplatin to methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin was inferior when evaluating response rates and overall survival . More recent phase II trials combining docetaxel with two additional agents have shown promise , but confirmatory trials are needed .
