Effect of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor antagonism on platelet membrane glycoproteins after coronary stent placement . Platelet membrane glycoproteins play a crucial role in ischemic complications after coronary stenting . Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa blockade reduces adverse clinical events after angioplasty but is associated with rare but profound thrombocytopenia that might increase hemorrhagic complications . Changes in platelet membrane glycoproteins of patients with angina who underwent coronary stenting and were treated with the P08514 -IIIa antagonist abciximab ( n=20 ) or with heparin ( n=23 ) were studied . GPIb-IIIa receptor blockade and membrane glycoproteins were evaluated with immunological markers in venous blood samples taken before . 10 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h after initial treatment with either abciximab or heparin . Patients receiving abciximab therapy showed a rapid inhibition of binding of fluorochrome-conjugated mAb CD41 and c7E3 concomitant with a reduction in platelet aggregation which was restored in part in the days after termination of abciximab infusion . Induction of ligand-induced binding sites on P08514 -IIIa was increased in patients receiving abciximab . The expression of ligand-induced binding sites correlated inversely with platelet count . No significant change in platelet membrane markers were found in the heparin group . In vitro studies showed that abciximab induces ligand-induced binding sites on isolated platelets and on nuclear cells bearing recombinant P08514 -IIIa . DB00054 rapidly achieves P08514 -IIIa receptor blockade after coronary stent placement that might be beneficial in high-risk settings to bridge the delayed action of ticlopidine . Significant alterations of platelet membrane glycoproteins during P08514 -IIIa antagonism might contribute to development of acute profound thrombocytopenia .
