DB00087 in peripheral T-cell malignancies . The humanized monoclonal antibody CAMPATH-1H ( alemtuzumab ) binds to the P31358 antigen , a glycoprotein that is widely expressed on normal and malignant B- and T-lymphocytes . Over the past 5 years , a number of trials have demonstrated that alemtuzumab has clinical activity in mature T-cell diseases such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . In heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory patients alemtuzumab induced responses in more than two thirds of T-PLL and more than 50 % of CTCL patients . Responding patients had improved survival compared to nonresponders . DB00087 is particularly effective in clearing malignant lymphocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow and may therefore facilitate stem-cell transplantation ( P09683 ) in selected patients . The toxicity profile for the antibody is acceptable ; the major complications are infusional reactions , which generally subside after the first 1-2 weeks of therapy , and prolonged lymphopenia associated with reactivation of viruses . These can be minimized by careful monitoring and the use of prophylactic therapy . Future studies will be directed toward : alternative routes ( subcutaneous ) and schedules of administration ; use as first-line therapy ; combination strategies with conventional chemotherapy ; and use of alemtuzumab to purge minimal residual bone-marrow disease prior to P09683 .
