Overexpression of cytochrome P450 4F2 in mice increases 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production and arterial blood pressure . P78329 ( P78329 ) activity is thought to be a factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension through its bioactive metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( 20-HETE ) . We previously found that a gain-in-function P78329 variant in a Chinese cohort was associated with elevated urinary 20-HETE and hypertension . To further explore this association we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing P78329 driven by a modified mouse kidney androgen-regulated protein promoter . This heterologous promoter regulated the expression of luciferase and his-tagged P78329 in transfected P29320 293 cells . In the kidney of transgenic mice , P78329 was localized to renal proximal tubule epithelia and was expressed at a higher level than in control mice , leading to increased urinary 20-HETE excretion . Assessment of P78329 activity by an arachidonic acid hydroxylation assay showed that 20-HETE production was significantly higher in kidney microsomes of transgenic mice compared to control mice , as was their systolic blood pressure . There was a positive correlation of blood pressure with urinary 20-HETE levels . Our results show that increased expression of P78329 in mice enhanced 20-HETE production and elevated blood pressure .
