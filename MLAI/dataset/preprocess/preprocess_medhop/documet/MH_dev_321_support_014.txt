Serotonergic mechanisms in human allergic contact dermatitis . Expression of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) , 5-HT receptors 1A ( 5-HT1AR ) and 2A , and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) was studied in positive epicutaneous reactions to nickel sulphate in nickel-allergic patients , at 72 h post-challenge with the antigen . In addition , the effects of 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) citalopram and fluoxetine , were tested on nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nickel-allergic patients , regarding their proliferation and interleukin ( IL ) -2 production , as well as the effect of these SSRIs on a murine Langerhans ' cell-like line ( XS52 ) , regarding its IL-1beta production . Serotonin-positive platelets were increased in the inflamed skin compared with control skin . A decrease ( p < 0.01 ) in 5-HT1AR-positive mononuclear cells was evident in the eczematous skin compared with control skin , whereas 5-HT2AR- and P31645 -positive cells were increased ( p < 0.001 for both ) in the eczematous skin . Treatment of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 5x10(-5) mol/l of DOI inhibited ( p < 0.01 ) the proliferation of nickel-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells , while no effect was found regarding P60568 production . DB00215 at 10(-6) mol/l tended to inhibit the production of IL-1beta by the XS52 cell line . These results indicate the implication of the serotonergic system in the contact allergic reaction .
