P10275 controls P00533 and P04626 gene expression at different levels in prostate cancer cell lines . P00533 or P04626 contributes to prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression by activating the androgen receptor ( AR ) in hormone-poor conditions . Here , we investigated the mechanisms by which androgens regulate P00533 and P04626 expression in PCa cells . In steroid-depleted medium ( SDM ) , P00533 protein was less abundant in androgen-sensitive LNCaP than in androgen ablation-resistant 22Rv1 cells , whereas transcript levels were similar . DB02901 ( DB02901 ) treatment increased both P00533 mRNA and protein levels and stimulated RNA polymerase II recruitment to the P00533 gene promoter , whereas it decreased P04626 transcript and protein levels in LNCaP cells . DB02901 altered neither P00533 or P04626 levels nor the abundance of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , TMEPA1 , or O15393 mRNAs in 22Rv1 cells , which express the full-length and a shorter AR isoform deleted from the COOH-terminal domain ( ARDeltaCTD ) . The contribution of both AR isoforms to the expression of these genes was assessed by small interfering RNAs targeting only the full-length or both AR isoforms . Silencing of both isoforms strongly reduced PSA , TMEPA1 , and O15393 transcript levels . Inhibition of both AR isoforms did not affect P00533 and P04626 transcript levels but decreased P00533 and increased P04626 protein levels . Proliferation of 22Rv1 cells in SDM was inhibited in the absence of AR and ARDeltaCTD . A further decrease was obtained with PKI166 , an P00533 / P04626 kinase inhibitor . Overall , we showed that ARDeltaCTD is responsible for constitutive P00533 expression and P04626 repression in 22Rv1 cells and that ARDeltaCTD and tyrosine kinase receptors are necessary for sustained 22Rv1 cell growth .
