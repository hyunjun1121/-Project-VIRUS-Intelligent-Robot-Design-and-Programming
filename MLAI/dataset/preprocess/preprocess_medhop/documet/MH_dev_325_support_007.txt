The effect of cytokine profiles on the viral response to re-treatment in antiviral-experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection . BACKGROUND : There have been few studies on the potential immunological factors associated with viral controls in antiviral-experienced patients on a second round of combination therapy . In this study , we evaluated the level of systemic cytokines and potential impact on combination therapy in both antiviral-naïve and -experienced patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus . METHODS : Longitudinal analysis of 27 cytokines and chemokines was performed using the multiplex Biorad 27 plex assay in 37 antiviral-naïve and 24 experienced chronically HCV-1b-infected patients during combination therapy with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin . A group of healthy donors was included as the control ( n=11 ) . RESULTS : Fifty percent of antiviral-experienced chronically HCV-patients could achieve a delayed and slow virologic response after 48 weeks combination therapy , comparing with an early and fast virologic response in antiviral-naïve patients . A distinction of immune mediators profiling before and during antiviral therapy between antiviral-naïve and -experienced patients was identified , P05112 , IFN-γ and DB00833 -3 ( MIP-1a ) were significantly higher in naïve patients than those in experienced patients ( P=0.005 , 0.047 and 0.017 , respectively ) while G- P04141 in naïve was lower than in experienced patients ( P < 0.05 ) . Notably , higher Th1 type cytokine IFN-γ and lower Th2 type cytokine P05112 at baseline and week 4 were associated with HCV clearance in naïve patients , and a similar trend appeared at week 12 in experienced patients . CONCLUSIONS : We found a successful second round therapy in antiviral-experienced patients appears to be associated with the host immune response . Dominant Th1-polar cytokines , especially IFN-γ , is a potential predictor of viral responsiveness .
