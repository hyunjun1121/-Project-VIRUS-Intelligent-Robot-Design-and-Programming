An essential role of the CAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha in the vitamin D-induced expression of the human steroid/bile acid-sulfotransferase ( Q06520 ) . The vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) regulates steroid and drug metabolism by inducing the genes encoding phase I and phase II enzymes . Q06520 is a liver- and intestine-expressed sulfo-conjugating enzyme that converts the alcohol-OH of neutral steroids , bile acids , and drugs to water-soluble sulfated metabolites . DB00136 [ 1,25-(OH)2D3 ] induces Q06520 gene transcription after the recruitment of P11473 to the vitamin D-responsive chromatin region of Q06520 . A composite element in human Q06520 directs the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated induction of natural and heterologous promoters . This element combines a P11473 /retinoid X receptor-alpha-binding site [ vitamin D response element ( VDRE ) ] , which is an imperfect inverted repeat 2 of AGCTCA , and a CAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding site located 9 bp downstream to VDRE . The binding sites were identified by EMSA , antibody supershift , and deoxyribonuclease I footprinting . C/EBP-alpha at the composite element plays an essential role in the P11473 regulation of Q06520 , because 1 ) induction was lost for promoters with inactivating mutations at the VDRE or C/EBP element ; 2 ) Q06520 induction by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in C/EBP-alpha-deficient cells required the expression of cotransfected C/EBP-alpha ; and 3 ) C/EBP-beta did not substitute for C/EBP-alpha in this regulation . P11473 and C/EBP-alpha were recruited concurrently to the composite element along with the coactivators p300 , steroid receptor coactivator 1 ( Q15788 ) , and P12931 -2 , but not Q9Y6Q9 . P11473 and C/EBP-alpha associated endogenously as a DNA-dependent , coimmunoprecipitable complex , which was detected at a markedly higher level in 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells . These results provide the first example of the essential role of the interaction in cis between C/EBP-alpha and P11473 in directing 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced expression of a P11473 target gene .
