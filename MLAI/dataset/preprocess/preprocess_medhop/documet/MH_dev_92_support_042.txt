A novel O43772 splicing mutation in patients of different ethnic origin with neonatally lethal carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase ( O43772 ) deficiency . DB00583 -acylcarnitine translocase ( O43772 ) deficiency is a rare disorder of fatty acid oxidation associated with high mortality . Two female newborns of different ethnic origin ( the first Anglo-Celtic and the second Palestinian Arab ) both died after sudden collapse on day 2 of life . Both had elevated bloodspot long-chain acylcarnitines consistent with either O43772 or carnitine palmitoyltransferase II ( P23786 ) deficiency ; the latter was excluded by demonstrating normal P23786 activity in fibroblasts . Direct sequencing of all O43772 ( O43772 ) gene exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed that Patient 1 was compound heterozygous for a novel c.609-3c > g ( IVS6-3c > g ) mutation on the paternal allele and a previously described c.326delG mutation on the maternal allele . Patient 2 was homozygous for the same , novel c.609-3c > g mutation . Previously reported O43772 mutations have been almost exclusively confined to a single family or ethnic group . Analysis of fibroblast cDNA by RT-PCR , agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing of extracted bands showed that both mutations produce aberrant splicing . c.609-3C > G results in exon 7 skipping leading to a frameshift with premature termination seven amino acids downstream . c.326delG was confirmed to produce skipping of exons 3 or 3 plus 4 . O43772 activity in both patients ' fibroblasts was near-zero . For both families , prenatal diagnosis of an unaffected fetus was performed by mutation analysis on CVS tissue in a subsequent pregnancy . Due to the urgency of prenatal diagnosis in the second family , molecular diagnosis was performed prior to demonstration of O43772 enzyme deficiency , illustrating that mutation analysis is a rapid and reliable approach to first-line diagnosis of O43772 deficiency .
