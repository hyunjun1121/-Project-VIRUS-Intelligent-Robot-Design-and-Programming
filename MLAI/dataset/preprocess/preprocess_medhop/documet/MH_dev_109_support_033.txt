Genetic aspects of ischemic stroke : coagulation , homocysteine , and lipoprotein metabolism as potential risk factors . Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and long term disability throughout the world . It may be the outcome of a number of monogenic disorders or , more commonly , a polygenic multifactorial disease . Numerous studies have investigated the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke , with varied and often contradictory results . The candidate ' stroke risk ' genes affecting haemostasis ( P12259 , F2 , P02671 / P02675 , P08709 , P00488 , P04275 , P00748 , P05121 , P05106 / P08514 , P17301 , P07359 , TPA , Q96IY4 , P07204 , PZ , P08758 ) , homocysteine metabolism ( P42898 , P35520 , Q99707 ) , and lipid metabolism ( apo E , P06858 , P11597 , O95477 , apo AI , apo CIII , apo AIV , apo AV , apo B , apo H , apo(a) , P27169 /2/3 , P01130 / P78380 ) are evaluated in this review . By examining meta-analyses and case-control studies , we made a classification of gene/gene polymorphisms according to the degree of association with ischemic stroke risk . The data assembled could be very useful for further meta-analysis and for future clinical applications .
