Poly( DB02059 )polymerase-1 signalling of the DNA damage induced by P11387 poison in D54(p53wt) and U251(p53mut) glioblastoma cell lines . Glioblastomas are widely characterised by the mutation of the p53 gene and p53 disruption sensitizes glioblastoma cells to P11387 ( TOPO I ) inhibitor-mediated apoptosis . We investigated the effects of combined treatments with the P11387 inhibitor DB01030 and the poly( DB02059 )polymerase-1 inhibitor DB02690 in D54(p53wt) and U251(p53mut) glioblastoma cell lines . Analysis of cell growth and cell cycle kinetics showed a synergistic anti-proliferative effect of 10 nM TPT and 10 microM DB02690 and a G2/M block of the cell cycle . We also evaluated , the influence of TPT+/- DB02690 treatment on P09874 and p53 activity . We got evidences of a TPT-dependent increase of P09874 auto-modification level in both the cells . Moreover , in the D54(p53wt) cells we found that in co-treatments DB02690 incremented the TPT-dependent stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity and increased the P38936 nuclear amount . Conversely , in U251(p53mut) cells we found that DB02690 incremented the TPT-dependent apoptosis characterised by P09874 proteolysis . Our findings suggest that the modulation of P09874 can be considered a strategy in the potentiation of the chemotherapeutic action of TOPO I poisons in glioblastoma cells apart from their p53 status .
