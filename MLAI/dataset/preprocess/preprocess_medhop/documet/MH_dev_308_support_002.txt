Differential changes of corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) concentrations in plasma and synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB01285 releasing hormone ( P06850 ) and DB01285 concentrations in plasma and P06850 and P05231 concentrations in synovial fluid in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) were examined to clarify the relationship between cytokines and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( Q9Y251 axis ) . Concentrations of serum amyloid A protein ( P0DJI8 ) , one of the acute phase proteins , were also measured as an indicator of inflammation . P06850 and P05231 concentrations in synovial fluid were higher in RA patients than in control patients ( osteoarthritis , OA ) . Plasma DB01285 and P06850 levels were significantly lower in RA patients than in OA patients . This suggests that P06850 secretion in synovial fluid is regulated differently from plasma P06850 secretion , as P06850 levels in synovial fluid and plasma showed opposite changes in RA patients . P0DJI8 levels were positively correlated with the levels of P06850 or P05231 in synovial fluid , whereas there was no correlation between P06850 and P05231 levels . The results suggest that P06850 and P05231 play important independent roles in producing P0DJI8 in synovial fluid .
