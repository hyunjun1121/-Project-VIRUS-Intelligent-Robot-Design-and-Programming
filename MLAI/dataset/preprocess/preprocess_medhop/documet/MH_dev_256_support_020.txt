5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor regulates cell-cycle progression : cross-talk with tyrosine kinase pathways . In this paper , we present evidence that activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B ( P41595 ) receptors by serotonin ( 5-HT ) leads to cell-cycle progression through retinoblastoma protein hyperphosphorylation and through activation of both cyclin D1/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 kinases by a mechanism that depends on induction of cyclin D1 and cyclin E protein levels . The induction of cyclin D1 expression , but not that of cyclin E , is under mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) control , indicating an independent regulation of these two cyclins in the P41595 receptor mitogenesis . Moreover , by using the specific platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) inhibitor AG 1296 or by overexpressing a kinase-mutant P09619 , we show that P09619 kinase activity is essential for P41595 -triggered MAPK/cyclin D1 , but not cyclin E , signaling pathways . P41595 receptor activation also increases activity of the Src family kinase , c-Src , Fyn , and c-Yes . Strikingly , c-Src , but not Fyn or c-Yes , is the crucial molecule between the G(q) protein-coupled P41595 receptor and the cell-cycle regulators . Inhibition of c-Src activity by 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ( P50391 ) or depletion of c-Src is sufficient to abolish the 5-HT-induced ( i ) P09619 tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and MAPK activation , ( ii ) cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression levels , and ( iii ) thymidine incorporation . This paper elucidates a model of P41595 receptor mitogenesis in which c-Src acts alone to control cyclin E induction and in concert with the receptor tyrosine kinase P09619 to induce cyclin D1 expression via the MAPK/ P29323 pathway .
