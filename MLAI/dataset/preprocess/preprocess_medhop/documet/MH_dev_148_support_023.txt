Genetic contributions to labor pain and progress . Studies on genetic contributions to labor analgesia have essentially evaluated the μ-opioid receptor gene ( P35372 ) , with some evidence that p.118A/G of P35372 influences the response to neuraxial opioids . As for labor progress , the β2-adrenergic receptor gene ( P07550 ) is associated with preterm labor and delivery , and impacts the course of labor . Taken together though , there is no evidence that pharmacogenetic testing is needed or beneficial in the context of obstetric anesthesia ; however , realizing the influence of genetic variants on specific phenotypes provides the rationale for a more cautious interpretation of clinical studies that attempt to find a dose-regimen that fits all .
