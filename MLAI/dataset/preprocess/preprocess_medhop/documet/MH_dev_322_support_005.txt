Molecular events caused by mechanical stress in bone . The shape of bone changes as a result of bone remodeling corresponding to physical circumstances such as mechanical stress . The tissue which receives the loaded mechanical stress most efficiently is bone matrix . Recent studies revealed the function of osteocytes as mechanosensors in the early stage of bone remodeling . Loaded mechanical stress is converted to a series of biochemical reactions , and finally activates osteoclasts and osteoblasts to cause bone resorption and formation . Biochemical and molecular biological studies have recently resulted in the identification of the gene of which expression level is changed by mechanical stress . DB00435 ( NO ) and DB02527 is secreted in response to mechanical stress in the immediate early stage . Genes encoding enzymes such as glutamate/aspartate transporter ( P43003 ) , nitric oxide synthetase ( NOS ) and prostaglandin G/H synthetase ( P35354 ) are identified as mechanical stress-responsive . The expression level of P05019 is enhanced under the control of PTH/ P12272 . The expression of c-fos is increased by loading of mechanical stress . P05412 , a heterodimer of c- P01100 /c- P05412 , functions as a transcription factor of downstream gene(s) . Elements including P05412 sites , cyclic AMP response elements ( CRE ) and shear stress response elements ( SSRE ) are found in the promoter region of mechanical stress-response genes . The enhanced expression of osteopontin ( P10451 ) in the osteocytes of bone resorption sites was demonstrated by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry and transdifferentiation of chondrocytes with the abundant expression of P12643 and -4 in the process of distraction osteogenesis was observed .
