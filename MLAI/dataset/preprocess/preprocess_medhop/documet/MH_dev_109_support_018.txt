Contribution of platelets and the vessel wall to the antithrombotic effects of a single bolus injection of Fab fragments of the antiplatelet P08514 /IIIa antibody 7E3 in a canine arterial eversion graft preparation . The contribution of platelets and the vessel wall to the antithrombotic effects of a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.8 mg/kg Fab fragments of the monoclonal antiplatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antibody DB00054 ( 7E3-Fab ) , combined with continuous heparin anticoagulation ( 100 U/kg bolus and 50 U/kg per hour ) , was studied in a canine preparation consisting of an everted ( inside out ) carotid arterial segment that had been inserted into a transected femoral artery . In all 6 control dogs without antibody , persistent or transient eversion graft occlusion occurred during an initial 2-hour observation period , and 5 of the 6 grafts were occluded at 24 hours . In 6 dogs given 7E3-Fab 24 hours before receiving an everted carotid artery segment from a donor dog , cyclic occlusion and reflow occurred in all dogs , whereas the grafts were patent at the end of a 2-hour observation period in 5 of the 6 dogs ( P = .056 versus control ) . When transferred back to the donor dogs , the patient eversion segments showed brief periods of cyclic occlusion and reflow within 2 hours in 3 of 5 dogs ( P = .034 versus control ) , whereas all of the 5 eversion segments were patent at 24 hours ( P < .005 versus control ) .
