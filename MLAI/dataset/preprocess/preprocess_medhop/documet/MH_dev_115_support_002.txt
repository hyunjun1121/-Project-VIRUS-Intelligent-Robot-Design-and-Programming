DB08877 for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis . PURPOSE : The pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , pharmacogenomics , clinical efficacy , and safety profile of ruxolitinib for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis are reviewed . SUMMARY : DB08877 , an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Janus-associated kinases ( JAKs ) 1 and 2 , has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis . Unlike previous treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis , ruxolitinib offers a targeted therapy option for these patients who often suffer with severe and debilitating symptoms associated with the disease process . After oral administration , ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed and can be given without regard to meals . DB08877 is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) 3A4 isoenzyme system ; therefore , if concomitant use with a strong P08684 inhibitor is unavoidable , an initial dosage reduction is warranted . Two Phase III randomized trials comparing ruxolitinib to either placebo or best available therapy found a rapid and sustained response in the reduction of spleen size and improvements in constitutional symptoms and quality of life , with one study demonstrating an improvement in overall survival . The most commonly reported serious adverse effects of ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia . DB08877 is administered as an oral tablet given twice daily , with the initial starting dosage based on the baseline platelet count . Dosage reductions are based on the development of thrombocytopenia . CONCLUSION : By directly targeting both P23458 and O60674 through small-molecule inhibition , ruxolitinib elicits a reduction in splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile and a low treatment-discontinuation rate .
