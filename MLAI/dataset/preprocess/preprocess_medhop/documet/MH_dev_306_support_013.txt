The receptor for urokinase regulates O60603 mediated inflammatory responses in neutrophils . The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( P06744 ) anchored membrane protein , regulates urokinase ( uPA ) protease activity , chemotaxis , cell-cell interactions , and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells . Q03405 expression is increased in cytokine or bacteria activated cell populations , including macrophages and monocytes . However , it is unclear if Q03405 has direct involvement in the response of inflammatory cells , such as neutrophils and macrophages , to Toll like receptor ( TLR ) stimulation . In this study , we found that Q03405 is required for optimal neutrophil activation after O60603 , but not O00206 stimulation . We found that the expression of P01375 -α and P05231 induced by O60603 engagement in Q03405 -/- neutrophils was less than that in Q03405 +/+ ( WT ) neutrophils . Pretreatment of neutrophils with PI- P98160 , which cleaves P06744 moieties , significantly decreased O60603 induced expression of P01375 -α in WT neutrophils , but demonstrated only marginal effects on P01375 -α expression in PAM treated Q03405 -/- neutrophils . IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation were not different in Q03405 -/- or WT neutrophils after O60603 stimulation . However , Q03405 is required for optimal p38 MAPK activation after O60603 engagement . Consistent with the in vitro findings that Q03405 modulates O60603 engagement induced neutrophil activation , we found that pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by O60603 , but not O00206 stimulation is reduced in Q03405 -/- mice compared to WT counterparts . Therefore , our data suggest that neutrophil associated Q03405 could be a potential target for treating acute inflammation , sepsis , and organ injury related to severe bacterial and other microbial infections in which O60603 engagement plays a major role .
