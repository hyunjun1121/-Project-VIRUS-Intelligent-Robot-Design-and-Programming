Somatostatin receptor subtype-dependent regulation of nitric oxide release : involvement of different intracellular pathways . We reported previously that , in addition to direct effects , somatostatin ( P61278 ) affects tumor growth inhibiting the tumoral neoangiogenesis , via an interference with NO synthesis . Here , we analyzed the effects of P61278 on nitric oxide ( NO ) production induced by different agonists [ basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , insulin , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) ] and the intracellular signaling involved , using Chinese hamster ovary-k1 cells stably transfected with individual P30872 - P31391 . P09038 and insulin induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity via the generation of ceramide or the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , respectively . CCK regulates neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity in a Ca++-dependent manner . P61278 inhibited NO production stimulated by P09038 through P61278 receptor 1 ( P30872 ) , P30874 , and P32745 and by CCK through P30874 and P32745 . In all the cell lines , P61278 treatment did not modify NO synthesis induced by insulin . P31391 activation was not effective on any of the stimuli tested . The effects on P09038 -induced NO production were downstream from receptor phosphorylation and ceramide synthesis . P30874 and -3 on CCK activity were related to the inhibition of intracellular Ca++ mobilization , whereas the lack of effects on insulin was paralleled by the absence of P61278 activity on Akt phosphorylation . These data , identifying for the first time a selective receptor subtype-inhibitory role of P61278 on NO generation , may open new perspectives in the use of P61278 agonists to control tumoral angiogenesis .
