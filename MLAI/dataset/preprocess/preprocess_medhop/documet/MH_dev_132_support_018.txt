Abeta(1-40)-induced secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 results in sAPPalpha release by association with cell surface P05067 . To understand matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) involvement in Alzheimer 's disease , we examined mechanisms mediating increased expression of P14780 in the presence of Abeta(1-40) and the role of P14780 on amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) processing . Up-regulation of P14780 expressed by SK-N-SH cells in the presence of Abeta(1-40) was mediated by alpha(3)beta(1) and alpha(2)beta(1) integrin receptors . Overexpression of P14780 or treatment of P29320 /APP695 cells with activated recombinant P14780 resulted in enhanced secretion of soluble P05067 ( sAPPalpha ) , a product of alpha-secretase cleavage , and reduction of Abeta release . P14780 effect was enhanced by phorbol 12-mysistrate-13-acetate ( PMA ) , an alpha-secretase activator and inhibited by DB00974 or SB-3CT , an P14780 inhibitor . Additionally , immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that P14780 and APP695 were associated on the cell surface . These results indicate that Abeta peptide increases P14780 secretion through integrins ; P14780 then directly processes cell surface APP695 with an alpha-secretase like activity , substantially reducing the levels of secreted Abeta peptide .
