Dietary L-carnitine supplementation increases lipid deposition in the liver and muscle of yellow catfish ( Pelteobagrus fulvidraco ) through changes in lipid metabolism . DB00583 has been reported to improve growth performance and reduce body lipid content in fish . Thus , we hypothesised that carnitine supplementation can improve growth performance and reduce lipid content in the liver and muscle of yellow catfish ( Pelteobagrus fulvidraco ) , a commonly cultured freshwater fish in inland China , and tested this hypothesis in the present study . Diets containing l-carnitine at three different concentrations of 47 mg/kg ( control , without extra carnitine addition ) , 331 mg/kg ( low carnitine ) and 3495 mg/kg ( high carnitine ) diet were fed to yellow catfish for 8 weeks . The low-carnitine diet significantly improved weight gain ( WG ) and reduced the feed conversion ratio ( FCR ) . In contrast , the high-carnitine diet did not affect WG and FCR . Compared with the control diet , the low-carnitine and high-carnitine diets increased lipid and carnitine contents in the liver and muscle . The increased lipid content in the liver could be attributed to the up-regulation of the mRNA levels of SREBP , PPARÎ³ , fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) and ACCa and the increased activities of lipogenic enzymes ( such as FAS , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme ) and to the down-regulation of the mRNA levels of the lipolytic gene P50416 . The increased lipid content in muscle could be attributed to the down-regulation of the mRNA levels of the lipolytic genes P50416 and Q96AD5 and the increased activity of lipoprotein lipase . In conclusion , in contrast to our hypothesis , dietary carnitine supplementation increased body lipid content in yellow catfish .
