DB00005 for the treatment of psoriasis : combination therapy with other modalities . DB00005 is a self-administered medication that has FDA approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , and ankylosing spondylitis . DB00005 is a human fusion protein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) and the Fc region of IgG1 that binds to and presumably inhibits the pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative activity of the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) . A recent multisite , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study conclusively demonstrates that etanercept as monotherapy effectively treats patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis . This effect is dose-responsive , with the etanercept 50 mg twice-weekly dose significantly more effective than the 25 mg twice-weekly dose in reducing the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score over both 12 and 24 weeks of continuous therapy . Nevertheless , clinical trials do not instruct the dermatologist on how to practically integrate etanercept into a patient 's pre-existing treatment regimen . Many psoriasis patients are already on other systemic therapies or have a medical history that necessitates a tailored approach to their therapy . Further , in some patients , etanercept at 25 mg twice weekly is ineffective in maximally clearing a patient of psoriasis . Below are cases that demonstrate how etanercept can be combined with other medications in order to both maximize clinical efficacy and minimize potential risk .
