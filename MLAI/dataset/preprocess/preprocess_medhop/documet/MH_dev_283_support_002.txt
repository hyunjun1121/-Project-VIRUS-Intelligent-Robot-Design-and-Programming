Determination of the dose of agomelatine , a melatoninergic agonist and selective 5-HT(2C) antagonist , in the treatment of major depressive disorder : a placebo-controlled dose range study . DB06594 ( S 20098 ) has a unique and new pharmacological profile . It is a melatoninergic agonist and selective antagonist of P28335 receptors , and has been shown to be active in several animal models of depression . The aim of this study was to determine the active dose of agomelatine in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV criteria ) . The methodology used was a conventional double-blind design comparing three different doses of agomelatine ( 1 , 5 and 25 mg once a day ) with placebo over an 8-week treatment period . Paroxetine was used as the study validator . Seven hundred and eleven patients with a baseline mean score of 27.4 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) were included . On the pivotal analysis , the mean final HAM-D total score ( Q8N1N2 Analysis Set LOCF ) demonstrated agomelatine 25 mg to be statistically more effective than placebo . This was confirmed by other analyses and criteria ( responders , remission , subpopulation of severely depressed patients , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness ) . DB06594 25 mg alleviated the anxiety associated with depression , as measured on Hamilton Anxiety Scale . Paroxetine was found to be effective on pivotal analysis and most of the secondary criteria used to validate the study methodology and population . DB06594 , whatever the dose , showed good acceptability with a side-effects profile close to that of placebo . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that agomelatine is efficient in the treatment of major depressive disorder and that 25 mg is the target dose .
