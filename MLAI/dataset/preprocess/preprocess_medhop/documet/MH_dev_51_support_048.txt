Growth of V79 cells as xenograft tumors promotes multicellular resistance but does not increase spontaneous or radiation-induced mutant frequency . A Chinese hamster V79 xenograft model was developed to determine whether cells subjected to a hypoxic tumor microenvironment would be more likely to undergo mutation at the P00492 locus . V79-171b cells stably transfected with P15692 and EGFP were grown subcutaneously in immunodeficient NOD/ SCID mice . V79-VE tumors were characterized for host cell infiltration , doubling time , hypoxic fraction , vascular perfusion , and response to ionizing radiation . When irradiated in vitro , the mutant frequency for a given surviving fraction did not differ for cells grown in vivo or in vitro . Similar results were obtained using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells grown as xenografts . However , V79-VE cells grown as xenografts were significantly more resistant to killing than monolayers . The background mutant frequency and the radiation-induced mutant frequency did not differ for tumor cells close to or distant from blood vessels . Similarly , tumor cells from well-perfused regions showed the same rate of strand break rejoining and the same rate of loss of phosphorylated histone P16104 as cells sorted from poorly perfused regions . Therefore , deleterious effects of the tumor microenvironment on DNA repair efficiency or mutation induction could not be demonstrated in these tumors . Rather , development of multicellular resistance in V79-VE tumors acted to reduce mutant frequency for a given dose of radiation .
