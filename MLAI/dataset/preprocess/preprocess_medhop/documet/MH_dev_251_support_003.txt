Inhibitors of P11274 signalling interrupt the survival signal mediated by the micro-environment in mantle cell lymphoma . Several studies provide evidences for mantle cell lymphoma ( Q8WXI8 ) cell survival relying on B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) -mediated signalling pathways , whereas the nature of this activation is unknown . Significant progress in Q8WXI8 treatment is achieved through therapies targeting P11274 -associated kinases , i.e. , DB09053 and Fostamatinib , inhibitors of Q06187 and P43405 , respectively . Our study addresses survival signals emanating from the P11274 or the tumour environment and how inhibiting P11274 signalling effectors might impact these survival signals . We found that Q06187 was constitutively activated and that P43405 phosphorylation was highly increased and sustained upon P11274 activation of primary Q8WXI8 cells . Moreover , Q8WXI8 cells from leukaemic patients secreted high amount of IL-1β , P05231 , P10145 and P13501 . Activation of the P11274 induced ( i ) cell survival , ( ii ) P40763 activation and ( iii ) increased autocrine secretion of IL-1β , P05231 , P10145 , P13501 , P22301 , TNFα and P15692 . Specific inhibition of Q06187 by DB09053 or P43405 by Fostamatinib ( R406 ) reversed these protective effects and decreased both basal and P11274 -induced autocrine cytokine secretions associated with P40763 phosphorylation . Interestingly , targeting Q06187 and P43405 prevented and inhibited P11274 -induced Q8WXI8 cell adhesion to human bone marrow stromal cells ( HMSCs ) in short- and long-term co-culture . We demonstrated that P11274 -induced survival relies on autocrine secretion of IL-1β , TNFα and P13501 that might facilitate adhesion of Q8WXI8 cells to HMSC . Treatment with DB09053 or Fostamatinib blocked the chemotactic signal thus increasing apoptosis .
