p38 Q96HU1 kinase regulates stem cell apoptosis in human hematopoietic failure . Myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) are clonal stem cell disorders that lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and are common causes of low blood counts in the elderly . The exact molecular mechanisms regulating increased stem apoptosis in these disorders are not well defined . p38 MAPK activation is important in regulating the growth inhibitory signals of P01375 , TGF-beta and Interferons on human hematopoiesis . Our findings show that p38 MAPK is overactivated in myelodysplasia bone marrows and regulates hematopoietic stem cell apoptosis . Inhibition of p38 MAPK by genetic or pharmacologic means decreases apoptosis and stimulates in vitro hematopoiesis from primary P43034 hematopoietic progenitors . These studies point to the potential efficacy of selective p38alpha inhibitor , DB05412 , in human bone marrow failure .
