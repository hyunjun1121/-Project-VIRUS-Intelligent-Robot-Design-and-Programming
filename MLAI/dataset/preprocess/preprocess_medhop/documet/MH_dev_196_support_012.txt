DB00107 improves mentalizing - pronounced effects for individuals with attenuated ability to empathize . The ability to predict the behavior of others based on their mental states is crucial for social functioning . Previous studies have provided evidence for the role of DB00107 ( P01178 ) in enhancing the ability to mentalize . It has also been demonstrated that the effect of P01178 seems to strongly depend on socio-cognitive skills with more pronounced effects in individuals with lower socio-cognitive skills . Although recent studies indicate that mentalizing is related to empathy , no study has yet examined whether the effects of P01178 on mentalizing depend on the ability to empathize . 71 male participants participated in a double-blind , between-subjects , placebo-controlled experiment . The Reading the Mind in the Eye Test ( RMET ) was used to investigate mentalizing abilities . We analyzed the effect of P01178 on easy and difficult items of the RMET depending on differential empathy scores of the participants as assessed with the Empathy Quotient ( EQ ) . Our results showed that P01178 improves mentalizing for difficult but not for easy items . We generally observed increased mentalizing accuracy in participants with higher empathy scores . Importantly , however , whereas the performance in participants with higher empathy scores was comparable in both P01178 and placebo condition , P01178 specifically enhanced mentalizing accuracy in participants with lower empathy scores . Our findings suggest that P01178 enhances mentalizing abilities . However , we also demonstrate that not all participants benefited from P01178 application . It seems that the effects of P01178 strongly depend on baseline social-cognitive skills such as empathy .
