P26441 and interleukin-6 differentially activate microglia . Studies have shown that cytokines released following CNS injury can affect the supportive or cytotoxic functions of microglia . P05231 ( P05231 ) -family cytokines are among the injury factors released . To understand how microglia respond to P05231 family cytokines , we examined the effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor ( P26441 ) and P05231 on primary cultures of rat microglia . To assess the functional state of the cells , we assayed the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) , and cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) following stimulation . We show that P26441 reduces P35354 levels , whereas P05231 increases the expression of IL-1beta , TNFalpha , and Cox-2 . We also examined trophic factor expression and found that P26441 enhances glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor ( P39905 ) mRNA and protein secretion , whereas P05231 has no effect . Correspondingly , conditioned media from P26441 -stimulated microglia promote motor neuron survival threefold beyond controls , whereas P05231 -stimulated microglia decrease neuronal survival twofold . To understand better the signaling mechanisms responsible for the opposite responses of these P05231 -family cytokines , we examined P35610 -3 and P29323 phosphorylation in P26441 - and P05231 -stimulated microglia . P05231 markedly increases P35610 -3 and P29323 phosphorylation after 20 min of treatment , whereas these signal transducers are weakly stimulated by P26441 across a range of doses . We conclude that P26441 modifies microglial activation to support neuronal survival and that P05231 enhances their capacity to do harm , as a result of different modes of intracellular signaling .
