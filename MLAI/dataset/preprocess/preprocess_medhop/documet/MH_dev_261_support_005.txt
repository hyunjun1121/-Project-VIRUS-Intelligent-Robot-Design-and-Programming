Isolation and characterization of P62333 . A novel ATPase family component of the yeast 26 S proteasome . Using a genetic strategy designed to find proteins involved in the function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activator GAL4 , we isolated mutants in two genes which rescue a class of gal4 activation domain mutants . One of these genes , P62195 , encodes a member of a large family of putative ATPases , the Conserved ATPase containing Domain ( CAD ) proteins ( also known as AAA proteins ) that are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions . Subsequently , P62195 was identified as a subunit of the 26 S proteasome . We have now cloned the gene defined by the second complementation group . P62333 encodes an essential 49-kDa protein that is also a member of the CAD family and is 43 % identical to P62195 . The mutation in sug2-1 , like that in sug1-1 , is found in the CAD near the highly conserved ATPase motif . We present biochemical and genetic evidence that P62333 is associated in vivo with P62195 and is a novel P27708 subunit of the 26 S proteasome . With its highly conserved mammalian homologs , human Q8NFH3 and ground squirrel CADp44 , P62333 defines a new class of proteasomal CAD proteins .
