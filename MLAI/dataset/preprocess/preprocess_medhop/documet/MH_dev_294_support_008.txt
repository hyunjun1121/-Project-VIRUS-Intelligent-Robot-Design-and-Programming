Peripherally administered P06850 suppresses the vocalizations of isolated guinea pig pups . In Experiment 1 , an SC injection of 14 micrograms P06850 greatly suppressed the vocalizing of isolated guinea pig pups 1 h later and produced highly elevated plasma cortisol levels . In Experiment 2 , SC injection of 18 international units of DB01285 produced similar cortisol elevations , but had a negligible effect on vocalizations . In Experiment 3 , the minimum effective dose of P06850 for suppressing vocalizations was found to be about 7 micrograms . This dose also suppressed locomotor activity and produced cortisol elevations that were as great as those produced by the 14 micrograms dose . In Experiment 4 , suppression of vocalizations by P06850 was not reversed by 1 or 5 mg/kg body weight of naloxone . Rectal temperature was unaffected by P06850 or naloxone . Thus , peripheral administration of P06850 has a suppressive effect on the vocalizations of isolated guinea pig pups . The effect is accompanied by a reduction in locomotor activity and does not appear to be mediated by DB01285 , cortisol , beta-endorphin , or an altered body temperature response to the isolation procedure . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased secretion of P06850 contributes to the waning of the vocalizations of guinea pig pups during prolonged isolation .
