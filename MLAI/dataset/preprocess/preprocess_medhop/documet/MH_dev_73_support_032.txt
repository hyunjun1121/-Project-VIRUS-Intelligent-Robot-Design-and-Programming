Adolescent exposure to chronic DB00470 blocks opiate dependence in maternally deprived rats . Maternal deprivation in rats specifically leads to a vulnerability to opiate dependence . However , the impact of cannabis exposure during adolescence on this opiate vulnerability has not been investigated . Chronic dronabinol ( natural delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol , THC ) exposure during postnatal days 35-49 was made in maternal deprived ( D ) or non-deprived ( animal facility rearing , AFR ) rats . The effects of dronabinol exposure were studied after 2 weeks of washout on the rewarding effects of morphine measured in the place preference and oral self-administration tests . The preproenkephalin ( PPE ) mRNA levels and the relative density and functionality of P21554 , and mu-opioid receptors were quantified in the striatum and the mesencephalon . Chronic dronabinol exposure in AFR rats induced an increase in sensitivity to morphine conditioning in the place preference paradigm together with a decrease of PPE mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens and the caudate-putamen nucleus , without any modification for preference to oral morphine consumption . In contrast , dronabinol treatment on D-rats normalized PPE decrease in the striatum , morphine consumption , and suppressed sensitivity to morphine conditioning . P21554 and mu-opioid receptor density and functionality were not changed in the striatum and mesencephalon of all groups of rats . These results indicate THC potency to act as a homeostatic modifier that would worsen the reward effects of morphine on naive animals , but ameliorate the deficits in maternally D-rats . These findings point to the self-medication use of cannabis in subgroups of individuals subjected to adverse postnatal environment .
