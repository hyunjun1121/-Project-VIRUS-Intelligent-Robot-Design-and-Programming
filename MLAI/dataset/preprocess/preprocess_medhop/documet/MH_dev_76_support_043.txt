Clinical utilization of cinacalcet in hypercalcemic conditions . INTRODUCTION : DB01012 has recently been introduced as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients and for parathyroid carcinoma . However , there has been an increasing interest in finding out whether cinacalcet can be used as a treatment for other parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) -dependent hypercalcemic conditions also . AREAS COVERED : The article reports the most relevant recent contributions dealing with calcium sensing receptor ( P41180 ) physiology as well as cinacalcet pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics . It also looks at the different hypercalcemic conditions where the use of cinacalcet has been proposed . This article was researched using clinical trials , case reports and outstanding basic research published in the last 3 years ( MEDLINE database up to 31 November 2010 ) . It provides the reader with an insight into the many unaddressed issues regarding cinacalcet that need to be resolved before it can be used in newly proposed fields . EXPERT OPINION : Since cinacalcet may not only have an effect on parathyroid P41180 but also on P41180 expressed at bone and renal levels , it can currently only be considered a good alternative to parathyroidectomy in PTH-dependent hypercalcemic conditions when surgical intervention is burdened by a high failure rate or when it can be considered a risky procedure . At present , cinacalcet can not be considered the first choice treatment in asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism or in mild-to-moderate forms of familial hypocalciuric hypocalcemia .
