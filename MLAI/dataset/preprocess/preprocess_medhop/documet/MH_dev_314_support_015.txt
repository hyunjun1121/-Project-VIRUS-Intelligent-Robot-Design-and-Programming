Mislocalization of cell-cell adhesion complexes in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells with elevated c-Src tyrosine kinase activity . c-Src activation has been implicated in metastasis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer . Here we investigated how c-Src activity affects cell adhesion using a tamoxifen-resistant variant of MCF-7 cells ( Q99707 -3 ) containing elevated c-Src activity . In Q99707 -3 cells , adhesion proteins beta-catenin and P12830 are mislocalized , forming novel structures perpendicular to cell-cell junctions . c-Src is associated with beta-catenin/ P12830 complexes and beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation is enhanced . Blocking c-Src tyrosine kinase activity decreased beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and restored localization of beta-catenin and P12830 at cell-cell junctions . These findings suggest that inhibition of c-Src signaling may prevent metastasis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer .
