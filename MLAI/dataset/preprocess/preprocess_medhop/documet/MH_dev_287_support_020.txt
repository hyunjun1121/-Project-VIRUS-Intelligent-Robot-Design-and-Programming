The complex of FK506-binding protein 12 and FK506 inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity and IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts , but not exocytosis , in mouse mast cells . FK506 and cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit P60568 production by activated T cells , but only DB00091 inhibits IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts in mouse P08700 -dependent , bone marrow-derived mast cells ( BMMC ) . We previously associated the resistance of BMMC to FK506 with a deficiency in the expression of FK506 binding protein ( FKBP ) 12 , a molecule that forms a complex with FK506 capable of inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity in vitro . In this report , we establish that P62942 mediates FK506 inhibition of both calcineurin phosphatase activity and IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts in a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cell line that is P62942 deficient . Overexpression of P62942 by transfection enhanced the ability of FK506 to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity ( IC50 = 2 nM ) , compared with cells transfected with the expression vector alone ( IC50 > 30 nM ) . The IC50 value for FK506 inhibition of IgE activation-induced transcripts for P01375 decreased from 40 nM in vector control cells to 10 nM in P62942 transfectants . Similarly , the IC50 value for inhibition of P05231 transcripts decreased from > 1000 nM in vector control cells to 35 nM in P62942 transfectants . In contrast , activation-elicited release of the secretory granule mediator beta-hexosaminidase was only partially inhibited by FK506 at 1000 nM , regardless of the levels of P62942 expressed by the cells . Thus , P62942 is the dominant cytosolic protein that mediates FK506 inhibition of P01375 and P05231 transcripts .
