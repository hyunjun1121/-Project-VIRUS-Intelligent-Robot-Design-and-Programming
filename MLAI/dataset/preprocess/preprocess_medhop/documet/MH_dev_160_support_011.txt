Binding and functional comparisons of two types of tumor necrosis factor antagonists . Two tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists infliximab ( a chimeric monoclonal antibody ) and etanercept ( a p75 P01375 receptor/Fc fusion protein ) have been approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . However , these agents have shown different degrees of clinical benefit in controlled clinical trials in other P01375 -mediated diseases such as Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and psoriasis . We investigated whether structural differences between these two antagonists translate into different binding and functional characteristics . To study the binding of infliximab and etanercept to both the soluble and cell-surface transmembrane forms of P01375 , a variety of in vitro binding and cell-based assays were performed . Binding assays using (125)I-labeled P01375 showed that infliximab binds to both monomer and trimer forms of soluble P01375 ( sTNF ) , whereas etanercept binding is restricted to the trimer form . DB00065 formed stable complexes with sTNF , whereas etanercept formed relatively unstable complexes , resulting in release of dissociated P01375 . KYM-1D4 cell killing assays and human umbilical vein endothelial cell activation assays demonstrated that P01375 that had dissociated from etanercept was bioactive . DB00065 also formed more stable complexes with the transmembrane form of P01375 expressed on transfected cells relative to analogous complexes formed with etanercept . Additionally , more infliximab molecules bound to the transmembrane P01375 with higher avidity than etanercept . Although both infliximab and etanercept inhibited transmembrane P01375 -mediated activation of human endothelial cells , infliximab was significantly more effective . The differences between infliximab and etanercept in their P01375 binding characteristics may help explain their differential efficacy in CD and psoriasis clinical trials .
