Structures of murine carbonic anhydrase IV and human carbonic anhydrase II complexed with brinzolamide : molecular basis of isozyme-drug discrimination . P22748 ( CAIV ) is a membrane-associated enzyme anchored to plasma membrane surfaces by a phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage . We have determined the 2.8-angstroms resolution crystal structure of a truncated , soluble form of recombinant murine CAIV . We have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma therapy , the sulfonamide inhibitor brinzolamide ( DB01194 ) . The overall structure of murine CAIV is generally similar to that of human CAIV ; however , some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid sequence differences in the " 130 's segment " and the residue-63 loop ( these may affect the nearby catalytic proton shuttle , DB00117 -64 ) . Similar to human CAIV , the C-terminus of murine CAIV is surrounded by a substantial electropositive surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane . Binding interactions observed for brinzolamide rationalize the generally weaker affinity of inhibitors used in glaucoma therapy toward CAIV compared with CAII .
