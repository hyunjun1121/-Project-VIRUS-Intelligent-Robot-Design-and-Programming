DB01169 concentration determines the fate of Ewing 's sarcoma family tumors and neuroblastoma cells in vitro . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) induces both the differentiation and apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in a concentration dependent manner . We assessed the effects of As(2)O(3) in CADO-ES Ewing 's sarcoma ( ES ) , JK-GMS peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , as they share common histogenetic backgrounds . As(2)O(3) at low concentrations ( 0.1-1 microM ) induced SH-SY5Y differentiation , and whereas PNET cells acquired a slightly differentiated phenotype , change was minimal in ES cells . P28482 ( P28482 ) was activated at low As(2)O(3) concentrations , and PD98059 , an inhibitor of MEK-1 , blocked SH-SY5Y cell differentiation by As(2)O(3) . High concentrations ( 2-10 microM ) of As(2)O(3) induced the apoptosis in all three cell lines , and this was accompanied by the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase . The generation of H(2)O(2) and activation of caspase 3 were identified as critical components of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in all of the above cell lines . P09038 enhanced As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in JK-GMS cells . The overall effects of As(2)O(3) strongly suggest that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ES/PNET .
