Q9Y6X2 negatively regulates O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis directly in osteoclast precursors and indirectly via osteoblasts . Cytokine signaling via various transcription factors regulates receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) -mediated osteoclast differentiation from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells involved in propagation and resolution of inflammatory bone destruction . Protein inhibitor of activated P40763 ( Q9Y6X2 ) was initially identified as a molecule that inhibits DNA binding of P40763 and regulates many transcription factors through distinct mechanisms . To analyze Q9Y6X2 function in osteoclasts in vivo , we have generated transgenic mice in which Q9Y6X2 is specifically expressed in the osteoclast lineage using the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) gene promoter . Q9Y6X2 transgenic mice showed an osteopetrotic phenotype due to impairment of osteoclast differentiation . Overexpression of Q9Y6X2 in RAW264.7 cells suppressed O14788 -induced osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the expression of c-Fos and O95644 . Interestingly , Q9Y6X2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( O75030 ) independent of sumoylation . Down-regulation of Q9Y6X2 markedly enhances O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells . Furthermore , overexpression of Q9Y6X2 in mouse primary osteoblast ( DB00925 ) , down-regulates O14788 expression induced by interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) cytokine family , and inhibits osteoclast formation from bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) in vitro coculture system . Down-regulation of Q9Y6X2 leads to the accelerated expression of O14788 in DB00925 stimulated with P05231 and soluble P05231 receptor ( sIL-6R ) . Taken together , our results clearly indicate that Q9Y6X2 negatively regulates O14788 -mediated osteoclastogenesis directly in osteoclast precursors and indirectly via osteoblasts .
