KR-31372 inhibits P35968 /Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation via K+( DB00171 ) channel opening in its antiangiogenic effect . The aim of this study was to identify the signaling pathway of the antiangiogenesis by ( 2R,3R,4S ) -N-cyano-N- ( 6-nitro-3,4-dihydro-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-dimethoxymethyl 2H-1-benzopyran-4yl ) -N'-benzylguanidine ( KR-31372 ) . KR-31372 inhibited the in vitro basal tube formation using Matrigel-coated plate and in vivo neovascularizations in mice induced by Matrigel containing vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 (165) , 5 ng/ml ) . P15692 (165) markedly increased cell proliferation using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and chemotactic migration using transwell chamber in human umbilical vein endothelial cells , those of which were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with KR-31372 and levcromakalim concentration dependently . The suppression of all these variables were strongly antagonized by glibenclamide , DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channel blocker . KR-31372 ( 10(-6)-10(-4) M ) and levcromakalim ( 10(-5) M ) concentration-dependently suppressed the P15692 (165)-induced increases in P35968 /Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) , p38 MAK and p125( Q05397 ) tyrosine phosphorylation . These variables were significantly antagonized by glibenclamide . In conclusion , KR-31372 significantly inhibited the P35968 /Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation-linked P27361 /2 , p38 MAPK and p125( Q05397 ) tyrosine phosphorylation via mediation of K(+)( DB00171 ) channel opening , thereby resulting in antiangiogenesis .
