A valuable adjunct to FNA diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma : in-house PCR assay for P15056 T1799A ( V600E ) . The diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules generally starts with FNA cytology . However , approximately one-fifth of cytologic evaluations yield indeterminate cytological findings but only 20 % of cases with indeterminate thyroid nodule cytology have a cancer diagnosis , emphasizing the need for an effective ancillary test based on FNA material to help prevent unnecessary surgery . Detection of BRAFV600E mutation , the genetic signature of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) in FNA material provides an invaluable diagnostic adjunct to overcome the limitations of FNA cytology . There are many ways to detect V600E , such as direct DNA sequencing , allele-specific PCR and hybridization-based colorimetric methods . In this study , a newer simple PCR method is presented that removes requirements for sequencing special equipment and commercial kits . Two forward primers including the mutant sequence specific ( F2 ) , and one common reverse ( R ) primer were optimized to generate a 241 bp fragment ( F1R ) , an internal PCR control , and a 141 bp fragment ( P25116 ) denoting the presence of V600E . Sensitivity studies revealed that the assay is capable of detecting V600E even in 1 ng of DNA . Direct sequencing data of 241 bp F1R fragment proved the specificity of the assay . For validation studies of the sequence specific multiplex PCR assay , archival FNA slides were used in a group of thyroid lesions including PTC , follicular carcinoma , follicular adenoma , Hashimoto thyroiditis , and benign thyroid nodules . The newer PCR-based method presented in this study is a practical , inexpensive one-step assay to detect the P15056 T1796A mutation on FNA samples .
