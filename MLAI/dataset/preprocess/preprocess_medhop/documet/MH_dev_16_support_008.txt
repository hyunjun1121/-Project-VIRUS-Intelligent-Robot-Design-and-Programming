Angiotensin II regulates vascular and endothelial dysfunction : recent topics of P30556 signaling in the vasculature . Accumulating evidence strongly implicates angiotensin II ( AngII ) intracellular signaling in mediating cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension , atherosclerosis and restenosis after vascular injury . In vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) , through its G-protein-coupled AngII Type 1 receptor ( AT(1) ) , AngII activates various intracellular protein kinases , such as receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases , which includes epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) , c-Src , Q14289 , Q05397 , O60674 . In addition , AngII activates serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) family , P08133 S6 kinase , Akt/protein kinase B and various protein kinase C isoforms . In VSMCs , AngII also induces the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which play critical roles in activation and modulation of above signal transduction . Less is known about endothelial cell ( EC ) AngII signaling than VSMCs , however , recent studies suggest that endothelial AngII signaling negatively regulates the nitric oxide ( NO ) signaling pathway and thereby induces endothelial dysfunction . Moreover , in both VSMCs and ECs , AngII signaling cross-talk with insulin signaling might be involved in insulin resistance , an important risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases . In fact , clinical and pharmacological studies showed that AngII infusion induces insulin resistance and AngII converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) receptor blockers improve insulin sensitivity . In this review , we focus on the recent findings that suggest the existence of novel signaling mechanisms whereby AngII mediates processes , such as activation of receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases and ROS , as well as cross-talk between insulin and NO signal transduction in VSMCs and ECs .
