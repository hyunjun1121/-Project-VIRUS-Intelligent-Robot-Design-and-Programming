LSD and DOB : interaction with 5- Q13049 receptors to inhibit DB01221 receptor-mediated transmission in the rat prefrontal cortex . Both the phenethylamine hallucinogen (-)-1-2 , 5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl-2-aminopropane ( DOB ) , a selective serotonin 5- Q13049 ,2C receptor agonist , and the indoleamine hallucinogen DB04829 ( LSD , which binds to P08908 , 1B , 1D , 1E , 1F , 2A , 2C , 5 , 6 , 7 , dopamine D1 and D2 , and alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic receptors ) , but not their non-hallucinogenic congeners , inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) -induced inward current and DB01221 receptor-mediated synaptic responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the forceps minor in pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortical slices . The inhibitory effect of hallucinogens was mimicked by 5-HT in the presence of selective P08908 and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonists . The inhibitory action of DOB , LSD and 5-HT on the DB01221 transmission was blocked by the 5- Q13049 receptor antagonists R-(+)-alpha- ( 2 , 3-dimethoxyphenil ) -1-[4-fluorophenylethyl]-4-piperidineme thanol ( M100907 ) and ketanserin . However , at low concentrations , when both LSD and DOB by themselves only partially depressed the DB01221 response , they blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-HT , suggesting a partial agonist action . Whereas N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulphonamide ( W-7 , a calmodulin antagonist ) and N- [ 2- [ [ [ 3-(4'-chlorophenyl)- 2-propenyl ] methylamino ] methyl ] phenyl ] -N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4'-methoxy-b enzenesulphonamide phosphate ( KN-93 , a Ca2+/ P62158 -KII inhibitor ) , but not the negative control 2-[N-4'methoxybenzenesulphonyl]amino-N-(4'-chlorophenyl)-2-propeny l-N -methylbenzylamine phosphate ( KN-92 ) , blocked the inhibitory action of LSD and DOB , the selective protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine was without any effect . We conclude that phenethylamine and indoleamine hallucinogens may exert their hallucinogenic effect by interacting with 5- Q13049 receptors via a Ca2+/ P62158 -KII-dependent signal transduction pathway as partial agonists and modulating the DB01221 receptors-mediated sensory , perceptual , affective and cognitive processes .
