Down-regulation of Q03405 and uPA activates caspase-mediated apoptosis and inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) play a major role in invasion and proliferation . A growing body of evidence has suggested that the uPA system promotes tumor metastasis by several different mechanisms , and not just solely by breaking down the Q13201 . In this study we have used RNAi-mediated simultaneous down-regulation of Q03405 and uPA to determine the signaling pathway molecules and caspase-mediated apoptosis . From our in vitro experiments , we have observed that plasmid-based RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Q03405 and uPA in SNB19 human glioma cells caused a decrease in the levels of Q03405 protein and uPA enzyme activities . In addition , we observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of the Ras-activated pathway molecules such as Q05397 , p38MAPK , JNK and P27361 /2 , as well as the MEK-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3k ) pathway , and also retarded the dephosphorylation of p-AKTser473 and p-mTORser2448 , indicative of a feedback signaling mechanism of the Q03405 -uPA system . Activation of caspase 8 accompanied by the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of PARP was also observed and indicative of Fas-mediated apoptosis . The use of FMK-VAD- Q05397 peptides coupled with FITC indicated activation of polycaspases , which was accompanied by the presence of fragmented nuclei . Our studies provide evidence for the presence of a feedback response of the Q03405 -uPA system indicative of the multifaceted role of Q03405 , and also the therapeutic potential of simultaneously targeting Q03405 and uPA in cancer patients .
