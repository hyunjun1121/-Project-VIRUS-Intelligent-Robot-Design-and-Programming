DB11320 improves survival and protects against interleukin-2-induced pulmonary vascular leak syndrome in mice . The therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of metastatic cancer with high doses of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) has been limited by the onset of vascular leak syndrome ( VLS ) and related toxicities . VLS is characterized by an increase in vascular permeability and severe hypotension resulting in interstitial edema and organ failure . This study explores the protective effects of DB05381 ( HDC ) against P60568 -induced toxicities in mice . Treatment with HDC administered before or after P60568 ( 1.25 x 10(6) IU , P55957 ) was shown to protect mice from VLS-related toxicities and mortality in a dose-dependent manner . Survival rates when HDC was added were 56 , 75 and 81 % at doses of 0.47 , 4.7 and 47.0 mg/kg , respectively , compared to 42 % survival with P60568 alone . HDC protected against P60568 -induced macroscopic pulmonary lesions , reduced edema ( up to 62 % reduction in lung wet/dry weight ratio ) and reduced capillary leakage into the lungs as measured by a reduction in Evans Blue dye content . In addition , the systemic effect on serum cytokine levels showed that HDC only moderately lowered P60568 induced P01579 , P05231 , P22301 , Q14116 and P01375 . Serum levels of IL-1beta , P05112 and IL-12 were not measurably induced by P60568 treatment . HDC modulates many cellular functions including regulating cytokines and blocking immune-suppression caused by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generated by the NADPH oxidase . However , the protective effect of HDC on alleviating P60568 -induced pulmonary edema was not related to ROS inhibition . Our data indicate that HDC treatment improves survival and protects against P60568 induced VLS independent of ROS regulation in mice .
