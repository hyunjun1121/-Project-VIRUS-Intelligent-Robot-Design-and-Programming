We created a registry to evaluate long term outcome , efficacy and adverse events for children treated wit P01375 inhibitors in Switzerland . 106 patients ( 68 female/38 male ) were included . 61 patients were treated with DB00005 ( Enbrel ) and 45 with DB00065 ( Remicade ) . Concomitant treatment at baseline included corticosteroids in 26 % and DB00563 in 75 % of the patients . Subjective disease activity three months after initiation of P01375 was better in 81 % , worse in 4 % and stable in 15 % of the patients . In total 24 adverse events in 21 patients were reported .
