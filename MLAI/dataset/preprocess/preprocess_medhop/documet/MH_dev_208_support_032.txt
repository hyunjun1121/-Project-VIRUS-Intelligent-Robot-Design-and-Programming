Translocation ( 3;5 ) ( Q9Y3Q3 ;q13) in a patient with chronic T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder . A 67-year-old patient with large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia is described . At fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis of the peripheral blood , the lymphocytes were positive for CD3 , P01730 , P06127 , CD29 , CD45RA , CD57 , and TCR alpha/beta and negative for P09564 , CD8 , CD16 , CD56 , P15391 , P20273 , and TCR gamma/delta . Bone marrow histology and immunohistochemistry did not reveal any lymphocyte infiltration . Cytogenetic examination of peripheral blood cultures showed a clone with the karyotype 46,XY,t(3;5)( Q9Y3Q3 ;q13) . Molecular analysis revealed rearrangement of the gamma-T-cell-receptor chain . The region 3p25-3p26 which harbors the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene and the P04049 oncogene has been rearranged in a few cases of T-cell leukemia . The translocation in this case has not yet been described and may reflect an alternative mechanism in the pathogenesis of these disorders .
