Cytokeratin immunoreactivity in gliomas . Monoclonal antibodies ( P02730 /3 , P62158 5.2 and P03952 -1 ) and polyclonal antisera against the cytokeratin proteins were reacted with a range of astrocytic tumours , oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas . Seven of 12 cases ( 58 % ) of glioblastoma multiforme , five of eight ( 63 % ) anaplastic astrocytomas and two of five ( 40 % ) well-differentiated astrocytomas were immunoreactive with P02730 /3 but not with the other anti-cytokeratin antibodies . In oligodendrogliomas , P02730 /3 stained isolated astrocyte-like cells as well as scattered neoplastic oligodendrocytes in four of eight cases ( 50 % ) cases . Four ependymomas were negative for all cytokeratin markers examined . The immunostaining of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas with P02730 /3 might represent co-expression of cytokeratin with glial fibrillary acidic protein by gliomas and calls for caution in the use of these antibodies in the differential diagnosis between gliomas and carcinomas .
