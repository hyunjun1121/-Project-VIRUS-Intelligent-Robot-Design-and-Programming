DB00989 improves hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behaviors via P08908 receptor stimulation in olfactory bulbectomized mice . DB00989 is a non-competitive inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) used to treat mild to moderate dementia in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) patients . Although rivastigmine reportedly ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in these patients , its ability to improve Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia ( BPSD ) remains unclear . To determine whether rivastigmine treatment antagonizes depression-like behaviors , we chronically administered rivastigmine ( 0.1-1.0mg/kg ) to olfactory bulbectomized ( OBX ) mice once a day for 2weeks , starting 2weeks after bulbectomy . Chronic treatment at 0.3 or 1.0mg/kg dose dependently and significantly improved depression-like behaviors , as assessed by tail suspension ( Q16762 ) , forced swim ( P19883 ) , locomotion and novelty-suppressed feeding ( NSFT ) tests . Importantly , co-administration with WAY-100635 ( 1.0mg/kg ) , a P08908 receptor antagonist , but not ketanserin ( 1.0mg/kg , ) , a 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist , completely blocked rivastigmine-induced anti-depressive effects , suggesting that P08908 receptor stimulation mediates this activity . Consistent with this observation , rivastigmine treatment significantly rescued impaired neurogenesis observed in OBX mice in a P08908 receptor-dependent manner . Furthermore , enhanced protein kinase B ( Akt ) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation seen following rivastigmine treatment was closely associated with improved neurogenesis . These effects were blocked by WAY-100635 but not ketanserin treatment . Finally , we confirmed that P08908 but not 5- Q13049 receptor stimulation by specific agonists mimicked rivastigmine-induced anti-depression activity and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis . We conclude that , in addition to enhancing the cholinergic system , rivastigmine treatment restores normal function of the hippocampal serotonergic system , an activity that likely ameliorates depressive behaviors in AD patients .
