Apoptotic markers in a prostate cancer cell line : effect of ellagic acid . Ellagic acid ( EA ) inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in cultured cells ; however , the precise molecular mechanism involved in EA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is unknown . The aim of the present study was to delineate possible apoptotic pathway(s) involved in the EA-mediated chemotherapeutic effects in the LNCaP human prostatic cancer cell line . EA produced anti-proliferative effects through inhibition of rapamycin ( P42345 ) activation and a reduction in intracellular levels of β-catenin . Moreover , we demonstrated that EA induced apoptosis via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins , silent information regulator 1 ( Q96EB6 ) , human antigen R ( Q15717 ) and heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) . EA modulated the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor ( O95831 ) resulting in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels and the activation of caspase-3 . Finally , we demonstrated that EA reduced both transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) levels . EA treatment resulted in the increased expression of the tumor suppressor protein P38936 and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells . In conclusion , the results suggest that EA treatment represents a new and highly effective strategy in reducing prostate cancer carcinogenesis .
