Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm : a method for developing classification structure-activity relationships . Classification methods allow for the development of structure-activity relationship models when the target property is categorical rather than continuous . We describe a classification method which fits descriptor splines to activities , with descriptors selected using a genetic algorithm . This method , which we identify as SFGA , is compared to the well-established techniques of recursive partitioning ( RP ) and soft independent modeling by class analogy ( SIMCA ) using five series of compounds : cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , benzodiazepine receptor ( BZR ) ligands , estrogen receptor ( ER ) ligands , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitors , and monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors . Only 1-D and 2-D descriptors were used . Approximately 40 % of compounds in each series were assigned to a test set , " cherry-picked " from the complete set such that they lie outside the training set as much as possible . SFGA produced models that were more predictive for all but the P00374 set , for which SIMCA was most predictive . RP gave the least predictive models for all but the MAO set . A similar trend was observed when using training and test sets to which compounds were randomly assigned and when gradually eliminating compounds from the ( designed ) training set . The stability of models was examined for the random and reduced sets , where stability means that classification statistics and the selected descriptors are similar for models derived from different sets . Here , SIMCA produced the most stable models , followed by SFGA and RP . We show that a consensus approach that combines all three methods outperforms the single best model for all data sets .
