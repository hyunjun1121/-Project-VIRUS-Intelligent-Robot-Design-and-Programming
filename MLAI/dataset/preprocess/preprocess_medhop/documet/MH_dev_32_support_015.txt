MEK inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer . P01116 mutations are the most common mutations in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) with adenocarcinoma histology . P01116 mutations result in the activation of the RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , and agents that target RAF-MEK- P29323 pathways have been investigated in P01116 mutant NSCLC . The two agents furthest in development are selumetinib and trametinib . DB08911 has greater binding for the Q02750 /2 allosteric site , and generally has superior pharmacokinetics . A randomized phase II trial of docetaxel with and without selumetinib revealed that the combination resulted numerically superior overall survival , and a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate . However , a concerning rate of hospital admission , grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , and febrile neutropenia was observed with the combination . Trials have investigated MEK inhibitors as single agents and in combination with erlotinib , and the data do not support the further development . The activity of MEK inhibitors appears to be similar in patients with P01116 mutant and wild-type NSCLC suggesting P01116 mutation status is not a reliable biomarker for efficacy . It is possible that mutations of genes in addition to P01116 mutations impact the activity of MEK inhibitors , or specific subsets of P01116 mutations may be resistant or susceptible to MEK inhibition . Other potential explanations are gene amplifications , alternative RNA splicing of genes resulting in activation of their protein products , and deregulation of noncoding RNAs and consequent altered protein expression .
