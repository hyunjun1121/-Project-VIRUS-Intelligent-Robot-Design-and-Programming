Roles of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) in hyperpnea-induced constriction in guinea pigs . It has been reported that hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs is a potential model for exercise-induced asthma in humans . We hypothesized that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) could modulate leukotriene D4 ( LTD4 ) -induced responses and be involved in the pathophysiology in this asthma model . We measured tracheal ( Ptr ) and alveolar pressure ( PA ) using alveolar capsules in open-chested , mechanically ventilated ( f = 1 Hz , VT = 9 ml/kg , PEEP = 4 cm H2O ) guinea pigs . Animals were intravenously pretreated with saline ( SAL ) , P80511 (8-37) ( P80511 receptor antagonist ) , P80511 , MK-571 ( Q9Y271 antagonist ) , MK-886 ( P09917 inhibitor ) , or P80511 (8-37) + MK-571 , and then underwent dry gas hyperpnea challenge ( HC , 95 % 02-5 % CO2 , 150 breaths/min , 7 min ) . We calculated resistance of lung ( RL ) , tissue ( Rti ) , and airway ( Raw ) . HC increased RL , Rti , and Raw in SAL controls ( 322 +/- 27 , 430 +/- 59 , 299 +/- 23 % baseline , respectively ) . MK-571 , MK-886 , and P80511 significantly reduced the responses to HC , while P80511 (8-37) enhanced HC-induced responses . Pretreatment with P80511 (8-37) and MK-571 in combination attenuated HC-induced constriction . In addition , pretreatment with P80511 reduced responses induced by intravenous administration of LTD4 . These observations suggest that P80511 might be involved in the pathophysiology of hyperpnea-induced constriction in guinea pigs via modulation of LTD4-elicited responses .
