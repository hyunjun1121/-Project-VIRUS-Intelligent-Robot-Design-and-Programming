Increased thromboxane biosynthesis during coronary thrombolysis . Evidence that platelet activation and thromboxane A2 modulate the response to tissue-type plasminogen activator in vivo . Platelet activation is markedly increased during coronary thrombolysis and limits the response to thrombolytic therapy . A possible mediator of platelet activation in this setting is thromboxane ( TX ) A2 , a potent platelet agonist formed in greatly increased amounts during coronary thrombolysis in man . To address this hypothesis , we examined the role of TXA2 in modulating the response to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) in a chronic canine model of coronary thrombosis . Reperfusion occurred in 60 +/- 5 minutes and was complicated by spontaneous reocclusion . The times to reperfusion and reocclusion were platelet-dependent . Consistent with a role for TXA2 in this process , TXA2 biosynthesis , determined a excretion of its enzymatic metabolite , 2,3-dinor-TXB2 , was markedly increased during coronary thrombolysis . Furthermore , inhibition of TXA2 by aspirin , given alone or in combination with a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist , accelerated reperfusion and partly inhibited cyclic flow variations during reperfusion . The delay in reperfusion and reocclusion induced by TXA2 appeared to be mediated by platelet aggregation since the F(ab')2 fragment of DB00054 , a monoclonal antibody to the platelet P08514 /IIIa , also accelerated reperfusion and prevented reocclusion without altering TXA2 biosynthesis . These finding suggest that platelet aggregation limits the response to coronary thrombolysis and that platelet activation in this setting is partly TXA2-dependent .
