P08514 /IIIa antagonists and other anti-integrins . Platelet aggregation involves the binding of adhesive proteins ( fibrinogen , P04275 ) to the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin , which assumes a high-affinity state for adhesive proteins during platelet activation . The occupied integrin sends signals back into the platelet , and the bound adhesive protein forms the bridges linking platelets together . Anti-integrin therapy is designed to inhibit this process in arterial thrombosis . DB00054 , mouse-human chimeric Fab fragments , blocks platelet aggregation and provides proven clinical benefit in acute situations such as in patients with unstable angina undergoing angioplasty or stenting . DB00063 and tirofiban are small molecular mass inhibitors also in current use . In contrast , oral inhibitors of alphaIIbbeta3 have proved disappointing , provoking increased mortality without assuring an adequate blockade of alphaIIbbeta3 . The problems of using anti-integrin therapy are discussed in this article as are ways of improving its efficacity . Final thoughts provide ideas for a new generation of inhibitors .
