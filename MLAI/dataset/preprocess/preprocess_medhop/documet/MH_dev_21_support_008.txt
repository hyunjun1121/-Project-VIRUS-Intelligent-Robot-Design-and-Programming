Comparison of expression profiles induced by dust mite in airway epithelia reveals a common pathway . BACKGROUND : Airway epithelial cells have shown to be active participants in the defense against pathogens by producing signaling and other regulatory molecules in response to the encounter . METHODS : In previous manuscripts , we have studied the effect of house dust mite ( HDM ) extract on both an epithelial cell-line ( H292 ) and primary nasal epithelial cell . When we compare these responses we conclude that the H292 cells more closely resemble nasal epithelium of healthy controls ( share 107 probe-sets ) than of allergic individuals ( share 17 probe-sets ) . RESULTS : Interestingly , probably because of an absent intraindividual variation between samples , more probe-sets ( 8280 ) change expression significantly in H292 than in either healthy ( 555 ) or allergic ( 401 ) epithelium . CONCLUSIONS : A direct comparison of all the responses in these epithelial cells reveals a core-response to HDM of just 29 genes . These genes ( P78556 , P10145 , P19875 , P09341 , IL-1B , P15514 , P21580 , Q99075 , P35354 , P12643 , P01130 , Q03405 , P00749 , Q00653 , P19838 , P05412 , P18847 , P18146 , O15118 , Q8IUC6 , P29317 , P29279 , P28562 , O43609 , TLR-3 , complement factor P01024 , Q9Y6Y0 , SerpinB3 , and Q9Y617 ) have described links with allergy or inflammation and may even describe the well-established relationship between viral infections and allergic exacerbations or allergy development .
