Effect of (-)-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinoid on the hepatic redox state of mice . (-)-Delta(9)- DB00470 ( Delta(9)-THC ) , a psychoactive component of marijuana , has been reported to induce oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro . In this study , we administered Delta(9)-THC to healthy C57BL/6J mice aged 15 weeks in order to determine its effect on hepatic redox state . Mice were divided into 3 groups : Delta(9)-THC ( N = 10 ) , treated with 10 mg/kg body weight Delta(9)-THC daily ; VCtrl ( N = 10 ) , treated with vehicle [ 1:1:18 , cremophor EL ( polyoxyl 35 castor oil ) /ethanol/saline ] ; Ctrl ( N = 10 ) , treated with saline . Animals were injected ip twice a day with 5 mg/kg body weight for 10 days . Lipid peroxidation , protein carbonylation and DNA oxidation were used as biomarkers of oxidative stress . The endogenous antioxidant defenses analyzed were glutathione ( DB00143 ) levels as well as enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione S-transferase , glutathione reductase , and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) in liver homogenates . The levels of mRNA of the cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 were also monitored . Treatment with Delta(9)-THC did not produce significant changes in oxidative stress markers or in mRNA levels of P21554 and CB2 receptors in the liver of mice , but attenuated the increase in the selenium-dependent GPx activity ( Delta(9)-THC : 8 % ; VCtrl : 23 % increase ) and the DB00143 /oxidized DB00143 ratio ( Delta(9)-THC : 61 % ; VCtrl : 96 % increase ) , caused by treatment with the vehicle . Delta(9)-THC administration did not show any harmful effects on lipid peroxidation , protein carboxylation or DNA oxidation in the healthy liver of mice but attenuated unexpected effects produced by the vehicle containing ethanol/cremophor EL .
