DB01268 ( SUTENT , SU11248 ) suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis in xenograft models of human hepatocellular carcinoma . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common and third deadliest primary neoplasm . Since HCC is a particularly vascular solid tumor , we determined the antitumor and antiangiogenic activities of sunitinib malate , a potent inhibitor of two receptors involved in angiogenesis - vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) . In the present study , we reported that treatment of HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells with sunitinib led to growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion . DB01268 inhibited phosphorylation of P35968 at Tyr951 and P09619 at Tyr1021 both in vitro and in vivo . DB01268 also suppressed tumor growth of five patient-derived xenografts . DB01268 -induced tumor growth inhibition was associated with increased apoptosis , reduced microvessel density and inhibition of cell proliferation . This study provides a strong rationale for further clinical investigation of sunitinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma .
