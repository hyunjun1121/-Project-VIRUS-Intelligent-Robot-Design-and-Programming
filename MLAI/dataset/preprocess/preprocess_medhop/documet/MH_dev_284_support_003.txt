Endogenous concentrations of ouabain act as a cofactor to stimulate fluid secretion and cyst growth of in vitro ADPKD models via DB02527 and P00533 -Src-MEK pathways . In autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) , renal cysts develop by aberrant epithelial cell proliferation and transepithelial fluid secretion . We previously showed that ouabain increases proliferation of cultured human ADPKD cells via stimulation of the P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) -Src-MEK/ P29323 signaling pathway . We examined whether ouabain affects fluid secretion and in vitro cyst growth of human ADPKD cell monolayers , ADPKD cell microcysts cultured in a three-dimensional collagen matrix , and metanephric organ cultures from Pkd1(m1Bei) mice . Physiological concentrations of ouabain alone did not affect net transepithelial basal-to-apical fluid transport in ADPKD monolayers or growth of cultured ADPKD microcysts . In contrast , in the presence of forskolin or 8-bromo- DB02527 , ouabain significantly enhanced ADPKD fluid secretion and microcyst expansion . Ouabain exerted this effect by enhancing DB02527 -dependent Cl(-) secretion via the P13569 . Similarly , ouabain accelerated DB02527 -dependent cyst enlargement in Pkd1(m1Bei) mice metanephroi , with a more prominent response in homozygous than heterozygous mice . Ouabain had no effect on fluid secretion and cystogenesis of normal human kidney cells and caused only slight cystic dilations in wild-type mouse kidneys . The effects of ouabain in ADPKD cells and Pkd1(m1Bei) metanephroi were prevented by inhibitors of P00533 ( AG1478 ) , Src ( Q99463 ) , and MEK ( U0126 ) . Together , our results show that ouabain , used in physiological concentrations , has synergistic effects on DB02527 -mediated fluid secretion and cyst growth , via activation of the P00533 -Src-MEK pathway . These data provide important evidence for the role of ouabain as an endogenous hormone that exacerbates ADPKD cyst progression .
