Genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other specific types of diabetes ; its role in treatment modalities . Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is among the most challenging health issues of the 21st century and is associated with an alarming rise in the incidence . The pathophysiological processes that lead to development of T2DM are still unclear , however impairment in insulin secretion and/or action is clearly indicated . Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder with multiple genes located on different chromosomes contributing to its susceptibility . Analysis of the genetic factors is further complicated by the fact that numerous environmental factors interact with genes to produce the disorder . Only a minority of cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by single gene defects and one example is maturity onset diabetes of the young ( MODY ) . Previous studies indicated that variants in genes encoding the pancreatic β-cell K+ DB00171 channel subunits Kir6.2 ( Q14654 ) and Q09428 ( Q09428 ) are associated with neonatal diabetes . Six different types of maturity onset diabetes of young ( MODY ) have been identified based on characteristic gene defect . The common Pro12Ala polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( Q07869 -γ ) gene was confirmed in several studies to be associated with type 2 diabetes as well . More recently , studies reported variants within a novel gene , Q9NQB0 , as a putative susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes across many ethnic backgrounds around the world . MODY patients respond better to sulphonylureas and metformin , while neonatal diabetes patients with genetic mutations can be changed from insulin to oral drugs . We hereby provide a comprehensive review on the role of genetics in type 2 diabetes mellitus .
