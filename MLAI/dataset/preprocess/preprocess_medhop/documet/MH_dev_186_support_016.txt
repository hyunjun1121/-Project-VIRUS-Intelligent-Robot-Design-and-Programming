Recent therapeutic strategy for sustained ventricular tachycardia in Japan . We investigated the therapeutic principles and strategies to treat sustained ventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) as five leading medical institutions in the Tokyo area and summarized the present situation of SVT treatment in Japan . Catheter ablation ( P00519 ) has been almost established to be effective in idiopathic ventricular tachycardia ( IVT ) and was used as the last treatment in 60.3 % of IVTs in this series . P00519 may be the first option of therapy for IVT . In patients with SVT who have underlying cardiac diseases , the last treatment was class I drugs in 8.3 % , class III drugs in 34.3 % , combination drug therapy in 24.0 % , P00519 in 33.3 % , surgical therapy ( Q09428 ) in 7.3 % , and implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) in 12.5 % ( nonpharmacological therapy in combination with other therapy ) . The use of class I drugs was not common , whereas class III drugs were used more frequently in patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction . In some patients with reduced cardiac function , a combination of class III drugs and non-pharmacological therapy is appropriate .
