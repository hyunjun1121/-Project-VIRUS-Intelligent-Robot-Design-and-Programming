CD8 T cells and P12830 in host responses against oropharyngeal candidiasis . BACKGROUND : Oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is the most common oral infection in HIV(+) persons . Previous studies suggest a role for CD8(+) T cells against OPC when P01730 (+) T cells are lost , but enhanced susceptibility to infection occurs when CD8(+) T-cell migration is inhibited by reduced tissue P12830 . OBJECTIVE : To conduct a longitudinal study of tissue CD8(+) T-cells and P12830 expression before , during , and after the episodes of OPC . METHODS : Oral fungal burden was monitored and tissue was evaluated for CD8(+) T cells and P12830 over a 1-year period in HIV(+) persons with a history of , or an acute episode of , OPC . RESULTS : While longitudinal analyses precluded formal interpretations , point prevalence analyses of the data set revealed that when patients experiencing OPC were successfully treated , tissue P12830 expression was similar to that in patients who had not experienced OPC , and higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells were distributed throughout OPC(-) tissue under normal expression of P12830 . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that ( 1 ) reduction in tissue P12830 expression in patients with OPC(+) is not permanent , and ( 2 ) high numbers of CD8(+) T cells can be distributed throughout OPC(-) tissue under normal P12830 expression . Together , these results extend our previous studies and continue to support a role for CD8(+) T cells in host defense against OPC .
