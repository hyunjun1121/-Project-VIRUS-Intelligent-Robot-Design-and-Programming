Crystal structure of dihydrofolate reductase from Plasmodium vivax : pyrimethamine displacement linked with mutation-induced resistance . DB00205 ( Pyr ) targets dihydrofolate reductase of Plasmodium vivax ( PvDHFR ) as well as other malarial parasites , but its use as antimalarial is hampered by the widespread high resistance . Comparison of the crystal structures of PvDHFR from wild-type and the Pyr-resistant ( SP21 , DB00133 -58 --> DB00125 + DB00133 -117 --> DB00174 ) strain as complexes with NADPH and Pyr or its analog lacking p-Cl ( Pyr20 ) clearly shows that the steric conflict arising from the side chain of DB00174 -117 in the mutant enzyme , accompanied by the loss of binding to DB00133 -120 , is mainly responsible for the reduction in binding of Pyr . Pyr20 still effectively inhibits both the wild-type and SP21 proteins , and the x-ray structures of these complexes show how Pyr20 fits into both active sites without steric strain . These structural insights suggest a general approach for developing new generations of antimalarial P00374 inhibitors that , by only occupying substrate space of the active site , would retain binding affinity with the mutant enzymes .
