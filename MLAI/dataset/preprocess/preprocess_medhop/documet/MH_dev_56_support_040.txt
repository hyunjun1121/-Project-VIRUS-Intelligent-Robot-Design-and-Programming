Immune function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept . DB00005 , a recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) inhibitor that binds both soluble and cell-bound P01375 , has been shown to reduce disease activity and inhibit joint destruction when administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Because P01375 receptors are found on many types of cells that modulate the immune response , we evaluated the general immune function of a subset of RA patients in a blinded clinical study . No significant differences were seen between patients treated with etanercept or placebo in the surface antigen phenotypes of peripheral blood leukocytes , T cell proliferative responses , neutrophil function , delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reactions , serum immunoglobulin levels , or incidence of infections . Although this observational study was relatively small and could detect only major changes in immunological status , the stability of immune function over time in patients receiving etanercept corroborates the findings in clinical studies , which suggest that etanercept does not alter overall global immune function .
