Protein kinase C activation and the development of diabetic complications . Recent studies have identified that the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and increased diacylglycerol ( DAG ) levels initiated by hyperglycemia are associated with many vascular abnormalities in retinal , renal , and cardiovascular tissues . Among the various PKC isoforms , the beta- and delta-isoforms appear to be activated preferentially in the vasculatures of diabetic animals , although other PKC isoforms are also increased in the renal glomeruli and retina . The glucose-induced activation of PKC has been shown to increase the production of extracellular matrix and cytokines ; to enhance contractility , permeability , and vascular cell proliferation ; to induce the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 ; and to inhibit Na+-K+-ATPase . The synthesis and characterization of a specific inhibitor for P05771 isoforms have confirmed the role of PKC activation in mediating hyperglycemic effects on vascular cells , as described above , and provide in vivo evidence that PKC activation could be responsible for abnormal retinal and renal hemodynamics in diabetic animals . Transgenic mice overexpressing P05771 isoform in the myocardium developed cardiac hypertrophy and failure , further supporting the hypothesis that P05771 isoform activation can cause vascular dysfunctions . Interestingly , hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may also mediate the adverse effects of P05771 isoforms by the activation of the DAG-PKC pathway , since treatment with D- DB00163 was able to prevent many glucose-induced vascular dysfunctions and inhibit DAG-PKC activation . Clinical studies are now in progress to determine whether P05771 inhibition can prevent diabetic complications .
