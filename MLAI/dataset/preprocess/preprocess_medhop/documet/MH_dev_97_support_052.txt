Calpain and STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase ( P54829 ) activation contribute to extrasynaptic DB01221 receptor localization in a Huntington 's disease mouse model . In Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , the mutant huntingtin ( mhtt ) protein is associated with striatal dysfunction and degeneration . Excitotoxicity and early synaptic defects are attributed , in part , to altered DB01221 receptor ( NMDAR ) trafficking and function . Deleterious extrasynaptic NMDAR localization and signalling are increased early in yeast artificial chromosome mice expressing full-length mhtt with 128 polyglutamine repeats ( YAC128 mice ) . NMDAR trafficking at the plasma membrane is regulated by dephosphorylation of the NMDAR subunit Q13224 tyrosine 1472 ( Y1472 ) residue by STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase ( P54829 ) . NMDAR function is also regulated by calpain cleavage of the Q13224 C-terminus . Activation of both P54829 and calpain is calcium-dependent , and disruption of calcium homeostasis occurs early in the HD striatum . Here , we show increased calpain cleavage of Q13224 at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites , and elevated extrasynaptic total Q13224 expression in the YAC128 striatum . Calpain inhibition significantly reduced extrasynaptic Q13224 expression in the YAC128 but not wild-type striatum . Furthermore , calpain inhibition reduced whole-cell NMDAR current and the surface/internal Q13224 ratio in co-cultured striatal neurons , without affecting synaptic Q13224 localization . Synaptic P54829 activity was also significantly higher in the YAC128 striatum , correlating with decreased Q13224 Y1472 phosphorylation . A substrate-trapping P54829 protein ( TAT- P54829 C-S ) significantly increased Q9P2U7 - Q13224 colocalization , as well as increasing synaptic Q13224 expression and Y1472 phosphorylation . Moreover , combined calpain inhibition and P54829 inactivation reduced extrasynaptic , while increasing synaptic Q13224 expression in the YAC128 striatum . These results indicate that increased P54829 and calpain activation contribute to altered NMDAR localization in an HD mouse model , suggesting new therapeutic targets for HD .
