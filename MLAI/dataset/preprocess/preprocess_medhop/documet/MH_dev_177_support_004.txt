Genomic imbalances in key ion channel genes and telomere shortening in sudden cardiac death victims . Sudden cardiac death ( O00767 ) can be caused by a number of reasons . Previous works have identified the genetic causes , such as alterations in the DNA sequence , for many of these diseases . We hypothesize that some patients may show genomic imbalances and changes in the gene copy number leading to genetic instability . To clarify this , we analysed DNA samples from O00767 victims using comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) , a molecular cytogenetic technique that permits the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances , and telomere length measurement . DNA derived from peripheral blood and heart tissue of 14 O00767 cases and six apparently healthy control individuals were subjected to CGH analysis . Telomere length measurements were done by the Southern blotting method . Eight out of 14 O00767 cases exhibited changes in DNA/gene copy number . CGH analysis showed variation in the gene copy number of some of the genes associated with potassium ( Q14722 , Q12809 , and P22459 ) and calcium ( Q92736 , P16615 ) ions which are involved in maintaining the ionic balance of the heart . Alterations in TERC and O14746 genes were also detected in O00767 victims . In nine O00767 victims shorter telomeres were detected . This might have resulted from excessive cellular proliferation and/or oxidative stress in these individuals . Copy number changes observed and telomere shortening detected in O00767 cases would possibly explain at least some of the causes of O00767 at early ages in humans . Identification of biomarkers of O00767 is of great importance and thus the present study will facilitate the identification of some of the biomarkers .
