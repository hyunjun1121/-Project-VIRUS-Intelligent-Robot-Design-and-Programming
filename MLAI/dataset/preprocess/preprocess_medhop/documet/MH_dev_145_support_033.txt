Relationship between P01375 , P01374 and TNFRII gene polymorphisms and outcome after unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation in a Chinese population . This study aimed to analyze the association between cytokine gene polymorphisms and outcome following allogeneic hematopoietic P09683 ( allo-HSCT ) . A total of 138 unrelated donor/recipient pairs who underwent allo-HSCT from 2001 to 2009 were tested for P01375 -1031 ( T > C ) , -863 ( C > A ) , -857 ( C > T ) , -238 ( G > A ) , P01374 +252 ( A > G ) and TNFRII codon 196 ( T > G ) single nucleotide polymorphisms by multiplex SnaPshot analysis . Transplantation involving recipients and/or donors with P01375 -857 C/C genotype or P01374 +252 G allele-positivity resulted in a higher incidence of acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) , which was independent of HLA mismatching . In multivariate analysis , P01375 -857 C/C genotype donors ( relative risk (RR)=2.29 , P=0.006 ) and P01374 +252 G allele-positive recipients ( RR=1.789 , P=0.036 ) were found to be significantly associated with an increased incidence of aGVHD . P01375 -857 C/C genotype donors ( RR=3.748 , P=0.002 ) and P01374 +252 G allele-positive recipients ( RR=1.823 , P=0.063 ) were also associated with the development of grades II-IV aGVHD . TNFRII polymorphism in recipients was also related to relapse rate , but no significant associations were found between P01375 , P01374 or TNFRII 196 genotype and cGVHD , relapse or overall survival after transplantation . These results provide the first report of an association between P01375 , P01374 and TNFRII polymorphic features and outcome of allo-HSCT in a Chinese population , and suggest an interaction between P01375 -857 and P01374 +252 genotypes and risk of aGVHD .
