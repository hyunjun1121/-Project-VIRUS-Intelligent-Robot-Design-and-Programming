Combined olaparib and oxaliplatin inhibits tumor proliferation and induces G2/M arrest and γ- P16104 foci formation in colorectal cancer . BACKGROUND : Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( P09874 ) has an important role in homologous recombination repair . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of P09874 inhibitor on oxaliplatin treatment for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . METHODS : A cell counting kit-8 assay was used to determine the sensitivity of CRC cells to olaparib and/or oxaliplatin . The gene and protein expressions of P09874 and the gamma histone variant P16104 ( γ P16104 ) were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting , respectively . The γ P16104 foci formation assay was used to investigate the influence of treatments on cells . Flow cytometry was used to examine the changes in cell cycle distribution . Finally , we investigated the combination of olaparib and oxaliplatin in the CRC tumor model . RESULTS : DB09074 changed the expression of γ P16104 and P09874 , and increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin . The γ P16104 foci assay showed that olaparib did not induce double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) alone , but it enhanced the induction of DSBs by oxaliplatin . The flow cytometry results showed that cells exposed to combination treatment had more G2/M-phase cells than control . Additionally , tumor xenograft studies suggested that combined treatment inhibited the growth of CRC . CONCLUSION : CRC cells are sensitized to combined treatment with olaparib and oxaliplatin , and this could be a promising strategy for clinical chemotherapy in CRC .
