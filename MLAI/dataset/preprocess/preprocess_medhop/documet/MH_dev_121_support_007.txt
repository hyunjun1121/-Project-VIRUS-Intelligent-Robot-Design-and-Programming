[ Development of simplified and rapid detection assay for genetic polymorphisms influencing drug response and its clinical applications ] . Clinically important genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism and drug response have typically been discovered on the basis of phenotypic differences among individuals from different populations . Routine genotyping before drug therapy may enable the identification of responders , nonresponders , or patients at increased risk of toxicity . Automated , high-throughput detecting methods for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) are highly desirable in many clinical laboratories . The aim of this study is to develop a high-throughput genotyping method for detecting SNPs influencing drug response in the Japanese population . We have developed three real-time PCR assays for detecting SNPs in the human drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets . The assay for simultaneously detecting P11509 , P20813 , P11712 , P33260 , P33261 , P10635 , P05181 , P20815 , NAT2 , P51580 , Q12882 , P22309 , P05091 , P00325 , P08183 , P11597 , P12821 -1 , P07550 , P28223 , P49441 , P48061 , and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms takes less than 1.5 h . With the clinical application of NAT2 genotyping , we found statistically significant difference between the incidence of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) and the NAT2 genotype . The incidence of the ADRs was significantly higher in the slow type than the in other two types , as 5 of the 6 patients were of the slowtype , and the other was the intermediatetype , while no patients of the rapidtype has developed any ADRs .
