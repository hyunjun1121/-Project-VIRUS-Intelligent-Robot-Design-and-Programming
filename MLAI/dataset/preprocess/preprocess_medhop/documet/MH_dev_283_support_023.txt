Serotonin neurotoxins -- past and present . Autoxidation pathways and redox reactions of dihydroxytryptamines ( 5,6- and 5,7- DB02901 ) and of 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OH-DA ) are illustrated , and their potential role in aminergic neurotoxicity is discussed . It is proposed that certain aspects of the cytotoxicity of 6-OH-DA and of the DHTs , namely redox cycling of their quinone- and quinoneimine-intermediates as a source of free radicals , may also apply to quinoidal reactive intermediates and to glutathionyl- or cysteinyl conjugates ( " thioether adducts " ) of o-dihydroxylated ( catechol-like ) metabolites of certain substituted amphetamines ( of methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( DB01454 ) and of methylenedioxyamphetamine ( MDA ) ) . Despite similarities in their primary interaction with the plasmalemmal ( serotonergic transporter/dopamine transporter , P31645 / Q01959 ) and vesicular monoamine transporters ( Q05940 ) , DB01454 and fenfluramine ( N-ethyl-meta-trifluoromethamphetamine , Fen ) differ substantially in many aspects of their metabolism , pharmacokinetics , pharmacology , and neurotoxicology profile ; the consequences of these differences for neuronal response patterns and long-term survival prospects are not yet fully understood . However , sustained hyperthermia appears to be a critical factor in these differences . Methodological requirements for adequate detection and description of pre- and postsynaptic forms of drug-induced neurotoxicity are exemplified using recently published accounts . The inclusion of microglial markers into research strategies has widened contemporary pathogenetic concepts on methamphetamine ( MA ) -induced neurotoxicity as an example of inflammatory neurodegeneration , thus complementing the traditional ROS and RNS-dependent stress models . Amphetamine-type neurotoxicity studies may assist in elaborating of preventive strategies for human neurodegenerative disorders .
