Plasmid DNA encoding human carcinoembryonic antigen ( P06731 ) adsorbed onto cationic microparticles induces protective immunity against colon cancer in P06731 -transgenic mice . A carcinoembryonic antigen ( P06731 ) -based DNA vaccine , adsorbed onto cationic microparticles of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) induced tumor-protective immunity against a lethal challenge of MC38- P06731 colon carcinoma cells in P06731 -transgenic mice that was more potent than that of the corresponding naked DNA vaccine . Boosting with a plasmid encoding murine GM- P04141 increased the vaccine 's efficacy leading to a complete rejection of tumor cells in 50 % of mice . This effect was due to activation of MHC class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells coupled with an increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines P01579 , P01375 and P60568 . Also , specific activation of dendritic cells was indicated by a two-three-fold upregulation of their costimulatory P33681 and MHC class II molecules . This approach may be a promising new strategy for the rational design of cancer vaccines for future clinical applications .
