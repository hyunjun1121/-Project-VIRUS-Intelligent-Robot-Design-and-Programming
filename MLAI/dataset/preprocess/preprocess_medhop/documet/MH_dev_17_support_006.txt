Transcript profiling in peripheral T-cell lymphoma , not otherwise specified , and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identifies distinct tumor profile signatures . To glean biological differences and similarities of peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified [ PTCL-NOS ] to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , a transcriptosome analysis was done on five PTCL-NOS and four DLBCL patients and validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR on 10 selected genes . Normal peripheral blood T cells , peripheral blood B cells , and lymph node were used as controls . The resultant gene expression profile delineated distinct " tumor profile signatures " for PTCL-NOS and DLBCL . Several highly overexpressed genes in both PTCL-NOS and DLBCL involve the immune network , stroma , angiogenesis , and cell survival cascades that make important contributions to lymphomagenesis . Inflammatory chemokines and their receptors likely play a central role in these complex interrelated pathways : P13500 and P61073 in PTCL-NOS and P13501 and P32246 in DLBCL . Highly overexpressed oncogenes unique to PTCL-NOS are P17947 , O14965 , alpha- P09619 , and O60880 , whereas in DLBCL they are P11309 , Q9P1W9 , P07948 , Q16548 , and P51153 . Oncogenes common to both lymphomas are Q9Y5Q3 , MET , NF-kappaB2 , P06239 , and P07948 . Several tumor suppressors are also down-regulated ( P56180 , MGC154 , Q13635 , P78524 , and P41567 ) . This study illustrates the relevance of tumor-stroma immune trafficking and identified potential novel prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention .
