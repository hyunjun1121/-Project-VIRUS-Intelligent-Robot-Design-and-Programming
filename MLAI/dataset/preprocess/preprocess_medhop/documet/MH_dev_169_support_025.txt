Hematopoietic differentiation of embryonic stem cells : an in vitro model to study gene regulation during megakaryocytopoiesis . We are interested in the regulation of the tissue specificity of the megakaryocyte-specific platelet glycoprotein IIb gene . The murine embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are able to differentiate into erythroid , mast and granulomonocytic cells in appropriate culture conditions . Our goal is to optimize the production of myeloid cells including megakaryocytes ( MKs ) by ES cells . We have found that coculture with MS-5 stromal cells and the presence of a cocktail of hematopoietic growth factors ( HGFs ) [ stem cell factor , interleukin 3 ( P08700 ) , P05231 , IL-11 , G- P04141 and erythropoietin ] had a high synergistic activity on differentiation of ES cells into pure and MK-containing myeloid colonies from day 12 embryoid bodies . P40225 increased the number of MKs only when added to the P14210 cocktail in the presence of MS-5 cells . Interestingly , many MKs exhibited a " hairy " appearance evocative of pseudopodial proplatelet formation . Expression of genes specific for the megakaryocytic lineage , P08514 , P02776 , mpl and P05106 , was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) during differentiation of ES cells , and their relative time course was evaluated . This demonstrates that optimized culture conditions for the differentiation of ES cells into the MK lineage provide a useful tool for the study of the regulation of expression of genes during megakaryocytopoiesis .
