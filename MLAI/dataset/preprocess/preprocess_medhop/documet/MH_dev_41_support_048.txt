DB00087 for the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease . DB00087 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the P31358 antigen , which is expressed on the surface of various hematopoietic cells such as B and T lymphocytes , and has been widely used for preventing acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) . Administration of 100 mg alemtuzumab before transplantation has resulted in a low incidence of acute GVHD in HLA-matched and mismatched transplantation from either related or unrelated donors . However , because alemtuzumab could remain in the blood at the lympholytic level 1-2 months after transplantation , immune reconstitution was substantially delayed , leading to a high incidence of viral infection and relapse . A dose reduction of alemtuzumab was attempted in a reduced-intensity conditioning setting to facilitate immune reconstitution , and this resulted in earlier immune reconstitution , but the clinical benefits were unclear . The dose of alemtuzumab and the timing of its administration should be optimized to maximize the benefit of acute GVHD suppression and minimize the risk of infection and relapse . Another strategy to facilitate immune reconstitution and augment anti-tumor effects is donor cell infusion of T and NK cells . Although there is accumulating evidence regarding the use of alemtuzumab for acute GVHD prevention , information on the salvage treatment for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD is still limited .
