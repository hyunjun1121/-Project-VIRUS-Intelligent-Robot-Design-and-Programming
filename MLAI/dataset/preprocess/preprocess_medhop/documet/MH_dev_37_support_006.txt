Association testing of panic disorder candidate genes using Q13308 challenge in healthy volunteers . Despite continuing efforts to determine genetic vulnerability to panic disorder ( PD ) , the studies of candidate genes in this disorder have produced inconsistent or negative , results . Laboratory panic induction may have a potential in testing genetic substrate of PD . In this study we aimed to explore the effects of several genetic polymorphisms previously implicated in PD on the susceptibility to cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide ( Q13308 ) challenge in healthy subjects . The study sample consisted of 110 healthy volunteers ( 47 males and 63 females , mean age 22.2 +/- 5.2 ) who participated in Q13308 challenge test . Nine gene-candidates , including 5-HTTLPR , P21397 VNTR , Q8IWU9 rs1386494 , 5- P08908 -1019C-G , 5- P28223 102T-C , CCKR1 246G-A , CCKR2 -215C-A , P21728 -94G-A and P21964 Val158Met , were selected for genotyping based on previous positive findings from genetic association studies in PD . After Q13308 challenge , 39 ( 35.5 % ) subjects experienced a panic attack , while 71 subjects were defined as non-panickers . We detected significant differences for both genotypic and allelic frequencies of 1386494A/G polymorphism in Q8IWU9 gene between panic and non-panic groups with the frequencies of G/G genotype and G allele significantly higher in panickers . None of the other candidate loci were significantly associated with Q13308 -induced panic attacks in healthy subjects . In line with our previous association study in patients with PD , we detected a possible association between Q8IWU9 rs1386494 polymorphism and susceptibility to panic attacks . Other polymorphisms previously associated with PD were unrelated to Q13308 -induced panic attacks , probably due to the differences between complex nature of PD and laboratory panic model .
