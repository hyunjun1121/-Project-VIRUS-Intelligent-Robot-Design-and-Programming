DB09210 defines a new binding site for allosteric modulators of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid ( AMPA ) receptors . Glutamate receptors are the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the vertebrate central nervous system and are important potential drug targets for cognitive enhancement and the treatment of schizophrenia . Allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors promote dimerization by binding to a dimer interface and reducing desensitization and deactivation . The pyrrolidine allosteric modulators , piracetam and aniracetam , were among the first of this class of drugs to be discovered . We have determined the structure of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtypes P42262 and P42263 with piracetam and a corresponding structure of P42263 with aniracetam . Both drugs bind to P42262 and P42263 in a very similar manner , suggesting little subunit specificity . However , the binding sites for piracetam and aniracetam differ considerably . DB04599 binds to a symmetrical site at the center of the dimer interface . DB09210 binds to multiple sites along the dimer interface with low occupation , one of which is a unique binding site for potential allosteric modulators . This new site may be of importance in the design of new allosteric regulators .
