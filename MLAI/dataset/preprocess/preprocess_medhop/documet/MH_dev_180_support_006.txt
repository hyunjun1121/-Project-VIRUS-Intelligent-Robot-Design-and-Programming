P04279 -110 and entinostat therapy reduces lung tumor burden and reprograms the epigenome . The DNA methyltransferase ( P26358 ) inhibitor vidaza ( DB00928 ) in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat has shown promise in treating lung cancer and this has been replicated in our orthotopic lung cancer model . However , the effectiveness of P26358 inhibitors against solid tumors is likely impacted by their limited stability and rapid inactivation by cytidine deaminase ( P32320 ) in the liver . These studies were initiated to test the efficacy of P04279 -110 , a dinucleotide containing decitabine that is resistant to deamination by P32320 , as a single agent and in combination with entinostat . Evaluation of in vivo plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic properties of P04279 -110 showed rapid conversion to decitabine and a plasma half-life of 4 hr . P04279 -110 alone or in combination with entinostat reduced tumor burden of a K-ras/p53 mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line ( Calu6 ) engrafted orthotopically in nude rats by 35 % and 56 % , respectively . P04279 -110 caused widespread demethylation of more than 300 gene promoters and microarray analysis revealed expression changes for 212 and 592 genes with P04279 -110 alone or in combination with entinostat . Epigenetic therapy also induced demethylation and expression of cancer testis antigen genes that could sensitize tumor cells to subsequent immunotherapy . In the orthotopically growing tumors , highly significant gene expression changes were seen in key cancer regulatory pathways including induction of P38936 and the apoptotic gene Q13323 . Moreover , P04279 -110 in combination with entinostat caused widespread epigenetic reprogramming of Q15910 -target genes . These preclinical in vivo findings demonstrate the clinical potential of P04279 -110 for reducing lung tumor burden through reprogramming the epigenome .
