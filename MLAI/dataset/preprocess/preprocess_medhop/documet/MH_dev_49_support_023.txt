cDNA array analysis of cytobrush-collected normal and malignant cervical epithelial cells : a feasibility study . Analysis of gene expression pattern is a useful approach to evaluating the biological behavior and clinical outcome of several human malignancies . Differentially expressed genes in malignant squamous cervical cells and the feasibility of gene expression profiling on squamous cervical cells obtained from cervical swabs were investigated . Cervical squamous cells from three women with high-risk human papilloma virus ( HR-HPV ) positive invasive squamous cervical carcinoma and from three HPV-negative women with normal ectocervical smears were analyzed with cDNA array . Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect the proteins corresponding to the highest upregulated genes with cDNA array . mRNA expression of P04626 , P10721 , P17948 , P04198 , DB01367 , CDKN2A , P24385 , P15531 , P22392 , MET , P21781 , P21802 , and P42224 was increased in malignant samples . Several expressed genes associated with antiapoptosis ( such as P10415 ) , cell structuring , or cell attachment were also upregulated in carcinoma cells . Decreased gene expression was observed for members of the transforming growth factor receptor superfamily ( TGF ) and integrin family , interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) , and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) . This study shows the feasibility of gene expression profiling of cervical squamous cells obtained with cytobrushes by identifying a characteristic gene expression pattern that clearly distinguishes between malignant and normal cervical epithelia of squamous type . We hypothesize that this noninvasive technique could be used in the evaluation of ambiguous Papanicolaou ( PAP ) smears .
