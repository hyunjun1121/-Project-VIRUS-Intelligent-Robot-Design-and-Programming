Effects of baicalein on apoptosis , cell cycle arrest , migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells . Baicalein is a bioactive flavonoid that is widely used in ancient China . However , its effects on the most common primary malignant bone tumor , osteosarcoma , remain unknown . In the present study , we investigated the effects of baicalein in osteosarcoma cells . Our results indicate baicalein might be an efficacious anti-osteosarcoma drug . We found that baicalein could inhibit cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner . Additionally , we demonstrated that baicalein promotes osteosarcoma cell apoptosis , and our mechanistic studies suggest that this is mediated by caspase activation , especially caspase-3 . We also showed that the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and concurrent increase in Bax and Bim levels contribute to the apoptosis induced by baicalein . In addition , we observed that baicalein induces P55008 cell cycle arrest by decreasing cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( P11802 ) . Furthermore , our data verifies that baicalein can reduce osteosarcoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion in vitro , which indicates its potential to inhibit osteosarcoma metastasis . The decrease in expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -2 and P14780 may contribute to the effects of baicalein . Taken together , our results provide evidence that baicalein plays important roles in anti-osteosarcoma therapy , and thus may serve as a novel and efficient candidate agent for osteosarcoma treatment .
