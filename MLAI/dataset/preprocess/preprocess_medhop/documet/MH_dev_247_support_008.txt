Q14703 lyase in thymic perivascular spaces promotes egress of mature thymocytes via up-regulation of P21453 . DB03203 1-phosphate ( Q14703 ) and P21453 ( P21453 ) play an important role in the egress of mature P01730 or CD8 single-positive ( SP ) thymocytes from the thymus . DB08868 hydrochloride ( FTY720 ) , an P21453 functional antagonist , induced significant accumulation of CD62L(high) Q07108 (low) mature SP thymocytes in the thymic medulla . Immunohistochemical staining using anti- P21453 antibody revealed that P21453 is predominantly expressed on thymocytes in the thymic medulla and is strongly down-regulated even at 3h after FTY720 administration . 2-Acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole ( THI ) , an Q14703 lyase inhibitor , also induced accumulation of mature SP thymocytes in the thymic medulla with an enlargement of the perivascular spaces ( P15151 ) . At 6h after THI administration , P21453 -expressing thymocytes reduced partially as if to form clusters and hardly existed in the proximity of CD31-expressing blood vessels in the thymic medulla , suggesting Q14703 lyase expression in the cells constructing thymic medullary P15151 . To determine the cells expressing Q14703 lyase in the thymus , we newly established a mAb ( YK19-2 ) specific for mouse Q14703 lyase . Immunohistochemical staining with YK19-2 revealed that Q14703 lyase is predominantly expressed in non-lymphoid thymic stromal cells in the thymic medulla . In the thymic medullary P15151 , Q14703 lyase was expressed in ER-TR7-positive cells ( reticular fibroblasts and pericytes ) and CD31-positive vascular endothelial cells . Our findings suggest that Q14703 lyase expressed in the thymic medullary P15151 keeps the tissue Q14703 concentration low around the vessels and promotes thymic egress via up-regulation of P21453 .
