Modulation of proteolytic activity during neuritogenesis in the PC12 nerve cell : differential control of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor activities by nerve growth factor and dibutyryl-cyclic AMP . Extracellular proteolysis is considered to be required during neuritic outgrowth to control the adhesiveness between the growing neurite membrane and extracellular matrix proteins . In this work , PC12 nerve cells were used to study the modulation of proteolytic activity during neuronal differentiation . PC12 cells were found to contain and release a 70-75-kDa tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) and a much less abundant 48-kDa urokinase-type plasminogen activator . A plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) activity with molecular sizes of 54 and 58 kDa was also detected in PC12 cell conditioned medium and formed high-molecular-mass complexes with released tPA . Release of P05121 activity was dependent on treatment with nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) , whereas tPA synthesis and release were under control of a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism and increased on treatment with dibutyryl-cyclic AMP [ (But)2cAMP ] or cholera toxin . Simultaneous treatment with P01138 and (But)2cAMP resulted in increases of both tPA and P05121 release and enhancement of tPA- P05121 complex formation . The resulting plasminogen activator activity in conditioned medium was high in (But)2cAMP-treated cultures with short neuritic outgrowth but remained low in P01138 - or P01138 plus (But)2cAMP-treated cultures , where neurite extension was , respectively , large and very large . These results suggest that excess proteolytic activity may be detrimental to neuritic outgrowth and that not only P05121 release but also tPA- P05121 complex formation is associated with production of large and stable neuritic outgrowth . This can be understood as an involvement of P05121 in the protection against neurite-destabilizing proteolytic activity .
