New targeted therapies in gastrointestinal cancers . Despite surgical , radiotherapeutic , and chemotherapeutic advances , a large proportion of gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancers remain incurable . An improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer has promulgated the development of novel agents designed to target critical pathways involved in cancer development and progression . The crucial role of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) in tumor proliferation and the overexpression of P00533 in several GI cancers provides the rationale for targeting and interrupting this key signaling network . P00533 blockade through monoclonal antibodies ( C225 and DB01269 ) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( ZD1839 and DB00530 ) has translated into promising evidence of clinical benefit . Ras-mediated signal transduction has been targeted using inhibitors of farnesyl transferase ( R115777 and SCH66336 ) to block the post-translation modification of Ras . Inhibitors of vascular growth factor receptor ( bevacizumab and PTK787 ) and matrix metalloproteinase target the effects of the host environment . P35354 inhibitors in colorectal cancer and STI571 in GI stromal tumors represent novel therapies of interest for these specific GI cancers . Evidence suggests that novel agents can be administered alone or in combination with standard therapies with little additional toxicity . The results of ongoing and future research efforts will clarify the optimal use and survival benefit of targeted therapies for patients with GI malignancies .
