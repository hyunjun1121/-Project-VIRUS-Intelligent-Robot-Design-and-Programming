A phase 1 study of weekly dosing of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) in patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor 2-positive breast cancer . BACKGROUND : We conducted a phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study ( TDM3569g ) to assess the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) administered weekly and once every 3 weeks in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab . The weekly dose results are described here . METHODS : Patients were administered escalating doses of DB05773 weekly , starting at 1.2 mg/kg . Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) to better characterize tolerability and pharmacokinetics . RESULTS : Twenty-eight patients received weekly DB05773 , and the MTD was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg . In general , DB05773 was well tolerated , requiring few dose modifications or discontinuations because of adverse events ( AEs ) . Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 19 patients ( 67.9 % ) ; treatment-related AEs occurred in 25 ( 89.3 % ) patients . Exposure to weekly DB05773 was dose-proportional at ≥ 1.2 mg/kg , and accumulation of DB05773 and total trastuzumab was observed . Objective partial tumor responses were reported in 13 ( 46.4 % ) patients ; the median duration of response was 18.6 months , and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 57.1 % . CONCLUSION : The results suggest that a weekly dose of DB05773 2.4 mg/kg has antitumor activity and is well tolerated in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer .
