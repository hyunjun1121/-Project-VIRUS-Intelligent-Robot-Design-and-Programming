Pharmacokinetics of the novel P25116 antagonist vorapaxar in patients with hepatic impairment . PURPOSE : To determine whether hepatic impairment has an effect on the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of vorapaxar or M20 , its main pharmacologically active metabolite . METHODS : This was an open-label study in which a single 40-mg oral dose of vorapaxar was administered to patients with mild ( n = 6 ) , moderate ( n = 6 ) , and severe ( n = 4 ) hepatic impairment and healthy controls ( n = 16 ) matched for age , gender , weight , and height . Blood samples for vorapaxar and M20 assay were collected predose and at frequent intervals up to 8 weeks postdose . RESULTS : Plasma vorapaxar and M20 PK profiles were similar between patients with impaired liver function and healthy controls . Group mean values for vorapaxar C(max) and AUC(tf) were 206-279 ng/mL and 14,200-18,200 ngÂ·h/mL , respectively , with the lowest values observed in patients with severe impairment . DB09030 median T(max) and mean t(1/2) values were 1.00-1.75 h and 298-366 h , respectively . There was no apparent correlation between vorapaxar or M20 exposure or t(1/2) values and disease severity . DB09030 was generally well tolerated ; one serious adverse event ( gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to ruptured esophageal varices ) was reported in a patient with severe hepatic impairment . CONCLUSIONS : Hepatic impairment had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of vorapaxar and M20 . No dose or dosage adjustment of vorapaxar will be required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment . Although systemic exposure to vorapaxar does not appear to increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment , administration of vorapaxar to such patients is not recommended given their bleeding diathesis .
