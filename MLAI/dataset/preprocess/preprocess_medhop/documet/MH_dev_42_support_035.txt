DB09301 glycosaminoglycans as major P16109 ligands on metastatic breast cancer cell lines . The metastatic breast cancer cell line , 4T1 , abundantly expresses the oligosaccharide sialylated Lewis x ( sLe(x) ) . SLe(x) oligosaccharide on tumor cells can be recognized by E- and P16109 , contributing to tumor metastatic process . We observed that both selectins reacted with this cell line . However , contrary to the P16581 reactivity , which was sLe(x) dependent , P16109 reactivity with this cell line was sLe(x)-independent . The sLe(x)-Neg variant of the 4T1 cell line with markedly diminished expression of sLe(x) and lack of sLe(a) , provided a unique opportunity to characterize P16109 ligands and their contribution to metastasis in the absence of overlapping selectin ligands and P16581 binding . We observed that P16109 binding was Ca(2+)-independent and sulfation-dependent . We found that P16109 reacted primarily with cell surface chondroitin sulfate ( CS ) proteoglycans , which were abundantly and stably expressed on the surface of the 4T1 cell line . P16109 binding to the 4T1 cells was inhibited by heparin and CS glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . Moreover , DB01109 administration significantly inhibited experimental lung metastasis . In addition , the data suggest that surface CS GAG chains were involved in P16109 mediated adhesion of the 4T1 cells to murine platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells . The data suggest that CS GAGs are also the major P16109 -reactive ligands on the surface of human MDA-MET cells . The results warrant conducting clinical studies on the involvement of cell surface CS chains in breast cancer metastasis and evaluation of various CS types and their biosynthetic pathways as target for development of treatment strategies for antimetastatic therapy of this disease .
