Involvement of cannabinoid receptors in inflammatory hypersensitivity to colonic distension in rats . Activation of cannabinoid P21554 and CB2 receptors is known to attenuate nociception and hyperalgesia in somatic inflammatory conditions . The aim of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids modulate colonic sensitivity in basal and inflammatory conditions . The effects of P21554 and CB2 receptor agonists and antagonists on the abdominal contractile response to colorectal distension ( CRD ) in basal conditions and after 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid-induced colitis were investigated . As previously described , colitis triggered a hypersensitivity to CRD . In basal conditions , both P21554 ( Q08050 55212-2 ) and CB2 ( JWH 015 ) agonists reduced the abdominal response to CRD at a dose of 1 mg kg(-1) , i.p . Both compounds were active at a lower dose ( 0.1 mg kg(-1) ) abolishing the hypersensitivity induced by colitis . Administered alone , P21554 ( DB06155 ) and CB2 ( SR 144528 ) receptor antagonists ( 10 mg kg(-1) ) had no effect on basal sensitivity . In contrast , the P21554 , but not the CB2 , receptor antagonist enhanced colitis-induced hyperalgesia . It is concluded that colonic inflammation enhances the antinociceptive action of P21554 and CB2 receptor agonists , and activates an endogenous , P21554 receptor mediated , antinociceptive pathway .
