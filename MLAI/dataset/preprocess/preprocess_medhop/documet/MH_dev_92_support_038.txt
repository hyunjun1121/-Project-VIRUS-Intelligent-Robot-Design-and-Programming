Effect of the IkBα mutant gene delivery to DB05914 on rat chronic pancreatitis . This study aimed to investigate the effect of inhibitors of the NF-kΒ alpha mutant gene ( IkBaM ) delivery to mensenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) on rat chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) . A total of 120 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 20 : Group A was injected with sterile saline solution , Group B was injected with allogenic MSCs , Group C1 was injected with allogenic IkBαM-MSCs cultured in vitro 4 h before CP modeling , Group P06681 was injected with allogenic IkBαM-MSCs cultured in vitro during CP modeling , Group P01024 was cultured with allogenic IkBαM-MSCs cultured in vitro 4 h after CP modeling , and Group D was injected with rAAV2-MSCs . Cytokine levels of P05362 , P29279 , IL-1 , P05231 , P10145 , P01375 -α , P01033 , P16035 , P22301 , FN , P03956 , P08253 , P08254 , and P14780 were examined . The results indicated that allogenic IκBαM-MSCs could reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and increase anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in CP . The allogenic IkBαM-MSCs reduced the activation and promoted the apoptosis of pancreatic stellate cells in the rat model of CP . IkBαM-MSCs influenced the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic stellate cells by regulating the activation of the Q07869 , MAPK , P42345 , TGF-β , NOD-like receptor , Notch , WNT , TGF-β1-SMAD-2/3 , and P04637 signal transduction pathways .
