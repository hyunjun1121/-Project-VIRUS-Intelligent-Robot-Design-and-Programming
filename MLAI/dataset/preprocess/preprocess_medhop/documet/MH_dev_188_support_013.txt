A general method for the synthesis of aryl [11C]methylsulfones : potential PET probes for imaging cyclooxygenase-2 expression . A general one-pot method has been developed for the conversion of an aryl thiol moiety masked as the butyrate ester to the corresponding 11C-labeled methylsulfone group . The potential of this methodology has been demonstrated by the successful radiosynthesis of carbon-11 analogues of several highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors such as DB00533 , DB01628 , and 3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethyl isoxazole in high yield . The chemical and radiochemical purities obtained for the 11C-labeled P35354 inhibitors are > 99 % with a specific activity > 1000 Ci/mmol .
