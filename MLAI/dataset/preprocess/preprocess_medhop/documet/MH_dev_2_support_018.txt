Can P35354 inhibitor-induced increase in cardiovascular disease risk be modified by essential fatty acids ? Selective P35354 inhibitors increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke . This has been attributed to their ability to inhibit endothelial P35354 derived prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) but not platelet P23219 derived thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) . On the other hand , aspirin blocks both P23219 and P35354 enzymes without decreasing DB01240 but blocks TXA2 synthesis that explains its beneficial action in the prevention of coronary heart disease ( Q8NE62 ) . The inhibitory action of aspirin on P23219 and P35354 enzymes enhances the tissue concentrations of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DB00154 ) , arachidonic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) . These fatty acids form precursors to PGE1 , DB01240 , PGI3 , lipoxins ( LXs ) , and resolvins that have anti-inflammatory actions . In contrast , increase in the concentrations of DB00154 , AA , EPA , and DB01708 is much less with specific P35354 inhibitors since they do not block the formation of eicosanoids through P23219 pathway . P35354 inhibitors interfere with the formation of LXs and resolvins that have neuroprotective and cardioprotective actions . EPA and DB01240 have anti-arrhythmic action . EPA , DB01708 , and AA augment eNO formation that prevents atherosclerosis . This suggests that P35354 inhibitors increase cardiovascular and stroke risk by interfering with the formation of eNO , DB01240 , LXs , and resolvins and implies that combining EFAs with P35354 inhibitors could prevent these complications .
