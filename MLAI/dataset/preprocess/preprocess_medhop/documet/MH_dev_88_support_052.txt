The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant blocks both mammary gland development and MCF-7 breast cancer xenograft growth . Mammary gland development is dependent upon the growth hormone ( GH ) /insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) axis , this same axis has also been implicated in breast cancer progression . In this study we investigated the effect of a GH antagonist , pegvisomant ( Somavert , Pfizer ) , on normal mammary gland development and breast cancer xenograft growth . Intraperitoneal administration of pegvisomant resulted in a 60 % suppression of hepatic P05019 mRNA levels and upto a 70-80 % reduction of serum P05019 levels . DB00082 administration to virgin female mice caused a significant delay of mammary ductal outgrowth that was associated with a decrease in the number of terminal end buds and reduced branching and complexity of the gland . This effect of pegvisomant was mediated by a complete inhibition of both GH and IGF-IR-mediated signaling within the gland . In breast cancer xenograft studies , pegvisomant caused shrinkage of MCF-7 xenografts , with an initial 30 % reduction in tumor volume , which was associated with a 2-fold reduction in proliferation and a 2-fold induction of apoptosis . Long-term growth inhibition of MCF-7 xenografts was noted . In contrast , pegvisomant had no effect on MDA-231 or MDA-435 xenografts , consistent with primary growth of these xenografts being unresponsive to P05019 both in vitro and in vivo . In MCF-7 xenografts that regressed , pegvisomant had only minor effects upon P10912 and IGF-IR signaling . This data supports previous studies indicating a role for GH/IGF in mammary gland development , and suggests that pegvisomant maybe useful for the prevention and/or treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer .
