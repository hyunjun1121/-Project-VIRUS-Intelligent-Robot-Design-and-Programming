DB08916 and lung cancer . P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( P00533 -TKI ) have an established role in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . First-generation reversible DB00171 -competitive P00533 -TKIs are approved for the initial treatment of patients with P00533 mutation-positive advanced NSCLC . DB08916 is an irreversible second-generation P00533 -TKI with potent preclinical activity against P00533 ( wild type and mutant ) , P04626 , Q15303 and P00533 -mutant NSCLC with acquired resistance to reversible P00533 -TKI . LUX-Lung 3 trial demonstrated superiority of afatinib to cisplatin and pemetrexed in the frontline treatment of treatment-na√Øve patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung and P00533 mutation . Based on these results , afatinib was recently approved for the first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with P00533 mutation . This article summarizes current status of preclinical and clinical development of afatinib in NSCLC .
