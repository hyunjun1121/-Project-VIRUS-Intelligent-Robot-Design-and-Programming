Analgesic and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Methanol Extract of Cissus repens in Mice . The aim of this study was to investigate possible analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the CR(MeOH) . Analgesic effect was evaluated in two models including acetic acid-induced writhing response and formalin-induced paw licking . The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by λ-carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema and histopathologic analyses . The results showed that CR(MeOH) ( 500 mg/kg ) decreased writhing response in the acetic acid assay and licking time in the formalin test . CR(MeOH) ( 100 and 500 mg/kg ) significantly decreased edema paw volume at 4th to 5th hours after λ-carrageenan had been injected . Histopathologically , CR(MeOH) abated the level of tissue destruction and swelling of the edema paws . These results were indicated that anti-inflammatory mechanism of CR(MeOH) may be due to declined levels of NO and MDA in the edema paw through increasing the activities of SOD , GPx , and GRd in the liver . Additionally , CR(MeOH) also decreased IL-1β , P05231 , NFκB , P01375 -α , P35354 , and P35228 levels . The contents of two active ingredients , ursolic acid and lupeol , were quantitatively determined . This paper demonstrated possible mechanisms for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CR(MeOH) and provided evidence for the classical treatment of Cissus repens in inflammatory diseases .
