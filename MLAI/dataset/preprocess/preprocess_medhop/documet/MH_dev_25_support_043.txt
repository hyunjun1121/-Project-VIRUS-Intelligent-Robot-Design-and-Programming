Chronic induction . What 's new in the pipeline . Induction therapy with biological agents was introduced the in the 1970s and the rationale , concepts and approach have remained almost unchanged for 30 years . However , the novel biological agents being developed for induction therapy are being designed for chronic rather than short-term therapy with several objectives : reduce dependence on toxic and nephrotoxic agents , improve outcome and ultimately facilitate the emergence of tolerance . The biological agents include efalizumab , a humanized anti-CD11a ( anti-LFA1 ) , anti- CD154 , anti- P25942 , a number of agents targeting P40933 and its receptor , and costimulation blockade with humanized antibodies to P33681 / P42081 and the fusion receptor protein DB06681 , a second generation DB01281 . The past decade has witnessed an unprecedented number of small molecules/oral drugs that have been developed and approved for renal transplantation ; the next decade , however , may witness the emergence of a new class of biological induction agents that may displace some of the currently used drugs .
