Apoptogenic interactions of plasmalemmal type-1 P21796 and Aβ peptides via GxxxG motifs induce Alzheimer 's disease - a basic model of apoptosis ? Human type-1 porin/ P21796 ( voltage-dependent anion channel ) carries a GxxxG motif in its N-terminal part , traversing the β-barrel , while the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) relevant amyloid peptides Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 show a series of corresponding motifs close to their C-terminus . GxxxG motifs are established as aggregation/membrane perturbation motifs . These peptide primary structure data support a proposal I recently made on the basis of a synopsis of recent literature . Accordingly , amyloid Aβ , cut from P05067 by beta-secretase P56817 and gamma-secretase , has been insinuated to induce Alzheimer 's disease via apoptosis by opening type-1 porin/ P21796 in cell membranes of hypometabolic neuronal cells . Considering the ubiquitous expression modus of P05067 , beta- and gamma-secretases and type-1 P21796 /eukaryotic porin a basic model of apoptosis might be given .
