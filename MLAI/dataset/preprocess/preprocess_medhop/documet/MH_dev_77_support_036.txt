Development of a fusion protein SNVP as substrate for assaying multi-serotype botulinum neurotoxins . The SNARE super family has three core members , namely P60880 , P63027 , and syntaxin . P60880 is cleaved by botulinum toxins ( BoNTs ) /A , /C , and /E , whereas P63027 is the substrate for proteolytic BoNTs/B , /D , /F , and /G . In this study , we constructed a hybrid gene encoding the fusion protein SNVP that encompasses P60880 residues Met1 to Gly206 and P63027 residues Met1 to Lys94 . The hybrid gene was cloned in a prokaryotic vector carrying an N-terminal pelB signal sequence and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta . To easily purify the protein , 6Ã— DB00117 double-affinity tags were designed as the linker and C terminus of the fusion protein . SNVP was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a HisTrap FF column and determined to be more than 97 % pure by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein showed that signal peptide was successfully removed . The fusion protein SNVP contained the protease cleavage sites of all seven serotypes of BoNTs . SNVP was also proved to be recognized and cleaved by the endopeptidase of BoNTs ( DB00083 -LC , BoNT/B-LC , BoNT/E-LC , and BoNT/G-LC ) . The novel fusion substrate SNVP exhibited high biological activity under the optimal conditions , suggesting its potential use as a reagent for BoNT assay .
