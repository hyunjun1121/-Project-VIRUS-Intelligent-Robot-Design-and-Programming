DB00067 decreases sepsis-induced pulmonary inflammation through the P30518 . The early use of vasopressors in sepsis has been associated with a decrease in immune activation independent of hemodynamic effects , although the mechanism behind this remains unclear . We hypothesize that low dose vasopressin will reduce the pulmonary inflammation associated with sepsis . Our aims were to ( 1 ) determine whether vasopressin reduces lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced pulmonary inflammation and ( 2 ) determine which vasopressin receptor is responsible for pulmonary immune modulation . Mice were treated with intraperitoneal LPS to induce both systemic and pulmonary inflammation . DB00067 or saline was infused via peritoneal pump and interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) in lung and serum was measured at 6h . NF-kappaB activation as was determined in the lung through immunoblotting total and phospho-IkappaB . Hemodynamic data was also obtained at the 6h mark . In a separate series of experiments mice received both LPS and vasopressin infusion following pretreatment with vasopressin receptor antagonists to V1R , P30518 and OTR . Low dose LPS dramatically raises both serum P05231 and pulmonary levels of P05231 and phospho-IkappaB despite no significant changes in mean arterial pressure at 6h . Compared to saline , vasopressin infusion significantly decreases both the pulmonary P05231 levels and phospho-IkappaB in LPS treated mice without raising arterial pressure . Pretreatment with P30518 antagonist results in complete attenuation of vasopressin 's immunosuppressive effects , with restoration of pulmonary P05231 and phospho-IkappaB levels to those seen with LPS alone . CONCLUSIONS : DB00067 exerts a local anti-inflammatory effect on the lung through the P30518 in a model of sepsis .
