Responses to subsequent anti- P04626 therapy after treatment with trastuzumab-DM1 in women with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . BACKGROUND : Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) can respond to multiple lines of anti- P04626 therapy . It is unknown whether these patients will derive further clinical benefit following treatment with trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 ( DB05773 ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : We retrospectively identified P04626 -positive MBC patients treated with DB05773 and characterized outcomes during subsequent lines of anti- P04626 therapy . Response was determined by a blinded radiology review . Time-dependent analyses were carried out using Kaplan-Meier estimates . RESULTS : We identified 23 patients treated with single-agent DB05773 and report on the 20 patients who discontinued protocol therapy . All patients received trastuzumab-based metastatic therapy before initiation of DB05773 [ median 7 regimens ( range 3-14 ) ] . Of these 20 patients , 75 % ( 15 of 20 ) received further therapy with or without anti- P04626 agents after discontinuing DB05773 . Partial response to either first- or second-subsequent line(s) of therapy was seen in 5 of 15 ( 33 % ) treated patients , including 33 % ( 4 of 12 ) who received a regimen containing trastuzumab and/or lapatinib . Median durations of therapy to first- and second-subsequent regimens after DB05773 were 5.5 and 6.4 months , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : In heavily pretreated P04626 -positive MBC patients , prior exposure to DB05773 does not exhaust the potential benefit of ongoing anti- P04626 therapy with trastuzumab- and/or lapatinib-based regimens .
