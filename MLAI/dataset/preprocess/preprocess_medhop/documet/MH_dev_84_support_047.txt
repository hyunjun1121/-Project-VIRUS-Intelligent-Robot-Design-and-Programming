Genes controlling spread of breast cancer to lung " gang of 4 " . Cancer-related mortality is caused in a large part by the metastasis of primary tumor . Each cancer has a particular way of spreading cancerous cells . Recently , genetic and pharmacological analysis identified the set of genes , such as epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin ( O14944 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2 ( P03956 and P08253 ) that have been found to be associated with metastasis of breast cancer to lung . Inhibition of P00533 and P35354 could minimize lung metastasis of breast cancer in a clinical setting . In this review , we summarized the current knowledge on O14944 , P35354 , P03956 and P08253 in tumor development and metastasis .
