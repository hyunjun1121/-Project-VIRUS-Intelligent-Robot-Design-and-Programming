Are rofecoxib and celecoxib safer NSAIDS ? NSAIDs work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) , responsible for prostaglandin synthesis . This enzyme exists in two isoforms , P23219 and P35354 . Inhibition of P23219 is thought to be the main cause of the gastrointestinal unwanted effects of NSAIDs , whilst inhibition of P35354 results in anti-inflammatory effects . [ symbol : see text ] DB00533 ( Vioxx -- MSD ) and [ symbol : see text ] celecoxib ( DB00482 -- Searle ) have been developed as selective inhibitors of P35354 . DB00533 is licensed for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis , but not for rheumatoid arthritis . The manufacturer claims that " in clinical studies rofecoxib inhibits P35354 but not P23219 " , has " the power of high-dose NSAIDs -- diclofenac and ibuprofen " and " superior GI safety profile compared to conventional NSAIDs " . Celecoxib is licensed for symptom relief in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . The manufacturer claims that celecoxib has " comparable efficacy and superior GI tolerability when compared to diclofenac or naproxen " . Here , we review rofecoxib and celecoxib and consider whether they are safer than conventional NSAIDs .
