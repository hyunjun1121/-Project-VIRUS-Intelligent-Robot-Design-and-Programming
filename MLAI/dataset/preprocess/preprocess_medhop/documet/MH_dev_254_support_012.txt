Reaction of phenylglyoxal with arginine groups in P14920 from Rhodotorula gracilis . D-Amino-acid oxidase from Rhodotorula gracilis was irreversibly inactivated by phenylglyoxal in a biphasic process . The fast phase was completed in less than 1 min . Its extent was linearly dependent on phenylglyoxal concentration and was not influenced by the presence of DB03147 or benzoate , a pseudo-substrate . The second phase of inactivation was due to a simple second-order reaction . The presence of DB03147 exerted only partial protection ; the second-order rate constants of inactivation were 8.3 M-1 min-1 for holoprotein and 18.0 M-1 min-1 for apoprotein . The addition of benzoate completely protected against this second phase of inactivation . Efforts to isolate the enzyme modified at a single arginine residue at the end of the fast phase were unsuccessful , but analysis of the enzyme isolated at the end of the slow phase identified an arginine residue , protected by benzoate , that is highly conserved in all D-amino-acid oxidases and corresponds to Arg283 in the pig kidney enzyme . Modification of this residue is directly involved in the inactivation process during the slow phase . This arginine may represent the basic residue ion pairing with the carboxylate group of the substrate or the residue interacting with the flavin N1- P06681 = O locus .
