P06401 modulator DB05366 induces extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells . Effects of progesterone receptor modulator DB05366 on the expression of the extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) components were examined in cultured human uterine leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Q13201 metalloproteinase inducer ( P35613 ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , tissue inhibitors of MMP ( TIMPs ) and collagen levels were assessed by Western blot analysis , MMP activity assay and real-time RT-PCR . RNA interference ( RNAi ) of P35613 was performed using small interfering mRNA . In cultured leiomyoma cells , DB05366 treatment at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-8) M significantly increased P35613 , P03956 and P22894 protein contents and P03956 , P08253 , P08254 and P14780 mRNA levels , and activity of P03956 , P08253 , P08254 and P14780 in the medium . P01033 and P16035 were significantly decreased at mRNA and protein levels by DB05366 treatment at concentrations > or =10(-7) M in these cells . DB05366 treatment decreased types I and III collagen protein contents . However , DB05366 treatment did not affect the Q13201 component expression in cultured myometrial cells . RNAi of P35613 abrogated DB05366 -mediated both induction of MMPs and reduction of TIMPs and collagens in cultured leiomyoma cells . These results suggest that DB05366 modulates the expression of P35613 , MMPs , TIMPs and collagens in cultured leiomyoma cells without comparable effects on myometrial cells .
