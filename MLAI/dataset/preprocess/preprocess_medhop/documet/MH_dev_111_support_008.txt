Characteristics of early murine B-lymphocyte precursors and their direct sensitivity to negative regulators . Recently , a collection of surface markers was exploited to isolate viable Lin(-) TdT(+) cells from murine bone marrow . These early pro-B cells were enriched for B-lineage lymphocyte precursor activity measured by short-term culture and had little responsiveness to myeloid growth factors . Early precursors can be propagated with remarkably high cloning frequencies in stromal cell-free , serum-free cultures , permitting this analysis of direct regulatory factors . Expression of the interleukin-7 receptor ( IL-7Ralpha ) chain marks functional precursors and P13232 is necessary for progression beyond the CD45RA(+) P15391 (-) stage . Efficient survival and differentiation were only observed when stem cell factor and Flt-3 ligand were also present . P13232 -responsive P15391 (+) precursors are estrogen resistant . However , B-lineage differentiation was selectively abrogated when highly purified Lin(-) precursors were treated with hormone in the absence of stromal cells . In addition , early stages of B lymphopoiesis were arrested by limitin , a new interferon ( IFN ) -like cytokine as well as IFN-alpha , P01579 , or transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) , but not by epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . Lin(-) TdT(+) early pro-B cells are shown here to be P26842 (+) AA4.1(+/-)Ki-67(+) Ly-6C(-) Ly-6A/Sca-1(Lo/-)Thy-1(-) P16150 (+) P01730 (+/-)CD16/32(Lo/-) P16070 (Hi) and similar in some respects to the " common lymphoid progenitors " ( CLP ) identified by others . Although early pro-B cells have lost myeloid differentiation potential , transplantation experiments described here reveal that at least some can generate T lymphocytes . Of particular importance is the demonstration that a pivotal early stage of lymphopoiesis is directly sensitive to negative regulation by hormones and cytokines .
