DB01016 -induced apoptosis is specifically enhanced by expression of the sulfonylurea receptor isoform Q09428 but not by expression of SUR2B or the mutant Q09428 (M1289T) . Q09428 ( Q09428 ) is the regulatory subunit of the pancreatic DB00171 -sensitive K+ channel ( K( DB00171 ) channel ) , which is essential for triggering insulin secretion via membrane depolarization . Sulfonylureas , such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide , act as K( DB00171 ) channel blockers and are widely used in diabetes treatment . These antidiabetic substances are known to induce apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells or beta-cell lines under certain conditions . However , the precise molecular mechanisms of this sulfonylurea-induced apoptosis are still unidentified . To investigate the role of Q09428 in apoptosis induction , we tested the effect of glibenclamide on recombinant human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing either Q09428 , the smooth muscular isoform SUR2B , or the mutant Q09428 (M1289T) at which a single amino acid in transmembrane helix 17 ( TM17 ) was exchanged by the corresponding amino acid of SUR2 . By analyzing cell detachment , nuclear condensation , DNA fragmentation , and caspase-3-like activity , we observed a Q09428 -specific enhancement of glibenclamide-induced apoptosis that was not seen in SUR2B , Q09428 (M1289T) , or control cells . Coexpression with the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit did not significantly alter the apoptotic effect of glibenclamide on Q09428 cells . In conclusion , expression of Q09428 , but not of SUR2B or Q09428 (M1289T) , renders cells more susceptible to glibenclamide-induced apoptosis . Therefore , Q09428 as a pancreatic protein could be involved in specific variation of beta-cell mass and might also contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion at this level . According to our results , TM17 is essentially involved in Q09428 -mediated apoptosis . This effect does not require the presence of functional Kir6.2-containing K( DB00171 ) channels , which points to additional , so far unknown functions of Q09428 .
