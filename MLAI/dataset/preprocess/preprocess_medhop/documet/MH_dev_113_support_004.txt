DB00642 : its promise in treating non-small-cell lung cancer . The use of chemotherapy in the treatment of early and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) has increased during the past decade . One of the main reasons for the increased acceptance of chemotherapy is the development of several new cytotoxic agents with a unique mechanism(s) of action and high single-agent activity , combined with a favorable toxicity profile . DB00642 ( Alimta ) is a novel antifolate that inhibits several enzymes involved in DNA synthesis ( thymidylate synthase [ TS ] , dihydrofolate reductase [ P00374 ] , and glycinamide ribonucleotideformyltransferase [ GARFT ] ) . DB00642 's toxicity is markedly reduced by folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation . The compound has been studied extensively in various tumor types , including NSCLC . In NSCLC , pemetrexed at 500 mg/m2 , every 3 weeks , given i.v. over 10 minutes , has shown promising activity , and can safely be administrated with vitamin supplementation . After registration , single-agent pemetrexed will certainly add to the chemotherapeutic options available for pretreated patients and will most likely change significantly chemotherapy prescriptions in second-line chemotherapy . In first-line chemotherapy , the role of platinum-based and -free combination doublet chemotherapy with pemetrexed still needs to be defined . Phase II data indicate high efficacy combined with favorable toxicity for pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin , carboplatin ( DB00958 ) , oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) , gemcitabine ( Gemzar ) , and vinorelbine ( Navelbine ) . This review summarizes the clinical experience obtained thus far during the early clinical development of pemetrexed in NSCLC .
