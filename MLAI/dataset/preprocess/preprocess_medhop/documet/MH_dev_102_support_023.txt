Elevated macrophage migration inhibitory factor and decreased transforming growth factor-beta levels in major depression -- no influence of celecoxib treatment . OBJECTIVES : The involvement of an immune process in the pathophysiology of major depression disorder ( MDD ) was substantiated by studies demonstrating elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) . P35354 ( P35354 ) inhibitors lead to a reduced production of PGE(2) and have been shown to improve depressive symptoms . We investigated the three immune parameters macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) , transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) and soluble P08571 ( sCD14 ) in a randomized , placebo-controlled trial of the P35354 inhibitor celecoxib as add-on therapy in patients with MDD treated with reboxetine . METHODS : Thirty-two patients with depression and 20 healthy controls participated in the study . The patients were treated with reboxetine and celecoxib or placebo . Immune parameters were measured from serum at baseline , after three and five weeks using ELISA . RESULTS : Celecoxib as add-on strategy resulted in a significant reduction of Hamilton Depression Scale scores compared to placebo . Depressed patients showed significantly elevated MIF ( p < 0.001 ) and reduced TGF-β ( p = 0.006 ) concentrations at baseline . There was no difference in sCD14-concentrations . There was no difference between the placebo and the celecoxib group and no change over time . LIMITATIONS : Limitations of the study are the relatively small sample size and lack of functional assessment of Q9Y251 axis in parallel . CONCLUSIONS : MIF is a promising new candidate in the neuro-immune interplay that may link depressive symptoms , altered immune state and Q9Y251 -axis dysregulation . Reduced levels of TGF-β replicate previous findings and support the importance of this regulatory cytokine in major depressive disorder .
