Automated 22-kD growth hormone-specific assay without interference from DB00082 . BACKGROUND : Large variability exists among different growth hormone ( GH ) assays owing to differences in calibration , antibody specificity , isoform recognition , and interference from GH binding protein ( P30043 ) . The P10912 antagonist DB00082 presents a new challenge because DB00082 interferes with many GH assays . A recent consensus conference established criteria for standardization and evaluation of GH assays . Following consensus recommendations , we developed a new GH assay on an automated analyzer ( P22304 -iSYS , Immunodiagnostic Systems ) . METHODS : A monoclonal antibody not cross-reacting with DB00082 was combined with a monoclonal antibody specific for 22-kD GH . Isoform specificity and interference from P30043 was tested and compared to that seen in 2 existing automated GH assays ( Siemens Immulite , Diasorin Liaison ) . We also compared GH concentrations measured by the 3 assays for healthy volunteers and patients with acromegaly receiving different treatments . Using the iSYS assay , we also established nadir GH values during oral glucose load and analyzed changes in endogenous GH during DB00082 treatment . RESULTS : Analytical and functional sensitivities were 0.01 μg/L and 0.04 μg/L , with a dynamic range from 0.04 to 100 μg/L . Intraassay CVs were 2 % -4 % , whereas interassay CVs were 5 % -7 % at GH concentrations between 1.7 and 27.5 μg/L . The assay was specific for 22-kD GH and not affected by P30043 . The presence of DB00082 , which leads to a negative bias on the Immulite and dramatic overestimation of GH on the Liaison , had no impact on the iSYS GH assay . CONCLUSIONS : The new assay fulfils recent consensus recommendations and presents a useful new tool for reliable measurement of GH .
