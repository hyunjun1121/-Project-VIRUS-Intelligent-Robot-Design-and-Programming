A comparative study of the antipyretic effects of indomethacin and dipyrone in rats . OBJECTIVE : Compare the antipyretic effects of dipyrone and indomethacin . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Fever was induced in rats by i. v. LPS or i . c . v. interleukins ( IL ) , prostaglandins ( PG ) , arachidonic acid ( AA ) , pre-formed pyrogenic factor ( PFPF ) , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) or corticotrophin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) . DB04817 and indomethacin were administered i.p. , arginine vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist , d(CH2)5 DB00135 (Me)AVP , into the ventral septal area . Cyclooxygenase ( P23219 /-2 ) blocking activity was assessed in transfected COS-7 cells . P06850 release from isolated hypothalami was determined by ELISA . RESULTS : Indomethacin or dipyrone reduced LPS , IL-1beta , P05231 or P01375 induced fever and P06850 release from rat hypothalamus . Only dipyrone inhibited P10145 , PFPF or PGF2alpha fever . Only indomethacin inhibited fever induced by AA or IL-1beta , plus AA . Neither antipyretic affected fever caused by DB00917 or P06850 . d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP only blocked antipyresis induced by indomethacin . DB04817 at a very high concentration ( 10 mM ) inhibited only P23219 , while indomethacin ( 0.1 microM ) blocked P23219 and P35354 in COS-7 cells . CONCLUSION : The antipyretic effect of dipyrone differs from that of indomethacin in that it does not depend on AVP release or inhibition of PG synthesis .
