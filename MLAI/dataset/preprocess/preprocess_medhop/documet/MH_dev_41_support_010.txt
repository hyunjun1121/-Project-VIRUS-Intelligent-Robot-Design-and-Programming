Identification of campath-1 ( P31358 ) as novel drug target in neoplastic stem cells in 5q-patients with P43034 and AML . PURPOSE : The P31358 -targeted antibody alemtuzumab induces major clinical responses in a group of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) . The mechanism underlying this drug effect remains unknown . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We asked whether neoplastic stem cells ( NSC ) in patients with P43034 ( n = 29 ) or acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ; n = 62 ) express P31358 . RESULTS : As assessed by flow cytometry , P31358 was found to be expressed on NSC-enriched P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-) cells in 8/11 patients with P43034 and isolated del(5q) . In most other patients with P43034 , P31358 was weakly expressed or not detectable on NSC . In AML , P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-) cells displayed P31358 in 23/62 patients , including four with complex karyotype and del(5q) and one with del(5q) and t(1;17;X) . In quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analyses , purified NSC obtained from del(5q) patients expressed P31358 mRNA . We were also able to show that P31358 mRNA levels correlate with EVI1 expression and that P01111 induces the expression of P31358 in AML cells . The P31358 -targeting drug alemtuzumab , was found to induce complement-dependent lysis of P28906 (+)/ P28907 (-)/ P31358 (+) NSC , but did not induce lysis in P31358 (-) NSC . DB00087 also suppressed engraftment of P31358 (+) NSC in NSG mice . Finally , P31358 expression on NSC was found to correlate with a poor survival in patients with P43034 and AML . CONCLUSIONS : The cell surface target Campath-1 ( P31358 ) is expressed on NSC in a group of patients with P43034 and AML . P31358 is a novel prognostic NSC marker and a potential NSC target in a subset of patients with P43034 and AML , which may have clinical implications and may explain clinical effects produced by alemtuzumab in these patients .
