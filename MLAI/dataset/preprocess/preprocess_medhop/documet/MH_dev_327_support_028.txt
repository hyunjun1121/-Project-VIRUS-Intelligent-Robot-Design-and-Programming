Effects of DNA polymerase inhibitors on replicative and repair DNA synthesis in ultraviolet-irradiated HeLa cells . Aphidicolin specifically inhibits eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha , while 2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate ( d2TTP ) inhibits P06746 and gamma but not alpha . DB00987 5'-triphosphate ( araCTP ) inhibits both DNA polymerase alpha and beta although to a different extent . Here we measured the effects of these inhibitors on repair DNA synthesis of U.V.-irradiated HeLa cells by two different methods . Firstly , aphidicolin , 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine ( araC , a precursor of araCTP ) and 2',3'-dideoxythimidine ( d2Thd , a precursor of d2TTP ) were added directly to the culture medium . In this case , aphidicolin and araC strongly inhibited replicative DNA synthesis of HeLa cells , and they also inhibited repair synthesis after U.V.-irradiation but to a much lesser extent . In contrast , high concentrations of d2Thd inhibited repair DNA synthesis to a higher extent than replicative DNA synthesis . Secondly , the active form of inhibitor , d2TTP , was microinjection directly into cytoplasm or nuclei or U.V.-irradiated HeLa cells . Microinjection of d2TTP effectively inhibited repair synthesis . The microinjection of d2TTP , into either cytoplasm or nucleus , strongly inhibited replicative synthesis . These results might indicate that multiple DNA polymerases are involved in repair synthesis as well as in replicative synthesis .
