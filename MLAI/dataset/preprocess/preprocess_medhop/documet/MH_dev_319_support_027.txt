Rabbit anti-rat thymocyte immunoglobulin preserves renal function during ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat kidney transplantation . Ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury is an important cause of renal graft dysfunction in humans . Increases in cold and warm ischemia times lead to a higher risk of early post-transplant complications including delayed graft function and acute rejection . Moreover , prolonged cold ischemia is a predictor of long-term kidney graft loss . The protective effect of rabbit anti-rat thymocyte immunoglobulin ( DB00098 ) was evaluated in a rat model of I/R injury following syngeneic kidney transplantation . Serum creatinine concentration was evaluated at 16 h and 24 h post-transplant . Animals were sacrificed 24 h post-transplant for evaluation of histology , infiltrating leukocytes , nitrotyrosine staining , and apoptosis . DB00098 was effective in preventing renal function impairment , tissue damage and tubular apoptosis associated with I/R only when was given 2 h before transplantation but not at the time of reperfusion . Pretransplant DB00098 treatment of recipient animals effectively reduced the amount of macrophages , P01730 (+) , CD8(+) T cells and LFA-1(+) cells infiltrating renal graft subjected to cold ischemia as well as granzyme-B expression within ischemic kidney . On the other hand , granulocyte infiltration and oxidative stress were not modified by DB00098 . If these results will be translated into the clinical setting , pretransplant administration of Thymoglobuline(Â®) could offer the additional advantage over peri-transplant administration of limiting I/R-mediated kidney graft damage .
