Activation of farnesoid X receptor attenuates liver injury in systemic lupus erythematosus . To investigate the expression and effect of farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) on systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) liver dysfunction and indicate its hepatoprotective role and the immunomodulatory property . mRNA and protein levels of Q96RI1 were determined on the liver specimens of SLE patients with liver injury as well as MRL/lpr rodent models . The Q96RI1 agonist chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) was administrated to MRL/lpr mice and the control BALB/C with concanavalin A ( ConA ) -induced liver injury . Blood samples were taken 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , and 24 h after ConA injection for the detection of serum ALT , Q9NRA2 , IFN-γ , P01375 -α , and P05231 . Q96RI1 was down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the liver specimens of SLE patients with liver injury as well as MRL/lpr mice . MRL/lpr was more susceptible to ConA than BALB/C indicated by significantly higher levels of aminotransferase and inflammatory cytokines . Activation of Q96RI1 by DB06777 significantly reduced aminotransferase and inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ , P01375 -α , and P05231 caused by ConA injection in MRL/lpr mice . Q96RI1 was down-regulated in SLE patients as well as MRL/lpr lupus models with liver dysfunction . Q96RI1 activation ameliorated liver injury and suppressed inflammatory cytokines , thereby showing its protective function in SLE . Our findings raised the promising potential target for the treatment of SLE liver injury .
