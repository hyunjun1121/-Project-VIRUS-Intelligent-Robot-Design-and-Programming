Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors reduce human dendritic cell inflammatory cytokine production and Th1-polarizing capacity . Inhibitors of DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 4 have been shown to inhibit inflammatory mediator release and T cell proliferation , and are considered candidate therapies for T(h)1-mediated diseases . However , little is known about how DB05876 inhibitors influence dendritic cells ( DC ) , the cells responsible for the priming of naive T(h) cells . Therefore , we investigated the PDE profile of monocyte-derived DC , and whether DB05876 inhibitors modulate DC cytokine production and T cell-polarizing capacity . We mainly found DB02527 -specific DB05876 enzymatic activity in both immature and mature DC . In contrast to monocytes that mainly express Q07343 , we found that P27815 is the predominant DB05876 subtype present in DC . Immature DC showed reduced ability to produce IL-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha upon lipopolysaccharide or P29965 ( P29965 ) stimulation in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors , whereas cytokine production upon P29965 stimulation of fully mature DC in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors was not affected . Exposure to DB05876 inhibitors for 2 days during DC maturation did not influence T cell-stimulatory capacity or acquisition of a mature phenotype , but increased the expression of the chemokine receptor P61073 . Furthermore , DC matured in the presence of DB05876 inhibitors showed reduced capacity to produce IL-12p70 and P01375 upon subsequent P29965 stimulation . Using these DB05876 inhibitor-matured DC to stimulate naive T cells resulted in a reduction of P01579 -producing ( T(h)1 ) cells . These findings indicate that DB05876 inhibitors can affect T cell responses by acting at the DC level and may increase our understanding of the therapeutic implication of DB05876 inhibitors for T(h)1-mediated disorders .
