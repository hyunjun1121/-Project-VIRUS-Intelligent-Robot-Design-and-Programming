Effects of preset sequential administrations of sunitinib and everolimus on tumour differentiation in Caki-1 renal cell carcinoma . BACKGROUND : DB01268 ( VEGFR/ P09619 inhibitor ) and everolimus ( P42345 inhibitor ) are both approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) as first-line and second-line therapy , respectively . In the clinics , sunitinib treatment is limited by the emergence of acquired resistance , leading to a switch to second-line treatment at progression , often based on everolimus . No data have been yet generated on programmed alternating sequential strategies combining alternative use of sunitinib and everolimus before progression . Such strategy is expected to delay the emergence of acquired resistance and improve tumour control . The aim of our study was to assess the changes in tumours induced by three different sequences administration of sunitinib and everolimus . METHODS : In human Caki-1 RCC xenograft model , sunitinib was alternated with everolimus every week , every 2 weeks , or every 3 weeks . Effects on necrosis , hypoxia , angiogenesis , and EMT status were assessed by immunohisochemistry and immunofluorescence . RESULTS : DB01268 and everolimus programmed sequential regimens before progression yielded longer median time to tumour progression than sunitinib and everolimus monotherapies . In each group of treatment , tumour growth control was associated with inhibition of P42345 pathway and changes from a mesenchymal towards an epithelial phenotype , with a decrease in vimentin and an increase in P12830 expression . The sequential combinations of these two agents in a RCC mouse clinical trial induced antiangiogenic effects , leading to tumour necrosis . CONCLUSIONS : In summary , our study showed that alternate sequence of sunitinib and everolimus mitigated the development of mesenchymal phenotype compared with sunitinib as single agent .
