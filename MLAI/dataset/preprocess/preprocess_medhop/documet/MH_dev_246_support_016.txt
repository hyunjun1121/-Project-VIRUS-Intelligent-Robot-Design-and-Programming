Cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 mediates synergistic induction of Q07343 by roflumilast and NTHi . Phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) plays a key role in regulating inflammation . DB01656 , a phosphodiesterase (PDE)4-selective inhibitor , has recently been approved for treating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) patients with exacerbation . However , there is also clinical evidence suggesting the development of tachyphylaxis or tolerance on repeated dosing of roflumilast and the possible contribution of Q07343 up-regulation , which could be counterproductive for suppressing inflammation . Thus , understanding how Q07343 is up-regulated in the context of the complex pathogenesis and medications of P48444 may help improve the efficacy and possibly ameliorate the tolerance of roflumilast . Here we show that roflumilast synergizes with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) , a major bacterial cause of P48444 exacerbation , to up-regulate PDE4B2 expression in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . Up-regulated PDE4B2 contributes to the induction of certain important chemokines in both enzymatic activity-dependent and activity-independent manners . We also found that protein kinase A catalytic subunit β ( PKA-Cβ ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) p65 subunit were required for the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . PKA-Cβ phosphorylates p65 in a DB02527 -dependent manner . Moreover , Ser276 of p65 is critical for mediating the PKA-Cβ-induced p65 phosphorylation and the synergistic induction of PDE4B2 . Collectively , our data unveil a previously unidentified mechanism underlying synergistic up-regulation of PDE4B2 via a cross-talk between PKA-Cβ and p65 and may help develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of DB05876 inhibitor .
