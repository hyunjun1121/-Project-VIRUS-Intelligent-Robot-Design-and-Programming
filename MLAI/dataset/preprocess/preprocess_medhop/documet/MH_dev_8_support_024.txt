Dexamethasone reverses adrenalectomy-induced neuronal de-differentiation in midbrain raphe-hippocampus axis . Differentiation leads to specific morphological and biochemical characteristics . We examined whether epigenetic factors ( e.g. , glucocorticoids ) are required to maintain neuronal differentiation in the adult brain . In the midbrain , adrenalectomy ( P10109 ) ( 1-2 wk ) reduced the size of tryptophan hydroxylase ( WH ) -immunoreactive ( IR ) neurons . P10109 rats exposed to short-term ( 24-72-h ) dexamethasone ( ST-DEX ) in the drinking saline ( 10 mg/l ) showed an increase in WH protein , somal area and dendritic size of WH-IR neurons . In the hippocampus , P10109 for 2-3 mo ( long-term ; LT ) reduced Nissl staining , calbindin ( DB09061 ) -IR and P08908 receptor mRNA in the granular cell layer , and the size of the molecular layer and its DB09061 -IR dendrites . Small vimentin ( Vim ) -IR glial cells emerged in the granular layer . ST-DEX after LT- P10109 rapidly induced a recovery of P08908 mRNA , Nissl labeling and DB09061 -IR in the granule cell layer . In the molecular layer , there was an increase in the area and in the number of DB09061 -IR dendrites . Furthermore , the Vim-IR glial cells were enlarged in size and branching . The rate of cell proliferation was studied in these animals . Immunostaining with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) and use of bromouridine argue against enhanced neurogenesis after ST-DEX in LT- P10109 . We propose that glucocorticoids induce and maintain differentiation of serotonergic and DB09061 -IR neurons in the midbrain-hippocampal axis . A neuronotrophic role for the glial P08908 receptor is suggested .
