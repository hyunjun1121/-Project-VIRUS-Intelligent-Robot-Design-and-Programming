DB04901 ( IDEC ) . IDEC is developing a PRIMATIZED-anti- P33681 antibody ( DB04901 ) for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . It is currently undergoing phase II trials in patients with psoriasis [ 395813 ] . A randomized , blind , placebo-controlled , multiple-dose phase II study was initiated in January 2001 to evaluate the potential clinical activity and safety of DB04901 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis [ 395813 ] . The antibody targets the P33681 antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells that normally interact with T-cells to initiate an immune response . Antibodies directed at P33681 may be useful in preventing unwanted immune responses in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as well as transplant rejection [ 178382 ] , [ 178929 ] . PRIMATIZED antibodies , genetically engineered from cynomolgus macaque monkey and human components , are structurally indistinguishable from human antibodies . They may , therefore , be less likely to cause adverse reactions in humans , making them potentially suited for long-term , chronic treatment [ 244805 ] . IDEC has signed an antibody humanization patent licensing agreement with Protein Design Labs [ 240591 ] . IDEC is also collaborating with Mitsubishi-Tokyo ( formerly Mitsubishi Kasei ) on the development of this antibody [ 178382 ] .
