Synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists restore impaired vasorelaxation via DB00171 -sensitive K+ channels by high glucose . The present study was designed to examine whether in the human artery , synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma agonists restore vasorelaxation as well as hyperpolarization via DB00171 -sensitive K+ channels impaired by the high concentration of D-glucose and whether the restoration may be mediated by the antioxidant capacity of these agents . The isometric force and membrane potential of human omental arteries without endothelium were recorded . The production rate of superoxide was evaluated using a superoxide-generating system with xanthine-xanthine oxidase in the absence of smooth muscle cells . DB01016 abolished vasorelaxation and hyperpolarization in response to levcromakalim . Addition of D-glucose ( 20 mM ) but not L-glucose ( 20 mM ) reduced this vasorelaxation and hyperpolarization . Synthetic P37231 agonists ( troglitazone and rosiglitazone ) and/or an inhibitor of superoxide generation ( 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid , Tiron ) , but not a Q07869 agonist ( fenofibrate ) , restored vasorelaxation and hyperpolarization in response to levcromakalim in arteries treated with D-glucose . DB00197 and rosiglitazone , but not fenofibrate , decreased the production rate of superoxide without affecting uric acid generation . These findings suggest that synthetic P37231 agonists recover the function of DB00171 -sensitive K+ channels reduced by the high concentration of glucose in human vascular smooth muscle cells and that the effect of these agonists may be mediated in part by their antioxidant capacity .
