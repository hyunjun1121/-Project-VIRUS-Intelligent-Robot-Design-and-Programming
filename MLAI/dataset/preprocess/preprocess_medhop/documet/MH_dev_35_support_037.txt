' VASPFix ' for measurement of P50552 phosphorylation in platelets and for monitoring effects of Q9H244 antagonists . P50552 ( P50552 ) is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated consequent to increases and decreases in cyclic nucleotide levels . Monitoring changes in P50552 phosphorylation is an established method for indirect measurement of cyclic nucleotides . Here we describe the use of an innovative cocktail , VASPFix , which allows sensitive and reproducible measurement of phosphorylated P50552 ( P50552 -P ) in a simple , single-step procedure using cytometric bead technology . Frozen VASPFix-treated samples are stable for at least six months prior to analysis . We successfully used VASPFix to measure P50552 -P in platelets in both platelet-rich plasma and blood in response to compounds that increase ( dibutyryl DB02527 , adenosine , iloprost , PGE1 ) and decrease ( ADP , PGE1 ) DB02527 , and to determine the effects of certain receptor antagonists on the results obtained . The change in P50552 -P brought about by adding ADP to PGE1-stimulated platelets is a combination of the effect of ADP at the Q9H244 receptor and of PGE1 at both IP and EP3 receptors . For iloprost-stimulated platelets EP3 receptors are not involved . A procedure in which iloprost , ADP and VASPFix were used to determine effectiveness of clopidogrel and prasugrel in patients was compared with an established commercial procedure that uses PGE1 and ADP ; the latter produced higher platelet reactivity values that were the result of PGE1 interacting with platelet EP3 receptors . We conclude that VASPFix can be used both as a research tool and for clinical investigations and provides better specificity for Q9H244 receptor inhibition . The latter confers a distinct advantage over existing methods used to monitor effects of Q9H244 antagonists on platelet function .
