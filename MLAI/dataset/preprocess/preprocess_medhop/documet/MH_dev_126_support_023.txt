Modulatory effects of heparin and short-length oligosaccharides of heparin on the metastasis and growth of LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells in vivo . Expression of the chemokine receptor P61073 allows breast cancer cells to migrate towards specific metastatic target sites which constitutively express P48061 . In this study , we determined whether this interaction could be disrupted using short-chain length heparin oligosaccharides . Radioligand competition binding assays were performed using a range of heparin oligosaccharides to compete with polymeric heparin or heparan sulphate binding to I(125) P48061 . DB01109 dodecasaccharides were found to be the minimal chain length required to efficiently bind P48061 ( 71 % inhibition ; P < 0.001 ) . These oligosaccharides also significantly inhibited P48061 -induced migration of P61073 -expressing LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells . In addition , heparin dodecasaccharides were found to have less anticoagulant activity than either a smaller quantity of polymeric heparin or a similar amount of the low molecular weight heparin pharmaceutical product , DB06822 . When given subcutaneously in a SCID mouse model of human breast cancer , heparin dodecasaccharides had no effect on the number of lung metastases , but did however inhibit ( P < 0.05 ) tumour growth ( lesion area ) compared to control groups . In contrast , polymeric heparin significantly inhibited both the number ( P < 0.001 ) and area of metastases , suggesting a differing mechanism for the action of polymeric and heparin-derived oligosaccharides in the inhibition of tumour growth and metastases .
