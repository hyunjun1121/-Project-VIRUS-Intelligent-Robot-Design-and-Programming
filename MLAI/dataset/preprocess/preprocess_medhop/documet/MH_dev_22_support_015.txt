A transcription-independent function of Q12778 in inhibition of androgen-independent activation of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells . Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant activation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of androgen depletion-independent prostate cancer ( PCa ) after androgen deprivation therapy . Here , we show that loss of the P60484 tumor suppressor gene is associated with hyperactivation of the AR in human PCa cell lines . This effect is mediated primarily by its downstream effector Q12778 . In addition to the inhibition of androgenic activation of the AR , forced expression of Q12778 in P60484 -negative PCa cells also inhibits androgen-independent activation of the AR in a manner independent of Q12778 transcriptional function . In contrast , silencing of Q12778 in P60484 -positive cells not only increases the basal activity of the AR in the absence of androgens , it also markedly sensitizes the AR activation by low levels of androgens or nonandrogenic factors such as interleukin-6 . Q12778 -mediated inhibition of the AR is partially attenuated by the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A . Accordingly , Q12778 interacts with O15379 as shown by coimmunoprecipitation assays , and cotransfection of cells with Q12778 and O15379 , but not Q13547 and Q92769 , results in a greater inhibition of AR activity than in cells transfected with Q12778 or O15379 individually . Together , our findings define a novel corepressor function of Q12778 in inhibition of androgen-independent activation of the AR .
