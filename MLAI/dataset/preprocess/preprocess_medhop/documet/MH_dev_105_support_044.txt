Second and third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( P00533 -TKIs ) , gefitinib and erlotinib , are effective as first-line treatment of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring activating P00533 mutations ( deletions in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R mutation ) . P00533 T790 M resistance mutation ( P00533 T790 M ) ultimately emerged in most of these patients . The second and third-generation P00533 -TKIs were designed to have more potent inhibition of P00533 and to overcome P00533 T790 M . This review describes the recent developments of these novel P00533 -TKIs . RECENT FINDINGS : The second-generation P00533 -TKIs , afatinib and dacomitinib , irreversibly bind to the tyrosine kinase of P00533 and other ErbB-family members . DB08916 has been approved as first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring activating P00533 mutations . Dacomitinib is under development . Third-generation P00533 -TKIs , AZD9291 , CO-1686 , and HM61713 , inhibit both P00533 activating and resistance mutations , while sparing wild-type P00533 . In early-phase studies , these drugs demonstrated promising response rates against tumors with acquired P00533 T790 M . SUMMARY : Second-generation P00533 -TKI , afatinib , is available as first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring activating P00533 mutations . Third-generation P00533 -TKIs are under development for tumors harboring acquired P00533 T790 M .
