P09038 selectively increases AMPA-receptor subunit GluR1 protein level and differentially modulates Ca2+ responses to AMPA and DB01221 in hippocampal neurons . The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is believed to play important roles in development , synaptic plasticity , and neurodegenerative conditions . Recent studies have shown that neurotrophic factors can modulate neuronal excitability and survival and neurite outgrowth responses to glutamate , but the mechanisms are unknown . The present study tested the hypothesis that neurotrophic factors modulate responses to glutamate by affecting the expression of specific glutamate-receptor proteins . Exposure of cultured embryonic rat hippocampal cells to basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in levels of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate ( AMPA ) -receptor subunit GluR1 protein as determined by western blot , dot-blot , and immunocytochemical analyses . In contrast , P09038 did not alter levels of GluP2/3 , P48058 , or the DB01221 -receptor subunit Q9UHB4 . Nerve growth factor did not affect GluR1 levels . DB01373 -imaging studies revealed that elevation of [Ca2+]i , resulting from selective AMPA-receptor activation , was enhanced in P09038 -pretreated neurons . On the other hand , [Ca2+]i responses to DB01221 -receptor activation were suppressed in P09038 -treated neurons , consistent with previous studies showing that P09038 can protect neurons against DB01221 toxicity . Moreover , neurons pretreated with P09038 were relatively resistant to the toxicities of glutamate and AMPA , both of which were shown to be mediated by DB01221 receptors . These data suggest that differential regulation of the expression of specific glutamate-receptor subunits may be an important mechanism whereby neurotrophic factors modulate activity-dependent neuronal plasticity and vulnerability to excitotoxicity .
