Dynamic assembly of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator signaling receptor complex determines the mitogenic activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator . The urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) receptor ( Q03405 ) functions in concert with co-receptors , including integrins , P21462 -like receptor-1/lipoxin A4 receptor , and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , to initiate cell signaling . Q03405 co-receptors may be dynamically organized into a multiprotein signaling receptor complex . In Chinese hamster ovary- P04264 ( CHO- P04264 ) cells , uPA-binding to Q03405 activates P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase , even though these cells do not express the P00533 ; however , when CHO- P04264 cells are transfected to express the P00533 , P29323 activation becomes P00533 -dependent . In this study , we demonstrate that P29323 activation in response to uPA follows equivalent biphasic kinetics in P00533 -expressing and -deficient CHO- P04264 cells . In both cell types , the response is pertussis toxin-sensitive ; however , uPA promotes cell proliferation exclusively in the P00533 -expressing cells . uPA-induced mitogenic activity requires activation of both STAT5b and P29323 . STAT5b was tyrosine-phosphorylated , in response to uPA , only in P00533 -expressing cells . uPA-induced cell proliferation was blocked by dominant-negative Q02750 , dominant-negative STAT5b , and by expression of an P00533 that is mutated at DB00135 -845 , which is essential for STAT5b activation . In two cell culture models of uPA-stimulated breast cancer growth , MDA-MB 468 cells treated with uPA and MCF-7 cells treated with uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex , proliferation was completely inhibited when P00533 expression or activity was blocked . We conclude that expression and assembly of Q03405 co-receptors in a specific cell type determines the response to uPA . The P00533 selectively cooperates with Q03405 to mediate mitogenesis .
