Can a cocktail designed for phenotyping pharmacokinetics and metabolism enzymes in human be used efficiently in rat ? We recently designed the CIME cocktail consisting of 10 drugs to assess the activity of the major human CYPs ( P05177 , P10632 , P11712 , P33261 , P10635 and CYP3A ) , a phase II enzyme ( P22309 /6/9 ) , two drug transporters ( P-gp and Q9Y6L6 ) and a component of the renal function ( Videau et al. 2010 ) . The present work aimed at studying the usefulness of the CIME cocktail in the rat.The CIME cocktail was given per os to three male and three female rats , or incubated with rat liver microsomes . Parent substrates and metabolites were quantified by LC-MS/MS in plasma , urine and hepatic microsomal media , and phenotyping index were subsequently calculated.The CIME cocktail could therefore be used in the rat to phenotype rapidly and simultaneously CYP3A1/2 with omeprazole/omeprazole-sulfone , midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam or 4-hydroxymidazolam and/or dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan , CYP2C6/11 with tolbutamide/4-hydroxytolbutamide , CYP2D1/2 with omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole or dextromethorphan/dextrorphan , and P19224 /7 with acetaminophen/acetaminophen-glucuronide . Our results confirmed also several known gender differences and brought new information on the urinary excretion of rosuvastatin . However , the major rat CYPs , CYP2C11 and CYP2C12 , are not specifically assessed . An optimized version of the CIME cocktail should therefore be designed and would be of major importance to more largely phenotype Q09013 enzymes in rats to study Q09013 variability factors such as disease , age , or to exposure to inductors or inhibitors .
