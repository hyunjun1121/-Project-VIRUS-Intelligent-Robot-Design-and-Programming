Effects of zileuton and montelukast in mouse experimental spinal cord injury . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : P09917 ( P09917 ) is the key enzyme in leukotriene ( LT ) biosynthesis from arachidonic acid ( AA ) . Here , we examined the role of the P09917 -product , cysteinyl-LT ( DB00151 -LT ) , with a P09917 inhibitor ( zileuton ) and a DB00151 -LT , receptor antagonist ( montelukast ) , in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : SCI was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a two-level Q8NHM4 to T7 laminectomy for 1 min . Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators ( ELISA ) and apoptosis by annexin V , TUNEL , P48023 staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression ( immunohistochemistry and western blots ) . Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale , for 10 days after cord injury . KEY RESULTS : SCI in mice resulted in tissue damage , oedema , neutrophil infiltration , apoptosis , tumour necrosis-alpha ( P01375 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression , prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) and leukotriene B(4) ( Q06643 (4) ) production , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) phosphorylation in injured tissue . Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury , neutrophil infiltration , P01375 , P35354 and pERK1/2 expression , PGE(2) and Q06643 (4) production , and apoptosis . In separate experiments , zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI . Our data underline the important role of P09917 and DB00151 -LT in neurotrauma .
