Genomic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer in smokers and never-smokers . We report the results of whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from 17 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . We identified 3,726 point mutations and more than 90 indels in the coding sequence , with an average mutation frequency more than 10-fold higher in smokers than in never-smokers . Novel alterations in genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA repair pathways were identified , along with Q9UI36 , P13569 , P78509 , Q2M3G0 , and P14210 . Deep digital sequencing revealed diverse clonality patterns in both never-smokers and smokers . All validated EFGR and P01116 mutations were present in the founder clones , suggesting possible roles in cancer initiation . Analysis revealed 14 fusions , including P08922 and Q9UM73 , as well as novel metabolic enzymes . Cell-cycle and JAK- P35610 pathways are significantly altered in lung cancer , along with perturbations in 54 genes that are potentially targetable with currently available drugs .
