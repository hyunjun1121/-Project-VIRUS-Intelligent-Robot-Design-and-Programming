The effects of mitiglinide ( KAD-1229 ) , a new anti-diabetic drug , on DB00171 -sensitive K+ channels and insulin secretion : comparison with the sulfonylureas and nateglinide . DB01252 ( KAD-1229 ) , a new anti-diabetic drug , is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the DB00171 -sensitive K+ ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels in pancreatic beta-cells . However , its selectivity for the various K( DB00171 ) channels is not known . In this study , we examined the effects of mitiglinide on various cloned K( DB00171 ) channels ( Kir6.2/ Q09428 , Kir6.2/SUR2A , and Kir6.2/SUR2B ) reconstituted in COS-1 cells , and compared them to another meglitinide-related compound , nateglinide . Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that mitiglinide inhibits the Kir6.2/ Q09428 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner ( IC50 value , 100 nM ) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses ( more than 10 microM ) . DB00731 inhibits Kir6.2/ Q09428 and Kir6.2/SUR2B channels at 100 nM , and inhibits Kir6.2/SUR2A channels at high concentrations ( 1 microM ) . Binding experiments on mitiglinide , nateglinide , and repaglinide to Q09428 expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of [3H]glibenclamide to Q09428 ( IC50 values : mitiglinide , 280 nM ; nateglinide , 8 microM ; repaglinide , 1.6 microM ) , suggesting that they all share a glibenclamide binding site . The insulin responses to glucose , mitiglinide , tolbutamide , and glibenclamide in MIN6 cells after chronic mitiglinide , nateglinide , or repaglinide treatment were comparable to those after chronic tolbutamide and glibenclamide treatment . These results indicate that , similar to the sulfonylureas , mitiglinide is highly specific to the Kir6.2/ Q09428 complex , i.e. , the pancreatic beta-cell K( DB00171 ) channel , and suggest that mitiglinide may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug .
