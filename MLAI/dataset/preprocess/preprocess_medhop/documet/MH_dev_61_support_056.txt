P10275 expression induces P09038 , FGF-binding protein production , and P09038 release in prostate carcinoma cells : role of P09038 in growth , survival , and androgen receptor down-modulation . BACKGROUND : Alterations in fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) production and/or FGF receptors expression have been described to play key roles in prostate tumor progression , particularly in androgen-independent tumors . However , the role of androgen receptor ( AR ) in altering FGF-mediated growth and survival of prostatic neoplastic cells has not been completely defined . In this study , we investigated the alterations in P09038 production and utilization by the PC3 cell line , after transfection with a full-length AR . METHODS : P05230 ,2,7 , FGF-binding protein ( Q14512 ) production and FGF receptor ( FGFR ) 1-4 expression were investigated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and Western blot analysis . RESULTS : De novo AR expression by PC3 cells restores P21802 IIIb isoform expression and sensitivity to P21781 and P09038 . Androgen stimulation induces AR+ PC3 clones to secrete Q14512 , likely responsible for activation and mobilization from the extracellular matrix of the high amounts of P09038 produced by the same cells . In addition to the effects on cell proliferation , P09038 maintains the survival of AR+ PC3 clones through a positive modulation of the Bcl-2 protein and down-modulates AR protein expression , allowing the escape of selected clones from androgen regulation . CONCLUSION : In the presence of an active AR , the combined production of P09038 and Q14512 may play an important role in the progression of prostate cancer through the selection of AR- clones expressing high levels of Bcl-2 .
