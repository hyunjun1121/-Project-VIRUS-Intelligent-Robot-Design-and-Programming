Serotonin and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of extrapyramidal side effects in perphenazine-treated schizophrenic patients . RATIONALE : DB00850 , a classical antipsychotic drug , has the potential to induce extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) . Dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways are involved in the therapeutic and adverse effects of the drug . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the impact of polymorphisms in the dopamine D(2) and D(3) and serotonin 2A and 2C receptor genes ( P14416 , P35462 , P28223 , and P28335 ) on short-term effects of perphenazine monotherapy in schizophrenic patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Forty-seven Estonian inpatients were evaluated before and after 4-6 weeks of treatment by Simpson-Angus rating scale , Barnes scale , and Positive and Negative Symptom Scale . Genotyping was performed for common P14416 , P35462 , P28223 , and P28335 gene polymorphisms , previously reported to influence receptor expression and/or function . RESULTS : Most of the patients ( n = 37 ) responded to the treatment and no significant association was observed between the polymorphisms and antipsychotic response . The 102C allele of P28223 and the -697C and 23Ser alleles of P28335 were more frequent among patients with EPS ( n = 25 ) compared to patients without EPS ( n = 22 ) ( p = 0.02 , 0.01 , and 0.02 , respectively ) . The difference between patients with and without EPS in variant allele frequencies remained significant after multiple model analyses including age , gender , and duration of antipsychotic treatment as covariants . There was no significant association between EPS occurrence and polymorphisms in the P14416 and P35462 genes . CONCLUSIONS : An association was observed between polymorphisms in P28223 and P28335 genes and occurrence of acute EPS in schizophrenic patients treated with perphenazine monotherapy . Larger study populations are needed to confirm our findings .
