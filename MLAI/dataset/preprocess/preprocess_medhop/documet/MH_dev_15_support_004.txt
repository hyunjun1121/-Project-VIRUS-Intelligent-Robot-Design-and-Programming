An absolute role of the PKC-dependent NF-kappaB activation for induction of P14780 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) play an important role in inflammation , tumor cell invasion , and metastasis . We found that phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) -stimulated invasion of the hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) SNU-387 and SNU-398 cells and that PMA induced the secretion of P14780 in the cells , but did not induce the secretion of P08253 . The PMA-induced P14780 secretion was abolished by treatment of a pan-protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor , GF109203X , and an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation , sulfasalazine , and partly inhibited by treatment of inhibitors of P29323 pathway , PD98059 and U0126 . In addition , the PMA-stimulated activation of the P14780 promoter was completely inhibited by a mutation of the NF-kappaB site within the P14780 promoter , but not completely by mutations of two AP-1 sites . Moreover , the P14780 induction by P14210 and P01375 was also completely inhibited by GF109203X and sulfasalazine , but not by PD98059 and U0126 . These data demonstrate that the PKC-dependent NF-kappaB activation is absolute for P14780 induction and that the PKC-dependent P29323 activation devotes to increase the expression level of P14780 , in HCC cells .
