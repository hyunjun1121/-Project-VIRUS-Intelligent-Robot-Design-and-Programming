MicroRNA-302 replacement therapy sensitizes breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation . PURPOSE : Solid tumors can be resistant or develop resistance to radiotherapy . The purpose of this study is to explore whether microRNA-302 is involved in radioresistance and can be exploited as a sensitizer to enhance sensitivity of breast cancer cells to radiation therapy . METHODS : MiR-302 expression levels in radioresistant cell lines were analyzed in comparison with their parent cell lines . Furthermore , we investigated whether enforced expression of miR-302 sensitized radioresistant breast cancer cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS : MiR-302 was downregulated in irradiated breast cancer cells . Additionally , the expression levels of miR-302a were inversely correlated with those of P31749 and P43351 , two critical regulators of radioresistance . More promisingly , miR-302a sensitized radioresistant breast cancer cells to radiation therapy in vitro and in vivo and reduced the expression of P31749 and P43351 . CONCLUSION : Our findings demonstrated that decreased expression of miR-302 confers radioresistance and restoration of miR-302 baseline expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to radiotherapy . These data suggest that miR-302 is a potential sensitizer to radiotherapy .
