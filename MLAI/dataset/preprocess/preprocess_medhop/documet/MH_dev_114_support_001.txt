Intracolonic administration of zileuton , a selective P09917 inhibitor , accelerates healing in a rat model of chronic colitis . BACKGROUND : 5-Lipoxygenase products play a part in inflammatory response . AIMS : The effect of intracolonic administration of zileuton ( a P09917 inhibitor ) on colonic damage and eicosanoid local release was assessed in a rat model of colitis . METHODS : Ninety rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid induced colitis were randomised to receive placebo , DB00244 ( 50 mg/kg ) , or zileuton ( 50 mg/kg ) intracolonically for four weeks . Local eicosanoid release was monitored by intracolonic dialysis throughout the study . The colon was removed for macroscopic and histological assessment at weeks 1 , 2 , and 4 after colitis induction in 10 rats of each group . RESULTS : Zileuton significantly reduced macroscopic damage score after four weeks of treatment in comparison with the other two groups ( p = 0.034 ) . In addition , zileuton administration significantly increased the intracolonic release of both thromboxane B2 at week 1 ( p = 0.05 ) and prostaglandin E2 at weeks 2 and 4 ( p < 0.05 ) . Zileuton and DB00244 decreased leukotriene B4 release by 90 % at day 3 . CONCLUSIONS : Intracolonic zileuton , compared with DB00244 and placebo , seems to improve the course of the disease in a model of chronic colitis . This effect may be related to an increased and maintained production of prostaglandin E2 together with inhibition of leukotriene B4 synthesis .
