Differential effects of placental restriction on P01344 , Q01718 and steroidogenic enzyme mRNA levels in the foetal sheep adrenal . We have investigated the effects of restriction of placental growth on foetal adrenal growth and adrenal expression of mRNAs for P01308 -like Growth Factor II ( P01344 ) , the IGF binding protein P18065 , Steroidogenic Factor 1 ( Q13285 ) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) receptor ( Q01718 ) and the steroidogenic cytochrome P-450 enzymes : cholesterol side chain cleavage ( P05108 ) , 17alpha-hydroxylase ( P05093 ) and 21-hydroxylase ( CYP21A1 ) ; and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5Delta4 isomerase ( 3betaHSD ) . Endometrial caruncles were removed from non-pregnant ewes before mating ( placental restriction group ; PR ) . The total adrenal : foetal weight ratio was higher in PR ( n=6 foetuses ) than in control foetuses ( n=6 foetuses ) . There was no difference in plasma DB01285 concentrations between the PR and control foetuses between 130 and 140 days gestation . Adrenal P01344 mRNA levels were lower ( P < 0.05 ) in the PR group , however , adrenal P18065 mRNA levels were not different between the PR and control groups . Adrenal Q01718 mRNA levels were also lower whilst P05108 mRNA levels were increased ( P < 0.005 ) in the PR group . We conclude that foetal adrenal growth and steroidogenesis are stimulated as a consequence of foetal growth restriction and that factors other than DB01285 are important in foetal adrenal activation during chronic , sustained hypoxaemia .
