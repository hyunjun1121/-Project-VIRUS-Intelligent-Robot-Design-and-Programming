Phase II study of weekly intravenous oxaliplatin combined with oral daily capecitabine and radiotherapy with biologic correlates in neoadjuvant treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma . PURPOSE : To evaluate the efficacy of a combination of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and radiotherapy ( RT ) in the neoadjuvant treatment of Stage II and III rectal cancers . METHODS : DB01101 was given at 725 mg/m(2) orally twice daily Monday through Friday concurrently with RT . DB00526 was given intravenously at 50 mg/m(2) once weekly five times starting the first day of RT . The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ( 1.8 Gy/fraction ) , five fractions weekly . Endorectal tumor biopsies were obtained before treatment and on the third day of treatment to explore the effects of treatment on thymidine phosphorylase , thymidylate synthase , excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 ( P07992 ) , and apoptosis . RESULTS : A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this study ; 6 patients ( 24 % ) had a complete pathologic response . T-downstaging occurred in 52 % of patients , and N-downstaging occurred in 53 % . Grade 3 diarrhea was the most common Grade 3-4 toxicity , occurring in 20 % of patients . Only 2 patients experienced disease recurrence , with a median of 20 months of follow-up . P04818 , thymidine phosphorylase , P07992 , and apoptosis did not vary significantly between the pretreatment and Day 3 tumor biopsies , nor did they predict for T-downstaging or a complete pathologic response . CONCLUSION : DB01101 at 725 mg/m(2) orally twice daily , oxaliplatin 50 mg/m(2)/wk , and RT at 50.4 Gy is an effective neoadjuvant combination for Stage II and III rectal cancer and results in a greater rate of complete pathologic responses than historically shown in fluoropyrimidine plus RT controls .
