The influence of variation in the Q9H244 receptor gene on in vitro platelet inhibition with the direct Q9H244 antagonist cangrelor . Novel Q9H244 inhibitors are in development to overcome the occurrence of atherothrombotic events associated with poor responsiveness to the widely used Q9H244 inhibitor clopidogrel . DB06441 is an intravenously administered Q9H244 inhibitor that does not need metabolic conversion to an active metabolite for its antiplatelet action , and as a consequence exhibits a more potent and consistent antiplatelet profile as compared to clopidogrel . It was the objective of this study to determine the contribution of variation in the Q9H244 receptor gene to platelet aggregation after in vitro partial Q9H244 receptor blockade with the direct antagonist cangrelor . Optical aggregometry was performed at baseline and after in vitro addition of 0.05 and 0.25 microM cangrelor to the platelet-rich plasma of 254 healthy subjects . Five haplotype-tagging (ht)-SNPs covering the entire Q9H244 receptor gene were genotyped ( rs6798347C > t , rs6787801T > c , rs9859552C > a , rs6801273A > g and rs2046934T > c [ T744C ] ) and haplotypes were inferred . The minor c allele of SNP rs6787801 was associated with a 5 % lower 20 microM ADP-induced peak platelet aggregation ( 0.05 microM cangrelor , p < 0.05 ) . Aa homozygotes for SNP rs9859552 showed 20 % and 17 % less inhibition of platelet aggregation with cangrelor when compared to CC homozygotes ( 0.05 and 0.25 microM cangrelor respectively ; p < 0.05 ) . Results of the haplotype analyses were consistent with those of the single SNPs . Polymorphisms of the Q9H244 receptor gene contribute significantly to the interindividual variability in platelet inhibition after partial in vitro blockade with the Q9H244 antagonist cangrelor .
