Age-associated decrease in TLR function in primary human dendritic cells predicts influenza vaccine response . We evaluated TLR function in primary human dendritic cells ( DCs ) from 104 young ( age 21-30 y ) and older ( > or =65 y ) individuals . We used multicolor flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining of myeloid DCs ( mDCs ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) and found substantial decreases in older compared with young individuals in P01375 , P05231 , and/or IL-12 ( p40 ) production in mDCs and in P01375 and IFN-alpha production in pDCs in response to Q15399 /2 , O60603 /6 , O15455 , O60602 , and Q9NR97 engagement in mDCs and Q9NYK1 and Q9NR96 in pDCs . These differences were highly significant after adjustment for heterogeneity between young and older groups ( e.g. , gender , race , body mass index , number of comorbid medical conditions ) using mixed-effect statistical modeling . Studies of surface and intracellular expression of TLR proteins and of TLR gene expression in purified mDCs and pDCs revealed potential contributions for both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in these age-associated effects . Moreover , intracellular cytokine production in the absence of TLR ligand stimulation was elevated in cells from older compared with young individuals , suggesting a dysregulation of cytokine production that may limit further activation by TLR engagement . Our results provide evidence for immunosenescence in DCs ; notably , defects in cytokine production were strongly associated with poor Ab response to influenza immunization , a functional consequence of impaired TLR function in the aging innate immune response .
