Canine placental prostaglandin E2 synthase : expression , localization , and biological functions in providing substrates for prepartum PGF2alpha synthesis . The prepartum output of PGF2alpha in the bitch is associated with increased placental DB00917 -synthase ( O14684 ) mRNA levels . Contrasting with this is a decreased expression of PGF2alpha-synthase ( P42330 / P42330 ) in uteroplacental compartments during prepartum luteolysis , suggesting an involvement of alternative synthetic pathways in PGF2alpha synthesis , for example , conversion of DB00917 to PGF2alpha . However , because the expression and possible functions of the respective O14684 proteins remained unknown , no further conclusion could be drawn . Therefore , a canine-specific O14684 antibody was generated and used to investigate the expression , cellular localization , and biochemical activities of canine uteroplacental O14684 throughout pregnancy and at prepartum luteolysis . Additionally , the biochemical activities of these tissues involved in the conversion of DB00917 to PGF2alpha were investigated . The endometrial O14684 was localized in the uterine surface epithelium at preimplantation and in superficial and deep uterine glands , endothelial cells , and myometrium throughout pregnancy and at parturition . Placental signals were mostly in the trophoblast . The biochemical properties of recombinant O14684 protein were confirmed . Additionally , expression of two DB00917 -receptors , PTGER2/EP2 and P35408 /EP4 , revealed their decreasing expression during luteolysis . In contrast , the uteroplacental expression of prostaglandin transporter ( Q92959 ) was strongly elevated prior to parturition . These localization patterns resembled that of O14684 . The increased expression of O14684 and Q92959 at parturition , together with the accompanying decreased levels of DB00917 -receptors and the capability of canine uterine and placental homogenates to take part in the conversion of DB00917 to PGF2alpha , as found in this study , suggest that DB00917 could be used locally as a substrate for prepartum PGF2alpha synthesis in the dog .
