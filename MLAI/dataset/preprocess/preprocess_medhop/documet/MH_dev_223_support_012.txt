DB08865 for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer . DB08865 is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of Q9UM73 ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ; Q9UM73 ) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( P08581 , proto-oncogene c- DB00134 ) . A range of tumors , including subsets of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor an Q9UM73 rearrangement that leads to oncogenic activation of Q9UM73 . DB08865 has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity against such malignancies through inhibition of Q9UM73 , and patients harboring Q9UM73 - rearranged NSCLC have demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival in phase I and II studies . In August 2011 , crizotinib was approved for the treatment of advanced Q9UM73 -positive NSCLC .
