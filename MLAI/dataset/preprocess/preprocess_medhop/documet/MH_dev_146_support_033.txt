Combining resonance energy transfer methods reveals a complex between the alpha2A-adrenergic receptor , Galphai1beta1gamma2 , and P25098 . Traditionally , G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) interactions with their G proteins and regulatory proteins , GPCR kinases ( GRKs ) and arrestins , are described as sequential events involving rapid assemblies/disassemblies . To directly monitor the dynamics of these interactions in living cells , we combined two spectrally resolved bioluminescence and one fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( P07949 ) methods . The P07949 combination analysis revealed that stimulation of the α(2A)-adrenergic receptor ( α(2A)AR ) leads to the recruitment of P25098 at a receptor still associated with the Gα(i1)β(1)γ(2) complex . The interaction kinetics of GRKs with Gγ(2) ( 2.8 ± 0.4 s ) and α(2A)AR ( 5.2 ± 0.5 s ) were similar to that of the receptor-promoted change in P07949 between Gα(i1) and Gγ(2) ( 5.2 ± 1.2 s ) , and persisted until the translocation of βarrestin2 to the receptor , indicating that P25098 remains associated to the receptor/G-protein complex for longer periods than anticipated . Moreover , P25098 or a kinase-deficient P25098 mutant , but not P34947 , potentiated the receptor-promoted changes in P07949 between Gα(i1) and Gγ(2) and abrogated the α(2A)AR-stimulated calcium response , suggesting that the recruitment of P25098 to the complex contributes to the structural rearrangement and functional regulation of the signaling unit , independently of the kinase activity . P07949 combination analysis revealed unanticipated dynamics in GPCR signaling and will be applicable to many biological systems .
