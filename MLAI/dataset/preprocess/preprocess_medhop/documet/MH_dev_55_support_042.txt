Interleukin 10 blocks matrix metalloproteinase-2 and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase synthesis in primary human prostate tumor lines . P01308 -like growth factor ( IGF ) I has been shown previously to up-regulate matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) production , whereas the interleukin ( IL ) 10/ P22301 receptor axis has been found to down-regulate P08253 synthesis in tumor cells . In this paper , we showed that P22301 activation of the P22301 receptor blocked P08253 and membrane type 1 ( MT1 ) -MMP transcription and protein synthesis in nonimmortalized primary human prostate cell strains ( i.e. , P84074 -10a and P84074 -10c ) derived from high-grade cancer . Northern blots , Western blots , and ELISAs showed that P22301 suppressed P05019 induction of P08253 and P50281 mRNA synthesis in these cell strains ( P < 0.001 ) . Inhibition studies with P22301 and P08069 antibodies plus transfections experiments with P22301 sense , and P08069 antisense constructs confirmed these results . Finally , transient transfection experiments and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays with different regions of the 5' promoter region of the P08253 gene ( -1659 to -555 bp ) additionally showed that P05019 stimulated p53-dependent plasmid catecholamine acetyltransferase activity and that P22301 blocked P05019 -induced plasmid catecholamine acetyltransferase activity . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that P22301 induced protein(s) binding to a putative " silencer element " ( -1309 to -555 fragment ) downstream of the p53 binding site ( -1649 to -1640 ) . The data show that P22301 blocks P05019 activation of P08253 and P50281 mRNA expression and protein synthesis in primary prostate cell strains .
