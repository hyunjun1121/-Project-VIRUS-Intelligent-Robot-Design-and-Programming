Lack of clinical manifestations in asymptomatic dengue infection is attributed to broad down-regulation and selective up-regulation of host defence response genes . OBJECTIVES : Dengue represents one of the most serious life-threatening vector-borne infectious diseases that afflicts approximately 50 million people across the globe annually . Whilst symptomatic infections are frequently reported , asymptomatic dengue remains largely unnoticed . Therefore , we sought to investigate the immune correlates conferring protection to individuals that remain clinically asymptomatic . METHODS : We determined the levels of neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs ) and gene expression profiles of host immune factors in individuals with asymptomatic infections , and whose cognate household members showed symptoms consistent to clinical dengue infection . RESULTS : We observed broad down-regulation of host defense response ( innate , adaptive and matrix metalloprotease ) genes in asymptomatic individuals as against symptomatic patients , with selective up-regulation of distinct genes that have been associated with protection . Selected down-regulated genes include : P01375 α ( P01375 ) , P10145 , P09871 , factor B ( P00751 ) , P60568 , P08700 , P05112 , P05113 , P10145 , P15248 , P22301 and P35225 , P33681 , P10747 , and Q14116 , P22894 , P09238 , P39900 , P51511 , P51512 , and Q9Y5R2 . Selected up-regulated genes include : RANTES ( P13501 ) , MIP-1α ( P16619 / P16619 ) , MIP-1β ( Q8NHW4 ) , TGFβ ( P01137 ) , and P01033 . CONCLUSION : Our findings highlight the potential association of certain host genes conferring protection against clinical dengue . These data are valuable to better explore the mysteries behind the hitherto poorly understood immunopathogenesis of subclinical dengue infection .
