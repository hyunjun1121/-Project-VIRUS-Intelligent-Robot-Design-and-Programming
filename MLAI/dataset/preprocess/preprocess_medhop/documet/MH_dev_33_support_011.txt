GVHD prophylaxis with sirolimus-tacrolimus may overcome the deleterious effect on survival of HLA mismatch after reduced-intensity conditioning allo- P09683 . Large studies , mostly based on series of patients receiving Q13216 /tacrolimus ( P51854 ) plus MTX as immunoprophylaxis , have demonstrated a deleterious effect on survival of the presence of a single mismatch out of eight loci after allogeneic hematopoietic P09683 ( alloHSCT ) . We retrospectively analyzed a series of 159 adult patients who received sirolimus( Q86TD4 )/ P51854 prophylaxis after alloHSCT . We compared overall outcomes according to HLA compatibility in A , B , C and Q8IUH3 loci at the allele level : 7/8 ( n=20 ) vs 8/8 ( n=139 ) . Donor type was unrelated in 95 % vs 70 % among 7/8 vs 8/8 pairs , respectively ( P=0.01 ) . No significant differences were observed in 3-year OS ( 68 vs 62 % ) , 3-year O43281 ( 53 vs 49 % ) and 1-year non-relapse mortality ( 9 vs 13 % ) . Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) was significantly higher in 7/8 alloHSCT ( 68 % vs 42 % , P < 0.001 ) but no significant differences were found for III-IV aGVHD ( 4.5 % vs 11 % ) , overall ( 35 % vs 53 % ) and extensive ( 20 % vs 35 % ) chronic GHVD in 7/8 vs 8/8 subgroups , respectively . In summary , the present study indicates favorable outcomes after alloHSCT using the combination of Q86TD4 / P51854 combination as GVHD prophylaxis with OS in the range of 55-70 % , and non-significant differences in overall outcomes , irrespective of the presence of any mismatches at obligatory loci .
