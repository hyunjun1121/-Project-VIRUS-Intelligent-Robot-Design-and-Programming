DB00360 , a cofactor for NOS , improves endothelial dysfunction during chronic alcohol consumption . We sought to investigate mechanisms that may account for impaired nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) -dependent dilatation of cerebral arterioles during alcohol consumption . Our goals were to examine 1 ) the effect of exogenous application of a cofactor for NOS , i.e. , tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) on the reactivity of pial arterioles during alcohol consumption ; and 2 ) endothelial NOS ( P29474 ) protein in nonalcohol-fed and alcohol-fed rats . Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets with or without alcohol for 2-3 mo . We measured in vivo diameter of pial arterioles in response to NOS-dependent agonists ( ACh and ADP ) and a NOS-independent agonist ( nitroglycerin ) before and during application of BH4 . Blood vessels were then harvested for Western blot analysis of P29474 protein . In nonalcohol-fed rats , ACh and ADP produced vasodilatation , which was impaired in alcohol-fed rats . Vasodilatation to nitroglycerin was similar in both groups of rats . Application of BH4 did not alter vasodilatation in nonalcohol-fed rats but improved impaired vasodilatation in alcohol-fed rats . Also , P29474 protein in cerebral cortex microvessels , the basilar artery , and aorta was not different between nonalcohol-fed and alcohol-fed rats . Thus impaired NOS-dependent vasodilatation during alcohol consumption does not appear to be related to an alteration in P29474 protein but may be related to a deficiency and/or alteration in the utilization of BH4 .
