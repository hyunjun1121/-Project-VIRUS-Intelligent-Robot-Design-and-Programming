AM251 induces apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in A375 human melanoma cells . Human cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant type of cancer . AM251 is a cannabinoid type 1 ( P21554 ) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist with off-target antitumor activity against pancreatic and colon cancer cells . The current study aimed to characterize the in-vitro antimelanoma activity of AM251 . The P15056 V600E mutant melanoma cell line , A375 , was used as an in-vitro model system . Characterization tools included a cell viability assay , nuclear morphology assessment , gene expression , western blot , flow cytometry with P08758 -FITC/7-AAD double staining , cell cycle analyses , and measurements of changes in intracellular DB02527 and calcium concentrations . AM251 exerted a marked cytotoxic effect against A375 human melanoma cells with potency comparable with that observed for cisplatin without significant changes in the human dermal fibroblasts viability . AM251 , at a concentration that approximates the IC50 , downregulated genes encoding antiapoptotic proteins ( P10415 and survivin ) and increased transcription levels of proapoptotic Q07812 , induced alteration of P08758 reactivity , DNA fragmentation , chromatin condensation in the cell nuclei , and G2/M phase arrest.AM251 also induced a 40 % increase in the basal DB02527 levels , but it did not affect intracellular calcium concentrations . The involvement of Q9Y2T6 , O75762 , and P35354 in the AM251 mechanism of action was excluded . The combination of AM251 with celecoxib produced a synergistic antitumor activity , although the mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated . This study provides the first evidence of a proapoptotic effect and G2/M cell cycle arrest of AM251 on A375 cells . This compound may be a potential prototype for the development of promising diarylpyrazole derivatives to be evaluated in human cutaneous melanoma .
