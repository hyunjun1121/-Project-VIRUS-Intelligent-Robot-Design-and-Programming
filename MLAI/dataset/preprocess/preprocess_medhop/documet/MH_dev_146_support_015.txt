DB08875 for the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer . INTRODUCTION : Patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) have poor prognoses and limited treatment options . Improved knowledge about molecular aberrations associated with P04629 and the availability of novel targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have led to new potential treatment modalities . DB08875 is an oral multitargeted TKI with activity against multiple receptors including P07949 , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 ( P35968 ) , and MET that has been evaluated in P04629 in the preclinical and clinical arenas . METHODS : This article reviews unmet clinical needs in advanced P04629 . The authors consider novel agents that have been studied in P04629 , with a focus on the investigational agent cabozantinib . Up-to-date clinical data of cabozantinib in P04629 are discussed . RESULTS : Recent clinical evaluation suggests that cabozantinib is the first agent to prolong progression-free survival in patients with progressive P04629 . These findings indicate that cabozantinib may be an effective therapy in advanced P04629 . No improvement in overall survival has been demonstrated but data are not mature . CONCLUSION : DB08875 may be an effective treatment option for patients with advanced P04629 and is worthy of further evaluation .
