Regulation of channels by the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase - implications for transport , excitability and cell proliferation . The serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase O00141 stimulates the Na+ channels ENaC and Q14524 , the K+ channels P48048 , Kv1.3 , and P15382 / P51787 , the cation conductance induced by 4F2/ Q01650 and the chloride conductance induced by P13569 . The isoforms Q9HBY8 and Q96BR1 have similarly been shown to regulate ENaC , Q14524 , Kv1.3 and P15382 / P51787 . The kinases regulate channel abundance in the plasma membrane in part by inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase Q96PU5 and in part by interaction with trafficking molecules such as the Na+/H+ exchanger regulating factor Q15599 . An in vivo role of O00141 mediated ENaC channel regulation in renal salt excretion and blood pressure control is documented by the impaired ability of O00141 knockout mice to adequately reduce renal Na+ output and maintain blood pressure during dietary salt restriction and by enhanced blood pressure in individuals carrying certain polymorphisms in the O00141 gene . The in vivo physiological significance of O00141 dependent regulation of the other channels remains to be shown even though circumstantial evidence points to involvement in the regulation of epithelial transport , cell volume , cell proliferation , cardiac action potential and neuroexcitability . There is little doubt that further channels will be identified which are modulated by the SGKs and that further in vivo physiological functions will be defined where channel regulation by the SGKs plays a critical role .
