Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent early diabetic retinopathy via P01375 suppression . Leukocyte adhesion to the diabetic retinal vasculature results in blood-retinal barrier breakdown , capillary nonperfusion , and endothelial cell injury and death . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and the leukocyte integrin P05107 are required for these processes . Diabetes was induced in Long Evans rats , resulting in a two- to threefold increase in retinal leukocyte adhesion . Following one week of diabetes , neutrophil CD11a , CD11b , and P05107 expression was increased significantly , as were retinal P05362 levels . Animals were treated with aspirin , a cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor ( meloxicam ) , or a soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) receptor/Fc construct ( TNFR-Fc , etanercept ) . High-dose aspirin , etanercept , and high-dose meloxicam each reduced leukocyte adhesion and suppressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown . High-dose aspirin also reduced the expression of CD11a , CD11b , and P05107 , whereas meloxicam and etanercept did not . High-dose aspirin , etanercept , and high-dose meloxicam each reduced retinal P05362 expression . DB00945 and meloxicam both lowered retinal P01375 levels . Notably , aspirin , meloxicam , and etanercept did not change retinal vascular endothelial growth factor levels . High-dose aspirin , etanercept and high-dose meloxicam , each suppressed the retinal expression of P29474 and the DNA-binding capacity of retinal nuclear factor-kappaB . High-dose aspirin also suppressed Erk kinase activity , which is involved in P05107 up-regulation . Taken together , these data identify P35354 and P01375 as operative in the early signature pathologies of diabetic retinopathy , a newly recognized inflammatory disease .
