25-Hydroxycholesterol is not a ligand for the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 ( Q13285 ) . The orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 ( Q13285 ) is involved in the transcriptional regulation of all the steroid hydroxylase genes , and also regulates the transcription of the genes for MÃ¼llerian Inhibitory substance ( P03971 ) , alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormone , LHbeta , oxytocin , P30968 , Q01718 , prolactin receptor , DAX-1 , and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein . Other members of the nuclear receptor gene family , including steroid hormone , thyroid hormone , retinoic acid , Q07869 , and vitamin D receptors must bind ligand to activate transcription , but Q13285 has been considered to be an orphan nuclear receptor because , when identified , it had no known ligand . A recent publication suggested that transcriptional regulation by Q13285 , expressed in a non-steroidogenic CV-1 cells , could be activated by oxysterols suggesting that these compounds could serve as natural ligands for Q13285 . We now demonstrate that 25-hydroxycholesterol , either added exogenously or synthesized endogenously in steroidogenic mouse Leydig MA-10 cells , did not act as a ligand for Q13285 , as it did not increase transcription from six different Q13285 -dependent DNA sequences . Furthermore , the abundance of these oxysterols in MA-10 cells was much less than concentrations needed for activation of Q13285 in CV-1 cells , indicating that Q13285 is not constitutively bound by ligand in MA-10 cells . Thus , in steroidogenic cells , transcriptional regulation of the steroid hydroxylase genes by Q13285 does not depend upon the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol , and is not modified by its presence .
