[ Biologic therapies in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases ] . Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases which can be difficult to control with conventional therapies . Thanks to a better knowledge of their physiopathology , new therapies aimed at specific targets of the inflammatory cascade were developed . Three monoclonal anti- P01375 antibodies were produced . DB00065 and adalimumab , currently widely used , can induce sustained remission in Crohn 's disease . DB00065 is also efficacious in UC . DB08904 provides good short term results ; its long term efficacy , however , remains to be assessed by further clinical trials . Therapies targeting leucocyte trafficking ( anti-integrine ) have also been provided and are associated with good clinical responses in Crohn 's disease . DB00108 ( anti-alpha4 ) is responsible for significant side effects and is no longer in use in gasrtoenterology in Europe whereas MLN02 ( anti-alpha417 ) has a good profile in terms of efficacy and safety . Monoclonal anti bodies targeting other cytokines are under development , mainly ustekinumab which inhibits IL12 and IL23 . Ustekinumab generates favourable clinical responses in Crohn 's disease . The development of biologic therapies in inflammatory bowel disease has dramatically altered the course and management of these disorders .
