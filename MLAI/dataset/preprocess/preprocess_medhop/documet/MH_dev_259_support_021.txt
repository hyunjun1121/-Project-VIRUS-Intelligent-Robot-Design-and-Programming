Evidence for protein tyrosine phosphatase , tyrosine kinase , and G-protein regulation of the parallel fiber metabotropic slow EPSC of rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons . The slow EPSP ( sEPSP ) or slow EPSC ( sEPSC ) at parallel fiber to Purkinje neuron synapses is attributable to a nonselective cation channel coupled to activation of metabotropic type 1 glutamate receptors ( mGluR1s ) . Photorelease of L-glutamate in 1 msec from 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-or 7-nitroindolinyl-caged glutamate in cerebellar slices was used to isolate and study postsynaptic mechanisms coupling Q13255 to the cation channel . DB00142 immediately activated a glutamate transporter current , followed by the slow Q13255 -activated conductance . Inhibitors of kinases , phosphatases , and G-proteins were tested on the peak glutamate-evoked currents . No effects of the inhibitors were seen on the initial glutamate transporter currents . In contrast , the later Q13255 currents were either unaffected or enhanced by the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitors P50391 , K252a , and staurosporine were diminished or blocked by phosphatase inhibitors but were unaffected by inhibitors of serine-threonine kinases PKA , PKC , or PKG . The selective src-PTK inhibitor P50391 ( 10 microm intracellularly ) potentiated submaximal Q13255 currents evoked by low L-glutamate concentrations but had no effect on maximal responses ( 80 or 160 microm L-glutamate ) . DB00142 -evoked Q13255 currents and parallel fiber sEPSCs were reversibly and completely inhibited by protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) inhibitor bpV(phen) ( 50-200 microm ) and by nonselective phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate ( 0.5 or 1 mm ) . Q13255 currents were completely inhibited by GDPbetaS applied intracellularly ( 5 mm ) . The results confirm a role for a GTPase postsynaptically , show that tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits Q13255 coupling to the channel , and show that PTPs increase activation by tyrosine dephosphorylation most likely upstream of the sEPSP cation channel .
