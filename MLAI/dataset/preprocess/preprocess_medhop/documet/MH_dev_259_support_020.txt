Inhibition of human steroid 5beta-reductase ( P51857 ) by finasteride and structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex . The Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in nearly all steroid hormones apart from estrogens . The first step in functionalization of the A-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5alpha- or 5beta-reductase . DB01216 is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5alpha-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia . It is also used for androgen deprivation in hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma , and it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer . The effect of finasteride on steroid 5beta-reductase ( P51857 ) has not been previously reported . We show that finasteride competitively inhibits P51857 with low micromolar affinity but does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator . The structure of the P51857 .NADP(+)*finasteride complex determined at 1.7 A resolution shows that it is not possible for NADPH to reduce the Delta(1-2)-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not proximal to each other . The P01024 -ketone of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues DB00135 -58 and DB00142 -120 in the active site of P51857 , providing an explanation for the competitive inhibition observed . This is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism .
