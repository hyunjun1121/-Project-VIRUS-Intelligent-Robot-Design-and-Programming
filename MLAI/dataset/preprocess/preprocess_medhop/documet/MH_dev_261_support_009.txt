Exploring schizophrenia drug-gene interactions through molecular network and pathway modeling . In this study , we retrieved 39 schizophrenia-related antipsychotic drugs from the DrugBank database . These drugs had interactions with 142 targets , whose corresponding genes were defined as drug targeted genes . To explore the complexity between these drugs and their related genes in schizophrenia , we constructed a drug-target gene network . These genes were overrepresented in several pathways including : neuroactive ligand-receptor pathways , glutamate metabolism , and glycine metabolism . Through integrating the pathway information into a drug-gene network , we revealed a few bridge genes connected the sub-networks of the drug-gene network : Q12879 , O60391 , Q14957 , Q13224 , P21728 , and P14416 . These genes encode ionotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the DB01221 receptor family and dopamine receptors . DB00502 was the only drug to directly interact with these pathways and receptors and consequently may have a unique action at the drug-gene interaction level during the treatment of schizophrenia . This study represents the first systematic investigation of drug-gene interactions in psychosis .
