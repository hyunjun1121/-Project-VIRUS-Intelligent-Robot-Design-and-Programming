APRIL and Q9Y275 proteins increase proliferation of human adipose-derived stem cells through activation of Erk1/2 Q96HU1 kinase . Human adipose-derived stem cells ( Q9ULZ3 ) are DB05914 with reduced immunogenicity and the ability to modulate immune responses . APRIL and Q9Y275 proteins are overexpressed in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases for which allogeneic Q9ULZ3 therapy is currently under clinical investigation . Modification of Q9ULZ3 properties by the tissue microenvironment could be a critical factor in patient outcome and is still not well understood . Our aim was to characterize the APRIL/ Q9Y275 system in Q9ULZ3 by analyzing the ligand and receptor expression patterns , the effects mediated by APRIL and Q9Y275 on Q9ULZ3 , and the underlying signaling . We found that Q9ULZ3 express the tumor necrosis factor proteins APRIL ( a proliferation-inducing ligand ) and Q9Y275 ( B cell-activator factor ) as well as their receptors O14836 ( transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor ) , Q02223 ( B cell maturation antigen ) and the Q9Y275 -specific receptor ( Q96RJ3 ) . APRIL and Q9Y275 secretion was differentially enhanced by P48061 and interferon ( IFN ) -Î³ , implicated in Q9ULZ3 -mediated migration and immunosuppression , respectively . In addition , APRIL and Q9Y275 induced rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) and Akt kinases and promoted an increase in Q9ULZ3 proliferation , without affecting the immunosuppressive capacity of these cells . The use of specific chemical inhibitors indicated that the PI3K transduction pathway is involved in Q9ULZ3 basal growth and that APRIL- and Q9Y275 -mediated effects are P29323 -dependent . These results provide new information about the molecular mechanisms that underlie APRIL and Q9Y275 secretion and signaling in Q9ULZ3 , and are of special relevance for the use of allogeneic Q9ULZ3 as therapeutic tools .
