Regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis by thrombopoietin and stromal cells . P40225 ( Tpo ) is a cytokine which stimulates megakaryocyte maturation . We found that Tpo is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined , including bone marrow stromal cells , even in thrombocytopenia , thrombosis and steady-state condition in mice . Thus , platelet level in circulation is not regulated by Tpo gene expression . Furthermore , when the purified megakaryocytes were cocultured with the stromal cells , most of the megakaryocytes adhered to the stromal cells and remained unchanged , while free megakaryocytes induced proplatelet formation . Thus the stromal cells in bone marrow secrete Tpo and stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis , but the interaction of megakaryocytes with the stromal cells may suppress platelet formation . Study on signal transduction through Q9UHA4 revealed that Tpo induces activation of O60674 and Tyk2 , which in turn activate P42224 , P40763 and P42229 . Further , Tpo stimulates transcription factors P15976 and NF-E2 , which induce differentiation markers , P08514 /IIIa and Pm-1 . In addition , Shc , Vav , Ras , P04049 , MAPKK , MAPK and Pim-1 are also activated . Thus , Tpo activates a lineage-specific cascade as well as a specific JAK- P35610 cascade and a common signaling cascade .
