Clinical and biological consequences of immunization to infliximab in pediatric Crohn 's disease . P01375 ( P01375 ) -alpha plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of Crohn 's disease , a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract . DB00065 , a chimeric monoclonal antibody blocking P01375 , has proven effective as an induction and maintenance therapy for refractory Crohn 's disease in adult and pediatric patients . However , infliximab therapy induces the appearance of neutralizing anti-infliximab antibodies . In the pediatric cohort , we analyzed ( n=28 ) sensitization occurred in 35.7 % patients and was associated with a loss of response to maintenance infusions . In two patients presenting high titers of anti-infliximab antibodies , severe infusion reactions were observed , possibly IgE-mediated , precluding further use of the medication . Serum concentrations of P01375 and infliximab were influenced by the presence of anti-infliximab antibodies . We propose that surveillance of circulating infliximab and/or P01375 concentration during maintenance therapy represents an indirect but reliable method to monitor anti-infliximab immunization .
