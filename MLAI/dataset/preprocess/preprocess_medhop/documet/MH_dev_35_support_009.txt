Discovery and structure-activity relationship of ( 1R ) -8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-methyl-1H-3-benzazepine ( DB04871 ) , a selective serotonin P28335 receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity . The synthesis and SAR of a novel 3-benzazepine series of P28335 agonists is described . Compound 7d ( lorcaserin , APD356 ) was identified as one of the more potent and selective compounds in vitro ( pEC50 values in functional assays measuring [(3)H]phosphoinositol turnover : P28335 = 8.1 ; 5- Q13049 = 6.8 ; P41595 = 6.1 ) and was potent in an acute in vivo rat food intake model upon oral administration ( ED50 at 6 h = 18 mg/kg ) . DB04871 was further characterized in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in rat ( t1/2 = 3.7 h ; F = 86 % ) and a 28-day model of weight gain in growing Sprague-Dawley rat ( 8.5 % decrease in weight gain observed at 36 mg/kg b.i.d. ) . DB04871 was selected for further evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity .
