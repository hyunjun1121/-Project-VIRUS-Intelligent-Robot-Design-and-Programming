[ Optimalisation of treatment with vitamin K antagonists -- the role of gene polymorphisms ] . The magnitude of a maintenance vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) dose during anticoagulant therapy depends not only on clinical , environmental , and demographic factors , but also on genetic factors . Known genetic polymorphisms explain 40-50 % of the variance in VKA dosing . Polymorphisms of two genes encoding enzymes involved in vitamin K and/or VKA metabolism such as vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ( Q9BQB6 ) and cytochrome P450 2C9 isoform ( P11712 ) play a key role in this variance . Polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 4F2 isoform ( P78329 ) , apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) and gamma-glutamyl carboxylase ( P38435 ) are of minor or negligible importance . In European populations , 3 haplotypes of Q9BQB6 , Q9BQB6 *2 , Q9BQB6 *3 and Q9BQB6 *4 -- have been identified and they determined 99 % of genetic variability of this enzyme . The presence of -1639G > A Q9BQB6 polymorphism is associated with increased VKA dose requirements . Allelic variants of P11712 *2 and P11712 *3 ( found in 8-12 % and 3-8 % of individuals , respectively ) increase the risk of haemorrhage due to slow VKA metabolism , especially at the therapy initiation . Pharmacogenetic algorithms incorporating Q9BQB6 and P11712 genotypes help to predict the VKA dosage , particularly if the dose requirements are low or moderate . However , there is no compelling evidence showing reduced risk for clinical adverse events during VKA therapy following the identification of the patient 's genetic profile .
