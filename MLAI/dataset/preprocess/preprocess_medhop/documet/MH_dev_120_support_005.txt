P50591 -deficiency accelerates vascular calcification in atherosclerosis via modulation of O14788 . The osteoprotegerin ( O00300 ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand ( O14788 ) cytokine system , not only controls bone homeostasis , but has been implicated in regulating vascular calcification . P50591 ( P50591 ) is a second ligand for O00300 , and although its effect in vascular calcification in vitro is controversial , its role in vivo is not yet established . This study aimed to investigate the role of P50591 in vascular calcification in vitro using vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) isolated from P50591 (-/-) and wild-type mice , as well as in vivo , in advanced atherosclerotic lesions of P50591 (-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice . The involvement of O00300 and O14788 in this process was also examined . P50591 dose-dependently inhibited calcium-induced calcification of human VSMCs , while P50591 (-/-) VSMCs demonstrated accelerated calcification induced by multiple concentrations of calcium compared to wild-type cells . Consistent with this , O14788 mRNA was significantly elevated with 24 h calcium treatment , while O00300 and P50591 expression in human VSMCs was inhibited . Brachiocephalic arteries from P50591 (-/-)ApoE(-/-) and ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high fat diet for 12 w demonstrated increased chondrocyte-like cells in atherosclerotic plaque , as well as increased aortic collagen II mRNA expression in P50591 (-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice , with significant increases in calcification observed at 20 w . P50591 (-/-)ApoE(-/-) aortas also had significantly elevated O14788 , P12643 , IL-1β , and Q07869 -γ expression at 12 w . Our data provides the first evidence that P50591 deficiency results in accelerated cartilaginous metaplasia and calcification in atherosclerosis , and that P50591 plays an important role in the regulation of O14788 and inflammatory markers mediating bone turn over in the vasculature .
