Evaluation of pharmacological profile of meloxicam as an anti-inflammatory agent , with particular reference to its relative selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 . We studied the anti-inflammatory activity of meloxicam on rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy and its toxicity for rat gastric mucosa , relative to its in vitro inhibitory potency against partially purified cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 preparations in order to clarify the pharmacological profile of the compound as an anti-inflammatory agent . In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy , the plasma exudation rate peaked at 5 h , at which time P35354 was detectable in cells from the pleural exudate . Meloxicam and piroxicam ( 1 and 3 mg/kg ) and NS-398 ( 3 mg/kg ) showed almost equal anti-inflammatory potency against 5-hour pleurisy . A single oral administration of the compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of rats with gastric mucosal erosion . The ED50 value for meloxicam ( 5.92 mg/kg ) was significantly higher than that for piroxicam ( 1.76 mg/kg ) , indicating that meloxicam is safer . DB00328 showed intermediate safety ( 2.59 mg/kg ) . In in vitro experiments , indometacin inhibited P23219 about 1.7 times more potently than P35354 . NS-398 inhibited P35354 with an IC50 of 0.32 microM , but never affected P23219 activity , even at 100 microM . In the same assay system , meloxicam inhibited P35354 about 12 times more selectively than P23219 . Piroxicam , however , inhibited both isoforms almost equally . These results indicate that meloxicam is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with low gastric toxicity . One reason for its in vivo pharmacological profile may be related to its relative selectivity for P35354 over P23219 . Thus , meloxicam may belong to a group of P35354 selective anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile than conventional P23219 and P35354 nonselective anti-inflammatory agents .
