Differential regulation of MeCP2 phosphorylation in the CNS by dopamine and serotonin . Systemic administration of amphetamine ( P49418 ) induces phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421 ( pMeCP2 ) in select populations of neurons in the mesolimbocortical brain regions . Because P49418 simultaneously activates multiple monoamine neurotransmitter systems , here we examined the ability of dopamine ( DA ) , serotonin ( 5-HT ) , and norepinephrine ( NE ) to induce pMeCP2 . Selective blockade of the Q01959 ( Q01959 ) or the 5-HT transporter ( P31645 ) , but not the NE transporter ( NET ) , was sufficient to induce pMeCP2 in the CNS . Q01959 blockade induced pMeCP2 in the prelimbic cortex ( P98160 ) and nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) , whereas P31645 blockade induced pMeCP2 only in the NAc . Administration of selective DA and 5-HT receptor agonists was also sufficient to induce pMeCP2 ; however , the specific combination of DA and 5-HT receptors activated determined the regional- and cell-type specificity of pMeCP2 induction . The D(1)-class DA receptor agonist SKF81297 induced pMeCP2 widely ; however , coadministration of the D(2)-class agonist quinpirole restricted the induction of pMeCP2 to GABAergic interneurons of the NAc . Intra-striatal injection of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was sufficient to induce pMeCP2 in medium-spiny neurons , suggesting that the combinatorial regulation of DB02527 by different classes of DA and 5-HT receptors may contribute to the cell-type specificity of pMeCP2 induction . Consistent with the regulation of pMeCP2 by multiple monoamine neurotransmitters , genetic disruption of any single monoamine transporter in Q01959 - , P31645 - , and NET-knockout mice failed to eliminate P49418 -induced pMeCP2 in the NAc . Together , these studies indicate that combinatorial signaling through DA and 5-HT receptors can regulate the brain region- and cell-type specific pMeCP2 in the CNS .
