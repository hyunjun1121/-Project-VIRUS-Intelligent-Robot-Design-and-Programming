Metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by human cytochromes P450 2D6 and 3A4 . DB00734 is a relatively new antipsychotic drug that has been reported to improve both the positive and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and produces relatively few extrapyramidal side effects at low doses . Formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone , an active metabolite , is the most important metabolic pathway of risperidone in human . In the present study , in vitro metabolism of risperidone ( 100 microM ) was investigated using the recombinant human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes P04798 , P05177 , P10632 , P11712 -arg144 , P11712 -cys144 , P33261 , P10635 , P08684 and P20815 supplemented with an NADPH-generating system . DB01267 was determined by a new HPLC method with an Hypersil CN column and a UV detector . Of these enzymes , CYPs 2D6 , 3A4 and 3A5 were found to be the ones capable of metabolising risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone , with activities of 7.5 , 0.4 and 0.2 pmol pmol(-1) CYP min(-1) , respectively . A correlation study using a panel of human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with P10635 and 3A activities . Thus , both P10635 and 3A4 are involved in the 9-hydroxylation of risperidone at the concentration of risperidone used in this study . This observation is confirmed by the findings that both quinidine ( inhibitor of P10635 ) and ketoconazole ( inhibitor of P08684 ) can inhibit the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone . Furthermore , inducers of CYP can significantly increase the formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in rat . The formation of 9-hydroxyrisperidone is highly correlated with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activities , suggesting that inducible CYP3A contributes significantly to the metabolism of risperidone in rat .
