Impact of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the Q07869 -gamma2 gene on serum triacylglycerol response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation . Serum lipid responses to dietary modification are partly determined by genetic factors . The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 ( Q07869 -gamma2 ) gene on serum lipid and lipoprotein responses to n-3 fatty acid supplementation . A total of 76 men and 74 women ( age 49+/-8 years , body mass index 26.5+/-3.0 kg/m(2) ) participated in a controlled multi-center study . Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either fish oil supplements ( 3.6g n-3 fatty acids/day containing 2.4 g of EPA and DB01708 ) or placebo capsules containing olive oil for 3 months . At baseline , the Pro12Ala polymorphism was not associated with serum total and lipoprotein lipid concentrations or lipoprotein lipase activity in the fasting state . After the 3-month study period , carriers of the Ala12 allele presented a greater decrease in serum triacylglycerol concentration in response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation than did subjects with the Pro12Pro genotype when the total dietary fat intake was below 37 E % ( p=0.003 ) or the intake of saturated fatty acids was below 10 E % ( p=0.006 ) . Changes in serum total cholesterol , serum LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations were similar among the genotypes in the n-3 fatty acid supplementation group and in the placebo group . In conclusion , the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the Q07869 -gamma2 gene may modify the inter-individual variability in serum triacylglycerol response to n-3 fatty acid supplementation .
