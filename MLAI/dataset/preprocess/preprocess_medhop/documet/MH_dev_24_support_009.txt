Q07973 as a potential target for cancer therapy . Increasing evidence has accumulated to suggest that vitamin D may reduce the risk of cancer through its biologically active metabolite , DB00136 , which inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis , induces differentiation and apoptosis , and regulates many other cellular functions . Thus , it is plausible to assume that rapid clearance of DB00136 by highly expressed Q07973 could interrupt the normal physiology of cells and might be one cause of cancer initiation and progression . In fact , enhancement of Q07973 expression has been reported in literature for many cancers . Based on these findings , Q07973 -specific inhibitors and vitamin D analogs which are resistant to Q07973 -dependent catabolism might be useful for cancer treatment . Q07973 -specific inhibitor VID400 , which is an azole compound , markedly enhanced and prolonged the antiproliferative activity of DB00136 in the human keratinocytes . Likewise , Q07973 -resistant analogs such as 2α-(3-hydroxypropoxy)- DB00136 ( O2C3 ) and its P06681 -epimer ED-71 ( DB05295 ) , and 19nor- 2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)- DB00136 ( MART-10 ) showed potent biological effects . Our in vivo studies using rats revealed that MART-10 had a low calcemic effect , which is a suitable property as an anticancer drug . Much lower affinity of MART-10 for vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) as compared with DB00136 may be related to its more potent cellular activities . Based on these results , we conclude that ( 1 ) high affinity for P11473 , ( 2 ) resistance to Q07973 -dependent catabolism , ( 3 ) low affinity for DBP , and ( 4 ) low calcemic effect may be required for designing potent vitamin D analogs for cancer treatment .
