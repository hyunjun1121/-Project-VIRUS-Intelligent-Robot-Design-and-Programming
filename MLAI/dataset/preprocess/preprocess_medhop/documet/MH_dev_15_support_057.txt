Novel withanolides target medullary thyroid cancer through inhibition of both P07949 phosphorylation and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway . BACKGROUND : Despite development of current targeted therapies for medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) , long-term survival remains unchanged . Recently isolated novel withanolide compounds from Solanaceae physalis are highly potent against MTCs . We hypothesize that these withanolides uniquely inhibit P07949 phosphorylation and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway in P04629 cells as a mechanism of antiproliferation and apoptosis . METHODS : P04629 cells were treated with novel withanolides and P04629 -targeted drugs . In vitro studies assessed cell viability and proliferation ( MTS ; trypan blue assays ) , apoptosis ( flow cytometry with P08758 /PI staining ; confirmed by Western blot analysis ) , long-term cytotoxic effects ( clonogenic assay ) , and suppression of key regulatory proteins such as P07949 , Akt , and P42345 ( by Western blot analysis ) . RESULTS : The novel withanolides potently reduced P04629 cell viability ( half maximal inhibitory concentration [ IC(50) ] , 270-2,850 nmol/L ; 250-1,380 nmol/L for vandetanib ; 360-1,640 nmol/L for cabozantinib ) with induction of apoptosis at < 1,000 nmol/L of drug . Unique from other targeted therapies , withanolides suppressed P07949 and Akt phosphorylation and protein expression ( in a concentration- and time-dependent manner ) as well as P42345 activity and translational activity of Q13541 and protein synthesis mediated by p70S6kinase activation at IC(50) concentrations . CONCLUSION : Novel withanolides from Physalis selectively and potently inhibit P04629 cells in vitro . Unlike other P04629 -targeted therapies , these compounds uniquely inhibit both P07949 kinase activity and the Akt/ P42345 prosurvival pathway . Further translational studies are warranted to evaluate their clinical potential .
