P01308 action on H292 bronchial carcinoma cells as compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells . DB00030 may contribute to bronchial carcinoma due to P08069 activation by high local concentrations . Therefore , effects of insulin and P05019 on human bronchial carcinoma cells ( H292 ) and normal bronchial epithelium cells ( P02100 ) were studied . TGF-β was included since it also influences carcinoma progression . H292 and P02100 cells expressed both the insulin receptor and the P08069 ; in H292 cells an additional , shorter , splicing variant ( IR-A ) of the insulin receptor was present . P06213 expression was around four to five times higher in H292 than in P02100 cells at mRNA and protein levels . P01308 and TGF-β exerted contrary actions on proliferation and gene expression in H292 cells . Genes regulated by insulin , P05019 , and TGF-β were linked to inflammation , cell adhesion , muscle contraction and differentiation . P01308 and P05019 also suppressed DNA repair genes . EC(50) for insulin-induced proliferation was around 5 nM in H292 and around 30 nM P02100 cells . The EC(50) values for gene expression ranged from 9 to 90 nM in both cell types , dependent on the gene studied . In H292 cells , the proliferative response was much stronger if TGF-β was present . In P02100 cells this interaction of insulin and TGF-β was not observed , and changes in gene expression were mostly lower by at least 10-fold as compared to H292 . All in all , the insulin effects in H292 were generally much stronger than in P02100 cells and - with regard to proliferation - occurred at lower concentrations . Thus , insulin will hardly induce cancer from normal bronchial cells but may favour progression of pre-existing tumours .
