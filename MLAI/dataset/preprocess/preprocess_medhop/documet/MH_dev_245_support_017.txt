DB00134 -dependence phenotype in the de novo pathway in P38398 and P51587 mutation carriers with and without breast cancer . DB00134 -dependence phenotype ( P16444 ) refers to the reduced ability of cells to proliferate when methionine is restricted and/or replaced by its immediate precursor homocysteine . P16444 is a characteristic of human tumors in vivo , human tumor cell lines , and normal somatic tissue in some individuals . It was hypothesized that P16444 is a risk factor for developing breast cancer in BRCA ( P38398 and P51587 ) germline mutation carriers . To test the hypothesis , human peripheral blood lymphocytes of BRCA carriers with and without breast cancer and healthy non-carrier relatives ( controls ) were cultured for 9 days in medium containing either 0.1 mmol/L L-methionine or 0.2 mmol/L D,L-homocysteine , with the ratio of viable cell growth in both types of medium after 9 days used to calculate the methionine-dependence index ( MDI ) , a measure of P16444 . We also tested whether P16444 was associated with common polymorphisms in methionine metabolism . Viable cell growth , MDI , and polymorphism frequency in Q9UBK8 ( A66G and C524T ) and P42898 ( A1298C and A1793G ) did not differ among the study groups ; however , MDI tended to be higher in BRCA carriers with breast cancer than those without and was significantly increased in P42898 677T allele carriers relative to wild-type carriers ( P=0.017 ) . The presence of Q99707 A2756G mutant allele and P42898 C677T mutant allele in carriers was associated with increased breast cancer risk [ odds ration , 3.2 ( P=0.16 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.76-13.9 ) and 3.9 ( P=0.09 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.93-16.3 ) , respectively ] . The results of this study support the hypothesis that defects in methionine metabolism may be associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA carriers .
