Distinct binding mode of multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib revealed by biochemical characterization . DB09078 is an oral multikinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) receptors 1 to 3 and other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related receptor tyrosine kinases . To elucidate the origin of the potency of lenvatinib in P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) inhibition , we conducted a kinetic interaction analysis of lenvatinib with P35968 and X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of P35968 -lenvatinib complexes . Kinetic analysis revealed that lenvatinib had a rapid association rate constant and a relatively slow dissociation rate constant in complex with P35968 . Co-crystal structure analysis demonstrated that lenvatinib binds at its DB00171 mimetic quinoline moiety to the DB00171 binding site and to the neighboring region via a cyclopropane ring , adopting an DB00128 - DB00120 - DB00145 ( DFG ) - " in " conformation . These results suggest that lenvatinib is very distinct in its binding mode of interaction compared to the several approved P35968 kinase inhibitors .
