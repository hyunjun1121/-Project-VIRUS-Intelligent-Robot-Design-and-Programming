[ Peptide fragments of chemokine domain of fractalkine : effect on human monocyte migration ] . Leukocyte chemotaxis to the area of tissue damage is mediated by chemokines . According to the primary structure , chemokines are divided into four families , fractalkine ( P78423 ) is the only one member of CX3C family and the only membrane-bound chemokine . P78423 molecule includes the extracellular N-terminal chemokine domain , mucin-like rod , the transmembrane and the intracellular domains . In membrane-bound state fractalkine has the properties of an adhesion molecule . Chemokine domain of fractalkine ( P05231 ) is released from cell membrane by proteolysis , and this soluble form acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes expressing fractalkine receptor P49238 . P78423 is involved in development of a number of pathological processes caused by inflammation , and therefore a search for fractalkine inhibitors is very important . For this purpose we identified several antigenic determinants -- the fragments of P05231 , and the following peptides were synthesized -- P41-52 H- DB00149 - DB00142 - DB00156 - DB00125 -Gln- DB00117 - DB00125 - DB00149 - DB00120 - DB00151 -Ala- DB00128 -NH2 , P04637 -60 H-Pro-Lys- DB00142 -Gln- DB00150 - DB00161 -Lys- DB00128 -NH2 and O14879 -71 H- DB00128 -Ala- DB00134 -Gln- DB00117 - DB00149 - DB00128 - DB00125 -Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-NH2 . The peptide effects on adhesion and migration of human peripheral blood monocytes expressing fractalkine receptors were investigated . In the presence of P05231 and P41-52 we observed the increased adhesion and migration of monocytes compared with spontaneous values . Peptides P04637 -60 and O14879 -71 significantly inhibited monocyte adhesion and migration stimulated by P05231 . Since the chemotactic activity of chemokines was shown to be dependent on their binding to glycosaminoglycans of the cell surface and extracellular matrix , the effect ofpeptides on the interaction of P05231 with heparin was analyzed by ELISA . Peptide P41-52 competed with P05231 for heparin binding , while peptides P04637 -60 and O14879 -71 had no significant activity .
