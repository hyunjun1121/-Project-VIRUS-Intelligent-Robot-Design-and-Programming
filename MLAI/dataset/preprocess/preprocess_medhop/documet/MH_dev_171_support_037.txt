Blood flow alterations in TNBS-induced colitis : role of endothelin receptors . OBJECTIVES : The aim of the present study was to investigate the time dependent changes in hemodynamic parameters and to assess the role of endothelin ( ET ) receptors in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( TNBS ) induced colitis . MATERIALS : Inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA ) hemodynamics , myeloperoxidase activity ( P05164 ) and damage scores were measured immediately or 1 , 3 , 5 and 14 days after colitis . TREATMENTS : Another group of rats received a nonselective ET receptor antagonist DB00559 ( 30 mg/kg/day ) , P25101 receptor antagonist BQ485 ( 60 microg/rat/day ) or P24530 receptor antagonist BQ788 ( 60 microg/rat/day ) prior to and on the 1st , 2nd and 3rd days after TNBS administration . RESULTS : IMA flow significantly increased at 90 min followed by a substantial decrease through days 1-5 . Tissue P05164 activity and macroscopic damage score increased on 1st day after the induction of colitis and remained elevated 3 , 5 and 14 days following colitis . Treatment with DB00559 or P25101 receptor antagonist largely prevented the colitis-induced reduction in blood flow and tissue injury whereas P24530 receptor antagonist did not attenuate tissue injury or reductions in blood flow . CONCLUSIONS : Our results demonstrate that time-dependent abnormalities occur in IMA hemodynamics following TNBS administration . Our findings also indicate that P25101 receptors but not P24530 receptors play an important role in the colonic inflammation following TNBS administration .
