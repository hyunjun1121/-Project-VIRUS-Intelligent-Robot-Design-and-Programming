A novel pathway links oxidative stress to loss of insulin growth factor-2 ( P01344 ) imprinting through NF-κB activation . Genomic imprinting is the allele-specific expression of a gene based on parental origin . Loss of imprinting(LOI) of P01308 -like Growth Factor 2 ( P01344 ) during aging is important in tumorigenesis , yet the regulatory mechanisms driving this event are largely unknown . In this study oxidative stress , measured by increased NF-κB activity , induces LOI in both cancerous and noncancerous human prostate cells . Decreased expression of the enhancer-blocking element CCCTC-binding factor( P49711 ) results in reduced binding of P49711 to the H19-ICR ( imprint control region ) , a major factor in the allelic silencing of P01344 . This ICR then develops increased DNA methylation . Assays identify a recruitment of the canonical pathway proteins NF-κB p65 and p50 to the P49711 promoter associated with the co-repressor Q13547 explaining gene repression . An IκBα super-repressor blocks oxidative stress-induced activation of NF-κB and P01344 imprinting is maintained . In vivo experiments using IκBα mutant mice with continuous NF-κB activation demonstrate increased P01344 LOI further confirming a central role for canonical NF-κB signaling . We conclude P49711 plays a central role in mediating the effects of NF-κB activation that result in altered imprinting both in vitro and in vivo . This novel finding connects inflammation found in aging prostate tissues with the altered epigenetic landscape .
