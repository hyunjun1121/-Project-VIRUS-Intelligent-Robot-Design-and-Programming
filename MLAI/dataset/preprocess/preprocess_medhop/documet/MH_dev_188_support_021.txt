P01133 receptor-related protein ( ERRP ) inhibits invasion of colon cancer cells and tubule formation by endothelial cells in vitro . Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and/or its family member(s) stimulates many processes of carcinogenesis , including cell invasion and the formation of new blood vessels , events that are critically involved in angiogenesis . Interference with the activation of EGFRs , therefore , represents a promising strategy for the development of novel and selective anticancer therapies . Previously , we reported that P00533 -related protein ( ERRP ) , which we have isolated and characterized as a pan-erbB inhibitor , is a potential therapeutic agent for colorectal and other epithelial cancers . The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether ERRP would affect the invasion of colon cancer cells and formation of tubules , and the regulation of these processes . ERRP inhibited tubule formation by aortic endothelial cells and invasion of HCT-116 colon cancer cells through matrigel . These changes were associated with marked reductions in the synthesis and secretion of P09038 , P15692 and TGF-alpha by HCT-116 cells . Secretion of P09038 and P15692 by aortic endothelial cells was also inhibited by ERRP . Microarray analysis of ERRP-treated HCT-116 cells showed reduced levels of several growth regulatory proteins such as p21Rac1 , P31947 ( 14-3-3 Sigma ) , focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) and mediators of the Ras-Raf- P29323 pathway . ERRP treatments resulted in reduced expression of p21Rac1 and inhibited the constitutive activation of Q05397 and P36507 in HCT-116 cells . Transfection of constitutively activate p21Rac1 or P36507 into HCT-116 cells abrogated ERRP-induced inhibition of growth . In summary , it was demonstrated that ERRP not only inhibits cell growth , but also the processes of cell invasion and blood vessel formation that are critical for the development and progression of carcinogenesis .
