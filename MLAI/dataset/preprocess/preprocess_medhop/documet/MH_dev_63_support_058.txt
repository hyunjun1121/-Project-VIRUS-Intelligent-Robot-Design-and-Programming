Genetic determinants of serum lipid levels in Chinese subjects : a population-based study in Shanghai , China . We examined the associations between 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of eight lipid metabolism genes and lipid levels in a Chinese population . This study was conducted as part of a population-based study in China with 799 randomly selected healthy residents who provided fasting blood and an in-person interview . Associations between variants and mean lipid levels were examined using a test of trend and least squares mean test in a general linear model . Four SNPs were associated with lipid levels : P01130 rs1003723 was associated with total cholesterol ( P-trend = 0.002 ) and LDL ( P-trend = 0.01 ) , P01130 rs6413503 was associated with total cholesterol ( P-trend = 0.05 ) , P04114 rs1367117 was associated with apoB ( P-trend = 0.02 ) , and O95342 rs49550 was associated with total cholesterol ( P-trend = 0.01 ) , triglycerides ( P-trend = 0.01 ) , and apoA ( P-trend = 0.01 ) . We found statistically significant effects on lipid levels for P01130 rs6413503 among those with high dairy intake , P06858 rs263 among those with high allium vegetable intake , and P02649 rs440446 among those with high red meat intake . We identified new associations between SNPs and lipid levels in Chinese previously found in Caucasians . These findings provide insight into the role of lipid metabolism genes , as well as the mechanisms by which these genes may be linked with disease .
