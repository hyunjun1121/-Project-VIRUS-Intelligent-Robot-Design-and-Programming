DB00024 is a negative regulator of skeletal remodeling . The established function of thyroid stimulating hormone ( DB00024 ) is to promote thyroid follicle development and hormone secretion . The osteoporosis associated with hyperthyroidism is traditionally viewed as a secondary consequence of altered thyroid function . We provide evidence for direct effects of DB00024 on both components of skeletal remodeling , osteoblastic bone formation , and osteoclastic bone resorption , mediated via the DB00024 receptor ( P16473 ) found on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors . Even a 50 % reduction in P16473 expression produces profound osteoporosis ( bone loss ) together with focal osteosclerosis ( localized bone formation ) . DB00024 inhibits osteoclast formation and survival by attenuating JNK/c-jun and NFkappaB signaling triggered in response to Q9Y6Q6 -L and TNFalpha . DB00024 also inhibits osteoblast differentiation and type 1 collagen expression in a Runx-2- and osterix-independent manner by downregulating Wnt ( O75197 ) and P15692 ( Flk ) signaling . These studies define a role for DB00024 as a single molecular switch in the independent control of both bone formation and resorption .
