M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukaemias display a high sensitivity to DB00188 -mediated apoptosis . The present study explored the sensitivity of leukaemic blasts derived from 30 acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) patients to DB00188 . DB00188 induced apoptosis of primary AML blasts : 18/30 AMLs were clearly sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of DB00188 , while the remaining cases were moderately sensitive to this molecule . The addition of tumour necrosis factor-related-apoptosis-inducing ligand , when used alone , did not induce apoptosis of AML blasts and further potentiated the cytotoxic effects of DB00188 . The majority of AMLs sensitive to DB00188 showed immunophenotypic features of the M4 and M5 French-American-British classification subtypes and displayed myelomonocytic features . All AMLs with mutated P36888 were in the DB00188 -sensitive group . Biochemical studies showed that : ( i ) DB00188 activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 and decreased cellular Q14790 [ Fas-associated death domain ( Q13158 ) -like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme ] -inhibitory protein ( O15519 ) levels in AML blasts ; ( ii ) high O15519 levels in AML blasts were associated with low DB00188 sensitivity . Finally , analysis of the effects of DB00188 on leukaemic cells displaying high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity suggested that this drug induced in vitro killing of leukaemic stem cells . The findings of the present study , further support the development of DB00188 as an anti-leukaemic drug and provide simple tools to predict the sensitivity of AML cells to this drug .
