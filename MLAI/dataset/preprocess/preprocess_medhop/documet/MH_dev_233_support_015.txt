Solution structure and backbone dynamics of the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-2 complexed with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor . P08253 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family that has been implicated in tumor cell metastasis and angiogenesis . Here , we describe the solution structure of a catalytic domain of P08253 complexed with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor ( DB01630 ) , determined by three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy . The catalytic domain , designated MMP-2C , has a short peptide linker replacing the internal fibronectin-domain insertion and is enzymatically active . Distance geometry-simulated annealing calculations yielded 14 converged structures with atomic root-mean-square deviations ( r.m.s.d. ) of 1.02 and 1.62 A from the mean coordinate positions for the backbone and for all heavy atoms , respectively , when 11 residues at the N-terminus are excluded . The structure has the same global fold as observed for other MMP catalytic domains and is similar to previously solved crystal structures of P08253 . Differences observed between the solution and the crystal structures , near the bottom of the S1 ' specificity loop , appear to be induced by the large inhibitor present in the solution structure . The MMP-2C solution structure is compared with P22894 crystal structure bound to the same inhibitor to highlight the differences especially in the S1 ' specificity loop . The finding provides a structural explanation for the selectivity between P08253 and P22894 that is achieved by large inhibitors .
