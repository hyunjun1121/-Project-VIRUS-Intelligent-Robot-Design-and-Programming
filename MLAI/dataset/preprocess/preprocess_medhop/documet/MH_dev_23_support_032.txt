DB01169 -mediated antiplatelet activity : pivotal role of the phospholipase C gamma 2-protein kinase C-p38 MAPK cascade . DB01169 produces high rates of complete clinical remission in patients with relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia . Platelet activation is relevant in a variety of acute thrombotic events and coronary heart diseases . Few studies have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on platelets , and the mechanisms underlying the signaling pathways remain obscure . The aim of this study was to examine systematically the detailed mechanisms of arsenic trioxide in preventing platelet activation . DB01169 ( 5 micromol/L ) exhibited more potent activity at inhibiting collagen ( 1 microg/mL ) -induced platelet aggregation than other agonists . DB01169 ( 15 and 25 micromol/L ) inhibited collagen-induced platelet activation accompanied by [Ca(+2)]i mobilization , thromboxane A(2) ( TxA(2) ) formation , phospholipase C ( P98160 )gamma 2 phosphorylation , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation . DB01169 ( 15 and 25 micromol/L ) did not significantly affect cyclic nucleotide-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation . Moreover , arsenic trioxide markedly inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) but not P45983 /2 or P28482 phosphorylation in washed platelets . DB01169 also markedly reduced hydroxyl radical ( OH(.) ) formation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( P03372 ) study . The most important findings of this study suggest that the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide possibly involves inhibition of the P98160 gamma 2-PKC-p38 MAPK cascade , thereby leading to inhibition of [Ca(+2)]i or free radical formation , and finally the inhibition of platelet aggregation .
