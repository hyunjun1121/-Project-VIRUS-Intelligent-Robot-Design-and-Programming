Meta-analysis of oral DB00669 therapy for migraine : number needed to treat and relative cost to achieve relief within 2 hours . OBJECTIVE : To determine the cost-effectiveness of the P28222 /1D agonists , or triptans , in the acute treatment of migraine . METHODS : To determine the cost-effectiveness of the triptans , a meta-analysis was conducted of the efficacy data from 27 oral DB00669 trials , using the endpoint of " pain-free " status within 2 hours after initial dosing as the indicator of efficacy . Efficacy data were used to determine the number needed to treat ( Q13423 ) to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose and then applied the per-dose costs for each DB00669 to the Q13423 values . RESULTS : Rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg were the most cost-effective of the triptans , costing $ 48.34 and $ 48.57 US dollars , respectively , to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose . DB00998 2.5 mg was the most costly , with a cost-effective ratio of $ 162.49 US dollars . All other triptans fell between these extremes : zolmitriptan 5 mg ( $ 65.18 US dollars ) , sumatriptan 100 mg ( $ 70.83 US dollars ) , sumatriptan 50 mg ( $ 75.67 US dollars ) , zolmitriptan 2.5 mg ( $ 78.74 US dollars ) , and naratriptan 2.5 mg ( $ 141.43 US dollars ) , in decreasing order of cost-effectiveness . CONCLUSION : Using an Q13423 analysis , the least-costly drugs to achieve migraine cure within 2 hours are rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg . From a population health perspective , the lower acquisition cost of almotriptan 12.5 mg allows for effective treatment of more patients than rizatriptan 10 mg for no additional medication cost .
