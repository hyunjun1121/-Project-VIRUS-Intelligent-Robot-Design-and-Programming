Cytokine profile in the endometrium of normal fertile and women with repeated implantation failure . BACKGROUND : Repeated Implantation Failure ( Q9HBH0 ) is one of the most intricate obstacles in assisted reproduction . The cytokine and chemokine composition of uterine cavity seem to play important roles in the implantation process . OBJECTIVE : To compare the cytokine profile in the endometrium of normal fertile women and those with repeated implantation failure . METHODS : After enzymatic digestion of endometrial tissues , whole endometrial cells and endometrial stromal cells from Q9HBH0 and normal fertile women were cultivated and stimulated for cytokine secretion . The levels of P22301 , TGF-β , IFN-γ , P05231 , P10145 and Q16552 in culture supernatants of the two groups were assayed by ELISA and compared together . RESULTS : Endometrial stromal cells and whole endometrial cells of normal fertile women produced higher levels of P05231 , P10145 and TGF-β compared to Q9HBH0 group , although this difference was statistically significant only in endometrial stromal cells ( p=0.005 , 0.002 and 0.001 , respectively ) . In addition , endometrial stromal cells of normal fertile women produced lower levels of P22301 in comparison with Q9HBH0 group ( p=0.005 ) . CONCLUSION : Disturbances in cytokine production at the feto-maternal interface could be a cause of implantation failure . A pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu seems to be pivotal for successful implantation .
