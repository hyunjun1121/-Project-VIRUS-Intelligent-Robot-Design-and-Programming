Lipoxygenase pathway mediates increases of airway resistance and lung inflation induced by exposure to nanotitanium dioxide in rats . Nanotitanium dioxide particle ( nTiO2 ) inhalation has been reported to induce lung parenchymal injury . After inhalation of nTiO2 , we monitored changes in P09917 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) mRNA in rat lung tissue . Lung function parameters include specific airway resistance ( SRaw ) , peak expiratory flow rate ( PEF ) , functional residual capacity ( FRC ) , and lung compliance ( Cchord ) ; blood white blood cell count ( WBC ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , hydrogen peroxide , and lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ; and lung lavage leukotriene C4 , interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) , tumor necrotic factor α ( TNFα ) , hydroxyl radicals , and NO . Leukotriene receptor antagonist MK571 and P09917 inhibitor MK886 were used for pharmacologic intervention . Compared to control , nTiO2 exposure induced near 5-fold increase in P09917 mRNA expression in lung tissue . P35228 mRNA increased while P29474 mRNA decreased . Lavage leukotriene C4 ; P05231 ; TNFα ; NO ; hydroxyl radicals ; and blood WBC , NO , hydrogen peroxide , and LDH levels rose . Obstructive ventilatory insufficiency was observed . MK571 and MK886 both attenuated the systemic inflammation and lung function changes . We conclude that inhaled nTiO2 induces systemic inflammation , cytokine release , and oxidative and nitrosative stress in the lung . The lipoxygenase pathway products , mediated by oxygen radicals and WBC , play a critical role in the obstructive ventilatory insufficiency induced by nTiO2 .
