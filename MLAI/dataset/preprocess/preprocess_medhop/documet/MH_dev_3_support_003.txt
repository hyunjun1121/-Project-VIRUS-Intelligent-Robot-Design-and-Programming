Regulation of DB02527 phosphodiesterase mRNAs expression in rat brain by acute and chronic fluoxetine treatment . An in situ hybridization study . Changes in brain cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) have been suggested to underlie the clinical action of antidepressant treatments . Also , a regionally-selective regulation of DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) has been demonstrated for some antidepressants . To further investigate the effects of antidepressant treatments on PDEs , we examined the expression of different DB02527 -specific PDEs in the brain of rats treated ( 1 and 14 days ) with fluoxetine 3 mg/kg day . The mRNAs coding for P27815 , Q07343 , Q08499 , and the five known Q08499 splice variants were analyzed by in situ hybridization on 45 brain structures of acute and chronic fluoxetine-treated rats . We also examined the binding sites for the putative antidepressant drug [(3)H]rolipram , a DB05876 -selective inhibitor . In some brain areas single fluoxetine administration increased the density of the mRNA of all DB05876 isozymes , except Q08499 and PDE4D5 . Chronic fluoxetine treatment increased P27815 mRNA levels and decreased those for Q07343 , Q08499 and PDE4D1 mRNAs in some brain regions . The study was complemented with the analysis of the expression of the transcripts of P23560 . Chronic fluoxetine treatment down-regulated the expression of P23560 . These results show that the expression of DB05876 isozymes is modulated by a clinically relevant fluoxetine dose . The significance of these changes in DB05876 expression to the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine is discussed .
