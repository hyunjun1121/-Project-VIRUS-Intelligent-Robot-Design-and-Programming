Involvement of sphingosine kinase in P01375 -stimulated tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis in P13671 glioma cells . In P13671 glioma cells , the sphingolipid second messenger ceramide potentiates expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase ( P35228 ) induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) without affecting P30793 ( GTPCH ) , the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 6(R)- DB00360 ( BH(4) ) , a cofactor required for P35228 activity . P01375 also stimulates sphingosine kinase , the enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate ( Q8TCT9 ) , a further metabolite of ceramide . Several clones of P13671 cells , expressing widely varying levels of sphingosine kinase , were used to examine the role of Q8TCT9 in regulation of GTPCH and BH(4) biosynthesis . Overexpression of sphingosine kinase , with concomitant increased endogenous Q8TCT9 levels , potentiated the effect of P01375 on GTPCH expression and activity and BH(4) biosynthesis . In contrast , enforced expression of sphingosine kinase had no effect on P35228 expression or NO formation . Furthermore , N,N-dimethylsphingosine , a potent sphingosine kinase inhibitor , completely eliminated the increased GTPCH activity and expression induced by P01375 . Surprisingly , we found that , although P13671 cells can secrete Q8TCT9 , which is enhanced by P01375 , treatment of P13671 cells with exogenous Q8TCT9 or dihydro- Q8TCT9 had no affect on BH(4) biosynthesis . However , both Q8TCT9 and dihydro- Q8TCT9 markedly stimulated P29323 1/2 in P13671 cells , which express cell surface Q8TCT9 receptors . Interestingly , although this P29323 activation was blocked by PD98059 , which also reduced cellular proliferation induced by enforced expression of sphingosine kinase , PD98059 had no effect on GTPCH activity . Collectively , these results suggest that only intracellularly generated Q8TCT9 plays a role in regulation of GTPCH and BH(4) levels .
