P21912 mutations are associated with response to temozolomide in patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma . Cyclophosphamide-dacarbazine-vincristine regimen is recommended for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma ( P25189 ) ; however , dacarbazine is the only recognized active drug in neuroendocrine tumours . We investigated the therapeutic benefit of temozolomide ( DB00853 ) , an oral alternative to dacarbazine , in patients with P25189 . This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients with documented progressive P25189 . We examined the correlation between DB00139 dehydrogenase B ( P21912 ) mutation and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( P16455 ) promoter methylation and P16455 expression in the French nation-wide independent cohort of 190 pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas ( PP ) . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) according to RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 criteria was the primary end point . Fifteen consecutive patients with P25189 were enrolled ; ten ( 67 % ) carried a mutation in P21912 . The mean dose intensity of DB00853 was 172 mg/m(2) /d for 5 days every 28 days . Median PFS was 13.3 months after a median follow-up of 35 months . There were five partial responses ( 33 % ) , seven stable ( 47 % ) and three progressive diseases ( 20 % ) . Grade 3 toxicities were lymphopenia in two patients and hypertension in one . Partial responses were observed only in patients with mutation in P21912 . P16455 immunohistochemistry was negative in tumour samples from four patients who responded to treatment . P21912 germline mutation was associated with hypermethylation of the P16455 promoter and low expression of P16455 in 190 samples of the French nation-wide independent cohort . This study demonstrates that DB00853 is an effective antitumour agent in patients with P21912 -related P25189 . The silencing of P16455 expression as a consequence of P16455 promoter hypermethylation in P21912 -mutated tumours may explain this finding .
