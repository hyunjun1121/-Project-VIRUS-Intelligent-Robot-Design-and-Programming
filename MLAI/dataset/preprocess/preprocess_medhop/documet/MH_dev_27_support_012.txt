Gene promoter methylation in colorectal cancer and healthy adjacent mucosa specimens : correlation with physiological and pathological characteristics , and with biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism . We evaluated the promoter methylation levels of the P25054 , P16455 , hMLH1 , RASSF1A and CDKN2A genes in 107 colorectal cancer ( CRC ) samples and 80 healthy adjacent tissues . We searched for correlation with both physical and pathological features , polymorphisms of folate metabolism pathway genes ( P42898 , Q9UBK8 , Q99707 , RFC1 , P04818 , and Q9UBC3 ) , and data on circulating folate , vitamin B12 and homocysteine , which were available in a subgroup of the CRC patients . An increased number of methylated samples were found in CRC respect to adjacent healthy tissues , with the exception of P25054 , which was also frequently methylated in healthy colonic mucosa . Statistically significant associations were found between RASSF1A promoter methylation and tumor stage , and between hMLH1 promoter methylation and tumor location . Increasing age positively correlated with both hMLH1 and P16455 methylation levels in CRC tissues , and with P25054 methylation levels in the adjacent healthy mucosa . Concerning gender , females showed higher hMLH1 promoter methylation levels with respect to males . In CRC samples , the Q99707 2756AG genotype correlated with higher methylation levels of RASSF1A , and the P04818 1494 6bp ins/del polymorphism correlated with the methylation levels of both P25054 and hMLH1 . In adjacent healthy tissues , Q99707 2756AG and P04818 1494 6bp del/del genotypes correlated with P25054 and P16455 promoter methylation , respectively . Low folate levels were associated with hMLH1 hypermethylation . Present results support the hypothesis that DNA methylation in CRC depends from both physiological and environmental factors , with one-carbon metabolism largely involved in this process .
