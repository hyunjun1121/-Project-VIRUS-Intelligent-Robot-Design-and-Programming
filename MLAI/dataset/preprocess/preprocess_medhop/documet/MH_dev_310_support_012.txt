Growth hormone deficiency in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy : relation to gross motor function and degree of spasticity . Children with Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) often have poor linear growth during childhood with short final height . Thus , we aimed to assess serum growth hormone ( GH ) , insulin like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) and insulin like growth factor binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) levels among CP patients and their relation to each of gross motor function and degree of spasticity . Fifty CP children and adolescents were studied in comparison to 50 healthy age- , sex- and pubertal stage-matched children and adolescents . All subjects were subjected to clinical evaluation , Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) assessment and measurement of serum GH , DB01277 and P17936 . All auxological and hormonal parameters were significantly lower among cases . Fifty two % of cases were GH-deficient and 62 % had reduced IGF-land P17936 levels . Gross Motor Function Measure- 88 ( GMFM-88 ) score correlated negatively with each of basal ( r = -0.71 , p = 0.02 ) and peak stimulated GH ( r =-0.88 , p = < 0.001 ) ; DB01277 ( r = -0.64 , p = 0.04 ) and P17936 ( r = -0.69 , p = 0.031 ) . There were significant negative correlations between the degree of spasticity assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale and each of basal ( r = -0.61 , p = 0.032 ) and peak stimulated GH ( r = -0.78 , p = 0.01 ) ; DB01277 ( r = -0.65 , p = 0.041 ) and P17936 ( r = -0.62 , p = 0.035 ) . Growth Hormone Deficiency ( GHD ) is prevalent in children with CP and could be one of the causes of their short stature .
