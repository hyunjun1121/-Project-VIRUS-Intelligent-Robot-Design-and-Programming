Signatures of positive selection in genes associated with human skin pigmentation as revealed from analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms . Phenotypic variation between human populations in skin pigmentation correlates with latitude at the continental level . A large number of hypotheses involving genetic adaptation have been proposed to explain human variation in skin colour , but only limited genetic evidence for positive selection has been presented . To shed light on the evolutionary genetic history of human variation in skin colour we inspected 118 genes associated with skin pigmentation in the Perlegen dataset , studying single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , and analyzed 55 genes in detail . We identified eight genes that are associated with the melanin pathway ( Q9UMX9 , Q04671 , P17643 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 , P14416 and Q03181 ) and presented significant differences in genetic variation between Europeans , Africans and Asians . In six of these genes we detected , by means of the EHH test , variability patterns that are compatible with the hypothesis of local positive selection in Europeans ( Q04671 , P17643 and P21583 ) and in Asians ( Q04671 , P40126 , P21583 , P00533 and P14416 ) , whereas signals were scarce in Africans ( P40126 , P00533 and P14416 ) . Furthermore , a statistically significant correlation between genotypic variation in four pigmentation candidate genes and phenotypic variation of skin colour in 51 worldwide human populations was revealed . Overall , our data also suggest that light skin colour is the derived state and is of independent origin in Europeans and Asians , whereas dark skin color seems of unique origin , reflecting the ancestral state in humans .
