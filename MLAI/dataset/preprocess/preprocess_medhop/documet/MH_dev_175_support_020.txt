Immunophenotypic profile and role of adhesion molecules in splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow involvement . Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma ( SMZL ) , with or without villous lymphocytes ( VL+/- ) , is a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder with constant involvement of the bone marrow ( BM ) . Different BM infiltration patterns , mainly intra-sinusoidal , interstitial and nodular , have been described . Adhesion molecules ( AMs ) constitute a heterogeneous group of antigenic receptors playing a major role in leukocyte recruitment , in lymphocyte homing and in cellular-mediated immune response . Evolution and pattern of the BM infiltrate could be influenced by a variable expression of AM on SMZL lymphocytes . The degree and pattern of BM infiltration and the immunohistochemical expression of AM ( H- P62158 , P20273 , P14151 , Q14242 , P16581 , P05362 , P19320 and Beta-1 integrin ) among the different infiltration patterns were evaluated in BM biopsies of 38 patients with SMZL and graded according to a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0-4 and based on the percentage of positive cells . An intra-sinusoidal infiltration was constantly observed , alone or in conjunction with other patterns . H- P62158 and P20273 showed a moderate-to-high degree of positivity in the intra-sinusoidal infiltrate ( median expression grade-3 ) and were expressed in the neoplastic lymphocytes independently from the pattern . Q14242 was mostly expressed in the perisinusoidal region and in case of interstitial infiltration ( grade-2 ) . P05362 and P19320 were selectively expressed in the nodules as a reticular meshwork located in the core region ( grade-2 ) ; P19320 was also expressed in the perinodular endothelia . P16581 , P14151 and beta-1 integrin proved constantly negative . These data suggest that different expression of AM can influence the modality of BM infiltration in SMZL .
