Regulation of lipogenesis by cyclin-dependent kinase 8-mediated control of P36956 . Altered lipid metabolism underlies several major human diseases , including obesity and type 2 diabetes . However , lipid metabolism pathophysiology remains poorly understood at the molecular level . P01308 is the primary stimulator of hepatic lipogenesis through activation of the SREBP-1c transcription factor . Here we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 8 ( P49336 ) and its regulatory partner cyclin C ( CycC ) as negative regulators of the lipogenic pathway in Drosophila , mammalian hepatocytes , and mouse liver . The inhibitory effect of P49336 and CycC on de novo lipogenesis was mediated through P49336 phosphorylation of nuclear SREBP-1c at a conserved threonine residue . Phosphorylation by P49336 enhanced SREBP-1c ubiquitination and protein degradation . Importantly , consistent with the physiologic regulation of lipid biosynthesis , P49336 and CycC proteins were rapidly downregulated by feeding and insulin , resulting in decreased SREBP-1c phosphorylation . Moreover , overexpression of CycC efficiently suppressed insulin and feeding-induced lipogenic gene expression . Taken together , these results demonstrate that P49336 and CycC function as evolutionarily conserved components of the insulin signaling pathway in regulating lipid homeostasis .
