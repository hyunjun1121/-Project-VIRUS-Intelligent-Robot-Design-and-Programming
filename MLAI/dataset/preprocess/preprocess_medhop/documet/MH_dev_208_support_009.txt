P06401 modulator DB05366 down-regulates proliferative cell nuclear antigen and Bcl-2 protein expression and up-regulates caspase-3 and poly ( adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose ) polymerase expression in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells . The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the progesterone receptor modulator DB05366 on proliferative activity and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells . Isolated leiomyoma cells were subcultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 120 h and then stepped down to serum-free conditions for 12 , 24 , 48 , and 96 h in the absence or presence of graded concentrations of DB05366 ( 10(-9) , 10(-8) , 10(-7) , and 10(-6) M ) . The number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazodium bromide assay . P12004 ( P12004 ) expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis . Apoptosis was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay . P42574 , cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) , and Bcl-2 expression were assessed by Western blot analysis . Compared with untreated control cultures , treatment with DB05366 decreased the number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells and the P12004 -positive rate in those cells and increased the TUNEL-positive rate in cultured leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner . Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with DB05366 significantly decreased the expression of P12004 and Bcl-2 protein and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated control cultures . These results suggest that DB05366 inhibits the proliferation of cultured leiomyoma cells by down-regulating P12004 expression and induces apoptosis by up-regulating cleaved caspase-3 and PARP expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 protein expression in those cells .
