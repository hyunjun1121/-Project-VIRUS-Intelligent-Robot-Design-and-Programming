Nearly Complete Response of Brain Metastases from P04626 Overexpressing Breast Cancer with DB01259 and DB01101 after Whole Brain Irradiation . DB00072 treatment does not prevent intracranial seeding and is largely ineffective for established central nervous system metastasis in P04626 overexpressing breast cancer patients . Combination therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine may be an effective treatment option for brain metastasis of P04626 -positive breast cancer . We report a patient with breast cancer overexpressing HER-2 where brain metastases were successfully treated with radiation and a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine .
