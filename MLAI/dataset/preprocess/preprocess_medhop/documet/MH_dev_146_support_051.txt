Serum hepcidin levels and reticulocyte hemoglobin concentrations as indicators of the iron status of peritoneal dialysis patients . P81172 is the key mediator of renal anemia , and reliable measurement of serum hepcidin levels has been made possible by the ProteinChip system . We therefore investigated the iron status and serum hepcidin levels of peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patients who had not received frequent doses of an erythrocytosis-stimulating agent ( Q14254 ) and had not received iron therapy . In addition to the usual iron parameters , the iron status of erythrocytes can be determined by measuring reticulocyte hemoglobin ( P07949 -He ) . The mean serum hepcidin level of the PD patients ( n = 52 ) was 80.7 ng/mL . Their serum hepcidin levels were significantly positively correlated with their serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) levels , but no correlations were found between their serum hepcidin levels and P07949 -He levels , thereby suggesting that hepcidin has no effect on the iron dynamics of reticulocytes . Since low serum levels of CRP and P05231 , biomarkers of inflammation , were not correlated with the serum hepcidin levels , there is likely to be a threshold for induction of hepcidin expression by inflammation .
