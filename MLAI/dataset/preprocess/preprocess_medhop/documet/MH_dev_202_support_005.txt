The association of P29274 and P29275 polymorphisms with the risk and severity of chronic heart failure : a case-control study of a northern Chinese population . The causes of chronic heart failure ( CHF ) and its progression are likely to be due to complex genetic factors . DB00640 receptors A2A and A2B ( P29274 and P29275 , respectively ) play an important role in cardio-protection . Therefore , polymorphisms in the genes encoding those receptors may affect the risk and severity of CHF . This study was a case-control comparative investigation of 300 northern Chinese Han CHF patients and 400 ethnicity-matched healthy controls . Four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of P29274 ( rs2236625 , rs2236624 , rs4822489 , and rs5751876 ) and one SNP of P29275 ( rs7208480 ) were genotyped and an association between SNPs and clinical outcomes was evaluated . Odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were used to assess the association . The rs4822489 was significantly associated with the severity of CHF after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors ( p = 0.040 , OR = 1.912 , 95 % CI = 1.029-3.550 ) . However , the five SNPs as well as the haplotypes were not found to be associated with CHF susceptibility . The findings of this study suggest that rs4822489 may contribute to the severity of CHF in the northern Chinese . However , further studies performed in larger populations and aimed at better defining the role of this gene are required .
