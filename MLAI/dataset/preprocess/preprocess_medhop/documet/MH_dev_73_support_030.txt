Beneficial effects of cannabinoids ( CB ) in a murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation : role of P21554 /CB2 receptors . The endocannabinoid system ( ECS ) consists of two cannabinoid ( CB ) receptors , namely CB(1) and CB(2) receptor , and their endogenous ( endocannabinoids ) and exogenous ( cannabinoids , e.g. DB00470 ( THC ) ) ligands which bind to these receptors . Based on studies suggesting a role of THC and the ECS in inflammation , the objective of this study was to examine their involvement in type I hypersensitivity using a murine model of allergic airway inflammation . THC treatment of C57BL/6 wildtype mice dramatically reduced airway inflammation as determined by significantly reduced total cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) . These effects were greatest when mice were treated during both , the sensitization and the challenge phase . Furthermore , systemic immune responses were significantly suppressed in mice which received THC during sensitization phase . To investigate a role of CB(1/2) receptors in this setting , we used pharmacological blockade of CB(1) and/or CB(2) receptors by the selective antagonists and moreover CB(1)/CB(2) receptor double-knockout mice ( CB(1)(-/-)/CB(2)(-/-) ) and found neither significant changes in the cell patterns in BAL nor in immunoglobulin levels as compared to wildtype mice . Our results indicate that the activation of the ECS by applying the agonist THC is involved in the development of type I allergies . However , CB(1)/CB(2) receptor-independent signalling seems likely in the observed results .
