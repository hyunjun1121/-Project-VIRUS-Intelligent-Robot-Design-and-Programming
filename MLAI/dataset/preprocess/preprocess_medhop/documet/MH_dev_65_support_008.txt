A lactate-induced response to hypoxia . Organisms must be able to respond to low oxygen in a number of homeostatic and pathological contexts . Regulation of hypoxic responses via the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is well established , but evidence indicates that other , HIF-independent mechanisms are also involved . Here , we report a hypoxic response that depends on the accumulation of lactate , a metabolite whose production increases in hypoxic conditions . We find that the Q9UGV2 protein is degraded in a Q9GZT9 / P40337 -dependent manner in normoxia but is protected from destruction by binding to lactate that accumulates under hypoxia . The stabilized Q9UGV2 protein binds c-Raf to mediate hypoxia-induced activation of Raf- P29323 pathway , promoting angiogenesis and cell growth . Inhibiting cellular lactate production abolishes the Q9UGV2 -mediated hypoxia responses . Our study , therefore , elucidates the molecular basis for lactate-induced hypoxia signaling , which can be exploited for the development of therapies targeting hypoxia-induced diseases .
