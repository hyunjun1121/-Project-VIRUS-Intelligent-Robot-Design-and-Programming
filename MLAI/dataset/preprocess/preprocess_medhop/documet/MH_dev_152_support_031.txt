PARP and CHK inhibitors interact to cause DNA damage and cell death in mammary carcinoma cells . The present studies examined viability and DNA damage levels in mammary carcinoma cells following P09874 and O14757 inhibitor drug combination exposure . P09874 inhibitors [ AZD2281 ; ABT888 ; DB02690 ; AG014699 ] interacted with O14757 inhibitors [ P55089 -01 ; AZD7762 ; LY2603618 ] to kill mammary carcinoma cells . P09874 and O14757 inhibitors interacted to increase both single strand and double strand DNA breaks that correlated with increased Î³ P16104 phosphorylation . Treatment of cells with O14757 inhibitors increased the phosphorylation of O14757 and P27361 /2 . Knock down of Q13315 suppressed the drug-induced increases in O14757 and P27361 /2 phosphorylation and enhanced tumor cell killing by P09874 and O14757 inhibitors . Expression of dominant negative Q02750 enhanced drug-induced DNA damage whereas expression of activated Q02750 suppressed both the DNA damage response and tumor cell killing . Collectively our data demonstrate that P09874 and O14757 inhibitors interact to kill mammary carcinoma cells and that increased DNA damage is a surrogate marker for the response of cells to this drug combination .
