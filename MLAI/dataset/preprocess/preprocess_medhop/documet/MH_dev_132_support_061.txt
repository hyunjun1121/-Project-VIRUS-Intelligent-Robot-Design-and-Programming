Regulation of P01160 secretion from isolated atria by prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase-2 . Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) is a key enzyme regulating the production of various prostaglandins ( PGs ) from arachidonic acid . Angiotensin II has been reported to be an important inflammatory mediator , which increases P35354 . The aim of this study was to determine the role of various PGs and P35354 in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) secretion . PGF2alpha and PGD2 caused dose-dependent increases in P01160 release and intra-atrial pressure . The potency for the stimulation of P01160 secretion by PGF2alpha was higher than that by PGD2 . In contrast , DB00917 , DB01240 , PGJ2 , and thromboxane A2 did not show any significant effects . The increases in intra-atrial pressure and P01160 secretion induced by PGF2alpha and PGD2 were significantly attenuated by the pretreatment with an inhibitor of PGF2alpha receptor . By the pretreatment with an inhibitor for phospholipase C ( P98160 ) , inositol 3-phosphate ( IP3 ) receptor , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , or myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) , PGF2alpha-mediated increase in P01160 secretion and positive inotropy were attenuated . Inhibitor for P23219 or P35354 did not cause any significant effects on atrial parameters . In hypertrophied rat atria , PGF2alpha-induced positive inotropy and P01160 secretion were markedly attenuated whereas P35354 inhibitor stimulated P01160 secretion . The expression of P35354 increased and the expression of PGF2alpha receptor mRNA decreased in hypertrophied rat atria . These results suggest that PGF2alpha increased the P01160 secretion and positive inotropy through P98160 -IP3-PKC-MLCK pathway , and the modulation of P01160 secretion by P35354 inhibitor and PGF2alpha may partly relate to the development of renal hypertension .
