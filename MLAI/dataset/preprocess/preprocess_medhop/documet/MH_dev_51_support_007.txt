P35354 regulates the proliferation of glioma stem like cells . Cancer stem-like cells ( CSCs ) possessing features of neural precursor cells ( NPC ) influence initiation , recurrence and chemoresistance of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . As inflammation is crucial for glioblastoma progression we investigated the effect of chronic IL-1β treatment on CSCs derived from glioblastoma cell line U87MG . Exposure to IL-1β for 10 days increased ( i ) accumulation of 8-OHdG - a key biomarker of oxidative DNA damage ; ( ii ) DNA damage response ( DDR ) indicators γ P16104 , Q13315 and DNA-PK ; ( iii ) nuclear and cytoplasmic p53 and P35354 levels and ( iv ) interaction between P35354 and p53 . Despite upregulating p53 expression IL-1β had no effect on cell cycle progression , apoptosis or self renewal capacity of CSCs . P35354 inhibitor Celecoxib reduced self renewal capacity and increased apoptosis of both control and IL-1β treated CSCs . Therefore the ability of P35354 to regulate proliferation of CSCs irrespective of exposure to IL-1β , warrants further investigation of P35354 as a potential anti-glioma target .
