Preclinical safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) : mechanism of action of its cytotoxic component retained with improved tolerability . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is the first antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) approved for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . The therapeutic premise of ADCs is based on the hypothesis that targeted delivery of potent cytotoxic drugs to tumors will provide better tolerability and efficacy compared with non-targeted delivery , where poor tolerability can limit efficacious doses . Here , we present results from preclinical studies characterizing the toxicity profile of DB05773 , including limited assessment of unconjugated DM1 . DB05773 binds primate ErbB2 and human P04626 but not the rodent homolog c-neu . Therefore , antigen-dependent and non-antigen-dependent toxicity was evaluated in monkeys and rats , respectively , in both single- and repeat-dose studies ; toxicity of DM1 was assessed in rats only . DB05773 was well tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg ( ~4400 μg DM1/m(2) ) and 30 mg/kg ( ~ 6000 μg DM1/m(2) ) in rats and monkeys , respectively . In contrast , DM1 was only tolerated up to 0.2mg/kg ( 1600 μg DM1/m(2) ) . This suggests that at least two-fold higher doses of the cytotoxic agent are tolerated in DB05773 , supporting the premise of ADCs to improve the therapeutic index . In addition , DB05773 and DM1 safety profiles were similar and consistent with the mechanism of action of DM1 ( i.e. , microtubule disruption ) . Findings included hepatic , bone marrow/hematologic ( primarily platelet ) , lymphoid organ , and neuronal toxicities , and increased numbers of cells of epithelial and phagocytic origin in metaphase arrest . These adverse effects did not worsen with chronic dosing in monkeys and are consistent with those reported in DB05773 -treated patients to date .
