DB00072 emtansine in breast cancer . INTRODUCTION : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -targeted antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) composed of trastuzumab , a stable linker ( MCC ) , and the cytotoxic agent DM1 ( derivative of maytansine ) . Administration of DB05773 leads to limited systemic exposure of free DM1 , with no evidence of DM1 accumulation after repeated dosing . AREAS COVERED : Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel , and pertuzumab have shown substantial clinical activity and a favorable safety profile . A randomized , open-label , first-line trial comparing trastuzumab and docetaxel with single agent DB05773 showed a significant improved progression-free survival for DB05773 . EXPERT OPINION : DB05773 has successfully completed second-line Phase III development for advanced P04626 -positive breast cancer . The Phase III EMILIA study demonstrated an overall survival benefit for DB05773 compared to the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in taxane-trastuzumab pretreated patients . DB05773 may offer delivery on a personalized basis of very potent cytotoxic agents in a cellular selective manner .
