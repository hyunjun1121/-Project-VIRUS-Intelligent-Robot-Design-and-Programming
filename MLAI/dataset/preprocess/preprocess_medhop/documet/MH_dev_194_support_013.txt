Effect of N9-methylation and bridge atom variation on the activity of 5-substituted 2,4-diaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines against dihydrofolate reductases from Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii . The effect of N9-methylation and bridge atom variation on inhibitory potency and selectivity of 2,4-diaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines against dihydrofolate reductases ( P00374 ) was studied . Specifically three nonclassical 2,4-diamino-5-((N-methylanilino)methyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines with 2',5'-dimethoxyphenyl ( 2 ) , 3',4'-dichlorophenyl ( 3 ) , 1'-naphthyl ( 4 ) , one classical analogue with a 4'-L-glutamate substituent ( 10 ) , and four nonclassical 2,4-diamino-5-((phenylthio)methyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines with 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl ( 5 ) , 3',4'-dichlorophenyl ( 6 ) , 1'-naphthyl ( 7 ) , and 2'-naphthyl ( 8 ) substituents were synthesized . The classical and nonclassical analogues were obtained by displacement of the intermediate 2,4-diamino-5-bromomethylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine , 14 , with appropriately substituted N-methylaniline , thiophenols , or 4-(N-methylamino)benzoyl-L-glutamate . Compounds 2-8 and 10 were evaluated against Pneumocystis carinii ( pc ) , Toxoplasma gondii ( tg ) , and rat liver ( rl ) DHFRs . The N-methyl and thiomethyl analogues were more inhibitory than their corresponding anilinomethyl analogues ( previously reported ) against all three DHFRs . The inhibitory potency of these analogues was greater against rlDHFR than against tgDHFR which resulted in a loss of selectivity for tgDHFR compared to the N9-H analogues . The classical N9-methyl analogue 10 was more potent and about 2-fold more selective against tgDHFR than its corresponding desmethyl analogue . All of the analogues , 2-8 and 10 , were more selective than trimetrexate ( DB01157 ) against pcDHFR ( except 4 ) and significantly more selective than DB01157 against tgDHFR .
