Forced retinoic acid receptor alpha homodimers prime mice for APL-like leukemia . P10276 becomes an acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) oncogene by fusion with any of five translocation partners . Unlike RARalpha , the fusion proteins homodimerize , which may be central to oncogenic activation . This model was tested by replacing P29590 with dimerization domains from p50NFkappaB ( p50-RARalpha ) or the rapamycin-sensitive dimerizing peptide of P62942 ( P13726 -RARalpha ) . The X-RARalpha fusions recapitulated in vitro activities of P29590 -RARalpha . For P13726 -RARalpha , these properties were rapamycin sensitive . Although in vivo the artificial fusions alone are poor initiators of leukemia , p50-RARalpha readily cooperates with an activated mutant P32927 to induce APL-like disease . These results demonstrate that the dimerization interface of RARalpha fusion partners is a critical element in APL pathogenesis while pointing to other features of P29590 for enhancing penetrance and progression .
