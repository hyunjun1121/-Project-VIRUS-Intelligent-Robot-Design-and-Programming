Transgenic mice overexpressing cyclophilin A are resistant to cyclosporin A-induced nephrotoxicity via peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity . DB00091 ( DB00091 ) suppresses immune reaction by inhibiting calcineurin activity after forming complex with cyclophilins and is currently widely used as an immunosuppressive drug . P62937 ( CypA ) is the most abundantly and ubiquitously expressed family member of cyclophilins . We previously showed that DB00091 toxicity is mediated by ROS generation as well as by inhibition of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) activity of CypA in DB00091 -treated myoblasts [ FASEB J. 16 ( 2002 ) 1633 ] . Since DB00091 -induced nephrotoxicity is the most significant adverse effect in its clinical utilization , we here investigated the role of DB00091 inhibition of CypA PPIase activity in its nephrotoxicity using transgenic mouse models . Transgenic mice of either wild type ( CypA/wt ) or R55A PPIase mutant type ( CypA/R55A ) , a dominant negative mutant of CypA PPIase activity , showed normal growth without any apparent abnormalities . However , DB00091 -induced nephrotoxicity was virtually suppressed in CypA/wt mice , but exacerbated in CypA/R55A mice , compared to that of littermates . Also , life expectancy was extended in CypA/wt mice and shortened in CypA/R55A mice during DB00091 administration . Besides , DB00091 -induced nephrotoxicity was inversely related to the levels of catalase expression and activity . In conclusion , our data provide in vivo evidence that supplement of CypA PPIase activity allows animal 's resistance toward DB00091 -induced nephrotoxicity .
