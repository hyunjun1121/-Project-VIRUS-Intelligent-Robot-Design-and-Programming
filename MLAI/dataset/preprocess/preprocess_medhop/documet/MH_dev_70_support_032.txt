[ Research on hepatitis C virus entry inhibitor ] . Hepatitis c virus ( HCV ) infection has become one of the global public health problem,while there is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection , the so-called " cocktail " therapy that use a combination of drugs targeting multiple steps in the HCV infection cycle could achieve better curative effect. the process of HCV entering into host cell is the important step of drug intervention , in which HCV envelope protein El and E2 , Host cell factors including Heparan sulfate(HS) , P60033 , scavenger receptor class B type I ( Q8WTV0 ) , Q16625 ( OCLD ) , Claudin ( CLDN ) , low densitity lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) , dendritic cell-specific P32942 -grabbing nonintegrin ( Q9NNX6 ) , Liver/lymph node specific P32942 -grabbing integrin( Q9H2X3 ) , trans- ferrin receptor 1 ( P02786 ) and so on play a important role . The virus and the host factors can be used as targets of hcv entry inhibitors many studies have shown that as novel and promising compounds , HCV entry inhibitors combinating with other drugs can be more effective in the treatment of HCV , this paper have re- viewed targets and inhibitors of HCV enterring into host cell since 1990s .
