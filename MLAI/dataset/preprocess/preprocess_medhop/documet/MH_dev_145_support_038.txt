Direct and indirect striatal efferent pathways are differentially influenced by low and high dyskinetic drugs : behavioural and biochemical evidence . Clinical evidence suggests that stimulation of the D(1) rather than P14416 is related to the development of dyskinesias in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . We evaluated , in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of PD , sensitization of contralateral turning ( P09683 ) behaviour and abnormal involuntary movements ( AIMs ) as behavioural parameters of dyskinetic response , and changes in zif-268 mRNA expression in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons on subchronic administration of the D(2)/D(3) agonist ropinirole , defined as a mild dyskinetic drug in the clinic . Results were compared with previous findings on repeated L-dopa treatment . Ropinirole displayed a mild dyskinetic response characterized by P09683 only , which contrasted with the presence of P09683 in association with AIMs elicited by repeated L-dopa . Zif-268 mRNA levels were decreased in both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons by ropinirole , in contrast to hyper-expression of zif-268 mRNA selectively induced by L-dopa in striatonigral neurons . Unbalanced responsiveness of striatal efferent neurons might represent a molecular correlate of high dyskinetic potential and AIMs in rats ; in contrast , a balanced striatal output might underlie the low dyskinetic potential displayed by ropinirole .
