Feasibility of a microarray-based point-of-care P33261 genotyping test for predicting clopidogrel on-treatment platelet reactivity . DB00758 is a prodrug which is converted into active metabolite by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme , P33261 . Numerous polymorphisms of P33261 are reported , and a strong link exists between loss-of-function ( LOF ) or gain-of-function polymorphisms , clopidogrel metabolism , and clinical outcome . Hence , a fully automated point-of-care P33261 genotyping assay is more likely to bring personalized antiplatelet therapy into real practice . We assessed the feasibility of the Verigene 2C19/ P35520 Nucleic Acid Test , a fully automated microarray-based assay , compared to bidirectional sequencing , and performed VerifyNow Q9H244 assay to evaluate the effect of P33261 polymorphisms on on-treatment platelet reactivity in 57 Korean patients treated with clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention . The Verigene 2C19/ P35520 assay identified ∗2 , ∗3 , and ∗17 polymorphisms with 100 % concordance to bidirectional sequencing in 180 minutes with little hands-on time . Patients were classified into 4 groups : extensive ( ∗1/∗1 ; n = 12 , 21.1 % ) , intermediate ( ∗1/∗2 , ∗1/∗3 ; n = 33 , 57.9 % ) , poor ( ∗2/∗2 , ∗2/∗3 , and ∗3/∗3 ; n = 11 , 19.3 % ) , and ultrarapid metabolizers ( ∗1/∗17 ; n = 1 , 1.8 % ) . The prevalence of the CYP2C19 ∗2 , ∗3 , and ∗17 alleles was 36.0 % , 12.3 % , and 0.9 % . Platelet reactivity showed gene dose response according to the number of P33261 LOF allele . In conclusion , the Verigene 2C19/ P35520 assay gave accurate P33261 genotype results which were in well match with the differing on-treatment platelet reactivity .
