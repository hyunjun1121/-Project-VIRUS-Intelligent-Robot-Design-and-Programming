Estrogen receptors mediate rapid activation of phospholipase C pathway in the rat endometrium . The aim of the present study was to investigate the activation of rapid signaling events by 17β-estradiol in the rat uterus . 17β-Estradiol induced a rapid increase of total [ 3H ] -inositol phosphate accumulation in the whole uterus and endometrium , but not in the myometrium . The effect of 17β-estradiol in the endometrium was blocked by phospholipase C ( P98160 ) inhibitor ( U73122 ) , estrogen receptors antagonist ( DB00947 ) , exportin O14980 inhibitor ( leptomycin B ) and selective inhibitor of the P12931 family of protein tyrosine kinases ( Q99463 ) . Furthermore , a selective agonist of P03372 ( PPT ) and a selective agonist of Q99527 ( G-1 ) also induced a rapid increase of total [ (3)H ] -inositol phosphate accumulation in the endometrium . The G-1 effects were blocked by Q99527 antagonist ( G-15 ) . 17β-Estradiol and G-1 promoted an additive effect on total [ 3H ] -inositol phosphate accumulation . In conclusion , the present results indicate that a rapid activation of the P98160 -mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis occurred in the rat endometrium after 17β-estradiol stimulation , and this effect was mediated by P03372 that underwent nuclear export after hormone stimulation , and that Q99527 activation may play an additive role for this response . These rapid actions might be one of the key steps that mediate the estrogen-dependent activation of cellular events in the endometrium .
