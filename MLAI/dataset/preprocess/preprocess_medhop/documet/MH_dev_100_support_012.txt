Q92769 promotes P06730 sumoylation and activates mRNA translation gene specifically . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are best known as transcription corepressors through deacetylating histone tails . Here we show that Q92769 is also involved in cap-dependent mRNA translation by promoting sumoylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( P06730 ) , which is independent of its deacetylase activity . By stimulating P06730 sumoylation , Q92769 induces the formation of the active eukaryotic initiation factor 4F ( eIF4F ) complex and induces the protein synthesis of a subset of P06730 -responsive genes that are essential for cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis . These data demonstrate that Q92769 has an unexpected sumoylation-promoting activity and regulates cap-dependent mRNA translation .
