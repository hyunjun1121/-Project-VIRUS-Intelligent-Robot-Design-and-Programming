Carboxyl-terminal parathyroid hormone fragments : role in parathyroid hormone physiopathology . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Carboxyl-terminal parathyroid hormone ( C-PTH ) fragments constitute 80 % of circulating PTH . Since the first 34 amino acids of the PTH structure are sufficient to explain PTH classical biological effects on the type I PTH/ P12272 receptor and since C-PTH fragments do not bind to this receptor , they have long been considered inactive . Recent data suggest the existence of a C-PTH receptor through which C-PTH fragments exert biological effects opposite to those of human DB05829 on the type I PTH/ P12272 receptor . This is why a lot of attention has been paid to these fragments recently . RECENT FINDINGS : In vivo , synthetic C-PTH fragments are able to decrease calcium concentration , to antagonize the calcemic response to human PTH(1-34) and human DB05829 and to decrease the high bone turnover rate induced by human DB05829 . In vitro , they inhibit bone resorption , promote osteocyte apoptosis and exert a variety of effects on bone and cartilaginous cells . These effects are opposite to those of human DB05829 on the Q03431 . This suggests that the molecular forms of circulating PTH may control bone participation in calcium homeostasis via two different receptors . Clinically , the accumulation of C-PTH fragments in renal failure patients may cause PTH resistance and may be associated with adynamic bone disease . Rare parathyroid tumors , without a set point error , overproduce C-PTH fragments . The implication of C-PTH fragments in osteoporosis is still to be explored . SUMMARY : C-PTH fragments represent a new field of investigation in PTH biology . More studies are necessary to disclose their real importance in calcium and bone homeostasis in health and disease .
