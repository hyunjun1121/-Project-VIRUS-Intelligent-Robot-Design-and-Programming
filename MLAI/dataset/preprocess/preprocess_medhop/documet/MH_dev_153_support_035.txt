Two-dimensional liquid crystalline growth within a phase-field-crystal model . By using a two-dimensional phase-field-crystal ( P27918 ) model , the liquid crystalline growth of the plastic triangular phase is simulated with emphasis on crystal shape and topological defect formation . The equilibrium shape of a plastic triangular crystal ( PTC ) grown from an isotropic phase is compared with that grown from a columnar or smectic-A ( Q13216 ) phase . While the shape of a PTC nucleus in the isotropic phase is almost identical to that of the classical P27918 model , the shape of a PTC nucleus in Q13216 is affected by the orientation of stripes in the Q13216 phase , and irregular hexagonal , elliptical , octagonal , and rectangular shapes are obtained . Concerning the dynamics of the growth process , we analyze the topological structure of the nematic order , which starts from nucleation of +1/2 and -1/2 disclination pairs at the PTC growth front and evolves into hexagonal cells consisting of +1 vortices surrounded by six satellite -1/2 disclinations . It is found that the orientational and the positional order do not evolve simultaneously ; the orientational order evolves behind the positional order , leading to a large transition zone , which can span over several lattice spacings .
