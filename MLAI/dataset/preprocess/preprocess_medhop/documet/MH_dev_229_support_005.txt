P12004 -dependent kinase 5 is associated with risk for Alzheimer 's disease in a Dutch population-based study . Although the role of the Cdk5 protein in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is well recognized , there have been relatively few studies investigating genetic variants in the Q00535 gene in AD . In this study , we assessed the association between five previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the Q00535 gene and late onset AD by means of logistic regression and haplotype association analyses . Including all prevalent and incident AD cases , we found a significantly increased risk of AD for carriers of the GG genotype of SNP rs2069442 ( OR = 1.79 , 95 % CI 1.16-2.79 , p = 0.001 ) in those without P02649 *4 . When limiting the analysis to incident cases without P02649 *4 , carriers of the GG genotype showed a 1.9-fold increased risk of AD ( 95 % CI 1.16-3.10 , p = 0.003 ) . Variations in the Q00535 gene can be described in 5 haplotype blocks . In our analysis , the haplotype tagged by the G allele of SNP rs2069442 was significantly associated with AD ( p = 0.05 ) . In conclusion , our study suggests that Q00535 may be associated with AD .
