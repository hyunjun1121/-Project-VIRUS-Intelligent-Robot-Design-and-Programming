15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone suppress Janus kinase- P35610 inflammatory signaling through induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( O15524 ) and O14543 in glia . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma agonists are now emerging as therapeutic drugs for various inflammatory diseases . However , their molecular mechanism of action remains to be elucidated . Here we report a novel mechanism that underlies the P37231 agonist-mediated suppression of brain inflammation . We show that 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) and rosiglitazone reduce the phosphorylation of P42224 and P40763 as well as P23458 ( P23458 ) and O60674 in activated astrocytes and microglia . The P37231 agonist-mediated reduction in phosphorylation leads to the suppression of JAK- P35610 -dependent inflammatory responses . The effects of 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone are not mediated by activation of P37231 . 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone rapidly induce the transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling ( Q9NSE2 ) 1 and 3 , which in turn inhibit JAK activity in activated glial cells . In addition , Src homology 2 domain-containing protein phosphatase 2 ( SHP2 ) , another negative regulator of JAK activity , is also involved in their anti-inflammatory action . Our data suggest that 15d-PGJ(2) and rosiglitazone suppress the initiation of JAK- P35610 inflammatory signaling independently of P37231 , thus attenuating brain inflammation .
