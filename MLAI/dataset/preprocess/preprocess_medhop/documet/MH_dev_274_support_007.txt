Use of P01148 antagonists in reproductive medicine . Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) plays a key role in the secretion of gonadotrophins , follicle-stimulating hormone ( DB00094 ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , which regulate steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis . Two DB00644 antagonists , DB00050 and DB06785 , deprived of histaminergic side-effects , have been introduced into ovarian stimulation protocols to prevent premature LH surges and proved their safety in clinical trials . At present , most of the published studies have not found significant differences in follicular recruitment , oocyte quality , and so on , except for a decrease in pregnancy and implantation rates in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer ( IVF-ET ) cycles when the DB00644 antagonist rather than the agonist was used . This decrease in pregnancy rates was in relation with a necessary learning curve of the physicians . Another possibility is the impact of the DB00644 antagonist on endometrium through its P30968 ; this effect was cancelled after cryopreserved embryo transfers because the pregnancy rates were similar between DB00644 antagonist and agonist in this case . DB00644 antagonists were also interesting in poor responders and polycystic ovarian syndrome , where the agonists have not permitted to obtain the better results in IVF-ET cycles . Similarly , the DB00644 antagonists could prevent the LH surge in the intrauterine insemination cycles .
