Expression patterns of the implantation-associated genes in the uterus during the estrous cycle in mice . The mRNA expression patterns of P01133 , HB- P01133 , P15514 , P01133 receptor , DB01277 , P09603 , P01583 , P01584 , IL-1 receptor type 1 , IL-1 receptor antagonist , P15018 , P23219 , P35354 , P15941 , calcitonin , and rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue , all of which are involved in the process of conceptus implantation to the endometrium , were examined during the estrous cycle by means of real-time quantitative PCR . P35354 , HB- P01133 , P15018 , P15941 , P09603 , P01583 , P01584 , and IL-1 receptor antagonist were temporally regulated during the estrous cycle and highly expressed during the estrous stage . In the case of P23219 , P01133 , DB01277 , and P01133 receptor , the highest mRNA expression was during the diestrous stage . In contrast , the rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue mRNA expression did not change during the estrous cycle . These results indicate that rat Q6X4U4 mouse homologue expression at implantation might be specifically regulated by embryonic factors rather than the maternal environment .
