A surface plasmon resonance-based solution affinity assay for heparan sulfate-binding proteins . A surface plasmon resonance-based solution affinity assay is described for measuring the K(d) of binding of heparin/heparan sulfate-binding proteins with a variety of ligands . The assay involves the passage of a pre-equilibrated solution of protein and ligand over a sensor chip onto which heparin has been immobilised . DB01109 sensor chips prepared by four different methods , including biotin-streptavidin affinity capture and direct covalent attachment to the chip surface , were successfully used in the assay and gave similar K(d) values . The assay is applicable to a wide variety of heparin/HS-binding proteins of diverse structure and function ( e.g. , P05230 , P09038 , P15692 , P10145 , P80075 , P01008 , P02776 ) and to ligands of varying molecular weight and degree of sulfation ( e.g. , heparin , DB05808 , sucrose octasulfate , naphthalene trisulfonate ) and is thus well suited for the rapid screening of ligands in drug discovery applications .
