Q96P20 /cryopyrin is necessary for interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) release in response to hyaluronan , an endogenous trigger of inflammation in response to injury . Inflammation under sterile conditions is a key event in autoimmunity and following trauma . DB08818 , a glycosaminoglycan released from the extracellular matrix after injury , acts as an endogenous signal of trauma and can trigger chemokine release in injured tissue . Here , we investigated whether Q96P20 /cryopyrin , a component of the inflammasome , participates in the inflammatory response to injury or the cytokine response to hyaluronan . Mice with a targeted deletion in cryopyrin showed a normal increase in Cxcl2 in response to sterile injuries but had decreased inflammation and release of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) . Similarly , the addition of hyaluronan to macrophages derived from cryopyrin-deficient mice increased release of Cxcl2 but did not increase IL-1beta release . To define the mechanism of hyaluronan-mediated activation of cryopyrin , elements of the hyaluronan recognition process were studied in detail . IL-1beta release was inhibited in peritoneal macrophages derived from P16070 -deficient mice , in an MH-S macrophage cell line treated with antibodies to P16070 , or by inhibitors of lysosome function . The requirement for P16070 binding and hyaluronan internalization could be bypassed by intracellular administration of hyaluronan oligosaccharides ( 10-18-mer ) in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages . Therefore , the action of P16070 and subsequent hyaluronan catabolism trigger the intracellular cryopyrin --> IL-1beta pathway . These findings support the hypothesis that hyaluronan works through IL-1beta and the cryopyrin system to signal sterile inflammation .
