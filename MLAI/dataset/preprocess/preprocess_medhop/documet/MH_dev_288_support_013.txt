P50579 is required for P19526 initiation and proliferation . In a chemical screening , we tested the antiangiogenic effects of fumagillin derivatives and identified fumagillin as an inhibitor of definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos . DB02640 is known to target methionine aminopeptidase II ( MetAP2 ) , an enzyme whose function in hematopoiesis is unknown . We investigated the role of MetAP2 in hematopoiesis by using zebrafish embryo and human umbilical cord blood models . Zebrafish metap2 was expressed ubiquitously during early embryogenesis and later in the somitic region , the caudal hematopoietic tissue , and pronephric duct . metap2 was inhibited by morpholino and fumagillin treatment , resulting in increased mpo expression at 18 hours postfertilization and reduced c-myb expression along the ventral wall of dorsal aorta at 36 hours postfertilization . It also disrupted intersegmental vessels in Tg(fli1:gfp) embryos without affecting development of major axial vasculatures . Inhibition of MetAP2 in CB P28906 (+) cells by fumagillin had no effect on overall clonogenic activity but significantly reduced their engraftment into immunodeficient nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency mice . metap2 knock-down in zebrafish and inhibition by fumagillin in zebrafish and human CB P28906 (+) cells inhibited P62158 Kinase II activity and induced P29323 phosphorylation . This study demonstrated a hitherto-undescribed role of MetAP2 in definitive hematopoiesis and a possible link to noncanonical Wnt and P29323 signaling .
