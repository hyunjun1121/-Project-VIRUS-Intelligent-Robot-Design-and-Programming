DB00074 induction in patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimens . PURPOSE : The use of basiliximab induction increased significantly in recent years based on its superior efficacy and excellent safety profile demonstrated in studies with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression . However , its clinical utility in patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimens is still uncertain . METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed data of 366 low immunological risk recipients of deceased donor kidney transplants . Of them , 134 received basiliximab and tacrolimus ( TAC- P01589 ) , 100 received basiliximab and delayed tacrolimus(dTAC- P01589 ) , and 132 patients received tacrolimus without basiliximab(TAC-No) . The endpoints were the incidence of acute rejection , graft function , and patient and graft survivals at 1 year . RESULTS : The incidence of acute rejection was higher in dTAC- P01589 compared to TAC-IL-2RA and TAC-No Groups ( 33 vs.14.9 vs. 14.3 % , p < 0.001 ) . Inferior creatinine clearance was observed in dTAC- P01589 Group compared to TAC- P01589 and TAC-No Groups at months 1 ( 41.6 vs. 49.9 vs. 44.8 mL/min , p = 0.004 ) , 3 ( 49.8 vs. 57.2 vs. 53.5 mL/min , p = 0.017 ) , and 6 ( 53.1 vs. 61.8 vs. 57.0 mL/min , p = 0.001 ) . Patients who received basiliximab ( TAC- P01589 and dTAC- P01589 Groups ) had lower incidence of posttransplant diabetes ( 24 vs.18 vs. 39.3 % , p = 0.009 ) . Patient and graft survivals were similar among the groups . CONCLUSIONS : In low immunological risk kidney transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus , the use of basiliximab induction was not associated with lower rejection rates and did not allow delayed tacrolimus introduction .
