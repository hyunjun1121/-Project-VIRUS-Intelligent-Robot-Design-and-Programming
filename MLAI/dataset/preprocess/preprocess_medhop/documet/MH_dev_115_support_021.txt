δEF1 associates with P26358 and maintains DNA methylation of the P12830 promoter in breast cancer cells . Abnormal DNA methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine ( 5mC ) of CpG dinucleotides is a well-known epigenetic feature of cancer . Levels of P12830 , which is regularly expressed in epithelial tissues , are frequently reduced in epithelial tumors due to transcriptional repression , sometimes accompanied by hypermethylation of the promoter region . δEF1 family proteins ( δEF1/ P37275 and SIP1/ O60315 ) , key regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , suppress P12830 expression at the transcriptional level . We recently showed that levels of mRNAs encoding δEF1 proteins are regulated reciprocally with P12830 level in breast cancer cells . Here , we examined the mechanism underlying downregulation of P12830 expression in three basal-type breast cancer cells in which the P12830 promoter region is hypermethylated ( Hs578T ) or moderately methylated ( BT549 and MDA-MB-231 ) . Regardless of methylation status , treatment with DB01262 ( 5-aza ) , which inhibits DNA methyltransferases , had no effect on P12830 expression . Knockdown of δEF1 and SIP1 resulted in recovery of P12830 expression in cells lacking hypermethylation , whereas combined treatment with 5-aza synergistically restored P12830 expression , especially when the P12830 promoter was hypermethylated . Moreover , δEF1 interacted with DNA methyltransferase 1 ( P26358 ) through the Smad-binding domain . Sustained knockdown of δEF1 family proteins reduced the number of 5mC sites in the P12830 promoter region , suggesting that these proteins maintain 5mC through interaction with P26358 in breast cancer cells . Thus , δEF1 family proteins appear to repress expression of P12830 during cancer progression , both directly at the transcriptional level and indirectly at the epigenetic level .
