Association of cigarette smoking and CRP levels with DNA methylation in Î±-1 antitrypsin deficiency . Alpha-1 antitrypsin ( P01009 ) deficiency and tobacco smoking are confirmed risk factors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease . We hypothesized that variable DNA methylation would be associated with smoking and inflammation , as reflected by the level of C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) in P01009 -deficient subjects . Methylation levels of 1,411 autosomal CpG sites from the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I were analyzed in 316 subjects . Associations of five smoking behaviors and CRP levels with individual CpG sites and average methylation levels were assessed using non-parametric testing , linear regression and linear mixed effect models , with and without adjustment for age and gender . Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that methylation levels of 16 CpG sites significantly associated with ever-smoking status . A CpG site in the Q15582 gene was the only site associated with ever-smoking after adjustment for age and gender . No highly significant associations existed between age at smoking initiation , pack-years smoked , duration of smoking , and time since quitting smoking as predictors of individual CpG site methylation levels . However , ever-smoking and younger age at smoking initiation associated with lower methylation level averaged across all sites . DNA methylation at CpG sites in the Q13761 , P52333 and P04264 genes associated with CRP levels . The most significantly associated CpG sites with gender and age mapped to the P55212 and O00144 genes , respectively . In summary , this study identified multiple potential candidate CpG sites associated with ever-smoking and CRP level in P01009 -deficient subjects . Phenotypic variability in Mendelian diseases may be due to epigenetic factors .
