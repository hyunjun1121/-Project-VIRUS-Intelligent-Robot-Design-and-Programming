Tocotrienols activate the steroid and xenobiotic receptor , O75469 , and selectively regulate expression of its target genes . DB00163 is an essential nutrient with antioxidant activity . DB00163 is comprised of eight members , alpha- , beta- , gamma- , and delta-tocopherols and alpha- , beta- , gamma- , and delta-tocotrienols . All forms of vitamin E are initially metabolized by omega-oxidation , which is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes . The steroid and xenobiotic receptor ( O75469 ) is a nuclear receptor that regulates drug clearance in the liver and intestine via induction of genes involved in drug and xenobiotic metabolism . We show here that all four tocotrienols specifically bind to and activate O75469 , whereas tocopherols neither bind nor activate . Surprisingly , tocotrienols show tissue-specific induction of O75469 target genes , particularly P08684 . Tocotrienols up-regulate expression of P08684 but not P22309 ( P22309 ) or multidrug resistance protein-1 ( P08183 ) in primary hepatocytes . In contrast , tocotrienols induce P08183 and P22309 but not P08684 expression in intestinal LS180 cells . We found that nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) is expressed at relatively high levels in intestinal LS180 cells compared with primary hepatocytes . The unliganded O75469 interacts with NCoR , and this interaction is only partially disrupted by tocotrienols . Expression of a dominant-negative NCoR enhanced the ability of tocotrienols to induce P08684 in LS180 cells , suggesting that NCoR plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation by O75469 . Our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining how vitamin supplements affect the absorption and effectiveness of drugs . Knowledge of drug-nutrient interactions may help reduce the incidence of decreased drug efficacy .
