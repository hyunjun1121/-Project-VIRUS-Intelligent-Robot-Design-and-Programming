Neurokinin 1 receptor internalization in spinal cord slices induced by dorsal root stimulation is mediated by DB01221 receptors . The excitability of spinal neurons that transmit pain is modulated by glutamate and DB05875 ( SP ) . Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the dorsal horn , and its effects are enhanced by SP acting on neurokinin 1 receptors ( NK1Rs ) . We assessed activation of NK1Rs by studying their internalization in spinal cord slices . NK1Rs were localized in sections from the slices by using immunohistochemistry combined with fluorescence and confocal microscopy . Incubating the slices with SP induced internalization in most P25103 -positive neurons in laminae I , IIo , and X and in half of P25103 -positive neurons in laminae III-V . SP-induced internalization was abolished by the specific P25103 antagonist L-703,606 ( 1 microM ) . Stimulating the dorsal root with long-duration ( 0.4 msec ) pulses evoked EPSPs in dorsal horn neurons with latencies consistent with the conduction speed of A partial differential- and C-fibers . High-frequency ( 100 Hz ) stimulation of the dorsal root with these pulses induced P25103 internalization in neurons in laminae I-IIo of the stimulated side of the slice but not in the contralateral side or in other laminae . Stimulation at lower frequencies ( 1 and 10 Hz ) failed to elicit significant internalization , suggesting that the release of SP is frequency-dependent . Internalization produced by the 100 Hz tetanus was mimicked by DB01221 and blocked by an DB01221 antagonist , 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid , but not by the AMPA and kainate antagonist CNQX . The P25103 antagonist L-703,606 abolished the internalization produced by 100 Hz stimulation or DB01221 . Therefore , the release of SP in the dorsal horn appears to be controlled by DB01221 receptors .
