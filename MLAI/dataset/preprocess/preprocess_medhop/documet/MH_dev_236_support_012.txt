DB06589 inhibits the activation of P09619 β-expressing astrocytes in the brain metastatic microenvironment of breast cancer cells . Brain metastases occur in more than one-third of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress P04626 or are triple negative . Brain colonization of cancer cells occurs in a unique environment , containing microglia , oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and neurons . Although a neuroinflammatory response has been documented in brain metastasis , its contribution to cancer progression and therapy remains poorly understood . Using an experimental brain metastasis model , we characterized the brain metastatic microenvironment of brain tropic , P04626 -transfected MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells ( 231-BR- P04626 ) . A previously unidentified subpopulation of metastasis-associated astrocytes expressing phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor β ( at tyrosine 751 ; p751- P09619 β ) was identified around perivascular brain micrometastases . p751- P09619 β(+) astrocytes were also identified in human brain metastases from eight craniotomy specimens and in primary cultures of astrocyte-enriched glial cells . Previously , we reported that pazopanib , a multispecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , prevented the outgrowth of 231-BR- P04626 large brain metastases by 73 % . Here , we evaluated the effect of pazopanib on the brain neuroinflammatory microenvironment . DB06589 treatment resulted in 70 % ( P = 0.023 ) decrease of the p751- P09619 β(+) astrocyte population , at the lowest dose of 30 mg/kg , twice daily . Collectively , the data identify a subpopulation of activated astrocytes in the subclinical perivascular stage of brain metastases and show that they are inhibitable by pazopanib , suggesting its potential to prevent the development of brain micrometastases in breast cancer patients .
