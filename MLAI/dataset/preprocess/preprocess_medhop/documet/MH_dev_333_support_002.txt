Q14653 and Q92985 phosphorylation in virus-infected cells does not require double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R or Ikappa B kinase but is blocked by Vaccinia virus E3L protein . Induction of interferon-alpha ( IFNalpha ) gene expression in virus-infected cells requires phosphorylation-induced activation of the transcription factors Q14653 and Q92985 . However , the kinase(s) that targets these proteins has not been identified . Using a combined pharmacological and genetic approach , we found that none of the kinases tested was responsible for Q969Q1 phosphorylation in cells infected with Newcastle disease virus ( NDV ) . Although the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine potently blocked Q14653 and -7 phosphorylation , inhibitors for protein kinase C , protein kinase A , MEK , SAPK , IKK , and protein kinase R ( P19525 ) were without effect . Both O15111 and P19525 have been implicated in IFN induction , but cells genetically deficient in O15111 , P19525 , or the P19525 -related genes Q9NZJ5 , O75460 , or Q9P2K8 retained the ability to phosphorylate Q92985 and induce IFNalpha . Interestingly , P19525 mutant cells were defective for response to double-stranded ( ds ) RNA but not to virus infection , suggesting that dsRNA is not the only activating viral component . Consistent with this notion , protein synthesis was required for Q92985 phosphorylation in virus-infected cells , and the kinetics of phosphorylation and viral protein production were similar . Despite evidence for a lack of involvement of dsRNA and P19525 , vaccinia virus E3L protein , a dsRNA-binding protein capable of inhibiting P19525 , was an effective Q14653 and -7 phosphorylation inhibitor . These results suggest that a novel cellular protein that is activated by viral products in addition to dsRNA and is sensitive to E3L inhibition is responsible for Q969Q1 activation and reveal a novel mechanism for the anti-IFN effect of E3L distinct from its inhibition of P19525 .
