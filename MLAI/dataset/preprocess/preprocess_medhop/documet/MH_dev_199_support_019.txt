P12956 and ku80 null mutants improve the gene targeting frequency in Monascus ruber M7 . Normally , gene targeting by homologous recombination occurs rarely during a transformation process since non-homologous recombination is predominant in filamentous fungi . In our previous researches , the average gene replacement frequency ( P01286 ) in Monascus ruber M7 was as low as 15 % . To develop a highly efficient gene targeting system for M. ruber M7 , two M. ruber M7 null mutants of ku70 ( MrΔku70 ) and ku80 ( MrΔku80 ) were constructed which had no apparent defects in the development including vegetative growth , colony phenotype , microscopic morphology and spore yield compared with M. ruber M7 . In addition , the production of some significant secondary metabolites such as pigments and citrinin had no differences between the two disruptants and the wild-type strain . Further results revealed that the GRFs of triA ( encoding a putative acetyltransferase ) were 42.2 % and 61.5 % in the MrΔku70 and MrΔku80 strains , respectively , while it was only about 20 % in M. ruber M7 . Furthermore , GRFs of these two disruptants at other loci ( the pigE , fmdS genes in MrΔku70 and the ku70 gene in MrΔku80 ) were investigated , and the results indicated that GRFs in the MrΔku70 strain and the MrΔku80 strain were doubled and tripled compared with that in M. ruber M7 , respectively . Therefore , the ku70 and ku80 null mutants of M. ruber M7 , especially the ku80-deleted strain , will be excellent hosts for efficient gene targeting .
