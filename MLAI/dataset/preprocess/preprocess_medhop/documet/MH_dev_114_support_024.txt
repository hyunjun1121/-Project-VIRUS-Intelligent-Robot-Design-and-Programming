P09917 deficiency reduces acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and lethality . 5-Lipoxygenase ( P09917 ) converts arachidonic acid into leukotrienes ( LTs ) and is involved in inflammation . At present , the participation of P09917 in acetaminophen ( DB00316 ) -induced hepatotoxicity and liver damage has not been addressed . P09917 deficient ( 5-LO⁻/⁻ ) mice and background wild type mice were challenged with DB00316 ( 0.3-6 g/kg ) or saline . The lethality , liver damage , neutrophil and macrophage recruitment , LTB₄ , cytokine production , and oxidative stress were assessed . DB00316 induced a dose-dependent mortality , and the dose of 3 g/kg was selected for next experiments . DB00316 induced LTB4 production in the liver , the primary target organ in DB00316 toxicity . Histopathological analysis revealed that 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice presented reduced DB00316 -induced liver necrosis and inflammation compared with WT mice . DB00316 -induced lethality , increase of plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase , liver cytokine ( IL-1β , P01375 -α , IFN- γ , and P22301 ) , superoxide anion , and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances production , myeloperoxidase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity , Nrf2 and gp91(phox) mRNA expression , and decrease of reduced glutathione and antioxidant capacity measured by 2,2'-azinobis ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate ) assay were prevented in 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice compared to WT mice . Therefore , P09917 deficiency resulted in reduced mortality due to reduced liver inflammatory and oxidative damage , suggesting P09917 is a promising target to reduce DB00316 -induced lethality and liver inflammatory/oxidative damage .
