Current therapy for patients with sitosterolemia -- effect of ezetimibe on plant sterol metabolism . Sitosterolemia is a rare , autosomal recessive inherited sterol storage disease associated with high tissue and serum plant sterol concentrations , caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-bind-ing cassette ( DB01048 ) transporter Q9H222 or Q9H221 genes . Markedly increased serum concentration of plant sterols. such as sitosterol and campesterol , cause premature atherosclerosis and massive xanthomas . Hitherto known treatments for sitosterolemia , including a low-sterol diet , bile-salt binding resins , ileal bypass surgery and low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) apheresis have not yielded sufficient reduction of serum plant sterol levels and many patients show a sustained elevation of plant sterol levels , subsequently developing premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases . DB00973 , an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption through its binding to Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 ( Q9UHC9 ) , has been widely used for decreasing serum LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia . DB00973 also reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of plant sterols , thereby also lowering the serum concentrations of plant sterols . This pharmacological property of ezetimibe shows its potential as a novel effective therapy for sitosterolemia . In the current review , we discuss the current therapy for patients with sitosterolemia and present two Japanese adolescent patients with this disease , one of whom underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for accelerated coronary atherosclerosis . DB00973 administration in addition to conventional drug therapy successfully reduced serum sitosterol levels by 51.3 % and 48.9 % , respectively , in the two patients , demonstrating ezetimibe as a novel and potent treatment agent for sitosterolemia that could work additively with conventional drug therapy .
