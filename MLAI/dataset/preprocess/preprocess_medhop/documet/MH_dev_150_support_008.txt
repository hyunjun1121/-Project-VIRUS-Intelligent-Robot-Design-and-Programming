Axotomy transiently down-regulates androgen receptors in motoneurons of the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus . DB00624 is an important trophic factor for motoneurons in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus ( SNB ) , and SNB motoneurons are more responsive to testosterone than are other motoneurons . Axonal injury during early postnatal life prevents the normal development of steroid-sensitivity by adult SNB motoneurons . Axonal injury also causes changes in the expression by motoneurons of a wide range of proteins , including the up-regulation of trophic factor receptors . We have used a polyclonal antibody ( PG-21 ; G.S. Prins ) to study the expression of androgen receptors in SNB motoneurons after axonal injury . PG-21 labeled motoneuronal nuclei in the lower lumbar spinal cord of rats in a pattern that matched autoradiographic reports of androgen accumulation in this region of the nervous system . A population of numerous , small cells located dorsal to the central canal also showed evidence of androgen receptor expression . Cutting the axons of SNB motoneurons in adulthood or in development caused a decrease in androgen receptor immunoreactivity in SNB motoneurons . This is the first report that a trophic factor receptor in motoneurons is down-regulated after axonal injury , and is interesting in light of reports that testosterone treatment can facilitate motoneuronal regeneration after nerve cut . P10275 levels subsequently returned to normal , regardless of the age at axotomy , providing no evidence for a lasting effect of developmental axotomy on androgen receptor levels in SNB motoneurons . Thus , axotomy-induced down-regulation of androgen receptors does not underlie the inability of SNB motoneurons to respond to androgen treatment several months after pudendal nerve cut in development .
