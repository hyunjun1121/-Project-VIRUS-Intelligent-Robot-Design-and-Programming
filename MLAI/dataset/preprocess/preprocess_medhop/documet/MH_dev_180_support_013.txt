Mechanism of interaction of niflumic acid with heterologously expressed kidney CLC-K chloride channels . CLC-K Cl(-) channels belong to the CLC protein family . In kidney and inner ear , they are involved in transepithelial salt transport . Mutations in ClC-Kb lead to Bartter 's syndrome , and mutations in the associated subunit barttin produce Bartter 's syndrome and deafness . We have previously found that 3-phenyl-CPP blocks hClC-Ka and rClC- P04264 from the extracellular side in the pore entrance . Recently , we have shown that niflumic acid ( DB04552 ) , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory fenamate , produces biphasic behavior on human CLC-K channels that suggests the presence of two functionally different binding sites : an activating site and a blocking site . Here , we investigate in more detail the interaction of DB04552 on CLC-K channels . Mutants that altered block by 3-phenyl-2-(p-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid ( CPP ) had no effect on DB04552 block , indicating that the inhibition binding site of DB04552 is different from that of 3-phenyl-CPP and flufenamic acid . Moreover , DB04552 does not compete with extracellular Cl(-) ions , suggesting that the binding sites of DB04552 are not located deep in the pore . Differently from ClC-Ka , on the rat homologue P51800 , DB04552 has only an inhibitory effect . We developed a quantitative model to describe the complex action of DB04552 on ClC-Ka . The model predicts that ClC-Ka possesses two DB04552 binding sites : when only one site is occupied , DB04552 increases ClC-Ka currents , whereas the occupation of both binding sites leads to channel block .
