DB00227 enhances gefitinib activity in glioblastoma cells irrespective of EGFRvIII and P60484 status . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is commonly amplified and mutated in glioblastoma , making it a compelling therapeutic target . Recent reports have demonstrated clinical activity of the P00533 inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in a subset of glioblastoma patients . Co-expression of EGFRvIII , a constitutively active mutant receptor expressed in 50 % of tumours , and P60484 , an inhibitor of PI3K activity , by glioblastoma cells is associated with clinical response to these P00533 kinase inhibitors . P60484 loss and resulting increased PI3K pathway activity appears to act as a resistance factor . A critical therapeutic challenge is to identify agents that enhance the anti-cancer effects of these agents and promote responsiveness to P00533 kinase inhibitors in a broader spectrum of glioblastoma patients . For example , combining gefitinib with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway show enhanced cytotoxicity in glioblastoma derived cell lines . Here , we show that targeting P04035 with lovastatin , that can affect the activity of multiple cell signaling pathways , significantly enhanced the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to the P00533 kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the five cell lines tested . In an isogenic model system , U87MG glioblastoma cells expressing EGFRvIII and P60484 in relevant combinations , we show that combined gefitinib and lovastatin treatments induce potent synergistic cytotoxicity irrespective of EGFRvIII and P60484 status . These studies demonstrate the potential of lovastatin to augment the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib and provide a rationale for combined statin/ P00533 targeted therapies in glioblastoma patients .
