Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition attenuates platelet-activating factor-induced platelet activation by reducing protein kinase C activity . Glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa inhibition may abolish activated leukocyte-induced platelet activation , in which leukocyte-released platelet-activating factor ( Q15004 ) is a major mediator . The present study thus investigated if and how P08514 /IIIa inhibitors interfere with Q15004 -induced platelet activation . Platelet and leukocyte activation were monitored by flow cytometry and immunoblotting . P08514 /IIIa inhibitors ( c7E3 , non-peptide SR121566 , and MAb RFGP56 ) attenuated Q15004 -induced , but not adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) - or thrombin receptor activating peptide ( TRAP ) -induced platelet P16109 expression in whole blood . P08514 /IIIa blockade enhanced ADP- or TRAP-induced leukocyte CD11b expression , but not the response to Q15004 . P08514 /IIIa blockade attenuated Q15004 -induced , but enhanced ADP- or TRAP-induced platelet-leukocyte aggregation . Under the present experimental conditions , thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism did not significantly influence Q15004 -induced platelet activation , and P08514 /IIIa inhibition did not interfere with calcium mobilization/influx in platelets . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) blockade inhibited Q15004 -induced platelet P16109 expression , and Q15004 -induced PKC activity was reduced by P08514 /IIIa inhibition . Q15004 ( =1 micro m ) did not induce Q02750 /2 or P29323 1/2 phosphorylation , whilst thrombin induced marked responses , which were enhanced by P08514 /IIIa blockade . Thus , P08514 /IIIa inhibition attenuates Q15004 -induced platelet activation via inhibiting PKC activity . P08514 /IIIa blockade enhances thrombin-induced platelet Q02750 /2 and P29323 1/2 activation , and augments ADP- and TRAP-induced leukocyte activation by enhancing platelet-leukocyte aggregation .
