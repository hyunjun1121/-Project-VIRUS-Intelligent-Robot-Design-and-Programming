Kinetic studies of the pharmacologic response to captopril in rats . I . Role of the renin-angiotensin system . Pressor response to exogenous angiotensins was investigated in rats . Two-kidney Goldblatt hypertensive rats ( P10912 ) and sodium-deficient normotensive rats ( SDR ) , as well as normal rats , ( NR ) were used . Various amounts of angiotensin I ( Ang I ) or angiotensin ( Ang II ) were administered intravenously by constant infusion , with or without pretreatment with angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , and the pressor response was determined . DB01197 was used as the P12821 inhibitor . From the data obtained , a simple kinetic model for the renin-angiotensin system was constructed . The model was based on a linear compartment model with the following assumptions ; ( a ) there are compartments in respect to Ang I and II in the body ; ( b ) in the steady-state condition , Ang I is produced at a constant rate ; ( c ) a part of Ang I is converted to Ang II by a first-order rate process ; ( d ) Ang I and II are eliminated from the respective compartments by first-order rate processes and ( e ) the relationship between mean arterial blood pressure and the amount of Ang II in the body can be described by Hill 's equation with a baseline effect . Then the pressor response to angiotensins in P10912 , SDR or NR was fitted to the model . The result indicated that the pressor response to Ang I or Ang II can be described by the present model . The model parameters obtained were consistent with the actual physiological parameters of rats .
