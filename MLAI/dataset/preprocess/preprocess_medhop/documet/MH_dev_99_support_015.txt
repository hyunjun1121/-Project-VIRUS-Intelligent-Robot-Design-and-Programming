Cytotoxic effects of bortezomib in myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia depend on autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation of Q9Y4K3 and repression of P25786 . DB00188 ( Velcade ) is used widely for the treatment of various human cancers ; however , its mechanisms of action are not fully understood , particularly in myeloid malignancies . DB00188 is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome . Paradoxically , we find that bortezomib induces proteasome-independent degradation of the Q9Y4K3 protein , but not mRNA , in myelodysplastic syndrome ( P43034 ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell lines and primary cells . The reduction in Q9Y4K3 protein coincides with bortezomib-induced autophagy , and subsequently with apoptosis in P43034 /AML cells . RNAi-mediated knockdown of Q9Y4K3 sensitized bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines , underscoring the importance of Q9Y4K3 in bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity . DB00188 -resistant cells expressing an shRNA targeting Q9Y4K3 were resensitized to the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib due to down-regulation of the proteasomal subunit Î±-1 ( P25786 ) . To determine the molecular consequences of loss of Q9Y4K3 in P43034 /AML cells , in the present study , we applied gene-expression profiling and identified an apoptosis gene signature . Knockdown of Q9Y4K3 in P43034 /AML cell lines or patient samples resulted in rapid apoptosis and impaired malignant hematopoietic stem/progenitor function . In summary , we describe herein novel mechanisms by which Q9Y4K3 is regulated through bortezomib/autophagy-mediated degradation and by which it alters P43034 /AML sensitivity to bortezomib by controlling P25786 expression .
