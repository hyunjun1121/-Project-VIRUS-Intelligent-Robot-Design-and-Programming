Molecular weight and biochemical profile of a chemically modified heparin derivative , Suleparoide . Recently , a new chemically modified derivative of heparin ( Suleparoide , Syntex Laboratories Buenos Aires , Argentina ) was introduced for the prophylaxis of thrombosis and treatment of vascular disorders . This agent is claimed to contain a depolymerized , chemically modified , heparin derivative with similar biologic actions as heparan sulfate . To study the pharmacologic profile of this agent , we have defined its molecular weight distribution profile , utilizing a computerized gel permeation chromatographic system equipped with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors . Suleparoide exhibited a normal molecular distribution profile with no contaminants . It exhibited a weight average of 9.3 K DA and an apparent peak MW of 8.0 K DA . Approximately 50 % of the molecular components were < 5.0 K DA and 40 % > 5.0 K DA . The results from these studies on the mechanisms show that Suleparoide has anticoagulant activity primarily mediated through DB01109 Cofactor-II ( P05546 ) and because of its novel mechanism of action , further investigations on the biochemical profile of Suleparoide are carried out . Global clotting tests such as Activated Partial P13726 Time ( APTT ) , Heptest and Thrombin Time ( TT ) revealed a concentration dependent effect in all assays . Plasma samples supplemented with Suleparoide exhibited no significant anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities . However , in the P05546 mediated inhibitory assay for IIa , Suleparoide exhibited significant activity . In contrast , the P01008 ( DB11598 ) mediated inhibition of IIa was much weaker .
