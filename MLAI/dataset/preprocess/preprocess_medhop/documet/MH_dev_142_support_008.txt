Radiolabeled ligand binding to the catalytic or allosteric sites of O76074 and PDE11 . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) have been investigated for years as targets for therapeutic intervention in a number of pathophysiological processes . Phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) , which is highly specific for guanosine 3'-5'-cyclic-monophosphate ( cGMP ) at both its catalytic site and its allosteric sites , has generated particular interest because it is potently and specifically inhibited by three drugs : sildenafil ( Viagra , Pfizer ) , tadalafil ( DB00820 , Lilly- Q9Y6W8 ) , and vardenafil ( DB00862 , Bayer GSK ) . Previously , we have used [(3)H]cGMP to directly study the interaction of cGMP with the allosteric sites of O76074 , but because cGMP binds with relatively low affinity to the catalytic site , it has been difficult to devise a binding assay for this particular binding reaction . This approach using measurement of radiolabeled ligand binding continues to allow us to more precisely define functional features of the enzyme . We now use a similar approach to study the characteristics of high-affinity [(3)H]inhibitor binding to the O76074 catalytic domain . For these studies , we have prepared [(3)H]sildenafil and [(3)H]tadalafil , two structurally different competitive inhibitors of O76074 . The results demonstrate that radiolabeled ligands can be used as probes for both catalytic site and allosteric site functions of O76074 . We describe herein the methods that we have established for studying the binding of radiolabeled ligands to both types of sites on O76074 . These techniques have also been successfully applied to the study of binding of radiolabeled O76074 inhibitors to PDE11 , suggesting that these methods are applicable to the study of other PDEs , and perhaps other enzyme families .
