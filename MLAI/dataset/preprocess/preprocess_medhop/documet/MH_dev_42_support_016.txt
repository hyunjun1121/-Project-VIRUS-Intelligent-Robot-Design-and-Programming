Dopamine modulating drugs influence striatal (+)-[11C]DTBZ binding in rats : Q05940 binding is sensitive to changes in vesicular dopamine concentration . Binding of (+)-[11C]DTBZ ( dihydrotetrabenazine ) to the striatal vesicular monoamine transporter ( Q05940 ) is widely considered to be a stable marker of dopamine neurone integrity . However , we now find that specific binding of a tracer dose of (+)-[11C]DTBZ is modestly increased in rat striatum following dopamine depletion with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine ( alpha-MPT , +14 % ) or DB01576 ( d- P49418 , 20 mg/kg , +12 % ) and decreased following dopamine elevation with gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( DB01440 , -16 % ) or levodopa ( -20 % ) . We suggest that in vivo (+)-[11C]DTBZ binding in imaging studies is subject to competition by vesicular dopamine and , in this respect , is not a " stable " dopamine biomarker as is generally assumed .
