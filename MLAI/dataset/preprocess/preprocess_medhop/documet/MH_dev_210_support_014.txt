DB09045 : the newest P43220 agonist for the management of type 2 diabetes . OBJECTIVE : To review the pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , safety , and efficacy of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( P0C6A0 RA ) , dulaglutide , in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) . DATA SOURCES : A PubMed search was completed to identify publications from 1947 to October 2014 using the search terms dulaglutide and LY2189265 . References were reviewed to identify additional resources . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION : Articles were included if they evaluated the pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , safety , or efficacy of dulaglutide . DATA SYNTHESIS : DB09045 reduces both glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) and weight by stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon in a glucose-dependent manner , delaying gastric emptying , and promoting satiety . DB09045 consists of 2 P0C6A0 analogues that have been modified to make it a long-acting , once-weekly agent . DB09045 has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , glimepiride , pioglitazone , and insulin lispro . It has demonstrated superior A1C reduction compared with placebo , metformin , insulin glargine , sitagliptin , and twice-daily exenatide . It demonstrated noninferiority in A1C reduction to liraglutide . DB09045 changed A1C by -0.78 % to -1.51 % , and it changed weight by -0.35 kg to -3.03 kg . The most common adverse effects in clinical studies were nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea . CONCLUSIONS : DB09045 is the fifth P0C6A0 RA approved for T2D in the United States . It is an attractive option because it is dosed once-weekly , provides A1C lowering similar to liraglutide , weight reduction similar to exenatide , and has an adverse effect profile similar to exenatide and liraglutide .
