DB00877 antagonizes P01375 induction of P19320 on endothelial cells by inhibiting mTORC2 . Recruitment of circulating leukocytes into inflamed tissues depends on adhesion molecules expressed by endothelial cells ( ECs ) . Here we report that rapamycin pretreatment reduced the ability of P01375 -treated ECs to capture T cells under conditions of venular flow . This functional change was caused by inhibition of P01375 -induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) and could be mimicked by knockdown of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) or rictor , but not raptor , implicating mTORC2 as the target of rapamycin for this effect . Mechanistically , mTORC2 acts through Akt to repress Raf1- Q02750 /2- P27361 /2 signaling , and inhibition of mTORC2 consequently results in hyperactivation of P27361 /2 . Increased P27361 /2 activity antagonizes P19320 expression by repressing P01375 induction of the transcription factor P10914 . Preventing activation of P27361 /2 reduced the ability of rapamycin to inhibit P01375 -induced P19320 expression . In vivo , rapamycin inhibited mTORC2 activity and potentiated activation of P27361 /2 . These changes correlated with reduced endothelial expression of P01375 -induced P19320 , which was restored via pharmacological inhibition of P27361 /2 . Functionally , rapamycin reduced infiltration of leukocytes into renal glomeruli , an effect which was partially reversed by inhibition of P27361 /2 . These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which rapamycin modulates the ability of vascular endothelium to mediate inflammation and identifies endothelial mTORC2 as a potential therapeutic target .
