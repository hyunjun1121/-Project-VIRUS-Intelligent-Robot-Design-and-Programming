The effect of acquired cisplatin resistance on sensitivity to P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in P00533 mutant lung cancer cells . Although epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( P00533 TKIs ) are used as first-line agents for treating nonsquamous cell lung cancer with P00533 mutation , there are many patients who have to receive these drugs following platinum-based chemotherapy . This study was designed to define whether exposure to cisplatin could affect the sensitivity to P00533 TKIs because conflicting results have been presented . We established sublines that are resistant to cisplatin from P00533 wild-type cells ( A549 and H460 ) and P00533 mutant cells ( PC-9 and HCC827 ) . The P00533 -related signals were examined by Western blotting . MTT assay and the trypan blue exclusion method were used for the in vitro study , while tumor size and the SUV of the 18FDG-PET scans were measured in animal models . The IC50 value and apoptotic fractions after exposure to P00533 TKIs , such as gefitinib , erlotinib , and DB08916 , were almost the same in the cisplatin-resistant sublines compared to that of the parent cells . Although the baseline P60484 expression was reduced in the resistant cells , as was indicated in a previous study , the P00533 -related signals similarly responded to the P00533 TKIs . Furthermore , the reduced tumor size and SUV of the 18FDG-PET of the implanted tumor in nude mice according to erlotinib treatment were not different between the resistant sublines and the parent cells . In conclusion , the acquired resistance to cisplatin did not affect the sensitivity to P00533 TKIs in the P00533 mutant lung cancer cells , and this should abrogate any concerns about the use of P00533 TKIs following platinum-based chemotherapy .
