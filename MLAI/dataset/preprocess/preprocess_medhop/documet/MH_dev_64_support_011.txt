Phase II , open-label trial to assess QTcF effects , pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of afatinib in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors . PURPOSE : DB08916 is an irreversible ErbB family blocker currently under evaluation in late-stage clinical trials . This study primarily assessed the cardiac safety , pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of afatinib in cancer patients . METHODS : In this multicenter , Phase II , open-label , single-arm trial , 60 patients with solid tumors who were expected to express epidermal growth factor receptor-1 and P04626 received oral afatinib 50 mg daily . QTcF intervals ( QT interval corrected by the Fridericia formula ) were evaluated based on electrocardiogram recordings time-matched with pharmacokinetic blood samples after single ( Day 1 ) and continuous ( Day 14 ; steady state ) administration . Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) , version 3.0 ; antitumor activity was assessed using RECIST 1.0 . RESULTS : There was a nonsignificant decrease of 0.3 ms ( 90 % confidence interval -2.8 , 2.3 ; N = 49 ) in the mean of the average time-matched QTcF interval from baseline to steady state . The maximum plasma concentration for afatinib was seen at median tmax 3 h after both single dose and at steady state . No relationship between afatinib plasma concentrations and time-matched QTcF , QT and heart rate change was found . The overall adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of afatinib . One patient demonstrated a partial response ( PR ) and two patients unconfirmed PRs . CONCLUSIONS : DB08916 had no impact on cardiac repolarization , had a manageable safety profile and demonstrated antitumor activity in this uncontrolled study .
