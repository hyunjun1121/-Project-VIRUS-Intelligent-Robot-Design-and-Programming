Evaluation of DNA damage in P48444 patients and its correlation with polymorphisms in repair genes . BACKGROUND : We investigated a potential link between genetic polymorphisms in genes P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) , O15527 ( Ser326Cys ) , O43542 ( Thr241Met ) , and Q13426 ( Ile401Thr ) with the level of DNA damage and repair , accessed by comet and micronucleus test , in 51 P48444 patients and 51 controls . METHODS : Peripheral blood was used to perform the alkaline and neutral comet assay ; and genetic polymorphisms by PCR/RFLP . To assess the susceptibility to exogenous DNA damage , the cells were treated with methyl methanesulphonate for 1-h or 3-h . After 3-h treatment the % residual damage was calculated assuming the value of 1-h treatment as 100 % . The cytogenetic damage was evaluated by buccal micronucleus cytome assay ( BMCyt ) . RESULTS : P48444 patients with the risk allele P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) and O43542 ( Thr241Met ) showed higher DNA damage by comet assay . The residual damage was higher for P48444 with risk allele in the four genes . In P48444 patients was showed negative correlation between BMCyt ( binucleated , nuclear bud , condensed chromatin and karyorrhexic cells ) with pulmonary function and some variant genotypes . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest a possible association between variant genotypes in P18887 ( Arg399Gln ) , O15527 ( Ser326Cys ) , O43542 ( Thr241Met ) , and Q13426 ( Ile401Thr ) , DNA damage and progression of P48444 .
