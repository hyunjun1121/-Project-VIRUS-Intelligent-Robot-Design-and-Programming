[ DB00988 -beta-hydroxylaseaktivit√§t im Plasma von Dialysepatienten ( author 's transl ) ] . Plasma dopamin-b-hydroxylase ( P09172 ) was studied in 70 healthy control persons and in 37 hemodialysed patients . Basal P09172 in controls corresponded to 50.0 +/- 29.3 IU . There was was no significant difference between males ( 53.9 +/1 33.8 IU ) and females ( 47.4 +/- 25 IU ) ; no correlation could be found between age and plasma P09172 . In hemodialysed patients basal P09172 levels were significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) decreased ( 32.5 % /- 17.6 IU ) , suggesting lowered sympathetic activity and/or abnormalities in release , distribution space , or metabolism of P09172 . During hemodialysis plasma P09172 activity rose during ultrafiltration . This finding indicates a directionally appropriate sympathetic reflex response to volume depletion in dialysed patients .
