Identification , characterization and rescue of a novel vasopressin-2 receptor mutation causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . OBJECTIVE : X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( XNDI ) , caused by mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor ( P30518 ) , is clinically distinguished from central diabetes insipidus ( CDI ) by elevated serum vasopressin ( AVP ) levels and unresponsiveness to 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin ( DB00035 ) . We report two infants with XNDI , and present the characterization and functional rescue of a novel P30518 mutation . PATIENTS : Two male infants presented with poor growth and hypernatraemia . Both patients had measurable pretreatment serum AVP and polyuria that did not respond to DB00035 , suggesting NDI . However , both also had absent posterior pituitary bright spot on Q9BWK5 , which is a finding more typical of CDI . METHODS : The P30518 gene encoding P30518 was sequenced . The identified novel missense mutation was re-created by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in HEK293 cells . P30518 activity was assessed by the ability of transfected cells to produce DB02527 in response to stimulation with DB00035 . Membrane localization of P30518 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy . RESULTS : Patient 1 had a deletion of P30518 ; patient 2 had the novel mutation L57R . In transiently transfected HEK293 cells , DB00035 induced detectable but severely impaired L57R P30518 activity compared to cells expressing wild-type P30518 . Fluorescence microscopy showed that myc-tagged wild-type P30518 localized to the cell membrane while L57R P30518 remained intracellular . A nonpeptide P30518 chaperone , SR121463 , partially rescued L57R P30518 function by allowing it to reach the cell membrane . CONCLUSIONS : L57R P30518 has impaired in vitro activity that can be partially improved by treatment with a P30518 chaperone . The posterior pituitary hyperintensity may be absent in infants with XNDI .
