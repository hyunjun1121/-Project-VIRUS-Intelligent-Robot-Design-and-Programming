Augmentation of methamphetamine-induced behaviors in transgenic mice lacking the trace amine-associated receptor 1 . The trace amine-associated receptor 1 ( Q96RJ0 ) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is functionally activated by amphetamine-based psychostimulants , including amphetamine , methamphetamine and DB01454 . Previous studies have shown that in transgenic mice lacking the Q96RJ0 gene ( Q96RJ0 knockout ; KO ) a single injection of amphetamine can produce enhanced behavioral responses compared to responses evoked in wild-type ( WT ) mice . Further , the psychostimulant effects of cocaine can be diminished by selective activation of Q96RJ0 . These findings suggest that Q96RJ0 might be implicated in the rewarding properties of psychostimulants . To investigate the role of Q96RJ0 in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse , the psychomotor stimulating effects of amphetamine and methamphetamine and the conditioned rewarding effects of methamphetamine and morphine were compared between WT and Q96RJ0 KO mice . In locomotor activity studies , both single and repeated exposure to DB01576 or methamphetamine generated significantly higher levels of total distance traveled in Q96RJ0 KO mice compared to WT mice . In conditioned place preference ( CPP ) studies , Q96RJ0 KO mice acquired methamphetamine-induced CPP earlier than WT mice and retained CPP longer during extinction training . In morphine-induced CPP , both WT and KO genotypes displayed similar levels of CPP . Results from locomotor activity studies suggest that Q96RJ0 may have a modulatory role in the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine-based psychostimulants . That methamphetamine-but not morphine-induced CPP was augmented in Q96RJ0 KO mice suggests a selective role of Q96RJ0 in the conditioned reinforcing effects of methamphetamine . Collectively , these findings provide support for a regulatory role of Q96RJ0 in methamphetamine signaling .
