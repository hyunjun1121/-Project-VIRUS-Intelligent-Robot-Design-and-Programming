Effects of progestins on local estradiol biosynthesis and action in the Z-12 endometriotic epithelial cell line . Endometriosis is a common estrogen-dependent gynecological disease . In patients with endometriosis estradiol can be synthesized locally in the endometriotic lesions from inactive precursors of adrenal or ovarian origin , via the aromatase pathway . These increased estradiol levels stimulate proliferation of endometriotic tissue . The progestins have been used in the therapy of endometriosis for more than 40 years but their pharmacological action is still not understood in detail . In the present study we therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of three progestins most commonly used in the therapy of endometriosis ; medroxyprogesterone acetate , dydrogesterone and dienogest on expression of all genes encoding enzymes of the aromatase pathway and estrogen receptors in the Z-12 model epithelial cell line of peritoneal endometriosis , by qPCR and Western blotting . Our results show that application of medroxyprogestrone acetate , dydrogesterone and dienogest significantly decreases P14061 and P11511 expression and significantly increases P37059 expression . Dydrogesterone and dienogest also significantly suppress P03372 and Q92731 transcription , whereas medroxyprogestrone acetate and dydrogesterone significantly reduce mRNA levels of Q99527 . Our results thus suggest that in peritoneal endometriosis the beneficial effects of these progestins can be explained by lower P14061 and higher P37059 mRNA and protein levels , which lead to reduced local E2 biosynthesis . Although progestins significantly decrease P11511 mRNA levels , the protein itself was not detectable by Western blotting . As progestins down-regulate expression of P03372 , Q92731 and Q99527 , they might also prevent E2-mediated proliferation .
