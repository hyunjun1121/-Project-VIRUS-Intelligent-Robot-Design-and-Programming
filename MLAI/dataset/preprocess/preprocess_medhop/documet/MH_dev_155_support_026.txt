Bacterial superantigens bypass Lck-dependent T cell receptor signaling by activating a Galpha11-dependent , P98160 -beta-mediated pathway . The paradigm to explain antigen-dependent T cell receptor ( TCR ) signaling is based on the activation of the P01730 or CD8 coreceptor-associated kinase Lck . It is widely assumed that this paradigm is also applicable to signaling by bacterial superantigens . However , these bacterial toxins can activate human T cells lacking Lck , suggesting the existence of an additional pathway of TCR signaling . Here we showed that this alternative pathway operates in the absence of Lck-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylation events and was initiated by the TCR-dependent activation of raft-enriched heterotrimeric Galpha11 proteins . This event , in turn , activated a phospholipase C-beta and protein kinase C-mediated cascade that turned on the mitogen-activated protein kinases P27361 and P28482 , triggered Ca(2+) influx , and translocated the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-kappaB to the nucleus , ultimately inducing the production of interleukin-2 in Lck-deficient T cells . The triggering of this alternative pathway by superantigens suggests that these toxins use a G protein-coupled receptor as a coreceptor on T cells .
