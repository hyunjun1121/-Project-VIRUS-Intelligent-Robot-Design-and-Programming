Diverse matrix metalloproteinase functions regulate cancer amoeboid migration . Rounded-amoeboid cancer cells use actomyosin contractility driven by Rho-ROCK and JAK- P40763 to migrate efficiently . It has been suggested that rounded-amoeboid cancer cells do not require matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) to invade . Here we compare MMP levels in rounded-amoeboid and elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cells . Surprisingly , we find that rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells secrete higher levels of several MMPs , including collagenase P45452 and gelatinase P14780 . As a result , rounded-amoeboid melanoma cells degrade collagen I more efficiently than elongated-mesenchymal cells . Furthermore , using a non-catalytic mechanism , P14780 promotes rounded-amoeboid 3D migration through regulation of actomyosin contractility via P16070 receptor . P14780 is upregulated in a panel of rounded-amoeboid compared with elongated-mesenchymal melanoma cell lines and its levels are controlled by ROCK-JAK- P40763 signalling . P14780 expression increases during melanoma progression and it is particularly prominent in the invasive fronts of lesions , correlating with cell roundness . Therefore , rounded-amoeboid cells use both catalytic and non-catalytic activities of MMPs for invasion .
