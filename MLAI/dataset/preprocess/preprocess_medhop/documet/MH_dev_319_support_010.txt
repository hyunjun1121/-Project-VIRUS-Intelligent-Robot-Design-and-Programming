[ DB05812 acetate : a novel therapeutic option in hormone-refractory prostate cancer ] . Until recently , only therapy with docetaxel and prednisone has been shown to prolong survival in men with hormonorefractory metastatic prostate cancer . With approvals of sipuleucel-T , cabazitaxel , and abiraterone acetate , all based on improvement in overall survival , the scenary for management of men with metastatic prostate cancer has dramatically changed . DB05812 acetate was developed to specifically inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP)17A1 , which is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of testosterone . In the phase III , the trial treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone prolongs overall survival relative to prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have disease progression after treatment with docetaxel and associated with an acceptable tolerability profile , which was generally similar to that of the placebo plus prednisone group . However , adverse events resulting from elevated mineralocorticoid levels because of P05093 inhibition , fluid retention and oedema , hypokalaemia , hypertension occurred in significantly more in abiraterone acetate plus prednisone than in placebo plus prednisone .
