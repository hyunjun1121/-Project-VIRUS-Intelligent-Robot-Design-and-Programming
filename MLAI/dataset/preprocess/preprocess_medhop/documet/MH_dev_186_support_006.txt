[ Late appearance of Philadelphia chromosome with the P78357 P11274 / P00519 chimeric transcript in acute myelogenous leukemia progressing from myelodysplastic syndrome ] . We report a late appearance of the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) with the P78357 P11274 / P00519 chimeric transcript in a 69-year-old patient with acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) that had evolved from myelodysplastic syndrome ( P43034 ) . In July 1997 , the patient was found to have pancytopenia caused by refractory anemia with excess of blasts , which evolved into AML in 4 months . The leukemic cells were positive for P15144 , P08571 , P20138 , and HLA-DR and had a normal karyotype . The patient achieved a complete remission after combination chemotherapy . However , his leukemia relapsed in November 1999 , with the appearance of leukemic cells positive for P09564 , P15144 , P28906 , and HLA-DR with a 46 , XY , add ( 18 ) ( p11 ) karyotype . The patient failed to achieve the second remission after several courses of intensive chemotherapy . When the number of blastic cells , showing the same surface phenotypes , in the peripheral blood increased drastically in April 2000 , chromosomal analysis of leukemic cells revealed a 46 , XY , t(9;22) ( q34;q11 ) , add(18)(p11) karyotype . The fusion of the P11274 and P00519 genes was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis , and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis further revealed the presence of the P78357 P11274 / P00519 chimeric transcript . The appearance of the Ph chromosome in the course of P43034 transforming to AML is very rare and may be correlated to the disease progression .
