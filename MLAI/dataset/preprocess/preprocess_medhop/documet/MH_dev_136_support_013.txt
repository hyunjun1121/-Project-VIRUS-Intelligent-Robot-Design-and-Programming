Assessing tumor mutations to gain insight into base excision repair sequence polymorphisms and smoking in colon cancer . DNA repair enzymes function in major pathways to reverse DNA damage , including base excision repair ( BER ) . Missense polymorphisms in BER repair genes may contribute to differences in DNA repair capacity , specific mutations , and susceptibility to cancer in the presence of exposure to carcinogens such as cigarette smoking . In a study of 1,604 incident colon cancer cases and 1,969 matched population-based controls genotyped for BER variants O15527 ( S326C ) and P18887 ( R194W , R280H , and R399Q ) , we found no associations with colon cancer overall . However , a 2-fold increased risk of P15056 V600E tumor mutation was observed in current and former cigarette smokers homozygous for the O15527 polymorphism ( odds ratio , 2.2 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.02-4.9 , recessive model ) ; similar associations were not observed for microsatellite instability , CpG island methylator phenotype , P01116 mutations , or P04637 mutations . The P18887 R194W polymorphism was associated with a modest increased risk of P04637 tumor mutations in those who regularly smoked cigarettes ( odds ratio , 1.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.02-1.9 ) . These findings point to the importance of studying tumor mutations when examining DNA repair polymorphisms and cigarette smoke exposure to identify potentially relevant associations with colorectal cancer .
