P00747 activator dependent pathways in the dissemination of human tumor cells in the chick embryo . We have previously shown that inhibition of uPA activity of a human tumor-HEp3-results in a drastic reduction of its metastasis in the chick embryo . Using 125IUdR-labeled tumor cells , we have now studied the role of uPA in individual steps of tumor metastasis . We found that , 48 hr after inoculation of tumor cells on the P62158 , the organs of the embryos , inoculated with cells in which uPA was inhibited , contained 4-fold less cells than the controls . Neither the initial advance of the tumor mass into the P62158 nor the process of extravasation was affected by the inhibition of tumor uPA . However , the infiltration of the P62158 mesenchyme by individual tumor cells was blocked when tumor uPA activity or production was inhibited . In addition , indirect evidence implicated uPA as an essential factor in the tumor cell intravasation .
