Cloning of chick cellular retinol-binding protein , type II and comparison to that of some mammals : expression of the gene at different developmental stages , and possible involvement of RXRs and Q07869 . We cloned chick cellular retinol-binding protein , type two ( P09455 II ) cDNA and compared it with those of some mammals . The deduced amino acid sequence showed that chick P09455 II was one amino acid greater in size than those of mammals , and the nucleotide sequence of chick P09455 II shared 72 % -75 % similarity with those of mammals . RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that P09455 II transcript of 0.7 kb was first detected in the duodenum of day-18 embryonic chick , and exhibited a rapid increase during 24 hr around the hatching . Northern blot hybridization also revealed that the transcripts of two types of retinoid X receptors ( RXR alpha and RXR gamma ) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) were expressed in the chick duodenum at hatching . The organ culture of day 16 embryonic chick duodenum showed that the addition of 9-cis retinoic acid in the medium caused a significant increase in P09455 II mRNA levels . In addition , arachidonic acid , from which putative ligands for Q07869 were supposed to be generated , was accumulated around hatching in the duodenum . The results may suggest that the abrupt increase of the P09455 II gene expression in the chick duodenum around hatching may be related with RXRs and/or Q07869 .
