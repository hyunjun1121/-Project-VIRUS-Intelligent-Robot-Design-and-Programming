Altered gene expression in the spleen of adolescent rats following high ethanol concentration binge drinking . Binge drinking of alcoholic beverages among adolescents is a common practice that can have serious health consequences . DB00898 is a potent immunomodulator that alters a wide range of immune responses . However , it is unclear whether there is a differential immune response to alcoholic beverages with a high versus low concentration of ethanol . In this study , we used a PCR array containing 46 primer pairs of selected genes to compare mRNA expression in the spleen , an immune system organ , of adolescent rats following binge drinking of alcohol solutions containing either 20 % or 52 % ethanol ( v/v , 4.8 g/kg daily dosage ) , or water ( control ) for 3 d . We found that , expression of IL-1β , P05231 , P13500 , and GABA(A) receptor α2 subunit in the spleen were decreased , and P41594 and P46098 receptor expression were increased after administration of an ethanol solution containing 52 % ethanol , but not one with 20 % ethanol . Our data suggest that alcohol-mediated immunomodulatory effects are , in part , dependent on the ethanol by volume concentration . This is the first study to show that exposure to a high ethanol percentage beverage can have more profound effects on immune responses than one with a low percentage of ethanol .
