DB01017 effects on cerebral edema : relations with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers following traumatic brain injury in mice . One of the severe complications following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is cerebral edema and its effective treatment is of great interest to prevent further brain damage . This study investigated the effects of minocycline , known for its anti-inflammatory properties , on cerebral edema and its respective inflammatory markers by comparing different dose regimens , on oxidative stress and on neurological dysfunction following TBI . The weight drop model was used to induce TBI in mice . The brain water content was measured to evaluate cerebral edema . Inflammatory markers were detected by ELISA ( IL-1beta ) , zymography and Western blot ( P14780 ) . The oxidative stress marker ( glutathione levels ) and neurological function were measured by Griffith technique and string test , respectively . DB01017 was administered i.p. once ( 5 min ) , twice ( 5 min and 3 h ) or triple ( 5 min , 3 h and 9 h ) following TBI . The first dose of minocycline only varied ( 45 or 90 mg/kg ) , whereas the following doses were all at 45 mg/kg . The single and double administrations of minocycline reduced the increase of inflammatory markers at 6 h post-TBI . DB01017 also reduced cerebral edema at this time point , only after double administration and at the high dose regimen , although with no effect on the TBI-induced oxidized glutathione increase . The anti-edematous effect of minocycline persisted up to 24 h , upon a triple administration , and accompanied by a neurological recovery . In conclusion , we reported an anti-edematous effect of minocycline after TBI in mice according to a specific treatment regimen . These findings emphasize that the beneficial effects of minocycline depend on the treatment regimen following a brain injury .
