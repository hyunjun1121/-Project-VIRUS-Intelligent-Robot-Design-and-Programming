Activation of PKC but not of P29323 is required for vitamin E-succinate-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells . DB00163 -succinate ( VES ) induced HL-60 human leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis . Treatment with VES induced membrane translocation of Fas ; cleavages of caspase-3 , PARP , and lamin B ; hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein ; and increase of P38936 ( P38936 ) protein level . During the induction of apoptosis , activity of PKC was gradually increased with downregulation of VES-induced P29323 activity and accompanied by activation of caspase-3 . Inhibition of PKC by GF109203X blocked VES-mediated membrane translocation of P17252 and cleavage of caspase-3 cascade , resulting in prevention of VES-induced apoptosis . On the contrary , PKC activation by cotreatment with Q16549 or thapsigargin and VES synergistically increased VES-mediated apoptosis . However , inhibition of P29323 activity by PD98059 showed no significant effect on VES-induced PKC activity and apoptosis . Taken together , our data suggest that VES induces activation of PKC and PKC-dependent hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein , which results in induction of apoptosis , and that VES-induced early activation of P29323 and P29323 -dependent induction of P38936 ( P38936 ) are not required for apoptosis .
