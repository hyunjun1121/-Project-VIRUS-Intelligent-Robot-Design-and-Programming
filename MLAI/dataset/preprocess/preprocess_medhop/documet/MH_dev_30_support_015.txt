Association of the P08637 -158F/V gene polymorphism with the response to rituximab treatment in Spanish systemic autoimmune disease patients . DB00073 is being used as treatment for systemic autoimmune diseases . The objective of this study was to determine whether the genetic variant in the Fc gamma-receptor III a ( P08637 ) gene , 158F/V , contributes to the observed variation in response to rituximab in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases . DNA samples from 132 Spanish patients with different systemic autoimmune diseases receiving rituximab were genotyped for P08637 -158F/V ( rs396991 ) gene polymorphism using the TaqMan(Â®) allelic discrimination technology . Six months after infusion with rituximab we evaluated the response to the drug : 61 % of the patients showed a complete response , partial 27 % and 12 % did not respond to the treatment . A statistically significant difference was observed in V allele frequency between responder ( 38 % ) and nonresponder ( 16 % ) patients ( p=0.01 ; odds ratio [OR]=3.24 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.17-11.1 ) . DB00073 was also more effective in V allele carriers ( 94 % ) than in homozygous FF patients ( 81 % ) : p=0.02 ; OR=3.96 , 95 % CI 1.10-17.68 . These results suggest that P08637 -158F/V ( rs396991 ) gene polymorphism play a role in the response to rituximab in autoimmune diseases . Validation of these findings in independent cohorts is warranted .
