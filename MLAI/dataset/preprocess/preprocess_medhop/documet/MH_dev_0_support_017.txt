Expression of serotonergic system components during early Xenopus embryogenesis . Despite abundant research studies on the physiological and biochemical nature of embryonic neurotransmitter function , little is known about the molecular genetic mechanisms involved . The expression of the main components of the serotonergic system during early Xenopus embryogenesis was investigated using RT-PCR , real time PCR and in situ hybridization . Transcripts encoding the serotonin receptors P28335 and P34969 , as well as the vesicular monoamine transporter Q05940 , the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) and the serotonin synthesis enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase ( Q8IWU9 ) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( AAAD ) were found to be expressed during the cleavage division stages , whereas the degradation enzyme monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 ) was absent . The main components of the serotonergic system were found to be expressed during the earliest stages of embryonic development . The embryonic transmitter mechanism , its complexity , and its variability among various species are discussed .
