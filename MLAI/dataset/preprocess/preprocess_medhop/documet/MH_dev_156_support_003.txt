Cyclooxygenase inhibition abrogates aeroallergen-induced immune tolerance by suppressing prostaglandin I2 receptor signaling . BACKGROUND : The prevalence of allergic diseases has doubled in developed countries in the past several decades . Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -inhibiting drugs augmented allergic diseases in mice by increasing allergic sensitization and memory immune responses . However , whether P36551 inhibition can promote allergic airway diseases by inhibiting immune tolerance is not known . OBJECTIVE : To determine the role of the P36551 pathway and prostaglandin I2 ( DB01240 ) signaling through the P43119 ( IP ) in aeroallergen-induced immune tolerance . METHODS : Wild-type ( WT ) BALB/c mice and IP knockout mice were aerosolized with ovalbumin ( OVA ) to induce immune tolerance prior to immune sensitization with an intraperitoneal injection of OVA/alum . The P36551 inhibitor indomethacin or vehicle was administered in drinking water to inhibit enzyme activity during the sensitization phase . Two weeks after sensitization , the mice were challenged with OVA aerosols . Mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was harvested for cell counts and TH2 cytokine measurements . RESULTS : WT mice treated with indomethacin had greater numbers of total cells , eosinophils , and lymphocytes , and increased P05113 and P35225 protein expression in BAL fluid compared to vehicle-treated mice . Similarly , IP knockout mice had augmented inflammation and TH2 cytokine responses compared to WT mice . In contrast , the DB01240 analog cicaprost attenuated the anti-tolerance effect of P36551 inhibition . CONCLUSION : P36551 inhibition abrogated immune tolerance by suppressing DB01240 IP signaling , suggesting that DB01240 signaling promotes immune tolerance and that clinical use of P36551 -inhibiting drugs may increase the risk of developing allergic diseases .
