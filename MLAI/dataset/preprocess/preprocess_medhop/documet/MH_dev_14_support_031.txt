Direct injection of calcitriol or its analog improves abnormal gene expression in the hyperplastic parathyroid gland in uremia . AIMS : In this study , we investigated the effects of direct injection ( DI ) of calcitriol or maxacalcitol into the hyperplastic parathyroid gland ( PTG ) on altered gene expression related to the advanced status of secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) . METHODS : Sprague-Dawley rats were 5/6-nephrectomized ( uremic ) or sham-operated ( normal ) . In each uremic rat , one of the bilateral PTG was treated by DI of calcitriol ( PTG( Q9HD26 ) ) or maxacalcitol ( PTG( O75051 ) ) , and the other gland was treated with control solution ( PTG(CONT) ) . The PTG were evaluated for levels of expression of various mRNA and immunohistochemical staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) . RESULTS : Significant differences in levels of expression of mRNA and P12004 were confirmed between the uremic and normal groups . In PTG( Q9HD26 ) and PTG( O75051 ) , expressions of almost all mRNA and P12004 were significantly improved ; both agents were able to normalize the abnormalities of the uremic PTG , in contrast to the baseline and individual PTG(CONT) . However , the difference in effect between PTG( Q9HD26 ) and PTG( O75051 ) was only small . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that very high concentrations of calcitriol or maxacalcitol in the PTG improve abnormal gene expression and proliferation activity of parathyroid cells , and might explain the better control of SHPT using the DI technique .
