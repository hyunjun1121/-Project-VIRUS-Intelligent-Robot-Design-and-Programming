P14416 -mediated epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation through a disintegrin and metalloprotease regulates dopaminergic neuron development via extracellular signal-related kinase activation . P14416 ( D2R ) -mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) activation plays an important role in the development of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons . Here , we demonstrate that D2R induces the shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) through the activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease ( ADAM ) 10 or 17 , leading to P01133 receptor transactivation , downstream P29323 activation , and ultimately an increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons and their neurite length in primary mesencephalic cultures from wild-type mice . These outcomes , however , were not observed in cultures from D2R knock-out mice . Our findings show that D2R-mediated P29323 activation regulates mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron development via P01133 receptor transactivation through O14672 /17 .
