Elevated CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells correlate with prolonged survival in glioblastoma patients despite integrated immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and at the systemic level . We characterized GBM patients ' tumor and systemic immune contexture with aim to reveal the mechanisms of immunological escape , their impact on patient outcome , and identify targets for immunotherapy . Increased CD3(+) T-cell infiltration was associated with prolonged survival independent of age , P16455 promoter methylation and post-operative treatment that implies potential for immunotherapy for GBM . Several mechanisms of escape were identified : within the tumor microenvironment : induced CD8(+) P10747 (-)Foxp3(+) Tregs that may tolerize antigen presenting cells , elevated CD73 and P49961 ectonucleotidases that suppress T-cell function , and at the systemic level : elevated P22301 levels in serum , diminished helper T-cell counts , and upregulated inhibitory P16410 .
