DB00067 -induced P04275 secretion from endothelial cells involves V2 receptors and DB02527 . DB00067 and its analogue DB00035 ( DB00035 ) are known to raise plasma P04275 ( P04275 ) levels . DB00035 is used as a hemostatic agent for the treatment of von Willebrand 's disease . However , its cellular mechanisms of action have not been elucidated . DB00035 , a specific agonist for the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) , exerts its antidiuretic effect via a rise in DB02527 in kidney collecting ducts . We tested the hypothesis that DB00035 induces P04275 secretion by binding to P30518 and activating DB02527 -mediated signaling in endothelial cells . P04275 secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) can be mediated by DB02527 , but DB00035 is ineffective , presumably due to the absence of P30518 . We report that DB00035 stimulates P04275 secretion in a DB02527 -dependent manner in HUVECs after transfection of the P30518 . In addition , vasopressin and DB00035 induce P04275 secretion in human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVEC-L ) . These cells ( but not HUVECs ) express endogenous P30518 , as shown by RT-PCR . DB00067 -induced P04275 secretion is mimicked by DB00035 and inhibited by the selective P30518 antagonist SR121463B . It is mediated by DB02527 , since it is inhibited by the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-8CPT-cAMPS . These results indicate that vasopressin induces DB02527 -mediated P04275 secretion by a direct effect on endothelial cells . They also demonstrate functional expression of P30518 in endothelial cells , and provide a cellular mechanism for the hemostatic effects of DB00035 .
