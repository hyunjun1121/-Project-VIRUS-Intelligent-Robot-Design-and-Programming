The effect of chronic antipsychotic drug on hypothalamic expression of neural nitric oxide synthase and dopamine D2 receptor in the male rat . Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is a common and serious clinical side effect . It has been demonstrated that both neuronal nitric oxide ( P29475 ) and dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) in the medial preoptic area ( MPOA ) and the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) of the hypothalamus have important roles in the regulation of sexual behaviour . We investigated the influences of 21 days ' antipsychotic drug administration on expression of P29475 and P14416 in the rat hypothalamus . DB00502 ( 0.5 mg/kg/day i.p. ) significantly decreased P29475 integrated optical density in a sub-nucleus of the MPOA , medial preoptic nucleus ( Q9BQR3 ) , and decreased the P29475 integrated optical density and cell density in another sub-nucleus of the MPOA , anterodorsal preoptic nucleus ( ADP ) . DB00734 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) inhibited the P29475 integrated optical density in the ADP. P29475 mRNA and protein in the MPOA but not the PVN was also significantly decreased by haloperidol . DB00502 and risperidone increased P14416 mRNA and protein expression in both the MPOA and the PVN . Quetiapine ( 20 mg/kg/day i.p. ) did not influence the expression of P29475 and P14416 in either the MPOA or the PVN . These findings indicate that hypothalamic P29475 and P14416 are affected to different extents by chronic administration of risperidone and haloperidol , but are unaffected by quetiapine . These central effects might play a role in sexual dysfunction induced by certain antipsychotic drugs .
