F-actin involvement in guinea pig sperm motility . Sperm motility is a must for natural fertilization to occur . During their travel through the epididymis , mammalian spermatozoa gradually acquire the ability to move . This is accomplished through a sliding movement of the outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme which is energized by the dynein ATPase . Within its complex structure , the mammalian sperm flagellum contains F-actin and thus , we decided to test in the guinea pig sperm flagellum the role of F-actin in motility . During maturation , capacitation , and the acrosome reaction , a gradual decrease of the relative concentration of F-actin was observed . Motility increased as spermatozoa became able to fertilize . P06396 , phalloidin , and KI inhibited sperm motility . P06396 canceled sperm motility within 20 min of treatment while 0.6 M KI had immediate effects . Phalloidin diminished hyperactive sperm motility slightly . All three compounds significantly increased the relative concentration of F-actin . Latrunculins are conventional drugs that destabilize the F-actin cytoskeleton . DB02621 ( O43561 A ) did not affect sperm motility ; but significantly increased F-actin relative concentration . The results suggested that in guinea pig spermatozoa , randomly severing F-actin filaments inhibits flagellar motility ; while end filament alteration does not . Thus , specific filament regions seem to be important for sperm motility .
