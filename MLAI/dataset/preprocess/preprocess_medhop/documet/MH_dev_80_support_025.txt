Gene transfer of GM- P04141 , P33681 and CD154 cDNA enhances survival in a murine model of acute leukemia with persistence of a minimal residual disease . Gene transfer of various cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules has been reported to induce a potent antileukemic immunity in murine models , however , the relative efficiency and possible synergistic effects between candidate genes have not been extensively investigated . We analyzed in a murine model of P11274 / P00519 acute leukemia whether gene transfer of CD154 , P33681 or GM- P04141 as a single agent or combination of CD154 + GM- P04141 , P33681 + CD154 and GM- P04141 + P33681 in leukemic cells could enhance survival . We observed that CD154 gene transfer induced a marked inhibition of leukemogenicity , and also that CD154 and combination of GM- P04141 and P33681 gene transfer protected mice against subsequent challenge with leukemic cells and had a therapeutic effect for a pre-established leukemia disease . We also found minimal residual leukemic disease by RT-PCR for 6 to 12 months in 0 to 25 % of animals injected with transduced leukemic cells and surviving the challenge without evidence of disease , except in the control empty plasmid group where very few mice survived the challenge but all of those were positive by RT-PCR . These findings suggest that leukemic cell vaccination by gene transfer can induce a tumor dormancy phenomenon compatible with long-term survival .
