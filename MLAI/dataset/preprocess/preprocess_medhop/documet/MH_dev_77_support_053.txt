Evidence for anterograde transport and transcytosis of botulinum neurotoxin A ( DB00083 ) . Botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) is a metalloprotease that blocks synaptic transmission via the cleavage of P60880 ( synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa ) . DB00083 is successfully used in clinical neurology for the treatment of several neuromuscular pathologies and pain syndromes . Despite its widespread use , relatively little is known on DB00083 intracellular trafficking in neurons . Using the visual pathway as a model system , here we show that catalytically active DB00083 is capable of undergoing anterograde axonal transport and transcytosis . Following DB00083 injection into the rat eye , significant levels of DB00083 -cleaved P60880 appeared in the retinorecipient layers of the superior colliculus ( SC ) . Anterograde propagation of DB00083 effects required axonal transport , ruling out a systemic spread of the toxin . Cleaved P60880 was present in presynaptic structures of the tectum , but retinal terminals were devoid of the immunoreactivity , indicative of transcytosis . Experiments based on sequential administration of DB00083 and BoNT/E showed a persistent catalytic activity of DB00083 in tectal cells following its injection into the retina . Our findings demonstrate that catalytically active DB00083 is anterogradely transported from the eye to the SC and transcytosed to tectal synapses . These data are important for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of action of DB00083 .
