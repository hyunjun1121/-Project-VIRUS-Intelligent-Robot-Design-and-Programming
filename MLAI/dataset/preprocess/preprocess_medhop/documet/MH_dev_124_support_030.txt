Progenitor cells harvested from bovine follicles become endothelial cells . Hematopoietic-like colonies develop in post-confluent granulosa cell cultures derived from bovine antral follicles . Previously , we had shown that these colonies gave rise to macrophages . In the present study , we validated the presence of somatic P10721 -positive ( P10721 (+) ) progenitor cells in colony-containing granulosa cell cultures . The cultures expressed the progenitor cell markers Sox-2 , Oct 3/4 , P10721 , and alkaline phosphatase in western blot analysis . The successful double immunofluorescence localization of P10721 and P08571 , P08575 , CD133 , or P15692 -R2 revealed a specific subpopulation of progenitor cells . Flow cytometry showed that cells doubly positive for P10721 and P08571 or P08575 comprised less than 10 % of the population . The P10721 (+) cells were purified by magnetic selection and differentiated with the hanging drop technique using haematopoietic differentiation medium . Pure cultures of either granulosa cells or endothelial cells were obtained . The spindle-shaped and epithelioid phenotypes indicated endothelial cell heterogeneity of microvascular source . We conclude that progenitor cells are obtained from the follicle harvest , which differentiate into endothelial cells . The cells are relevant for findings to angiogenesis and luteinization of the corpus luteum .
