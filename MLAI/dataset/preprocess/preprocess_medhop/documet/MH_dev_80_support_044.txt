DB06186 : an anti- P16410 antibody for metastatic melanoma . DB06186 ( DB06186 , Yervoy ; Bristol-Myers Squibb ) , a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTL antigen 4 ( P16410 ) , was recently approved by the U.S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma . In both early- and late-phase trials , ipilimumab has shown consistent activity against melanoma . For example , in a randomized phase III trial that enrolled patients with previously treated metastatic disease , ipilimumab , with or without a peptide vaccine , improved overall survival : Median overall survival was 10.1 and 10.0 months in the ipilimumab and ipilimumab plus vaccine arms , respectively , versus 6.4 months in the vaccine-alone group ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; P â‰¤ 0.003 ) . Serious ( grade 3-5 ) immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 % to 15 % of patients . Thus , although it provides a clear survival benefit , ipilimumab administration requires careful patient monitoring and sometimes necessitates treatment with immune-suppressive therapy . Here , we review the mechanism of action , preclinical data , and multiple clinical trials that led to FDA approval of ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma .
