Calcimimetic and calcilytic drugs for treating bone and mineral-related disorders . The calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) plays a pivotal role in regulating systemic Ca(2+) homeostasis and is a target for drugs designed to treat certain disorders of bone and mineral metabolism . Calcimimetics are agonists or positive allosteric modulators of the P41180 ; they inhibit parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) secretion and stimulate renal Ca(2+) excretion . The first calcimimetic drug is cinacalcet , a positive allosteric modulator of the P41180 that is approved for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism ( Q9HD23 ) in patients on renal replacement therapy and for some forms of primary Q9HD23 characterized by clinically significant hypercalcemia . DB01012 is also being investigated as a therapy for other hypercalcemic conditions and certain hypophosphatemic disorders . Calcilytics are P41180 inhibitors that stimulate the secretion of PTH and decrease renal excretion of Ca(2+) . Although calcilytics have failed thus far as anabolic therapies for osteoporosis , they are currently being evaluated as novel therapies for new indications involving hypocalcemia and/or hypercalciuria .
