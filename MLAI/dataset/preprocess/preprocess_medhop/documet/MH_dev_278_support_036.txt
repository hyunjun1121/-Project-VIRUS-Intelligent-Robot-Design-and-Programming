DB02709 attenuates the release of inflammatory cytokines from human bronchial smooth muscle cells exposed to lipoteichoic acid in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . During bacterial infections , pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) induce cytokine/chemokine release in immunoactive cells . This increases corticosteroid-resistant airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) and leads to exacerbations . Anti-inflammatory therapies other than corticosteroids are required and resveratrol is currently under discussion . DB02709 is an activator of sirtuins , which are class III histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) . We suggested that human airway smooth muscle cells ( HASMCs ) release P48444 -associated cytokines/chemokines in response to lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) , a major Q96TA2 of gram-positive bacteria and that resveratrol is superior to the corticosteroid dexamethasone in suppressing these cytokines/chemokines . Cultivated HASMCs of patients with P48444 were pre-incubated with resveratrol or dexamethasone before stimulation with P01374 . P13500 , GM- P04141 , P05231 and P10145 were analysed in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Drug effects were investigated in the absence and presence of trichostatin A ( P32119 ) , an inhibitor of class I/II HDACs , and EX527 , an inhibitor of the sirtuin Q96EB6 . P01374 induced robust cytokine/chemokine release . DB02709 was superior to dexamethasone in reducing DB00833 -2 , P05231 and P10145 in P01374 -exposed HASMCs of patients with P48444 . Both drugs were equally effective in reducing GM- P04141 . DB02709 effects were partially reversed by EX527 but not by P32119 . Dexamethasone effects were partially reversed by P32119 but not by EX527 . We conclude that HASMCs contribute to the increase in airway inflammation in P48444 exacerbations caused by gram-positive bacterial infections . Our data suggest resveratrol as an alternative anti-inflammatory therapy in infection-induced P48444 exacerbations . DB02709 and corticosteroids suppress cytokine/chemokine expression through activation of Q96EB6 or interaction with class I/II HDACs , respectively , in HASMCs .
