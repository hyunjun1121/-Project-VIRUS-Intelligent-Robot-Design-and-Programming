Rosiglitazone affects nitric oxide synthases and improves renal outcome in a rat model of severe ischemia/reperfusion injury . Background. DB00435 ( NO ) -signal transduction plays an important role in renal ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury . NO produced by endothelial NO-synthase ( P29474 ) has protective functions whereas NO from inducible NO-synthase ( P35228 ) induces impairment . Rosiglitazone ( RGZ ) , a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -Î³ agonist exerted beneficial effects after renal I/R injury , so we investigated whether this might be causally linked with NOS imbalance . Methods . RGZ ( 5 mg/kg ) was administered i.p. to SD-rats ( f ) subjected to bilateral renal ischemia ( 60 min ) . Following 24 h of reperfusion , inulin- and PAH-clearance as well as PAH-net secretion were determined . Morphological alterations were graded by histopathological scoring . Plasma NO(x)-production was measured . P29474 and P35228 expression was analyzed by qPCR . Cleaved caspase 3 ( Q9BUP3 ) was determined as an apoptosis indicator and Q92838 as a marker of macrophage infiltration in renal tissue . Results . RGZ improves renal function after renal I/R injury ( PAH-/inulin-clearance , PAH-net secretion ) and reduces histomorphological injury . Additionally , RGZ reduces NO(x) plasma levels , ED-1 positive cell infiltration and Q9BUP3 expression . P35228 -mRNA is reduced whereas P29474 -mRNA is increased by RGZ . Conclusion . RGZ has protective properties after severe renal I/R injury . Alterations of the NO pathway regarding P29474 and P35228 could be an explanation of the underlying mechanism of RGZ protection in renal I/R injury .
