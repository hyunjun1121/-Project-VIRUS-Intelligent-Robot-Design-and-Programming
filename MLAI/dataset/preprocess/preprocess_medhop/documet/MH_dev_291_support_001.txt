The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway is activated by lipoteichoic acid and plays a role in Kupffer cell production of interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) and P22301 . Sepsis caused by gram-positive bacteria lacking lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) has become a major and increasing cause of mortality in intensive-care units . We have recently demonstrated that the gram-positive-specific bacterial cell wall component lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) stimulates the release of the proinflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells in culture . In the present study , we have started to assess the signal transduction events by which P01374 induces the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , and the anti-inflammatory cytokine P22301 in rat Kupffer cells . P01374 was found to trigger phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) ( p38 MAPK and P29323 1/2 ) and protein kinase B ( P31749 ) . Compared to LPS , P01374 was more potent in inducing P31749 phosphorylation after 40 min , although we found that the cytokine responses were similar . For both bacterial molecules , blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -K ; Ly294002 ) or O60674 ( O60674 ; AG490 ) particularly affected the induction of P05231 and P22301 release , whereas P01375 levels were strongly reduced by inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases ( Q99463 ) . All three cytokines were reduced by inhibition of p38 MAPK ( SB202190 ) or the broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein , whereas P05231 release was particularly blocked by inhibition of P29323 1/2 ( PD98059 ) . Divergences in the regulatory pathways controlling P01375 , P22301 , and P05231 production in Kupffer cells following LPS or P01374 stimulation may create a basis for understanding how the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is regulated in the liver following infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria .
