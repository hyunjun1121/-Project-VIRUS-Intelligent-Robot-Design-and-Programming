Kinase inhibitors : a new class of antirheumatic drugs . The outlook for patients with rheumatoid arthritis has improved significantly over the last three decades with the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs . However , despite the use of methotrexate , cytokine inhibitors , and molecules targeting T and B cells , a percentage of patients do not respond or lose their response over time . The autoimmune process in rheumatoid arthritis depends on activation of immune cells , which utilize intracellular kinases to respond to external stimuli such as cytokines , immune complexes , and antigens . In the past decade , small molecules targeting several kinases , such as p38 MAPK , Syk , and JAK have been developed . Several p38 MAPK inhibitors proved ineffective in treating rheumatoid arthritis . The Syk inhibitor , fostamatinib , proved superior to placebo in Phase II trials and is currently under Phase III investigation . DB08895 , a P23458 /3 inhibitor , was shown to be efficacious in two Phase III trials , while VX-509 , a P52333 inhibitor , showed promising results in a Phase II trial . Fostamatinib and tofacitinib were associated with increased rates of infection , elevation of liver enzymes , and neutropenia . Moreover , fostamatinib caused elevations of blood pressure and diarrhea , while tofacitinib was associated with an increase in creatinine and elevation of lipid levels .
