The mitochondrial pharmacogenomics of haplogroup T : P03891 *LHON4917G and antiretroviral therapy-associated peripheral neuropathy . Peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) due to mitochondrial injury complicates HIV therapy with some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) . Variation in the mitochondrial genome may influence susceptibility to NRTI toxicities . Two non-synonymous mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms , P03886 *LHON4216C ( 4216C ) and P03891 *LHON4917G ( 4917G ) were characterized in HIV-infected participants exposed to NRTIs in a randomized clinical trial . Among 250 self-identified white , non-Hispanic participants , symptomatic PN ( > or = grade 1 ) developed in 70 ( 28 % ) . Both 4216C ( odds ratio (OR)=1.98 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.05-3.75 ) ; P=0.04 ) and 4917G ( OR=2.93 ( 95 % CI 1.25-6.89 ) ; P=0.01 ) were more frequent in PN cases . These two polymorphisms remained independently associated with PN after adjusting for age , baseline P01730 count , plasma HIV RNA level , and NRTI randomization arm ; 4216C ( OR=2.0 ( 95 % CI 1.1-4.0 ) P=0.04 ) and 4917G ( OR=5.5 ( 95 % CI 1.6-18.7 ) P < 0.01 ) . When 4917G individuals were excluded from the analysis , the association with 4216C was no longer seen . The mitochondrial 4917G polymorphism may increase susceptibility to NRTI-associated PN .
