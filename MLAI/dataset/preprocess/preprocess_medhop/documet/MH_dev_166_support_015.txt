Prevention of acute ischemic renal failure by targeted delivery of growth factors to the proximal tubule in transgenic mice : the efficacy of parathyroid hormone-related protein and hepatocyte growth factor . Treatment of acute renal failure ( Q8N726 ) would be enhanced by identification of factors that accelerate renal recovery from injury . P12272 ( P12272 ) and hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) have been shown to stimulate proliferation in proximal nephron-derived cells . For studying the pathophysiologic roles and therapeutic potential of these two factors in Q8N726 , transgenic mice overexpressing P12272 or P14210 in the proximal tubule under the direction of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-I promoter were developed . These mice display ( 1 ) abundant expression of the respective transgenes in the kidney ; ( 2 ) similar PTH type I receptor and P08581 ( c-met ) expression levels in the proximal tubule compared with control littermates ; and ( 3 ) normal renal morphology , function , and tubule cell proliferation under basal conditions . However , in contrast to control mice , when acute ischemic renal injury was induced , renal function rapidly and dramatically recovered in P14210 -overexpressing mice . In addition , 48 h after ischemia , P14210 -overexpressing transgenic mice displayed a fourfold increase in tubule cell proliferation and a threefold decrease in apoptotic tubule cell death compared with control mice . In contrast , P12272 -overexpressing mice responded to either ischemic or folic acid-induced renal damage similarly to control mice . These studies demonstrate that overexpression of P12272 in the proximal nephron of mice does not seem to provide protection against acute renal injury . In marked contrast , P14210 overexpression results in dramatic protection from ischemia-induced Q8N726 , without inducing any apparent alteration in the physiology of the kidney under normal conditions . These studies suggest that P14210 , when targeted specifically to the proximal tubule , may have therapeutic potential in providing protection against ischemia-induced renal failure .
