Second-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) : a better mousetrap ? A review of the clinical evidence . The discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in 2004 heralded the era of molecular targeted therapy in NSCLC . First-generation small molecule , reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) of P00533 , gefitinib and erlotinib , had been approved for second- or third-line treatment of NSCLC prior to the knowledge of these mutations . However , resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib invariably develops after prolonged clinical use . Two second-generation irreversible P00533 TKIs , afatinib ( DB08916 ) and dacomitinib ( PF-00299804 ) , that can potentially overcome the majority of these resistances are in late stage clinical development . Here I will review the clinical data of P00533 TKIs and discuss the appropriate future role of afatinib and dacomitinib in NSCLC : whether as replacement of erlotinib or gefitinib or only after erlotinib or gefitinib failure and whether different subgroups would benefit from different approaches .
