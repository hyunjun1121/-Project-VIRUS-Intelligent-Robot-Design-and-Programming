A curated database of miRNA mediated feed-forward loops involving MYC as master regulator . BACKGROUND : The MYC transcription factors are known to be involved in the biology of many human cancer types . But little is known about the Myc/microRNAs cooperation in the regulation of genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Employing independent databases with experimentally validated data , we identified several mixed microRNA/Transcription Factor Feed-Forward Loops regulated by Myc and characterized completely by experimentally supported regulatory interactions , in human . We then studied the statistical and functional properties of these circuits and discussed in more detail a few interesting examples involving Q01094 , P60484 , P06400 and P15692 . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : We have assembled and characterized a catalogue of human mixed Transcription Factor/microRNA Feed-Forward Loops , having Myc as master regulator and completely defined by experimentally verified regulatory interactions .
