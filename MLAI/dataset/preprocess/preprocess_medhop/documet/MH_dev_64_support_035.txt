[ DB08916 ( DB08916 ) ] . DB08916 ( DB08916 ) is an irreversible multi-target HER receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed in patients with advanced solid tumours . Several phase I studies were conducted in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , as a single agent or in combination . In further phase II or III studies , patients were selected based on the duration of response to first generation P00533 -TKI in previous line ( supposed to have greater chance to have an activating P00533 mutation ) or based directly on the P00533 activating mutation status . Here , we report and comment the main results of these studies in lung cancer patients . This drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2013 for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have P00533 mutation . In Europe , it has been approved in September 2013 in the same indication .
