P19957 kinase/AKT pathway as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma . The development of novel therapies for multiple myeloma depends on a comprehensive understanding of the events leading to cellular proliferation and survival . Controlling pathways that regulate growth signals is an emerging and complementary approach to myeloma treatment . The PI3K/Akt pathway is a central gatekeeper for crucial cellular functions including adhesion , angiogenesis , migration and development of drug resistance . Established proteins and genes such as P42345 , p53 , NF-kappaB and Q92934 are all regulated through PI3K and Akt activation , making them attractive targets for broad downstream effects . Direct PI3K inhibition has demonstrated impressive tumor inhibition and regression in cell-line and animal models , and multiple agents including DB05210 are currently in clinical trials . Drugs such as perifosine that are specific for Akt are also in development . Combinations of these agents with existing therapies are rational approaches on the path to improving myeloma treatment .
