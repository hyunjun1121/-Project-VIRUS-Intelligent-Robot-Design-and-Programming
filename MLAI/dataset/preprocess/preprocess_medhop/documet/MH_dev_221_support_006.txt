No evidence of QT prolongation with supratherapeutic doses of aleglitazar . DB08915 is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -α/γ agonist in clinical development , designed to offer a balanced activation of Q07869 -α and Q07869 -γ . A phase 2 trial has demonstrated improvements in dyslipidemia and glycemic control and reduction of cardiovascular risk markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with aleglitazar . This study evaluated whether supratherapeutic doses of aleglitazar affect cardiac repolarization , as detected by changes in the QT interval.Healthy subjects were randomized to receive single oral doses of placebo , 300 μg aleglitazar , 3000 μg aleglitazar , and 400 mg moxifloxacin , in 1 of 4 sequences . Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram measurements were recorded predose and regularly ( 0.75-72 hours ) after each treatment . The primary outcome was measurement of QT interval using a study-specific correction factor for heart rate.Administration of aleglitazar ( 300 μg and 3000 μg ) did not cause any significant QT prolongation and after aleglitazar treatment any mean increases from placebo were < 5 msec , at all time points . There was a trend for aleglitazar to cause a small dose-dependent decrease in QT interval using a study-specific correction factor for heart rate . The incidence of adverse events was similar with aleglitazar ( 18 % -20 % ) and placebo ( 26 % ) .Single supratherapeutic doses of aleglitazar are not associated with prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate .
