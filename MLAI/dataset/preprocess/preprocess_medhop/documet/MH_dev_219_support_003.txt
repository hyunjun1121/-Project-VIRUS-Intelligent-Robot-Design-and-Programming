DB08901 induces apoptosis in imatinib-resistant human mast cells by dephosphorylating mutant D816V P10721 and silencing β-catenin signaling . Gain-of-function mutations of membrane receptor tyrosine kinase P10721 , especially gatekeeper D816V point mutation in P10721 , render kinase autoactivation , disease progression , and poor prognosis . D816V P10721 is found in approximately 80 % of the patients with systemic mastocytosis , and is resistant to the first and second generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) . The purpose of this investigation was aimed at exploring whether ponatinib ( DB08901 ) , a novel effective TKI against T315I Bcr-Abl , was active against D816V P10721 . We discovered that ponatinib abrogated the phosphorylation of P10721 harboring either V560G ( sensitive to imatinib ) or D816V mutation ( resistant to imatinib ) and the downstream signaling transduction . DB08901 inhibited the growth of D816V P10721 -expressing cells in culture and nude mouse xenografted tumor . DB08901 triggered apoptosis by inducing the release of cytochrome c and O95831 , downregulation of Mcl-1 . Furthermore , ponatinib abrogated the phosphorylation of β-catenin at the site Y654 , suppressed the translocation of β-catenin , and inhibited the transcription and DNA binding of TCF and the expression of its targets ( e.g. , Q9Y2T1 , c-MYC , and P24385 ) . Moreover , ponatinib was highly active against xenografted D816V P10721 tumors in nude mice and significantly prolonged the survival of mice with aggressive systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia by impeding the expansion and infiltration of mast cells with imatinib-resistant D814Y P10721 . Our findings warrant a clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with systemic mastocytosis harboring D816V P10721 .
