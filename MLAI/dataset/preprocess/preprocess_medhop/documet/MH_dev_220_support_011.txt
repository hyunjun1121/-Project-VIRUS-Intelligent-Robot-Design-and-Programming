Newly recognized DB00644 receptors : function and relative role . Hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone ( DB00644 I ) and its pituitary receptor are responsible for the CNS regulation of reproduction . However , a second DB00644 ( DB00644 II ) is also expressed in humans and a gene that resembles the Q96P88 in fish has been identified in humans and monkeys . The amino-acid sequence of this newly identified , seven-transmembrane , G-protein-coupled receptor in monkeys differs from the human DB00644 I receptor by having a C-terminal , cytoplasmic tail . DB00644 II is approximately 400-fold more potent at DB00644 II receptors than DB00644 I receptors . DB00644 I directly inhibits proliferation of human tumor cells , and DB00644 II and its receptor might have a similar role . Limited progress has been made , however , because of difficulty translating the mRNA that encodes the human Q96P88 . Nevertheless , such receptors are likely to exist in humans because DB00644 II is more inhibitory to tumor cell replication than DB00644 I , and DB00644 I and DB00644 II have reciprocal effects on human decidual stromal cells in culture . The focus of this review is the identity of a possible translatable , functional Q96P88 in humans . The two possibilities considered are either that Q96P88 mRNA is expressed that encodes either 5 or 7 transmembrane domains or that a DB00644 II-responsive complex is formed by the DB00644 I receptor and fragments derived from the Q96P88 .
