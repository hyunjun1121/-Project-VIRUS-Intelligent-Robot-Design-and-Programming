Emerging small molecule drugs . Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases . Pharmacological lowering of LDL-C levels using statins reduces cardiovascular risk . However , a substantial residual risk persists especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Because of the inverse association observed in epidemiological studies of HDL-C with the risk for cardiovascular diseases , novel therapeutic strategies to raise HDL-C levels or improve HDL functionality are developed as complementary therapy for cardiovascular diseases . However , until now most therapies targeting HDL-C levels failed in clinical trials because of side effects or absence of clinical benefits . This chapter will highlight the emerging small molecules currently developed and tested in clinical trials to pharmacologically modulate HDL-C and functionality including new P11597 inhibitors ( anacetrapib , evacetrapib ) , novel Q07869 agonists ( K-877 , CER-002 , P15924 -8658 , INT131 and DB05187 ) , LXR agonists ( ATI-111 , LXR-623 , XL-652 ) and RVX-208 .
