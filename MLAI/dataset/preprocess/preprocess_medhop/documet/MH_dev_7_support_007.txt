Heart allograft protection with low-dose carbon monoxide inhalation : effects on inflammatory mediators and alloreactive T-cell responses . BACKGROUND : DB11588 ( CO ) , a byproduct of heme catalysis , has lately received considerable attention as a regulatory molecule in cellular and biological processes . CO has been shown to provide potent protection against a variety of tissue injuries . We hypothesized in this study that low concentration CO would be beneficial for organ allografts , which frequently undergo several types of injury such as ischemia/reperfusion , alloimmune reaction , and inflammation METHODS : The efficacy of low-dose CO was examined in a fully allogeneic LEW to BN rat heterotopic heart transplantation ( HHTx ) model . Recipients were kept in air or exposed to low-dose CO ( 20 ppm ) for 14 , 28 , or 100 days after HHTx under short-course tacrolimus RESULTS : CO treatment ( d0-28 , 0-100 ) was remarkably effective in prolonging heart allograft survival to a median of > 100 from 45 days in the air-control group , with significant reductions of arteritis , fibrosis , and cellular infiltration , including macrophages and T cells . CO inhibited intragraft upregulation of Th1 type cytokines ( P60568 , IFNgamma ) , proinflammatory mediators ( IL-1beta , TNFalpha , P05231 , P35354 ) , and adhesion molecule . Shorter CO exposure in early ( 0-13d ) and late ( 14-28d ) posttransplant periods also prolonged graft survival , with a significant inhibition of inflammatory mediators CONCLUSIONS : These results show that low dose CO inhalation protects heart allografts and can considerably prolong their survival . CO appears to function via multiple mechanisms , including direct inhibition of Th1 type cytokine production and regulation of inflammatory responses .
