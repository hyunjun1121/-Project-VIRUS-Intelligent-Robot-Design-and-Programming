Stimulation of cyclic AMP formation in the circular smooth muscle of human colon by activation of Q13639 -like receptors . 5-HT stimulated cyclic AMP generation in human colonic circular smooth muscle in a concentration-dependent fashion ( EC50 = 229.1 nM ) . DAU 6236 also increased cyclic AMP formation and was a partial agonist relative to 5-HT . GR 113808 inhibited the cyclic AMP formation induced by 5-HT with a -log Ki value of 9.1 and an apparent pA2 value of 9.2 . DB00904 and methysergide failed to inhibit cyclic AMP formation induced by 5-HT . These results indicate that the Q13639 receptors of human colonic circular muscle mediate relaxation and inhibition of spontaneous contractions via formation of cyclic AMP .
