DB00398 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma across geographic regions . DB00398 is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting Raf , P15692 receptor , PDGF receptor , c-kit , Flt-3 and rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) . Two randomized , placebo-controlled trials for Western and Asian patients , respectively , demonstrated that sorafenib significantly prolongs overall survival and time to progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . These have become the reference treatment for future clinical trials of advanced HCC . DB00398 is well tolerated in patients with Child-Pugh liver function class A , but limited data are available in Child-Pugh class B and C patients . Clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of sorafenib-based combination therapy and sorafenib adjuvant therapy for HCC .
