Interferon-alpha promotes the anti-proliferative effect of gefitinib ( DB00317 ) on human colon cancer cell lines . OBJECTIVE : Interferon-alpha ( IFN alpha ) treatment is associated with up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER 1/ P00533 ) expression and marked growth inhibition of colon cancer cell lines in vitro . We aimed to determine the effect of combining IFN alpha and gefitinib on colon cancer cell line growth . METHODS : A panel of nine colon cancer cell lines were characterised for expression of HER 1/ P00533 and then treated with gefitinib alone , or IFN alpha alone , or IFN alpha plus gefitinib , following a pre-treatment using vehicle or IFN alpha . Crystal violet staining and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation and expression of HER 1/ P00533 . The indexes and statistical assays were used to evaluate significant differences between treatment groups against vehicle control . RESULTS : All cell lines except SW 620 were HER 1/ P00533 positive . IFN alpha treatment was associated with significant up-regulation of cell surface HER 1/ P00533 expression in all HER 1/ P00533 -positive cell lines except KM 12 SM . Concurrent treatment with IFN alpha and gefitinib , or IFN alpha pre-treatment followed by gefitinib , or IFN alpha pre-treatment followed by a combination of IFN alpha plus gefitinib , additively or supra-additively/synergistically enhanced the sensitivity of the seven HER 1/ P00533 -up-regulated cell lines . CONCLUSION : IFN alpha improves the anti-proliferative effect of P00533 inhibition in colorectal cancer cell lines . This approach may have clinical implications for improving treatment based on targeting of HER 1/ P00533 .
