DB00082 in the treatment of acromegaly . Epidemiological studies have highlighted the need for tight control of growth hormone ( GH ) and insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) in patients with acromegaly . Studies highlighting the events involved in P10912 signaling have allowed the development of a pegylated P10912 antagonist ( pegvisomant ) for use in humans , which has been designed to outcompete GH for the P10912 , but which contains a position 120 amino acid substitution that prevents recruitment of a second P10912 . This process of receptor dimerisation is crucial for signal transduction and P05019 generation . Clinical trials of pegvisomant suggest it is the most effective treatment for acromegaly to date , as this therapy is capable of normalising serum P05019 in up to 97 % of patients when doses of 40 mg per day are used . This paper reviews the development of pegvisomant and the clinical experience in patients with acromegaly to date .
