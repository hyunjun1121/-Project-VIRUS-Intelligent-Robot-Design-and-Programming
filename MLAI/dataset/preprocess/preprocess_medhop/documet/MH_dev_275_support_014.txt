The v-ErbA oncoprotein quenches the activity of an erythroid-specific enhancer . v-ErbA is a mutated variant of thyroid hormone receptor ( TRalpha/ P10827 ) borne by the Avian Erythroblastosis virus causing erythroleukemia . TRalpha is known to activate transcription of specific genes in the presence of its cognate ligand , DB00279 hormone , while in its absence it represses it . v-ErbA is unable to bind ligand , and hence is thought to contribute to leukemogenesis by actively repressing erythroid-specific genes such as the carbonic anhydrase II gene ( CA II ) . In the prevailing model , v-ErbA occludes liganded TR from binding to its cognate elements and constitutively interacts with the corepressors NCoR/ Q9Y618 . We previously identified a v-ErbA responsive element ( VRE ) within a P24855 hypersensitive region ( Q5VYS8 ) located in the second intron of the CA II gene . We now show that Q5VYS8 fulfils all the requirements for a genuine enhancer that functions independent of its orientation and position with a profound erythroid-specific activity in normal erythroid progenitors ( T2ECs ) and in leukemic erythroid cell lines . We find that the Q5VYS8 enhancer activity is governed by two adjacent GATA-factor binding sites . v-ErbA as well as unliganded TR prevent Q5VYS8 activity by nullifying the positive function of factors bound to GATA-sites . However , v-ErbA , in contrast to TR , does not convey active repression to silence the transcriptional activity intrinsic to a heterologous tk promoter . We propose that depending on the sequence and context of the binding site , v-ErbA contributes to leukemogenesis by occluding liganded TR as well as unliganded TR thereby preventing activation or repression , respectively .
