P03372 -immunoreactive neurons contain calcitonin gene-related peptide , methionine-enkephalin or tyrosine hydroxylase in the female rat preoptic area . We have shown in our previous studies that estrogen treatment selectively influences calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) - , methionine-enkephalin ( DB00134 -Enk ) - and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -immunoreactive ( IR ) intensities in the neurons of the periventricular preoptic nucleus ( Q9H237 ) and the medial preoptic area ( DB00603 ) of the female rat . In the present study , we examined whether estrogen receptor ( ER ) -IR neurons in the Q9H237 and DB00603 contain P80511 , DB00134 -Enk , or TH using a double-labeling immunohistochemical method and investigated changes in the number of double-labeling cells upon treatment with estrogen . Brain sections of ovariectomized rats and ovariectomized and estrogen-treated rat were stained using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method followed by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method . The sections were first incubated with an anti-ER antibody in conjunction with nickel diaminobenzidine which produces a dark blue reaction product in the nucleus . Subsequently , P80511 , DB00134 -Enk or TH antisera were applied to these sections and the resulting brown diaminobenzidine reaction product in the cytoplasm was examined . Neurons that were double-labeled for ER and P80511 , DB00134 -Enk or TH were investigated in the Q9H237 and DB00603 . The number of doubly labeled ER/ P80511 - and ER/TH-IR neurons was large , whereas the number of ER/ DB00134 -Enk-IR neurons was small . These results suggest that ER in the Q9H237 and DB00603 may be more closely related to the mechanism of changes in P80511 - and TH-IR intensities upon estrogen treatment than that in DB00134 -Enk-IR intensity .
