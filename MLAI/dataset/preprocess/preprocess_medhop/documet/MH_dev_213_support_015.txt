Synthesis of hybrid transition-metalloproteins via thiol-selective covalent anchoring of Rh-phosphine and Ru-phenanthroline complexes . The preparation of hybrid transition metalloproteins by thiol-selective incorporation of organometallic rhodium- and ruthenium complexes is described . Phosphine ligands and two rhodium-diphosphine complexes bearing a carboxylic acid group were coupled to the cysteine of PYP R52G , yielding a metalloenzyme active in the rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation of dimethyl itaconate . The successful coupling was shown by (31)P NMR spectroscopy and P19957 mass spectroscopy . In addition wild-type PYP ( PYP WT ) , PYP R52G and P15090 were successfully modified with a ( eta(6)-arene ) ruthenium(II) phenanthroline complex via a maleimide linker .
