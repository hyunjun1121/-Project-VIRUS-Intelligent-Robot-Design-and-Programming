Characterization of lipid metabolism in insulin-sensitive adipocytes differentiated from immortalized human DB05914 . There is a great demand for cell models to study human adipocyte function . Here we describe the adipogenic differentiation of a telomerase-immortalized human mesenchymal stem cell line ( hMSC-Tert ) that maintains numerous features of terminally differentiated adipocytes even after prolonged withdrawal of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) agonist rosiglitazone . Differentiated hMSC-Tert developed the characteristic monolocular phenotype of mature adipocytes . The expression of adipocyte specific markers was highly increased during differentiation . Most importantly , the presence of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone was not required for the stable expression of lipoprotein lipase , adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and perilipin on mRNA and protein levels . Q15848 expression was post-transcriptionally down-regulated in the absence of rosiglitazone . P01308 sensitivity as measured by insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein was also independent of rosiglitazone . In addition to commonly used adipogenic markers , we investigated further PPARgamma-stimulated proteins with a role in lipid metabolism . We observed an increase of lipoprotein receptor ( P98155 , Q07954 ) and apolipoprotein E expression during differentiation . Despite this increased expression , the receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins was decreased in differentiated adipocytes , suggesting that these proteins may have an additional function in adipose tissue beyond lipoprotein uptake .
