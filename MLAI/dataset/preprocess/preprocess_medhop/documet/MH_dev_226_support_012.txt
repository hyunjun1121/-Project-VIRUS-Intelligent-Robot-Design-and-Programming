The silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors can interact with the aryl hydrocarbon ( Ah ) receptor but fails to repress P35869 -dependent gene expression . Exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) and related chemicals causes a variety of tissue- and species-specific biological and toxicological effects , most of which are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( P35869 ) . The P35869 complex is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to its specific DNA recognition site as a dimer with the P35869 nuclear translocator ( P27540 ) and activates gene transcription . Here , we have examined the ability of a nuclear corepressor , the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors ( Q9Y618 ) , to interact with and modulate P35869 -dependent gene expression . Using glutathione S-transferase ( Q86UG4 ) " pull-down " binding assays , we have mapped a major interaction between these factors to the silencing domain of Q9Y618 and the DB00233 B ligand binding domain of P35869 , and this interaction is unaffected by the addition of an P35869 ligand . Association of Q9Y618 with the P35869 : P27540 :DNA complex was not detected by Q86UG4 pull-down or gel retardation assays . Transient cotransfections of mammalian cells ( Hepa1c1c7 , MCF-7 , and BG-1 ) with Q9Y618 and a TCDD-inducible luciferase reporter containing the dioxin-responsive domain from the mouse P04798 regulatory region revealed that Q9Y618 does not repress , but enhances , P35869 signaling . However , when a reporter containing a human P04798 upstream region was cotransfected with Q9Y618 into human MCF-7 cells , P35869 -driven reporter activity was decreased by half , suggesting that Q9Y618 acts on the human P04798 promoter via a factor other than the P35869 in MCF-7 cells . Furthermore , the interaction between Q9Y618 and the P35869 may have implications in pathways other than the P35869 signaling pathway .
