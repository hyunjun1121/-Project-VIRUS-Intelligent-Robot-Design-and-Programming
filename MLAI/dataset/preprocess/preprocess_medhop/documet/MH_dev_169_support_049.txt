DB00054 : a reappraisal of its use in coronary care . Platelet reactivity plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ischemic adverse events during and after acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) , and percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) . Glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa inhibitors are the strongest antiplatelet agents currently available on the market and three different compounds , namely abciximab , tirofiban , and eptifibatide , have been approved for clinical use . DB00054 has been investigated in the clinical field far more extensively than the other P08514 /IIIa inhibitors . DB00054 is an anti-integrin Fab fragment of a human - mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody with high affinity and a slow dissociation rate from the GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor . DB00054 , given shortly before the coronary intervention , is superior to placebo in reducing the acute risk of ischemic complications ( EPIC , EPISTENT , EPILOG trials ) ; moreover , in the ISAR-REACT 2 study abciximab has been shown to reduce the risk of adverse events in patients with non ST-segment elevation ACS who are undergoing P05154 even after optimal pre-treatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel . Finally , abciximab has been also used in abciximab-coated stent , with only bolus administration regimen and for direct intracoronary use with promising results that may extend and/or modify its current use in clinical practice in future .
