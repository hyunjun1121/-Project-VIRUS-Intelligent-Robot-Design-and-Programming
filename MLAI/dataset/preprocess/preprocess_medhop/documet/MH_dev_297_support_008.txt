Q07869 gamma ligands , rosiglitazone and pioglitazone , inhibit P09038 - and P15692 -mediated angiogenesis . OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) agonists , pioglitazone and rosiglitazone , on vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) - and basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) -induced angiogenesis and on endothelial cell migration . METHODS : Chick chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) model was used to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on P15692 - and P09038 -induced angiogenesis . In addition , the effect of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on endothelial cell migration was evaluated using 8 mm pore filter to a feeder layer containing vitronectin as chemoattractant . RESULTS : Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone inhibited the pro-angiogenic effects of P09038 and P15692 in the P62158 model significantly ( P < 0.001 ) to the same extent . Endothelial cell migration was also inhibited by both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that Q07869 gamma ligands , pioglitazone and rosiglitazone , in addition to their important regulatory role in adipogenesis and inflammation , possess anti-angiogenic properties . Thus , Q07869 gamma ligands may be useful in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy , macular degeneration , and other ocular disorders and may lower the risk to develop cancer in diabetic patients .
