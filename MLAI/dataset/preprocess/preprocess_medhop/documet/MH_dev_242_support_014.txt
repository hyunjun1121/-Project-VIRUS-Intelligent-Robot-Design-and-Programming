Direct comparison of fluorescence- and bioluminescence-based resonance energy transfer methods for real-time monitoring of thrombin-catalysed proteolytic cleavage . In this study , a representative FRET system ( P27918 donor and YFP acceptor ) is compared with the BRET(2) system ( Renilla luciferase donor , green fluorescent protein(2) ( GFP(2) ) acceptor and coelenterazine 400a substrate ) . Cleavage of a thrombin-protease-sensitive peptide sequence inserted between the donor and acceptor proteins was detected by the P07949 signal . Complete cleavage by thrombin changed the BRET(2) signal by a factor of 28.9+/-0.2 ( R.S.D. ( relative standard deviation ) , n=3 ) and the FRET signal by a factor of 3.2+/-0.1 ( R.S.D. , n=3 ) . The BRET(2) technique was 50 times more sensitive than the FRET technique for monitoring thrombin concentrations . Detection limits ( blank signal+3sigma(b) , where sigma(b)=the standard deviation ( S.D. ) of the blank signal ) were calculated to be 3.05 and 0.22nM thrombin for FRET and BRET(2) , respectively . This direct comparison suggests that the BRET(2) technique is more suitable than FRET for use in proximity assays such as protease cleavage assays or protein-protein interaction assays .
