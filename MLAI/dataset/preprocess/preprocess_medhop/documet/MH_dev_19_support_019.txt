P04637 mutation , epithelial-mesenchymal transition , and stemlike features in breast cancer subtypes . Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties . We explored the association between P04637 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features . We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers . Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-β related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( P41134 , P47928 , P84022 , Q13485 , Q99717 , P37275 ) . These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of O43490 and P46531 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( P11802 , Q00534 , P46013 ) and migration ( P61073 , P03956 ) .
