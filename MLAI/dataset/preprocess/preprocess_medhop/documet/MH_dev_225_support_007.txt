Neutrophil apoptosis : selective regulation by different ligands of integrin alphaMbeta2 . Neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis , but their survival can be extended during inflammatory responses . alpha(M)beta(2) is reported either to delay or accelerate neutrophil apoptosis , but the mechanisms by which this integrin can support such diametrically opposed responses are poorly understood . The abilities of closely related alpha(M)beta(2) ligands , plasminogen and angiostatin , derived from plasminogen , as well as fibrinogen and its two derivative alpha(M)beta(2) recognition peptides , P1 and P2-C , differed markedly in their effects on neutrophil apoptosis . P00747 , fibrinogen , and P2-C suppressed apoptosis via activation of Akt and P27361 /2 kinases , while angiostatin and P1 failed to activate these prosurvival pathways and did not prevent neutrophil apoptosis . Using cells transfected with alpha(M)beta(2) or its individual alpha(M) or beta(2) subunits , and purified receptors and its constituent chains , we show that engagement of both subunits with prosurvival ligands is essential for induction of the prosurvival response . Hence , engagement of a single integrin by closely related ligands can induce distinct signaling pathways , which can elicit distinct cellular responses .
