Molecular mapping of uncharacteristically small 5q deletions in two patients with the 5q- syndrome : delineation of the critical region on 5q and identification of a 5q- breakpoint . Molecular mapping techniques have defined the region of gene loss in two patients with the 5q- syndrome and uncharacteristically small 5q deletions ( 5q31-q33 ) . The allelic loss of 10 genes localized to 5q23-qter ( centromere- P04141 - P18146 - P05230 -GRL- P07550 -CS F1R- P09486 - P42261 - P29459 - P35916 -telomere ) was investigated in peripheral blood cell fractions . Gene dosage experiments demonstrated that P04141 , P18146 , P29459 , and P35916 were retained on the 5q- chromosome in both patients and that P05230 was retained in one patient , thus placing these genes outside the critical region . GRL , P07550 , P07333 , P09486 , and P42261 were shown to be deleted in both patients . The proximal breakpoint is localized between P18146 and P05230 in one patient and between P05230 and P07550 in the other , and the distal breakpoint is localized between P42261 and P29459 in both patients . Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to map the 5q deletion breakpoints , and breakpoint-specific fragments were detected with P05230 in the granulocyte but not the lymphocyte fraction of one patient . This study has established the critical region of gene loss of the 5q- chromosome in the 5q- syndrome , giving the location for a putative tumor-suppressor gene in the 5.6-Mb region between P05230 and P29459 .
