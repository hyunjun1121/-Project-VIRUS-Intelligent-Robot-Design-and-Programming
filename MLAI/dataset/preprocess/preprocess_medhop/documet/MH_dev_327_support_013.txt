Analysis of dermatologic events in vemurafenib-treated patients with melanoma . BACKGROUND : DB08881 has been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced P15056 (V600E)-mutant melanoma . This report by the DB08881 Dermatology Working Group presents the characteristics of dermatologic adverse events ( AEs ) that occur in vemurafenib-treated patients , including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cuSCC ) . METHODS : Dermatologic AEs were assessed from three ongoing trials of P15056 (V600E) mutation-positive advanced melanoma . Histologic central review and genetic characterization were completed for a subset of cuSCC lesions . RESULTS : A total of 520 patients received vemurafenib . The most commonly reported AEs were dermatologic AEs , occurring in 92 % -95 % of patients . Rash was the most common AE ( 64 % -75 % of patients ) , and the most common types were rash not otherwise specified , erythema , maculopapular rash , and folliculitis . Rash development did not appear to correlate with tumor response . Photosensitivity occurred in 35 % -63 % of patients , and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( PPE ) occurred in 8 % -10 % of patients . The severity of rash , photosensitivity , and PPE were mainly grade 1 or 2 . In all , 19 % -26 % of patients developed cuSCC , mostly keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) . The majority of patients with cuSCC continued therapy without dose reduction after resection . Genetic analysis of 29 cuSCC/KA samples demonstrated P01112 mutations in 41 % . CONCLUSIONS : Dermatologic AEs associated with vemurafenib treatment in patients with melanoma were generally manageable with supportive care measures . Dose interruptions and/or reductions were required in < 10 % of patients .
