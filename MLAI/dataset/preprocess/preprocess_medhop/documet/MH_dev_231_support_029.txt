Molecular mechanisms of patupilone resistance . DB03010 is an epothilone in advanced clinical development that has shown promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients . This study aimed at characterizing the mechanisms of patupilone activity in resistant patients . To this end , we generated patupilone-resistant cells using two cellular models , the first characterized by high chemosensitivity and low class III beta-tubulin ( Q13509 ) expression ( A2780 ) , and the second by low chemosensitivity and high Q13509 expression ( OVCAR-3 ) . The obtained cell lines were named EPO3 and OVCAR-EPO , respectively . The same selection procedure was done in A2780 cells to generate a paclitaxel-resistant cell line ( TAX50 ) . Factors of resistance are expected to increase in the drug-resistant cell lines , whereas factors of drug sensitivity will be down-regulated . Using this approach , we found up-regulation of Q13509 in TAX50 , but not EPO3 , cells , showing that Q13509 mediates the resistance to paclitaxel but not to patupilone . Moreover , Q13509 was a factor of patupilone sensitivity because OVCAR-EPO cells exhibited a dramatic reduction of Q13509 and a concomitant sensitization to hypoxia and cisplatin-based chemotherapy . To identify the mechanisms underlying patupilone resistance , tubulin genes were sequenced , thereby revealing that a prominent mechanism of drug resistance is represented by point mutations in class I beta-tubulin . Overall , these results suggest that paclitaxel and patupilone have nonoverlapping mechanisms of resistance , thus allowing the use of patupilone for those patients relapsing after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy . Furthermore , patupilone represents a promising first-line option for the treatment of high-risk ovarian cancer patients , who exhibit high Q13509 levels and poor response to standard paclitaxel-platin chemotherapy .
