DB08896 for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors . INTRODUCTION : Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) are abdominal sarcomas which are extremely refractory to chemotherapy treatment . The treatment of GISTs has been revolutionized by use of P10721 /platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î± ( P16234 ) kinase inhibitors . Unfortunately , most tumors develop resistance to front-line ( imatinib ) or second-line ( sunitinib ) therapy . DB08896 , a P10721 / P16234 /vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) oral kinase inhibitor , has been shown to improve progression-free survival in the third- or fourth-line setting . AREAS COVERED : This review covers the preclinical and clinical studies of regorafenib for treatment of GIST . A literature search on regorafenib was carried out using the PubMed database up to October 2013 . EXPERT OPINION : Currently , imatinib and sunitinib represent the only proven first- and second-line therapies , respectively , for advanced GISTs . Based on the results of a Phase III study , regorafenib is now established as the only proven third-line therapy . DB08896 activity in this setting is believed to be due to its activity against oncogenic forms of P10721 / P16234 . Although side effects are common with this agent , they can be effectively managed with a combination of supportive care , dose interruptions/reductions . The toxicity profile is similar to other oral kinase inhibitors with anti-VEGFR activity . DB08896 is mainly metabolized by P08684 , and concomitant use of strong inducers/inhibitors of this enzyme should be avoided .
