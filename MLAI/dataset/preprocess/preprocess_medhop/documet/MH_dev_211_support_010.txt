Modulation of the folate receptor alpha gene by the estrogen receptor : mechanism and implications in tumor targeting . The folate receptor ( FR ) type alpha is a promising target for diagnostic imaging agents and therapeutic intervention in major subtypes of gynecological malignancies ; however , the receptor levels in the tumors are variable and are generally relatively low in estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive tumors . Here we report that the P15328 gene promoter is repressed in the presence of 17beta-estradiol and derepressed by the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182780 in a promoter-specific and P03372 -dependent manner in carcinoma cell lines including HeLa ( cervical carcinoma ) , BG-1 ( ovarian carcinoma ) , and IGROV-1 ( ovarian carcinoma ) . The ligand and ER dose response of the P15328 promoter and its time course paralleled those of a classical estrogen response element-mediated effect . Antiestrogens produced an ER-dependent increase of up to 36-fold in the expression of the endogenous P15328 gene . Deletion analysis and P15328 /SV40 promoter chimeras showed that the ER effect is mediated exclusively within the G/C-rich region in the TATA-less P4 promoter of P15328 ; electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated interaction of ER at only one of three G/C-rich elements . Q92731 only modestly affected P15328 promoter activity but did not diminish the P03372 -mediated effects . The ER corepressor , Q9Y618 , enhanced the repression by 17beta-estradiol/ER , but ER coactivators , including P12931 family members , did not appreciably impact the ER ligand response . The results suggest that in ER+ tumors , P15328 expression is directly and actively suppressed and predict that a brief treatment with antiestrogens will boost P15328 expression by passive derepression , enhancing the efficacy of FR-targeted diagnostic and therapeutic applications . They also reveal novel aspects of gene repression by ER .
