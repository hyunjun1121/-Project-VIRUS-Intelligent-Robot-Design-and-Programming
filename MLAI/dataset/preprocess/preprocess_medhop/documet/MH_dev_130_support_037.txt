DB00065 treatment of Familial Mediterranean fever and its effect on secondary AA amyloidosis . We describe a patient with a long history of familial Mediterranean fever who developed proteinuria as a result of secondary AA amyloidosis . In this patient , the inflammatory process , including recurrent attacks of arthritis , abdominal pain , nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis , and high sedimentation rate , was rapidly suppressed by treatment with infliximab and there was remarkable improvement of the proteinuria.Because P01375 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in FMF and secondary amyloid , it is an appropriate target for therapy . Our case is the first case of reactive systemic amyloidosis secondary to familial Mediterranean fever , which responded favorably to infliximab .
