P45984 phosphorylates endothelial nitric oxide synthase at serine 116 and regulates nitric oxide production . The c-Jun N-terminal kinases ( JNKs ) belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) superfamily play important roles in foam-cell formation , hypercholesterolemia-mediated endothelial dysfunction , and the development of obesity . Although decreased nitric oxide ( NO ) production via decreased phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase at serine 1179 ( P29474 - DB00133 (1179) ) was reported to be partly involved in P45984 -derived endothelial dysfunction , P45984 seems likely to be indirectly involved in this signaling pathway . Here , using bovine aortic endothelial cells , we examined whether P45984 directly phosphorylated P29474 - DB00133 (116) , a putative substrate site for the MAPK superfamily , and this phosphorylation resulted in decreased NO release . JNK inhibitor SP60012 increased NO release in a time- and dose-dependent manner , which was accompanied by increased P29474 - DB00133 (116) phosphorylation . Purified P45984 directly phosphorylated P29474 - DB00133 (116)in vitro . Ectopic expression of dominant negative P45984 repressed P29474 - DB00133 (116) phosphorylation and increased NO production . Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies revealed a colocalization of P29474 and P45984 . However , all these observed effects were not manifested when P45983 probes were used . Overall , this study indicates that P45984 is a physiological kinase responsible for P29474 - DB00133 (116) phosphorylation and regulates NO production .
