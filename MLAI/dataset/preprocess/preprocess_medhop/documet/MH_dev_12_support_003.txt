P61244 mutations status in Swedish patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours . Pheochromocytoma ( DB09058 ) and Paraganglioma are rare tumours originating from neuroendocrine cells . Up to 60 % of cases have either germline or somatic mutation in one of eleven described susceptibility loci , P31040 , P21912 , Q99643 , O14521 , Q9NX18 , P40337 , Q99814 , P07949 , P21359 , O75204 and MYC associated factor-X ( P61244 ) . Recently , germline mutations in P61244 were found to confer susceptibility to DB09058 and paraganglioma ( PGL ) . A subsequent multicentre study found about 1 % of PCCs and PGLs to have germline or somatic mutations in P61244 . However , there has been no study investigating the frequency of P61244 mutations in a Scandinavian cohort . We analysed tumour specimens from 63 patients with DB09058 and PGL treated at Uppsala University hospital , Sweden , for re-sequencing of P61244 using automated Sanger sequencing . Our results show that 0 % ( 0/63 ) of tumours had mutations in P61244 . Allele frequencies of known single nucleotide polymorphisms rs4902359 , rs45440292 , rs1957948 and rs1957949 corresponded to those available in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database . We conclude that P61244 mutations remain unusual events and targeted genetic screening should be considered after more common genetic events have been excluded .
