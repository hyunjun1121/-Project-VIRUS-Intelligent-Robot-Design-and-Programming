Tyrosine kinase blockers : new hope for successful cancer therapy . Tyrosine kinases ( TKs ) are attractive targets for cancer therapy , as quite often their abnormal signaling has been linked with tumor development and growth . Constitutive activated TKs stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for DNA repair , apoptosis , and cell proliferation . During the last few years , thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying tyrosine kinase 's activity led to novel cancer therapy using TKs blockers . These drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck , gastric , prostate and breast cancer and leukemias . The most successful example of kinase blockers is Imatinib ( Imatinib mesylate , Gleevec , STI571 ) , the inhibitor of Bcr/Abl oncoprotein , which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia . The introduction of STI571 for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed . Others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include Dasatinib ( BMS-354825 ) specific for P00519 non-receptor cytoplasmic kinase , Gefitinib ( DB00317 ) , Erlotinib ( DB00530 , Tarceva ) and DB01268 ( SU 11248 , Sutent ) specific for P15692 receptor kinase , AMN107 ( DB04868 ) and INNO-406 ( NS-187 ) specific for c- P10721 kinase . The following TK blockers for treatment of various human tumors are in clinical development : DB01259 ( DB01259 ditosylate , DB01259 , GW-572016 ) , Canertinib ( DB05424 ) , DB05294 ( DB05294 ) , DB04879 ( PTK787/ZK 222584 ) , DB00398 ( Bay 43-9006 , Nexavar ) , and Leflunomide ( SU101 , DB01097 ) . Herein , we discuss the chemistry , biological activity and clinical potential of new drugs with tyrosine kinase blockers for cancer treatment .
