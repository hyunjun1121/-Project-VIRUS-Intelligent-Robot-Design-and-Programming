Association of polymorphisms in P36888 , P00533 , P09917 , and Q8TAT5 with glioblastoma in the Han Chinese population . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the highest-grade glioma in astrocytoma . Patients often have poor prognosis due to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence . Identification of the genetic factors of GBM could be important contribution to early prevention of this disease . We genotyped 17 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( tSNPs ) from nine genes in this study , including 72 cases and 302 controls . SNP genotyping was conducted using Sequenom MassARRAY RS1000 . Statistical analysis of the association between tSNPs and GBM was performed using the χ ( 2 ) test and SNPStats software . The rs3829382 in P36888 was associated with increased odds of developing GBM using the χ ( 2 ) test . When we analyzed tSNPs under different inheritance models , we found rs9642393 in P00533 increased odds of developing GBM in the dominant model . After stratification by gender , we found that rs12645561 in Q8TAT5 and rs2291427 in P09917 were associated with developing GBM . Polymorphisms within P36888 , P00533 , Q8TAT5 , and P09917 may contribute to the occurrence of GBM in the Han Chinese population . However , the functional significance of these polymorphisms needs further investigation .
