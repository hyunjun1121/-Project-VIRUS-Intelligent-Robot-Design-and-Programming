Glutathione levels and Q07812 activation during apoptosis due to oxidative stress in cells expressing wild-type and mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator . Cystic fibrosis is characterized by chronic inflammation and an imbalance in the concentrations of alveolar and lung oxidants and antioxidants , which result in cell damage . Modifications in lung glutathione concentrations are recognized as a salient feature of inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis , and glutathione plays a major role in protection against oxidative stress and is important in modulation of apoptosis . The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is permeable to Cl(-) , larger organic ions , and reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione , and the DeltaF508 P13569 mutation found in cystic fibrosis patients has been correlated with impaired glutathione transport in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia . Because intracellular glutathione protects against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis , we studied the susceptibility of epithelial cells ( HeLa and IB3-1 ) expressing normal and mutant P13569 to apoptosis triggered by H(2)O(2) . We find that cells with normal P13569 are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis than cells expressing defective P13569 . In addition , sensitivity to apoptosis could be correlated with glutathione levels , because depletion of intracellular glutathione results in higher levels of apoptosis , and glutathione levels decreased faster in cells expressing normal P13569 than in cells with defective P13569 during incubation with H(2)O(2) . The pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member , Q07812 , is also activated faster in cells expressing normal P13569 than in those with mutant P13569 under these conditions , and artificial glutathione depletion increases the extent of Q07812 activation . These results suggest that glutathione-dependent Q07812 activation in cells with normal P13569 represents an early step in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of these cells .
