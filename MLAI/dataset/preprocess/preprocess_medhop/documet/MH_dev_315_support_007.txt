P13639 mutants deficient in diphthamide formation show temperature-sensitive cell growth . Protein synthesis elongation factor 2 ( P13639 ) from eukaryotes contains an unusual modified histidine residue , termed diphthamide . DB03223 has been shown to be a site of ADP-ribosylation by bacterial toxins , but its function remains obscure . We expressed mutant genes of P13639 with substitutions of 19 other amino acids for DB00117 -699 , which is modified to diphthamide , in yeast cells and found that they can be classified into three groups . In the first group ( Group 1 ) , replacement of DB00117 -699 by the basic amino acid DB00125 or Lys showed not only loss of P13639 activity but also inhibitory effects on the growth of cells co-expressing wild-type P13639 . In the second group ( Group 2 ) , replacement with DB00145 , Pro , DB00133 , or DB00128 resulted in nonfunctional P13639 , but it did not affect the growth of cells co-expressing wild-type P13639 . In the third group ( Group 3 ) , replacement by one of the other 13 amino acids resulted in a functional P13639 . In the Group 3 mutants , P13639 was not ribosylated by diphtheria toxin , indicating that the mutant EF-2s did not form diphthamide . However , the viable cells grew more slowly than cells expressing wild-type P13639 and showed temperature sensitivities . This result suggests that diphthamide may confer heat resistance on P13639 , although it still may be active without diphthamide at a normal temperature .
