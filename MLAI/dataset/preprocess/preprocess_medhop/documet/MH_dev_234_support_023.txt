The effects of 5-aza-2'- deoxycytidine and trichostatin A on gene expression and DNA methylation status in cloned bovine blastocysts . We previously found that treatment of both donor cells and early cloned embryos with combination of DB01262 ( 5-aza-dC ) and trichostatin A ( P32119 ) significantly improve the in vitro and full-term development of nuclear transfer ( NT ) bovine embryos . To investigate how this treatment improved the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei , we compared the expression levels of DNA methylation- , chromatin structure- , and development-related genes in in vitro fertilized ( IVF group ) , NT ( C-NT group ) , and 5-aza-dC and P32119 -treated NT ( T-NT group ) single blastocyst using quantitative real-time PCR . We also compared the DNA methylation status of satellite I among three groups using bisulfite sequencing analysis and combined bisulfite restriction analysis ( COBRA ) . There were significantly lower levels of P26358 , DNMT3b , Q92769 , and P01344 transcripts in T-NT blastocysts than in C-NT blastocysts , whereas the relative abundance of Q01860 and P48431 mRNA was significantly increased in T-NT blastocysts compared to C-NT blastocysts . In addition , the treatment also reduced the DNA methylation levels of NT blastocysts on satellite I sequence . It is likely that P32119 may act synergistically with 5-aza-dC to exert such modifications in gene expression and DNA methylation , subsequently enhancing developmental potential ( in vitro and full-term ) of treated cloned embryos .
