The role of the subthalamic nucleus in DB01235 induced dyskinesia in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats . DB01235 is the most effective treatment for Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , but prolonged use leads to disabling motor complications including dyskinesia . Strong evidence supports a role of the subthalamic nucleus ( Q05639 ) in the pathophysiology of PD whereas its role in dyskinesia is a matter of controversy . Here , we investigated the involvement of Q05639 in dyskinesia , using single-unit extracellular recording , behavioural and molecular approaches in hemi-parkinsonian rats rendered dyskinetic by chronic DB01235 administration . Our results show that chronic DB01235 treatment does not modify the abnormal Q05639 activity induced by the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway in this model . Likewise , we observed a loss of Q05639 responsiveness to a single DB01235 dose both in lesioned and sham animals that received daily DB01235 treatment . We did not find any correlation between the abnormal involuntary movement ( AIM ) scores and the electrophysiological parameters of Q05639 neurons recorded 24 h or 20-120 min after the last DB01235 injection , except for the axial subscores . Nonetheless , unilateral chemical ablation of the Q05639 with ibotenic acid resulted in a reduction in global AIM scores and peak-severity of dyskinesia . In addition , Q05639 lesion decreased the anti-dyskinetogenic effect of buspirone in a reciprocal manner . Striatal protein expression was altered in dyskinetic animals with increases in Î”FosB , phosphoDARPP-32 , dopamine receptor ( DR ) D3 and P14416 / P21728 ratio . The Q05639 lesion attenuated the striatal molecular changes and normalized the P14416 / P21728 ratio . Taken together , our results show that the Q05639 plays a role , if modest , in the physiopathology of dyskinesias .
