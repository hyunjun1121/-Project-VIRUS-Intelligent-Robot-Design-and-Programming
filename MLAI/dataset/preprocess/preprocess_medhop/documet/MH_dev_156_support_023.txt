On the multiplicity of platelet prostaglandin receptors . I . Evaluation of competitive antagonism by aggregometry . Methods for the evaluation of competitive interactions at receptors associated with platelet activation and inhibition using aggregometry of human PRP have been developed . The evidence supports the suggestion that PGE1 and DB01240 share a common receptor for inhibition of platelet reactivity , but only a portion ( if any ) of the aggregation stimulation associated with DB00917 is the result of DB00917 binding ( without efficacy ) to this receptor . DB00917 ( at .3-20 microM ) is an effective antagonist of PGE1 , DB01240 , and PGD2 producing a shift of about one order of magnitude in the IC50-values obtained from complete aggregation inhibition dose response curves . The antagonism of PGD2 inhibition is particularly notable , 80 nM DB00917 levels are detectable . This and other actions of DB00917 indicate another platelet receptor for DB00917 . PGE1 acts at both the DB00917 and P43119 . Other substances showing DB01240 -like actions only at high doses ( 1-30 microM ) , display additive responses with DB01240 indicative of decreased affinity for the I2/E1 receptor and the absence of DB00917 -like aggregation stimulation activity . DB01240 methyl ester has intrinsic inhibitory action not associated with in situ ester hydrolysis . The methyl ester is dissaggregatory showing particular specificity for inhibition of release and second wave aggregation .
