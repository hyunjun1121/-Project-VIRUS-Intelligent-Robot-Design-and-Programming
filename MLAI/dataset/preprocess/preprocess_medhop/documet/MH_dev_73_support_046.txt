[ Characteristics of abnormal behavior induced by delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in rats ] . delta 9- DB00470 ( THC ) , one of the active compounds of marihuana , is known to induce drug dependence and tolerance , and its action is weaker than those of other abused drugs in humans and animals . Acute effects of THC , " high " , " irritable " and " cognitive deficits " are more important than the drug dependence and tolerance . For this reason , we examined characteristics of abnormal behavior such as catalepsy-like immobilization , aggressive behavior including irritable aggression and muricide , and spatial cognition impairment induced by acute and chronic treatments of THC in rats . The catalepsy-like immobilization is related to a decrease in catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and amygdaloid nucleus and thus serves as a useful model for amotivational syndrome , one of cannabis psychoses . In aggressive behavior , muricide was determined by the housing condition . Muricide was induced if the rat was placed under an isolated housing condition within the period of the effect of single injection of THC . The behavioral change resembles exacerbation and flashback in humans . Spatial cognition is impaired by the interaction between cannabinoid ( P21554 ) and 5-HT2 receptor in the dorsal raphe-hippocampal serotonergic neurons . Thus the abnormal behavior induced by THC can be a useful model for investigating mental function in humans and new drugs for the treatment of mental disorders .
