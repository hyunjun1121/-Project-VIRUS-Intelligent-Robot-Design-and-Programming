MYC directs transcription of Q07820 and P06730 genes to control sensitivity of gastric cancer cells toward HDAC inhibitors . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) control fundamental physiological processes such as proliferation and differentiation . HDAC inhibitors ( HDACi ) induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells . Therefore , they represent promising cancer therapeutics that appear particularly useful in combination therapies . Although HDACi are tested in current clinical trials , the molecular mechanisms modulating the cellular responses toward HDACi are incompletely understood . To gain insight into pathways that limit HDACi efficacy in gastric cancer , we treated a panel of gastric cancer cells with the clinically relevant HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) . We report that higher expression levels of the anti-apoptotic P10415 family members Q07820 and BCL(XL) were detectable in cells with high inhibitory concentration 50 ( IC(50) ) values for DB02546 . Using RNAi , we show that Q07820 and BCL(XL) lower the efficacy of DB02546 . To find strategies to interfere with Q07820 and BCL(XL) expression , we investigated molecular regulation of both proteins . We show that specific siRNAs against c-MYC as well as pharmacological inhibition of this cancer-relevant transcription factor reduced Q07820 and BCL(XL) expression . Subsequently , we observed an increase in DB02546 efficacy . Our data furthermore demonstrate that two different molecular mechanisms are responsible for the modulation of these factors . Whereas c-MYC controls transcription of Q07820 directly , regulation of BCL(XL) was due to c-MYC 's capability to regulate the P06730 gene , which encodes a rate-limiting factor of eukaryotic translation . Our data reveal a new molecular mechanism for how c-MYC controls cell autonomous apoptosis and provide a rationale for a concerted inhibition of HDACs and c-MYC in gastric cancer .
