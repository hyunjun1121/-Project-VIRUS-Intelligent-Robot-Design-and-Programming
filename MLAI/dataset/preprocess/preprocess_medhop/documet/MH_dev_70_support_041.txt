In-vitro activity of atovaquone , sulphamethoxazole and dapsone alone and combined with inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and macrolides against Pneumocystis carinii . The anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity of atovaquone , dapsone and sulphamethoxazole alone and combined with dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitors and macrolides was investigated against five clinical isolates of P. carinii . The susceptibility tests were performed by inoculation of the organisms on to cell monolayer and parasite count after 72 h incubation at 37 degrees C . Culture plates were added to Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing serial dilutions of atovaquone , dapsone and sulphamethoxazole alone or in combination with diaveridine , pyrimethamine , trimethoprim , azithromycin , clarithromycin and roxithromycin . DB01117 , dapsone and sulphamethoxazole were found to be effective at levels well below the concentrations that could be achieved clinically , while P00374 inhibitors were shown to combine effectively with dapsone and sulphamethoxazole . No synergy could be demonstrated between atovaquone and P00374 inhibitors or macrolides . A mild synergic effect was noted when macrolides were combined with dapsone and sulphamethoxazole . DB00205 ( 0.5 mg/L ) combined with dapsone and trimethoprim ( 0.5 mg/L ) combined with sulphamethoxazole exerted the strongest inhibitory effect .
