Why your preferred targeted drugs may become unaffordable . DB00072 , a monoclonal antibody directed at the P04626 receptor , is one of the most impressive targeted drugs developed in the last two decades . Indeed , when given in conjunction with chemotherapy , it improves the survival of women with P04626 positive breast cancer , both in advanced and in early disease . Its optimal duration , however , is poorly defined in both settings with a significant economic impact in the adjuvant setting where the drug is arbitrarily given for 1 year . This article reviews current attempts at shortening this treatment duration , emphasizing the likelihood of inconclusive results and , therefore , the need to investigate this important variable as part of the initial pivotal trials and with the support of public health systems . Failure to do so has major consequences on treatment affordability . Ongoing adjuvant trials of dual P04626 blockade , using trastuzumab in combination with a second anti- P04626 agent , and trials of the antibody-drug conjugate DB05773 ( trastuzumab-emtansine ) have to all be designed with 12 months of targeted therapy .
