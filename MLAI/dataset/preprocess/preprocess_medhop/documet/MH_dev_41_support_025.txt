Class I HDACs are mediators of smoke carcinogen-induced stabilization of P26358 and serve as promising targets for chemoprevention of lung cancer . DNA methylation is an early event in bronchial carcinogenesis and increased DNA methyltransferase ( P26358 )1 protein expression is a crucial step in the oncogenic transformation of epithelia . Here , we investigate the role of class I histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) 1 to 3 in the stabilization of P26358 protein and as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer chemoprevention . Long-term exposure of immortalized bronchial epithelial cells ( HBEC-3KT ) to low doses of tobacco-related carcinogens led to oncogenic transformation , increased HDAC expression , cell-cycle independent increased P26358 stability , and DNA hypermethylation . Overexpression of HDACs was associated with increased P26358 stability and knockdown of HDACs reduced P26358 protein levels and induced P26358 acetylation . This suggests a causal relationship among increased class I HDACs levels , upregulation of P26358 protein , and subsequent promoter hypermethylation . Targeting of class I HDACs with valproic acid ( DB00313 ) was associated with reduced HDAC expression and a profound reduction of P26358 protein level . Treatment of transformed bronchial epithelial cells with DB00313 resulted in reduced colony formation , demethylation of the aberrantly methylated Q96HF1 promoter , and derepression of Q96HF1 transcription . These data suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity may reverse or prevent carcinogen-induced transformation . Finally , immunohistochemistry on human lung cancer specimens revealed a significant increase in P26358 , Q13547 , Q92769 , and O15379 expression , supporting our hypotheses that class I HDACs are mediators of P26358 stability . In summary , our study provides evidence for an important role of class I HDACs in controlling the stability of P26358 and suggests that HDAC inhibition could be an attractive approach for lung cancer chemoprevention .
