[ Inhibitive effect of troglitazone on TGF-beta(1) and fibronectin expression in human peritoneal mesothelial cells ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effect of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) agonist troglitazone on TGF-beta(1) and fibronectin ( Fn ) expression in human peritoneal mesothelial cells ( HPMCs ) . METHODS : HPMCs were cultured from human omentum by an enzyme digestion method , growing in medium containing 30 mmol/L D-glucose . TGF-beta(1) and Fn expression were measured in HPMCs in the presence and absence of 15 micromol/L troglitazone . The mRNA expressions of P37231 ,TGF-beta(1) and Fn were determined by semi-quantification reverse transcriptive PCR ( RT-PCR ) . The protein of TGF-beta(1) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and proteins of P37231 and Fn were determined by Western blot . RESULTS : The mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta(1) and Fn were significantly increased in HPMCs stimulated with 30 mmol/L D-glucose compared with the control group with P00748 media ( P < 0.01 ) . Obvious decrease of TGF-beta(1) was found in troglitazone ( 15 micromol/L ) treated group compared with group stimulated with 30 mmol/L D-glucose ( P < 0.05 ) . Exposure of HPMCs to troglitazone reduced the Fn secretion ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : DB00197 reduced the expression of TGF-beta(1) in HPMCs stimulated by 30mmol/L D-glucose , and reduced Fn production . P37231 agonists may have a specific role in ameliorating the course of progressive peritoneal fibrosis under long-term peritoneal dialysis states .
