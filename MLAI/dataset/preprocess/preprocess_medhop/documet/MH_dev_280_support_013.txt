Wild-type O75581 inhibits , whereas atherosclerosis-linked LRP6R611C increases PDGF-dependent vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation . Vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) proliferation is an important event in atherosclerosis and other vasculopathies . PDGF signaling is a key mediator of SMC proliferation , but the mechanisms that control its activity remain unclear . We previously identified a mutation in P01130 -related protein 6 ( O75581 ) , O75581 (R611C) , that causes early atherosclerosis . Examination of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries showed markedly increased expression of O75581 and colocalization with PDGF receptor β ( P09619 -β ) . Further investigation showed that wild-type O75581 inhibits but O75581 (R611C) promotes VSMC proliferation in response to PDGF . We found that wild-type O75581 forms a complex with P09619 -β and enhances its lysosomal degradation , functions that are severely impaired in O75581 (R611C) . Further , we observed that wild-type and mutant O75581 regulate cell-cycle activity by triggering differential effects on PDGF-dependent pathways . These findings implicate O75581 as a critical modulator of PDGF-dependent regulation of cell cycle in smooth muscle and indicate that loss of this function contributes to development of early atherosclerosis in humans .
