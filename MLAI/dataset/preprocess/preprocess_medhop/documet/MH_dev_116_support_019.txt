[ Functional analysis of the alpha1G subunit of the T-type calcium channel in cellular proliferation ] . Increases of functional T-type calcium channel ( T-channel ) expression have been associated with cellular proliferation although evidence for this remains controversial . In the present study , we have used a variety of cellular , molecular and electrophysiological techniques to test the hypothesis that T-type channels play a causal role in the signaling pathway leading to proliferation . The results showed that stable over-expression of alpha1G T-channel subunit in P29320 -293 cells conferred a significant growth advantage . Thus , cell population doubling time was reduced to 13.7 +/- 0.3 h in alpha1G transfectants , compared to control cultures ( 22.1 +/- 1.1 h ) and flow cytometry analysis showed that this was due to a reduction in the number of alpha1G transfectants residing in the G0/ P55008 phases of the cell cycle compared to controls . The selective T-type calcium channel blocker , mibefradil , induced a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in alpha1G tansfectants . Furthermore , the Western blotting results proved that the level of protein expression of P24941 , cyclin A and cyclin E was high in alpha1G transfectants compared to control cultures . Our results demonstrate that the T-type calcium channel provides a significant growth advantage to P29320 -293 cells that might occur via effects on the P55008 /S cell cycle mechanism .
