Mobilization of Ph chromosome-negative peripheral blood stem cells in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients with imatinib mesylate-induced complete cytogenetic remission . Imatinib mesylate ( IM , DB00619 , Glivec ) can induce a high rate of complete cytogenetic response ( CCR ) in chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) patients , although to date the majority of patients continue to have detectable disease by sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . It is therefore possible that these patients may ultimately relapse and require treatment such as autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( APBSCT ) . We attempted mobilization of haemopoietic progenitor cells from 58 patients in CCR using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [ rHu- DB00099 ; 10 micro g/kg/d subcutaneously ( s.c. ) for at least 4 d ] alone , while continuing IM treatment . The median d 5 ( peak ) P28906 + count was 11.5/ microl ( range 0-108/ microl ) , and 43/58 ( 74 % ) patients underwent a median of two ( range 1-3 ) apheresis procedures . A median dose of 2.1 x 10(6)/kg P28906 + cells ( range 0.1-6.5 x 10(6)/kg ) was collected . Some 84 % of 31 collections analysed were negative for the Philadelphia ( Ph ) chromosome or breakpoint cluster region and Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue ( P11274 - P00519 ) translocation by cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization respectively . No toxicity was reported with the regimen . Overall , the target P28906 + dose ( 2 x 10(6)/kg P28906 + ) was attained in 23/58 ( 40 % ) patients who entered the study . In summary , we have demonstrated that successful mobilization of Ph- P28906 + cells from IM-treated patients in CCR is possible using rHu-G- P04141 alone .
