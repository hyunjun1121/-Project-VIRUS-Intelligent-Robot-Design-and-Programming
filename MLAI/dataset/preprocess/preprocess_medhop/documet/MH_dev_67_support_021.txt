The role of MAPK and Nrf2 pathways in ketanserin-elicited attenuation of cigarette smoke-induced P10145 production in human bronchial epithelial cells . Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) with chronic airway inflammation as a key feature . Blockade of serotonin receptor 2A ( 5-HTR(2A) ) with ketanserin has been found to improve lung function in P48444 patients . Furthermore , ketanserin has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties in vivo . In this study , we investigated the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of ketanserin and its underlying mechanism of action on cigarette smoke-induced interleukin ( IL ) -8 release in vitro . Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells and human bronchial epithelial cell line ( BEAS-2B ) were treated with or without ketanserin prior to exposure to cigarette smoke medium ( CSM ) . Exposure to CSM caused elevation of both mRNA and release of P10145 with increased phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) . Consistently , CSM-induced P10145 release was blocked by SB203580 , U0126 , or Q02750 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) but not SP600125 . On the other hand , CSM caused a dose-dependent decrease in the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ( rGSH/GSSG ) together with an increased translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus demonstrated by Western blot analysis . Knock down of Nrf2 by siRNA completely blocked CSM-induced P10145 release . Ketanserin suppressed CSM-induced P10145 release by inhibiting p38 , P27361 /2 MAPK , and Nrf2 signaling pathways and partially inhibited CSM-induced reduction of rGSH/GSSG ratio . Our data demonstrated the novel antioxidative and anti-inflammatory role of ketanserin via the Nrf2 signaling pathway in CSM-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells . This may open up new perspectives in the development of novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of cigarette smoke-related P48444 .
