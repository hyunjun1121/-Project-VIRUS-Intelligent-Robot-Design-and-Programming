Activity of the rat P48058 promoter in transfected cortical neurons and glia . AMPA ( alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate ) receptors are assembled from four subunits , GluR1-4 . Although P48058 is widely expressed in brain its abundance is less than GluR1-3 . We have isolated approximately 5 kb of the rat P48058 promoter region and analyzed its capacity to drive expression of a luciferase reporter gene in transfected rat cortical neurons and glia , and P13671 glioma cells . Multiple transcriptional start sites were identified in a GC-rich region lacking TATA-boxes between -1090 and -1011 bp from ATG . In transfected mixed cortical cultures , luciferase expression driven by P48058 promoter segments were found predominantly in TuJ1-positive neurons , indicating neuronal preference of P48058 . The P48058 promoter fragments were 6-12-fold more active in neurons than glia , compared with a 30-fold neuronal selectivity of GluR2 . Deletion of the P48058 transcriptional initiation region decreased luciferase activity in neurons , but increased activity in P13671 cells , suggesting that regulatory elements governing neuronal expression reside in this region . An intron within the 5'-untranslated region and Sp1 , IK2 and E-box sites are conserved in the rat , mouse and human P48058 promoters . The relative activity of P48058 and GluR2 promoters in transfected cells correlates with their expression in brain , and in both promoters regulatory elements for neuronal expression reside near the initiation sites .
