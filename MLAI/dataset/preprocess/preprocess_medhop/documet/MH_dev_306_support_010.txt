P43490 / P43490 /visfatin and cancer . P43490 / P43490 /visfatin is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first step in NAD biosynthesis from nicotinamide and regulates growth , apoptosis and angiogenesis of mammalian cells . This enzyme was originally cloned as a putative cytokine shown to enhance the B cell precursor maturation in the presence of P13232 and stem cell factor . A number of cancers have increased expression of P43490 / P43490 /visfatin , which regulates a variety of different signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt , P27361 /2 and P40763 . FK866/APO866 and CHS828/ DB05217 are two known inhibitors of P43490 / P43490 /visfatin and have been evaluated as anticancer agents in the clinic . This review will focus on its role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression and its inhibitors as therapeutic target for cancer treatment .
