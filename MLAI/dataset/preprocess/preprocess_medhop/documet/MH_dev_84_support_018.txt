MEK/ P29323 -dependent Q03405 expression is required for motility via phosphorylation of P70S6K in human hepatocarcinoma cells . Motility and invasiveness events require specific intracellular signaling cascade activations . In cancer liver cells , one of these mechanisms could involve the MAPK MEK/ P29323 cascade activation which has been shown over expressed and activated in hepatocellular carcinoma . To study whether the MEK/ P29323 cascade is involved in the motility of HCC , we examined the effect of MEK inhibitor and P28482 silencing using monolayer wound-healing assays and fluoroblock invasion systems . Evidence was provided that the MAPK cascade is a key transduction pathway which controls HCC cells motility and invasiveness . We could disconnect proliferation to motility using mitomycin C and we established that RNAi-mediated inhibition of P28482 led to strongly reduced cell motility . To improve our understanding , we analysed the regulation and the role of urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) in this process . We provided evidence that Q03405 was under a MEK/ P29323 dependent mechanism and blocking Q03405 activity using specific antagonist or inhibiting its expression by RNA interference which resulted in complete inhibition of motility . Moreover , we found in MAPK inhibited cultures and in Q03405 silencing cells that p70S6K phosphorylation on residue DB00156 -389 was significantly reduced , whereas DB00133 -421/ DB00156 -424 phosphorylation did not change . We highlighted that the P42345 / P42345 pathway did not affect motility and DB00156 -389 phosphorylation . Furthermore , we demonstrated that p70S6K inhibition by RNA interference completely inhibited hepatocarcinoma cell motility . Therefore , targeting Q03405 and/or MEK/ P29323 /S6K by RNA interference could be a major therapeutic strategy for the future treatment of invasive hepatocarcinoma cells .
