Autophagy is induced through the ROS- P04637 - Q8N682 pathway in response to mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition . Mitoribosome in mammalian cells is responsible for synthesis of 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins , which are integral parts of four mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes ( I , III , IV and V ) . O75616 is a nuclear-encoded GTPase important for the formation of the 28S small mitoribosomal subunit . Here , we demonstrate that knockdown of O75616 by RNA interference inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis and promotes reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , leading to autophagic vacuolization in HeLa cells . Cells that lack O75616 expression showed a significant conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and an enhanced accumulation of autophagic vacuoles carrying the LC3 marker , all of which were blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA as well as by the ROS scavenger Q9C000 . Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis either by O75616 siRNA or chloramphenicol ( CAP ) , a specific inhibitor of mitoribosomes , induced autophagy in HTC-116 P04637 ( +/+ ) cells , but not in HTC-116 P04637 ( -/- ) cells , indicating that tumor protein 53 ( P04637 ) is essential for the autophagy induction . The ROS elevation resulting from mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition induced P04637 expression at transcriptional levels by enhancing P04637 promoter activity , and increased P04637 protein stability by suppressing P04637 ubiquitination through Q16539 /p38 MAPK-mediated P04637 phosphorylation . Upregulation of P04637 and its downstream target gene Q8N682 , but not P38936 / P38936 , was required for the autophagy induction in O75616 siRNA or CAP-treated cells . Altogether , these data indicate that autophagy is induced through the ROS- P04637 - Q8N682 pathway in response to mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition .
