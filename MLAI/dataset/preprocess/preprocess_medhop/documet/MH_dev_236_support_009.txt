Identification of a variant in P35968 associated with serum P35968 and pharmacodynamics of DB06589 . PURPOSE : P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) kinases are important drug targets in oncology that affect function of systemic endothelial cells . To discover genetic markers that affect VEGFR inhibitor pharmacodynamics , we performed a genome-wide association study of serum soluble vascular P35968 concentrations [ sVEGFR2 ] , a pharmacodynamic biomarker for P35968 inhibitors . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We conducted a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of [ sVEGFR2 ] in 736 healthy Old Order Amish volunteers . Gene variants identified from the GWAS were genotyped serially in a cohort of 128 patients with advanced solid tumor with baseline [ sVEGFR2 ] measurements , and in 121 patients with renal carcinoma with [ sVEGFR2 ] measured before and during pazopanib therapy . RESULTS : rs34231037 ( C482R ) in P35968 , the gene encoding sVEGFR2 was found to be highly associated with [ sVEGFR2 ] , explaining 23 % of the variance ( P = 2.7 Ã— 10(-37) ) . Association of rs34231037 with [ sVEGFR2 ] was replicated in 128 patients with cancer with comparable effect size ( P = 0.025 ) . Furthermore , rs34231037 was a significant predictor of changes in [ sVEGFR2 ] in response to pazopanib ( P = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that genome-wide analysis of phenotypes in healthy populations can expedite identification of candidate pharmacogenetic markers . Genotyping for germline variants in P35968 may have clinical utility in identifying patients with cancer with unusual sensitivity to effects of P35968 kinase inhibitors .
