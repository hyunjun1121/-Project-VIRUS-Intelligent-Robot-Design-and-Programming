The farnesoid X receptor induces very low density lipoprotein receptor gene expression . The farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) is a nuclear receptor activated by bile acids ( BAs ) . In response to ligand-binding , Q96RI1 regulates many genes involved in BA , lipid , and lipoprotein metabolism . To identify new Q96RI1 target genes , microarray technology was used to profile total RNA extracted from HepG2 cells treated with the natural Q96RI1 agonist chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) . Interestingly , a significant increase of transcript level of the very low density lipoprotein receptor ( P98155 ) was observed . Our data , resulting from selective Q96RI1 activation , Q96RI1 RNA silencing and Q96RI1 -deficient mice , clearly demonstrate that BAs up-regulate P98155 transcript levels via a Q96RI1 -dependent mechanism in vitro in human and in vivo in mouse liver cells .
