DB00207 fails to reduce inflammation in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells . Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator ( P13569 ) gene that encodes a chloride ( Cl(-) ) channel . Cystic fibrosis pulmonary pathophysiology is characterised by chronic inflammation and bacterial infections . DB00207 , a macrolide antibiotic , has shown promising anti-inflammatory properties in some inflammatory pulmonary diseases . Moreover , all clinical studies have presented an improvement of the respiratory condition of cystic fibrosis patients , but the molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unknown . The aim of this study was to investigate , in bronchial epithelial cells , the effects of azithromycin on inflammatory pathways involved in cystic fibrosis . We have analysed the effects of azithromycin on cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell lines but also in non-immortalized non-cystic fibrosis human glandular cells . To create an inflammatory context , cells were treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor ( P01375 ) -α or Interleukin (IL)1-β . Activation of the NF-κB pathway was investigated by luciferase assay , western blotting , and by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer imaging , allowing the detection of the interaction between the transcription factor and its inhibitor in live cells . In all conditions tested , azithromycin did not have an anti-inflammatory effect on the cystic fibrosis human bronchial epithelial cells and on P13569 -inhibited primary human bronchial glandular cells . More , our data showed no effect of azithromycin on IL-1β- or P01375 -α-induced P10145 secretion and NF-κB pathway activation . Taken together , these data show that azithromycin is unable to decrease in vitro inflammation in cystic fibrosis cells from airways .
