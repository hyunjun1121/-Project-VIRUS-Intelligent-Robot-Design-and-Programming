Coadministration of P55089 -01 with Q02750 /2 inhibitors potently induces apoptosis in P11274 / P00519 + leukemia cells sensitive and resistant to ST1571 . Interactions between the PKC and Chk1 inhibitor P55089 -01 and pharmacologic Q02750 /2 inhibitors ( e.g. , U0126 , PD184352 ) were examined in Bcr/Abl(+) = human leukemia cells ( K562 , P25391 84 ) sensitive and resistant to the Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 . Coexposure of K562 cells to P55089 -01 ( e.g. , 100 nM ) or U0126 ( 30 microM ) resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury ( e.g. , release of cytochrome c ; loss of deltapsi(m) ) and apoptosis . Similar results were obtained in other Bcr/Abl(+) cells ( e.g. , P25391 84 , BV-173 ) and with other Q02750 /2 inhibitors ( e.g. , PD184352 ) . Exposure of K562 cells to P55089 -01 resulted in activation of P29323 , an effect that was abrogated by co-administration of Q02750 /2 inhibitors . Coadminstration of P55089 -01 with U0126 produced multiple perturbations in signal transduction/cell cycle regulatory pathways , including diminished expression of Bcr/Abl , Mcl-1 , cylin D(1) , and activation of JNK and p34(cdc2) . Coadministration of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated P55089 -01/MEK inhibitor- associated lethality , suggesting a functional role for JNK activation in enhanced lethality . Finally , P55089 -01 and Q02750 /2 inhibitors effectively induced apoptosis in Bcr/Abl(+) cells ( e.g. , K562 and P25391 84 ) overexpressing Bcr/Abl and resistant to STI571 . These findings indicate that BcrAbl(+) leukemia cells are sensitive to a strategy combining P55089 -01 with MEK/ P29323 inhibitors that simultaneously disrupts two signaling pathways .
