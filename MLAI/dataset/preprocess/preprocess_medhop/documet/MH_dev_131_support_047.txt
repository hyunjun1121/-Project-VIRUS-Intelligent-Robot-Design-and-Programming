DB00502 induces neurotoxicity by the DB01221 receptor downstream signaling pathway , alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity . The DB01221 receptor is believed to be important in a wide range of nervous system functions including neuronal migration , synapse formation , learning and memory . In addition , it is involved in excitotoxic neuronal cell death that occurs in a variety of acute and chronic neurological disorders . Besides of agonist/coagonist sites , other modulator sites , including butyrophenone site may regulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor . It has been shown that haloperidol , an antipsychotic neuroleptic drug , interacts with the Q13224 subunit of DB01221 receptor and inhibits DB01221 response in neuronal cells . We found that DB01221 receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Ras antibody and this complex , beside NR2 subunit of DB01221 receptor contained haloperidol-binding proteins , P29475 and Ras- P01286 . Furthermore , we have shown that haloperidol induces neurotoxicity of neuronal cells via DB01221 receptor complex , accompanied by dissociation of Ras- P01286 from membranes and activation of c-Jun-kinase . Inclusion of insulin prevented relocalization of Ras- P01286 and subsequent neuronal death . DB00502 -induced dissociation of Ras- P01286 leads to inhibition of membrane-bound form of Ras protein and changes downstream regulators activity that results in the initiation of the apoptotic processes via the mitochondrial way . Our results suggest that haloperidol induces neuronal cell death by the interaction with DB01221 receptor , but through the alternative from glutamate excitotoxicity signaling pathway .
