Effects of siltuximab on the P05231 -induced signaling pathway in ovarian cancer . PURPOSE : To explore potential therapeutic strategies for interrupting the interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) signaling pathway , we measured P05231 expression in ovarian cancer tissues , and evaluated the effects of a monoclonal anti- P05231 antibody ; siltuximab ( CNTO 328 ) , on levels of P05231 -induced Stat3 phosphorylation , Stat3 nuclear translocation , and Stat3 downstream antiapoptotic genes . We then looked for enhancing paclitaxel sensitivity in multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Expressions of P05231 in ovarian cancer patient specimens were assessed by immunohistochemistry . Effects of siltuximab on P05231 -induced activation of Stat3 in an ovarian cancer cell line were determined by Western blot and real-time analysis of Stat3 nucleocytoplasmic translocation . Influence of combination of siltuximab and paclitaxel on tumor growth was evaluated in a xenograft mouse mode in vivo . RESULTS : Metastatic and drug-resistant recurrent tumors have significantly higher P05231 expression when compared with the matched primary tumors . DB09036 specifically suppressed P05231 -induced Stat3 phosphorylation and Stat3 nuclear translocation . Treatment with siltuximab significantly decreased the levels of Stat3 downstream proteins such as Q8WXI8 -1 , Bcl-X(L) , and survivin . Treatment with siltuximab reduced expression of multiple P05231 -induced genes in these cell lines . Furthermore , siltuximab increased the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in a paclitaxel resistant ovarian cancer cell line in vitro , but combination therapy with siltuximab did not have a significant effect on paclitaxel resistant tumor growth in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : These results show that siltuximab effectively block the P05231 signaling pathways and P05231 -induced gene expression . Blockage of P05231 signaling may provide benefits for the treatment of ovarian cancer .
