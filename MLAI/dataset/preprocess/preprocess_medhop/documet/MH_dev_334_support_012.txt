Pannexin 1 channels link chemoattractant receptor signaling to local excitation and global inhibition responses at the front and back of polarized neutrophils . Neutrophil chemotaxis requires excitatory signals at the front and inhibitory signals at the back of cells , which regulate cell migration in a chemotactic gradient field . We have previously shown that DB00171 release via pannexin 1 ( Q96RD7 ) channels and autocrine stimulation of P41231 receptors contribute to the excitatory signals at the front . Here we show that Q96RD7 also contributes to the inhibitory signals at the back , namely by providing the ligand for A2A adenosine receptors . In resting neutrophils , we found that A2A receptors are uniformly distributed across the cell surface . In polarized cells , A2A receptors redistributed to the back where their stimulation triggered intracellular DB02527 accumulation and protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation , which blocked chemoattractant receptor signaling . Inhibition of Q96RD7 blocked A2A receptor stimulation and DB02527 accumulation in response to formyl peptide receptor stimulation . Treatments that blocked endogenous A2A receptor signaling impaired the polarization and migration of neutrophils in a chemotactic gradient field and resulted in enhanced P29323 and p38 MAPK signaling in response to formyl peptide receptor stimulation . These findings suggest that chemoattractant receptors require Q96RD7 to trigger excitatory and inhibitory signals that synergize to fine-tune chemotactic responses at the front and back of neutrophils . Q96RD7 channels thus link local excitatory signals to the global inhibitory signals that orchestrate chemotaxis of neutrophils in gradient fields .
