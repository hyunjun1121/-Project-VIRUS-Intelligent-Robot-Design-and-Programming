Exposure to an organophosphate ( DB00677 ) during a defined period in neonatal life induces permanent changes in brain muscarinic receptors and behaviour in adult mice . The organophosphate DB00677 ( DB00677 ) is a well-known inhibitor of cholinesterases . We have recently observed that neonatal exposure to a single subsymptomal dose of DB00677 induces permanent alterations in muscarinic cholinergic receptors ( MAChRs ) and in spontaneous behaviour , in the mice as adults . In order to determine if there is a critical period for these effects , neonatal mice were given a single oral dose of 1.5 mg/kg DB00677 b.wt. on postnatal day 3 , 10 or 19 , causing equal inhibition of P22303 . At the adult age of 4 months the mice were tested for spontaneous motor behaviour , and were subsequently sacrificed for measurement of density of MAChRs and subpopulations of MAChRs in the cerebral cortex by using the antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [3H]QNB ) , and agonist carbachol , respectively . At adult age , mice exposed to DB00677 on postnatal day ( P01160 ) 3 or 10 showed significant ( P < or = 0.01 ) alterations in spontaneous motor behaviour and a significant ( P < or = 0.01 ) decrease in muscarinic receptor density . There were no alterations mice exposed on P01160 19 . The proportions and affinity-constants of high- and low-affinity MAChR binding sites were not affected in mice showing altered MAChR density . The lack of effect on mice exposed on P01160 19 was not due to differences in P22303 activity .
