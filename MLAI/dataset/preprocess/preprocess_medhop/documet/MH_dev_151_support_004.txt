β-Secretase ( P56817 ) inhibition causes retinal pathology by vascular dysregulation and accumulation of age pigment . β-Secretase ( P56817 ) is a major drug target for combating Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Here we show that P56817 (-/-) mice develop significant retinal pathology including retinal thinning , apoptosis , reduced retinal vascular density and an increase in the age pigment , lipofuscin . P56817 expression is highest in the neural retina while Q9Y5Z0 was greatest in the retinal pigment epithelium ( Q96AT9 ) /choroid . Pigment epithelial-derived factor , a known regulator of γ-secretase , inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -induced in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and this is abolished by P56817 inhibition . Moreover , intravitreal administration of P56817 inhibitor or P56817 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) increases choroidal neovascularization in mice . P56817 induces ectodomain shedding of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( P17948 ) which is a prerequisite for γ-secretase release of a 100 kDa intracellular domain . The increase in lipofuscin following P56817 inhibition and RNAI knockdown is associated with lysosomal perturbations . Taken together , our data show that P56817 plays a critical role in retinal homeostasis and that the use of P56817 inhibitors for AD should be viewed with extreme caution as they could lead to retinal pathology and exacerbate conditions such as age-related macular degeneration .
