Establishment of a double Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived cell line , TMD5 : effects of cytokines and differentiation inducers on growth of the cells . A double Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) -positive leukemia cell line with common-B cell phenotype , designated TMD5 , was established from the blast cells of a patient with double Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia . TMD5 cells expressed 190 kDa P11274 / P00519 chimeric protein and 145 kDa P00519 protein . The cells proliferated without added growth factors . Autocrine growth mechanism was not recognized . The addition of growth factors such as DB00099 , GM- P04141 , P08700 , P05231 , or Stem Cell Factor did not affect the growth . Herbimycin A suppressed the growth of TMD5 cells at the low concentration that did not affect Ph-negative cells . It suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins in TMD5 cells . Dexamethasone and dibutyryl cyclic AMP also suppressed the growth . They , however , did not affect the phosphorylation significantly . Neither all-trans retinoic acid nor interferon-alpha affected the growth . TMD5 cells , characterized minutely here and rare in that they have double Ph chromosomes , will be a useful tool for the study of Ph-positive leukemia .
