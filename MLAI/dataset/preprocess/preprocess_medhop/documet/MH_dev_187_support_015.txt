Increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 with fibrin deposition in a murine model of aging , " Q9UEF7 " mouse . Although aging accompanies specific pathological changes , including thrombosis and organ sclerosis , the underlying mechanisms of these processes remain to be elucidated . In the present study , we analyzed the gene expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , a key molecule in the development of thrombosis , in a murine model of aging , klotho mutant ( kl/kl ) mice . Active P05121 antigen in plasma and P05121 mRNA in several tissues were strikingly elevated in kl/kl mice as compared with wild-type mice . This increased P05121 expression was age dependent and linked to the development of ectopic calcification and glomerular fibrin deposition in the kidneys . In situ hybridization analysis of kl/kl mice demonstrated that strong signals for P05121 mRNA were localized in renal tubular epithelial cells , cardiomyocytes , adrenal medullar cells , and smooth muscle and endothelial cells in MÃ¶nckeberg 's arteriosclerotic vessels . Renal glomerular fibrin deposition , as evaluated immunohistochemically , was occasionally observed only in kl/kl mice , and the number of fibrin-positive glomeruli increased as the kl/kl mice aged . These observations suggest that in the process of aging the P05121 gene expression is increased , contributing to the development of thrombosis .
