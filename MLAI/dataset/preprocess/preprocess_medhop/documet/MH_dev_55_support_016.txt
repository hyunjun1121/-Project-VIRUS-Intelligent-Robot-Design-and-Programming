Regulation of protein turnover by L-glutamine in porcine intestinal epithelial cells . L-Glutamine ( Gln ) plays an important role in sustaining the intestinal mucosal mass of humans and animals . However , the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown . This study tested the hypothesis that Gln regulates protein turnover in intestinal epithelial cells . Intestinal porcine epithelial cells ( IPEC-1 ) were cultured for 3 h ( short-term study ) or 96 h ( long-term study ) in Gln-free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle- P00748 Ham medium containing 0 , 0.5 or 2.0 mM Gln . To determine effects of ammonia ( a metabolite of Gln , i.e. , 0.18 mM ammonia produced from 2 mM Gln in 3 h ) on protein turnover , additional experiments were conducted in which medium contained 0.5 mM Gln and 0 , 0.2 , 0.5 or 2.0 mM NH(4)Cl . Variables of analysis included cell growth , protein synthesis , proteolysis and mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) signaling . IPEC-1 cell growth increased with extracellular Gln concentrations . Compared with 0 mM Gln , the addition of 0.5 and 2 mM Gln to medium stimulated protein synthesis and inhibited protein degradation in those cells in both the short- and long-term studies . Ammonia ( 0.05 to 2.0 mM ) did not affect protein synthesis , although higher levels of ammonia ( 0.5 and 2.0 mM ) reduced protein degradation in IPEC-1 cells . Consistent with the data on protein turnover , 0.5 and 2 mM Gln increased abundance of phosphorylated P06730 -binding protein-1 and phosphorylated S6 kinase-1 proteins . Collectively , these results demonstrate that physiological levels of Gln regulate protein turnover independent of ammonia production in intestinal cells through the P42345 signaling pathway .
