Fibroblast growth factor-2 in hyperplastic pituitaries of D2R knockout female mice . P14416 ( D2R ) knockout ( KO ) female mice develop chronic hyperprolactinemia and pituitary hyperplasia . Our objective was to study the expression of the mitogen fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and its receptor , P11362 , comparatively in pituitaries from KO and wild-type ( WT ) female mice . We also evaluated P09038 subcellular localization and P09038 effects on pituitary function . P09038 -induced prolactin release showed a similar response pattern in both genotypes , even though basal and P09038 -stimulated release was higher in KO . P09038 stimulated pituitary cellular proliferation ( MTS assay and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation ) , with no differences between genotypes . P09038 concentration ( measured by ELISA ) in whole pituitaries or cultured cells was lower in KO ( P < 0.00001 and 0.00014 ) . Immunofluorescence histochemistry showed less P09038 in pituitaries from KO females and revealed a distinct P09038 localization pattern between genotypes , being predominantly nuclear in KO and cytosolic in WT pituitaries . Finally , P09038 could not be detected in the conditioned media from pituitary cultures of both genotypes . P11362 levels ( Western blot and immunohistochemistry ) were higher in pituitaries of KO . Basal concentration of phosphorylated ERKs was lower in KO cells ( P = 0.018 ) . However , when stimulated with P09038 , a significantly higher increment of P29323 phosphorylation was evidenced in KO cells ( P < or = 0.02 ) . We conclude that disruption of the D2R caused an overall decrease in pituitary P09038 levels , with an increased distribution in the nucleus , and increased P11362 levels . These results are important in the search for reliable prognostic indicators for patients with pituitary dopamine-resistant prolactinomas , which will make tumor-specific therapy possible .
