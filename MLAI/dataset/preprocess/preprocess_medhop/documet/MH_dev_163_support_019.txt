Integrated gene copy number and expression microarray analysis of gastric cancer highlights potential target genes . We performed an integrated array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) and expression microarray analysis of 8 normal gastric tissues and 38 primary tumors , including 25 intestinal and 13 diffuse gastric adenocarcinomas to identify genes whose expression is deregulated in association with copy number alteration . Our aim was also to identify molecular genetic alterations that are specific to particular clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer . Distinct molecular genetic profiles were identified for intestinal and diffuse gastric cancers and for tumors obtained from 2 different locations of the stomach . Interestingly , the P04626 amplification and gains at 20q13.12-q13.33 almost exclusively discriminated intestinal cancers from the diffuse type . In addition , the 17q12-q25 gain was characteristic to cancers located in corpus and the 20q13.12-q13.13 gain was more common in the antrum . Statistical analysis was performed using integrated copy number and expression data to identify genes showing differential expression associated with a copy number alteration . Genes with the highest statistical significance included P04626 , P15941 , Q14451 , Q9UD71 and Q15648 with concomitant changes in copy number and expression . Immunohistochemical analysis of P04626 and P15941 on a tissue microarray containing 78 independent gastric tissues showed statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05 and < 0.001 ) in immunopositivity in the intestinal ( 31 and 70 % ) and diffuse subtypes ( 14 and 41 % ) , respectively . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that intestinal and diffuse type gastric cancers as well as cancers located in different sites of the stomach have distinct molecular profiles which may have clinical value .
