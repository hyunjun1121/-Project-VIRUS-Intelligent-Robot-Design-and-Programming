DB08626 -induced neprilysin inhibition raises amyloid beta levels in rabbit cortex and cerebrospinal fluid . Studies on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) suggest overproduction of amyloid beta ( Abeta ) may not be the only pathogenic route to AD . Decreased degradation of Abeta is another possible disease mechanism . P08473 is a neutral endopeptidase that has been proposed to be the major enzyme responsible for Abeta degradation . Studies have reported correlations between Abeta deposition and neprilysin activity in the human brain . This study shows that intracerebroventricular infusion of thiorphan , a neprilysin inhibitor , raises cortical and cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) Abeta concentrations in rabbits . Rabbits treated with thiorphan for 5 days had levels of P04141 and cortical Abeta40 that were 147 and 142 % of the control group , respectively . Results for Abeta42 showed a similar trend . The results indicate that age-related decreases of neprilysin could lead to increased brain concentrations of Abeta , plaque formation , and AD .
