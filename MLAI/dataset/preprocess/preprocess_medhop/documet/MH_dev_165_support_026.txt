Endothelial Q09428 -8 acts in an P29323 -independent pathway during atrioventricular cushion development . Q09428 -8 , a conserved leucine-rich repeats protein , was first identified as a positive regulator of Ras pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans . Biochemical studies indicated that Q09428 -8 interacts with Ras and Raf , leading to the elevated P29323 activity . However , the physiological role of Q09428 -8 during mammalian development remains unclear . Here we found that germline deletion of Q09428 -8 in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality . Inactivated Q09428 -8 specifically in mouse endothelial cells ( ECs ) revealed that Q09428 -8 is essential for embryonic heart development . Q09428 -8 deficiency in ECs resulted in late embryonic lethality , and the mutant mice displayed multiple cardiac defects . The reduced endothelial-mesenchymal transformation ( EMT ) and the reduced mesenchyme proliferation phase were observed in the atrioventricular canal ( AVC ) within the mutant hearts , leading to the formation of hypoplastic endocardial cushions . However , P29323 activation did not appear to be affected in mutant ECs , suggesting that Q09428 -8 may act in an P29323 -independent pathway to regulate AVC development .
