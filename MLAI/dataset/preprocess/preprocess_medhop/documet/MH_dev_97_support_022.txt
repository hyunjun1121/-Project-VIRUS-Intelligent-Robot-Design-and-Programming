DB11588 donors or heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) overexpression blocks interleukin-18-mediated NF-kappaB- P60484 -dependent human cardiac endothelial cell death . The objective of this study was to determine whether heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) or heme metabolites exert cytoprotective effects on interleukin-18-mediated endothelial cell ( EC ) death . Treatment with interleukin ( IL ) -18 increased NF-kappaB activation and P60484 induction , suppressed Akt activation , and stimulated EC death . While ectopic expression of p65 enhanced P60484 transcription , adenoviral transduction of dnIkappaB-alpha , dnp65 , or dnIKKbeta was inhibitory . Furthermore , Q14116 suppressed P09601 mRNA expression via enhanced mRNA degradation . Overexpression of P09601 , treatment with P09601 inducer hemin , or the CO donor cobalt ( III ) protoporphyrin IX all reversed Q14116 -mediated NF-kappaB activation , P60484 induction , Akt suppression , and EC death . Furthermore , hemin induced P09601 expression , and P09601 knockdown , P09601 inhibition , or CO scavengers all reversed the prosurvival effects of hemin . In addition , the CO donors CORM-1 and CORM-3 and the heme metabolites biliverdin and bilirubin attenuated Q14116 -induced EC death via a similar signaling pathway . Q14116 induced p38alpha MAPK activation , and suppressed p38beta isoform expression . While p38alpha knockdown attenuated , p38beta knockdown potentiated Q14116 -mediated EC death . DB03404 and P09601 reversed Q14116 -mediated p38alpha induction and restored p38beta levels . These results demonstrate that Q14116 suppresses P09601 expression and induces EC death . P09601 overexpression , P09601 induction , or treatment with heme metabolites all reverse Q14116 -mediated p38alpha MAPK and NF-kappaB activation , P60484 induction , Akt suppression , and EC death . Thus , P09601 inducers and CO donors may have the therapeutic potential to effectively block Q14116 signaling and reduce Q14116 -dependent vascular injury and inflammation .
