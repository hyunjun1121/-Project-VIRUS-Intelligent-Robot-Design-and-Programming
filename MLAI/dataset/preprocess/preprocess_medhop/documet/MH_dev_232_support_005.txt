In situ generation of nitric oxide by myenteric neurons but not by mononuclear cells of the human colon . 1. Production of nitric oxide ( NO ) is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease . However , the cells responsible for the production of NO in situ in the human colon remain unknown . 2 . Surgical samples from 12 patients with ulcerative colitis , eight patients with Crohn 's disease and 10 controls were studied . Possible generation of NO was visualized by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) diaphorase activity in human colon . Immunohistological staining for various NO synthase ( NOS ) isoforms ( endothelial , neuronal and inducible ) , nitrotyrosine and interleukin-2 was also performed . 3 . Reduced NADPH diaphorase activity was not found in lamina propria mononuclear cells , but was found in colonic epithelium , endothelium and myenteric neurons and their processes . 4 . The NADPH-diaphorase activity positive processes were significantly less common in colon from patients with Crohn 's disease compared with control colon . 5 . P29474 was constitutively expressed on colonic endothelium . 6 . P29475 was constitutively expressed on myenteric neurons . 7 . Expression of inducible NOS ( P35228 ) was increased in the epithelium and endothelium of the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis . 8 . No correlation was found between expression of P35228 and NADPH diaphorase activity . 9 . Nitrotyrosine was expressed by lamina propria leucocytes , but not by epithelium . 10 . P60568 was expressed on both leucocytes and myenteric neurons . 11 . Colonic epithelium , endothelium and myenteric neurons synthesize NO . Myenteric neurons were principally responsible for NO production and NO may act as a neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system .
