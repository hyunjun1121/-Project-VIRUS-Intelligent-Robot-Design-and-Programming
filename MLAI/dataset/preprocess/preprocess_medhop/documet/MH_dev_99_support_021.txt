Genetic and epigenetic markers in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . BACKGROUND : Methylation markers have shown promise in the early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma . The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic utility of hypermethylation status of candidate genes in combination with P01116 mutation detection in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Sixty-one fine needle aspirates of pancreatic masses ( 43 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 18 chronic pancreatitis ) were studied . Methylation status of P25021 , Q05925 , P09486 , P55290 and P25054 were analysed using melting curve analysis after DNA bisulfite treatment . P01116 mutations were also analysed . RESULTS : The methylation panel had a sensitivity of 73 % ( 27 of 37 , CI 95 % 56 to 86 % ) and a specificity of 100 % whenever two or more promoters were found hypermethylated . P01116 mutations showed a sensitivity of 77 % ( 33 of 43 , CI 95 % 62 to 88 % ) and a specificity of 100 % . Both molecular analyses added useful information to cytology by increasing the number of informative cases . When genetic and epigenetic analyses were combined sensitivity was 84 % ( 36 of 43 CI 95 % 69 to 93 % ) maintaining a 100 % specificity . CONCLUSIONS : Analysis of hypermethylation status of a panel of genes and P01116 mutation detection offer a similar diagnostic yield in the evaluation of pancreatic masses . The combined molecular analysis increases the number of informative cases without diminishing specificity .
