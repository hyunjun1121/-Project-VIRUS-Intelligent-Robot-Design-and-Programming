Comparison of two polymer-based immunohistochemical detection systems : ENVISION+ and ImmPRESS . The non-specific background reaction produced in avidin-biotin-based immunohistochemistry , particularly after harsh antigen retrieval procedures , has promoted the use of non-avidin-biotin systems , yet there are few reports comparing the performance of non-avidin-biotin , polymer-based methods . In this study we compare two of these methods , ENVISION+trade mark and ImmPRESS , in animal tissues . We examined the immunoreactivity of 18 antigens in formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissues . Antigens were located in the cytoplasmic membrane ( CD11d , P05107 and CD79a ) , cytoplasm ( calretinin , P23219 , P35354 , Glut-1 , HepPar 1 , P10721 , Melan A , tryptase and uroplakin III ) or nucleus ( Q2TAK8 , P09936 and thyroid transcription factor 1 ) . We also evaluated three infectious agents ( Aspergillus , calicivirus and West Nile virus ) . The staining with ENVISION+ or ImmPRESS was performed simultaneously for each antigen . The intensity of the reaction and background staining were scored . ImmPRESS yielded similar or higher reaction intensity than ENVISION+trade mark in 16/18 antigens . ImmPRESS produced abundant background with the other two antigens ( calretinin and P35354 ) , which hindered interpretation of the specific reaction . The cost of ImmPRESS was 25 % lower than for ENVISION+trade mark . Based on these results , ImmPRESS is a good polymer-based detection system for routine immunohistochemistry .
