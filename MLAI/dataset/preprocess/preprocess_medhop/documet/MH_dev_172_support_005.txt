8-OH-DPAT ( P08908 agonist ) Attenuates 6-Hydroxy- dopamine-induced catalepsy and Modulates Inflammatory Cytokines in Rats . OBJECTIVE(S) : Neuroinflammation in Parkinson disease ( PD ) is associated with glial cells activation and production of different inflammatory cytokines . In this study , we investigated the effect of chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT on 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy and levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Catalepsy was induced by unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA ( 8 μg/2 μl/rat ) into the central region of the sabstantia nigra pars compacta ( SNc ) being assessed by the bar-test , 5 , 60 , 120 and 180 min after intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration of 8-OH-DPAT ( P08908 receptor agonist ; 0.25 , 0.5 and 1mg/kg , IP for 10 days ) . P04141 samples were collected on the tenth day of 8-OH-DPAT administration and analyzed by ELISA method to measure levels of P01375 -α , IL-1β and P05231 . RESULTS : Chronic injection of 8-OH-DPAT decreased catalepsy in a dose dependent manner when compared with the control group . The most anti-cataleptic effect was observed at the dose of 1 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT . Levels of P01375 -α in P04141 increased three weeks after 6-OHDA injection while there was a significant decrease in P01375 -α level of parkinsonian animals treated with 8-OH-DPAT ( 1 mg/kg , IP for 10 days ) . IL-1β and P05231 decreased and increased in parkinsonian rats and in 8-OH-DPAT-treated parkinsonian rats , respectively . CONCLUSION : Our study indicated that chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT improves catalepsy in 6-OHDA-induced animal model of PD and restores central concentration of inflammatory cytokines to the basal levels . P08908 receptor agonists can be suggested as potential adjuvant therapy in PD by modulation of cerebral inflammatory cytokines .
