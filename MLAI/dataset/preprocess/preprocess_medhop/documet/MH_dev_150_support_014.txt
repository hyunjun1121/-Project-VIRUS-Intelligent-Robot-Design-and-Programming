DB00624 and androgen receptor in human nephrolithiasis . PURPOSE : We investigated the relationship of kidney calculi with plasma free and total testosterone , and androgen receptor up-regulation in the kidneys of men with nephrolithiasis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Male patients with kidney stone and healthy men were included in the study . Blood was collected in a tube containing 2 % heparin in the morning . Total and free serum testosterone was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . All patients underwent percutaneous nephrostolithotomy . At the end of the procedure ultrasound guided puncture biopsy was done to acquire kidney tissue . Normal kidney tissue obtained at autopsy served as the control . P10275 was detected in kidney tissue by immunohistochemistry . Stone composition was analyzed in each patient . RESULTS : The study included 37 male patients 22 to 39 years old and 31 healthy men 24 to 37 years old . All calculi were composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate or calcium oxalate dihydrate and a few also contained protein or uric acid . Mean±SD serum total and free testosterone was 13.29±4.79 ng/ml and 63.23±28.58 pg/ml in patients , and 7.30±0.82 ng/ml and 35.59±24.91 pg/ml in healthy men , respectively ( each p < 0.001 ) . Immunohistochemistry revealed androgen receptor up-regulation in the kidneys of patients with nephrolithiasis . CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest the important role of enhanced androgen signaling in human nephrolithiasis .
