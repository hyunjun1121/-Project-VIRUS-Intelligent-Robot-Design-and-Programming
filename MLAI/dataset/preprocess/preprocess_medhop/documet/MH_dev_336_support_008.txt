P21554 inhibition improves cardiac function and remodelling after myocardial infarction and in experimental metabolic syndrome . The cannabinoid receptors , P21554 and CB2 , are expressed in the heart , but their role under pathological conditions remains controversial . This study examined the effect of P21554 receptor blockade on cardiovascular functions after experimental MI and in experimental metabolic syndrome . MI was induced in Wistar rats by permanent ligation of the left coronary artery . Treatment with the P21554 receptor antagonist rimonabant ( 10 mg/kg i.p. daily ) started 7 days before or 6 h after MI and continued for 6 weeks . Haemodynamic parameters were measured via echocardiography and intracardiac Samba catheter . P21554 blockade improved systolic and diastolic heart function , decreased cardiac collagen and hydroxyproline content and down-regulated TGF-β1 . Additionally , rimonabant decreased arterial stiffness , normalised QRS complex duration and reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels in serum . In primary cardiac fibroblasts , rimonabant decreased P14780 activity and TGF-β1 expression . Furthermore , rimonabant improved depressed systolic function of spontaneously hypertensive obese rats and reduced weight gain . Blocking of P21554 receptor with rimonabant improves cardiac functions in the early and late stages after MI , decreases arterial stiffness and reduces cardiac remodelling . DB06155 also has cardioprotective actions in rats characterised by the metabolic syndrome . Inhibition of proteolysis and TGF-β1 expression and reduced collagen content by rimonabant may attenuate destruction of the extracellular matrix and decrease fibrosis after MI .
