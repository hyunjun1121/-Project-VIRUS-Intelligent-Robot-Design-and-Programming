Anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs and pharmacogenetic considerations . INTRODUCTION : The development of pharmacogenetic-based clinical practice guidelines for the use of anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs requires , as a pre-requisite , the identification and validation of genetic biomarkers . These biomarkers are then used as surrogate endpoints . This review analyzes potential genetic biomarkers which can be used to improve anti-Parkinson 's disease therapy . AREAS COVERED : The authors present an overview of current knowledge of pharmacogenetic implications of anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs , including genes coding for the corresponding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets . The gene/drug pairings with the strongest potential for pharmacogenetic recommendations include : P33261 /benztropine , P21964 /levodopa and entacapone , P20813 /selegiline , P22309 /entacapone , P14416 /ropinirole , pramipexole and cabergoline , and P35462 /ropinirole and pramipexole . Evidence supporting the effect of substrates , inhibitor or inducers for drug specific metabolizing enzymes in anti-Parkinson 's disease drug response includes P05177 in the response to ropinirole and rasagiline , and P08684 in the response to bromocriptine , lisuride , pergolide and cabergoline . The authors present and discuss the current information on gene variations according to the 1000 genomes catalog and other databases with regards to anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs . They also review and discuss the clinical implications of these variations . EXPERT OPINION : The goal of pharmacogenomic testing for anti-Parkinson 's disease drugs should be conservative and aimed at selecting determined drugs for determined patients . However , much additional research is still needed to obtain reliable pre-prescription tests .
