In vivo cytokine responses to interleukin-2 immunotherapy after autologous stem cell transplantation in children with solid tumors . The potent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) has been extensively investigated for its potential to induce anti-tumor immunity in a number of tumor models . Only recently the complex interplay of mutually suppressive or supportive cytokines of the P60568 -induced network of cytokines has been better characterized . The aim of this study was to assess which of these in vitro findings are reproducible in vivo in recipients of stem cell transplants ( P09683 ) , since in these patients long- lasting impairments in cytokine inducibility have been described . We have therefore studied the kinetics of putative modulators and mediators of P60568 -induced immune activation , namely IL-1beta , P05112 , P05113 , P22301 , IL-12 , soluble P48023 ( sFasL ) , and GM- P04141 during P60568 therapy . All patients were children or adolescents suffering from solid tumors with poor prognosis who received three 5-day courses of high-dose intravenous P60568 as an adjuvant to their radio-chemotherapy and autologous P09683 . While IL-1beta , P05112 and IL-12 were not , and sFasL was only mildly affected by the P60568 therapy , we observed a consistent and early rise of P22301 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 . These increases were rapidly reversible after discontinuation of P60568 therapy . The inducibility of P22301 , P05113 and GM- P04141 was more pronounced with increasing time from the P09683 , and in the third cycle reached an order of magnitude as in high-dose P60568 patients without P09683 . Together with the abundant in vitro data , these findings may help devise a combination immunotherapy permitting stronger anti-tumor effects , but lesser adverse effects .
