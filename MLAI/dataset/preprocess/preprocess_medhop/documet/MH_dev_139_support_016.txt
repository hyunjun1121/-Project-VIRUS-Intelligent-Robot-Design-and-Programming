Microvascular injury and blood-brain barrier leakage in Alzheimer 's disease . Thinning and discontinuities within the vascular basement membrane ( VBM ) are associated with leakage of the plasma protein prothrombin across the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . P00734 immunohistochemistry and ELISA assays were performed on prefrontal cortex . In severe AD , prothrombin was localized within the wall and neuropil surrounding microvessels . Factor VIII staining in severe AD patients indicated that prothrombin leakage was associated with shrinkage of endothelial cells . ELISA revealed elevated prothrombin levels in prefrontal cortex AD cases that increased with the Braak stage ( Control=1.39 , I-II=1.76 , III-IV=2.28 , and V-VI=3.11 ng prothrombin/mg total protein ) . Comparing these four groups , there was a significant difference between control and Braak V-VI ( p=0.0095 ) and also between Braak stages I-II and V-VI ( p=0.0048 ) . There was no significant difference in mean prothrombin levels when cases with versus without cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( CAA ) were compared ( p-value=0.3627 ) . When comparing AD patients by P02649 genotype ( ApoE3,3=2.00 , ApoE3,4=2.49 , and ApoE4,4=2.96 ng prothrombin/mg total protein ) an analysis of variance indicated a difference between genotypes at the 10 % significance level ( p=0.0705 ) . Tukey 's test indicated a difference between the 3,3 and 4,4 groups ( p=0.0607 ) . These studies provide evidence that in advanced AD ( Braak stage V-VI ) , plasma proteins like prothrombin can be found within the microvessel wall and surrounding neuropil , and that leakage of the blood-brain barrier may be more common in patients with at least one APOE4 allele .
