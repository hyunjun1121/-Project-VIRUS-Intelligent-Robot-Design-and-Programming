P10275 is expressed in murine choroid plexus and downregulated by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone in male and female mice . The choroid plexuses ( CPs ) of the brain form a unique interface between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) . CPs produce several neuroprotective peptides , which are secreted into the P04141 . Despite their importance in neuroprotection , the mechanisms underlying the regulation of most of these peptides in CPs remain unknown . Androgens regulate the expression of neuroprotective peptides in several tissues where the androgen receptor ( AR ) is coexpressed , including the brain . The presence of AR in CPs has never been investigated , but recent studies in our laboratory show that the CP is an androgen-responsive tissue . In order to fulfill this gap , we investigated and characterized AR distribution and expression in male and female rat CPs and in primary cultures from rat CP epithelial cells . In addition , the response of AR to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) in castrated male and female mice subjected to DB02901 replacement was analyzed . We show that rat CP epithelial cells contain AR mRNA and protein . Moreover , we demonstrate that AR is downregulated by DB02901 in mice CPs .
