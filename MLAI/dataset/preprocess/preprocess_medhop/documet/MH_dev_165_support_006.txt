Disease stabilization of progressive olfactory neuroblastoma ( esthesioneuroblastoma ) under treatment with sunitinib mesylate . Olfactory neuroblastoma ( esthesioneuroblastoma ) is a rare neoplasm of the olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity . Here , we report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with massive progression of a metastatic esthesioneuroblastoma after endonasal resection , functional neck dissection , and radiotherapy of local and distant tumor relapses . After exhaustion of all conventional therapeutic options , we initiated treatment with the oral multityrosinekinase inhibitor sunitinib mesylate . Using this drug , significant improvement of clinical symptoms , disease stabilization , and recovery from Karnofsky index of 40 % to 70 % could be achieved in the absence of significant adverse drug effects . The patient died 15 months after initiation of sunitinib therapy due to complications of a traumatic femoral neck fracture without evidence of tumor progression . Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue specimens obtained at initial surgery revealed ample expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) -b on stromal and endothelial cells . DB01268 should be considered for palliative therapy of advanced esthesioneuroblastoma .
