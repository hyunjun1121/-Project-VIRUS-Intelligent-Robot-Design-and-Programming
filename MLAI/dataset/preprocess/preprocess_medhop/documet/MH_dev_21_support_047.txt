P09486 -induced migration of glioblastoma cell lines via uPA- Q03405 signaling and activation of small GTPase RhoA . P09486 ( P09486 ) is highly expressed in human gliomas where it promotes invasion and delays tumor growth , both in vitro and in vivo . P09486 , which interacts at the cell surface , has an impact on intracellular signaling and downstream gene expression changes , which might account for some of its effects on invasion and growth . Additionally in vitro studies demonstrated that P09486 delays growth , increases attachment , and modulates migration of tumor cells in an extracellular matrix-specific and concentration-dependent manner . Because the signaling aspect of this migration is neither well understood nor characterized , we overexpressed P09486 in both the minimally-invasive U87 cell line and in the most aggressive invasive cell line , SNB19 . We first performed RT-PCR analysis and observed an upregulation of uPA and its receptor , Q03405 . We also observed increased expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 ( P08253 and P14780 ) . Western blot analysis confirmed these results , and the enzymatic activity of the metalloproteinases and uPA was further supported by zymography . Downstream of the uPA- Q03405 interaction , upregulation of P19957 -K occurred in cells overexpressing P09486 . Using Q86UG4 -TRBD , we showed the upregulation of active GTP-bound RhoA , but neither Rac1 nor Cdc42 were activated . The inhibition of uPA and Q03405 downregulated P19957 -K activity and cell migration , as shown by matrigel invasion assay . A dorsal skin-fold chamber model revealed the high angiogenic activity of P09486 , though the proliferation of P09486 overexpressing cells was unaffected . Our results show that the small GTPase RhoA was a critical mediator of invasion or migration in the uPA- Q03405 / P19957 -K signaling pathway .
