Mobilization of P29590 - P10276 negative blood stem cells and salvage with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in children with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia . BACKGROUND : Relapsed acute promyleocytic leukemia ( APL ) is treated with re-induction chemotherapy , commonly arsenic trioxide , and stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) . The effect of arsenic trioxide on autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection is unknown . PROCEDURE : Five pediatric patients with relapsed APL had P29590 - P10276 negative peripheral blood stem cells mobilized ( four after arsenic trioxide ) and underwent autologous P09683 after cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg x 2 ) and total body irradiation ( TBI-fractionated 1,200 cGy ) conditioning . RESULTS : All five patients remain in molecular remission a median of 20 months post-transplant . CONCLUSION : Autologous P09683 performed during molecular remission is a treatment option for pediatric patients with relapsed APL and may provide durable leukemia-free survival without the complications of allogeneic transplantation .
