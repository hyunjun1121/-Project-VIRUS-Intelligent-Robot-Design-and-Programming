Transforming growth factor-beta1 induces tumor stroma and reduces tumor infiltrate in cervical cancer . Cervical carcinomas consist of tumor cell nests surrounded by varying amounts of intratumoral stroma containing different quantities and types of immune cells . Besides controlling ( epithelial ) cell growth , the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-beta(1) ( TGF-beta(1) ) is involved in the formation of stroma and extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) and in immunosuppression . Several malignancies are known to be associated with enhanced production of TGF-beta(1) , repression or mutation of TGF-beta transmembrane receptors , or mutations at the postreceptor intracellular signaling pathway . The aim of our study was to investigate the role of tumor cell-derived TGF-beta(1) on the amount of intratumoral stroma ; the deposition of collagen IV , fibronectin , and laminin ; and the tumor infiltrate in cervical carcinoma . The expression of TGF-beta(1) mRNA in 108 paraffin-embedded cervical carcinomas was detected by mRNA in situ hybridization . Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the amount of tumor stroma and Q13201 proteins and the extent of the tumor infiltrate . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) protein expression in tumor cells was determined to verify the biological activity of TGF-beta(1.) Cytoplasmatic TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in tumor cells was significantly correlated with the amount of intratumoral stroma and the deposition of collagen IV . TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in every tumor was accompanied by P05121 expression , indicating biological activity of TGF-beta(1) . An inverse relationship between TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in tumor cells and the extent of the tumor infiltrate was demonstrated . Our results indicate that cervical cancer cells affect the amount and the composition of the intratumoral stroma and the tumor infiltrate by the production and secretion of TGF-beta(1) .
