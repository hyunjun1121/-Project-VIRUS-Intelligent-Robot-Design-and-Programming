Erlotinib ( DB00530 ) -induced inhibition of transitional cell carcinoma of bladder cell line growth is enhanced by interferon-alpha . OBJECTIVE : To examine whether erlotinib gives similar results to gefitinib , a small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 / P00533 ) tyrosine kinase ( TK ) inhibitor that inhibits the growth of human bladder cancer cell lines in vitro , and given that interferon-alpha ( IFNalpha ) promotes an antiproliferative effect of P00533 / P00533 inhibitors on colon cancer cell lines , to also determine the effects of erlotinib alone or together with INFalpha on bladder cancer cell lines , and whether sensitivity is influenced by P00533 / P00533 mutation status . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Seven bladder cancer cell lines were characterized for P00533 / P00533 expression , then treated with erlotinib alone , IFNalpha alone , or IFNalpha plus erlotinib . Cell growth inhibition was assessed by crystal-violet staining and P00533 / P00533 expression by flow cytometry . Synergy was evaluated using the combination index of Chou and Talalay . DNA from these cell lines in the linear growth phase and from 14 bladder cancer tissue samples were tested for P00533 /EGFRTK mutations . RESULTS : Cell-surface P00533 / P00533 expression was present in all seven bladder cancer cell lines . Both erlotinib and IFNalpha independently were significantly antiproliferative , and combined treatment synergistically enhanced the sensitivity in six of the seven cell lines . No bladder cancer cell lines or tissues tested expressed P00533 /EGFRTK mutations . CONCLUSION : Erlotinib inhibits the growth of human bladder cancer cell lines . Enhanced inhibition in the presence of IFNalpha is not determined by the presence of P00533 /EGFRTK mutations . This study might have clinical implications for improving the treatment of bladder cancer .
