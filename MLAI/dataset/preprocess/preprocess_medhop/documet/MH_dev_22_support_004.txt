Carcinomatous meningitis : Leptomeningeal metastases in solid tumors . Leptomeningeal metastasis ( LM ) results from metastatic spread of cancer to the leptomeninges , giving rise to central nervous system dysfunction . Breast cancer , lung cancer , and melanoma are the most frequent causes of LM among solid tumors in adults . An early diagnosis of LM , before fixed neurologic deficits are manifest , permits earlier and potentially more effective treatment , thus leading to a better quality of life in patients so affected . Apart from a clinical suspicion of LM , diagnosis is dependent upon demonstration of cancer in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) or radiographic manifestations as revealed by neuraxis imaging . Potentially of use , though not commonly employed , today are use of biomarkers and protein profiling in the P04141 . Symptomatic treatment is directed at pain including headache , nausea , and vomiting , whereas more specific LM-directed therapies include intra- P04141 chemotherapy , systemic chemotherapy , and site-specific radiotherapy . A special emphasis in the review discusses novel agents including targeted therapies , that may be promising in the future management of LM . These new therapies include anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer , anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in breast cancer , anti- P16410 ipilimumab and anti- P15056 tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vermurafenib in melanoma , and the antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab are currently under investigation in patients with LM . Challenges of managing patients with LM are manifold and include determining the appropriate patients for treatment as well as the optimal route of administration of intra- P04141 drug therapy .
