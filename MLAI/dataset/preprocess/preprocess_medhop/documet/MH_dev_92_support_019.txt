Neem leaf glycoprotein suppresses regulatory T cell mediated suppression of monocyte/macrophage functions . We have shown that neem leaf glycoprotein ( NLGP ) inhibits the regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) induced suppression of tumoricidal functions of P08571 (+) P34810 (+) monocyte/macrophages ( MO/Mφ ) from human peripheral blood . Cytotoxic efficacy of MO/Mφ toward macrophage sensitive cells , U937 , is decreased in presence of Tregs ( induced ) , however , it was increased further by supplementation of NLGP in culture . Associated Treg mediated inhibition of perforin/granzyme B expression and nitric oxide release from MO/Mφ was normalized by NLGP . Altered status of signature cytokines , like , IL-12 , P22301 , P05231 , TNFα from MO/Mφ under influence of Tregs is also rectified by NLGP . Tregs significantly enhanced the expression of altered marker , mannose receptor ( CD206 ) on P34810 (+) cells that was downregulated upon NLGP exposure . In addition to tumoricidal functions , antigen presenting ability of MO/Mφ is hampered by Treg induced downregulation of P33681 , P42081 and HLA- DB01048 . NLGP upregulated these molecules in MO/Mφ even in the presence of Tregs . Treg mediated inhibition of MO/Mφ chemotaxis in contact dependent manner was also normalized partially by NLGP , where participation of P51681 was documented . Overall results suggest that Treg influenced pro-tumor MO/Mφ functions are rectified in a significant extent by NLGP to create an anti-tumor immune environment .
