Genetic mechanism of aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : DB00945 -induced urticaria/angioedema is a major aspirin-related hypersensitivity often associated with aspirin-intolerant asthma . Genetic studies on aspirin-intolerant asthma have shown chronic overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes . The genetic analysis of aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema is limited , however . RECENT FINDINGS : A recent study on HLA genotypes has suggested that the HLA alleles DRB11302 and DQB10609 may be genetic markers for aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema . A polymorphism study that examined nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms of five leukotriene-related genes [ P09917 ( encoding P09917 ) , P20292 ( P09917 -activating protein ) , P35354 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ) , Q16873 ( leukotriene C4 synthase ) , and Q9Y271 ( cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 ) ] found that promoter polymorphisms of P09917 ( -1708A > G ) and Q9Y271 ( -634C > T ) were significantly different between aspirin-intolerant asthma and aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema , suggesting different contributions to the lipoxygenase pathway . A second polymorphism study , conducted on histamine-related genes , did not find any significant associations with aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema for the genes P50135 ( encoding histamine N-methyltransferase ) , P35367 or P25021 ( encoding histamine receptor types 1 and 2 respectively ) , or the gene encoding high-affinity IgE receptor Ibeta ( FcepsilonRIbeta ) ; however , the FcepsilonRIalpha gene promoter polymorphism was significantly associated with aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema . This finding has been supported by in vitro functional studies . SUMMARY : The HLA alleles DRB11302 and DQB10609 , and the P09917 and FcepsilonRIalpha promoter polymorphisms , may contribute to the pathogenesis of aspirin-induced urticaria/angioedema . Further investigation to identify candidate genetic markers would help to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of this condition .
