A new locus for late-onset , progressive , hereditary hearing loss DFNA20 maps to 17q25 . We report the localization of DFNA20 , a gene causing dominant , nonsyndromic , progressive hearing loss in a three-generation Midwestern family , to chromosome 17q25 . Affected family members show a bilateral , sloping , progressive , sensorineural hearing loss , first evident at 6000 and 8000 Hz , that can be identified in some family members in the early teens and is clearly evident by the early twenties . As age increases , the degree of hearing loss increases with threshold shifts seen at all frequencies . Linkage to known hereditary hearing loss loci was excluded . A genome-wide screen detected positive linkage to D17S784 ( LOD(Z) = 6.62 ; & theta ; = 0 ) . Haplotype analysis refines the DFNA20 critical region to 12 cM between D17S1806 and D17S668 . Radiation hybrid mapping with Stanford P46379 and TNG panels was used to evaluate the genes P63261 , Q14957 , Q92949 , P07237 , P09486 , and P52565 as candidates for DFNA20 .
