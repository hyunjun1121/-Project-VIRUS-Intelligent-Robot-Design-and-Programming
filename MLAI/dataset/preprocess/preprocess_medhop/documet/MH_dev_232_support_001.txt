Role of monoamine oxidases in the exaggerated 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced tension development of human isolated preeclamptic umbilical artery . We investigated the role(s) of monoamine oxidases ( MAOs ) on the altered 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT , serotonin ) -induced tension development of the isolated umbilical artery of preeclamptic pregnancy of Chinese women . An enhanced 5-HT-induced tension development of the umbilical artery of preeclamptic pregnancy was observed when compared with that of normal pregnancy . The enhanced component of 5-HT-induced tension development was eradicated by clorgyline ( a P21397 inhibitor ) . Blockade of P29474 ( endothelial isoform nitric oxide synthase ) ( N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ) , 5-HT transporter ( citalopram ) , 5-HT receptor subtypes ( 5HT2B , SB 204741 ; P28335 , RS 102221 ; P34969 , SB 269970 ) , and endothelium denudation of the umbilical artery of normal pregnancy mimicked the enhanced 5-HT-induced tension development as observed in the preeclamptic tissues . In contrast , no apparent changes in 5-HT-induced tension development of the umbilical artery of preeclamptic pregnancy were observed with the same pharmacological manipulations . A decreased protein expression levels of P21397 and P29474 ( no P35228 and P27338 expression was detected ) and no change in caveolin-1 and 5-HT transporter expression were demonstrated in the umbilical artery ( endothelium intact ) lysate of preeclamptic pregnancy , compared to that of the umbilical artery of normal pregnancy . Thus , in the umbilical artery of preeclamptic pregnancy , a decrease of P21397 and P29474 protein expression levels are probably associated with , or responsible for , the exaggerated 5-HT-induced tension development .
