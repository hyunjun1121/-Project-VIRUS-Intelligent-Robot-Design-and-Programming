Effects of endothelin P25101 receptor antagonism on granulocyte and lymphocyte accumulation in LPS-induced inflammation . Endothelin peptides play active roles in different aspects of inflammation . This study investigates the contribution of endogenous endothelins to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) pulmonary inflammation by assessing the influence of ET(A) receptor antagonism on leukocyte accumulation , granulocyte adhesion molecule expression , and chemokine/cytokine modulation . Local pretreatment with BQ-123 or A-127722 ( 150 pmol ) , two selective and chemically unrelated endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonists , inhibits neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation in LPS-induced pleurisy at 24 h but not neutrophil migration at 4 h . The effect of endothelin antagonism on neutrophil accumulation at 24 h was concomitant with inhibition of eosinophil and P01730 and CD8 T lymphocyte influx . It is surprising that the ET(A) receptor blockade did not inhibit the accumulation of gammadelta T lymphocytes , cells that are important for granulocyte recruitment in this model . Blockade of ET(A) receptors did not influence the expression of adhesion molecules ( CD11b , CD49d ) on granulocytes but abrogated the increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha levels 4 h after LPS stimulation and also markedly inhibited increases in levels of interleukin-6 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine/CXC chemokine ligand 1 but not eotaxin/chemokine ligand 11 . Thus , acting via ET(A) receptors , endogenous endothelins play an important role in early cytokine/chemokine production and on granulocyte and lymphocyte mobilization in LPS-induced pleurisy .
