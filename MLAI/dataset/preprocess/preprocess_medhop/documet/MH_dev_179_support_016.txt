All-trans retinoic acid inhibits the increases in fibronectin and P05121 induced by TGF-beta1 and Ang II in rat mesangial cells . AIM : To investigate the effect of all-trans RA ( atRA ) on the increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) and fibronectin that are induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) and angiotensin II ( Ang II ) in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells . METHODS : Subconfluent glomerular mesangial cells were serum-starved for 48 h and pretreated with atRA with subsequent stimulation of TGF-beta1 and Ang II . Protein expressions of cell-associated fibronectin and P05121 in glomerular mesangial cells were evaluated by Western blot analysis . mRNA expression of RA receptors in glomerular mesangial cells was examined by RT-PCR . RESULTS : Retinoic acid receptor-alpha , -gamma ( P10276 , -gamma ) and retinoid X receptor-alpha , -beta , -gamma ( RXR-alpha , -beta , -gamma ) mRNA were expressed in rat glomerular mesangial cells . atRA pretreatment effectively reduced fibronectin expression in glomerular mesangial cells stimulated with TGF-beta 1 or Ang II for 48 h . TGF-beta 1 stimulated P05121 expression reached a maximum at 5 h . atRA did n't affect the early ( 5 h ) P05121 induction by TGF-beta 1 , but markedly attenuated the sustained ( 48 h ) P05121 induction . atRA also decreased the prolonged effect of Ang II on P05121 expression . CONCLUSION : These results indicate that atRA inhibits the increases in fibronectin that are induced by TGF-beta1 and Ang II in cultured glomerular mesangial cells . The data also suggest that this effect of atRA is associated with a change in P05121 levels .
