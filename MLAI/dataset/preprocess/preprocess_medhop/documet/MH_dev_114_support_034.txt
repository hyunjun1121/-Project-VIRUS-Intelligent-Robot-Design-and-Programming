4- DB00233 , in contrast to DB00244 , has no effect on arachidonic acid metabolism in human neutrophils , or on the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl . 5- DB00233 seems to be the active moiety of sulfasalazine in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease . Even if the precise mode of action is obscure , it is assumed that two of the main mechanisms are inhibitory effects on the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid and interaction with free radicals . As DB00233 has been claimed to be beneficial in the topical treatment of ulcerative colitis , it was tested whether this drug possesses any influence on the P09917 activity in human neutrophils in vitro or whether it acts as a radical scavenger . The change of the amino residue from carbon-5 to carbon-4 abolished the effect in the two systems tested . The reported clinical observations on DB00233 in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease remain to be confirmed and can not be explained by interference with arachidonic acid metabolism or free oxygen radicals .
