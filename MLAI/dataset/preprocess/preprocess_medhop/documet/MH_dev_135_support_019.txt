DB00563 in pediatric osteosarcoma : response and toxicity in relation to genetic polymorphisms and dihydrofolate reductase and reduced folate carrier 1 expression . OBJECTIVE : To determine the influence of the genotype and the level of expression of different enzymes involved in folate metabolism on the response to and toxicity of high-dose methotrexate treatment in pediatric osteosarcomas . STUDY DESIGN : P00374 and Reduced folate carrier 1 ( RFC1 ) semiquantitative expression was analyzed in 34 primary and metastatic osteosarcoma tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction . The following polymorphisms were also analyzed in peripheral blood from 96 children with osteosarcoma and 110 control subjects : C677T , A1298C ( P42898 ) , G80A ( RFC1 ) , A2756G ( Q99707 ) , C1420T ( SHMT ) , the 28bp-repeat polymorphism , and 1494del6 of the P04818 gene . Treatment toxicity was scored after each cycle according to criteria from the World Health Organization . RESULTS : P00374 and RFC1 expression was lower in initial osteosarcoma biopsy specimens than in metastases ( P = .024 and P = .041 , respectively ) . RFC1 expression was moderately decreased in samples with poor histologic response to preoperative treatment ( P = .053 ) . Patients with osteosarcoma with P46379 /G4 hematologic toxicity were more frequently TT than CT/CC for C677T/ P42898 ( P = .023 ) and GG for A2756G/ Q99707 ( P = .048 and P = .057 for gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS : The role of C677T/ P42898 and A2756G/ Q99707 on chemotherapy-induced toxicity should be further investigated in pediatric osteosarcomas receiving high-dose methotrexate . Altered expression of P00374 and RFC1 is a feasible mechanism by which osteosarcoma cells become resistant to methotrexate .
