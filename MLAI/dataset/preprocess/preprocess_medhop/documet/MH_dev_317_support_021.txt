Mutations in the circadian gene O15516 in colorectal cancer . The circadian clock regulates daily variations in physiologic processes . O15516 acts as a regulator in the circadian apparatus controlling the expression of other clock genes , including O15534 . Clock genes have been implicated in cancer-related functions ; in this work , we investigated O15516 as a possible target of somatic mutations in microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers . Combining microarray gene expression data and public gene sequence information , we identified O15516 as 1 of 790 putative novel microsatellite instability ( MSI ) target genes . A total of 101 MSI colorectal carcinomas ( CRC ) were sequenced for a coding microsatellite in O15516 . The effect of restoring O15516 expression was studied in LS180 cells lacking wild-type O15516 by stably expressing Q86UG4 - O15516 or glutathione S-transferase empty vector and testing the effects of UV-induced apoptosis and radiation by DNA content analysis using flow cytometry . Putative novel O15516 target genes were searched by using ChIP-seq . O15516 mutations occurred in 53 % of MSI CRCs . Restoring O15516 expression in cells with biallelic O15516 inactivation resulted in protection against UV-induced apoptosis and decreased G(2)-M arrest in response to ionizing radiation . Using ChIP-Seq , novel O15516 -binding elements were identified near DNA damage genes P38936 , Q14596 , P38398 , and Q92878 . O15516 is shown to be mutated in cancer , and altered response to DNA damage provides one plausible mechanism of tumorigenesis .
