Hormonal regulation of human trophoblast differentiation : a possible role for 17beta-estradiol and DB00644 . We have examined the role of 17beta-estradiol and gonadotropin releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) in the regulation of functional differentiation in human trophoblasts . In contrast to its recognized functions as a proliferation-promoting hormone in a variety of cell types , we found that 17beta-estradiol induced terminal differentiation in human trophoblastic cells , and that this event was estrogen-receptor-mediated . This process involved a loss in expression of Cyclins A2 and E , and a coincident increase in p27(Kip1) . The anti-proliferative effects of 17beta-estradiol were annulled by specific transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGFbeta1 ) -neutralizing antibody , suggesting that 17beta-estradiol may mediate its growth-inhibitory actions , through TGFbeta1 activity . Following exposure to DB06719 , cultured human trophoblastic cells stopped proliferating and formed functionally mature syncytiotrophoblasts . This differentiation event , that involved a drastic loss in expression of proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen , could be blocked by DB00050 , suggesting the involvement of functional DB00644 receptors . Preliminary studies on the characterization of the human placental P30968 , indicate the presence of multiple receptor isoforms across human gestation .
