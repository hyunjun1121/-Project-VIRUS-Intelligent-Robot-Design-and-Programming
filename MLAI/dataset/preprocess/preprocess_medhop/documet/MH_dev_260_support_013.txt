The effects of DB05294 , an inhibitor of P15692 signaling , on cutaneous wound healing in mice . BACKGROUND : DB05294 is an inhibitor of the P35968 receptor tyrosine kinase with additional activity against P00533 -1 receptor tyrosine kinases that has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and wound-induced neovascularization in pre-clinical studies and phase I clinical trials . The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of DB05294 on breaking strength in a murine model of cutaneous wound healing . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Balb/C mice were given DB05294 ( 50 or 100 mg/kg p.o. ) or vehicle starting 7 days before wounding . Two full-thickness incisions were made in each mouse and closed using suture . On post-wounding day 7 or 28 , laser Doppler blood flow measurements were made , and the breaking strength of the wounded skin was determined . Microvessel density measurements were performed using computer image analysis of CD31-stained sections . RESULTS : Compared with controls , mice treated with DB05294 showed a significantly reduced dose-dependent decline in breaking strength , both at POD 7 ( P < 0.001 ) and at POD 28 ( P < 0.005 ) . Histologically , the DB05294 -treated mice showed a qualitative reduction in the degree of fibrosis and epithelial proliferation at the wound site , but no significant difference was noted between the 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg DB05294 -treated groups . Also , microvessel density measurements demonstrated no significant difference between groups . CONCLUSION : In a murine model of wound healing , DB05294 treatment did not prevent wound healing , but was associated with a reduced skin breaking strength compared with vehicle-treated controls at both 7 and 28 days post-wounding . These observations may have clinical relevance for the perioperative management of patients treated with inhibitors of angiogenesis .
