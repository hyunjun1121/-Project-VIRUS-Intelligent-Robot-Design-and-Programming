P06401 level as a predictor of response to megestrol acetate in advanced breast cancer : a retrospective study . DB00351 ( 160 mg/day ) produced a response rate of 44 % in a retrospective series of 39 evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer . The estrogen-receptor ( ER ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 28 patients , and the progesterone-receptor ( PR ) level was greater than 10 fmols/mg of protein in 26 patients . ER and PR levels , age , and disease-free interval were analyzed for their relationship to response . The PR was the single best predictor of response to megestrol acetate ; the addition of ER added 2 % to the predictive accuracy rate of PR alone .
