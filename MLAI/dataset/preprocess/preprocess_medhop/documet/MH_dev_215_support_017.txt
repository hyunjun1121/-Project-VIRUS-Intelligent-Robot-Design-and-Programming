Genetics of physical activity and physical inactivity in humans . Emerging evidence suggests that physical activity and sedentary behavior [ reflected in physical inactivity ( PI ) ] , might be two different phenotypes that may have distinct underlying physiological mechanisms . The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing literature on the genetic determinants of PA and PI phenotypes in humans , considering them as distinct behaviors . Completed in January 2011 , this review includes family studies , twin studies , association studies , genome-wide linkage studies and genome-wide association scan ( GWAs ) reporting different physical activity/inactivity-related phenotypes . In regards to PA , familial aggregation studies resulted in heritability estimates ranging from 0 to 60 % , and twin studies yielded heritability estimates ( a(2) ) and shared environment ( c(2) ) scores for PA phenotypes ranging from 0.00 to 0.85 and 0.00 to 0.84 , respectively . Unique environmental ( e(2) ) results are well dispersed from 0.12 to 0.72 . Suggestive linkages were found with markers nearby different activity-related genes : P24530 , P32245 , P25874 , P12104 , P41180 , Q8IVB4 . Significant associations with PA phenotypes were found for Ace , Gln223ARrg , P32245 and P14416 genes . We found one GWAs that reported novel SNPs in the O95340 gene on chromosome 10q23.2 and in two intergenic regions on chromosomes 2q33.1 and 18p11.32 . Heritability estimates for PI ranged from 25 to 60 % and linkage studies recorded higher LOD scores for PI versus PA . The P12821 genotype was strongly associated with PI . There are potentially different genetic influences on PA versus PI phenotypes . Future studies should focus on the different genetic influences on PA and PI to improve our understanding of underlying determinants of these behaviors .
