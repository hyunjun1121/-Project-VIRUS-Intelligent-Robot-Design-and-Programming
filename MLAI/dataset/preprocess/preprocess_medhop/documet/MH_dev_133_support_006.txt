Receptor cross-talk spatially restricts p- P29323 during O00206 stimulation of autoreactive B cells . To maintain tolerance , autoreactive B cells must regulate signal transduction from the P11274 and TLRs . We recently identified that dendritic cells and macrophages regulate autoreactive cells during O00206 activation by releasing P05231 and soluble P29965 ( sCD40L ) . These cytokines selectively repress Ab secretion from autoreactive , but not antigenically naive , B cells . How P05231 and sCD40L repress autoantibody production is unknown . In this work , we show that P05231 and sCD40L are required for low-affinity/avidity autoreactive B cells to maintain tolerance through a mechanism involving receptor cross-talk between the P11274 , O00206 , and the IL-6R or P25942 . We show that acute signaling through IL-6R or P25942 integrates with chronic P11274 -mediated P29323 activation to restrict p- P29323 from the nucleus and represses O00206 -induced Blimp-1 and P17861 expression . Tolerance is disrupted in 2-12H/MRL/lpr mice where P05231 and sCD40L fail to spatially restrict p- P29323 and fail to repress O00206 -induced Ig secretion . In the case of P25942 , acute signaling in B cells from 2-12H/MRL/lpr mice is intact , but the chronic activation of p- P29323 emanating from the P11274 is attenuated . Re-establishing chronically active P29323 through retroviral expression of constitutively active Q02750 restores tolerance upon sCD40L , but not P05231 , stimulation , indicating that regulation by P05231 requires another signaling effector . These data define the molecular basis for the regulation of low-affinity autoreactive B cells during O00206 stimulation ; they explain how autoreactive but not naive B cells are repressed by P05231 and sCD40L ; and they identify B cell defects in lupus-prone mice that lead to O00206 -induced autoantibody production .
