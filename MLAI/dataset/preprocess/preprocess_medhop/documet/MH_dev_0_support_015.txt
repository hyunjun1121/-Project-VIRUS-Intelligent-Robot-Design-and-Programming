Technology evaluation : DB06101 , ImClone Systems . ImClone is developing IMC-IC11 , an anti-angiogenesis chimeric monoclonal antibody specific vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( P35968 , also known Flk-1 in mice ) , for the potential treatment of cancer [ 156625 ] ; it in phase I trials for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma [ 379143 ] . The related antibody DC-101 provided proof-of-principle that an anti- P15692 receptor antibody could strongly inhibit tumor growth and even cause tumor regression with the glioblastoma tumor cell line , GBM18 [ 388236 ] . In May 1998 , the company was granted US-05747651 by the USPTO , covering antibodies against the extracellular portion of the P35968 / P35968 receptor [ 284054 ] .
