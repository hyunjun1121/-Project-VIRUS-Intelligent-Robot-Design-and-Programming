Epidermal growth factor enhances androgen receptorâ€‘mediated bladder cancer progression and invasion via potentiation of AR transactivation . P10275 ( AR ) plays a critical role in bladder cancer ( BCa ) development . Our early studies found AR knock-out mice ( with few androgens and deleted AR ) failed to develop BCa , yet 50 % of castrated mice ( with few androgens and existing AR ) still developed BCa in an N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine ( BBN ) carcinogen-induced BCa mouse model , suggesting the existing AR in BCa of castrated mice may still play important roles in promoting BCa development at the castration level of androgens . The mechanism underlying this and/or which factors potentiate AR function at the castration level of androgen remains unclear . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , a key player in BCa progression , has been demonstrated to be able to potentiate AR transactivation in prostate cancer . In the present study , we found that P01133 could increase BCa cell growth , migration and invasion in the presence of AR under the low amount of androgen and P01133 was able to potentiate AR transactivation through P00533 by activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway at castration androgen level . The increased suppression effects by P00533 inhibitor of PD168393 on AR function after addition of anti-androgen , DB01128 , further suggested AR might play a key role in the effects of P01133 on BCa progression and metastasis . Collectively , our results indicate that P01133 may be able to potentiate AR transactivation that leads to enhancing BCa progression , which may help us to develop a better therapeutic approach to treat BCa via targeting both P01133 and AR signaling .
