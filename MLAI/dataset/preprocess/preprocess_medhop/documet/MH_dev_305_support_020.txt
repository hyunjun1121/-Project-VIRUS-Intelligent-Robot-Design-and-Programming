Factors regulating insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 binding , processing , and potentiation of insulin-like growth factor action . In this study , we investigated the effects of various biochemical and pharmacological agents on insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) cell binding and action in cultured bovine fibroblasts . When cells were preincubated for 48 h with 50 nM recombinant human ( rh ) P17936 , P05019 -stimulated [3H]aminoisobutyric acid ( [125H]AIB ) uptake was enhanced 2- to 3-fold . The addition of cytoskeletal disrupting agents during the preincubation with DB05897 did not affect P17936 potentiation of P05019 action , nor did a variety of serine , aspartate , and metalloproteinase inhibitors . On the other hand , ammonium chloride and chloroquine , weak bases that neutralize the pH of acidic cell compartments , blocked P17936 potentiation of P05019 -stimulated [3H]AIB uptake . Chloroquine and ammonium chloride had no effect alone and did not inhibit P08069 binding or action in the absence of DB05897 . Bafilomycin A , a specific inhibitor of DB00171 -dependent hydrogen ion pumps , also inhibited P17936 potentiation of P05019 -stimulated [3H]AIB uptake . Competitive [125I] P05019 binding and affinity cross-linking experiments suggested structure/function changes in cell-bound P17936 that were altered in the presence of chloroquine and bafilomycin . DB01109 markedly decreased initial P17936 cell adherence , but could not promote dissociation of P17936 from cells after the 48-h preincubation . Moreover , heparin did not inhibit P17936 potentiation of P05019 action . In summary , these data indicate that P17936 undergoes specific pH-dependent structural and/or environmental modifications that mediate the enhancing effect of P17936 on P05019 action in bovine fibroblasts . They also suggest that P17936 binding to heparin-like molecules on the cell surface is not directly involved in this process .
