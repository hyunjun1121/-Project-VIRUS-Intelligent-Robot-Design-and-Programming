Chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor negatively regulates hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase . Hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase catalyzing bile acid sulfation plays an essential role in protection against lithocholic acid ( LCA ) -induced liver toxicity . Hepatic levels of Sult2a is up to 8-fold higher in farnesoid X receptor-null mice than in the wild-type mice . Thus , the influence of Q96RI1 ligand ( chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) and LCA ) feeding on hepatic Sult2a expression was examined in Q96RI1 -null and wild-type mice . Hepatic Sult2a protein content was elevated in Q96RI1 -null and wild-type mice fed a LCA ( 1 % and 0.5 % ) diet . Treatment with 0.5 % DB06777 diet decreased hepatic Sult2a to 20 % of the control in wild-type mice , but increased the content in Q96RI1 -null mice . Liver Sult2a1 ( St2a4 ) mRNA levels were reduced to 26 % in wild-type mice after feeding of a DB06777 diet , while no decrease was observed on Sult2a1 mRNA levels in Q96RI1 -null mice after DB06777 feeding . A significant inverse relationship ( r(2)=0.523 ) was found between hepatic Sult2a protein content and small heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) mRNA level . Q15149 -mediated increase in Sult2a protein levels were attenuated by DB06777 feeding in wild-type mice , but not in Q96RI1 -null mice . Human Q06520 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in HepG2 cells treated with the Q96RI1 agonists , DB06777 or GW4064 in dose-dependent manners , although Q15466 mRNA levels were increased . These results suggest that SULT2A is negatively regulated through DB06777 -mediated Q96RI1 activation in mice and humans .
