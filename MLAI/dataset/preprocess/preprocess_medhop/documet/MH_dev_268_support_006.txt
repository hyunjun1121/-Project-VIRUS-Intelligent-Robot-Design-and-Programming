RNA-seq reveals determinants of sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in esophageal carcinoma cells . Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with incurable disease of esophageal carcinoma . Most patients respond poorly to chemotherapy , it is necessary to figure out biomarkers for chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance to perform the individualized therapy . In present work , the sensitivities of two ESCC cell lines to 9 chemotherapy drugs were identified and the transcriptome of these two cell lines were investigated by RNA-seq , the correlation between the sensitivity to drugs and expression of some genes was attempted to construct . Eca-1 was more resistant to most of the chemotherapy drugs than Eca-109 cell line . RNA-seq results showed that there is dramatic difference in the basal expression between these two ESCC cell lines . Pathway analysis demonstrated that these differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Gαi signaling , calcium signaling , DB02527 -mediated signaling , G-protein coupled receptor signaling and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways . The molecules in Gαi signaling ( Q08828 and P32745 ) and actin cytoskeleton signaling ( P13533 and P12883 ) were highly expressed in multidrug-resistant Eca-1 cells , which were validated by quantitative PCR . Activation of these two pathways results in the upregulation of downstream signaling , PKA signaling and Src- P40763 , and downregulation of RAF- P29323 signaling , which was validated by immunoblotting experiments . Our work proposed that activation of Gαi signaling or actin cytoskeleton signaling may confer ESCC cells resistance to most chemotherapy drugs . Our work might provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for treatment of EC patients .
