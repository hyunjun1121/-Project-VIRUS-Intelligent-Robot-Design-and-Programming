Induction of G2 arrest and binding to cyclophilin A are independent phenotypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr . P62937 ( CypA ) is a member of a family of cellular proteins that share a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) activity . CypA was previously reported to be required for the biochemical stability and function ( specifically , induction of G2 arrest ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) protein R ( Vpr ) . In the present study , we examine the role of the Vpr-CypA interaction on Vpr-induced G2 arrest . We find that Vpr coimmunoprecipitates with CypA and that this interaction is disrupted by substitution of proline-35 of Vpr as well as incubation with the CypA inhibitor cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) . Surprisingly , the presence of CypA or its binding to Vpr is dispensable for the ability of Vpr to induce G2 arrest . Vpr expression in CypA-/- cells leads to induction of G2 arrest in a manner that is indistinguishable from that in CypA+ cells . DB00091 abolished CypA-Vpr binding but had no effect on induction of G2 arrest or Vpr steady-state levels . In view of these results , we propose that the interaction with CypA is independent of the ability of Vpr to induce cell cycle arrest . The interaction between Vpr and CypA is intriguing , and further studies should examine its potential effects on other functions of Vpr .
