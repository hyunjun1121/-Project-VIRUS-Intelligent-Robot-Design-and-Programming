Algorithm for the management of metastatic cutaneous melanoma . Over the last 4 years , various drugs have been approved for the treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma . DB06186 , an anti- P16410 inhibitor that stimulates antitumor immunity , was the first agent to improve overall survival both in first line and in previously treated patients . DB06186 results in long term disease control in approximately 20 % of the patients . DB08881 was the first P15056 inhibitor ( BRAFi ) approved and also resulted in improved overall survival compared with dacarbazine in patients with P15056 mutated metastatic melanoma . More recently , another BRAFi , dabrafenib , and a MEK inhibitor , trametinib , were approved either alone or in combination as they each showed significant antitumor activity relative to dacarbazine and the combination appeared superior to dabrafenib monotherapy . The major feature of such tumor targeted therapy is its high response rate ( 40-70 % ) and the rapidity of the responses , resulting in prompt clinical improvement . However , unlike immunotherapy , targeted therapy does not result in long-term treatment free survival . In this paper , we discuss how best to integrate the currently available treatment options including high-dose interleukin-2 ( HD P60568 ) , systemic chemotherapy , ipilimumab and tumor targeted therapy in various clinical scenarios .
