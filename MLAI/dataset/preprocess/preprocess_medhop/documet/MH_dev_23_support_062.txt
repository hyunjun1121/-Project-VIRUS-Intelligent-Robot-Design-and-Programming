Activation status of receptor tyrosine kinase downstream pathways in primary lung adenocarcinoma with reference of P01116 and P00533 mutations . The activation status of signal transduction pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases and its association with P00533 or P01116 mutations have been widely studied using cancer cell lines , although it is still uncertain in primary tumors . To study the activation status of main components of growth factor-induced pathways , phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( pERK ) and other downstream proteins were immunohistochemically examined using surgical samples of 193 primary lung adenocarcinomas . Also , thyroid transcription factor-1 ( Q15669 -1 ) expression and mutation status of P00533 and P01116 were examined . Advanced tumor stages ( p < 0.001 ) , negative Q15669 -1 expression ( p < 0.001 ) and Akt activation ( p=0.015 ) were independent and significant poor prognostic markers . Akt activation related to advanced stage ( p=0.021 ) , invasiveness ( p=0.004 ) , and not to mutations . Q15669 -1 expression associated with never-smoker ( p=0.013 ) , pre- or minimally invasiveness ( p < 0.001 ) and P00533 mutations ( p=0.017 ) as well as with pERK ( p=0.039 ) expression . P00533 mutations did not correlated with pAkt and pERK expression , which was different from the results based on cultured cells , while P01116 mutations were solely and significantly linked to P29323 activation ( p=0.009 ) . In lung adenocarcinoma , tumors with Q15669 -1 expression have distinct characteristics regarding mutations , signal protein activation and clinical issues . Moreover , this property was revealed to be important in outcome estimation at any tumor stage , whereas Akt activation is abnormally affected according to the tumor stage regardless of their cell origin . The signal proteins were differently related to mutation status from cultured cells .
