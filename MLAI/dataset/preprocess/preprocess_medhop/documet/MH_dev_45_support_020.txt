P50591 -activated stress kinases suppress apoptosis through transcriptional upregulation of Q8WXI8 -1 . P01375 -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( P50591 ) is a potentially useful anticancer agent with exquisite selectivity for cancer cells . Unfortunately , many cancers show or acquire resistance to P50591 . In this study we report that P50591 activates a O43318 --> mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) kinase 3 ( P46734 ) / P52564 --> p38 pathway in prostate cancer cells that transcriptionally upregulates expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member Q8WXI8 -1 . P50591 alone triggered robust formation of the ' death-inducing signaling complex ' ( DISC ) , activation of the initiator caspase-8 , and truncation of the Q7L3V2 P55957 ( tBID ) . Nevertheless , simultaneous disruption of the p38 MAPK pathway was required to suppress Q8WXI8 -1 expression , thereby allowing tBID to activate the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member Q16611 and stimulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ( MOMP ) . Release of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis ( IAP ) antagonist , Q9NR28 / Q9NR28 , from the intermembrane space was sufficient to promote P50591 -induced apoptosis , whereas release of cytochrome c and activation of the apoptosome was dispensable . Even after MOMP , however , mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) activated a secondary signaling pathway , involving c-Jun N-terminal kinases ( JNKs ) , that similarly upregulated Q8WXI8 -1 expression and partially rescued some cells from death . Thus , stress kinases activated at distinct steps , before and after mitochondrial injury , mediate P50591 resistance through maintenance of Q8WXI8 -1 expression .
