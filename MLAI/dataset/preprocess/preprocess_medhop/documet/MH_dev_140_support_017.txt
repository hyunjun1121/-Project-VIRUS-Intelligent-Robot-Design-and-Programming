Inhibition of proliferation and migration of luminal and claudin-low breast cancer cells by P09619 inhibitors . BACKGROUND : Platelet-derived growth factors ( PDGFs ) bind to two receptors , PDGFRα and PDGFRβ to mediate cell proliferation , migration and survival . Although epithelial cells typically do not express high levels of PDGFRs , their expression has been reported to increase in breast cancer cells that have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition . METHODS : P09619 signaling was inhibited using DB01268 malate , Imatinib mesylate or DB08896 in murine and human luminal-like and claudin-low mammary tumor cell lines or Masitinib in only the human cell lines . A scratch wound assay was used to assess tumor cell migration while immunofluorescence for phosphorylated histone H3 or cleaved caspase 3 was used to determine tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis , respectively . RESULTS : DB01268 and DB08896 , but not Imatinib , were capable of significantly inhibiting the migration of both murine and human luminal-like and claudin-low breast cancer cells while Masitinib inhibited migration in both human breast cancer cell lines . DB01268 but not DB08896 or Imatinib also significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation in all four cell lines tested while Masitinib had no significant effect on human breast cancer cell proliferation . None of the P09619 inhibitors consistently regulated mammary tumor cell apoptosis . CONCLUSION : DB01268 , DB08896 and Masitinib may prove clinically useful in inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and metastasis while only DB01268 ( and possibly DB08896 in some breast cancer subtypes ) is effective at inhibiting both migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells .
