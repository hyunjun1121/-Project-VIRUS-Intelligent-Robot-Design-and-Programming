Structural studies with inhibitors of the cell cycle regulatory kinase cyclin-dependent protein kinase 2 . Components of the cell cycle machinery are frequently altered in cancer . Many of these alterations affect the cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) and their regulation . DB02010 and 7-hydroxystaurosporine ( P55089 -01 ) are two natural product kinase inhibitors originally identified as potent protein kinase C inhibitors . DB02010 is non-selective and too toxic for use in therapy , but P55089 -01 shows greater selectivity , and is in clinical trials . We have determined the crystal structures of staurosporine bound to monomeric P24941 and P55089 -01 bound to active phospho- P24941 /cyclin A . Both compounds mimic the hydrogen bonds made by the adenine moiety of DB00171 , and both exploit the non-polar nature of the adenine-binding site . In the complex with P55089 -01 , a hydrogen-bonded water molecule is incorporated into the non-polar cavity , which provides a partial polar character in the environment of the 7-hydroxyl group . Comparison of the DB00171 -binding site of P24941 with that of other kinases reveals that in Chk1 kinase , a major target for P55089 -01 in the cell , one of the surrounding residues , Ala144 in P24941 , is a serine in Chk1 , thus providing a possible explanation for the effectiveness of P55089 -01 against this kinase . For cells to exit mitosis , the CDKs must be completely inactivated , firstly by the ubiquintin-mediated destruction of the cyclins , followed by dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr160 ( in P24941 ) catalysed by the kinase-associated phosphatase and protein phosphatase 2C . We describe the structure of phospho- P24941 in complex with kinase-associated phosphatase , and discuss the substrate recognition promoted by interactions that are remote from the catalytic site .
