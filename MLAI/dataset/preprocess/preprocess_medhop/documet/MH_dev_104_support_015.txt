Catalog of 178 variations in the Japanese population among eight human genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . We screened DNAs from 48 Japanese individuals for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in eight genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by directly sequencing the entire relevant genomic regions except for repetitive-sequence elements . This approach identified 147 SNPs and 31 insertion/deletion polymorphisms among the eight GPCR genes . On average , we identified one SNP in every 584 nucleotides . Of the 147 SNPs , 69 were identified in P30556 , 12 in P50052 , nine in P35414 , 20 in P37288 , nine in P30518 , 16 in P21728 , six in P08514 , and six in P43119 . Twenty-one SNPs were located in 5' flanking regions , 76 in introns , 32 in exons , and 18 in 3' flanking regions . These variants should contribute to investigations of possible correlations between genotypes and phenotypes as regards susceptibility to disease or responsiveness to drug therapy .
