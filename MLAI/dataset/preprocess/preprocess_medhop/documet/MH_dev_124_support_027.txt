1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol enhances butyrate-induced P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) expression . Butyrate , a short-chain fatty acid produced in the colon , as well as its prodrug tributyrin , reduce proliferation and increase differentiation of colon cancer cells . P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) are negative regulators of cell cycle and are thought to have a key function in the differentiation of various cell lines . We studied the effects of butyrate on differentiation , P11473 expression , as well as on P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) expression in human colon cancer cells ( Caco-2 ) . Butyrate induced cell differentiation , which was further enhanced after addition of DB00136 . Synergistic effect of butyrate and dihydroxycholecalciferol in Caco-2 cells was due to butyrate-induced overexpression of P11473 . While butyrate as well as dihydroxycholecalciferol increased P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) expression , in contrast combined exposure of butyrate and dihydroxycholecalciferol resulted in a synergistic amplification of P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) , but not of p27(Kip1) expression . These data imply that butyrate selectively increases P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) expression via upregulation of P11473 in Caco-2 cells .
