Spinal cord injury induces early and persistent lesional Q99571 receptor expression . Following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , neuropathic , chronic pain is a major cause of disability . Recently , glial Q99571 receptor ( P2X4R ) has been identified as a major contributor to the development of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury . Here we report analysis of P2X4R expression following rat SCI . Significant lesional accumulation of P2X4R+ cells was detected as early as 24 h after SCI , reaching maximum cell numbers on Day 7 . Thereafter cell numbers declined but persisted at significantly elevated , sub-maximal levels ( > 70 % ) until 1 month post injury . Double-immunolabeling identified the majority of lesional P2X4R+ cells as activated microglia/macrophages and surviving neurons/neurites . Increase of P2X4R+ , beta- P05067 + hypertrophic neurites correlated with proximity to the lesion . Further , P2X4R+ cells coexpressed the intracellular regulators of signalling cascades , P23219 ( > 20 % ) , P35354 ( > 5 % ) , RhoA ( > 60 % ) and RhoB ( > 10 % ) .
