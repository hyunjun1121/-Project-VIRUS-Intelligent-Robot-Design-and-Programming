DB02342 causes functional repression of transforming growth factor β3 signaling by ameliorating Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways in immortalized uterine fibroid cells . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effects and the mechanism of action of 2-methoxyestradiol ( 2ME(2) ) on transforming growth factor ( TGF ) β3-induced profibrotic response in immortalized human uterine fibroid smooth muscle ( huLM ) cells . DESIGN : Laboratory study . SETTING : University research laboratory . PATIENTS(S) : Not applicable . INTERVENTIONS(S) : Not applicable . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : huLM cells were treated with TGF-β3 ( 5 ηg/mL ) in the presence or absence of specific P84022 inhibitor SIS3 ( 1 μmol/L ) , inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt ( LY294002 , 10 μmol/L ) , or 2ME(2) ( 0.5 μmol/L ) , and the expression of collagen ( Col ) type I(αI) , Col III(αI) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) 1 , connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ) , and α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) were determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting . The effect of 2ME(2) on Smad-microtubule binding was evaluated by coimmunoprecipitation . RESULT(S) : Our data revealed that TGF-β3-induced fibrogenic response in huLM is mediated by both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent PI3K/Akt/ P42345 signaling pathways . 2ME(2) abrogates TGF-β3-induced expression of Col I(αI) , Col III(αI) , P05121 , P29279 , and α-SMA . Molecularly , 2ME(2) ameliorates TGF-β3-induced Q15796 /3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation . In addition , 2ME(2) inhibits TGF-β3-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/ P42345 pathway . CONCLUSION(S) : TGF-β3-induced profibrotic response in fibroid cells is mediated by Smad-dependent and Smad-independent PI3K/Akt/ P42345 pathways . 2ME(2) inhibits TGF-β3 profibrotic effects in huLM cells by ameliorating both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signaling pathways .
