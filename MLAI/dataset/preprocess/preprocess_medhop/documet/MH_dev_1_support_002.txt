Endothelial dihydrofolate reductase : critical for nitric oxide bioavailability and role in angiotensin II uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase . Recent studies demonstrate that oxidative inactivation of tetrahydrobiopterin ( H4B ) may cause uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) to produce superoxide ( O2*- ) . H4B was found recyclable from its oxidized form by dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) in several cell types . Functionality of the endothelial P00374 , however , remains completely unknown . Here we present findings that specific inhibition of endothelial P00374 by RNA interference markedly reduced endothelial H4B and nitric oxide ( NO. ) bioavailability . Furthermore , angiotensin II ( 100 nmol/liter for 24 h ) caused a H4B deficiency that was mediated by H2O2-dependent down-regulation of P00374 . This response was associated with a significant increase in endothelial O2*- production , which was abolished by P29474 inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester or H2O2 scavenger polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase , strongly suggesting H2O2-dependent P29474 uncoupling . Rapid and transient activation of endothelial NAD(P)H oxidases was responsible for the initial burst production of O2* ( Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 but not an N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester-attenuated P03372 O2*- signal at 30 min ) in response to angiotensin II , preceding a second peak in O2*- production at 24 h that predominantly depended on uncoupled P29474 . Overexpression of P00374 restored NO. production and diminished P29474 production of O2*- in angiotensin II-stimulated cells . In conclusion , these data represent evidence that P00374 is critical for H4B and NO. bioavailability in the endothelium . Endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase-derived H2O2 down-regulates P00374 expression in response to angiotensin II , resulting in H4B deficiency and uncoupling of P29474 . This signaling cascade may represent a universal mechanism underlying P29474 dysfunction under pathophysiological conditions associated with oxidant stress .
