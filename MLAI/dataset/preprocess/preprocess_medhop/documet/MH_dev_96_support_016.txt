Involvement of the Q99572 purinergic receptor and c-Jun N-terminal and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2 induction by LL-37 . Periodontal disease is caused by microorganisms and host-derived inflammation involving increased cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) production . We previously demonstrated that human β-defensin-3 induces P35354 and PGE(2) in human gingival fibroblasts ( HGFs ) . We , therefore , aimed to examine the inducible effects of LL-37 , the only cathelicidin expressed in humans , on P35354 expression and PGE(2) synthesis in HGFs and to elucidate the relevant signaling pathways . The P35354 expression was upregulated by LL-37 in dose- and time-dependent manners . Accordingly , the synthesis of PGE(2) in cell-free culture supernatants was raised by LL-37 ( p < 0.01 ) and blocked by NS-398 , a specific P35354 inhibitor ( p < 0.01 ) . P2X inhibitors and a neutralizing antibody against P2X(7) purinergic receptor significantly abrogated P35354 induction and PGE(2) production by LL-37 ( p < 0.01 ) . LL-37 upregulated P35354 expression and PGE(2) synthesis via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and Q9BY77 c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , while interleukin-1β did so via nuclear factor-ĸB and all three mitogen-activated protein kinases . In summary , LL-37 can control arachidonic acid metabolism by induction of P35354 expression and PGE(2) synthesis via the P2X(7) receptor , P29323 , and Q9BY77 JNK . The pro-inflammatory effects of LL-37 may be essential for initiating oral mucosal inflammation in periodontal disease .
