Boosting the sampling efficiency of q-Ball imaging using multiple wavevector fusion . q-Ball imaging ( QBI ) is a high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging ( HARDI ) method that is capable of resolving complex , subvoxel white matter ( WM ) architecture . QBI requires time-intensive sampling of the diffusion signal and large diffusion wavevectors . Here we describe a reconstruction scheme for QBI , termed multiple wavevector fusion ( MWF ) , that substantially boosts the sampling efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) of QBI . The MWF reconstruction operates by nonlinearly fusing the diffusion signal from separate low and high wavevector acquisitions . The combination of wavevectors provides the benefits of the high SNR of the low wavevector signal and the high angular contrast-to-noise ratio ( P21554 ) and peak separation of the high wavevector signal . The MWF procedure provides a framework for combining diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) and QBI . Numerical simulations show that MWF of DTI and QBI provides a more accurate estimate of the diffusion orientation distribution function ( O14788 ) than QBI alone . The accuracy improvement can be translated into an efficiency gain of 274-377 % . An intravoxel peak connectivity metric ( IPCM ) is presented that calculates the peak connectivity between an O14788 and its neighboring voxels . In human WM , MWF reveals more detailed WM architecture than QBI as measured by the IPCM for all sampling schemes presented .
