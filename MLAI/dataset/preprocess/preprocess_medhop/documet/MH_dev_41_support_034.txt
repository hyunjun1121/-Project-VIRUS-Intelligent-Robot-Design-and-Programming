The transcriptional coactivator DRIP/mediator complex is involved in vitamin D receptor function and regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . Mediator is a multisubunit coactivator complex that facilitates transcription of nuclear receptors . We investigated the role of the mediator complex as a coactivator for vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in keratinocytes . Using P11473 affinity beads , the vitamin D receptor interacting protein ( DRIP ) /mediator complex was purified from primary keratinocytes , and its subunit composition was determined by mass spectrometry . The complex included core subunits , such as Q15648 /MED1 ( MED1 ) , that directly binds to P11473 . Additional subunits were identified that are components of the RNA polymerase II complex . The functions of different mediator components were investigated by silencing its subunits . The core subunit MED1 facilitates P11473 activity and regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation . A newly described subunit Q13503 also has a role in promoting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation , whereas Q9BTT4 has an inhibitory role . Blocking MED1/ Q13503 expression caused hyperproliferation of keratinocytes , accompanied by increases in mRNA expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 and/or glioma-associated oncogene homolog . Blocking MED1 or Q13503 expression also resulted in defects in calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation , as indicated by decreased expression of differentiation markers and decreased translocation of P12830 to the membrane . These results show that keratinocytes use the transcriptional coactivator mediator to regulate P11473 functions and control keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation .
