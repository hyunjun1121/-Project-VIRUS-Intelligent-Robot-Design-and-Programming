A new P04035 inhibitor , pitavastatin remarkably retards the progression of high cholesterol induced atherosclerosis in rabbits . BACKGROUND : The remarkable anti-atherosclerotic effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl- DB01992 reductase inhibitor have not been demonstrated in diet induced severe hyperlipidemia in rabbit model . OBJECTIVE : We have investigated the effect of pitavastatin , a newly developed statin , on atherosclerosis in rabbits . METHODS AND RESULTS : Oophorectomized female NZW rabbits were fed 0.3 % cholesterol chow for 12 weeks with or without pitavastatin ( 0.1mg/kg per day ) ( Gp.NK and HCD ) . The level of serum cholesterol was decreased in Gp.NK compared with Gp.HCD ( 772.8 +/- 70.2 versus 1056.9 +/- 108.3 mg/d ) , whereas no significant alterations were observed in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol . NO dependent response stimulated by acetylcholine and calcium ionophore A23187 and tone related basal NO response induced by N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate were all improved by pitavastatin treatment . DB08860 treatment increased the level of cyclic GMP in the aorta of cholesterol fed rabbits . In the aorta , the expression of P29474 mRNA was significantly up regulated and O(2)(-) production was slightly reduced in Gp.NK animals . Atherosclerotic area was significantly decreased in aortic arch and thoracic aorta from Gp.NK compared with those from Gp.HCD ( 15.1 +/- 5.3 versus 41.9 +/- 10.2 % , 3.1 +/- 1.1versus 7.9 +/- 1.2 % in Gp.NK and Gp.HCD aortic arch and thoracic aorta ) . Anti-macrophage staining area , the P03956 or 2 and the nitrotyrosine positive area were decreased in Gp.NK . CONCLUSION : DB08860 retards the progression of atherosclerosis formation and it improves NO bioavailability by P29474 up-regulation and decrease of O(2)(-) .
