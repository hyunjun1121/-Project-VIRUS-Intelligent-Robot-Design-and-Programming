Shear stress-mediated F1/FO DB00171 synthase-dependent CO2 gas excretion from human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells . We studied the physiological role of flow through pulmonary arterioles in CO(2) gas exchange . We established human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells ( HPAoEC ) . The cells demonstrated marked immunocytochemical staining of P16284 , P15692 R2 , P12821 -1 , and CA type IV on their cell surface . Ten seconds shear stress stimulation caused the co-release of H(+) and DB00171 via the activation of F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase on the HPAoEC . F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase was immunocytochemically observed on the cell surface of non-permeabilized HPAoEC . In the shear stress-loaded HPAoEC culture media supernatant , ATPase activity increased in a time-dependent manner . The HPAoEC were strongly stained for P49961 , which partially co-localized with purinergic P47900 . The purinergic P47900 receptor agonist UTP ( 10(-6) M ) significantly potentiated the shear stress-induced increase in ATPase activity in the culture medium supernatant . Ten seconds shear stress stimulation also produced stress strength-dependent CO(2) gas excretion from the HPAoEC , which was significantly reduced by the inhibition of F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase or CA IV on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface . In conclusion , we have proposed a new concept of CO(2) exchange in the human lung , flow-mediated F(1)/F(O) DB00171 synthase-dependent H(+) secretion , resulting in the facilitation of a dehydration reaction involving HCO3(-) in plasma and the excretion of CO(2) gas from arteriolar ECs .
