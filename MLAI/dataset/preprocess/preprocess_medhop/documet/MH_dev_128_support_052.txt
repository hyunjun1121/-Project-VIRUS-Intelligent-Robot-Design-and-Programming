Genetics of alcoholism . DB00898 use and alcohol use disorders are substantially heritable . Variants in genes coding for alcohol metabolic enzymes have long been known to influence consumption . More recent studies in family-based samples have implicated P47869 , nicotinic receptor genes such as Q05901 , and a number of other specific single genes as associated with alcohol use disorders . The growing use of genetic analyses , in particular studies using polygenic risk scores ; neurobiologic pathways ; and methods for quantifying gene × gene and gene × environment interactions have also contributed to an evolving understanding of the genetic architecture of alcohol use disorders . Additionally , the study of behavioral traits associated with alcohol dependence such as impulsivity and sensation seeking , and the influences of demographic factors ( i.e. , sex and ethnicity ) have significantly enhanced the genetics of alcoholism literature . This article provides a brief overview of the current topically relevant findings in the field to date and includes areas of research still requiring attention .
