Pharmacogenetics in cancer treatment . Interindividual variability in the efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy is associated with polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes , transporters , or drug targets . Pharmacogenetics aims to identify individuals predisposed to high risk of toxicity from conventional doses of cancer chemotherapeutic agents . We review the role of genetic polymorphisms in P22309 and P51580 , as well as mutations in Q12882 , in influencing drug disposition and toxicity . Recent studies show that pharmacogenetic determinants may also influence treatment outcomes . We discuss the clinical significance of polymorphisms in TS , P42898 , and P08637 , as well as the polymorphic DNA repair genes P18074 and P18887 , in influencing response to chemotherapy and survival outcomes . Finally , the potential implications of transporter pharmacogenetics in influencing drug bioavailability are addressed .
