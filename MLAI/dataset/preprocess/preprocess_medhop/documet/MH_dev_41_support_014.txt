Quantifying Lipari-Szabo modelfree parameters from 13CO NMR relaxation experiments . It is proposed to obtain effective Lipari-Szabo order parameters and local correlation times for relaxation vectors of protein (13)CO nuclei by carrying out a (13)CO-R(1) auto relaxation experiment , a transverse (13)CO Q13216 /13CO-13Calpha Q13216 /dipolar cross correlation and a transverse (13)CO Q13216 /(13)CO-(15)N Q13216 /dipolar cross correlation experiment . Given the global rotational correlation time from (15)N relaxation experiments , a new program COMFORD ( CO-Modelfree Fitting Of Relaxation Data ) is presented to fit the (13)CO data to an effective order parameter S2CO , an effective local correlation time and the orientation of the Q13216 tensor with respect to the molecular frame . It is shown that the effective S2CO is least sensitive to rotational fluctuations about an imaginary Calpha-Calpha axis and most sensitive to rotational fluctuations about an imaginary axis parallel to the NH bond direction . As such , the Calpha-Calpha information is fully complementary to the (15)N relaxation order parameter , which is least sensitive to fluctuations about the NH axis and most sensitive to fluctuations about the Calpha-Calpha axis . The new paradigm is applied on data of Ca(2+) saturated P62158 , and on available literature data for Ubiquitin . Our data indicate that the S2CO order parameters rapport on slower , and sometimes different , motions than the (15)N relaxation order parameters . The CO local correlation times correlate well with the calmodulin 's secondary structure .
