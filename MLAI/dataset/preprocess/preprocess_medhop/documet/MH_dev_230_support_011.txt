The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)4-receptor agonist RS67506 enhances lower intestinal propulsion in mice . Interactions of gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 and Q13639 receptors and the relation to their effects on gastrointestinal propulsion were investigated . DB04917 and zacopride potently inhibited 5- Q9H205 -receptor-mediated contractions in the guinea pig colon , whereas RS67506 ( 1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-3- [ 1- ( 2-methyl sulphonylamino ) ethyl-4-piperidinyl ] -1-propanone hydrochloride ) , a selective Q13639 -receptor agonist , showed no inhibition . RS67506 , renzapride and zacopride all exerted Q13639 receptor-mediated relaxation in the carbachol-precontracted rat oesophagus . In mice , RS67506 shortened the whole gut transit time , whereas renzapride and zacopride were reported to prolong it . Gastrointestinal prokinetic benzamides , which are selective for Q13639 -receptor agonistic over 5- Q9H205 -receptor antagonistic action , may be useful in treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with impaired lower intestinal propulsion such as constipation .
