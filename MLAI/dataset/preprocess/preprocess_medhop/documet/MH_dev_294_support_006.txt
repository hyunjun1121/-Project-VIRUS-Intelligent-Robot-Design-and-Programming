Endoplasmic reticulum calcium depletion impacts chaperone secretion , innate immunity , and phagocytic uptake of cells . A number of immunological functions are ascribed to cell surface-expressed forms of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) chaperone calreticulin ( CRT ) . In this study , we examined the impact of ER stress-inducing drugs upon cell surface CRT induction and the resulting immunological consequences . We showed that cell surface expression of CRT and secretion of CRT , P11021 , gp96 , and P07237 were induced by thapsigargin ( THP ) treatment , which depletes ER calcium , but not by tunicamycin treatment , which inhibits protein glycosylation . Surface expression of CRT in viable , THP-treated fibroblasts correlated with their enhanced phagocytic uptake by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells . Incubation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with THP-treated fibroblasts enhanced sterile P05231 production and LPS-induced generation of IL-1β , IL-12 , IL-23 , and P01375 -α . However , extracellular CRT is not required for enhanced proinflammatory responses . Furthermore , the pattern of proinflammatory cytokine induction by THP-treated cells and cell supernatants resembled that induced by THP itself and indicated that other ER chaperones present in supernatants of THP-treated cells also do not contribute to induction of the innate immune response . Thus , secretion of various ER chaperones , including CRT , is induced by ER calcium depletion . CRT , previously suggested as an eat-me signal in dead and dying cellular contexts , can also promote phagocytic uptake of cells subject to ER calcium depletion . Finally , there is a strong synergy between calcium depletion in the ER and sterile P05231 , as well as LPS-dependent IL-1β , IL-12 , IL-23 , and P01375 -α innate responses , findings that have implications for understanding inflammatory diseases that originate in the ER .
