Molecular mechanisms of low dose ionizing radiation-induced hormesis , adaptive responses , radioresistance , bystander effects , and genomic instability . PURPOSES : To review research progress on the molecular mechanisms of low dose ionizing radiation ( LDIR ) -induced hormesis , adaptive responses , radioresistance , bystander effects , and genomic instability in order to provide clues for therapeutic approaches to enhance biopositive effects ( defined as radiation-induced beneficial effects to the organism ) , and control bionegative effects ( defined as radiation-induced harmful effects to the organism ) and related human diseases . CONCLUSIONS : Experimental studies have indicated that Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated ( Q13315 ) , extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and protein 53 ( P04637 ) -related signal transduction pathways may be involved in LDIR-induced hormesis ; MAPK , P04637 may be important for adaptive response ; Q13315 , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , P29323 , JNK , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , P04637 for radioresistance ; P35354 , P29323 , MAPK , ROS , tumor necrosis factor receptor alpha ( TNFα ) for LDIR-induced bystander effect ; whereas Q13315 , P29323 , MAPK , P04637 , ROS , TNFα-related signal transduction pathways are involved in LDIR-induced genomic instability . These results suggest that different manifestations of LDIR-induced cellular responses may have different signal transduction pathways . On the other hand , LDIR-induced different responses may also share the same signal transduction pathways . For instance , P04637 has been involved in LDIR-induced hormesis , adaptive response , radioresistance and genomic instability . Current data therefore suggest that caution should be taken when designing therapeutic approaches using LDIR to induce beneficial effects in humans .
