Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents -- XVII . Spiro[piperidine-4',1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline)] as a probe defining the extended topographic model of P08908 receptors . Spiro[piperidine-4',1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline)] ( 10 ) , its derivatives 11-15 and its analogs 16 and 17 were examined as ligands of serotonin P08908 receptors . It was shown that compounds 12 and 14 had essentially the same P08908 affinity as 1-phenylpiperazine and its rigid analog 7 , whereas there were substantial differences in the steric arrangement of their crucial pharmacophores , i.e. aromatic and protonation centers . On the basis of the existing models and using the DB04829 structure as a template , a new , extended three-point topographic model of P08908 receptors has been proposed .
