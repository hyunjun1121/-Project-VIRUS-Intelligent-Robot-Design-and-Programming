1-Aryl-5-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide : an effective scaffold for the design of either P21554 or CB2 receptor ligands . New 1-aryl-5-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamides were synthesized as cannabinoid ( CB ) receptor ligands . Compound 11 ( CB(1)K(i) = 2.3 nM , CB(1) SI = 163.6 ) showed CB(1) receptor affinity and selectivity superior to DB06155 and AM251 . Acute administration of 2mg/kg 11 reduced sucrose , but not regular food , intake in rats . On the other hand , compound 23 ( CB(2)K(i) = 0.51 nM , CB(2) SI = 30.0 ) showed significant affinity and selectivity for the CB(2) receptor . The results presented here show that the 1-aryl-5-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide may serve as an effective scaffold for the design of either CB(1) or CB(2) receptor ligands .
