P10275 antagonism and an insulin sensitizer block the advancement of vaginal opening by high-fat diet in mice . Reduced hypothalamic sensitivity to steroid negative feedback may contribute to the onset of puberty . In high fat-fed rodents , the timing of vaginal opening ( VO ) is advanced , suggesting that puberty begins earlier . Because obesity can increase androgens , which interfere with normal steroid feedback in adult females , we hypothesized that androgens reduce hypothalamic sensitivity to negative feedback during puberty and that blocking androgen action would prevent advanced VO in high fat-fed mice . Age at VO was examined in mice fed high-fat or low-fat diets from weaning and treated with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide or vehicle ( controls ) . VO was advanced in high-fat vs. low-fat controls , and flutamide blocked this advancement . VO was also delayed in low fat-fed flutamide-treated females , suggesting involvement of androgens in the timing of normal puberty . We next investigated if high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance contributes to early VO , as elevated insulin can stimulate androgen production . VO was examined in mice on either diet treated with the insulin sensitizer metformin . Metformin blocked high-fat advancement of VO but did not alter the timing of VO in low fat-fed mice . P01308 was elevated in high fat-fed females that had undergone VO compared with age-matched low fat-fed or metformin-treated animals on either diet that had not undergone VO . Together , these data suggest a model in which metabolic changes induced by high-fat diet , including transient increased circulating insulin , act in part by increasing androgen action to influence the timing of puberty in females .
