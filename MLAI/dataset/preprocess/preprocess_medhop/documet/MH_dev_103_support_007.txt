Clinical pharmacology of albiglutide , a P43220 agonist . DB09043 is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue composed of tandem copies of modified human glucagon-like peptide-1 ( 7-36 ) coupled to recombinant human albumin that is approved in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus . After subcutaneous administration , albiglutide is likely primarily absorbed via the lymphatic circulation , with maximum concentrations being reached in 3 to 5 days ; steady-state exposures are achieved following approximately 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration . The elimination half-life of albiglutide is approximately 5 days . Clearance of albiglutide is 67 mL/h with between-subject variability of 34.9 % ; no covariates have been identified that would require dose adjustment of albiglutide . DB09043 lowers the fasting plasma glucose and reduces postprandial glucose excursions . In addition , β-cell secretion is enhanced by albiglutide during hyperglycemia , whereas secretion is suppressed during hypoglycemia ; α-cell response to hypoglycemia is not impaired by albiglutide . DB09043 does not prolong the corrected QT interval but has a modest effect on heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Dose adjustment is not suggested in patients with renal impairment , but experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited , and it is recommended that albiglutide be used with care in such patients due to an increased frequency of diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting . No clinically relevant drug interactions have been observed in clinical trials .
