DB01017 attenuates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression correlated with modulation of p53 and AKT/ P42345 /p70S6K/ Q13541 pathway in ovarian cancer : in vitro and in vivo studies . Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -1α is the key cellular survival protein under hypoxia , and is associated with tumor progression and angiogenesis . We have recently shown the inhibitory effects of minocycline on ovarian tumor growth correlated with attenuation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and herein report a companion laboratory study to test if these effects were the result of HIF-1α inhibition . In vitro , human ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( A2780 , OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 ) were utilized to examine the effect of minocycline on Q9BYW2 and its upstream pathway components to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action of minocycline . Mice harboring OVCAR-3 xenografts were treated with minocycline to assess the in vivo efficacy of minocycline in the context of Q9BYW2 . DB01017 negatively regulated HIF-1α protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner and induced its degradation by a mechanism that is independent of prolyl-hydroxylation . The inhibition of HIF-1α was found to be associated with up-regulation of endogenous p53 , a tumor suppressor with confirmed role in HIF-1α degradation . Further studies demonstrated that the effect of minocycline was not restricted to proteasomal degradation and that it also caused down-regulation of HIF-1α translation by suppressing the AKT/ P42345 /p70S6K/ Q13541 signaling pathway . DB01017 treatment of mice bearing established ovarian tumors , led to suppression of HIF-1α accompanied by up-regulation of p53 protein levels and inactivation of AKT/ P42345 /p70S6K/ Q13541 pathway . These data reveal the therapeutic potential of minocycline in ovarian cancer as an agent that targets the pro-oncogenic factor HIF-1α through multiple mechanisms .
