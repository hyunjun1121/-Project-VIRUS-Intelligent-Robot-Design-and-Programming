Effects of subcutaneous and intravenous DB06674 on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : results of a phase 1 , randomized , open-label trial . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effects of the anti- P01375 -Î± monoclonal antibody DB06674 , administered by s.c. injection or i.v. infusion , on markers of inflammation in patients with RA . METHODS : In this phase 1 , open-label study , patients with active RA were randomized to receive s.c. DB06674 100 mg at baseline and every 4 weeks through week 20 ( n = 33 ; group 1 ) or i.v. DB06674 2 mg/kg at baseline and week 12 ( n = 16 ; group 2 ) . Serum levels of CRP , P05231 , serum amyloid A ( P0DJI8 ) , P01375 receptor II ( TNFRII ) , P08254 , hyaluronic acid , haptoglobin , ferritin and haemoglobin and serum/urine hepcidin were measured at various time points . Associations between the biomarkers were assessed with Spearman 's correlations . RESULTS : In both groups 1 and 2 , decreases in mean serum levels of CRP , P05231 , P0DJI8 , TNFRII , P08254 , haptoglobin , ferritin and hepcidin , and mean urine levels of hepcidin occurred within 1 week and were sustained through week 8 . Decreases in concentrations of serum CRP , P05231 , P0DJI8 , P08254 , hepcidin , ferritin and haptoglobin and urine hepcidin were maintained through week 24 in group 1 , but began to reverse after week 8 in group 2 . Among all patients , decreases in serum hepcidin correlated significantly with decreases in serum CRP and ferritin . CONCLUSION : Decreases in serum and urine concentrations of markers of inflammation occurred as early as 24 h after treatment with DB06674 , and most of these improvements were sustained through week 24 in group 1 .
