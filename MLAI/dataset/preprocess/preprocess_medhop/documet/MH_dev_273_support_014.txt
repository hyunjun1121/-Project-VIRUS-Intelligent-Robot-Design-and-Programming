DB01373 -calmodulin suppresses the filamentous actin-binding activity of a 135-kilodalton actin-bundling protein isolated from lily pollen tubes . We have isolated a 135-kD actin-bundling protein ( P-135- P04278 ) from lily ( Lilium longiflorum ) pollen tubes and have shown that this protein is responsible for bundling actin filaments in lily pollen tubes ( E. Yokota , K. Takahara , T. Shimmen [ 1998 ] Plant Physiol 116 : 1421-1429 ) . However , only a few thin actin-filament bundles are present in random orientation in the tip region of pollen tubes , where high concentrations of Ca(2+) have also been found . To elucidate the molecular mechanism for the temporal and spatial regulation of actin-filament organization in the tip region of pollen tubes , we explored the possible presence of factors modulating the filamentous actin ( F-actin ) -binding activity of P-135- P04278 . The F-actin-binding activity of P-135- P04278 in vitro was appreciably reduced by Ca(2+) and calmodulin ( P62158 ) , although neither Ca(2+) alone nor P62158 in the presence of low concentrations of Ca(2+) affects the activity of P-135- P04278 . A micromolar order of Ca(2+) and P62158 were needed to induce the inhibition of the binding activity of P-135- P04278 to F-actin . An antagonist for P62158 , W-7 , cancelled this inhibition . W-5 also alleviated the inhibition effect of Ca(2+)- P62158 , however , more weakly than W-7 . These results suggest the specific interaction of P-135- P04278 with Ca(2+)- P62158 . In the presence of both Ca(2+) and P62158 , P-135- P04278 organized F-actin into thin bundles , instead of the thick bundles observed in the absence of P62158 . These results suggest that the inhibition of the P-135- P04278 activity by Ca(2+)- P62158 is an important regulatory mechanism for organizing actin filaments in the tip region of lily pollen tubes .
