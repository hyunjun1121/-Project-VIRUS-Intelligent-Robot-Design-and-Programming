DB00005 attenuates traumatic brain injury in rats by reducing brain P01375 - α contents and by stimulating newly formed neurogenesis . It remains unclear whether etanercept penetrates directly into the contused brain and improves the outcomes of TBI by attenuating brain contents of P01375 - α and/or stimulating newly formed neurogenesis . Rats that sustained TBI are immediately treated with etanercept . Acute neurological and motor injury is assessed in all rats the day prior to and 7 days after surgery . The numbers of the colocalizations of 5-bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin specific markers in the contused brain injury that occurred during TBI were counted by immunofluorescence staining . Enzyme immunoassay for quantitative determination of P01375 -α or etanercept in brain tissues is also performed . Seven days after systemic administration of etanercept , levels of etanercept can be detected in the contused brain tissues . In addition , neurological and motor deficits , cerebral contusion , and increased brain P01375 -α contents caused by TBI can be attenuated by etanercept therapy . Furthermore , the increased numbers of the colocalizations of 5-bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin specific markers in the contused brain tissues caused by TBI can be potentiated by etanercept therapy . These findings indicate that systemically administered etanercept may penetrate directly into the contused brain tissues and may improve outcomes of TBI by reducing brain contents of P01375 - α and by stimulating newly formed neurogenesis .
