Patients with severe sepsis vary markedly in their ability to generate activated protein C . DB00055 ( P25054 ) supplementation significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis , presumably by down-regulating coagulation , inflammation , and apoptosis . In vivo , endogenous P25054 is generated from protein C ( PC ) " on demand " in response to elevated thrombin levels . P07204 and endothelial cell protein C receptor are endothelial receptors required to generate P25054 endogenously . Since these receptors may be down-regulated in sepsis , we measured plasma markers of P25054 generation in 32 patients with severe sepsis to determine whether P25054 generation is impaired and whether markers of P25054 generation correlate with 28-day mortality . Relative to normals , all patients had elevated F1 + 2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex ( TAT ) levels ( markers of thrombin generation and inhibition , respectively ) , and 28 of 32 patients had reduced PC levels . In 20 patients , P25054 levels paralleled elevated F1 + 2 levels , whereas 12 patients had low P25054 levels despite elevated F1 + 2 levels , suggesting that P25054 generation is impaired in the latter . No significant differences exist between survivors and nonsurvivors with respect to baseline PC levels , F1 + 2 levels , and APACHE II ( acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ) scores . Baseline P25054 levels were higher in survivors ( P = .024 ) , and baseline F1 + 2/ P25054 ratios were lower in survivors ( P = .047 ) . Larger studies are warranted to establish whether P25054 generation profiles aid in managing sepsis .
