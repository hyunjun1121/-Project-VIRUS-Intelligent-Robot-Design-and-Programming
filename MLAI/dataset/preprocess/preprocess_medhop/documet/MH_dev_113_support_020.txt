DB03843 - or adjuvant-induced peripheral inflammation increases neurokinin-1 receptor gene expression in the mouse . Substance P ( SP ) has been widely studied as a mediator of nociception . The release of SP from primary afferent neurons is increased during nociception , and SP activates neurokinin-1 ( NK-1 ) receptors in the spinal cord and periphery . Nociception-evoked alterations in P25103 gene expression have been studied in rat models of persistent pain but have not been characterized in any murine models of peripheral inflammation . This study assessed behavioral responses and P25103 mRNA gene expression in mice receiving formalin or Freund 's complete adjuvant ( O75347 ) as an inflammatory stimulus . Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured before injection of formalin or O75347 and hind paw licking/biting timed during the late-phase of the formalin response . Two and 24 hours after formalin or O75347 injection , mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured and the mice euthanized . Solution hybridization-nuclease protection assays were used to quantify P25103 mRNA levels . Results demonstrated that inflamed hind paws were edematous , and the withdrawal thresholds of the inflamed hind paws were significantly lower after formalin or O75347 injection . Neurokinin-1 receptor mRNA levels in the ipsilateral dorsal spinal cords of mice were higher at 24 h after formalin injection or 4 days after O75347 injection . These results confirm that mice are hyperalgesic at late time points after formalin or adjuvant injection when P25103 gene expression is elevated in the dorsal spinal cord . This supports the hypothesis that increased P25103 gene expression contributes to the development and maintenance of a hyperalgesic state .
