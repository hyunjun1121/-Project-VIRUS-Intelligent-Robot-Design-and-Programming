DB00107 increases invasive properties of endometrial cancer cells through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-dependent up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-1 , -2 , and P98170 . Traditionally , oxytocin ( OT ) is well known to play a crucial role in the regulation of cyclic changes in the uterus , implantation of the embryo , and parturition . Recently , an additional role for OT has been identified in several types of cancer cells in which OT acts as a growth regulator . In endometrial cancer cells , OT is known to efficiently inhibit cellular proliferation . In the present study , we show that OT increases invasiveness of human endometrial carcinoma ( O14777 ) cells , which are otherwise resistant to the growth-inhibiting effects of OT . Using pharmacological inhibitors , invasion assay , RNA interference , and immunofluorescence , we found that OT enhances the invasive properties of O14777 cells through up-regulation of P98170 ( P98170 ) , matrix-metalloproteinase 2 ( P08253 ) , and matrix-metalloproteinase 14 ( P50281 ) . In addition , we show that OT-mediated invasion is both cyclooxygenase 1 ( P23219 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) dependent via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT ( PIK3/AKT ) pathway . P35354 knockdown by shRNA resulted in P98170 down-regulation . We also show that OT receptor is overexpressed in grade I to III endometrial cancer . Taken together , our results describe for the first time a novel role for OT in endometrial cancer cell invasion .
