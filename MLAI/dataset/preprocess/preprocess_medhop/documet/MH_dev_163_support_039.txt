A set of consensus mammalian mediator subunits identified by multidimensional protein identification technology . The Mediator is a multiprotein transcriptional coactivator that is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals and is required for induction of RNA polymerase II ( pol II ) transcription by DNA binding transcription factors . In the work described here , we exploit multidimensional protein identification technology ( MudPIT ) to carry out a proteomic analysis of the subunit composition of the mammalian Mediator complex . By comparing MudPIT data sets obtained from six independent Mediator preparations immunoaffinity purified through their Nut2 ( Q9BTT4 ) , Med25 ( Q9NWA0 ) , Intersex ( Q9NX70 ) , A0JLT2 ( A0JLT2 ) , AK007855 ( Q9H204 ) , or CRSP70 ( O95402 ) subunits , we identify a set of consensus mammalian Mediator subunits . In addition , we identify as Mediator-associated proteins the P49336 -like cyclin-dependent kinase CDK11 and the Q9UHV7 -like Q71F56 protein ( Q71F56 ) , which is mutated in patients with the congenital heart defect transposition of the great arteries ( TGA ) .
