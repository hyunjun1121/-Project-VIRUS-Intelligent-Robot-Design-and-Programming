Effects of targeted deletion of cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 on immune competence and sensitivity to immune modulation by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol . The role of cannabinoid receptors , P21554 and CB2 , in immune competence and modulation by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta9-THC ) was investigated in P21554 (-/-)/CB2(-/-) mice . Immunofluorescence analysis of splenic leukocytes showed no significant differences in the percentage of T cell subsets , B cells , or macrophages between wild-type and P21554 (-/-)/CB2(-/-) mice . Lymphoproliferative control responses to PHA , phorbol ester plus ionomycin , or LPS and sensitivity to suppression by Delta9-THC showed no profound differences between the two genotypes , although some differences were observed in control baseline responses . Likewise , similar control responses and sensitivity to Delta9-THC were observed in mixed lymphocyte responses ( P08235 ) and in P60568 and P01579 production in both genotypes . Conversely , humoral immune responses showed a markedly different profile of activity . Delta9-THC suppressed the in vivo T cell-dependent , anti-sheep RBC ( anti-sRBC ) IgM antibody-forming cell ( AFC ) response in wild-type but not in P21554 (-/-)/CB2(-/-) mice , and the in vitro anti-sRBC IgM response in P21554 (-/-)/CB2(-/-) splenocytes was too low to rigorously assess P21554 /CB2 involvement in modulation by Delta9-THC . Conversely , comparable in vitro IgM AFC control responses to LPS and P29965 ( P29965 ) activation were observed in the two genotypes . Interestingly , LPS-induced IgM responses were refractory to suppression by Delta9-THC , regardless of genotype , and P29965 -induced IgM responses were only suppressed by Delta9-THC in wild-type but not in P21554 (-/-)/CB2(-/-) B cells . Collectively , we demonstrate differential involvement of P21554 and/or CB2 in immune modulation by Delta9-THC and in some control responses . Moreover , P21554 /CB2 involvement was observed in humoral responses requiring P25942 -initiated signaling for suppression by Delta9-THC .
