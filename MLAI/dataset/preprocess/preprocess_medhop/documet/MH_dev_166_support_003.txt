A Hepatocyte Growth Factor ( P14210 ) /receptor autocrine loop regulates constitutive self-renewal of human periodontal ligament cells but reduces sensitivity to exogenous P14210 . BACKGROUND : In addition to its prominent role in liver regeneration , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) is now generally thought to be produced by mesenchymal cells to promote the regeneration of epithelial tissue by a paracrine mechanism . However , it is not known how or if P14210 could be involved in the regeneration of periodontal tissues . The purpose of this study was to characterize the ability of normal human periodontal ligament ( PDL ) cells to produce or respond to P14210 . METHODS : PDL cells derived from healthy young volunteers were used from passages four through 10 . P14210 receptors were detected both by immunocytochemical staining and Western-blotting analysis . Both DNA synthesis ( by bromo-deoxyuridine [ BrdU ] -incorporation ) and secreted P14210 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphorylation was also analyzed by Western blot . RESULTS : Despite the immunocytochemical demonstration of P08581 protein in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane of PDL cells , exogenous recombinant human P14210 did not exert the mitogenic effects expected . As reported for other mesenchymal cells , PDL cells were found to secrete P14210 . Treatments with neutralizing anti- P14210 antibody significantly suppressed constitutive PDL cell proliferation and sustained the receptor protein at higher levels than in non-treated cells . Under these conditions , exogenous P14210 rapidly phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) , an action linked to the cell proliferation and downregulation of cell-surface receptors . CONCLUSIONS : Unlike other known mesenchymal or epithelial cells , these findings suggest that normal PDL cells from young donors possess a constitutive P14210 /receptor autocrine loop that normally regulates their replacement self-proliferation but reduces sensitivity to exogenously applied P14210 by acute receptor downregulation .
