P01308 -like growth factor-I as a promoting factor for cerebellar Purkinje cell development . In the mammalian CNS , the peptide hormone insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) is synthesized in a certain subset of neurons and , it has been suggested , serves as a local neurotrophic factor . A postnatal increase in the expression of P05019 and the type-1 IGF receptors ( P12314 ) in the cerebellar cortex and its related brain regions indicates that developing cerebellar Purkinje cells ( PC ) may be an important target of P05019 . However , little is known about how P05019 influences PC development . Here we addressed this question , using a reduced environment of cerebellar neuron culture derived from perinatal mice . P05019 exogenously applied at a physiological concentration ( 10 nm ) greatly promoted the dendritic growth and survival of the PCs . By contrast , P05019 only slightly promoted the somatic growth and little affected the maturation of the electrophysiological excitability of the PCs . The closely related hormone insulin had weaker promoting effects than did P05019 . P05019 appeared to at least bind to P12314 and to up-regulate the signalling pathways involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( P19957 -K ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , p38 kinase ( p38K ) , and an unknown signalling molecule(s) . These signalling pathways may be coupled to the individual aspects of PC development in different manners and this may explain the difference in effects of P05019 among these aspects . These findings suggest that P05019 serves as a promoting factor for PC development , particularly postnatal survival and dendritic growth .
