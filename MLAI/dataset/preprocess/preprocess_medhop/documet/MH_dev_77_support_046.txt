Induction of nitric oxide synthase in mouse dendritic cells by P01579 , endotoxin , and interaction with allogeneic T cells : nitric oxide production is associated with dendritic cell apoptosis . DB00435 ( NO ) is an important effector molecule that is involved in immune regulation and host defense . In this study , highly purified NLDC 145+ ( O60449 + ) MHC class II(bright) P33681 -2+ dendritic cells ( DC ) propagated from normal mouse bone marrow in response to granulocyte-macrophage P04141 + P05112 were induced to produce NO by P01579 and LPS . NO production was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine ( NMMA ) . Nitrite also accumulated in mixed leukocyte culture supernatants as the result of coculture of DC with purified naive allogeneic T cells . Furthermore , NO production was induced by P25942 ligation . Suboptimal T cell proliferation observed at high relative concentrations of DC correlated with increased NO production and was mitigated by NMMA . Induction of mRNA for an inducible NOS ( P35228 ) in DC was confirmed by Northern blotting , whereas intracellular P35228 was visualized by two-color flow cytometry and by both immunofluorescent and immunogold labeling in a subpopulation of P01579 + LPS-stimulated cells . Both endogenous NO production and exposure of unstimulated DC to the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine ( P60880 ) resulted in DC apoptosis . Thus , although DC function initially as the most potent APCs for T cell activation , DC induced to synthesize NOS by P01579 may inhibit ( allogeneic ) T cell proliferation : NO may suppress lymphocyte proliferation and also induce apoptosis of the most potent source of alloantigenic stimulation .
