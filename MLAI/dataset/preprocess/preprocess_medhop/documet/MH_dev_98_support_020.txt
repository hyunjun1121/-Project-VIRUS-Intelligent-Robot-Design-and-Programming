Growth factors temporally associate with airway responsiveness and inflammation in allergen-exposed mice . BACKGROUND : To clarify whether growth factors play critical roles in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness ( P35869 ) and airway inflammation in the early stages of asthma , the relationship between growth factors and P35869 and airway inflammation were analyzed in a mouse model of asthma . METHODS : Following ovalbumin ( OVA ) sensitization and challenge , airway function , inflammation , cytokine and growth factor levels were monitored . RESULTS : P35869 to inhaled methacholine increased at 6 h , peaked at 48 h , and remained elevated for 14 days . P05112 and P05113 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid were increased at 6 h , peaked at 24 h , but returned to baseline quickly . P35225 levels increased up to 14 days , peaking at 48 h . Increases in BAL fluid transforming growth factor-beta(1) and platelet-derived growth factor were observed at 12 h , and remained elevated at 14 days . Nerve growth factor levels were increased at 24-28 days . BAL fluid hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) was detected at 12 h , peaked at 24 h , and returned to baseline by 72 h . c- DB00134 / P08581 was detected in the airways at 6 h , before P14210 in the BAL , and continued to be observed 96 h after the last OVA challenge . CONCLUSIONS : These data identify a temporal association between growth factor production and Th2 cytokine production and the kinetics of P35869 . Growth factors may play important roles in the development of allergic airway inflammation and P35869 even in the early stages of asthma , before remodeling is initiated .
