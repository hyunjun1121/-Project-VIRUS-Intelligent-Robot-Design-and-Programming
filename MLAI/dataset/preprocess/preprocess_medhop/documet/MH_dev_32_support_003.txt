Natriuretic peptide receptor A signaling regulates stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis : a model to study linkage between inflammation and tumorigenesis . Natriuretic peptide receptor A ( NPRA ) , the signaling receptor for the cardiac hormone , atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , is expressed abundantly in inflamed/injured tissues and tumors . NPRA deficiency substantially decreases tissue inflammation and inhibits tumor growth . However , the precise mechanism of NPRA function and whether it links inflammation and tumorigenesis remains unknown . Since both injury repair and tumor growth require stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis , we examined the role of NPRA signaling in tumor angiogenesis as a model of tissue injury repair in this study . In in vitro cultures , aortas from NPRA-KO mice show significantly lower angiogenic response compared to wild-type counterparts . The NPRA antagonist that decreases NPRA expression , inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced angiogenesis . The reduction in angiogenesis correlates with decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( P61073 ) implicating a cell recruitment defect . To test whether NPRA regulates migration of cells to tumors , DB05914 ( MSCs ) were administered i.v. , and the results showed that MSCs fail to migrate to the tumor microenvironment in NPRA-KO mice . However , coimplanting tumor cells with MSCs increases angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in NPRA-KO mice , in part by promoting expression of P61073 and its ligand , stromal cell-derived factor 1Î± . Taken together , these results demonstrate that NPRA signaling regulates stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis leading to tumor growth . Thus , NPRA signaling provides a key linkage between inflammation and tumorigenesis , and NPRA may be a target for drug development against cancers and tissue injury repair .
