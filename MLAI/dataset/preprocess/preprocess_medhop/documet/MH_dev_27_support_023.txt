Histone deacetylase inhibitors increase microRNA-146a expression and enhance negative regulation of interleukin-1β signaling in osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes . OBJECTIVE : MiR-146a exerts negative control on inflammatory responses by suppressing cytokine-induced expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 ( P51617 ) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( Q9Y4K3 ) by impairing NF-κB activity and inhibiting the expression of target genes . Recent study suggests that histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are involved in the regulation of microRNA ( miRNA ) expression . Therefore , we determined whether HDAC inhibitors can increase miR-146a expression , thereby inhibiting interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) -induced signaling in osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( OA-FLS ) . METHOD : MiRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR . IL-1β-induced downstream signals and cytokine expression were evaluated using Western blotting and ELISA . Transcription factors regulating promoter activation were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS : IL-1β treatment of OA-FLS induced a mild ( 1.7-fold ) increase in miR-146a expression that was unable to appropriately downregulate P51617 and Q9Y4K3 expression . HDAC inhibitors , DB02546 ( vorinostat ) , and LBH589 ( DB06603 ) significantly ( 6.1- and 5.4-fold ) elevated miR-146a expression by increasing the binding of the transcription factor NF-κB to the miR-146a promoter , and negatively regulated IL-1β-induced IKK/IκB/p65 phosphorylation signaling and P05231 secretion . The increase in miR-146a expression induced by the HDAC inhibitors was prevented by transfection of miR-146a inhibitor or Q13547 ( class I HDAC ) , P56524 ( class IIa HDAC ) , and Q9UBN7 ( class IIb HDAC ) overexpression , suggesting that they were due to inhibition of HDAC activity . CONCLUSIONS : Our study demonstrated that HDAC inhibitor treatment in OA-FLS significantly increased miR-146a expression and mediated markedly negative regulation to inhibit IL-1β-induced signaling and cytokine secretion . Our results indicate the potential rationale of anti-inflammatory effects for HDAC inhibitors .
