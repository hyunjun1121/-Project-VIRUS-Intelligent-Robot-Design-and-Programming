DB00067 receptor expression and mutation analysis in corticotropin-secreting tumors . DB00067 is an important regulator of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activation , primarily acting through the V3 receptor ( V3R ) . Many patients with DB01285 -secreting pituitary adenomas , but not normal individuals , respond to desmopressin , a relatively V2-specific vasopressin agonist , with increased DB01285 and cortisol levels . We have searched for mutations of the V3R gene in DB01285 -secreting pituitary adenomas and one ectopic DB01285 -secreting tumor . No abnormalities were found in 12 tumors studied by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis . We then verified by RT-PCR whether the response to desmopressin was due to overexpression of the V3R or abnormal expression of the P30518 in the pituitary tumor . We found that the P30518 gene was expressed in a number of corticotroph tumors and in the DB01285 -secreting ectopic tumor , and that the V3R gene appears to be overexpressed in these tumors . We conclude that V3R mutations are unlikely to be present in the DB01285 -secreting tumors we examined , but that the P30518 gene is expressed in the majority of the samples tested , and the V3R is expressed in all of these tumors . We speculate that the response to the desmopressin test observed in patients with Cushing 's disease may be due to abnormal expression of V3R or P30518 in DB01285 -secreting tumors .
