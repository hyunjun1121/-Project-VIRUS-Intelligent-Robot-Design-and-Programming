P23560 activation of P62158 -kinase kinase via transient receptor potential canonical channels induces the translation and synaptic incorporation of P42261 -containing calcium-permeable AMPA receptors . Glutamatergic synapses in early postnatal development transiently express calcium-permeable AMPA receptors ( CP-AMPARs ) . Although these P42262 -lacking receptors are essential and are elevated in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) , little is known regarding molecular mechanisms that govern their expression and synaptic insertion . Here we show that P23560 -induced P42261 translation in rat primary hippocampal neurons requires the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) via calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase ( CaMKK ) . Specifically , P23560 -mediated phosphorylation of threonine 308 ( T308 ) in AKT , a known substrate of CaMKK and an upstream activator of P42345 -dependent translation , was prevented by ( 1 ) pharmacological inhibition of CaMKK with STO-609 , ( 2 ) overexpression of a dominant-negative CaMKK , or ( 3 ) short hairpin-mediated knockdown of CaMKK . P42261 surface expression induced by P23560 , as assessed by immunocytochemistry using an extracellular N-terminal P42261 antibody or by surface biotinylation , was impaired following knockdown of CaMKK or treatment with STO-609 . Activation of CaMKK by P23560 requires transient receptor potential canonical ( TRPC ) channels as SKF-96365 , but not the DB01221 receptor antagonist d-APV , prevented P23560 -induced P42261 surface expression as well as phosphorylation of CaMKI , AKT(T308) , and P42345 . Using siRNA we confirmed the involvement of Q9UL62 and Q9Y210 subunits in P23560 -induced AKT(T308) phosphorylation . The P23560 -induced increase in mEPSC was blocked by IEM-1460 , a selected antagonist of CP-AMPARs , as well as by the specific repression of acute P42261 translation via siRNA to P42261 but not P42262 . Together these data support the conclusion that newly synthesized P42261 subunits , induced by P23560 , are readily incorporated into synapses where they enhance the expression of CP-AMPARs and synaptic strength .
