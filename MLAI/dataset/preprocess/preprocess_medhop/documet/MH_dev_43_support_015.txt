c-Fes tyrosine kinase binds to and activates P40763 after granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulation . Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) induces proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells and also activates neutrophils . In order to investigate the pleiotropic effects of GM- P04141 stimulation , we examined the signaling pathways of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) in GM- P04141 -dependent proliferation of leukemia cells . Using TF-1 , a GM- P04141 -dependent human erythroleukemia cell line , we found that GM- P04141 enhanced DNA-binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of P40763 . GM- P04141 receptor ( GM-CSFR ) and c-Fes tyrosine kinase were also activated upon GM- P04141 stimulation . Furthermore , c-Fes formed a complex with P40763 . Experiments using a c-Fes mutant that lacked tyrosine kinase activity revealed that the activation of P40763 is kinase-dependent , but that the c-Fes- P40763 interaction is not affected by c-Fes tyrosine kinase activity . The results suggest that P40763 is activated by c-Fes tyrosine kinase through direct interaction during hematopoietic cell proliferation induced by GM- P04141 .
