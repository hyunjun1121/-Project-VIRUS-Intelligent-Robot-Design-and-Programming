Paraplegic mice are leading to new advances in spinal cord injury research . STUDY DESIGN : Experimental laboratory investigations with paraplegic mouse models . OBJECTIVES : To review the most recent advances in the field of spinal cord injury research ; immune system response , regeneration , and functional recovery . SETTINGS : Laval University and Laval University Medical Center , Quebec , Canada . METHODS : Assessment of regenerative processes and locomotor function recovery induced by a variety of treatments and approaches in wild-type and genetically engineered mice with complete or incomplete lesions of the spinal cord . RESULTS : Recent studies have reported a number of significant observations providing additional insight into the role and mechanism of regeneration , immune system response , and functional recovery after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) using incomplete paraplegic mice with Nogo-A , Q9BZR6 , EphA4 , P14136 /vimentime , P15018 , or Fas gene knock-out . A novel antibody called P02778 was also recently found to increase tissue sparing and angiogenesis after SCI . In an attempt to explore the possibilities of reactivating spared neurons below the injury level , researchers have found that pharmacological activation of specific subtypes of serotonin receptors ( eg , P08908 /2A/7 ) can sustain the production of basic locomotor-like movements in complete paraplegic mice . CONCLUSION : The growing availability of genetically engineered and mutant mouse strains along with molecular biology tools has led scientists to increasingly use murine models in SCI research . These new tools and models may assist scientists in understanding further the complex pathological consequences of SCI .
