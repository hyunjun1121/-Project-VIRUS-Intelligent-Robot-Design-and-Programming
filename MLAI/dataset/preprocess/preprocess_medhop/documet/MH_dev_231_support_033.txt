Chewing rescues stress-suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation via activation of histamine H1 receptor . We have previously found in rats that chewing , an active behavioral strategy to cope with a stressful situation , rescues long-term potentiation ( LTP ) in the hippocampus through activating stress-suppressed N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor function . To further examine the mechanisms underlying this ameliorative effect of chewing , we studied the involvement of the histaminergic system , which has been shown to be activated by mastication , in the LTP of hippocampal slices of rats that were allowed to chew a wooden stick during exposure to immobilization stress . Chewing failed to rescue stress-suppressed LTP in the rats treated with histamine H1 receptor ( P35367 ) antagonist DB06691 ( 5 mg/kg , i.p. ) before exposure to stress , although administration of DB06691 did not affect LTP in naive rats and in stressed rats that did not chew . However , when DB06691 was administrated immediately after exposure to stress , chewing rescued LTP whose magnitude was statistically comparable to that in the rats that chewed without drug treatment . These results suggest that chewing-induced histamine release in the hippocampus and the subsequent H1 receptor activation may be essential to rescue stress-suppressed synaptic plasticity .
