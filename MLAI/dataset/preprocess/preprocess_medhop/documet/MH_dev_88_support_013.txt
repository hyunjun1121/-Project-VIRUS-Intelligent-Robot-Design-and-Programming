An unusual somatotropin and thyreotropin secreting pituitary adenoma efficiently controlled by DB00104 and DB00082 . We describe the first case of a 36 year-old male patient with a somatotropin and thyreotropin secreting pituitary adenoma , co-treated by a long-acting releasing somatostatin analog ( DB00104 ) and a P10912 antagonist ( DB00082 ) . The patient normalized his biological disease activity reflected by hormone levels but his tumor size remained unchanged as measured by Q9BWK5 . The co-treatment was well tolerated and induced a synergic effect on IGF1 levels that allowed us to use low doses of both therapies .
