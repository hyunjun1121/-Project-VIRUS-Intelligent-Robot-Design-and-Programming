Ex vivo binding of flibanserin to serotonin P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptors . DB04908 has been reported to be an agonist at P08908 -receptors and an antagonist at 5- Q13049 receptors , with higher affinity for P08908 receptors . Despite the fact that less receptor occupation is required by full agonists than by antagonists to exert their effects , flibanserin was shown to exert 5- Q13049 antagonism at doses ( 4-5 mg kg-1 ) that are lower or equal to those required to stimulate P08908 receptors . In order to understand this phenomenon , the interaction of flibanserin with P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptors was evaluated in ex vivo binding studies . This interaction was evaluated in the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and midbrain by using [3H]8-OH-DPAT and [3H]ketanserin to label P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptors , respectively . DB04908 was given at 1 , 10 and 30 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally . The dose of 1 mg kg-1 displaced both radioligands preferentially in the frontal cortex . The doses of 10 and 30 mg kg-1 reduced the binding of both radioligands in all the three brain regions non-selectively by about 50 % and 70 % , respectively . The displacement was maximal after 0.5 h and was reduced or not evident after 3 h . We conclude that 5-HT2 antagonism brought about by low doses of flibanserin may reflect functional mechanisms more than receptor-mediated effects .
