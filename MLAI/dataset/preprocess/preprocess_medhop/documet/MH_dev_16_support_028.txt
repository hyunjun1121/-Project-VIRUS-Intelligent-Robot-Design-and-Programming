Genome-wide association studies identify P30532 /3 and Q13639 in the development of airflow obstruction . RATIONALE : Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified loci influencing lung function , but fewer genes influencing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) are known . OBJECTIVES : Perform meta-analyses of GWAS for airflow obstruction , a key pathophysiologic characteristic of P48444 assessed by spirometry , in population-based cohorts examining all participants , ever smokers , never smokers , asthma-free participants , and more severe cases . METHODS : Fifteen cohorts were studied for discovery ( 3,368 affected ; 29,507 unaffected ) , and a population-based family study and a meta-analysis of case-control studies were used for replication and regional follow-up ( 3,837 cases ; 4,479 control subjects ) . Airflow obstruction was defined as Q99581 (1) and its ratio to FVC ( Q99581 (1)/FVC ) both less than their respective lower limits of normal as determined by published reference equations . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The discovery meta-analyses identified one region on chromosome 15q25.1 meeting genome-wide significance in ever smokers that includes A2RU49 , P48200 , and P30532 / P32297 genes . The region was also modestly associated among never smokers . Gene expression studies confirmed the presence of P30532 /3 in lung , airway smooth muscle , and bronchial epithelial cells . A single-nucleotide polymorphism in Q13639 , a gene previously related to Q99581 (1)/FVC , achieved genome-wide statistical significance in combined meta-analysis . Top single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Q9H013 , P10826 , O14495 , and Q8TE59 were nominally replicated in the P48444 meta-analysis . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for the P30532 /3 region as a genetic risk factor for airflow obstruction that may be independent of smoking and implicate the Q13639 gene in the etiology of airflow obstruction .
