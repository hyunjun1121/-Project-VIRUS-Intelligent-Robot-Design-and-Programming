Pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetic drugs . Oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) are used for more than a half-century in the treatment of type 2 diabetes . Only in the last five years , intensive research has been conducted in the pharmacogenetics of these drugs based mainly on the retrospective register studies , but only a handful of associations detected in these studies were replicated . The gene variants in P11712 , Q09428 / Q14654 , and Q9NQB0 were associated with the effect of sulfonylureas . P11712 encodes sulfonylurea metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 , Q09428 and Q14654 genes encode proteins constituting DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channel which is a therapeutic target for sulfonylureas , and Q9NQB0 is a gene with the strongest association with type 2 diabetes . O15245 , Q96FL8 , and Q13315 gene variants were repeatedly associated with the response to metformin . O15245 and Q96FL8 encode metformin transporters OCT1 and Q96FL8 , respectively . The function of a gene variant near Q13315 gene identified by a genome-wide association study is not elucidated so far . The first variant associated with the response to gliptins is a polymorphism in the proximity of P17538 /2 gene which encodes chymotrypsinogen . Establishment of diabetes pharmacogenetics consortia and reduction in costs of genomics might lead to some significant clinical breakthroughs in this field in a near future .
