DB00163 80th anniversary : a double life , not only fighting radicals . Recent research on DB00163 has revealed specific cellular functions of this compound belonging to the vitamin E family . Alpha-tocopherol can act as a radical scavenger , as a pro-oxidant , as an anti-alkylation agent and , most important , by mechanisms that are independent of the above properties . To the last group belong protein kinase C and P09917 inhibition at post-translational level , as well as DB00163 activation of protein phosphatase 2A and diacylglycerol kinase . Furthermore , at transcriptional level , several genes ( P16671 , alpha-TTP , alpha-tropomyosin , and collagenase ) are modulated by DB00163 . These effects result in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation , platelet aggregation , and monocyte adhesion and may be related to the alleged protection of atherosclerosis by vitamin E. On the other side , epidemiological and intervention studies have shown some inconsistent results . Rather than disregarding vitamin E as a means to protect against atherosclerosis progression , it would be wiser to better design clinical trials based on current knowledge of the biological properties of the molecule .
