P12004 -Dependent Kinase 5/p35/p39 : A Novel and Imminent Therapeutic Target for Diabetes Mellitus . Present therapies to minify hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance mainly target DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channels ( K( DB00171 ) ) of pancreatic cells and Q07869 -γ to enhance the insulin secretion and potential for GLUT expression , respectively . These current approaches are frequently associated with the various side effects such as hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular adverse events . Q00535 is a serine/threonine protein kinase , which forms active complexes with p35 or p39 found principally in neurons and in pancreatic β cells . Pieces of evidence from recent studies recommend the vital role of Q00535 in physiological functions in nonneuronal cells such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic cells . Inhibition of Q00535 averts the decrease of insulin gene expression through the inhibition of nuclear translocation of P52945 which is a transcription factor for the insulin gene . The present pieces of evidence designate that Q00535 might be a potential drug target for the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the treatment of diabetes mellitus .
