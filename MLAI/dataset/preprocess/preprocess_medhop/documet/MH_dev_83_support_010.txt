Combined preoperative use of celecoxib and gabapentin in the management of postoperative pain . BACKGROUND : In 2005 we reported a study on the efficacy of the preoperative use of the selective P35354 inhibitor celecoxib ( DB00482 ) for reducing both postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients undergoing bilateral subpectoral breast augmentation . Our findings showed that patients who received 400 mg of celecoxib 30 min before surgery required significantly less postoperative opioid analgesics compared with those given a placebo . DB00996 ( DB00996 ) is an agent commonly used to control neuropathic pain . Here we describe a prospective study assessing the efficacy of preoperative gabapentin in combination with celecoxib for reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirements in elective subpectoral breast augmentation . METHODS : One hundred eighteen patients were given 1200 mg of gabapentin and 400 mg of celecoxib 30-60 min before surgery . From the day of surgery until postoperative day 5 , patients documented any use of analgesics and recorded their degree of pain . Results were then compared with those of our previous study in which only celecoxib was used . RESULTS : The combination of gabapentin and celecoxib was found to be significantly superior ( p < 0.001 ) in reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirements than celecoxib alone in the management of postoperative pain and opioid requirements . CONCLUSION : To decrease postoperative opioid requirements , we recommend 400 mg of celecoxib and 1200 mg of gabapentin taken 30-60 min before surgery by patients undergoing subpectoral breast augmentation or a comparable plastic surgery procedure .
