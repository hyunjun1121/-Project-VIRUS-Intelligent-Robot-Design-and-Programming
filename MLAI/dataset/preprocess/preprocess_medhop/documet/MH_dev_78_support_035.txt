Update on aspirin desensitization for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease ( AERD ) . DB00945 -exacerbated respiratory disease ( AERD ) is a clinical condition which results in adverse upper and lower respiratory symptoms , particularly rhinitis , conjunctivitis , bronchospasm , and/or laryngospasm , following exposure to cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) inhibiting drugs , namely aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) . A provocative aspirin challenge is the gold standard for diagnosis of AERD . DB00945 desensitization and continuous aspirin therapy has been highly efficacious in those patients with suboptimal control of their disease on current available pharmacotherapy or those with other underlying conditions ( i.e. , cardiovascular disease ) who may require frequent treatment with aspirin or NSAIDs . This review article focuses on aspirin desensitization and the management of patients with AERD with a particular emphasis on outcomes in those patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis .
