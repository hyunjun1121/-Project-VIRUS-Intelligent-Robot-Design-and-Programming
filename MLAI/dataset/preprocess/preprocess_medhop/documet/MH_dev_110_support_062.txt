Association study of a cannabinoid receptor gene ( P21554 ) polymorphism and schizophrenia . Cannabis can induce schizophrenic-like symptoms in healthy individuals . A principal active ingredient of cannabis , DB00470 , acts in the brain on a specific receptor , termed the cannabinoid receptor 1 ( P21554 ) . The human gene for P21554 is mapped to chromosome 6q14-15 , and linkage studies have produced evidence for a schizophrenia-susceptibility locus in this region . To explore a possible role for P21554 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders , we used an association study to genotype the P21554 polymorphism for 127 schizophrenic patients and 146 control subjects . The results demonstrate no association between P21554 genotypes and schizophrenic disorders ( P = 0.409 ) , with these negative findings suggesting that , for Chinese populations , the ( P01009 )n triplet repeat in the promoter region of the P21554 gene is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders .
