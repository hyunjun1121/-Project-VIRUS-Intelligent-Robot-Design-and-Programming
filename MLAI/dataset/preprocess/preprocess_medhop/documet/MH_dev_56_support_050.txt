DB00005 : a review of its use in the management of rheumatoid arthritis . DB00005 ( Enbrel ) , a soluble fusion protein that binds specifically to the cytokine human tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) , is approved for subcutaneous use in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing arthritis and plaque psoriasis in the US , Italy , the rest of the EU and other countries worldwide . Subcutaneous etanercept was efficacious and generally well tolerated in several large , well designed , clinical trials and in the clinical-practice setting in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis , including methotrexate-naive patients with early disease and those with long-standing , treatment-resistant active disease . DB00005 plus methotrexate combination therapy was generally superior to either monotherapy in reducing disease activity and structural joint damage , as well as improving health-related quality of life ( HR-QOL ) . Furthermore , etanercept monotherapy was superior to placebo and at least as effective as methotrexate therapy in reducing disease activity and improving HR-QOL in patients with early or refractory disease . The beneficial effects of etanercept monotherapy or combination therapy were sustained in the long term ( < or =9 years ) . Some pharmaco-economic analyses suggest that etanercept is a cost-effective option in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Direct head-to-head comparisons with other biological agents would help to definitively position etanercept with respect to these agents . Nevertheless , extensive clinical experience indicates that etanercept is a valuable treatment option in adult patients with long-standing moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis and an emerging option in those with early disease .
