One target , different effects : a comparison of distinct therapeutic antibodies against the same targets . To date , more than 30 antibodies have been approved worldwide for therapeutic use . While the monoclonal antibody market is rapidly growing , the clinical use of therapeutic antibodies is mostly limited to treatment of cancers and immunological disorders . Moreover , antibodies against only five targets ( P01375 -α , P04626 , P11836 , P00533 , and P15692 ) account for more than 80 percent of the worldwide market of therapeutic antibodies . The shortage of novel , clinically proven targets has resulted in the development of many distinct therapeutic antibodies against a small number of proven targets , based on the premise that different antibody molecules against the same target antigen have distinct biological and clinical effects from one another . For example , four antibodies against P01375 -α have been approved by the FDA -- infliximab , adalimumab , DB06674 , and certolizumab pegol -- with many more in clinical and preclinical development . The situation is similar for P04626 , P11836 , P00533 , and P15692 , each having one or more approved antibodies and many more under development . This review discusses the different binding characteristics , mechanisms of action , and biological and clinical activities of multiple monoclonal antibodies against P01375 -α , HER-2 , P11836 , and P00533 and provides insights into the development of therapeutic antibodies .
