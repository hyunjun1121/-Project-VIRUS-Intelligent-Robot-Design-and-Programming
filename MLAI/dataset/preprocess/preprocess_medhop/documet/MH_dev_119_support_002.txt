Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory processes : nutrition or pharmacology ? DB00159 ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) are n-3 fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements . These fatty acids are able to inhibit partly a number of aspects of inflammation including leucocyte chemotaxis , adhesion molecule expression and leucocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions , production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid , production of inflammatory cytokines and T cell reactivity . In parallel , EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from arachidonioc acid and EPA and DB01708 give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving resolvins and protectins . Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition , disruption of lipid rafts , inhibition of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of inflammatory genes , activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor P37231 ( i.e. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ ) and binding to the G protein coupled receptor Q5NUL3 . These mechanisms are interlinked . In adult humans , an EPA plus DB01708 intake greater than 2 g day⁻¹ seems to be required to elicit anti-inflammatory actions , but few dose finding studies have been performed . Animal models demonstrate benefit from n-3 fatty acids in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) and asthma . Clinical trials of fish oil in patients with RA demonstrate benefit supported by meta-analyses of the data . Clinical trails of fish oil in patients with Q9UKU7 and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy .
