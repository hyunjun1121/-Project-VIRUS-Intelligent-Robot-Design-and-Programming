Farnesoid X receptor activation by chenodeoxycholic acid induces detoxifying enzymes through AMP-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β . Farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) regulates redox homeostasis and elicits a cytoprotective effect . CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β ( C/EBPβ ) plays a role in regulating the expression of hepatocyte-specific genes and contributes to hepatocyte protection and liver regeneration . In view of the role of Q96RI1 in xenobiotic metabolism and hepatocyte survival , this study investigated the potential of Q96RI1 to activate C/EBPβ for the induction of detoxifying enzymes and the responsible regulatory pathway . Chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , a major component in bile acids , activates Q96RI1 . In HepG2 cells , DB06777 treatment activated C/EBPβ , as shown by increases in its phosphorylation , nuclear accumulation , and expression . 3-(2,6-Dichlorophenyl)-4-(3'-carboxy-2-chlorostilben-4-yl-)oxymethyl-5-isopropyl-isoxazole ( GW4064 ) , a synthetic Q96RI1 ligand , had similar effects . In addition , DB06777 enhanced luciferase gene transcription from the construct containing -1.65-kb P09210 promoter , which contained C/EBP response element ( pGL-1651 ) . Moreover , DB06777 treatment activated AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , which led to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) activation , as evidenced by the results of experiments using a dominant-negative mutant of AMPKα and chemical inhibitor . The activation of P27361 /2 was responsible for the activating phosphorylation of C/EBPβ . Q96RI1 knockdown attenuated the ability of DB06777 to activate AMPK and P27361 /2 and phosphorylate C/EBPβ . Consistently , enforced expression of Q96RI1 promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα , P27361 /2 , and C/EBPβ , verifying that C/EBPβ phosphorylation elicited by DB06777 results from the activation of AMPK and P27361 /2 by Q96RI1 . In mice , DB06777 treatment activated C/EBPβ with the induction of detoxifying enzymes in the liver . Our results demonstrate that DB06777 induces antioxidant and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes by activating C/EBPβ through AMPK-dependent P27361 /2 pathway downstream of Q96RI1 .
