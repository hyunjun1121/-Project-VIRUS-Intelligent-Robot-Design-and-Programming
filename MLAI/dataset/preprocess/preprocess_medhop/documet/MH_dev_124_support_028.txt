DB00136 induces nitric oxide production in cultured endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : Recently , DB00136 ( vitD ) has received increasing interest for its effects on many tissues and organs other than bone . A number of experimental studies have shown that vitD may have an important role in modifying risk for cardiovascular disease . AIMS : This study was planned to test the effects of vitD on endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) production and to study the intracellular pathways leading to NO release . METHODS : In human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) cultures the effects of vitD on NO production and p38 , Akt , P29323 and P29474 phosphorylations were examined in absence or in presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME and protein kinases specific inhibitors SB203580 , wortmannin and UO126 . RESULTS : VitD caused a concentration-dependent increase in NO production . The maximum effect was observed at a concentration of 1 nM and the optimal time of stimulation was 1 min . Effects induced by vitD were abolished by L-NAME and by pre-treatment with protein kinases inhibitors . To verify the effective involvement of vitD receptor ( P11473 ) in the action mechanism of vitD , experiments were repeated in presence of the specific P11473 ligands ZK159222 and ZK191784 . CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study demonstrate that vitD can induce a significant increase in endothelial NO production . VitD interaction with P11473 caused the phosphorylation of p38 , AKT and P29323 leading to P29474 activation .
