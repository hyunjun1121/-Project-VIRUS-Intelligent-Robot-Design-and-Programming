DB01079 treatment for IBS : a model of indirect costs . Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) has been associated with substantial time lost from work ( absenteeism ) and reduced productivity at work ( presenteeism ) , which are the indirect costs of illness . This article presents a productivity model demonstrating the indirect costs associated with IBS and the reduction in those costs for a cohort of female employees hypothetically treated with tegaserod , a new selective serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine [ 5-HT ] ) type 4 ( Q13639 ) receptor agonist , which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating women with IBS-C . The model is based on economic and epidemiologic published literature and clinical trial results . In this model , tegaserod treatment resulted in 1882 dollars in avoided lost productivity per treated female employee . Considering only the benefits of decreased work loss and the costs of medical therapy , the model predicts a benefit/cost ratio of 3.75 in the base case . From an employer 's perspective , medical therapy for IBS with tegaserod is cost-effective under a series of assumptions for the treatment of women with IBS with constipation .
