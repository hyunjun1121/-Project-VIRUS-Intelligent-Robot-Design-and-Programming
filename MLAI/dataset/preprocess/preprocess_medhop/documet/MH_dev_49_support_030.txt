Reactive oxygen species , DNA damage , and error-prone repair : a model for genomic instability with progression in myeloid leukemia ? Myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis , with an increased propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . The molecular basis for P43034 progression is unknown , but a key element in P43034 disease progression is loss of chromosomal material ( genomic instability ) . Using our two-step mouse model for myeloid leukemic disease progression involving overexpression of human mutant P01111 and P10415 genes , we show that there is a stepwise increase in the frequency of DNA damage leading to an increased frequency of error-prone repair of double-strand breaks ( DSB ) by nonhomologous end-joining . There is a concomitant increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these transgenic mice with disease progression . Importantly , P63000 , an essential component of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase , is downstream of DB01367 , and we show that ROS production in P01111 / P10415 mice is in part dependent on P63000 activity . DNA damage and error-prone repair can be decreased or reversed in vivo by N-acetyl cysteine antioxidant treatment . Our data link gene abnormalities to constitutive DNA damage and increased DSB repair errors in vivo and provide a mechanism for an increase in the error rate of DNA repair with P43034 disease progression . These data suggest treatment strategies that target DB01367 / P31749 pathways and ROS production in human P43034 /AML .
