DB00133 palmitoyltransferase , a key enzyme for de novo synthesis of sphingolipids , is essential for male gametophyte development in Arabidopsis . Sphingolipids are important signaling molecules involved in various cellular activities . De novo sphingolipid synthesis is initiated by a rate-limiting enzyme , serine palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) , a heterodimer consisting of LONG-CHAIN BASE1 ( O15269 ) and O15270 subunits . A mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana O15269 gene , lcb1-1 , was found to cause embryo lethality . However , the underpinning molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unclear . Here , we report the identification of the fumonisin B(1) resistant11-2 ( fbr11-2 ) mutant , an allele of lcb1-1 . The fbr11-2 mutation , most likely an allele stronger than lcb1-1 , was transmitted only through female gametophytes and caused the formation of abortive microspores . During the second pollen mitosis , fbr11-2 initiated apoptotic cell death in binucleated microspores characteristic of nuclear DNA fragmentation , followed by cytoplasm shrinkage and organelle degeneration at the trinucleated stage . In addition , a double mutant with T-DNA insertions in two homologous O15270 genes showed a phenotype similar to fbr11-2 . Consistent with these observations , the FBR11/ O15269 expression was confined in microspores during microgametogenesis . These results suggest that P21549 -modulated programmed cell death plays an important role in the regulation of male gametophyte development .
