Mucin variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms and severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease : significant association with P98088 . Variability in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease is partially due to non- P13569 genetic modifiers . Mucin genes are very polymorphic , and mucins play a key role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease ; therefore , mucin genes are strong candidates as genetic modifiers . DNA from CF patients recruited for extremes of lung phenotype was analyzed by Southern blot or PCR to define variable number tandem repeat ( VNTR ) length polymorphisms for P15941 , Q02817 , P98088 , and Q8TAX7 . VNTR length polymorphisms were tested for association with lung disease severity and for linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . No strong associations were found for P15941 , Q02817 , or Q8TAX7 . A significant association was found between the overall distribution of P98088 VNTR length and CF lung disease severity ( p = 0.025 ; n = 468 patients ) ; plus , there was robust association of the specific 6.4 kb HinfI VNTR fragment with severity of lung disease ( p = 6.2Ã—10(-4) after Bonferroni correction ) . There was strong LD between P98088 VNTR length modes and flanking SNPs . The severity-associated 6.4 kb VNTR allele of P98088 was confirmed to be genetically distinct from the 6.3 kb allele , as it showed significantly stronger association with nearby SNPs . These data provide detailed respiratory mucin gene VNTR allele distributions in CF patients . Our data also show a novel link between the P98088 6.4 kb VNTR allele and severity of CF lung disease . The LD pattern with surrounding SNPs suggests that the 6.4 kb allele contains , or is linked to , important functional genetic variation .
