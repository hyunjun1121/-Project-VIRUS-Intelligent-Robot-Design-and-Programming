P06850 and acute stress prolongs serotonergic regulation of GABA transmission in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons . The stress-related neuropeptide DB05394 ( CRF ) and the serotonin system are both critically involved in the pathophysiology of mental disorders , including anxiety and depression . To understand the potential link between them , we investigated the impact of CRF on 5-HT functions in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) , a brain region that is crucial for the control of emotion and cognition . One prominent function of serotonin in P27918 is to regulate GABAergic inhibitory transmission , as indicated by a 5-HT-induced large , desensitizing ( approximately 4 min ) enhancement of the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSCs ( sIPSCs ) . In P27918 slices exposed to CRF treatment , the regulation of sIPSCs by 5-HT was significantly prolonged ( 8-10 min ) , and this effect of CRF was blocked by treatment with the competitive CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 and with the P34998 -specific antagonist astressin . Inhibiting phospholipase C or protein kinase C ( PKC ) abolished the prolongation by CRF of the effects of 5-HT on sIPSCs . In P27918 slices prepared from animals previously exposed to acute stress ( forced swim or elevated platform ) , the regulation of sIPSCs by 5-HT was significantly prolonged , mimicking the effect of CRF treatment . The stress-induced prolongation of the effects of 5-HT on sIPSCs was diminished by alpha-helical CRF9-41 treatment , mimicked by direct activation of PKC , and reversed by short-term treatment with drugs that have anxiolytic efficacy . These results show that in response to stressful stimuli , CRF alters the serotonergic regulation of GABA transmission through a mechanism that is dependent on PKC . The interaction between CRF and 5-HT may play an important role in psychiatric disorders , in which both are highly implicated .
