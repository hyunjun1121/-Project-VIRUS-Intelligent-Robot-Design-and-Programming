Transforming growth factor alpha-induced expression of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor in astrocytes rescues neurons from excitotoxicity . Although transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha , a member of the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family , has been shown to protect neurons against excitotoxic and ischemic brain injuries , its mechanism of action remains unknown . In the present study , we used in vitro models of apoptotic or necrotic paradigms demonstrating that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) -induced excitotoxic death , with the obligatory presence of astrocytes . Because neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) release was shown to potentiate DB01221 -induced excitotoxicity , we observed that TGF-alpha treatment reduced DB01221 -induced increase of t-PA activity in mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes . In addition , we showed that although TGF-alpha induces activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) in astrocytes , it failed to activate Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 in neurons . Finally , we showed that TGF-alpha , by an P29323 -dependent mechanism , stimulates the astrocytic expression of P05121 , a t-PA inhibitor , which mediates the neuroprotective activity of TGF-alpha against DB01221 -mediated excitotoxic neuronal death . Taken together , we indicate that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from DB01221 -induced excitotoxicity in mixed cultures through inhibition of t-PA activity , involving P05121 overexpression by an P29323 -dependent pathway in astrocytes .
