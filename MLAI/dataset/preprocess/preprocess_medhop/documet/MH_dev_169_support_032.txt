DB00054 : cost-effective survival advantage in clinical trials and clinical practice . Adjunctive blockade of the platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor during either percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) or for patients who present with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes has demonstrated efficacy in reducing platelet-mediated adverse cardiovascular ischemic events . The three currently available agents ( abciximab , eptifibatide , tirofiban ) differ markedly in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles , receptor affinity , and cost . Although pharmacoeconomic substudies are available from placebo-controlled randomized trials of platelet P08514 /IIIa blockade during P05154 , " real-world " cost-effectiveness data from high-volume practice are lacking . Therefore , in-hospital and late ( 6-month ) clinical outcomes and cumulative cost/charge data were analyzed on 1472 consecutive P05154 procedures ( 70 % received abciximab ) performed by high-volume operators at a single institution.(1) Data were adjusted for lack of randomized treatment allocation with the use of a propensity scoring technique . Adjunctive abciximab therapy for P05154 was associated with a significant ( 3.4 % ) reduction in mortality to 6 months . Based on the economic cost-effectiveness concept of cost per life year gained relative to standard therapy,(2,3) abciximab provided a cost-effective survival advantage in high-volume interventional practice that compares very favorably with currently accepted standards . Clinical and procedural demographics associated with increased cost-effectiveness include multivessel coronary intervention , stent deployment , recent ( < 1 week ) myocardial infarction ( MI ) , and impaired left-ventricular ( LV ) function .
