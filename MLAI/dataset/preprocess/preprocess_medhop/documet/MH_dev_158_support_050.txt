TGF-β-elicited induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( P01033 ) -3 expression in fibroblasts involves complex interplay between P84022 , p38α , and P27361 /2 . Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) promotes extracellular matrix deposition by down-regulating the expression of matrix degrading proteinases and upregulating their inhibitors . Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( P01033 ) -3 is an Q13201 -associated specific inhibitor of matrix degrading metalloproteinases . Here , we have characterized the signaling pathways mediating TGF-β-induced expression of P35625 . Basal and TGF-β-induced P35625 mRNA expression was abolished in Q13485 -deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and restoring Q13485 expression rescued the response . Inhibition of Smad signaling by expression of O15105 and dominant negative P84022 completely abolished TGF-β-elicited expression of P35625 in human fibroblasts , whereas overexpression of P84022 enhanced it . Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) activation with PD98059 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity by SB203580 resulted in suppression of TGF-β-induced P35625 expression , indicating that P27361 /2 and p38 MAPK mediate the effect of TGF-β on P35625 expression . Specific activation of p38α and P27361 /2 by constitutively active mutants of MKK3b or Q02750 , respectively , and simultaneous co-expression of P84022 resulted in induction of P35625 expression in the absence of TGF-β indicating that P84022 co-operates with p38 and P27361 /2 in the induction of P35625 expression . These results demonstrate the complex interplay between P84022 , p38α , and P27361 /2 signaling in the regulation of P35625 gene expression in fibroblasts , which may play a role in inflammation , tissue repair , and fibrosis .
