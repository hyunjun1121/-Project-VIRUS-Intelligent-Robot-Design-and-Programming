DNA methylation differences after exposure to prenatal famine are common and timing- and sex-specific . Prenatal famine in humans has been associated with various later-life consequences , depending on the gestational timing of the insult and the sex of the exposed individual . Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these associations . Indeed , animal studies and our early human data on the imprinted P01344 locus indicated a link between prenatal nutritional and DNA methylation . However , it remains unclear how common changes in DNA methylation are and whether they are sex- and timing-specific paralleling the later-life consequences of prenatal famine exposure . To this end , we investigated the methylation of 15 loci implicated in growth and metabolic disease in individuals who were prenatally exposed to a war-time famine in 1944-45 . Methylation of INSIGF was lower among individuals who were periconceptionally exposed to the famine ( n = 60 ) compared with their unexposed same-sex siblings ( P = 2 x 10(-5) ) , whereas methylation of P22301 , P41159 , O95477 , GNASAS and Q9UI56 was higher ( all P < 10(-3) ) . A significant interaction with sex was observed for INSIGF , P41159 and GNASAS . Next , methylation of eight representative loci was compared between 62 individuals exposed late in gestation and their unexposed siblings . Methylation was different for GNASAS ( P = 1.1 x 10(-7) ) and , in men , P41159 ( P = 0.017 ) . Our data indicate that persistent changes in DNA methylation may be a common consequence of prenatal famine exposure and that these changes depend on the sex of the exposed individual and the gestational timing of the exposure .
