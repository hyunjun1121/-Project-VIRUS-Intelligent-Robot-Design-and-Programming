Leukotriene pathway genetics and pharmacogenetics in allergy . Leukotrienes ( LT ) are biologically active lipid mediators known to be involved in allergic inflammation . Leukotrienes have been shown to mediate diverse features of allergic conditions including inflammatory cell chemotaxis/activation and smooth muscle contraction . Cysteinyl leukotrienes ( LTC(4) , LTD(4) and , LTE(4) ) and the dihydroxy leukotriene Q06643 (4) are generated by a series of enzymes/proteins constituting the LT synthetic pathway or P09917 ( P09917 ) pathway . Their function is mediated by interacting with multiple receptors . Leukotriene receptor antagonists ( LTRA ) and LT synthesis inhibitors ( LTSI ) have shown clinical efficacy in asthma and more recently in allergic rhinitis . Despite growing knowledge of leukotriene biology , the molecular regulation of these inflammatory mediators remains to be fully understood . Genes encoding enzymes of the P09917 pathway ( i.e. P09917 , Q16873 and P09960 ) and encoding for LT receptors ( Q9Y271 /2 and LTB4R1/2 ) provide excellent candidates for disease susceptibility and severity ; however , their role remains unclear . Preliminary data also suggest that P09917 pathway/receptor gene polymorphism can predict patient responses to LTSI and LTRA ; however , the exact mechanisms require elucidation . The aim of this review was to summarize the recent advances in the knowledge of these important mediators , focusing on genetic and pharmacogenetic aspects in the context of allergic phenotypes .
