Gene expression profiling in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with hydroxyurea . Using array technology that allows the simultaneous detection of gene expression of hundreds of genes , four patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) were investigated at diagnosis and after starting administration of hydroxyurea . To detect the gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclears and granulocytes Human Cancer cDNA Array ( CLONTECH ) with 588 gene probes was used . Gene expression mononuclear and granulocyte profiles of patients at diagnosis were compared with the control profiles . The significant expression changes observed in most patients seemed to be important . Increased expression of c-jun N-terminal kinase 2 ( P45984 ) , integrin alpha E , P22894 , P14780 was detected in both fractions of most patients . In some samples P12004 , P51858 , MAPK p38 , P13987 increased expressions were found . Significant down-regulation of expression in patients was detected in genes P11802 inhibitor A , Q00577 , notch1 in mononuclears ; P52630 , P42229 , P10276 , Q8WXI8 -1 , junB , caspase 4 in granulocytes ; Q00534 , P35638 , P00533 -3 , cadherin 5 in both fractions . Expression profiles detected in patients at diagnosis did not differ markedly from those after one-week treatment with hydroxyurea . Only in a few genes were significant changes after hydroxyurea administration observed and inter-individual expression differences were rather common .
