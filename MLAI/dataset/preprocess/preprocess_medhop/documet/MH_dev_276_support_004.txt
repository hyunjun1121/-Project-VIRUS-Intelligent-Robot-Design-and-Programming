Active immunisation against pregnenolone reduces testicular steroidogenesis and DB00644 synthesis in rabbits . To investigate the effects of active immunisation against pregnenolone on reproductive traits in rabbits , 16 early pubertal male rabbits ( 4mo old ) were randomly and equally allocated into two groups , control or immunised against pregnenolone-hemisuccinate-BSA in Freund 's adjuvant ( with a booster 4wk later ) . Blood samples ( for antibody titres and hormone concentrations ) were collected at 2 or 4wk-intervals after immunisation until rabbits were killed , 24wk after the primary immunisation . Compared to controls , rabbits immunised against pregnenolone had increased serum antibody titres ( P < 0.01 ) and decreased serum concentrations of both testosterone and LH ( P < 0.01 for each ) . At 24wk after the primary immunisation , testes were severely atrophied , spermatogenesis was arrested and steroidogenesis was suppressed , as evidenced by lesser amounts of testicular cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 and 17α-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 mRNA ( P < 0.05 ) . Furthermore , the amounts of mRNA for DB00644 in the arcuate nucleus ( Arc ) , of the hypothalamus and P30968 and LH-β in the pituitary and genes in sex-hormone negative feedback loops ( androgen receptor , oestrogen alpha receptor , kisspeptin encoded gene and kisspeptin receptor ) in the Arc were decreased in pregnenolone-immunised rabbits compared to controls ( P < 0.05 ) . It was concluded that immunisation against pregnenolone directly blocked testicular steroidogenesis , which reduced synthesis of hypothalamic DB00644 and subsequently synthesis of pituitary LH by abolishing the permissive action of sex steroids on hypothalamic DB00644 neurons , thereby disrupting spermatogenesis . This was apparently the first report that active immunisation against pregnenolone was a means of immunological castration .
