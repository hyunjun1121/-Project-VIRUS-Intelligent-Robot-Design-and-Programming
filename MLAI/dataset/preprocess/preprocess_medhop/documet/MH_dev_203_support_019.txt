Red meat and poultry , cooking practices , genetic susceptibility and risk of prostate cancer : results from a multiethnic case-control study . Red meat , processed and unprocessed , has been considered a potential prostate cancer ( DB11245 ) risk factor ; epidemiological evidence , however , is inconclusive . An association between meat intake and DB11245 may be due to potent chemical carcinogens that are generated when meats are cooked at high temperatures . We investigated the association between red meat and poultry intake and localized and advanced DB11245 taking into account cooking practices and polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize carcinogens that accumulate in cooked meats . We analyzed data for 1096 controls , 717 localized and 1140 advanced cases from the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study , a multiethnic , population-based case-control study . We examined nutrient density-adjusted intake of red meat and poultry and tested for effect modification by 12 SNPs and 2 copy number variants in 10 carcinogen metabolism genes : P09211 , P35354 , P05177 , P05181 , P07099 , Q16678 , P19224 , NAT2 , P09488 and P30711 . We observed a positive association between risk of advanced DB11245 and high intake of red meat cooked at high temperatures ( trend P = 0.026 ) , cooked by pan-frying ( trend P = 0.035 ) , and cooked until well-done ( trend P = 0.013 ) . An inverse association was observed for baked poultry and advanced DB11245 risk ( trend P = 0.023 ) . A gene-by-diet interaction was observed between an SNP in the P35354 gene and the estimated levels of meat mutagens ( interaction P = 0.008 ) . Our results support a role for carcinogens that accumulate in meats cooked at high temperatures as potential DB11245 risk factors , and may support a role for heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) in DB11245 etiology .
