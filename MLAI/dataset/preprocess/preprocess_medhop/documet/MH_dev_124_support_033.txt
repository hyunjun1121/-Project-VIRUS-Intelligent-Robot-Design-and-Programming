Autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets ( P30518 ) mutations stabilize Q9GZV9 . BACKGROUND : The gene for the renal phosphate wasting disorder autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets ( P30518 ) is Q9GZV9 , which encodes a secreted protein related to the fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) . We previously detected missense mutations R176Q , R179W , and R179Q in Q9GZV9 from P30518 kindreds . The mutations replace R residues within a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase ( Q969E3 ) cleavage site 176RHTR-179 ( RXXR motif ) . The goal of these studies was to determine if the P30518 mutations lead to protease resistance of Q9GZV9 . METHODS : The P30518 mutations were introduced into human Q9GZV9 cDNA clones with or without an N-terminal FLAG tag by site-directed mutagenesis and were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells . Protein expression was determined by Western analyses . RESULTS : Antibodies directed toward the C-terminal portion of Q9GZV9 revealed that the native Q9GZV9 protein resolved as 32 kD and 12 kD species in HEK293 conditioned media ; however , the three mutated proteins were detected only as the 32 kD band . An N-terminal FLAG-tagged native Q9GZV9 resolved as two bands of 36 kD and 26 kD when detected with a FLAG antibody , whereas the R176Q mutant resolved primarily as the 36 kD protein species . Cleavage of Q9GZV9 was not enhanced by extracellular incubation of Q9GZV9 with HEK293 cells . Native and mutant FGF-23s bound heparin . CONCLUSIONS : Q9GZV9 proteins containing the P30518 mutations are secreted , and produce polypeptides less sensitive to protease cleavage than wild-type Q9GZV9 . Therefore , the P30518 mutations may protect Q9GZV9 from proteolysis , thereby potentially elevating circulating concentrations of Q9GZV9 and leading to phosphate wasting in P30518 patients .
