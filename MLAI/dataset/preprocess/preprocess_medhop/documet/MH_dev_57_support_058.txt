Histone acetyltransferase-dependent chromatin remodeling and the vascular clock . Rhythmic gene expression is central to the circadian control of physiology in mammals . Transcriptional activation of Per and Cry genes by heterodimeric bHLH- DB00233 proteins is a key event in the feedback loop that drives rhythmicity ; however , the mechanism is not clearly understood . Here we show the transcriptional coactivators and histone acetyltransferases , p300/CBP , Q92831 , and Q9Y6Q9 associate with the bHLH- DB00233 proteins , O15516 and Q99743 , to regulate positively clock gene expression . Furthermore , Cry2 mediated repression of Q99743 : O00327 is overcome by overexpression of p300 in transactivation assays . Accordingly , p300 exhibits a circadian time-dependent association with Q99743 in the vasculature , which precedes peak expression of target genes . In addition , a rhythm in core histone H3 acetylation on the mPer1 promoter in vivo correlates with the cyclical expression of their mRNAs . Temporal coactivator recruitment and O60235 -dependent chromatin remodeling on the promoter of clock controlled genes in the vasculature permits the mammalian clock to orchestrate circadian gene expression .
