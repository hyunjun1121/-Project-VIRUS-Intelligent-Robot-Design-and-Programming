DB00435 modulates the frog heart ventricle morphodynamics . The aim of this work was to investigate in the avascular heart of the frog Rana esculenta the influence of nitric oxide ( NO ) on ventricular systolic and diastolic functions by using a novel image analysis technique . The external volume variations of the whole ventricle were monitored during the heart cycle by video acquisition ( visible light ) and analysed by an appropriately developed software with a specific formula for irregular convex solids . The system , which measures the rate of volume changes and the ejection fraction , directly determined the volumetric behaviour of the working frog heart after stimulation or inhibition of NOS-NOcGMP pathway . End-diastolic volume ( EDVext ) , end-systolic volume ( ESVext ) , contraction and relaxation velocities ( dV/dtsys and dV/dtdia , respectively ) , stroke volume ( SV ) and ejection fraction ( EF ) , were measured before and after perfusion with NOS substrate ( L-arginine ) , NO donor ( SIN-1 ) , cGMP analogue (8-Br-cGMP),NOS inhibitors ( NG-monomethyl-L-arginine , L-NMMA ; L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine , L-NIO ; DB02207 ,7-NI ) and guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ( ODQ ) . The results showed that NO reduces ventricular systolicfunction improving diastolic filling , while NOS inhibition increases contractility impairing ventricular filling capacity . The presence of activated P29474 ( p- P29474 ) was morphologically documented , further supporting that the mechanical activity of the ventricular pump in frog is influenced by a tonic release of NOS-generated NO .
