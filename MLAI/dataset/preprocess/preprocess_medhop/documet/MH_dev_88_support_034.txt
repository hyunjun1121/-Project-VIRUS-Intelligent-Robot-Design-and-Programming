Induction , binding specificity and function of human Q9Y6W8 . Recently , we have identified the inducible co-stimulator ( Q9Y6W8 ) , an activation-dependent , T cell-specific cell surface molecule related to P10747 and P16410 . Detailed analysis of human Q9Y6W8 presented here shows that it is a 55-60-kDa homodimer with differently N-glycosylated subunits of 27 and 29 kDa . Q9Y6W8 requires both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin for full induction , and is sensitive to DB00091 . Q9Y6W8 is up-regulated early on all T cells , including the P10747 - subset , and continues to be expressed into later phases of T cell activation . On stimulation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells , the P10747 / P33681 , but not the P29965 / P25942 pathway is critically involved in the induction of Q9Y6W8 . Q9Y6W8 does not bind to P33681 -1 or P33681 -2 , and P10747 does not bind to O75144 ; thus the P10747 and Q9Y6W8 pathways do not cross-interact on the cell surface . In vivo , Q9Y6W8 is expressed in the medulla of the fetal and newborn thymus , in the T cell zones of tonsils and lymph nodes , and in the apical light zones of germinal centers ( predominant expression ) . Functionally , Q9Y6W8 co-induces a variety of cytokines including P05112 , P05113 , P05231 , P01579 , P01375 , GM- P04141 , but not P60568 , and superinduces P22301 . Furthermore , Q9Y6W8 co-stimulation prevents the apoptosis of pre-activated T cells . The human Q9Y6W8 gene maps to chromosome 2q33 - 34 .
