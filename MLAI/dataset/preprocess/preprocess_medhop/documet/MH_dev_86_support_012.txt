P05231 sensitizes prostate cancer to the antiproliferative effect of IFNα2 through Q00978 . Development and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) are associated with chronic inflammation . The cytokine interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) can influence progression , differentiation , survival , and angiogenesis of PCa . To identify novel pathways that are triggered by P05231 , we performed a gene expression profiling of two PCa cell lines , LNCaP and MDA PCa 2b , treated with 5 ng/ml P05231 . Interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factor 9 ( Q00978 ) was identified as one of the most prevalent P05231 -regulated genes in both cell lines . Q00978 is a mediator of type I IFN signaling and acts together with P42224 and 2 to activate transcription of IFN-responsive genes . The P05231 regulation of Q00978 was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot respectively in both cell lines and could be blocked by the anti- P05231 antibody DB09036 . Three PCa cell lines , PC3 , Du-145 , and LNCaP- P05231 + , with an autocrine P05231 loop displayed high expression of Q00978 . A tissue microarray with 36 PCa tissues showed that Q00978 protein expression is moderately elevated in malignant areas and positively correlates with the tissue expression of P05231 . Downregulation and overexpression of Q00978 provided evidence for an IFN-independent role of Q00978 in cellular proliferation of different PCa cell lines . Furthermore , expression of Q00978 was essential to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFNα2 . We concluded that P05231 is an inducer of Q00978 expression in PCa and a sensitizer for the antiproliferative effects of IFNα2 .
