Platelet-associated anti- P08514 -IIIa autoantibodies in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura recognizing epitopes close to the ligand-binding site of glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb . Localization of epitopes for platelet-associated ( PA ) anti- P08514 -IIIa ( alpha(IIb)beta(3) ) autoantibodies in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura remains elusive . Previous studies suggest that PA antibodies recognize the tertiary structure of intact glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb-IIIa . To localize their epitopes using antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , the reactivity of 34 PA anti- P08514 -IIIa antibodies was examined with recombinant P08514 -IIIa having a defect in ligand-binding sites in either P08514 or P05106 , and no major conformational change was induced : KO variant P08514 -IIIa was attributed to a 2-amino acid insertion between residues 160 and 161 in the W3 4-1 loop in P08514 , and P62158 variant P08514 -IIIa was attributed to D119Y in P05106 . In one third ( 11 of 34 ) of the patients , PA antibodies showed a marked decrease ( less than 50 % ) in reactivity with KO compared with wild-type P08514 -IIIa . Their reactivity was also impaired against GPIIbD163A-IIIa . In sharp contrast , they reacted normally with P62158 P08514 -IIIa . OP-G2 , a ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody , markedly inhibited their binding to P08514 -IIIa in patients with impaired binding to KO P08514 -IIIa , but small P08514 -IIIa antagonists did not . In addition , a newly developed sensitive ELISA indicated that autoantibodies showing impaired binding to KO are more potent inhibitors for fibrinogen binding . The present data suggest that certain PA anti- P08514 -IIIa autoantibodies recognize epitopes close to the ligand-binding site in P08514 , but not in P05106 .
