[ Regulation of P04271 expression during long term potentiation ] . In this study , contributions of intracellular regulatory cascades in the induction of P04271 expression in rat hippocampal P00915 area during long term posttetanic potentiation ( LTP ) were estimated . The activation of transcription factor p53 ( positive regulator of P04271 transcription ) by nutlin-3 increased the basal content of P04271 mRNA up to 151 % of the control level , which was significantly lower than its content in tetanized slices ( 280 % ) . Therefore , p53 seems to be not unique transcription factor upregulating P04271 expression during LTP . The inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases ( CaMKs ) KN-93 fully blocked the increase of P04271 mRNA after tetanization , while KN-92 ( inactive analogue of KN-93 ) was ineffective . The inhibitor of CaMKII and receptor tyrosine kinases DB02152 essentially suppressed P04271 expression during LTP , the inhibition of MAPK p38 or P51812 moderately decreased , and the inhibition of Q02750 did not influence P04271 mRNA content . Thus , CaMKs play a key role in the induction of P04271 expression during LTP .
