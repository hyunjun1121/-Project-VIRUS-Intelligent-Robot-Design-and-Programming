Contribution of the Q9H244 receptor-mediated pathway to platelet hyperreactivity in hypercholesterolemia . BACKGROUND : In hypercholesterolemia , platelets demonstrate increased reactivity and promote the development of cardiovascular disease . OBJECTIVE : This study was carried out to investigate the contribution of the ADP receptor Q9H244 -mediated pathway to platelet hyperreactivity due to hypercholesterolemia . METHODS : P01130 -deficient mice and C57Bl/6 wild-type mice were fed on normal chow and high-fat ( Western or Paigen ) diets for 8 weeks to generate differently elevated cholesterol levels . Q9H244 receptor-induced functional responses via G(i) signaling were studied ex vivo when washed murine platelets were activated by 2MeSADP and PAR4 agonist AYPGKF in the presence and absence of indomethacin . Platelet aggregation and secretion , α(IIb)β(3) receptor activation and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) and Akt were analyzed . RESULTS : Plasma cholesterol levels ranged from 69 ± 10 to 1011 ± 185 mg dL(-1) depending on diet in mice with different genotypes . Agonist-dependent aggregation , dense and α-granule secretion and JON/A binding were gradually and significantly ( P < 0.05 ) augmented at low agonist concentration in correlation with the increasing plasma cholesterol levels , even if elevated thromboxane generation was blocked . These functional responses were induced via increased levels of G(i) -mediated P29323 and Akt phosphorylation in hypercholesterolemic mice vs. normocholesterolemic animals . In addition , blocking of the Q9H244 receptor by AR-C69931MX ( DB06441 ) resulted in strongly reduced platelet aggregation in mice with elevated cholesterol levels compared with normocholesterolemic controls . CONCLUSIONS : These data revealed that the Q9H244 receptor pathway was substantially involved in platelet hyperreactivity associated with mild and severe hypercholesterolemia .
