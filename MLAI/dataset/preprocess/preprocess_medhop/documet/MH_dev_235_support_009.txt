Mutational profiling of kinases in glioblastoma . BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain tumor for which no cure is available . To identify new therapeutic targets , we performed a mutation analysis of kinase genes in glioblastoma . METHODS : Database mining and a literature search identified 76 kinases that have been found to be mutated at least twice in multiple cancer types before . Among those we selected 34 kinase genes for mutation analysis . We also included O75874 , P48735 , P60484 , P04637 and P01111 , genes that are known to be mutated at considerable frequencies in glioblastoma . In total , 174 exons of 39 genes in 113 glioblastoma samples from 109 patients and 16 high-grade glioma ( HGG ) cell lines were sequenced . RESULTS : Our mutation analysis led to the identification of 148 non-synonymous somatic mutations , of which 25 have not been reported before in glioblastoma . Somatic mutations were found in P04637 , P60484 , O75874 , P42336 , P00533 , P15056 , P29320 , P01111 , P37173 , P36888 and Q96S38 . Mapping the mutated genes into known signaling pathways revealed that the large majority of them plays a central role in the PI3K-AKT pathway . CONCLUSIONS : The knowledge that at least 50 % of glioblastoma tumors display mutational activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway should offer new opportunities for the rational development of therapeutic approaches for glioblastomas . However , due to the development of resistance mechanisms , kinase inhibition studies targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway for relapsing glioblastoma have mostly failed thus far . Other therapies should be investigated , targeting early events in gliomagenesis that involve both kinases and non-kinases .
