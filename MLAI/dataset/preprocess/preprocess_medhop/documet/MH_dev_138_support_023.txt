Genetics of late-onset Alzheimer 's disease : update from the alzgene database and analysis of shared pathways . The genetics of late-onset Alzheimer 's disease ( LOAD ) has taken impressive steps forwards in the last few years . To date , more than six-hundred genes have been linked to the disorder . However , only a minority of them are supported by a sufficient level of evidence . This review focused on such genes and analyzed shared biological pathways . Genetic markers were selected from a web-based collection ( Alzgene ) . For each SNP in the database , it was possible to perform a meta-analysis . The quality of studies was assessed using criteria such as size of research samples , heterogeneity across studies , and protection from publication bias . This produced a list of 15 top-rated genes : P02649 , P10909 , Q13492 , Q2M3D2 , O00499 , P17927 , Q92673 , Q13470 , P10145 , P01130 , P01034 , P17787 , Q8WY21 , P01375 , and P41597 . A systematic analysis of gene ontology terms associated with each marker showed that most genes were implicated in cholesterol metabolism , intracellular transport of beta-amyloid precursor , and autophagy of damaged organelles . Moreover , the impact of these genes on complement cascade and cytokine production highlights the role of inflammatory response in AD pathogenesis . Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are prominent issues in AD genetics , but they are not specifically featured in the Alzgene database .
