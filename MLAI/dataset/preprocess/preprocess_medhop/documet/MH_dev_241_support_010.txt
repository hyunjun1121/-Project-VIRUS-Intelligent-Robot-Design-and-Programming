Interactions of alpha- , beta- , and theta-defensins with influenza A virus and surfactant protein D . We have reported that the alpha-defensins human neutrophil peptides ( HNP ) -1 and HNP-2 neutralize and aggregate influenza A virus ( IAV ) and promote uptake of IAV by neutrophils . These alpha-defensins were also shown to bind to surfactant protein ( SP ) -D and reduce its antiviral activity . In this study , we examined retrocyclin (RC)1 and RC2 , humanized versions of the antiviral theta-defensins found in the leukocytes of certain nonhuman primates . Q9HC52 was just as effective as P59665 -3 in neutralizing IAV , and RC2 and RC101 ( an analog of Q9HC52 ) were more effective . In contrast , human beta-defensins ( HBDs ) showed less neutralizing activity . Human defensins 5 and 6 ( mainly produced by intestinal Paneth cells ) had viral neutralizing activity similar to P59665 -3 . Like P59665 -3 , RCs induced viral aggregation and promoted the uptake of IAV by neutrophils . We used surface plasmon resonance to evaluate binding of defensins to P35247 . HBDs , Q9UBN7 , and P12838 bound minimally to P35247 . P59665 -3 and RCs bound P35247 with high affinity ; however , unlike P59665 and HNP-2 , RCs did not inhibit P35247 antiviral activity . HBDs also did not inhibit antiviral activity of P35247 . Given their strong neutralizing activity and compatibility with P35247 , RCs may provide attractive prototypes for designing therapeutics that can prevent or treat respiratory infections caused by IAV .
