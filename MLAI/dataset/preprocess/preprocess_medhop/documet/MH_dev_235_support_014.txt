Transcriptional regulation of Q96NT5 by O43474 , HNF4α , Q99626 and C/EBPα : implication in its site-specific expression in the small intestine . Q96NT5 ( Q96NT5 ) , which is responsible for the intestinal uptake of folates and analogs , is expressed only in the proximal region in the small intestine . The present study was to examine its transcriptional regulation , which may be involved in such a unique expression profile and potentially in its alteration , using dual-luciferase reporter assays in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells . The luciferase activity derived from the reporter construct containing the 5'-flanking sequence of -1695/+96 of the human Q96NT5 gene was enhanced most extensively by the introduction of Krüppel-like factor 4 ( O43474 ) . The O43474 -induced luciferase activity was further enhanced by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( HNF4α ) synergistically . To the contrary , caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 ( Q99626 ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α ( C/EBPα ) extensively suppressed the luciferase activity induced by O43474 alone and also that induced by O43474 and HNF4α . Western blot analysis using the rat small intestine indicated uniform expression of O43474 along the intestinal tract , proximal-oriented expression of HNF4α , distal-oriented expression of Q99626 and C/EBPα . These results suggest that the activity of Q96NT5 promoter is basically induced by O43474 and the gradiented expression profile of Q96NT5 may be at least in part accounted for by those of HNF4α , Q99626 and C/EBPα .
