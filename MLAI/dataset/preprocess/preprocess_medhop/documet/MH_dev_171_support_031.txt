Tofacitinab in renal transplantation . DB08895 ( tositinib , CP-690,550 ) is a small molecule inhibitor of Janus associated kinases , primarily P52333 and O60674 , which inhibits cytokine signaling through the IL-2RÎ³ chain . In this article , we review the mechanism of action of tofacitinib , and pre-clinical and clinical data regarding its use in solid organ transplantation thus far . It is hoped that tofacitinib may form the basis for calcineurin-free immunosuppression , improving renal function while eliminating calcineurin inhibitor renal toxicity . Current studies suggest that tofacitinib is an effective immunosuppressive agent for renal transplantation , but it 's use in current protocols carries an increased risk of CMV , BK , and EBV viral infection , anemia and leukopenia , and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder .
