Q9UD71 and inhibitor-1 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells . P01308 secretion from pancreatic beta-cells has to be tightly regulated to ensure accurate glucose homeostasis . The capacity of beta-cells to respond to extracellular stimulation is determined by several signaling pathways . One important feature of these pathways is phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of a wide range of cellular substrates . Protein phosphatase 1 ( P50391 ) is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that controls a multitude of physiological processes . We have investigated the expression and cellular distribution of two endogenous inhibitors of P50391 activity in beta-cells . RT-PCR , Western blotting , and immunohistochemistry showed that Q9UD71 and inhibitor-1 are present in insulin-secreting endocrine beta-cells . Subcellular fractionation of mouse islets revealed that both P50391 inhibitors predominantly localized to cytosol-enriched fractions . Inhibitor-1 was also present in fractions containing plasma membrane-associated proteins . These data indicate a potential role for Q9UD71 and inhibitor-1 in the regulation of P50391 activity in pancreatic beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling .
