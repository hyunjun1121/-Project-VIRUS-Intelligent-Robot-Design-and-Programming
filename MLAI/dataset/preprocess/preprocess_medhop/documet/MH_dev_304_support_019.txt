Anti-allergic function and regulatory mechanisms of KR62980 in allergen-induced airway inflammation . The ligand-activated transcription factor , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )gamma , and its ligands inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells , thus exerting anti-inflammatory activity . As a non-thiazolidinedione PPARgamma ligand , KR62980 has anti-diabetic and anti-adipogenic activities , but its anti-inflammatory function has yet to be characterized . In this study , we investigated the functions and mechanisms of KR62980 in the activation and differentiation of P01730 + T helper ( Th ) cells by comparing its effects with those of a thiazolidinedione PPARgamma ligand , rosiglitazone . KR62980 dose-dependently and significantly suppressed TCR-triggered Th cell proliferation by suppressing P60568 /IL-2Ralpha-mediated signaling . Both KR62980 and rosiglitazone suppressed IFNgamma production in a dose-dependent manner , whereas P05112 gene expression was specifically suppressed by only KR62980 . In addition , sustained KR62980 treatment diminished Th2 cytokine production by inhibiting c-Maf expression . In vivo administration of KR62980 in a model of allergic asthma significantly attenuated eotaxin-induced eosinophil infiltration , allergic cytokine production and collagen deposition in the lung . KR62980 also decreased goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway and mucous cell metaplasia in nasal epithelium , concurrent with decreases of allergic Th2 cytokines and Q16552 in the draining lymph node . In conclusion , a novel PPARgamma ligand , KR62980 , suppresses in vitro Th2 cell differentiation and attenuates in vivo OVA-induced airway inflammation , suggesting a beneficial role for KR62980 in the treatment of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis .
