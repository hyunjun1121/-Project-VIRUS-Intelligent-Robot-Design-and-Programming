Indirubin-3'- ( 2,3 dihydroxypropyl ) -oximether ( E804 ) is a potent modulator of LPS-stimulated macrophage functions . Indirubin is a deep-red bis-indole isomer of indigo blue , both of which are biologically active ingredients in Danggui Longhui Wan , an ancient Chinese herbal tea mixture used to treat neoplasia and chronic inflammation and to enhance detoxification of xenobiotics . Multiple indirubin derivatives have been synthesized and shown to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) and glycogen-synthase kinase ( GSK-3β ) with varying degrees of potency . Several indirubins are also aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( P35869 ) agonists , with P35869 -associated activities covering a wide range of potencies , depending on molecular structure . This study examined the effects of indirubin-3'- ( 2,3 dihydroxypropyl ) -oximether ( E804 ) , a novel indirubin with potent P40763 inhibitory properties , on basal and LPS-inducible activities in murine RAW264.7 macrophages . Using a focused commercial qRT-PCR array platform ( SuperArray® ) , the effects of E804 on expression of a suite of genes associated with stress and toxicity were determined . Most genes up-regulated by LPS treatment were suppressed by E804 ; including LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptors , apoptosis control genes , and oxidative stress response genes . Using qRT-PCR as a follow up to the commercial arrays , E804 treatment suppressed LPS-induced P35354 , P35228 , P05231 and P22301 gene expression , though the effects on P35228 and P35354 protein expression were less dramatic . E804 also inhibited LPS-induced secretion of P05231 and P22301 . Functional endpoints , including P35228 and lysozyme enzymatic activity , phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads , and intracellular killing of bacteria , were also examined , and in each experimental condition E804 suppressed activities . Collectively , these results indicate that E804 is a potent modulator of pro-inflammatory profiles in LPS-treated macrophages .
