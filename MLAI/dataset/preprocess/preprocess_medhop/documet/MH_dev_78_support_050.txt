The effect of cilostazol and aspirin pre-treatment against subsequent transient focal cerebral ischemia in rat . OBJECTIVES : Among several anti-platelet drugs to prevent recurrent stroke , cilostazol has shown various effects besides its anti-platelet activity . We examined whether 7 days of oral administration of cilostazol protects against subsequent cerebral ischemia , and whether or not the effect of combination therapy with aspirin is more protective . METHODS : We used Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats and assigned them to four groups : vehicle , aspirin , cilostazol , and aspirin plus cilostazol combination therapy . After oral administration of anti-platelets for 7 days , we performed transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) for 90 minutes , and examined infarct volume , neurological symptoms , and regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) . Immunostaining of Bax , Bcl-2 , TUNEL , 4-HNE , 8-OHdG , and P35354 was performed 24 hours after ischemia . RESULTS : The cilostazol group and the combination therapy group showed significant decreases of infarct volume and significant improvements of rCBF during ischemia , compared with the vehicle or aspirin group . Significant decreases of Bax , TUNEL , 8-OHdG , and 4-HNE expression in the combination therapy group , compared with those in the vehicle or aspirin group , were shown in the boundary zone . P35354 expression was unexpectedly increased in the combination therapy group . DISCUSSION : DB00945 co-administration did not inhibit this effect . The addition of the oral administration of cilostazol either alone or with aspirin administration may be beneficial for subsequent cerebral ischemic damage in terms of reducing infarct volume , improving rCBF during ischemia , inhibiting the apoptotic pathway , and reducing oxidative stress .
