R306465 is a novel potent inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases with broad-spectrum antitumoral activity against solid and haematological malignancies . R306465 is a novel hydroxamate-based histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor with broad-spectrum antitumour activity against solid and haematological malignancies in preclinical models . R306465 was found to be a potent inhibitor of Q13547 and -8 ( class I ) in vitro . It rapidly induced histone 3 ( H3 ) acetylation and strongly upregulated expression of p21waf1,cip1 , a downstream component of Q13547 signalling , in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells . R306465 showed class I HDAC isotype selectivity as evidenced by poor inhibition of Q9UBN7 ( class IIb ) confirmed by the absence of downregulation of Hsp90 chaperone c-raf protein expression and tubulin acetylation . This distinguished it from other HDAC inhibitors currently in clinical development that were either more potent towards Q9UBN7 ( e.g. vorinostat ) or had a broader HDAC inhibition spectrum ( e.g. DB06603 ) . R306465 potently inhibited cell proliferation of all main solid tumour indications , including ovarian , lung , colon , breast and prostate cancer cell lines , with IC50 values ranging from 30 to 300 nM . Haematological cell lines , including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , acute myeloid leukaemia , chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia , chronic myeloid leukaemia , lymphoma and myeloma , were potently inhibited at a similar concentration range . R306465 induced apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis in cell-based assays and had potent oral in vivo antitumoral activity in xenograft models . Once-daily oral administration of R306465 at well-tolerated doses inhibited the growth of A2780 ovarian , H460 lung and HCT116 colon carcinomas in immunodeficient mice . The high activity of R306465 in cell-based assays and in vivo after oral administration makes R306465 a promising novel antitumoral agent with potential applicability in a broad spectrum of human malignancies .
