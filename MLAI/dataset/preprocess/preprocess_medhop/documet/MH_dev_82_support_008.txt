[ Preparation of NK-enriched Q96QP1 cells -- their potential cytotoxic and ADCC activities ] . We examined several culture methods to induce proliferation of natural killer ( NK ) cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . In the presence of P60568 , a remarkable proliferation of NK cells was observed when PBMC were co-cultured with DB00305 -treated K562 , which is known as a highly sensitive in vitro target cell for the NK assay . Addition of OK-432 or P01375 and P01584 also induced marked NK proliferation in a dose dependent manner . These NK-enriched lymphokine activated killer ( Q96QP1 ) cells showed highly cytotoxic activities against various MHC class I positive or negative tumor cells . They also showed potent ADCC activities against Herceptin-coated SK-BR-3 , a P04626 /neu positive breast cancer cell line . These results indicated that NK-enriched Q96QP1 cells are potent effector cells , and suggested novel therapeutic strategies for nonspecific immunotherapy as well as target immunotherapy in combination with anticancer antibodies , such as Herceptin .
