DB00207 selectively reduces tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells . DB00207 ( AZM ) ameliorates lung function in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients . This macrolide has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties as well as other effects potentially relevant for therapy of CF . In this study , we utilized three CF ( IB3-1 , 16HBE14o- Q9NTI5 , and 2CFSMEo- ) and two isogenic non-CF ( C38 and 16HBE14o- S1 ) airway epithelial cell lines to investigate whether AZM could reduce tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) mRNA and protein levels by real-time quantitative PCR analysis and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , respectively . We studied the effects on the DNA binding of NF-kappaB and specificity protein 1 ( Sp1 ) by an ELISA . Non-CF cells express significantly lower P01375 mRNA and protein levels than an isogenic CF cell line . In CF cells , AZM treatment causes a 30 % reduction of P01375 mRNA levels ( P < 0.05 ) and a 45 % decrease in P01375 secretion ( P < 0.05 ) , reaching approximately the levels of the untreated isogenic non-CF cells . In CF cells , NF-kappaB and Sp1 DNA binding activities were also significantly decreased ( about 45 and 60 % , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) after AZM treatment . DB01321 , a macrolide lacking clinically described anti-inflammatory effects , was ineffective . Finally , AZM did not alter the mRNA expression levels of interleukin-6 , a proinflammatory molecule not differentially expressed in CF and isogenic non-CF cells . The results of our study support the anti-inflammatory activities of this macrolide , since we show that AZM reduced the levels of P01375 and propose inhibitions of NF-kappaB and Sp1 DNA binding as possible mechanisms of this effect .
