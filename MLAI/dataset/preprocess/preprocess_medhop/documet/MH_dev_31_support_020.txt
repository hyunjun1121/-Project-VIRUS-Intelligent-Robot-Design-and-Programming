Donor pre-treatment with everolimus or cyclosporine does not reduce ischaemia-reperfusion injury in a rat kidney transplant model . BACKGROUND : Immunosuppressive agents have been investigated in renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) and have frequently demonstrated a beneficial effect . Most studies focused on treatment of the recipient at the time of transplantation . Pre-treatment of these organs before injury ( pharmacological pre-conditioning ) may particularly protect these organs . This study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of donor pre-treatment with cyclosporine ( DB00091 ) or the P42345 inhibitor everolimus or their combination against IRI during renal transplantation in a rat model . METHODS : Donors received vehicle , DB00091 ( 5 mg/kg ) , everolimus ( 0.5 mg/kg ) or CsA + everolimus . Two oral doses were administered to the donors at 24 h and again at 6 h prior to donor kidney removal . Syngeneic rat kidneys were preserved in UW solution for 24 h prior to transplantation . After 24 h of reperfusion , blood and tissue samples were collected from recipients for further analysis . RESULTS : Renal functions as determined by creatinine and necrosis scores were not different between the experimental groups . Cleaved caspase-3 , heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) , tumor-necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -Î± ) and nitrotyrosine protein levels were not statistically different between the four treatment groups at 24 h post-transplantation . Blood NMR analysis on metabolic markers for IRI reveals no beneficial effects of donor pre-treatment on the 24-h outcome in transplantation . CONCLUSIONS : When given alone or as a combination to donors before organ recovery , cyclosporine or everolimus does not appear to ameliorate IRI .
