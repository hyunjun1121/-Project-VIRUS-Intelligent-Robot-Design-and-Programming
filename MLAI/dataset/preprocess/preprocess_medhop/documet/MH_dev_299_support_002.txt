Regulation of Con A-dependent cytokine production from P01730 + and CD8+ T lymphocytes by autosecretion of histamine . OBJECTIVES : Previously we have shown that both P01730 + T cells and CD8+ T cells produce histamine when activated with Con A . The aim of this study was to examine whether cytokine production by these cells is regulated by autosecretion of histamine . MATERIALS : P01730 + and CD8+ T cells were separated from spleen cells of C57BL/6 mice and mice lacking the H1 receptor ( P35367 ) or P25021 , using anti- P01730 +- and anti-CD8+-coupled magnetic beads , respectively . RESULTS : Depletion of the P35367 resulted in decreases in the release of P60568 and P22301 from both P01730 + and CD8+ cells and increases in the release of P05112 from P01730 + T cells and P01579 from CD8+ cells . Mice lacking the P25021 showed up-regulation of P01579 secretion from CD8+ cells and of P05112 from P01730 + and CD8+ T cells . Release of P60568 and P22301 from P01730 + as well as CD8+ cells was down-regulated in these mice . Both P01730 + and CD8+ T cell fractions synthesized histamine , which was enhanced in the P35367 -deficient CD8+ T cells . Treatment of the cells with alpha-fluoromethyl-histidine , a specific inhibitor of HDC , or histaminase increased P01579 from CD8+ cells , whereas it had no appreciable effect on P05112 secretion from P01730 + cells . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that cytokine production by P01730 + and CD8+ T lymphocytes is regulated by autosecretion of histamine .
