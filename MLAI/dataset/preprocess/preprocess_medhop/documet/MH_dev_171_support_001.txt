Cytokine-induced human P01579 -secreting effector-memory Th cells in chronic autoimmune inflammation . T-helper ( Th ) cells activated by cytokines in the absence of T-cell receptor ligation are suspected to participate in inflammatory processes by production of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . Still , the relevance of such a mechanism has not been addressed in humans . Here we demonstrate that a subset of human effector-memory Th cells expressing functional interleukin-12R ( IL-12R ) , IL-18Ralpha , and P51681 ex vivo can be induced to secrete P01579 by cytokines signaling via the IL-2R common gamma-chain in combination with IL-12 and Q14116 . Cytokine-driven P01579 production depends on P52333 - and p38 mitogen-activated kinase signals and is sensitive to suppression by CD25(++) regulatory T cells . Contrary to P01579 (+) Th cells induced upon antigen-specific stimulation , their cytokine-activated counterparts characteristically lack expression of costimulator 4-1BB ( Q07011 ) . Strikingly , the majority of Th cells infiltrating inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients is equipped with receptors prerequisite for cytokine-induced P01579 secretion . Among these cells , we detected a substantial fraction that secretes P01579 directly ex vivo but lacks 4-1BB expression , indicating that cytokine-induced P01579 (+) Th cells operate in autoimmune inflammation . Our data provide a rationale for how human effector-memory Thcells can participate in perpetuating inflammatory processes in autoimmunity even in the absence of T-cell receptor ligation .
