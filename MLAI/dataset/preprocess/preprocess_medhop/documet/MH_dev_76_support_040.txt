Clinical utility of calcimimetics targeting the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) . Calcimimetics , which activate the extracellular calcium ( Ca(o)(2+) ) -sensing receptor in the parathyroid and other tissues participating in Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis , were the first described allosteric activators of a G-protein-coupled receptor . DB01012 , the only calcimimetic currently approved for human use , is used clinically for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism ( e.g. , overactivity of parathyroid glands ) in patients being dialyzed for chronic kidney disease . By sensitizing the parathyroids to Ca(o)(2+) , cinacalcet lowers the circulating parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level . It also reduces serum calcium and phosphate , changes increasing the percentage of patients achieving the guidelines recommended by the National Kidney Foundation ( NKF ) for these minerals . Studies are underway addressing whether better adherence to these guidelines in patients receiving cinacalcet reduces cardiovascular disease and related mortality , which are both common is the dialysis population . The second approved use of cinacalcet is for treating hypercalcemia in patients with inoperable parathyroid carcinoma . In this setting , it provides the first medical therapy chronically lowering serum calcium concentration in this condition , albeit not to normal in most patients . Its effect on the long-term prognosis of these patients , if any , is presently unclear . " Off-label " administration of cinacalcet [ i.e. , not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ] effectively lowers serum calcium and/or PTH in various other forms of hyperparathyroidism and increases serum phosphate in renal phosphate-wasting syndromes by reducing PTH-induced phosphaturia . In the future , the drug could conceivably be utilized to modulate the activity of the P41180 in other tissues ( i.e. , kidney , colon ) in therapeutically desirable ways .
