P14416 desensitization by dopamine or corticotropin releasing factor in ventral tegmental area neurons is associated with increased glutamate release . Neurons of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are the source of dopaminergic ( DAergic ) input to important brain regions related to addiction . Prolonged exposure of these VTA neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) causes a time-dependent decrease in DA-induced inhibition , a complex desensitization called DA inhibition reversal ( P30518 ) . P30518 is mediated by conventional protein kinase C ( cPKC ) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1-like DA receptors , or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of some Gq-linked receptors . DB01285 releasing factor ( CRF ) acts via Gq , and can modulate glutamater neurotransmission in the VTA . In the present study , we used brain slice electrophysiology to characterize the interaction of DA , glutamate antagonists , and CRF agonists in the induction and maintenance of P30518 in the VTA . Glutamate receptor antagonists blocked induction but not maintenance of P30518 . Putative blockers of neurotransmitter release and store-operated calcium channels blocked and reversed P30518 . CRF and the CRF agonist urocortin reversed inhibition produced by the D2 agonist quinpirole , consistent with our earlier work indicating that Gq activation reverses quinpirole-mediated inhibition . In whole cell recordings , the combination of urocortin and quinpirole , but not either agent alone , increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( sEPSCs ) in VTA neurons . Likewise , the combination of a D1-like receptor agonist and quinpirole , but not either agent alone , increased sEPSCs in VTA neurons . In summary , desensitization of D2 receptors induced by dopamine or CRF on DAergic VTA neurons is associated with increased glutamatergic signaling in the VTA .
