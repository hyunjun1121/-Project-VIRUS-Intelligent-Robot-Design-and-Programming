MicroRNA-155 modulates Treg and Th17 cells differentiation and Th17 cell function by targeting O15524 . MicroRNA ( miR ) -155 is a critical player in both innate and adaptive immune responses . It can influence P01730 (+) T cell lineage choice . To clarify the role of miR-155 in P01730 (+) CD25(+) regulatory T ( Treg ) /T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation and function , as well as the mechanism involved , we performed gain-and loss-of-function analysis by transfection pre-miR-155 and anti-miR-155 into purified P01730 (+) T cells . The results showed that miR-155 positively regulated both Treg and Th17 cell differentiation . It also induced the release of interleukin ( IL ) -17A by Th17 cells , but not the release of P22301 and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β1 by Treg cells . Furthermore , we found that miR-155 reacted through regulating Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK/ P35610 ) rather than TGF-β/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog ( SMAD ) signaling pathway in the process of Treg and Th17 cells differentiation . This may because suppressors of cytokine signaling ( Q9NSE2 )1 , the important negative regulator of JAK/ P35610 signaling pathway , was the direct target of miR-155 in this process , but Q15796 and Q99717 were not . Therefore , we demonstrated that miR-155 enhanced Treg and Th17 cells differentiation and Q16552 production by targeting O15524 .
