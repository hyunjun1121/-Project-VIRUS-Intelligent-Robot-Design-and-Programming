DB01599 inactivates O95477 in the plasma membrane with respect to its mediation of apolipoprotein binding and high density lipoprotein assembly and to its proteolytic degradation . DB01599 has been shown to inhibit the release of cellular lipid by helical apolipoprotein and thereby to reduce plasma high density lipoprotein . We attempted to explore the underlying mechanism for this effect in human fibroblast WI-38 . DB01599 inhibited the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid release and binding of apoA-I to the cells in a dose-dependent manner . It did not influence cellular uptake of low density lipoprotein , transport of cholesterol to the cell surface whether de novo synthesized or delivered as low density lipoprotein , and overall cellular content of cholesterol , although biosynthesis of lipids from acetate was somewhat increased . DB01599 did not affect the mRNA level of O95477 , and O95477 was recovered along with marker proteins for plasma membrane regardless of the presence of probucol . However , the protein level of O95477 increased , and the rate of its decay in the presence of cycloheximide was slower in the probucol-treated cells . O95477 in the probucol-treated cells was resistant to digestion by calpain but not by trypsin . We concluded that probucol inactivates O95477 in the plasma membrane with respect to its function in mediating binding of and lipid release by apolipoprotein and with respect to proteolytic degradation by calpain .
