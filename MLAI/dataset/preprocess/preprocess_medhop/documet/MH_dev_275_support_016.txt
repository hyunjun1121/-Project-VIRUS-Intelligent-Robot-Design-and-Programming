Human umbilical cord Wharton 's jelly stem cells : immune property genes assay and effect of transplantation on the immune cells of heart failure patients . Stem cells derived from umbilical cord Wharton 's jelly ( WJSCs ) are not immunogenic and have immunosuppressive effects . To evaluate the related mechanisms and the effect of transplantation on body immune cells , we examined immune property genes expression in WJSCs and levels of T-lymphocytes subgroups and immunoglobulins ( Ig ) in heart failure ( HF ) patients with and without WJSCs transplantation . WJSCs express immune tolerance genes P13747 , P17693 and P30511 and immunomodulation genes P15692 , TGFβ1 , P14210 , P09601 , IL1β , P05231 , P15018 , LGALS-1/3/8 , P23219 /2 and PTGE , while they do not express immune response-related genes HLA-DR , HLA-DQ , HLA-DP , P33681 , P42081 , P25942 and P29965 . No obvious changes of T-lymphocytes subgroups and plasma IgG/IgM were observed in HF patients with WJSCs transplantation . Our results suggest that the immune properties of WJSCs are due to the expression of immune avoidance and immunomodulation genes in the absence of immune response-related genes . WJSCs are secure in immunological aspects when used as seed cells for cardiac repair .
