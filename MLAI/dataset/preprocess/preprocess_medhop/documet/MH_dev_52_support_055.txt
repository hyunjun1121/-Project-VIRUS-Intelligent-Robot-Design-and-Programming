The role of protein kinase C activation in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications . Many vascular diseases in diabetes are known to be associated with the activation of the diacylglycerol ( DAG ) -protein kinase C ( PKC ) pathway . The major source of DAG that is elevated in diabetes is de novo synthesis from glycolytic intermediates . Among the various PKC isoforms , the beta-isoform has been shown to be persistently activated in diabetic animals . Multiple lines of evidence have shown that many vascular alterations in diabetes -- such as a decrease in the activity of Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase ( Na+-K+-ATPase ) , and increases in extracellular matrix , cytokines , permeability , contractility , and cell proliferation -- are caused by activation of PKC . Inhibition of PKC by two different kinds of PKC inhibitors , LY333531 , a selective P05771 -isoform inhibitor , and d- DB00163 , were able to prevent or reverse the various vascular dysfunctions in diabetic rats . These results have also provided in vivo evidence that DAG-PKC activation could be responsible for the hyperglycemia-induced vascular dysfunctions in diabetes . Clinical studies are now being performed to clarify the pathogenic roles of the DAG-PKC pathway in developing vascular complications in diabetic patients .
