Pro-fibrogenic potential of Q9GZP0 in liver fibrosis . BACKGROUND/AIMS : We analyzed the expression of platelet-derived growth factor D ( Q9GZP0 ) in an experimental bile duct-ligated ( BDL ) rat model and assessed its biological function in cultured hepatic stellate cells ( P19526 ) and myofibroblasts ( MFB ) . METHODS : The mRNA for PDGF-A , -B , -C , -D and for PDGF receptor-alpha and -beta chains ( PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta ) in normal and fibrotic rat livers was assessed quantitatively . Protein levels of Q9GZP0 were quantified by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The relative mRNA expression of all PDGF isoforms and receptors upregulated upon BDL and PDGF-A , -B and -D expression was significantly higher than that of Q9NRA1 . Q9GZP0 and PDGFRbeta protein also increased markedly . Immunostaining revealed that Q9GZP0 is localized along the fibrotic septa of the periportal- and perisinusoidal areas . Besides PDGF-B , Q9GZP0 is the second most potent PDGF isoform in PDGFRbeta signaling within P19526 /MFB , evidenced by PDGFRbeta autophosphorylation and activation of the downstream signaling molecules P27361 /2- , JNK- , p38 MAPK , and P31749 /Akt while Q9NRA1 effects were minimal . Q9GZP0 exerted mitogenic and fibrogenic effects in both cultured P19526 and MFB comparable to PDGF-B but PDGF-A and -C showed only marginal fibrogenic effects . CONCLUSIONS : Q9GZP0 possesses potential pathogenetic properties for P19526 activation and matrix remodeling in liver fibrosis .
