Differential effects of interleukin-2 and interleukin-15 versus interleukin-21 on P01730 + cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells . In this study , we compared the effects of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) , P40933 , and Q9HBE4 on gene expression , activation of cell signaling pathways , and functional properties of cells derived from P01730 + cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Whereas both P60568 and P40933 modulated , in a CTCL cell line , the expression of > 1,000 gene transcripts by at least 2-fold , Q9HBE4 up-regulated < 40 genes . All three cytokines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 in CTCL cell lines and native leukemic ( Sezary ) cells . However , only P60568 and P40933 strongly activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 , phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt , and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) kinase/ P29323 signaling pathways in the cell lines and mitogen-primed native cells . In contrast , Q9HBE4 selectively activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 . Whereas all three cytokines protected CTCL cells from apoptosis , only P60568 and P40933 promoted their proliferation . The effects of the cytokine stimulation were Jak3 kinase- and Jak1 kinase- dependent . These findings document the vastly different effect of P60568 and P40933 versus Q9HBE4 on CTCL cells . They also suggest two novel therapeutic approaches to CTCL and , possibly , other P01730 + T-cell lymphomas : inhibition of the Jak1/Jak3 kinase complex and , given the known strong immunostimulatory properties of Q9HBE4 on CD8+ T , natural killer , and B cells , application of this cytokine to boost an immune response against malignant P01730 + T cells .
