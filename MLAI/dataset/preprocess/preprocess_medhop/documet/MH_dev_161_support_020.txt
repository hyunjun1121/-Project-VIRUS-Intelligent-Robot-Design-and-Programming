Q9Y6J6 forms potassium channels with P22001 and P51787 in the choroid plexus epithelium . Cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) is crucial for normal function and mechanical protection of the CNS . The choroid plexus epithelium ( CPe ) is primarily responsible for secreting P04141 and regulating its composition by mechanisms currently not fully understood . Previously , the heteromeric P51787 - Q9Y6J6 K(+) channel was functionally linked to epithelial processes including gastric acid secretion and thyroid hormone biosynthesis . Here , using Kcne2(-/-) tissue as a negative control , we found cerebral expression of Q9Y6J6 to be markedly enriched in the CPe apical membrane , where we also discovered expression of P51787 . Targeted Kcne2 gene deletion in C57B6 mice increased CPe outward K(+) current 2-fold . The Kcne2 deletion-enhanced portion of the current was inhibited by XE991 ( 10 μM ) and margatoxin ( 10 μM ) but not by dendrotoxin ( 100 nM ) , indicating that it arose from augmentation of KCNQ subfamily and P22001 but not Q09470 K(+) channel activity . Kcne2 deletion in C57B6 mice also altered the polarity of CPe P51787 and P22001 trafficking , hyperpolarized the CPe membrane by 9 ± 2 mV , and increased P04141 [ Cl(-) ] by 14 % compared with wild-type mice . These findings constitute the first report of CPe dysfunction caused by cation channel gene disruption and suggest that Q9Y6J6 influences blood- P04141 anion flux by regulating P51787 and P22001 in the CPe .
