Steric-dependent label-free and washing-free enzyme amplified protein detection with dual-functional synthetic probes . Enzyme-catalyzed signal amplification with an antibody-enzyme conjugate is commonly employed in many bioanalytical methods to increase assay sensitivity . However , covalent labeling of the enzyme to the antibody , laborious operating procedures , and extensive washing steps are necessary for protein recognition and signal amplification . Herein , we describe a novel label-free and washing-free enzyme-amplified protein detection method by using dual-functional synthetic molecules to impose steric effects upon protein binding . In our approach , protein recognition and signal amplification are modulated by a simple dual-functional synthetic probe which consists of a protein ligand and an inhibitor . In the absence of the target protein , the inhibitor from the dual-functional probe would inhibit the enzyme activity . In contrast , binding of the target protein to the ligand perturbs this enzyme-inhibitor affinity due to the generation of steric effects caused by the close proximity between the target protein and the enzyme , thereby activating the enzyme to initiate signal amplification . With this strategy , the fluorescence signal can be amplified to as high as 70-fold . The generality and versatility of this strategy are demonstrated by the rapid , selective , and sensitive detection of four different proteins , avidin , O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( P16455 ) , P60880 -tag , and lactoferrin , with four different probes .
