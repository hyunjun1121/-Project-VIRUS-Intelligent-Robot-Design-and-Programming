A phase II study of afatinib ( DB08916 ) , an irreversible ErbB family blocker , in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer progressing after trastuzumab . DB08916 is an oral , ErbB family blocker , which covalently binds and irreversibly blocks all kinase-competent ErbB family members . This phase II , open-label , single-arm study explored afatinib activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive breast cancer patients progressing after trastuzumab treatment . Patients had stage IIIB/IV P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer , with progression following trastuzumab or trastuzumab intolerance and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 0-2 . Patients received 50 mg afatinib once-daily until disease progression . Primary endpoint was objective response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 ) , with tumor assessments every 8 weeks . Forty-one patients were treated . Patients had received a median of three prior chemotherapy lines ( range , 0-15 ) and 68.3 % had received trastuzumab for > 1 year . Four patients ( 10 % of 41 treated ; 11 % of evaluable patients ) had partial response . Fifteen patients ( 37 % of 41 ) had stable disease as best response and 19 ( 46 % of 41 ) achieved clinical benefit . Median progression-free survival was 15.1 weeks ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 8.1-16.7 ) ; median overall survival was 61.0 weeks ( 95 % CI : 56.7-not evaluable ) . Most frequent common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea ( 24.4 % ) and rash ( 9.8 % ) . DB08916 monotherapy was associated with promising clinical activity in extensively pretreated P04626 -positive breast cancer patients who had progressed following trastuzumab treatment .
