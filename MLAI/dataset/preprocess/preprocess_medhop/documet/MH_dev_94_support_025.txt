Role of redox signaling in the autonomous proliferative response of endothelial cells to hypoxia . Endothelial cells exhibit an autonomous proliferative response to hypoxia , independent of paracrine effectors . In cultured endothelial cells of porcine aorta , we analyzed the signaling of this response , with a focus on the roles of redox signaling and the MEK/ P29323 pathway . Transient hypoxia ( 1 hour ) stimulated proliferation by 61+/-4 % ( n=16 ; P < 0.05 versus control ) , quantified after 24 hours normoxic postincubation . Hypoxia induced an activation of P28482 and of NAD(P)H oxidase and a burst of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , determined by DCF fluorescence . To inhibit the MEK/ P29323 pathway , we used PD 98059 ( PD , 20 micromol/L ) ; to downregulate NAD(P)H oxidase , we applied P13498 antisense oligonucleotides ; and to inhibit mitochondrial ROS generation , we used the ubiquinone derivate mitoQ ( MQ , 10 micromol/L ) . All three inhibitions suppressed the proliferative response : PD inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activation ; P13498 antisense transfection did not inhibit P28482 activation , but suppressed ROS production ; and MQ inhibited P28482 activation and ROS production . The autonomous proliferative response depends on the MEK/ P29323 pathway and redox signaling steps upstream and downstream of P29323 . Located upstream is ROS generation by mitochondria , downstream is NAD(P)H oxidase .
