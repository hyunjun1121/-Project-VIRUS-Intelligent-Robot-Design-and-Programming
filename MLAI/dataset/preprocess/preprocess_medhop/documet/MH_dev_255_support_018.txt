Physical activity modifies the association between P13498 gene polymorphisms and small artery elasticity in a Chinese population . Emerging evidence suggests that increased superoxide production is responsible for a significant proportion of endothelial dysfunction . The relationship between variants of the P13498 gene and cardiovascular diseases is currently debated . In the present study , we investigated the influence of P13498 polymorphisms ( rs1049255 and rs7195830 ) on arterial elasticity in a Chinese population . In the 2178 participants enrolled in the GaoYou study , we measured large artery elasticity ( C1 ) and small artery elasticity ( P06681 ) non-invasively , genotyped the P13498 polymorphisms and calculated energy expenditure . The AA genotype of the rs1049255 polymorphism was associated with a lower P06681 than were the GG/AG genotypes ( 5.31±0.11 vs. 5.52±0.06 ml mm Hg(-1) × 100 ; P=0.01 ) . Further analyses revealed an interaction between P13498 polymorphisms and physical activity with respect to P06681 ( P=0.007 for rs1049255 and P=0.038 for rs7195830 ) . In less physically active participants , the AA genotype of the rs1049255 polymorphism was associated with a significantly lower P06681 than the GG/AG genotypes ( 4.69±0.16 vs. 5.26±0.19 ml mm Hg(-1) × 100 ; P=0.008 ) . In physically active participants , the GG/AG genotypes of rs7195830 polymorphism were correlated with higher P06681 values than the AA genotype ( 5.84±0.08 vs. 5.08±0.32 ml mm Hg(-1) × 100 ; P=0.049 ) . Haplotype analyses revealed higher P06681 values in rs1049255G-rs7195830G carriers ( P=0.0015 ) . In conclusion , the rs1049255 and rs7195830 polymorphisms of the P13498 gene were associated with P06681 in a Chinese population ; physical activity could modify this genetic effect .
