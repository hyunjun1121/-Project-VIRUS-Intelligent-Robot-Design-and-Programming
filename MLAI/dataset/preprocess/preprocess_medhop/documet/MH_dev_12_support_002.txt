P01236 influence on cytosol and nuclear androgen receptors in the ventral , dorsal , and lateral lobes of the rat prostate . PRL augments testosterone-mediated growth of the prostate in a permissive manner . To elucidate the mechanism of this hormonal interaction , the present study examined the effect of PRL on cytosol and nuclear androgen receptors in the three prostate lobes . Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated , given 5-mm Silastic implants of testosterone , and either grafted with two anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule or sham operated . Three weeks later , animals were killed , serum was collected for PRL and testosterone RIA , and the ventral , dorsal , and lateral prostate lobes were processed for either cytosol or nuclear androgen receptor quantitation . Pituitary grafts significantly elevated the serum PRL concentration and increased the weight and the content of protein and DNA of the lateral prostate lobe compared to control values . There was no effect on these parameters in the ventral or dorsal lobes . P10275 levels and apparent distributions were different in the ventral , dorsal , and lateral lobes of control animals . Unoccupied and total cytosolic androgen receptors in the three separate prostate lobes were not significantly affected by the presence of the grafts . However , an elevated PRL concentration was associated with an increase ( P less than 0.005 ) in nuclear androgen receptor content in the lateral lobe exclusively . The binding affinity was not altered by pituitary grafts in any of the lobes . These findings suggest that PRL promotes lateral prostatic growth by increasing nuclear androgen receptor levels in that tissue and , thus , optimizes its response to circulating testosterone .
