DB00051 as second line anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy for Crohn 's disease : A single centre experience . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Non-response , loss of response , or intolerance to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha ( anti- P01375 α ) therapy is well recognised in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patients . Data concerning outcomes following the use of a second anti- P01375 α therapy , particularly in patients who do not respond to a first anti- P01375 α agent , are still emerging . The aim of this study was to assess response and tolerability to adalimumab following infliximab failure in a single centre cohort of CD patients . METHODS : Data were collected prospectively on 44 patients who received adalimumab therapy following infliximab failure . Initial response to adalimumab therapy at 6weeks following induction was defined using a two point decrease in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index , with remission at this point defined using a Harvey Bradshaw index≤4 . Sustained clinical benefit at the last point of follow up was determined using a physician 's global assessment . Corticosteroid-free sustained clinical benefit was also assessed at this point . RESULTS : Thirty-four ( 77 % ) patients had initial response to adalimumab therapy , with 28 ( 64 % ) having sustained clinical benefit . Corticosteroid-free sustained clinical benefit was achieved in nine ( 53 % ) of 17 patients requiring steroids at commencement of adalimumab . Four ( 44 % ) of the 9 patients who were primary non-responders to infliximab responded to adalimumab . The majority of CD patients who failed adalimumab therapy required surgery . CONCLUSIONS : Second-line anti- P01375 α therapy with adalimumab is effective at both inducing remission and maintaining response in CD patients who have failed infliximab , regardless of the reason for infliximab failure .
