[ Effect of the genetic markers Kell( P04264 ) , P1 , Km(1) , Tf ( C < B < D ) , AK and 6- P52209 on the outcome of paternity cases ] . This statistical analysis of the results of 288 paternity cases is a contribution to the discussion of those blood group systems to be selected for the basis of paternity expertise in the Federal Republic of Germany . When typing 22 blood-group systems in 288 one-man cases , we found exclusions in 101 ( 35.07 % ) of them . In only 83 ( 44.39 % ) of the 187 cases with nonexclusions did the resulting EM value correspond to the verbal predicate : " paternity practically proved. " The results of the systems of factors Kell( P04264 ) , Tf(C,B,D) , AK and 6- P52209 had the smallest rate of exclusion constellations and only inferior influence on the resulting EM values . Replacing them by isoelectric focusing of the systems P36871 , Tf , Gc , Pi and P00747 ( plasminogen ) seems to be reasonable . The factors P1 and Km(1) proved more favorable for the results of paternity cases .
