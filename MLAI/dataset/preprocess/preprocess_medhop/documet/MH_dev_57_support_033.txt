P51587 interacts with the cytoskeletal linker protein plectin to form a complex controlling centrosome localization . The breast cancer susceptibility gene ( P51587 ) is localized mainly in the nucleus where it plays an important role in DNA damage repair . Some P51587 protein is also present in the centrosome . Here , we demonstrate that P51587 interacts with plectin , a cytoskeletal cross-linker protein , and that this interaction controls the position of the centrosome . Phosphorylation of plectin by cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B ( P06493 /CycB ) kinase has been reported to abolish its cross-linking function during mitosis . Here , we induced phosphorylation of plectin in prepared fractions of HeLa cells by adding activated P06493 /CycB kinase . Consequently , there was significant dissociation of the centrosome from the nuclear membrane . Q15149 has six homologous ankyrin-like repeat domains ( termed Q15149 M1-M6 ) . Using a pull-down assay , we found that Q86UG4 - Q15149 M1 and a Q86UG4 -C-terminal region fusion protein ( which comprised Q15149 M6 , along with an adjacent vimentin site ) interacted with P51587 . Since each Q15149 module exhibits high homology to the others , the possibility of all six domains participating in this interaction was indicated . Moreover , when Q15149 M1 was overexpressed in HeLa cells , it competed with endogenous plectin and inhibited the P51587 -plectin interaction . This inhibitory effect resulted in dissociation of the centrosomes from the nucleus and increased the rate of micronuclei formation which may lead to carcinogenesis . In addition , when either P51587 or plectin was suppressed by the appropriate siRNA , a similar change in centrosomal positioning was observed . We suggest that the P51587 -plectin interaction plays an important role in the regulation of centrosome localization and also that displacement of the centrosome may result in genomic instability and cancer development .
