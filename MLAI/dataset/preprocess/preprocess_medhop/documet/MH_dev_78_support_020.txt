Persistent production of platelet thromboxane A2 in patients chronically treated with aspirin . BACKGROUND : Patients treated with aspirin may have a reduced sensitivity to its antiplatelet effect . The mechanism accounting for such a reduced sensitivity might involve an impaired interaction of aspirin with cyclooxygenase-1 ( P36551 ) -1 . OBJECTIVE : We sought to investigate whether platelets from patients under chronic treatment with aspirin still produce TxA2 and whether there is any relationship between the eventual persistent TxA2 formation and platelet aggregation . Finally , whether platelet-derived TxA2 can be inhibited by in vitro addition of aspirin . METHODS : Collagen-induced platelet aggregation and thromboxane-A2 ( TxA2 ) were measured in 196 patients treated with aspirin ( 100-330 mg day(-1) ) because of previous vascular events or presence of risk factors of atherosclerosis . RESULTS : Collagen-induced TxA2 production of the entire cohort was 128.7 +/- 21.6 pg 10(-8) cells , and was significantly correlated with platelet aggregation ( Spearman 's correlation coefficient = 0.44 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Patients in the highest quartile of TxA2 showed higher platelet response to collagen ( P < 0.0001 ) when compared with those in the lowest quartile . In a subgroup of 96 patients , platelets were treated in vitro with a TxA2 receptor antagonist ( 13-azaprostanoic acid ) or aspirin before stimulation with collagen . 13-APA acid significantly inhibited platelet aggregation . DB00945 reduced ( -72.9 % ) TxA2 production in patients with TxA2 values above the median but it was ineffective in those with TxA2 values below the median . CONCLUSION : In some patients chronically treated with aspirin platelet production of TxA2 may persist and account for enhanced platelet aggregation . Incomplete inhibition of P23219 seems to be implicated in persistent TxA2 production .
