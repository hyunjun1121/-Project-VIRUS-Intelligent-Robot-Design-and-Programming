P24530 deficiency predisposes to pulmonary edema formation via increased lung vascular endothelial cell growth factor expression . Endothelin ( ET ) may contribute to pulmonary edema formation , particularly under hypoxic conditions , and decreases in P24530 receptor expression can lead to reduced ET clearance . ET increases vascular endothelial cell growth factor ( P15692 ) production in vitro , and P15692 overexpression in the lung causes pulmonary edema in vivo . We hypothesized that pulmonary vascular P24530 receptor deficiency leads to increased lung ET , that excess ET increases lung P15692 levels , promoting pulmonary edema formation , and that hypoxia exaggerates these effects . We studied these hypotheses in P24530 receptor-deficient rats . In normoxia , homozygous P24530 -deficient animals had significantly more lung vascular leak than heterozygous or control animals . Hypoxia increased vascular leak regardless of genotype , and hypoxic P24530 -deficient animals leaked more than hypoxic control animals . P24530 -deficient animals had higher lung ET levels in both normoxia and hypoxia . Lung HIF-1alpha and P15692 content was greater in the P24530 -deficient animals in both normoxia and hypoxia , and both HIF-1alpha and P15692 levels were reduced by P25101 receptor antagonism . Both P25101 receptor blockade and P15692 antagonism reduced vascular leak in hypoxic P24530 -deficient animals . We conclude that P24530 receptor-deficient animals display an exaggerated lung vascular protein leak in normoxia , that hypoxia exacerbates that leak , and that this effect is in part attributable to an ET-mediated increase in lung P15692 content .
