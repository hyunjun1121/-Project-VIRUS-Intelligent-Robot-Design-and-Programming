Effects of diethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) given neonatally on spermatogenesis of mice . We previously demonstrated that the effects of diethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) alter reproduction function on male mice . Immature male mice were treated daily with DEHP from postnatal day 7-21 , 7-35 , 7-49 , in a dose-dependent manner . As results , both the quality and quantity of spermatozoa were decreased in 60-day-old mice . The results by RT-PCR analysis indicated that DDx3Y , Usp9Y , RBM , E1F1AY , P01133 , P23945 and P00533 genes were down-regulated , and LHR , Cyp17a1 and Cyp19a1 were down-regulated in response to DEHP . These genes were selected based on their markedly increased or decreased expression levels . However , DEHP had no effect on the meiotic process and recombination levels in male mouse germ cells . Treatment with DEHP induced histopathological changes in the testes . Taken together , these results provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental impacts of DEHP in humans and wildlife .
