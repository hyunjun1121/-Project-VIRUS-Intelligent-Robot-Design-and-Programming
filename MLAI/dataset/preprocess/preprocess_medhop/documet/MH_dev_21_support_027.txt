Examining the genetic and neural components of cognitive flexibility using mice . This commentary summarizes the research presented during the symposium " Examining the genetic and neural components of cognitive flexibility using mice " at the annual meeting of the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society 2011 . Research presented includes examining : 1 ) Corticostriatal networks underlying reversal learning using Q13224 knockout mice , cFos expression , and in vivo electrophysiological recording ; 2 ) Cerebellar contribution to reversal learning using mutants with Purkinje cell loss and in vivo electrochemical recording ; 3 ) Parvalbumin contribution to reversal learning and set-shifting using Q03405 mutants and in vitro recording to examine fast-spiking interneurones ; and 4 ) Alpha 7 nAChR contribution to reversal learning , set-shifting , motivation , and the ' eureka moment ' of rule acquisition . It is proposed that these studies revealed more about the neurobiology underlying these behaviors than could be discovered using pharmacological techniques alone . Together , the research presented stressed the importance of exploring the genetic contribution to neuropsychiatric disease and the important role that the mouse , coupled with robust behavioral measures , can play in understanding neurobiology underlying cognitive flexibility .
