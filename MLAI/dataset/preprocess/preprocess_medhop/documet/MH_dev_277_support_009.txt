Expression of type I P01148 receptor and in vivo and in vitro P01148 -I effects in corpora lutea of pseudopregnant rabbits . The expression of type I P01148 receptor ( P30968 -I ) and the direct role of P01148 -I on corpora lutea ( CL ) function were studied in the pseudopregnant rabbit model . Immunohistochemistry evidenced P30968 -I and P01148 -I in luteal cells at early ( day 4 pseudopregnancy ) - , mid ( day 9 ) - , and late ( day 13 ) -luteal stages . Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting revealed P30968 -I mRNA and protein at the three luteal stages . DB06719 in vivo treatment at days 9 and 13 decreased plasma progesterone levels for 48 and 24 h respectively . In in vitro cultured CL , buserelin reduced progesterone secretion , increased prostaglandin F(2α) ( P49763 (2α) ) secretion and cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) activities at days 9 and 13 , and decreased PGE₂ at day 13 . Co-incubation with antagonists for P01148 -I ( antide ) , inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( IP₃ , 2-amino-ethoxydiphenylborate ) , and diacylglycerol ( DAG , 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl glycerol ) or inhibitors for phospholipase C ( P98160 , compound 48/80 ) , and protein kinase C ( PKC , staurosporine ) counteracted the buserelin effects . DB06719 co-incubated with P36551 inhibitor ( acetylsalicylic acid ) increased progesterone and decreased P49763 (2α) and NOS activity at days 9 and 13 , whereas co-incubation with NOS inhibitor ( DB04223 methyl ester ) increased progesterone at the same luteal stages . These results suggest that P30968 -I is constitutively expressed in rabbit CL independently of luteal stage , whereas P01148 -I down-regulates directly CL progesterone production via P49763 (2α) at mid- and late-luteal stages of pseudopregnancy , utilizing its cognate type I receptor with a post-receptorial mechanism that involves P98160 , IP₃ , DAG , PKC , P35354 , and NOS .
