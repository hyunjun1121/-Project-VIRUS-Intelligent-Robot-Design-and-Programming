High LET (56)Fe ion irradiation induces tissue-specific changes in DNA methylation in the mouse . DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that drives phenotype and that can be altered by environmental exposures including radiation . The majority of human radiation exposures occur in a relatively low dose range ; however , the biological response to low dose radiation is poorly understood . Based on previous observations , we hypothesized that in vivo changes in DNA methylation would be observed in mice following exposure to doses of high linear energy transfer ( LET ) ( 56 ) Fe ion radiation between 10 and 100 cGy . We evaluated the DNA methylation status of genes for which expression can be regulated by methylation and that play significant roles in radiation responses or carcinogenic processes including apoptosis , metastasis , cell cycle regulation , and DNA repair ( P53355 , Q9UI08 , 14.3.3 , p16 , P16455 , and P17936 ) . We also evaluated DNA methylation of repeat elements in the genome that are typically highly methylated . No changes in liver DNA methylation were observed . Although no change in DNA methylation was observed for the repeat elements in the lungs of these same mice , significant changes were observed for the genes of interest as a direct effect and a delayed effect of irradiation 1 , 7 , 30 , and 120 days post exposure . At delayed times , differences in methylation profiles among genes were observed . DNA methylation profiles also significantly differed based on dose , with the lowest dose frequently affecting the largest change . The results of this study are the first to demonstrate in vivo high LET radiation-induced changes in DNA methylation that are tissue and locus specific , and dose and time dependent .
