Embryonic stem cell-derived neurons are a novel , highly sensitive tissue culture platform for botulinum research . There are no pharmacological treatments to rescue botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) -mediated paralysis of neuromuscular signaling . In part , this failure can be attributed to the lack of a cell culture model system that is neuron-based , allowing detailed elucidation of the mechanisms underlying BoNT pathogenesis , yet still compatible with modern cellular and molecular approaches . We have developed a method to derive highly enriched , glutamatergic neurons from suspension-cultured murine embryonic stem ( ES ) cells . Hypothesizing that ES cell-derived neurons ( ESNs ) might comprise a novel platform to investigate the neurotoxicology of BoNTs , we evaluated the susceptibility of ESNs to DB00083 and BoNT/E using molecular and functional assays . ESNs express neuron-specific proteins , develop synapses and release glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner under depolarizing conditions . They express the BoNT substrate SNARE proteins P60880 , P63027 and syntaxin , and treatment with DB00083 and BoNT/E holotoxin results in proteolysis of P60880 within 24 h with EC50s of 0.81 and 68.6 pM , respectively . Intoxication with DB00083 results in the functional inhibition of potassium-induced , calcium-dependent glutamate release . ESNs remain viable and susceptible to intoxication for up to 90 days after plating , enabling longitudinal screens exploring toxin-specific mechanisms underlying persistence of synaptic blockade . The evidence suggests that derived neurons are a novel , biologically relevant model system that combines the verisimilitude of primary neurons with the genetic tractability and scalable expansion of a continuous cell line , and thus should significantly accelerate BoNT research and drug discovery while dramatically decreasing animal use .
