P01236 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and corticotropin releasing hormone transcription in rat hypothalamic neurons . P01236 ( PRL ) modulates maternal behavior and mediates hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis inhibition during lactation via PRL receptors in the brain . To identify mechanisms mediating these effects , we examined the effects of PRL on signaling and P06850 transcription in hypothalamic neurons in vivo and in vitro . Western blot of hypothalamic proteins from rats receiving intracerebroventricular PRL injection revealed increases in phosphorylation of the MAPK and P29323 . Double-staining immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated P29323 localization in parvocellular P06850 neurons as well as magnocellular vasopressin and oxytocin neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular ( PVN ) and supraoptic nuclei . PRL also induced P29323 phosphorylation in vitro in the hypothalamic cell line , 4B , which expresses PRL receptors , and in primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures . Using reporter gene assays in 4B cells , or quantitative RT-PCR for primary transcript in hypothalamic cell cultures , PRL potentiated forskolin-stimulated P06850 transcription through activation of the P29323 /MAPK pathway . The effect of PRL in hypothalamic cell cultures was unaffected by tetrodotoxin , suggesting a direct effect on P06850 neurons . The data show that PRL activates the P29323 /MAPK pathway and facilitates P06850 transcription in P06850 neurons , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of PRL on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity reported in vivo is indirect and probably mediated through modulation of afferent pathways to the PVN . In addition , the prominent stimulatory action of PRL on the P29323 /MAPK pathway in the hypothalamic PVN and supraoptic nucleus is likely to mediate neuroplasticity of the neuroendocrine system during lactation .
