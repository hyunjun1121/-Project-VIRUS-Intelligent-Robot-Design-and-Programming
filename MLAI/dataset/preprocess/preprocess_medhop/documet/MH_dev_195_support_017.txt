Development and validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay quantifying olaparib in human plasma . DB09074 is an inhibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 ( P09874 ) . Phase I and II trials showed promising results of olaparib against tumours in BRCA mutation carriers . Currently an increasing number of clinical trials with olaparib in combination with other compounds or radiotherapy are conducted . To support these clinical trials an LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantification of olaparib in human plasma . Human plasma samples were collected in the clinic and stored at nominally -20°C . DB09074 was isolated from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction , separated on a C18 column with gradient elution and analyzed with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in positive ion mode . A deuterated isotope was used as internal standard for the quantification . The assay , ranging from 10 to 5000ng/mL , was linear with correlation coefficients ( r(2) ) of 0.9994 or better . The assay was accurate and precise , with inter-assay and intra-assay accuracies within ±7.6 % of nominal and inter-assay and intra-assay precision ≤9.3 % at the lower limit of quantification and ≤5.7 % at the other concentration levels tested . All results were within the acceptance criteria of the US FDA and the latest P15941 guidelines for method validation . A quantitative method was developed and validated for the quantification of olaparib in human plasma . The method could successfully be applied for the pharmacokinetic quantification of olaparib in cancer patients treated with olaparib .
