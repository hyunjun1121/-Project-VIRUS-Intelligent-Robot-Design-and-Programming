P15090 , a candidate progression marker of human transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder , is differentially regulated by Q07869 in urothelial cancer cells . Superficial pT1 bladder tumors are characterized by a high risk of recurrence and progression in grade and stage . Few studies provided evidence that loss of adipocyte-fatty acid binding protein ( P15090 ) expression was associated with bladder cancer progression . P15090 is a lipid binding protein playing a role in intracellular lipid transport and metabolism , as well as in signal transduction . We reported from bladder tumors that decrease of P15090 transcript level significantly correlated to tumor stage and to histologic grade ( p < 0.05 ) . Namely , in poor prognosis high grade pT1 tumors there was a loss of P15090 expression compared to good prognosis tumors suggesting that re-expression of P15090 could be a therapeutic approach in early stage bladder cancer to prevent disease progression . We demonstrated for the first time that this marker is upregulated by Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( Q07869 ) alpha , beta and gamma in T24 cells ( derived from an undifferentiated grade III carcinoma ) and only by PPARbeta in RT4 cells ( derived from a well differentiated grade I papillary tumor ) . This effect occurred through a Q07869 -dependent transcriptional mechanism without modifying mRNA stability and interestingly required de novo protein synthesis . Data as a whole suggest a prognostic significance of P15090 in bladder cancer outcome and the potential utility of overexpression of this protein by Q07869 agonists open up new perspectives in the treatment of bladder cancer .
