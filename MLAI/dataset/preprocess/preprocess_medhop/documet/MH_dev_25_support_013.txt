DB06643 -- an emerging treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease that is associated with an imbalance in bone remodeling . DB06643 is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the P01375 family that is the principal mediator of osteoclastic bone resorption . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis is evaluated by reviewing the published literature and presentations at scientific meetings through 2009 . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : This review focuses on the data on fracture risk reduction and safety endpoints of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis , denosumab ( 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months ) increased bone mineral density , reduced bone turnover markers , and reduced the risk of vertebral , hip and non-vertebral fractures . DB06643 was well tolerated with a safety profile generally similar to placebo . It is a promising emerging drug for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis .
