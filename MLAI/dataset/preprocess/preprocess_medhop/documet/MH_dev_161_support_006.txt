Novel marine phenazines as potential cancer chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory agents . Two new ( 1 and 2 ) and one known phenazine derivative ( lavanducyanin , 3 ) were isolated and identified from the fermentation broth of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp . ( strain CNS284 ) . In mammalian cell culture studies , compounds 1 , 2 and 3 inhibited P01375 -α-induced NFκB activity ( IC₅₀ values of 4.1 , 24.2 , and 16.3 μM , respectively ) and LPS-induced nitric oxide production ( IC₅₀ values of > 48.6 , 15.1 , and 8.0 μM , respectively ) . PGE₂ production was blocked with greater efficacy ( IC₅₀ values of 7.5 , 0.89 , and 0.63 μM , respectively ) , possibly due to inhibition of cyclooxygenases in addition to the expression of P35354 . Treatment of cultured HL-60 cells led to dose-dependent accumulation in the subG1 compartment of the cell cycle , as a result of apoptosis . These data provide greater insight on the biological potential of phenazine derivatives , and some guidance on how various substituents may alter potential anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects .
