Regulation of P33681 .1 costimulatory molecule is mediated by the IFN regulatory factor-7 through the activation of JNK in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells . The engagement of P10747 or P16410 with P33681 .1 provides the essential second costimulatory signal that regulates the development of immune responses , including T cell activation , differentiation , and induction of peripheral tolerance . The signaling molecules and the transcription factors involved in P33681 .1 regulation are poorly understood . In this study we investigated the role of MAPKs in the regulation of LPS-induced P33681 .1 expression in human monocytes and the promonocytic THP-1 cells . Our results show that LPS-induced P33681 .1 expression in monocytic cells did not involve the activation of either p38 or ERKs . Using the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 , small interfering RNAs specific for P45983 and P45984 , and agents such as dexamethasone that inhibit JNK activation , we determined that LPS-induced P33681 .1 expression was regulated by JNK MAPK in both monocytes and THP-1 cells . In addition , we identified a distinct P33681 .1-responsive element corresponding to the IFN regulatory factor-7 ( Q92985 ) binding site in the P33681 .1 promoter responsible for the regulation of LPS-induced P33681 .1 transcription . Furthermore , SP600125 and dexamethasone inhibited LPS-induced Q92985 activity . Taken together , these results suggest that LPS-induced P33681 .1 transcription in human monocytic cells may be regulated by JNK-mediated activation of the Q92985 transcription factor .
