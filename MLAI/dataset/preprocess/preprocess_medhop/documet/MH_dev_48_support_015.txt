Splice variants : a homology modeling approach . Splice variants play an important role within the cell in both increasing the proteome diversity and in cellular function . Splice variants are also associated with disease states and may play a role in their etiology . Information about splice variants has , until now , mostly been derived from the primary transcript or through cellular studies . In this study information from the transcript and other studies is combined with tertiary structure information derived from homology models . Through this method we have determined that it is possible to effectively model splice variants . Forty models of splice variants for fourteen proteins were produced . Analysis of the models shows that deletions produce superior model validation values . Additions to sequences where there is little homology become increasingly difficult to model with increasing sequence length . Many of the splicing events are associated with post-translational modification either in the N-terminal region by changing the signal peptide or by affecting the number or availability of glycosylation sites . Often the alternative exon combinations are associated with loss or gain of whole structural units , as opposed to just changing small loop regions . Losing part of the secondary structure may destabilize neighboring parts of the same secondary structure . Detailed analysis is given of four biomedically relevant proteins ( Beta-site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving enzyme ( P56817 ) , P05112 , Frataxin and Q30201 ) and their associated splice variant models . The visualization of these possible structures provides new insights about their functionality and the possible etiology of associated diseases .
