Therapeutic factor VIII does not trigger Q15399 .2 and O60603 .6 signalling in vitro . The administration of therapeutic factor VIII ( FVIII ) to patients with haemophilia A induces the development of inhibitory anti-FVIII IgG in a substantial number of patients . For an antigen-specific immune response to develop , antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) need to mature and procure appropriate co-stimulatory signals to T cells at the time of presentation of the endocytosed antigen . The nature of the danger signals that induce P25054 maturation , thus initiating the anti-FVIII immune response , are yet ill-characterized . Contradictory reports on a direct effect of therapeutic FVIII on P25054 maturation have been released . Here , we investigated whether FVIII directly triggers O60603 ( O60603 ) signalling . The capacity of human recombinant FVIII to promote the maturation of a mouse bone marrow macrophage cell line ( BMA ) was investigated by flow cytometry . In parallel , the triggering of Q15399 .2 or O60603 .6-expressing HEK293 cells by FVIII was analysed following transfection of the cells with a reporter construct for NFκB activity . In contrast , to zymosan , a known O60603 agonist , human recombinant FVIII did not induce the maturation of mouse BMA macrophages , as analysed by the levels of expression of P33681 , P42081 , P25942 and I-Ab at the cell surface . Furthermore , incubation of FVIII with cells expressing O60603 paired with Q15399 or Q9Y2C9 , failed to activate NFκB , whereas NKκB activity was triggered in the presence of zymosan . Our results confirm that FVIII alone is insufficient to trigger the maturation of APCs that is required to initiate an immune response .
