Systemic delivery and pre-clinical evaluation of nanoparticles containing antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs . By virtue of their potential to selectively silence oncogenic molecules in cancer cells , antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) and small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) are powerful tools for development of tailored anti-cancer drugs . The clinical benefit of ASO/siRNA therapeutic is , however , hampered due to poor pharmacokinetics and biodistribution , and suboptimal suppression of the target in tumor tissues . P04049 protein serine/threonine kinase is a druggable signaling molecule in cancer therapy . Our laboratory has developed cationic liposomes for systemic delivery of raf ASO ( DB04973 ) and raf siRNA ( LErafsiRNA ) to human tumor xenografts grown in athymic mice . DB04973 is also the first ASO containing liposomal drug tested in humans . In this article , we primarily focus on a modified formulation of systemically delivered cationic liposomes containing raf antisense oligonucleotide ( md- DB04973 ) . The cationic liposomes were prepared using dimyristoyl 1,2-diacyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane ( DMTAP ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , and cholesterol ( CHOL ) . The toxicology , pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , target selectivity , and anti-tumor efficacy studies of md- DB04973 were conducted in mice . We demonstrate that md- DB04973 is the next generation of systemically delivered and well-tolerated antisense therapeutic suitable for clinical evaluation .
