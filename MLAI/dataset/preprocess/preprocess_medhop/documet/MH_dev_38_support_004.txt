P17931 -independent Down-regulation of Q9UBS5 due to Treatment with Korean Herbal Extract HAD-B Reduces Proliferation of Human Colon Cancer Cells . OBJECTIVES : Many efforts have shown multi-oncologic roles of galectin-3 for cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and apoptosis . However , the mechanisms by which galectin-3 is involved in cell proliferation are not yet fully understood , especially in human colon cancer cells . METHODS : To cluster genes showing positively or negatively correlated expression with galectin-3 , we employed human colon cancer cell lines , SNU-61 , SNU-81 , SNU-769B , SNU-C4 and SNU- P01031 in high-throughput gene expression profiling . Gene and protein expression levels were determined by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and western blot analysis , respectively . The proliferation rate of human colon cancer cells was measured by using a 3- ( 4 , 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . RESULTS : Expression of γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor 1 ( Q9UBS5 ) showed a positive correlation with galectin-3 at both the transcriptional and the translational levels . Downregulation of galectin-3 decreased not only Q9UBS5 expression but also the proliferation rate of human colon cancer cells . However , Korean herbal extract , HangAmDan-B ( HAD-B ) , decreased expression of Q9UBS5 without any expressional change of galectin-3 , and offset γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -enhanced human colon cancer cell proliferation . CONCLUSIONS : Our present study confirmed that Q9UBS5 expression was regulated by galectin-3 . HAD-B induced galectin-3-independent down-regulation of Q9UBS5 , which resulted in a decreased proliferation of human colon cancer cells . The therapeutic effect of HAD-B for the treatment of human colon cancer needs to be further validated .
