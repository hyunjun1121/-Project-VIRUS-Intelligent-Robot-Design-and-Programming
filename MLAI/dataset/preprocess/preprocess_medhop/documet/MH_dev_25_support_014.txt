Mechanisms of ganglioside inhibition of P25054 function . Gangliosides shed by tumor cells exert potent inhibitory effects on cellular immune responses . Here we have studied ganglioside inhibition of P25054 function . When human monocytes were preincubated in 50 micro M highly purified ganglioside G(D1a) , pulsed with tetanus toxoid ( TT ) , and washed , the expected Ag-induced proliferative response of autologous normal T cells added to these monocytes was inhibited by 81 % . Strikingly , there was also almost complete ( 92 % ) and selective inhibition of the up-regulation of the monocyte costimulatory molecule P33681 , while I- P62158 -1 , LFA-3 , HLA-DR , and P42081 expression were unaffected . Purified LPS-stimulated monocytes that had been preincubated in G(D1a) likewise showed inhibition of P33681 up-regulation ( 59 % ) as well as down-regulation of P25942 ( 54 % ) and impaired release of IL-12 and P01375 ( reduced by 59 and 51 % ) . G(D1a)-preincubated human dendritic cells ( DC ) were also affected . They had reduced constitutive expression of P25942 ( 33 % ) and P33681 ( 61 % ) , but not P42081 , and marked inhibition of release of P05231 ( 72 % ) , IL-12 ( 70 % ) , and P01375 ( 46 % ) . Even when pulsed with TT , these ganglioside-preincubated DC remained deficient in costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion and were unable to induce a normal T cell proliferative response to TT . Finally , significant inhibition of nuclear localization of NF-kappaB proteins in activated DC suggests that disruption of NF-kappaB activation may be one mechanism contributing to ganglioside interference with P25054 expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokine secretion , which , in turn , may diminish antitumor immune responses .
