P62937 interacts with domain II of hepatitis C virus NS5A and stimulates RNA binding in an isomerase-dependent manner . NS5A plays a critical , yet poorly defined , role in hepatitis C virus genome replication . The protein consists of three domains , each of which is able to bind independently to the 3' untranslated region ( UTR ) of the viral positive strand genomic RNA . The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A ( CypA ) binds to domain II , catalyzing cis-trans isomerization . CypA inhibitors such as cyclosporine ( DB00091 ) have been shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) replication . We show here that CypA stimulated domain II RNA binding activity , and this stimulation was abrogated by DB00091 . An isomerase mutant of CypA ( H126Q ) failed to bind to domain II and did not stimulate RNA binding . Finally , we demonstrate that the RNA binding of two domain II mutants , the D316E and D316E/Y317N mutants , previously shown to exhibit CypA independence for RNA replication , was unaffected by CypA . This study provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of CypA activity during HCV replication and further validates the use of CypA inhibitors in HCV therapy .
