VIPhyb , an antagonist of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor , enhances cellular antiviral immunity in murine cytomegalovirus infected mice . Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) is a neuropeptide hormone that suppresses Th1-mediated cellular immunity . We previously reported that P01282 -knockout ( P01282 -KO ) mice have enhanced cellular immune responses and increased survival following murine cytomegalovirus ( mCMV ) infection in C57BL/6 mice . In this study , we tested whether treatment with a P01282 receptor antagonistic peptide protects C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice from mCMV-infection . One week of daily subcutaneous injections of VIPhyb was non-toxic and did not alter frequencies of immune cell subsets in non-infected mice . VIPhyb administration to mCMV-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice markedly enhanced survival , viral clearance , and reduced liver and lung pathology compared with saline-treated controls . The numbers of effector/memory CD8+ T-cells and mature NK cells were increased in VIPhyb-treated mice compared with PBS-treated groups . Pharmacological blockade of P01282 -receptor binding or genetic blockade of P01282 -signaling prevented the up-regulation of Q9NZQ7 and P18621 expression on DC and activated CD8+ T-cells , respectively , in mCMV-infected mice , and enhanced P33681 , P42081 , and MHC-II expression on conventional and plasmacytoid DC . VIPhyb-treatment increased type-I IFN synthesis , numbers of IFN-γ- and P01375 -α-expressing NK cells and T-cells , and the numbers of mCMV-M45 epitope-peptide-MHC-I tetramer CD8+ T-cells following mCMV infection . P01282 -treatment lowered the percentage of Treg cells in spleens compared with PBS-treated WT mice following mCMV infection , while significantly decreasing levels of serum P15692 induced by mCMV-infection . The mice in all treated groups exhibited similar levels of anti-mCMV antibody titers . Short-term administration of a P01282 -receptor antagonist represents a novel approach to enhance innate and adaptive cellular immunity in a murine model of CMV infection .
