Gender-specific effects of endogenous testosterone : female alpha-estrogen receptor-deficient C57Bl/6J mice develop glomerulosclerosis . Young female mice on a C57Bl/6J ( B6 ) background are considered glomerulosclerosis ( GS ) -resistant but aging B6 mice develop mild GS . Estrogen deficiency accelerates while estrogen replacement retards GS in young sclerosis-prone oligosyndactyly mutant mice on an P04000 background . To explore the effects of sex hormones on glomerular structure and function in the context of gender and genetic background , we studied mice in which the estrogen-receptor ( ER ) genes alpha- or -beta were deleted ( alpha- or betaER knockout ( KO ) ) and crossed into the B6 background . We also studied ovariectomized ( Ovx ) B6 mice given testosterone . Male and female betaERKO and male alphaERKO mice had no glomerular dysfunction at 9 months of age ; however , alphaERKO female mice displayed albuminuria and GS . Ovx prevented glomerular dysfunction in alphaERKO female mice by eliminating endogenous testosterone production while exogenous testosterone induced GS in Ovx B6 mice . P10275 ( AR ) expression and function was found in microdissected glomeruli and cultured mesangial cells . DB00624 compared to placebo increased both AR expression and TGF-beta1 mRNA levels in glomeruli isolated from female B6 mice . Estrogen deficiency had no deleterious effects on the glomeruli in B6 mice . Our study shows that genetic traits strongly influence the GS-promoting effects of estrogen deficiency while testosterone induces GS in a gender-specific manner .
