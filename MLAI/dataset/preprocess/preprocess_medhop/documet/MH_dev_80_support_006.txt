Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy . Immunologic checkpoint blockade with antibodies that target cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( P16410 ) and the programmed cell death protein 1 pathway ( P18621 / Q9NZQ7 ) have demonstrated promise in a variety of malignancies . DB06186 ( P16410 ) and pembrolizumab ( P18621 ) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma , and additional regulatory approvals are expected across the oncologic spectrum for a variety of other agents that target these pathways . Treatment with both P16410 and P18621 / Q9NZQ7 blockade is associated with a unique pattern of adverse events called immune-related adverse events , and occasionally , unusual kinetics of tumor response are seen . Combination approaches involving P16410 and P18621 / Q9NZQ7 blockade are being investigated to determine whether they enhance the efficacy of either approach alone . Principles learned during the development of P16410 and P18621 / Q9NZQ7 approaches will likely be used as new immunologic checkpoint blocking antibodies begin clinical investigation .
