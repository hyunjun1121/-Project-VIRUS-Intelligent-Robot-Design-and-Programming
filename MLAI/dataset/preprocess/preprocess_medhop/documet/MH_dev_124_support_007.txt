Cystatin D is a candidate tumor suppressor gene induced by vitamin D in human colon cancer cells . The active vitamin D metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] has wide but not fully understood antitumor activity . A previous transcriptomic analysis of DB00136 action on human colon cancer cells revealed cystatin D ( P28325 ) , which encodes an inhibitor of several cysteine proteases of the cathepsin family , as a candidate target gene . Here we report that DB00136 induced vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) binding to , and activation of , the P28325 promoter and increased P28325 RNA and protein levels in human colon cancer cells . In cells lacking endogenous cystatin D , ectopic cystatin D expression inhibited both proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo . Furthermore , cystatin D inhibited migration and anchorage-independent growth , antagonized the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway , and repressed c-MYC expression . Cystatin D repressed expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers O95863 , O43623 , P37275 , and O60315 and , conversely , induced P12830 and other adhesion proteins . P28325 knockdown using shRNA abrogated the antiproliferative effect of DB00136 , attenuated P12830 expression , and increased c-MYC expression . In human colorectal tumors , expression of cystatin D correlated with expression of P11473 and P12830 , and loss of cystatin D correlated with poor tumor differentiation . Based on these data , we propose that P28325 has tumor suppressor activity that may contribute to the antitumoral action of DB00136 in colon cancer .
