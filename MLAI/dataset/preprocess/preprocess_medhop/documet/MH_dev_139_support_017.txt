DB00741 is a suppressor of apoptosis in bovine corpus luteum . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) acts as a modulator of physiological functions in several organs . In the present study , we examined whether GC suppresses luteolysis in bovine corpus luteum ( CL ) . DB00741 ( an active GC ) reduced the mRNA expression of caspase 8 ( Q14790 ) and caspase 3 ( P42574 ) and reduced the enzymatic activity of P42574 and cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) in cultured bovine luteal cells . mRNAs and proteins of GC receptor ( P04150 ) , 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( P28845 ) , and P80365 were expressed in CL throughout the estrous cycle . Moreover , the protein expression and the enzymatic activity of P28845 were high at the early and the midluteal stages compared to the regressed luteal stage . These results suggest that cortisol suppresses P01375 - P01579 -induced apoptosis in vitro by reducing apoptosis signals via Q14790 and P42574 in bovine CL and that the local increase in cortisol production resulting from increased P28845 at the early and midluteal stages helps to maintain CL function by suppressing apoptosis of luteal cells .
