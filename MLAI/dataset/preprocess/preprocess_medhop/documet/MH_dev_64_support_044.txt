Activation of IL-6R/ P23458 / P40763 signaling induces de novo resistance to irreversible P00533 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer with T790M resistance mutation . The secondary T790M mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is the major mechanism of acquired resistance to P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Although irreversible P00533 TKIs , such as afatinib or dacomitinib , have been introduced to overcome the acquired resistance , they showed a limited efficacy in NSCLC with T790M . Herein , we identified the novel de novo resistance mechanism to irreversible P00533 TKIs in H1975 and Q8NBP7 -GR cells , which are NSCLC cells with P00533 T790M . DB08916 activated interleukin-6 receptor ( IL-6R ) / P23458 / P40763 signaling via autocrine P05231 secretion in both cells . Inhibition of IL-6R/ P23458 / P40763 signaling pathway increased the sensitivity to afatinib . Cancer cells showed stronger P40763 activation and enhanced resistance to afatinib in the presence of MRC5 lung fibroblasts . Blockade of IL-6R/ P23458 significantly increased the sensitivity to afatinib through inhibition of afatinib-induced P40763 activation augmented by the interaction with fibroblasts , suggesting a critical role of paracrine IL-6R/ P23458 / P40763 loop between fibroblasts and cancer cells in the development of drug resistance . The enhancement of afatinib sensitivity by inhibition of IL-6R/ P23458 / P40763 signaling was confirmed in in vivo Q8NBP7 -GR xenograft model . Similar to afatinib , de novo resistance to dacomitinib in H1975 and Q8NBP7 -GR cells was also mediated by dacomitinib-induced P23458 / P40763 activation . Taken together , these findings suggest that IL-6R/ P23458 / P40763 signaling can be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of irreversible P00533 TKIs in patients with P00533 T790M .
