Risks of human limb deficiency anomalies associated with 29 SNPs of genes involved in homocysteine metabolism , coagulation , cell-cell interactions , inflammatory response , and blood pressure regulation . This study explored risks of limb deficiency anomalies associated with 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of genes involved in homocysteine metabolism , coagulation , cell-cell interaction , inflammatory response , and blood pressure regulation . The authors genotyped 96 cases and 437 non-malformed controls from a California population-based case-control study ( 1987-1988 birth cohort ) . Increased risk of limb anomaly was observed for three SNPs : heterozygosity for P12259 Arg506Gln , with an odds ratio ( OR ) of 2.5 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.0 , 6.5 ) ; heterozygosity for P01375 (-376)G > A , OR 2.1 ( 0.7 , 6.2 ) ; and homozygosity for P01160 2238T > C , OR 4.0 ( 1.1 , 15.4 ) . We hypothesized that effects of variant genotypes in the presence of maternal smoking , and/or in the absence of supplement intake , may exceed effects of any of these factors alone . In particular , findings for polymorphisms in P05121 , P17301 , P16581 , P01375 , P01374 , P01160 , P16520 , and P07550 supported the hypotheses , both for smoking and for supplement intake . These results suggest involvement of genetic variation of biologically relevant candidate genes , and gene-environment interaction , for some limb anomalies whose pathogenesis may be related to altered vascular tone or integrity .
