[ A molecular study of methylmalonic aciduria : structure-function correlations ] . Cobalamin ( DB00115 ) non-responsive methylmalonic acidemia is caused by mutations in the P22033 locus on chromosome 6p21 encoding the enzyme methylmalonyl DB01992 mutase ( EC 5.4.99.2 ) . This disorder has been extensively studied by biochemical , somatic cell genetic and molecular techniques . Mutations have been identified which cause classic mut(o) phenotypes in which there is no detectable enzymatic activity , as well as mut- phenotypes in which there is residual cobalamin-dependent activity . Mutations which exhibit interallelic complementation have been identified within both of these groups . These mutations illustrate the position , structure , and function of critical domains within this cobalamin binding enzyme and provide new insights into the biochemical and clinical consequences of enzyme deficiency . The homology of the cobalamin binding region has allowed mutations of the mutase to be mapped onto the x-ray structure of methionine synthase ( EC 2.1.1.13 ) .
