Beyond statins : new lipid lowering strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk . Statins are the first-line therapy in LDL- DB04540 ( LDL-C ) reduction and its clinical use has contributed to significant prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease . Yet , a significant proportion of patients remain at high risk . Recently , a number of new therapies have been developed to further lower LDL-C . These agents may provide clinical benefit on top of statin therapy in patients with high residual risk , severe hypercholesterolemia or as an alternative for patients who are intolerant to statins . We review four novel approaches based on the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) , apolipoprotein-B100 ( apoB ) , Cholesteryl ester transport protein ( P11597 ) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) . ApoB and P55157 inhibitors ( DB05528 and DB08827 ) are indicated only for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients . The results of ongoing trials with P11597 and Q8NBP7 inhibitors may warrant a wider employment in different categories of patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease .
