P00797 status does not predict the anti-hypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African-Americans . DB00519 Multicenter Study Group . The angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor trandolapril , a non-sulfhydryl prodrug which is hydrolysed into trandolaprilat , was studied in 322 hypertensives of African-American descent using a double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , parallel study design . Following 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or 0.25 to 16 mg/day trandolapril , an analysis of drug effect on trough blood pressure ( BP ) stratified by age , gender , weight , pre-treatment plasma renin activity , and trandolaprilat concentration was performed . Two mg was the lowest effective trandolapril dose , whereas doses above 4 mg did not significantly reduce trough BP . Reduction in BP did not correlate with trough plasma trandolaprilat concentration . Pre-treatment plasma renin activity was not a reliable indicator of anti-hypertensive response , as similar reductions in BP occurred even in patients with the lowest renin levels . There were no observable differences based on age , gender or measurements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis . In conclusion , neither age , gender or plasma renin activity influenced anti-hypertensive response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in African-Americans .
