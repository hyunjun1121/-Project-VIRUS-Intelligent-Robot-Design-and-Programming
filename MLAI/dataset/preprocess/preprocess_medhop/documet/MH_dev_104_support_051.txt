Specific components of prostanoid-signaling pathways are present in non-small cell lung cancer cells . In the present study , we measured prostanoid synthesis and the expression of genes associated with prostanoid signaling in human non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) cell lines and in primary human tumors . Consistent with the proposed growth promoting role of DB00917 , we found that NSCLC cell lines frequently co-expressed the genes encoding cyclooxygenase-2 and the prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) receptors EP1 , 2 and 4 concomitant with the synthesis of DB00917 . In contrast , NSCLC cells did not synthesize appreciable amounts of prostaglandin I2 ( DB01240 , prostacyclin ) , lacked DB01240 synthase ( PGIS ) and did not express the gene coding for the P43119 IP at detectable levels . In agreement with this finding , PGIS mRNA levels were dramatically diminished in primary human tumor samples as compared to matched normal lung tissue . Finally , thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) was synthesized in NSCLC cell lines , but transcription of the gene coding for the TxA2 receptor TP was not observed in these cells . In marked contrast , lung fibroblasts synthesized all three prostanoids and their receptors at high levels . While the observed expression patterns were consistent with the existence of autocrine/paracrine DB00917 signaling loops in NSCLC cells , DB01240 - and TxA2-mediated signals may play a role in tumor stroma cells .
