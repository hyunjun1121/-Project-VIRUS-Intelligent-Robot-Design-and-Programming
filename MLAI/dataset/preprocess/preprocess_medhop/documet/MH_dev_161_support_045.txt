P52333 activity is necessary for phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin E2 synthesis by macrophages infected with Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain . Francisella tularensis , the causative agent of tularemia , modulates the host immune response to gain a survival advantage within the host . One mechanism of immune evasion is the ability of F. tularensis to induce the synthesis of the small lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) , which alters the host T cell response making the host more susceptible to Francisella growth . DB00917 is synthesized by a tightly regulated biosynthetic pathway following stimulation . The synthesis of DB00917 begins with the liberation of arachidonic acid ( AA ) from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) . AA is subsequently converted to the unstable intermediate PGH2 by cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , and PGH2 undergoes an isomerization reaction to generate DB00917 . Our objective was to identify F. tularensis-activated host signaling pathways that regulate the activity of the enzymes in the DB00917 -biosynthetic pathway . In this study , we show that P47712 , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , and P52333 ( P52333 ) signaling are necessary for F. tularensis-induced DB00917 production . Inhibition of P52333 activity reduced the phosphorylation of P47712 and P35354 protein levels . In addition , P52333 regulates P47712 phosphorylation independent of transcription . Moreover , p38 MAPK activity is required for F. tularensis-induced P35354 protein synthesis , but not for the phosphorylation of P47712 . This research highlights a unique signaling axis in which P52333 and p38 MAPK regulate the activity of multiple enzymes of the DB00917 -biosynthetic pathway in macrophages infected with F. tularensis .
