Quantitative evaluation of reference genes for real-time PCR during in vitro maturation of ovine oocytes . Quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( RT-qPCR ) is a powerful molecular technique that enables gene expression studies to be performed on extremely small samples such as oocytes and pre-implantation embryos . However , the high sensitivity of this technique requires that to prevent bias in expression data interpretation , the reference genes used for normalization are fully validated before use . Difficulties in choosing a reference gene are further compounded by the variable RNA content of the maturing oocyte . In the present study , we evaluated eight commonly used reference genes such as P60709 , P04406 , P0C0S5 , P00492 , P62937 , P31040 , P07437 and P63104 and for sheep oocyte RT-qPCR before and after in vitro maturation . We have also compared different cDNA priming strategies using random hexamers or oligo-dT . GeNorm analysis of the results identified the most reliable genes for normalization to be P31040 , P07437 and P62937 when oocyte cDNA was made with random hexamers , and P63104 , P07437 and P31040 when oligo-dT primers were used ( P0C0S5 and P00492 were excluded from the geNorm analysis ) . Interestingly , the analysis revealed that the least stable genes were P60709 and P04406 , which are the conventional ' housekeeping ' genes used in many studies . We recommend the use of three reference genes to calculate a normalization factor to accurately quantify transcript abundance in sheep oocytes and these vary with the cDNA priming strategy employed .
