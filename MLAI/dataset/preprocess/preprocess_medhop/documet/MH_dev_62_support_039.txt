Meta-analysis : the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol in Crohn 's disease . BACKGROUND : DB08904 is the third anti- P01375 agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States . AIM : To provide a comprehensive up-to-date review of the efficacy and safety of certolizumab in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . METHODS : Electronic databases , including PubMed , EMBASE , the Cochrane library and the Science Citation Index , were searched to retrieve relevant trials . In addition , meeting abstracts and the reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed for further relevant studies . RESULTS : Three trials , enrolling a total of 1040 patients , are included in the meta-analysis to evaluate the short-term efficacy of certolizumab , which is effective for rapid induction and long-term maintenance of clinical response or remission and can improve quality of life in patients with Crohn 's disease . Certolizumab is also effective for patients who have lost response to infliximab . However , its efficacy in infliximab-exposed patients is probably less than in infliximab-naive patients . Re-induction with certolizumab in patients who have flared on maintenance therapy can rescue a significant proportion of patients . There is no significant association between the efficacy of certolizumab and the baseline P02741 level . In comparison with placebo , certolizumab does not increase the risk of serious adverse events . CONCLUSIONS : Certolizumab is effective and safe in treating Crohn 's disease . Further studies are still required to assess its full safety profile .
