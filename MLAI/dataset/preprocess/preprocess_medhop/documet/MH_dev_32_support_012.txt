P03372 alpha augments changes in hemostatic gene expression in HepG2 cells treated with estradiol and phytoestrogens . Phytoestrogens are popular alternatives to estrogen therapy however their effects on hemostasis in post-menopausal women are unknown . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the phytoestrogens , genistein , daidzein and equol on the expression of key genes from the hemostatic system in human hepatocyte cell models and to determine the role of estrogen receptors in mediating any response seen . HepG2 cells and Hep89 cells ( expressing estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) ) were incubated for 24 h with 50 nM 17β-estradiol , genistein , daidzein or equol . Tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , Factor VII , fibrinogen γ , protein C and protein S mRNA expression were determined using TaqMan PCR . DB01645 and equol increased tPA and P05121 expression in Hep89 cells with fold changes greater than those observed for estradiol . In HepG2 cells ( which do not express ERα ) , P05121 and tPA expression were unchanged . Increased expression of Factor VII was observed in phytoestrogen treated Hep89 cells but not in similarly treated HepG2s . P00734 gene expression was increased in equol and daidzein treated HepG2 cells in the absence of the classical estrogen receptors . These data suggest that phytoestrogens can regulate the expression of coagulation and fibrinolytic genes in a human hepatocyte cell line ; an effect which is augmented by ERα .
