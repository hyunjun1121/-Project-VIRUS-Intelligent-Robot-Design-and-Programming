Activation of serotonin receptor-2B rescues small-for-size liver graft failure in mice . The implantation of grafts below 30 % of the normal liver volume is associated with a high risk of failure known as small-for-size ( SFS ) syndrome . Strategies to rescue small grafts may have a dramatic impact on organ shortage . Serotonin is a potent growth factor for the liver . The goal of this study was to determine whether enhanced serotonin signaling could prevent the deleterious effects of SFS syndrome . We performed 30 % normal liver volume transplantations in wild-type C57/BL6 and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) (-/-) mice . Some animals received α-methyl-5-HT ( DOI ) , an agonist of serotonin receptor-2 ( P41595 ) . Endpoints included long-term survival , serum and hepatic markers of liver injury and regeneration , assessment of hepatic microcirculation by intravital fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy , and transcript levels of a variety of serotonin receptors , tumor necrosis factor α , and P05231 . All recipients of small grafts ( controls ) died within 2-4 days of transplantation , whereas half of those receiving DOI survived permanently . Control animals disclosed major liver injury , including diffuse microvesicular steatosis in hepatocytes , impairment of microcirculation , and a failure of regeneration , whereas these parameters were dramatically improved in animals subjected to DOI . Blockage of P41595 blunted the protective effects of DOI . Whereas P05231 levels were higher in DOI-treated animals , P05231 (-/-) mice were still protected by DOI , suggesting a protective pathway independent of P05231 . CONCLUSION : Serotonin through its action on receptor-2B protects SFS liver grafts from injury and prevents microcirculation and regeneration . The mechanism of hepato-protection is independent of P05231 .
