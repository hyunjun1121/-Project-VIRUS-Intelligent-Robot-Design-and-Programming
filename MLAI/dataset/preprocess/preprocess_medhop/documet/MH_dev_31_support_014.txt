Aerosol vaccination with AERAS-402 elicits robust cellular immune responses in the lungs of rhesus macaques but fails to protect against high-dose Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge . Development of a vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis may require immunization strategies that induce a high frequency of Ag-specific P01730 and CD8 T cells in the lung . The nonhuman primate model is essential for testing such approaches because it has predictive value for how vaccines elicit responses in humans . In this study , we used an aerosol vaccination strategy to administer AERAS-402 , a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus ( rAd ) type 35 expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ags Ag85A , Ag85B , and TB10.4 , in bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) -primed or unprimed rhesus macaques . Immunization with BCG generated low purified protein derivative-specific P01730 T cell responses in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage . In contrast , aerosolized AERAS-402 alone or following BCG induced potent and stable Ag85A/b-specific P01730 and CD8 effector T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage that largely produced IFN-γ , as well as P01375 and P60568 . Such responses induced by BCG , AERAS-402 , or both failed to confer overall protection following challenge with 275 CFUs M. tuberculosis Erdman , although vaccine-induced responses associated with reduced pathology were observed in some animals . Anamnestic T cell responses to Ag85A/b were not detected in blood of immunized animals after challenge . Overall , our data suggest that a high M. tuberculosis challenge dose may be a critical factor in limiting vaccine efficacy in this model . However , the ability of aerosol rAd immunization to generate potent cellular immunity in the lung suggests that using different or more immunogens , alternative rAd serotypes with enhanced immunogenicity , and a physiological challenge dose may achieve protection against M. tuberculosis .
