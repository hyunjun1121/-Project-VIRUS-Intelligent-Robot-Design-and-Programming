Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors as a novel approach for the treatment of respiratory disease : cilomilast . Phosphodiesterase-4 ( DB05876 ) is an important DB02527 -metabolising enzyme in immune and inflammatory cells , airway smooth muscle and pulmonary nerves . The phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) enzyme plays a significant role in modulating the activity of DB02527 , an important second messenger that mediates the relaxation of airway smooth muscle and suppresses inflammatory cell function , thereby attenuating the inflammatory response . Selective inhibitors of this enzyme show a broad spectrum of activity in animal models of P48444 and asthma . These drugs block the hydrolysis of DB02527 via inhibition of DB05876 and are attractive candidates for novel anti-inflammatory drugs . At present , two second-generation DB05876 inhibitors for the treatment of P48444 and asthma patients are being tested in clinical Phase III trials . The most advanced compound is the orally active , selective DB05876 inhibitor cilomilast ( DB03849 , SB-207499 , cis-4-cyano-4-[3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ; GlaxoSmithKline ) . DB03849 shows high selectivity for DB02527 -specific DB05876 , an isoenzyme that predominates in pro-inflammatory and immune cells and that is 10-fold more selective for Q08499 than for P27815 , -B or -C . In vitro , cilomilast suppresses the activity of several pro-inflammatory and immune cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and P48444 . Moreover , it is highly active in animal models of these diseases . DB03849 has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo . It is orally active and may be effective in the treatment of asthma and P48444 ; however , complete assessment of the therapeutic value of this novel compound class must await the outcome of longer-term clinical trials . This review presents a summary of the preclinical and clinical profile of cilomilast in patients with P48444 .
