Germline mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma in Korea . The aim of our study was to assess the frequency of germline mutations and develop the genetic testing strategy in patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma ( PPGL ) in Korea . We included 53 patients diagnosed with non-syndromic PPGL without a family history of PPGLs in three referral centers from 2004 to 2011 . DB00139 dehydrogenase complex B ( P21912 ) , O14521 , Von Hippel-Lindau ( P40337 ) , and rearranged during transfection ( P07949 ) genes were examined by direct sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification . The study patients were composed of 26 men and 27 women , and mean age was 50.1 Â± 13.5 years . The frequency of germline mutations was 13.2 % ( 7/53 ) : P07949 ( n = 2 ) , P40337 ( n = 1 ) , P21912 ( n = 2 ) , and O14521 ( n = 2 ) . Six of seven mutation carriers were diagnosed before the age of 50 . One of two patients harboring an P21912 mutation had malignant PPGLs . One patient with multifocal head and neck paraganglioma ( PGL ) and pheochromocytoma ( PHEO ) carried a O14521 mutation . The carriers of germline mutations in patients with apparently sporadic PPGL were 13.2 % in our study . We recommend genetic testing in patients below 50 years and O14521 genetic testing in patients with multifocal PPGLs . In malignant PPGLs , P21912 genetic testing may be performed .
