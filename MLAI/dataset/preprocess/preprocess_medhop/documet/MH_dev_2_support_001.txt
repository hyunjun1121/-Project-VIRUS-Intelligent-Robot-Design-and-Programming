cDNA array analysis of cytokines , chemokines , and receptors involved in the development of TNBS-induced colitis : homeostatic role of P01282 . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) is a chronic inflammatory pathology of the intestine , characterized by diarrhea and weight loss . A healing effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) in the murine model of CD based on 2,4,6-trinitrobencene sulfonic acid ( TNBS ) administration has been previously shown . The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of several mediators related to the inflammatory cascade in colitic and P01282 -treated animals . With this aim , mice received either only TNBS or TNBS and P01282 treatment on alternate days . cDNA microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on total mRNA from colon to study the expression of a battery of proinflammatory molecules such as the enzyme P35354 , the chemokines P78423 , P48061 , O43927 , O95715 , P51681 , and P25025 , and the cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , IL-12 , Q14116 , P22301 , interferon-gamma , and P05112 . TNBS administration induced the expression of all the proinflammatory mediators studied , whereas P01282 treatment reduced their levels , increasing the anti-inflammatory P22301 and the TH2 cytokine P05112 , explaining its beneficial action through inhibition of the inflammatory/ Q8IXH7 response . These data describe not only the relation of several proinflammatory mediators to the development of TNBS colitis , reporting their time-course , but also show the beneficial action of P01282 in this model through complete blockage of the inflammatory cascade and recovery of the colon homeostasis , providing a potential new alternative for CD therapy .
