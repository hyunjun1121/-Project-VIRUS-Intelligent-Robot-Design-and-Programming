DB00082 : current and potential novel therapeutic applications . BACKGROUND : DB00082 is a genetically engineered molecule , which exhibits specific growth hormone ( GH ) antagonism by directly interacting with the P10912 . It is currently licensed for the treatment of acromegaly where surgery and medical therapy with somatostatin analogues have failed . OBJECTIVE : To delineate the role of pegvisomant in the treatment of acromegaly and its novel application in other areas of clinical medicine where suppression of GH action may be of therapeutic benefit . METHODS : A literature review from PubMed- and EMBASE-listed publications and the web-sites of licensing organisations for medicinal products . CONCLUSION : DB00082 is currently used as a second line therapy in the management of acromegaly . It is highly effective in suppressing the metabolic effects of elevated GH levels when used alone or in combination with somatostatin analogues . However , its long term efficacy and safety for this indication has yet to be established . Preliminary data indicate that pegvisomant may have a role in management of type 1 diabetes with beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and in preventing the progression of microvascular complications . Additional roles as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy regimens and for the diagnosis of GH deficiency have been proposed , but have yet to be confirmed .
