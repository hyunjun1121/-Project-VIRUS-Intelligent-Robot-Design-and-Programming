DB00065 and insulin resistance . P01308 resistance is the most important pathophysiologic feature of obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetic states . P01375 , a proinflammatory cytokine , plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated insulin resistance during the course of rheumatic diseases . Therapies aimed at neutralizing P01375 , such as the monoclonal antibody infliximab , represent a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and allow to obtain significant results in terms of control of the inflammatory process . In this article we reviewed the scientific evidence published in the literature about a potential role of P01375 blockade in improving insulin resistance in non-diabetic rheumatic patients .
