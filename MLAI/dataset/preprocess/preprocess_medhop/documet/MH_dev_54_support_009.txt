Surface proteins of P13671 /36 cells involved in dengue virus 4 binding and entry . Dengue virus ( DENV ) is the causative agent of the most important mosquito-borne viral disease , which is endemic to over 100 countries in tropical and subtropical areas of the world . It is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes . The first step in the viral infection of host cells is virion attachment to the plasma membrane , which is mediated by specific surface molecules . There are several molecules that participate in DENV infection of mosquitoes , but only a few have been identified . In this work , we co-purified 4 proteins from P13671 /36 cells using a recombinant DENV 4 E protein and identified them as 70 kDa Heat Shock and 70 kDa Heat Shock cognate proteins ( HSP70/HSc70 ) , Binding immunoglobulin protein ( P11021 ) , P10599 /protein disulphide isomerase ( P07237 ) , and 44 kDa Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein ( Q9BS26 ) via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight ( Maldi-ToF ) analysis . Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays , we observed re-localisation of HSP70/HSc70 and , to a lesser extent , P11021 to the plasma membrane under stress conditions , such as during DENV infection . By performing binding and infection assays independently , we found that all 4 proteins participate in both processes , but to differing extents : HSP70/HSc70 is the most critical component , while Q9BS26 is less important . Viral infection was not inhibited when the cells were incubated with antibodies against all of the surface proteins after virus binding , which suggests that DENV entry to P13671 /36 cells is mediated by these proteins at the same step and not sequentially .
