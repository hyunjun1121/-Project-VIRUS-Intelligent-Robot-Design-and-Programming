DB00098 -associated Cd4+ T-cell depletion and infection risk in HIV-infected renal transplant recipients . HIV-infected patients are increasingly referred for kidney transplantation , and may be at an increased risk for rejection . Treatment for rejection frequently includes thymoglobulin . We studied thymoglobulin 's effect on P01730 + T-cell count , risk of infection and rejection reversal in 20 consecutive HIV-infected kidney recipients . All patients used antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis . Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of prednisone , mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine . Eleven patients received thymoglobulin ( 7 for rejection and 4 for delayed/slow graft function ) while 9 did not . These two groups were similar in age , gender , race , donor characteristics and immunosuppression . Mean P01730 + T-cell counts remained stable in patients who did not receive thymoglobulin , but became profoundly suppressed in those who did , decreasing from 475 +/- 192 to 9 +/- 10 cells/microL ( p < 0.001 ) . Recovery time ranged from 3 weeks to 2 years despite effective HIV suppression . Although opportunistic infections were successfully suppressed , low P01730 + T-cell count was associated with increased risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization . Rejection reversed in 6 of 7 patients receiving thymoglobulin . We conclude that thymoglobulin reverses acute rejection in HIV-infected kidney recipients , but produces profound and long-lasting suppression of the P01730 + T-cell count associated with increased risk of infections requiring hospitalization .
