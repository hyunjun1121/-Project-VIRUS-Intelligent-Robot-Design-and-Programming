A phase I/II study of sunitinib and intensive chemotherapy in patients over 60 years of age with acute myeloid leukaemia and activating P36888 mutations . Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) with P36888 mutation has a dismal prognosis in elderly patients . Treatment with a combination of P36888 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy has not been extensively studied . Therefore , we instigated a phase I/II clinical trial of chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside ( DB00987 ) /daunorubicin induction ( 7+3 ) followed by three cycles of intermediate-dose DB00987 consolidation in 22 AML patients with activating P36888 mutations . DB01268 was added at predefined dose levels and as maintenance therapy for 2 years . At dose level 1 , sunitinib 25 mg daily continuously from day 1 onwards resulted in two cases with dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , prolonged haemotoxicity and hand-foot syndrome . At dose level -1 , sunitinib 25 mg was restricted to days 1-7 of each chemotherapy cycle . One DLT was observed in six evaluable patients . Six additional patients were treated in an extension phase . Thirteen of 22 patients ( 59 % ; 8/14 with P36888 -internal tandem duplication and 5/8 with P36888 -tyrosine kinase domain ) achieved a complete remission/complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery . For the 17 patients included at the lower dose level , median overall , relapse-free and event-free survival were 1·6 , 1·0 and 0·4 years , respectively . Four out of five analysed patients with relapse during maintenance therapy lost their initial P36888 mutation , suggesting outgrowth of P36888 wild-type subclones .
