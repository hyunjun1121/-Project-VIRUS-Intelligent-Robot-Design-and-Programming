Polymorphisms in genes implicated in dopamine , serotonin and noradrenalin metabolism suggest association with cerebrospinal fluid monoamine metabolite concentrations in psychosis . BACKGROUND : Homovanillic acid ( HVA ) , 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol ( MHPG ) are the major monoamine metabolites in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Their cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) concentrations , reflecting the monoamine turnover rates in CNS , are partially under genetic influence and have been associated with schizophrenia . We have hypothesized that P04141 monoamine metabolite concentrations represent intermediate steps between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in genes implicated in monoaminergic pathways and psychosis . METHODS : We have searched for association between 119 SNPs in genes implicated in monoaminergic pathways [ tryptophan hydroxylase 1 ( P17752 ) , Q8IWU9 , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) , P20711 ( DDC ) , dopamine beta-hydroxylase ( P09172 ) , catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) , monoamine oxidase A ( P21397 ) and P27338 ] and monoamine metabolite concentrations in P04141 in 74 patients with psychotic disorder . RESULTS : There were 42 nominally significant associations between SNPs and P04141 monoamine metabolite concentrations , which exceeded the expected number ( 20 ) of nominal associations given the total number of tests performed . The strongest association ( p = 0.0004 ) was found between P27338 rs5905512 , a SNP previously reported to be associated with schizophrenia in men , and MHPG concentrations in men with psychotic disorder . Further analyses in 111 healthy individuals revealed that 41 of the 42 nominal associations were restricted to patients with psychosis and were absent in healthy controls . CONCLUSIONS : The present study suggests that altered monoamine turnover rates in CNS reflect intermediate steps in the associations between SNPs and psychosis .
