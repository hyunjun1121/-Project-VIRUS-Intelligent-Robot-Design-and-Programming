The Medicinal Timber Canarium patentinervium Miq . ( Burseraceae Kunth. ) Is an Anti-Inflammatory Bioresource of Dual Inhibitors of Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and 5-Lipoxygenase ( 5- P28300 ) . The barks and leaves extracts of Canarium patentinervium Miq . ( Burseraceae Kunth. ) were investigated for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and P09917 ( P28300 ) inhibition via in vitro models . The corresponding antioxidative power of the plant extract was also tested via nonenzyme and enzyme in vitro assays . The ethanolic extract of leaves inhibited the enzymatic activity of 5- P28300 , P23219 , and P35354 with IC50 equal to 49.66 ± 0.02 μg/mL , 0.60 ± 0.01 μg/mL , and 1.07 ± 0.01 μg/mL , respectively , with selective P35354 activity noted in ethanolic extract of barks with P23219 / P35354 ratio of 1.22 . The ethanol extract of barks confronted oxidation in the ABTS , DPPH , and P42345 assay with EC50 values equal to 0.93 ± 0.01 μg/mL , 2.33 ± 0.02 μg/mL , and 67.00 ± 0.32 μg/mL , respectively , while the ethanol extract of leaves confronted oxidation in β-carotene bleaching assay and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) assay with EC50 value of 6.04 ± 0.02 μg/mL and IC50 value of 3.05 ± 0.01 μg/mL . The ethanol extract acts as a dual inhibitor of P28300 and P36551 enzymes with potent antioxidant capacity . The clinical significance of these data is quite clear that they support a role for Canarium patentinervium Miq . ( Burseraceae Kunth. ) as a source of lead compounds in the management of inflammatory diseases .
