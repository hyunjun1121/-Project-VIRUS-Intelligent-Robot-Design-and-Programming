Effects of systemic injections of vilazodone , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin 1A receptor agonist , on anxiety induced by predator stress in rats . We examined the effect of DB06684 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) and serotonin 1A ( 5-HT(1A) ) receptor agonist [ Bartoszyk , G.D. , Hegenbart , R. , Ziegler , H. , 1997. P50402 68843 , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with selective presynaptic P08908 receptor agonistic properties. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 322 , 147-153. ] , on change in affect following predator stress . DB06684 and vehicle injection ( intraperitoneal ) occurred either 10 min after predator stress ( prophylactic testing ) , or 90 min prior to behavioral testing for the effects of predator stress ( therapeutic testing ) . Predator stress involved unprotected exposure of rats to a domestic cat . Behavioral effects of stress were evaluated with hole board , plus-maze , and acoustic startle tests 1 week after stress . Predator stress increased anxiety-like behavior in the plus-maze and elevated response to acoustic startle . In prophylactic testing , DB06684 affected stress potentiation of startle at doses above 5 mg/kg . DB06684 increased stress elevation of startle at 10 mg/kg . Higher doses of DB06684 ( 20 and 40 mg/kg ) blocked stress potentiation of startle . In contrast , DB06684 had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze . In therapeutic testing , DB06684 increased stress elevation of startle at all doses . In contrast , therapeutic DB06684 had no effect on stress potentiation of anxiety in the plus-maze . Taken together , the data suggest a prophylactic potential for DB06684 in the treatment of changes in hypervigilance following severe stress .
