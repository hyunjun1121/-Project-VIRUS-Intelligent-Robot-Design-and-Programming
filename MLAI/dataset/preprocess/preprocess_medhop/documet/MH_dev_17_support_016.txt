Phosphodiesterase inhibitors control A172 human glioblastoma cell death through DB02527 -mediated activation of protein kinase A and Epac1/Rap1 pathways . AIMS : We investigated whether DB02527 -mediated protein kinase A(PKA) and Epac1/Rap1 pathways differentially affect brain tumor cell death using 4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone(rolipram) , specific phosphodiesterase type IV ( PDE IV ) inhibitor . MAIN METHODS : A172 and U87MG human glioblastoma cells were used . Percentage of cell survival was determined by MTT assay . PKA and Epac1/Rap1 activation was determined by western blotting and pull-down assay , respectively . Cell cycle and hypodiploid cell formation were assessed by flow cytometry analysis . KEY FINDINGS : Non-specific PDE inhibitors , isobutylmethylxanthine( DB07954 ) and theophylline reduce survival percentage of A172 and U87MG cells . The expression of P27815 and Q07343 was detected in A172 and U87MG cells . DB01954 -treated A172 or U87MG cell survival was lower in the presence of forskolin , adenylate cyclase activator , than that in its absence . Co-treatment with rolipram and forskolin also enhanced CREB phosphorylation on serine 133 that was inhibited by H-89 , PKA inhibitor and DB02527 -responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1(Epac1) , a Rap GDP exchange factor-mediated Rap1 activity in A172 cells . When A172 cells were treated with cell-permeable dibutyryl- DB02527 (dbcAMP) , PKA activator or 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate(CPT) , Epac1 activator , basal level of cell death was increased and cell cycle was arrested at the phase of G2/M . DB01954 -induced A172 cell death was also increased by the co-treatment with dbcAMP or CPT , but it was inhibited by the pre-treatment with H-89 . SIGNIFICANCE : These findings demonstrate that PKA and Epac1/Rap1 pathways could cooperatively play a role in rolipram-induced brain tumor cell death . It suggests that rolipram might regulate glioblastoma cell density through dual pathways of PKA- and Epac1/Rap1-mediated cell death and cell cycle arrest .
