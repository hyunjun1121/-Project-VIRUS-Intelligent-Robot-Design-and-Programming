Kirenol stimulates osteoblast differentiation through activation of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MC3T3-E1 cells . Kirenol has been reported to possess anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory , anti-allergic , anti-adipogenic , and anti-arthritic activities ; however , its effect on osteoblast differentiation has not yet been reported . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of kirenol on osteoblast differentiation through activation of the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MC3T3-E1 cells . Kirenol markedly promoted alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity and mineralization . Kirenol not only increased the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers , such as ALP , type I collagen ( ColA1 ) , and osteopontin ( P10451 ) , but also increased the expression of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand ( O00300 / O14788 ) ratio . The effects of kirenol on osteoblast differentiation were accompanied by stimulating the expression of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways , including P12643 , runt-related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2 ) , osterix ( Osx ) , low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 ( O75197 ) , disheveled 2 ( O14641 ) , β-catenin , cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) , and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β ) . In addition , kirenol up-regulated the expression of β-catenin , P24385 , ALP , and ColA1 which were down-regulated by siRNA knockdown of β-catenin . Overall , these results demonstrate that kirenol is capable of promoting osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells through activation of the BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways , suggesting that it is a potential candidate target for treating or preventing osteoporosis .
