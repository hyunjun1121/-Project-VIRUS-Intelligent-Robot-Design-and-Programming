P35354 inhibition in clinical cancer prevention . Colorectal cancer is an excellent model for studying cancer prevention by means of secondary ( e.g. , polypectomy to remove a precursor adenoma ) and primary ( chemoprevention ) strategies . Evidence has shown that regular users of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have a reduction in risk of colorectal cancer . A possible mechanism of this benefit is decreased prostaglandin production , which is achieved through inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) activity , and possibly other pathways . Two isoforms of P36551 -- P23219 and P35354 -- have been identified . P35354 is expressed in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas , both in humans and rodents . Inhibition of P35354 has been shown to decrease the incidence of carcinogen-induced neoplasia in rats and to lower the incidence of adenomas in murine models . Several P35354 inhibitors , with the potential for less toxicity than that associated with traditional NSAIDs , are under development . This paper reviews potential chemoprevention of colorectal cancer using P35354 inhibitors in patients at increased risk , e.g. , patients with familial adenomatous polyposis , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer , and sporadic adenomas . Included are the rationale for use of such agents , results of a study showing a significant reduction in adenoma burden in familial adenomatous polyposis patients who received the selective P35354 inhibitor celecoxib ( DB00482 ) , and the design of other ongoing or planned clinical trials .
