Light chain of botulinum A neurotoxin expressed as an inclusion body from a synthetic gene is catalytically and functionally active . Botulinum neurotoxins , the most potent of all toxins , induce lethal neuromuscular paralysis by inhibiting exocytosis at the neuromuscular junction . The light chains ( LC ) of these dichain neurotoxins are a new class of zinc-endopeptidases that specifically cleave the synaptosomal proteins , P60880 , VAMP , or syntaxin at discrete sites . To facilitate the structural and functional characterization of these unique endopeptidases , we constructed a synthetic gene for the LC of the botulinum neurotoxin serotype A ( DB00083 ) , overexpressed it in Escherichia coli , and purified the gene product from inclusion bodies . Our procedure can provide 1.1 g of the LC from 1 L of culture . The LC product was stable in solution at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months . This rBoNT/A LC was proteolytically active , specifically cleaving the DB00142 - DB00125 bond in a 17-residue synthetic peptide of P60880 , the reported cleavage site of DB00083 . Its calculated catalytic efficiency kcat/Km was higher than that reported for the native DB00083 dichain . Treating the rBoNT/A LC with mercuric compounds completely abolished its activity , most probably by modifying the cysteine-164 residue located in the vicinity of the active site . About 70 % activity of the LC was restored by adding DB01593 to a DB01593 -free , apo-LC preparation . The LC was nontoxic to mice and failed to elicit neutralizing epitope(s) when the animals were vaccinated with this protein . In addition , injecting rBoNT/A LC into sea urchin eggs inhibited exocytosis-dependent plasma membrane resealing . For the first time , results of our study make available a large amount of the biologically active toxin fragment in a soluble and stable form .
