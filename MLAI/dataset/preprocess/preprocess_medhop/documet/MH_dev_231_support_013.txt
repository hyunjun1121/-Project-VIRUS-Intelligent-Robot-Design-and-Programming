[ Diagnosis of non-parasitic hypereosinophilia ] . Diagnosis of major hypereosinophilia ( > 1500 x 10(9)/L ) is complex because the possible causes cover the entire range of medical specialties . History and clinical condition will usually suggest parasitic or allergic diseases or drug reactions . When workups for them are negative , rarer causes must be suspected : specific organ diseases ( chronic eosinophilic pneumonia , bullous pemphigoid , etc. ) , solid tumor , clonal blood disorders , or vasculitis . When the condition is prolonged and unexplained , hypereosinophilic syndrome is diagnosed . A rare disorder , its prognosis depends on largely on its cardiac effects . It is usually associated with heterogeneous hematologic conditions , mainly myeloproliferative and lymphocytic disease . The myeloproliferative or primary variant sometimes follows chromosomal deletions that cause a fusion between the Fip1-like1 ( Q6UN15 ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) genes , thus increasing the tyrosine kinase activity of the latter . Imatinib mesylate , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , is usually effective in this situation . In the lymphocytic variant , hypereosinophilia is secondary to a primitive Th2 lymphocyte expansion that causes overproduction of interleukin 5 ( P05113 ) . Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy . DB06612 , an anti- P05113 monoclonal antibody , currently being evaluated , seems promising . Despite recent progress , about 40 % of the cases of hypereosinophilic syndrome remain unexplained .
