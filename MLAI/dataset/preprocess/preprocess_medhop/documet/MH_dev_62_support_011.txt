The efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol ( CZP ) in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) : a meta-analysis from nine randomized controlled trials . OBJECTIVE : DB08904 ( CZP ) is a novel anti- P01375 agent that is used for patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , the efficacy of CZP in RA remains controversial . Thus , we performed this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of CZP in the treatment of RA patients . METHODS : Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that evaluated the efficacy and safe of CZP in the patients with active RA . The primary outcome was American College of Rheumatology 20 % ( ACR20 ) , and secondary outcome were ACR50 , ACR70 , disease activity , patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) , and adverse events . A fixed-effect model or random-effect model was used to pool the estimates , depending on the absence or presence of heterogeneity among the included studies . RESULTS : Nine RCTs with a total of 5228 patients were included in this meta-analysis , and all of the patients were administered CZP or placebo . The pooled results showed that CZP significantly improved the ACR20 , ACR50 , ACR70 response rates , and physical function . CZP was associated with a statistically significant reduction in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints-Erythrocyte sedimentation rate , arthritis pain , and fatigue . Patients who received CZP treatment did not have a higher incidence of treatment-related adverse events , no matter in any intensity . CONCLUSIONS : CZP 200 or 400mg in the treatment of active RA significantly reduced the RA signs and symptoms , and improved physical function as compared with the placebo . More large-scale RCTs are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CZP in the treatment of active RA .
