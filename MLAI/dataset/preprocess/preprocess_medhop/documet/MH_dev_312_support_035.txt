Different cholinesterase inhibitor effects on P04141 cholinesterases in Alzheimer patients . BACKGROUND : The current study aimed to compare the effects of different cholinesterase inhibitors on acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) activities and protein levels , in the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) of Alzheimer disease ( AD ) patients . METHODS AND FINDINGS : AD patients aged 50-85 years were randomized to open-label treatment with oral rivastigmine , donepezil or galantamine for 13 weeks . P22303 and BuChE activities were assayed by Ellman 's colorimetric method . Protein levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Primary analyses were based on the Completer population ( randomized patients who completed Week 13 assessments ) . 63 patients were randomized to treatment . DB00989 was associated with decreased P22303 activity by 42.6 % and decreased P22303 protein levels by 9.3 % , and decreased BuChE activity by 45.6 % and decreased BuChE protein levels by 21.8 % . DB00674 decreased P22303 activity by 2.1 % and BuChE activity by 0.5 % , but increased P22303 protein levels by 51.2 % and BuChE protein levels by 10.5 % . Donepezil increased P22303 and BuChE activities by 11.8 % and 2.8 % , respectively . Donepezil caused a 215.2 % increase in P22303 and 0.4 % increase in BuChE protein levels . Changes in mean P22303 -Readthrough/Synaptic ratios , which might reflect underlying neurodegenerative processes , were 1.4 , 0.6 , and 0.4 for rivastigmine , donepezil and galantamine , respectively . CONCLUSION : The findings suggest pharmacologically-induced differences between rivastigmine , donepezil and galantamine . DB00989 provides sustained inhibition of P22303 and BuChE , while donepezil and galantamine do not inhibit BuChE and are associated with increases in P04141 P22303 protein levels . The clinical implications require evaluation .
