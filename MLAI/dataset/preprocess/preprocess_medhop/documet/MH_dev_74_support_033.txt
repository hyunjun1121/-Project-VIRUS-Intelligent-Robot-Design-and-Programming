The infection of human primary cells and cell lines by human cytomegalovirus : new tropism and new reservoirs for HCMV . Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) infection is asymptomatic in common persons and could reactive in immunosuppression groups . HCMV was considered as endothelial cells ( EC ) tropism and leukocyte tropism . We hypothesized that HCMV will infect other cell types from human which have not been reported yet . The HCMV released from human MRC-5 was inoculated into eight human primary cells and cell lines , including human dermal fibroblasts ( HDF ) , human embryo-chondrocytes ( O14777 ) , human embryo-myoblasts ( HEM ) , and human embryo-kidney endothelial cell ( P29320 -EC ) , human marrow stromal cell ( HMSC ) . The cell lines were ECV304 , Chung liver cell and L02 . Several detection methods specific for HCMV , in which PCR for HCMV DNA sequences , immunofluorescence for pp65 antigen , Western-blot for gB protein , as well as cytopathic effect observation were conducted at different time post-infection . The results indicated that four cells in our experiment ( HDF , HEM , O14777 and HMSC ) were HCMV-positive . The occurring time of cytopathic effect was different in these four cells . Our experiment found the new tropism and new reservoirs for HCMV .
