N-Acetylaspartate and Q9UD71 levels decrease in the corpus striatum of Huntington 's disease mice . Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is an autosomal dominant condition involving progressive neurodegeneration , primarily the corpus striatum and cerebral cortex . We have used in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( P59665 ) to assess specific neuronal markers in transgenic mice ( R6/1 line ) expressing exon I of the human huntingtin gene with an expanded CAG repeat . Levels of N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , an indicator of healthy neuronal function , were significantly reduced ( 26 % ) in the corpus striatum of HD mice relative to wild-type littermates at 5 months of age . However , levels of cholines and creatine-phosphocreatine were not altered in the HD mice . Expression of dopamine- and DB02527 -regulated phosphoprotein , 32 kDa ( Q9UD71 ) , was assessed by immunohistochemistry in the striatum of HD mice and found to be downregulated by 5 months and , even more dramatically , at 11 months of age . In contrast , expression of calbindin was not significantly decreased in HD mice . Our results suggest that the observed decreases in Q9UD71 and NAA may contribute to aberrant receptor signalling and neuronal dysfunction in HD .
