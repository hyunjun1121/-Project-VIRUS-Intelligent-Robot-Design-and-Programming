Coadministration of acetaminophen and troglitazone : pharmacokinetics and safety . DB00197 , a P37231 agonist , enhances the actions of insulin on muscle and liver . It is metabolized predominantly in the liver to a sulfate conjugate and a quinone metabolite . Acetaminophen also undergoes metabolism by conjugation . This three-way crossover study in 12 healthy male volunteers was conducted to investigate the effects of acetaminophen on the metabolism of troglitazone and vice versa . No statistically or clinically relevant differences in area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity ( AUCinfinity ) were observed for troglitazone , its quinone metabolite , or acetaminophen . A statistically significant decrease in troglitazone sulfate conjugate during administration with acetaminophen was not clinically relevant . No statistically or clinically relevant differences were observed in maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , time to Cmax ( tmax ) , or elimination half-life of troglitazone , its two main metabolites , and acetaminophen or in acetaminophen urinary sulfate excretion , although there was a slight decrease in acetaminophen glucuronide excretion during administration with troglitazone . Adverse events were minor and similar between treatments . These findings suggest that troglitazone and acetaminophen can be coadministered without adverse clinical consequences .
