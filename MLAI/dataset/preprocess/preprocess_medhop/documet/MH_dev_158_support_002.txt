Differential expression of cyclophilin isoforms during keratinocyte differentiation . P62937 , the major intracellular binding protein for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) , was studied in human keratinocytes during differentiation both in vivo and in vitro . Analysis of cyclophilin by gel-filtration radiobinding-assay with tritiated DB00091 showed one specific radioactive peak at 17 kDa . By this technique , the levels of cyclophilin ( mean 55.23 +/- 8.43 pmol/mg protein ) did not significantly differ during keratinocyte differentiation . When the protein extracts from calcium-induced differentiating keratinocytes and normal human skin were analysed by PAGE radiobinding-assay , two specific radioactive DB00091 -binding peaks were detected . The major peak ( RF 0.13 ) was expressed in all samples ( mean 47.32 +/- 17.53 pmol/mg protein ) whereas the minor peak ( RF 0.23 ) was dramatically decreased about 6-fold in abnormally differentiated skin ( psoriasis ) as well as in non-differentiated keratinocytes . At least six [3H] DB00091 -binding isoforms with pI values ranging from 5.58 to 7.75 were detected by isoelectrofocusing autoradio-blotting-assay in normal human skin ; three of them immunoreacted with antibodies to cyclophilin . These results demonstrated the presence of several cyclophilin isoforms in human epidermal cells and an expression which correlated with the differentiation of human keratinocytes both in vivo and in vitro .
