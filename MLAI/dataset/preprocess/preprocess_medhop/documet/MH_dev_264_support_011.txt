Differential effects of P47900 and Q9H244 nucleotide receptors on P27361 / P28482 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling and cell proliferation in serum-deprived and nonstarved glioma P13671 cells . We have previously shown that , in glioma P13671 cells , two nucleotide ADP-sensitive receptors coexist : P47900 , coupled to P98160 and responsible for Ca2+ release , and Q9H244 , negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase . In the present study , we examined the effects of the stimulation of these two receptors on P27361 /2 and P19957 -K activation , and cell proliferation in either serum-deprived or nonstarved P13671 cells . In response to ADP and its analogues , in serum-starved cells , both Q8TCB0 P27361 and Q8NFH3 P28482 were activated in a time-dependent manner , as monitored by Western blot analysis using an antiphospho- Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK antibody . The phosphorylation was reduced both by removal of the extracellular Ca2+ and partially or almost completely by MRS2179 or AR-C69931MX , specific antagonists of the P47900 and Q9H244 receptors , respectively . The inhibitory effect of antagonists was additive . These data indicate the involvement of both receptors , P47900 and Q9H244 , in the P27361 /2 activation , but the Q9H244 receptor contribution predominates . P27361 /2 activity was positively correlated with cell proliferation of cultured glioma P13671 cells . In nonstarved cells , ADP markedly decreased the P19957 -K activity . In contrast , in serum-starved cells , ADP evoked an increase in the P19957 -K activity . Blocking of the P47900 receptor by MRS2179 additionally increased this ADP response . These results suggest that the P47900 receptor has an inhibitory and the Q9H244 receptor a stimulatory effect on P19957 -K signalling pathway . RT-PCR analysis revealed different mRNA expression of both receptors in starved and nonstarved cells . In nonstarved cells , the P47900 receptor mRNA predominates , whereas in serum-deprived cells the expression of Q9H244 mRNA becomes more pronounced .
