Direct attenuation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 expression in human adipose tissue by thiazolidinediones . Adipose tissue produces substantial amounts of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) , an established cardiovascular risk factor . This study evaluated P05121 expression in human adipose tissue in response to thiazolidinediones , insulin sensitising drugs activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . DB00197 , rosiglitazone , and ciglitazone significantly reduced P05121 protein expression in human preadipocytes under basal conditions and after stimulation of the cells with TGF-beta . Pioglitazone had no effect . In human adipocytes all four thiazolidinediones significantly attenuated P05121 expression . Signalling appeared to be mediated via P37231 and effects reflected , at least in part , changes in transcription . Accordingly , patients with insulin resistance may benefit from treatment with thiazolidinediones with respect to diminution of P05121 expression in adipose tissue and consequent potential reduction of cardiovascular risk .
