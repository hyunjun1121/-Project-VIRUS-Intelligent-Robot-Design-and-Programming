Prolonged effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on anterior pituitary hormone release . We examined the chronic ( 72 h ) effects of 30 ng/ml recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha on release of immunoreactive growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) , and DB00024 glycosylation , as assessed by lectin binding , in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells . In cultured cells from adult female rats , P01375 significantly suppressed basal and GH-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) -stimulated GH release . P01375 also suppressed basal PRL release and completely abolished the PRL response to TRH ( 0.1-10 nM ) . Whereas P01375 reduced basal DB00024 release , it significantly enhanced the maximal DB00024 response to TRH . P01375 did not affect the concanavalin A and lentil lectin binding of DB00024 accumulated in the medium during the 4-day culture , but significantly decreased the lentil lectin binding of DB00024 released in response to acute TRH stimulation . P01375 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on stimulated PRL release , but not on GH or DB00024 release . Compared to cell cultures from adult female rats , in anterior pituitary cell cultures from 12-day-old rats the effects of prolonged exposure to P01375 on hormone release were diminished or absent . Pituitary hormone release was unaffected by acute ( 3 h ) exposure to P01375 . These results demonstrate a direct effect of P01375 on anterior pituitary hormone release , which is cell-type specific and age dependent .
