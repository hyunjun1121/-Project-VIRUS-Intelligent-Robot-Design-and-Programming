Lessons from 6 years of P10912 antagonist therapy for acromegaly . DB00082 is a P10912 antagonist and a new agent for the medical management of acromegaly . The clinical efficacy and safety of pegvisomant in the treatment of active acromegaly were demonstrated in a 12-week , placebo-controlled trial of 112 patients . After a washout period , patients were randomized to a fixed dose of pegvisomant ( 10 , 15 or 20 mg/day ) or placebo given by sc injection . Serum P05019 levels were within the normal age-adjusted reference range in 54 , 81 and 89 % of patients in the 10- , 15- and 20-mg/day groups , respectively . The decrease in serum P05019 levels was accompanied by considerable improvement in the signs and symptoms of active acromegaly . This efficacy profile was maintained in a long-term continuation trial , with normalization of serum P05019 at 12 months occurring in 97 % of patients . DB00082 has been well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo . Two patients had elevations in liver function tests that resolved after discontinuing treatment with pegvisomant . During treatment with pegvisomant , liver function tests should be monitored on a regular basis . Two patients had an increase in pituitary tumor volume during pegvisomant therapy ; however , the relationship to pegvisomant therapy was not clear . In 131 patients treated for at least 6 months , there was no increase in mean tumor volume , regardless of whether they underwent previous radiotherapy . DB00082 is an effective new treatment for the management of patients with acromegaly . Longer-term data are needed to confirm the safety profile that has been demonstrated in studies up to 18 months .
