P01375 -related apoptosis inducing ligand ( P50591 ) up-regulates death receptor 5 ( DR5 ) mediated by NFkappaB activation in epithelial derived cell lines . P01375 -related apoptosis inducing ligand ( P50591 /APO-2L ) activates nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) . This activation is regulated by the recruitment of an adaptor protein Fas associating death domain ( Q13158 ) to P50591 death receptors , death receptor 4 ( DR4 , O00220 ) and death receptor 5 ( DR5 O14763 ) . This leads to recruitment of caspase 8 and receptor interacting protein ( RIP ) to the receptor complex . Upon recruitment of caspase 8 and RIP , NFkappaB inducing kinase ( NIK ) becomes activated causing NFkappaB activation . The role of P50591 induced NFkappaB activation in epithelial cells is unknown . Herein we demonstrate that P50591 increases expression of DR5 in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 , MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 epithelial cell lines while DR4 expression remains unchanged . Blockage of NFkappaB activation either by expression of dominant negative IkappaB or treatment with proteasome inhibitor lactacystin eliminates P50591 induced DR5 expression . Expression of Q13158 dominant negative in P29320 293 cells that prevents the recruitment of caspase 8 and RIP to P50591 death receptors also eliminates this increase . By over expression of the p65 subunit of NFkappaB that increases NFkappaB transcriptional activity , DR5 expression was increased compared to vector alone expressing cells . By blocking P50591 induced NFkappaB activation , the sensitivity of cells to undergo P50591 induced apoptosis was significantly decreased . Conversely , the amount of P50591 induced apoptosis was increased in P29320 293 cells over expressing p65 subunit of NFkappaB . Finally blockage of NFkappaB activation eliminates the synergistic apoptotic response of P50591 and etoposide . Thus , P50591 mediated NFkappaB activation increases DR5 expression thereby amplifying the apoptotic response of P50591 in epithelial derived cells .
