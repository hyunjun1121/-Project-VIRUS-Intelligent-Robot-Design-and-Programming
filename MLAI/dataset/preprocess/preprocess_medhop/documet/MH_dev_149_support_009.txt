TGBp3 triggers the unfolded protein response and P63208 -dependent programmed cell death . The Potato virus X ( PVX ) triple gene block protein 3 ( TGBp3 ) , an 8-kDa membrane binding protein , aids virus movement and induces the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) during PVX infection . TGBp3 was expressed from the Tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) genome ( TMV-p3 ) , and we noted the up-regulation of P63208 and several endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) -resident chaperones , including the ER luminal binding protein ( P11021 ) , protein disulphide isomerase ( P07237 ) , calreticulin ( CRT ) and calmodulin ( P62158 ) . Local lesions were seen on leaves inoculated with TMV-p3 , but not TMV or PVX . Such lesions were the result of TGBp3-elicited programmed cell death ( P61457 ) , as shown by an increase in reactive oxygen species , DNA fragmentation and induction of P63208 expression . UPR-related gene expression occurred within 8 h of TMV-p3 inoculation and declined before the onset of P61457 . TGBp3-mediated cell death was suppressed in plants that overexpressed P11021 , indicating that UPR induction by TGBp3 is a pro-survival mechanism . Anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-xl , DB01333 -9 and Op-IAP were expressed in transgenic plants and suppressed N gene-mediated resistance to TMV , but failed to alleviate TGBp3-induced P61457 . However , TGBp3-mediated cell death was reduced in P63208 -silenced Nicotiana benthamiana plants . The combined data suggest that TGBp3 triggers the UPR and elicits P61457 in plants .
