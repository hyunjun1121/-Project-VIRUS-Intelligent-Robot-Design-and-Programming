P55157 inhibitor decreases plasma cholesterol levels in P01130 -deficient WHHL rabbits by lowering the VLDL secretion . To examine whether a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) -inhibitor is effective in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia , we administered ( 2S ) -2-cyclopentyl-2-[4-[(2,4-dimethyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indol-9-yl)methyl]phenyl]-N- [ ( 1S ) -2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl ] ethanamide ( DB04852 ) , a new P55157 inhibitor , to low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -receptor-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic ( WHHL ) rabbits at doses of 3 , 6 , and 12 mg/kg for 4 weeks . In the 12 mg/kg group , the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were decreased by 70 % and 45 % , respectively , and the very low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) secretion rate was decreased by 80 % . The composition of newly secreted VLDL was similar in each group . This suggests that DB04852 diminished the number of VLDL particles secreted from the liver . Although the ratio of vitamin E/LDL was not altered by DB04852 , triglyceride accumulation and a decrease in vitamin E were observed in the liver . In conclusion , an inhibition of VLDL secretion led to a decrease of plasma LDL in WHHL rabbits , and P55157 inhibitors should have hypolipidemic effects against homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia .
