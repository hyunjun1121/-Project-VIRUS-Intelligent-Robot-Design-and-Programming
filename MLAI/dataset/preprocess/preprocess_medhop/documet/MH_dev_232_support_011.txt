DB04901 : a review . IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : A significant number of patients relapse or do not respond to rituximab due to intrinsic or acquired resistance . Hence , mAbs targeting other cell surface antigens on B-cell lymphomas are being studied . P33681 is a glycoprotein expressed on Hodgkin 's lymphoma , mature B-cell lymphomas and immunoeffector cells which may have T-regulatory , in addition to direct antitumor activity . P33681 serves as an attractive target in the continued development of mAbs against lymphoma . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : Preclinical studies with galiximab , an anti- P33681 primatized mAb , have been encouraging and have demonstrated antitumor activity against various B-cell lymphoma models , both as a single agent as well as in combination with rituximab . Data were reviewed from a PubMed literature search from 1975 to 2009 and also included a review of abstracts from published proceedings of annual meetings from the American Society of Hematology and International Conference of Malignant Lymphoma , Lugano . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : Readers will gain a better understanding of mechanisms of action ( both documented and proposed ) of galiximab . An update of currently available clinical data will be presented . TAKE HOME MESSAGE : Data from completed clinical trials are promising and galiximab is being studied in both upfront and relapsed settings with the potential of being incorporated into the future treatment of B-cell lymphoma .
