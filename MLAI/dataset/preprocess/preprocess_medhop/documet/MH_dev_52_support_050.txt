Effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 on retinal endothelial cell glucose transport and proliferation . P01308 -like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) plays important roles in the developing and mature retina and in pathological states characterized by retinal neovascularization , such as diabetic retinopathy . The effects of DB01277 on glucose transport and proliferation and the signal transduction pathways underlying these effects were studied in a primary bovine retinal endothelial cell ( BREC ) culture model . DB01277 stimulated uptake of the glucose analog DB08831 in a dose-dependent manner , with a maximal uptake at 25 ng/mL ( 3.3 nM ) after 24 h . Increased transport occurred in the absence of an increase in total cellular P11166 transcript or protein . DB01277 stimulated activity of both protein kinase C ( PKC ) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase ( P19957 kinase ) , and both pathways were required for DB01277 -mediated BREC glucose transport and thymidine incorporation . Use of a selective inhibitor of the beta isoform of PKC , LY379196 , revealed that DB01277 stimulation of glucose transport was mediated by P05771 ; however , inhibition of P05771 had no effect on BREC proliferation . Taken together , these data suggest that the actions of DB01277 in retinal endothelial cells couple proliferation with delivery of glucose , an essential metabolic substrate . The present studies extend our general understanding of the effects of DB01277 on vital cellular activities within the retina in normal physiology and in pathological states such as diabetic retinopathy .
