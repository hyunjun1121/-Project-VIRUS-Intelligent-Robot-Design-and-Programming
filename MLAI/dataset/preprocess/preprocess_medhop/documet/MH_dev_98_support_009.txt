P14210 plays a key role in insulin resistance-associated compensatory mechanisms . P01308 resistance is present in obesity and in type 2 diabetes and is associated with islet cell hyperplasia and hyperinsulinemia , but the driving forces behind this compensatory mechanism are incompletely understood . Previous data have suggested the involvement of an unknown circulating insulin resistance-related β-cell growth factor . In this context , looking for candidates to be a circulating factor , we realized that hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) is a strong candidate as a link between insulin resistance and increased mass of islets/hyperinsulinemia . Our approach aimed to show a possible cause-effect relationship between increase in circulating P14210 levels and compensatory islet hyperplasia/hyperinsulinemia by showing the strength of the association , whether or not is a dose-dependent response , the temporality , consistency , plausibility , and reversibility of the association . In this regard , our data showed : 1 ) a strong and consistent correlation between P14210 and the compensatory mechanism in three animal models of insulin resistance ; 2 ) P14210 increases β-cell mass in a dose-dependent manner ; 3 ) blocking P14210 shuts down the compensatory mechanisms ; and 4 ) an increase in P14210 levels seems to precede the compensatory response associated with insulin resistance , indicating that these events occur in a sequential mode . Additionally , blockages of P08581 ( DB00134 ) worsen the impaired insulin-induced insulin signaling in liver of diet-induced obesity rats . Overall , our data indicate that P14210 is a growth factor playing a key role in islet mass increase and hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced obesity rats and suggest that the P14210 - DB00134 axis may have a role on insulin signaling in the liver .
