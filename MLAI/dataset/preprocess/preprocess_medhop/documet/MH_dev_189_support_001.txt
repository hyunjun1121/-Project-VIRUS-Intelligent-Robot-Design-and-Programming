Inhibition of c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase activity by DB00619 , a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor . DB00619 ( formerly known as CGP 57148B ) is a known inhibitor of the c-abl , bcr-abl , and platelet-derived growth-factor receptor ( P09619 ) tyrosine kinases . This compound is being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia . We sought to extend the activity profile of DB00619 by testing its ability to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit , a receptor structurally similar to P09619 . We treated a c-kit expressing a human myeloid leukemia cell line , M-07e , with DB00619 before stimulation with Steel factor ( SLF ) . DB00619 inhibited c-kit autophosphorylation , activation of mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase , and activation of Akt without altering total protein levels of c-kit , Q96HU1 kinase , or Akt . The concentration that produced 50 % inhibition for these effects was approximately 100 nmol/L . DB00619 also significantly decreased SLF-dependent growth of M-07e cells in a dose-dependent manner and blocked the antiapoptotic activity of SLF . In contrast , the compound had no effect on Q96HU1 kinase activation or cellular proliferation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor . We also tested the activity of DB00619 in a human mast cell leukemia cell line ( HMC-1 ) , which has an activated mutant form of c-kit . DB00619 had a more potent inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of this mutant receptor than it did on ligand-dependent activation of the wild-type receptor . These findings show that DB00619 selectively inhibits c-kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream activation of target proteins involved in cellular proliferation and survival . This compound may be useful in treating cancers associated with increased c-kit kinase activity .
