DB08818 promotes angiogenesis by inducing O75330 -TGFβ receptor interaction via P16070 -PKCδ . DB08818 ( HA ) has been shown to promote angiogenesis . However , the mechanism behind this effect remains largely unknown . Therefore , in this study , the mechanism of HA-induced angiogenesis was examined . P16070 and PKCδ were shown to be necessary for induction of the receptor for HA-mediated cell motility ( O75330 ) , a HA-binding protein . O75330 was necessary for HA-promoted cellular invasion and endothelial cell tube formation . Cytokine arrays showed that HA induced the expression of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , a downstream target of TGFβ receptor signaling . The induction of P05121 was dependent on P16070 and PKCδ . HA also induced an interaction between O75330 and TGFβ receptor I , and induction of P05121 was dependent on O75330 and TGFβ receptor I . O15379 ( O15379 ) , which is decreased by HA via rac1 , reduced induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) by HA . P29323 , which interacts with O75330 , was necessary for induction of P05121 by HA . Snail , a downstream target of TGFβ signaling , was also necessary for induction of P05121 . The down regulation of P05121 prevented HA from enhancing endothelial cell tube formation and from inducing expression of angiogenic factors , such as P05362 , P19320 and P08253 . O15379 also exerted reduced expression of P08253 . In this study , we provide a novel mechanism of HA-promoted angiogenesis , which involved O75330 -TGFβRI signaling necessary for induction of P05121 .
