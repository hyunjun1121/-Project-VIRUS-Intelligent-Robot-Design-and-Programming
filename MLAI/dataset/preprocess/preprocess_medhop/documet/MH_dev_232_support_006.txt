IL-20 activates human lymphatic endothelial cells causing cell signalling and tube formation . IL-20 is an arteriogenic cytokine that remodels collateral networks in vivo , and plays a role in cellular organization . Here , we investigate its role in lymphangiogenesis using a lymphatic endothelial cell line , hTERT-HDLEC , which expresses the lymphatic markers Q9Y5Y7 and podoplanin . Upon stimulation of hTERT-HDLEC with IL-20 , we found an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration , in Akt and P29474 phosphorylations as well as in perinuclear NO production . We found that P29474 phosphorylation and NO synthesis are highly dependent on the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway . We also found an IL-20 induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and P42345 , and using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and P42345 complex inhibitor rapamycin we demonstrated the importance of these signalling pathways in IL-20-mediated proliferation . IL-20 triggered actin polymerization and morphological changes resulting in elongated cell structures , and in matrigels , IL-20 caused tube formations of hTERT-HDLEC in a PI3K- and P42345 dependent way . In a sprouting assay we found that IL-20 caused cell migration within 24 h at a rate comparable to P49767 , and this migration could be inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin . These data show that IL-20 activates cell signalling resulting in lymphangiogenic processes including migration , proliferation and tube formation . Thus , IL-20 is a cytokine that has the potential of activating or modulating the formation of lymphatic vessels .
