Pleiotropic effect of pyridoxamine on diabetic complications via P16671 expression in KK-Ay/Ta mice . AIM : Pyridoxamine inhibits the development of diabetic complications . P16671 is a receptor/transporter which binds fatty acids of lipoproteins . The objective of the present study was to examine the pleiotropic effects of pyridoxamine , especially P16671 expression in KK-A(y)/Ta mice with type 2 diabetic nephropathy . METHODS : KK-A(y)/Ta mice were divided into 2 groups as follows : pyridoxamine treatment group and a tap water group as controls . The urinary P10323 , fasting serum insulin , TG and lipoprotein subclasses were measured as biochemical parameters . The renal expressions of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry . P16671 mRNA expressions in kidney and adipose tissue were also evaluated using real-time PCR . RESULTS : Pyridoxamine decreased levels of urinary P10323 , serum TG , especially VLDL and fasting serum insulin . MDA accumulation in the pyridoxamine treated group was significantly lower than those in the non-treatment group . The P16671 accumulation and mRNA expressions in kidney and adipose tissue in the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the non-treatment group . CONCLUSIONS : It appears that pyridoxamine ameliorated lipid peroxidation and insulin resistance in KK-A(y)/Ta mice . This pleiotropic effect of pyridoxamine was related to P16671 expression in the kidney and adipose tissue .
