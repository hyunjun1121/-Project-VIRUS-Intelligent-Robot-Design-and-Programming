DB00877 -induced autophagy aggravates pathology and weakness in a mouse model of P55072 -associated myopathy . Pathological phenotypes in inclusion body myopathy ( IBM ) associated with Paget disease of the bone ( PDB ) , frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) ( IBMPFD/ P35858 ) include defective autophagosome and endosome maturation that result in vacuolation , weakness and muscle atrophy . The link between autophagy and IBMPFD/ P35858 pathobiology has been poorly understood . We examined the AKT- O43524 and P42345 pathways to characterize the regulation of autophagy in IBMPFD/ P35858 mouse muscle . We identified a defect in P42345 signaling that results in enhanced autophagosome biogenesis . Modulating P42345 signaling may therefore be a viable therapeutic target in IBMPFD/ P35858 .
