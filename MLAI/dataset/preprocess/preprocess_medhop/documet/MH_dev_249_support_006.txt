PPARgamma activation abolishes LDL-induced proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells via SOD-mediated down-regulation of superoxide . Native LDL would be a mitogenic and chemotactic stimulus of VSMC proliferation and differentiation in the atherosclerotic lesion where endothelial disruption occurred . In previous studies , our group investigated the molecular mechanisms by which LDL induces P10145 production and by which PPARalpha activation abolishes LDL effects in human aortic SMCs ( hAoSMCs ) . Herein is the first report of PPARgamma activation by troglitazone ( TG ) exerting its inhibitory effects on LDL-induced cell proliferation via generation not of H(2)O(2) , but of O2(.-) , and the subsequent activation of Erk1/2 in hAoSMCs . Moreover , in this study TG abolished the LDL-accelerated G(1)-S progression to control levels via down-regulation of active cyclinD1/ P11802 and cyclinE/ P24941 complexes and up-regulation of P38936 (Cip1) expression . TG exerted its anti-proliferative effects through the up-regulation of basal superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) expression . This data suggests that the regulation of O2(.-) is located at the crossroads between LDL signaling and cell proliferation .
