Gestational exposure to the P35869 agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induces BRCA-1 promoter hypermethylation and reduces BRCA-1 expression in mammary tissue of rat offspring : preventive effects of resveratrol . Studies with murine models suggest that maternal exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon receptor ( P35869 ) agonists may impair mammary gland differentiation and increase the susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis in offspring . However , the molecular mechanisms responsible for these perturbations remain largely unknown . Previously , we reported that the P35869 agonists 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) induced CpG methylation of the breast cancer-1 ( BRCA-1 ) gene and reduced BRCA-1 expression in breast cancer cell lines . Based on the information both the human and rat BRCA-1 genes harbor xenobiotic responsive elements ( XRE = 5'-GCGTG-3' ) , which are binding targets for the P35869 , we extended our studies to the analysis of offspring of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats treated during gestation with TCDD alone or in combination with the dietary P35869 antagonist resveratrol ( Res ) . We report that the in utero exposure to TCDD increased the number of terminal end buds ( TEB ) and reduced BRCA-1 expression in mammary tissue of offspring . The treatment with TCDD induced occupancy of the BRCA-1 promoter by DNA methyltransferase-1 ( P26358 -1 ) , CpG methylation of the BRCA-1 promoter , and expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 ( P11802 ) . These changes were partially overridden by pre-exposure to Res , which stimulated the expression of the A9YTQ3 ( A9YTQ3 ) and its recruitment to the BRCA-1 gene . These findings point to maternal exposure to P35869 agonists as a risk factor for breast cancer in offspring through epigenetic inhibition of BRCA-1 expression , whereas dietary antagonists of the P35869 may exert protective effects .
