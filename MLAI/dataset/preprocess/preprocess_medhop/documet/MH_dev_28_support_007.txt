Protein indicators for HaCaT cell damage induced by UVB irradiation . UVB ( 290-320 nm ) is one major risk factor of skin diseases in human . In order to provide potential protein molecules in skin cell damage and skin diseases induced by UVB irradiation , the differentially expressed proteins in human keratinocytes cell HaCaT by UVB irradiation were screened by two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis ( 2D DIGE ) combined to high performance liquid chromatography-nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-nESI-MS/MS ) . 31 protein spots were found differentially expressed with statistical significance ( p < 0.05 ) . Sixteen and 15 protein spots were observed up-regulated and down-regulated in UVB-irradiated HaCaT , respectively . Twenty-eight unique proteins were identified by searching the MS/MS data against NCBInr database through TurboSequest Bioworks software . Among the identified 28 UVB irradiation responding protein indicators , only laminin receptor 1 ( P08865 ) , calmodulin ( P62158 ) , cathepsin D ( P07339 ) and peroxiredoxin ( Q06830 ) proteins have been reported associated with skin burn and wound healing , keratinocytes proliferation and migration and epidermal barrier repairing . Most of these targets were for the first time revealed to be associated with skin cell damage induced by UVB irradiation . Function and bioinformatics analyses of the identified protein candidates were also performed using PANTHER analysis with the aid of DAVID platform . The current work provides potential protein indicators for skin cell damage from UVB irradiation .
