DB05007 -- a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor : results of a phase II study in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed after responding to treatment with either gefitinib or erlotinib . INTRODUCTION : Although patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose tumors harbor epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) activating mutations commonly experience significant regressions when treated with erlotinib or gefitinib , they uniformly develop resistance to these agents . The secondary P00533 T790M mutation is found in 50 % of patients with acquired resistance . Herein , we studied DB05007 , an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases , including P00533 , P35968 , P04626 , and EphB4 , in NSCLC patients known or suspected of having tumors harboring T790M . METHODS : Eligible patients included those with relapsed or recurrent advanced NSCLC who progressed after â‰¥12 weeks of stable disease or response to erlotinib or gefitinib and/or those patients with a documented P00533 T790M . DB05007 300 mg was administered once daily . The primary end point was objective response rate . Pretreatment plasma samples were collected for mutation testing of circulating tumor DNA . RESULTS : Forty-one patients were enrolled ; 33 were evaluable for efficacy . One partial response was observed ( response rate 3 % and 90 % confidence interval , 0 % to 14 % ) . Of patients whose tumors harbored T790M , 67 % ( 8/12 ) had progression of disease as best response compared with 14 % ( 3/21 ) of those without this mutation . Plasma samples from 40 patients were available for mutation testing , 14 ( 35 % ) of which were found to have P00533 mutations . CONCLUSIONS : The 3 % response rate observed did not meet the prespecified threshold to recommend further study of DB05007 in patients who develop acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib . Patients with T790M had a significantly worse progression-free survival .
