Mutation of the calmodulin binding motif IQ of the L-type Ca(v)1.2 Ca2+ channel to EQ induces dilated cardiomyopathy and death . Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling ( EC coupling ) links the electrical excitation of the cell membrane to the mechanical contractile machinery of the heart . DB01373 channels are major players of EC coupling and are regulated by voltage and Ca(2+)/calmodulin ( P62158 ) . P62158 binds to the IQ motif located in the C terminus of the Ca(v)1.2 channel and induces Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation ( CDI ) and facilitation ( P05231 ) . Mutation of DB00167 to DB00142 ( Ile1624Glu ) in the IQ motif abolished regulation of the channel by CDI and P05231 . Here , we addressed the physiological consequences of such a mutation in the heart . Murine hearts expressing the Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) mutation were generated in adult heterozygous mice through inactivation of the floxed WT Ca(v)1.2( Q401N2 ) allele by tamoxifen-induced cardiac-specific activation of the MerCreMer Cre recombinase . Within 10 days after the first tamoxifen injection these mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) accompanied by apoptosis of cardiac myocytes ( CM ) and fibrosis . In Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts , the activity of phospho- P62158 kinase II and phospho-MAPK was increased . CMs expressed reduced levels of Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel protein and I(Ca) . The Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) channel showed " CDI " kinetics . Despite a lower sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content , cellular contractility and global Ca(2+) transients remained unchanged because the EC coupling gain was up-regulated by an increased neuroendocrine activity . Treatment of mice with metoprolol and captopril reduced DCM in Ca(v)1.2(I1624E) hearts at day 10 . We conclude that mutation of the IQ motif to IE leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and death .
