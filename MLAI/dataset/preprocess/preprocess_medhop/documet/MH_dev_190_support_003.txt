Inhibitory effects of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist on basal and epidermal growth factor-induced cell proliferation and metastasis-associated properties in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a potent P01148 agonist , [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 on the basal and P01133 -induced cell proliferation and the metastasis-associated properties in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma . [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 time-dependently inhibited the basal and P01133 -stimulated growth of A431 cancer cells . It is assumed that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cellular proteins is highly related to cell growth . This study demonstrates that [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 decreased the basal and P01133 -induced total cellular kinase activity , particularly the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins including the P00533 . In contrast , [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 did not cause detectable changes in basal and P01133 -stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of A431 cellular proteins . The inhibitory effect of [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 on A431 cell proliferation was associated with apoptosis as evidenced by the cell morphology and DNA integrity ( ladder pattern ) , the expression of interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme ( ICE ) and activation of caspase . Furthermore , P01133 could rescue the remaining attached A431 cells following [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 treatment for 48 hr , which suggests that limited exposure to [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 did not channel all cells to irreversible apoptotic process . We also determined the effects of [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 on metastasis-associated properties in A431 cells . [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 reduced both basal and P01133 -stimulated secretion of P14780 and P08253 . In addition , [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 suppressed the basal and P01133 -induced invasive activity of A431 cells based on an in vitro invasion assay . In conclusion , this study indicates that [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 may act partly through activating tyrosine phosphatase activity to inhibit cell proliferation and the metastasis-associated properties of A431 cancer cells . Our work suggests that [D- DB00150 (6)] P01148 may be therapeutically useful in limiting the tumor growth and metastasis of some neoplasms .
