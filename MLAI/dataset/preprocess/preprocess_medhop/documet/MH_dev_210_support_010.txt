TagSNP evaluation for the association of 42 inflammation loci and vascular disease : evidence of P05231 , P02675 , P09917 , P25963 , and P24394 loci effects . Inflammatory markers have consistently been associated with vascular disease . Evidence of genetic polymorphisms in inflammatory loci that predict severe carotid artery disease ( CAAD ) would suggest that this relationship is not secondary to other correlated factors , but related to inflammation itself . We examined the full common genetic variation in 42 inflammatory loci for prediction of severe CAAD versus ultrasound proven controls using a tagSNP approach . For selected loci , monocyte RNA levels were contrasted in subjects with and without CAAD . We confirm the association of P05231 (-174) , P02675 ( -455 ) , and P09917 with CAAD and show that multiple P09917 SNPs independently predict CAAD . We provide evidence for previously unreported associations of SNPs in P24394 , P25963 , and P00747 with CAAD , and weaker evidence for associations with P09919 , Q13651 , and P19320 . The P25963 and Q13651 expression levels significantly differed between subjects with CAAD and controls . These results support a role for genetic variation related to inflammation in CAAD and a causal role for specific gene products .
