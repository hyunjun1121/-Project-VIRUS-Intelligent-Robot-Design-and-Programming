Expression , purification , and biological characterization of the amino-terminal fragment of urokinase in Pichia pastoris . DB00013 ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis . Targeting the excessive activation of this system as well as the proliferation of the tumor vascular endothelial cell would be expected to prevent tumor neovasculature and halt the tumor development . In this regard , the amino-terminal fragment ( P39905 ) of urokinase has been confirmed as effective to inhibit the proliferation , migration , and invasiveness of cancer cells via interrupting the interaction of uPA and Q03405 . Previous studies indicated that P39905 expressed in Escherichia coli was mainly contained in inclusion bodies and also lacked posttranslational modifications . In this study , the biologically active and soluble P39905 was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris . The recombinant protein was purified to be homogenous and confirmed to be biologically active . The yield of the active P39905 was about 30 mg/l of the P. pastoris culture medium . The recombinant P39905 ( rATF ) could efficiently inhibit angiogenesis , endothelial cell migration , and tumor cell invasion in vitro . Furthermore , it could inhibit in vivo xenograft tumor growth and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice significantly by competing with uPA for binding to cell surfaces . Therefore , P. pastoris is a highly efficient and cost-effective expression system for large-scale production of biologically active rATFs for potential therapeutic application .
