Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists induce apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes by caspase-3 activation . The platelet integrin glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa , which mediates platelet aggregation , has been the target for novel antiplatelet agents , the P08514 /IIIa antagonists . Several P08514 /IIIa antagonists have been developed based on the peptide RGDS present in adhesion proteins , including the principle ligand fibrinogen . The apoptosis enzyme , procaspase-3 , contains an RGD-recognition sequence and is activated by RGDS . We examined the effects of RGDS and several P08514 /IIIa antagonists on cell death and procaspase-3 activation in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes . These antagonists do not recognize rat integrins , yet RGDS , orbofiban , and xemilofiban induced dose-dependent apoptosis and procaspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes over 72 h , particularly under hypoxic conditions . Scrambled peptide , the monoclonal antibody 7E3 or integrelin ( a peptide containing a KGD sequence ) , had little or no effect . Immunoprecipitation of procaspase-3 followed by treatment with the compounds showed that procaspase-3 was activated directly by RGDS , orbofiban , xemilofiban , and by monoclonal DB00054 , the latter demonstrating that compounds must enter cells to induce apoptosis through caspase activation . DB00063 had no effect . Binding studies with (3)H-SC52012B , a P08514 /IIIa antagonist analogue of orbofiban , showed no specific binding to cardiomyocytes , but the radioligand accumulated intracellularly over 72 h . (3)H-SC52012B also bound directly to human recombinant caspase-3 ( K(d) , 59 +/- 2 nm ) , and this was prevented by orbofiban , xemilofiban , and the monoclonal DB00054 but not by integrelin . Finally confocal microscopy showed that RGDS co-localized with caspase-3 inside the cell . These data show that RGDS and its mimetics induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by direct activation of procaspase-3 .
