Interpretation of point-of-care INR results in patients treated with dabigatran . BACKGROUND : Point-of-care devices for measurement of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) are commonly used to monitor therapy and maintain therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists . DB06695 , a new oral , reversible direct thrombin inhibitor approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation does not require routine coagulation monitoring . However , case reports have identified falsely elevated point-of-care INR levels in patients treated with dabigatran using one of these devices ( Hemochron ) . This in vitro study was designed to verify this issue . METHODS : We compared INR levels in whole blood and plasma using a Hemochron Jr . Signature+ point-of-care device ( International Technidyne Corporation , Edison , NJ ) with routine laboratory monitoring , using blood from healthy volunteers that was spiked with increasing concentrations of dabigatran . RESULTS : P00734 time and INR levels were increased about 2- to 4-fold with the point-of-care device compared with laboratory measures across the plasma dabigatran concentration range 50-1400 ng/mL . At plasma concentrations of dabigatran likely to be observed in patients , at a dose of 150 mg twice daily ( 60-275 ng/mL ) , whole blood point-of-care INR values increased from 1.7 to 4.0 , versus 1.1 to 1.5 measured with the laboratory coagulometer . Similar differences in prothrombin time were observed in plasma samples . CONCLUSIONS : INR levels in patients taking dabigatran are substantially higher using a Hemochron Jr. point-of-care device compared with laboratory values . We discourage the use of these devices specifically , as well as the use of the INR in general , for measuring the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran .
