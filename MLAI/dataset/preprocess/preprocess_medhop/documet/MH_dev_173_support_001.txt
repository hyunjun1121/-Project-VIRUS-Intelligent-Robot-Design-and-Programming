Quantification of raf antisense oligonucleotide ( rafAON ) in biological matrices by LC-MS/MS to support pharmacokinetics of a liposome-entrapped rafAON formulation . An LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify an antisense oligonucleotide against P04049 expression ( rafAON ) in monkey and mouse plasma and in mouse tissue homogenates from animals dosed with a liposome-entrapped rafAON easy-to-use formulation ( DB04973 -ETU ) intended for use as an antineoplastic agent . RafAON was extracted from mouse and monkey plasma using solid-phase extraction . Tissues were homogenized and sample cleanup was achieved by protein precipitation . RafAON and the internal standard ( IS ) were separated on a Hamilton PRP-1 column and quantified by tandem mass spectrometry using an electrospray source in negative ion mode . The total run time was 4.0 min . The peak areas of two rafAON transitions were summed and plotted against the peak area of an IS transition to generate the standard curve . In monkey plasma the linear range was 50-10,000 ng/mL , and in mouse plasma it was 25-5000 ng/mL . The lower limit of quantification was 500 ng/mL ( 10 microg/g tissue ) in heart , kidney , liver , lung and spleen homogenates , and the standard curve was linear up to 10,000 ng/mL . Accuracy , precision and stability were evaluated and found to be acceptable in all three matrices . The assay was used to support pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies of DB04973 -ETU in mice and monkeys .
