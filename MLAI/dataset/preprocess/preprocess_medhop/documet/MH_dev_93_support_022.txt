P35372 and P20813 gene variants as risk factors in methadone-related deaths . DB00333 is a medication valued for its effectiveness in the treatment of heroin addiction ; however , many fatal poisonings associated with its use have been reported over the years . We have examined the association between P20813 and micro-opioid receptor ( P35372 ) gene variations and apparent susceptibility to methadone poisoning . Genomic DNA was extracted from postmortem whole blood of 40 individuals whose deaths were attributed to methadone poisoning . The presence of P20813 *4,*9 , and *6 alleles and the P35372 A118G variant was determined by SNP genotyping . P20813 *4 , *9 , and *6 alleles were found to be associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood ( P < or = 0.05 ) . P35372 A118G was also associated with higher postmortem methadone concentrations in blood but not to a level of statistical significance ( P = 0.39 ) . In these methadone-related deaths , P35372 118GA was associated with higher postmortem benzodiazepine concentrations ( P = 0.04 ) , a finding not associated with morphine-related deaths . The risk of a methadone-related fatality during treatment may be evaluated in part by screening for P20813 *6 and A118G .
