Evaluation of hearing loss with auditory brainstem responses in the early and late period of bacterial meningitis in children . The hearing function of 50 children with bacterial meningitis was evaluated at the second and 10th days , and eight weeks after admission with auditory brain system responses ( Q12979 ) to investigate whether meningitis causes hearing loss . Normal values were obtained in all tests from both ears of 24 patients ( 48 per cent ) . Twelve patients ( 24 per cent ) had temporary , and seven ( 14 per cent ) patients had persistent mild degree hearing loss . Severe hearing loss was detected bilaterally in five ( 10 per cent ) patients and unilaterally in two ( four per cent ) patients . Patients , with other complications such as subdural effusion , convulsion , brain oedema and paralysis were found to have a higher incidence of hearing loss . We observed that patients treated with dexamethasone had 7.7 per cent persistent hearing loss , 11.6 per cent mild hearing loss , 34.6 per cent transient hearing loss , but in the group who did not receive dexamethasone there was 19.2 per cent persistent hearing loss , 15.3 per cent mild hearing loss and 11.6 per cent transient hearing loss . There were other significant differences between the two groups in restoration of normal body temperature , the P04141 /plasma glucose concentration ratio was elevated , P04141 ( cerebro-spinal fluid ) protein concentration was decreased and the cell count in the P04141 was decreased in the dexamethasone group , significantly more than the group who were not receiving dexamethasone . The hearing loss tended to be more frequent among younger children .
