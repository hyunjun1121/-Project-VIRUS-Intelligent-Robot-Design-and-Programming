DB03419 incorporation into genomic DNA does not predict toxicity caused by chemotherapeutic inhibition of thymidylate synthase . P04818 ( TS ) is an important target of several chemotherapeutic agents , including DB00544 and raltitrexed ( DB00293 ) . During TS inhibition , TTP levels decrease with a subsequent increase in dUTP . DB03419 incorporated into the genome is removed by base excision repair ( BER ) . Thus , BER initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase ( P13051 ) activity has been hypothesized to influence the toxicity induced by TS inhibitors . In this study we created a human cell line expressing the Ugi protein inhibitor of P13051 family of UDGs , which reduces cellular P13051 activity by at least 45-fold . Genomic uracil incorporation was directly measured by mass spectrometry following treatment with TS inhibitors . Genomic uracil levels were increased over 4-fold following TS inhibition in the Ugi-expressing cells , but did not detectably increase in P13051 proficient cells . Despite the difference in genomic uracil levels , there was no difference in toxicity between the P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells to folate or nucleotide-based inhibitors of TS . Cell cycle analysis showed that P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells arrested in early S-phase and resumed replication progression during recovery from RTX treatment almost identically . The induction of gamma- P16104 was measured following TS inhibition as a measure of whether uracil excision promoted DNA double strand break formation during S-phase arrest . Although gamma- P16104 was detectable following TS inhibition , there was no difference between P13051 proficient and P13051 -inhibited cells . We therefore conclude that uracil excision initiated by P13051 does not adequately explain the toxicity caused by TS inhibition in this model .
