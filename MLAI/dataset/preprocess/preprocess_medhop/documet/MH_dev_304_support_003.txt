Biological profile of oestrogen receptor positive primary breast cancers in the elderly and response to primary endocrine therapy . P11511 inhibitors have been shown to be superior to Tamoxifen in several settings . It is unclear whether this superiority extends to their use as primary endocrine therapy in elderly patients with early operable primary breast cancer . Biological characteristics of the tumours may aid in selecting the most suitable agent . Primary endocrine therapy with DB01217 in 64 women > 70 years with oestrogen receptor alpha-positive ( ERalpha+ ) breast cancer was compared to that in 84 treated with Tamoxifen during the same period . Biomarkers were assessed by immunohistochemistry on diagnostic core biopsies . There was no significant difference between the two groups ( DB01217 vs Tamoxifen ) in terms of clinical benefit rates at 6 months ( 97 % vs 100 % ) or median progression free survival ( 16.5 vs 22.5 months ) . There were no withdrawals due to adverse events from DB01217 , compared to four with Tamoxifen . 46 % , 99 % , 8 % and 5 % of all patients were positive for progesterone receptor , ERbeta2 , P04626 and P00533 , respectively , and 64 % of patients had a moderate Ki-67 index . Positive P04626 status ( 18 vs 21 months , p=0.003 ) and moderate Ki-67 index ( 17.5 vs 23 months , p=0.042 ) were associated with significantly shorter progression free survival . Results thus far show that primary endocrine therapy with DB01217 in elderly patients with early operable ERalpha+ breast cancer is similar to Tamoxifen in terms of efficacy , but appears to be associated with less adverse events leading to withdrawals . In this population , ERalpha+ breast cancer also appears to have a less aggressive biological profile favouring better hormone sensitivity .
