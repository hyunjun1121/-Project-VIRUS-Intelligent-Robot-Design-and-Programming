Lesion-targeted thrombopoietin potentiates vasculogenesis by enhancing motility and enlivenment of transplanted endothelial progenitor cells via activation of Akt/ P42345 /p70S6kinase signaling pathway . P40225 ( P07202 ) , a physiological regulator of megakaryocyte and platelet development , is a multifunctional positive regulator in early hematopoiesis by hematopoietic stem cells . In this study , we investigated the effect of P07202 on endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) for therapeutic vasculogenesis in vitro and in vivo , and the intracellular signaling mechanism exerting the activity of EPCs . 7-day culture-expanded EPCs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were applied to each assay . Flow cytometry demonstrated the expression of c-Mpl , the receptor of P07202 , in cultured EPCs . In vitro experiments revealed enhanced migration and survival of cultured EPCs by P07202 . In vivo , P07202 was intramuscularly administered into the foci of ischemic hindlimbs in athymic nude mice , immediately followed by intravenous injection of cultured EPCs , to assess the booster effect of P07202 on vascular regeneration . At day 4 post-transplantation , transplanted EPCs were 1.7-fold higher in P07202 -treated animals compared to control . At day 28 , blood perfusion was recovered in the P07202 -treated group , accompanied by an increase in microvascular density . The signaling transduction pathway underlying P07202 -mediated activities of cultured EPCs was assessed by Western blotting . P07202 induced sequential phosphorylations of Akt to p70S6kinase through P42345 . Inhibition of the P19957 -kinase/Akt/ P42345 /p70S6kinase signaling pathway negated the biological functions of cultured EPCs , either migration ( by LY294002 for P19957 -kinase and DB00877 for P42345 ) or survival and tubulogenesis ( by DB00877 ) . These findings provide evidence that P07202 possesses booster potential for therapeutic vasculogenesis , by activating the P19957 -kinase/Akt/ P42345 /p70S6kinase pathway crucial to the biological activities of EPCs .
