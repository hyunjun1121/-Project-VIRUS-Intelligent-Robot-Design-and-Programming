DB00065 in experimental alkali burns of the oesophagus in the rat . BACKGROUND : We aimed to investigate the efficacy of infliximab , a chimeric P01375 antibody , in the prevention of fibrosis in an experimental alkaline burn of the oesophagus in the rat . METHODS : Thirty-two Wistar albino rats divided into four experimental groups . Caustic oesophageal burn was induced by applying 37.5 % NaOH to the distal oesophagus . DB00065 was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg via the intraperitoneal route . Group A ( sham ) animals were uninjured , group B had untreated oesophageal burns , group C had oesophageal burns treated with a single dose of infliximab on the first day , and Group D had oesophageal burns treated with infliximab on the first and 14th days . Efficacy of the treatment was assessed on the 28th-day by measuring stenosis index of the oesophagus and histopathological damage score , and biochemically by determining tissue hydroxyproline content . RESULTS : There was no significant difference between the Group B and the infliximab treated Groups C and D in means of tissue hydroxyproline content and histopathological damage scores . Stenosis index was not significantly different between the Group B , Group C , and Group D . CONCLUSION : Anti- P01375 treatment with infliximab does not ameliorate the degree of fibrosis in alkali burns of the oesophagus in the rat . Further evaluation of inflammatory and immunological events leading to stricture in alkaline oesophageal burns may provide new perspectives for the treatment of alkaline oesophageal burns .
