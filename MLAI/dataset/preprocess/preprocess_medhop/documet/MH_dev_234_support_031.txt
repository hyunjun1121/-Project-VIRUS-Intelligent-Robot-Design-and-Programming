Targeted inactivation of Q92769 restores p16INK4a activity and exerts antitumor effects on human gastric cancer . Aberrant regulation of histone deacetylase 2 ( Q92769 ) was reported for gastric cancers . However , responsive cancer genes in disease onset and progression are less understood . Q92769 expression was studied by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting . The functional consequences of Q92769 knockdown on cell-cycle regulation , programmed cell death , and gene target identification was investigated by flow cytometry , Western blotting , electron microscopy , anchorage-independent colony formation , and cell migration assay and by whole-genome microarray . Therapeutic efficacy of Q92769 knockdown was determined in nude mice with small hairpin expressing human gastric cancer cells . Epigenetic regulation of p16(INK4a) was studied by methylation-specific PCR and chromatin-IP to evidence Q92769 or acetylated-histone-H4 binding at gene specific promoter sequences . Q92769 gene and protein expression was significantly upregulated in different histopathologic grades of human gastric cancers and cancer cell lines . Q92769 inactivation significantly reduced cell motility , cell invasion , clonal expansion , and tumor growth . Q92769 knockdown-induced G(1)-S cell cycle arrest and restored activity of p16(INK4a) and the proapoptotic factors . This treatment caused PARP cleavage and hypophosphorylation of the Rb-protein , repressed cyclinD1 , P11802 , and Bcl-2 expression and induced autophagic phenotype , that is , LC3B-II conversion . Some gastric tumors and cancer cells displayed p16(INK4a) promoter hypermethylation but treatment with 5-aza-deoxycitidine restored activity . With others the methylation status was unchanged . Here , chromatin-IP evidenced Q92769 binding . Nonetheless , expression of p16(INK4a) was restored by Q92769 knockdown with notable histone-H4-acetylation , as determined by chromatin-IP . Thus , p16(INK4a) is regulated by Q92769 . Q92769 is a bona fide target for novel molecular therapies in gastric cancers .
