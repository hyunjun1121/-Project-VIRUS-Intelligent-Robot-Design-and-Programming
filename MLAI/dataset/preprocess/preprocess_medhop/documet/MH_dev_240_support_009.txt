Uptake of particulate vaccine adjuvants by dendritic cells activates the Q96P20 inflammasome . Many currently used and candidate vaccine adjuvants are particulate in nature , but their mechanism of action is not well understood . Here , we show that particulate adjuvants , including biodegradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) and polystyrene microparticles , dramatically enhance secretion of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) by dendritic cells ( DCs ) . The ability of particulates to promote IL-1beta secretion and caspase 1 activation required particle uptake by DCs and Q96P20 . Uptake of microparticles induced lysosomal damage , whereas particle-mediated enhancement of IL-1beta secretion required phagosomal acidification and the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B , suggesting a role for lysosomal damage in inflammasome activation . Although the presence of a Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonist was required to induce IL-1beta production in vitro , injection of the adjuvants in the absence of TLR agonists induced IL-1beta production at the injection site , indicating that endogenous factors can synergize with particulates to promote inflammasome activation . The enhancement of antigen-specific antibody production by P00747 microparticles was independent of Q96P20 . However , the ability of P00747 microparticles to promote antigen-specific P05231 production by T cells and the recruitment and activation of a population of CD11b(+)Gr1(-) cells required Q96P20 . Our data demonstrate that uptake of microparticulate adjuvants by DCs activates the Q96P20 inflammasome , and this contributes to their enhancing effects on innate and antigen-specific cellular immunity .
