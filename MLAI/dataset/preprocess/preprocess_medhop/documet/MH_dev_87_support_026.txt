A real time quantitative PCR analysis and correlation of P23219 and P35354 enzymes in inflamed dental pulps following administration of three different NSAIDs . Dental pain is encountered daily by clinicians . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) commonly used for pain management are traditionally cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors , and more recently selective P35354 inhibitors . This study was designed to identify and quantify P23219 and P35354 gene expression level in inflamed rat molar pulps after administration of three NSAIDs : DB00482 , Vioxx , and DB01050 . Fifty male Wistar rats had their first and second molar pulps exposed and sealed with Cavit for 4 days . Rats were randomly divided into the three drug groups and two control groups . RNA was isolated from the rat pulps . Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction assay , a relatively new PCR technique , was used to quantify P23219 and P35354 mRNA . Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant differences in P23219 and P35354 levels among the drug groups . However , Vioxx and DB01050 significantly reduced P35354 expression levels compared to inflamed ( positive control ) pulps ( p < 0.05 ) .
