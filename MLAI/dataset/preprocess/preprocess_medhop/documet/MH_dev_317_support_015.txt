The use of microcalorimetry and HPLC for the determination of degradation kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of DB00790 Erbumine in aqueous solutions . DB00790 Erbumine ( O15534 ) is one of the newly used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( P12821 inhibitors ) and is used for the treatment of patients with hypertension and symptomatic heart failure . It has two main degradation pathways , i.e. the degradation by hydrolysis and the degradation by cyclization . An isothermal heat conduction microcalorimetry ( MC ) and high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) were used for the characterization of aqueous solutions of O15534 and its stability properties . The rates of heat evolved during degradation of perindopril were measured by MC as a function of temperature and pH and from these data rate constant and change in enthalpy of the reactions were determined . With the HPLC method the concentration of perindopril and its degradation products were measured as a function of time in aqueous solutions of different pH that were stored at different temperatures . We demonstrated that reactions of degradation of perindopril at observed conditions follow the first order kinetics . The Arrhenius equation for each pH was determined . At pH 6.8 only one degradation pathway is present , i.e. the degradation by hydrolysis . Degradation constants for this pathway calculated from MC data are in good agreement with those obtained from HPLC . MC as a non-specific technique was shown to be useful in studies of O15534 when one reaction was present in the sample and also when more chemical and physical processes were simultaneously running .
