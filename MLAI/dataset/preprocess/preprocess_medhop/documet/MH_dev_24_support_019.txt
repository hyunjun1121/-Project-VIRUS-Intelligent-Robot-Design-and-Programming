Molecular components and functions of the endocannabinoid system in mouse prefrontal cortex . BACKGROUND : Cannabinoids have deleterious effects on prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) -mediated functions and multiple evidences link the endogenous cannabinoid ( endocannabinoid ) system , cannabis use and schizophrenia , a disease in which P27918 functions are altered . Nonetheless , the molecular composition and the physiological functions of the endocannabinoid system in the P27918 are unknown . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Here , using electron microscopy we found that key proteins involved in endocannabinoid signaling are expressed in layers v/vi of the mouse prelimbic area of the P27918 : presynaptic cannabinoid P21554 receptors ( CB1R ) faced postsynaptic P41594 while diacylglycerol lipase alpha ( Q9Y4D2 ) , the enzyme generating the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol ( 2-AG ) was expressed in the same dendritic processes as P41594 . Activation of presynaptic CB1R strongly inhibited evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents . Prolonged synaptic stimulation at 10Hz induced a profound long-term depression ( LTD ) of layers V/VI excitatory inputs . The endocannabinoid -LTD was presynaptically expressed and depended on the activation of postsynaptic P41594 , phospholipase C and a rise in postsynaptic Ca(2+) as predicted from the localization of the different components of the endocannabinoid system . Blocking the degradation of 2-AG ( with Q76M96 602 ) but not of anandamide ( with Q76M96 597 ) converted subthreshold tetanus to LTD-inducing ones . Moreover , inhibiting the synthesis of 2-AG with DB01083 , blocked endocannabinoid-mediated LTD . All together , our data show that 2-AG mediates LTD at these synapses . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Our data show that the endocannabinoid -retrograde signaling plays a prominent role in long-term synaptic plasticity at the excitatory synapses of the P27918 . Alterations of endocannabinoid -mediated synaptic plasticity may participate to the etiology of P27918 -related pathologies .
