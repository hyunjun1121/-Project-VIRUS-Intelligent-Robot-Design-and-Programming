Altered apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils in P14780 -deficient mice is due to lower expression and activity of caspase-3 . Matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( P14780 ) is a Zn(2+)-dependent endopeptidase that degrades some of the components of basement membranes and extracellular matrix and thus participates in leukocyte infiltration during inflammation . In a model of zymosan peritonitis , neutrophil infiltration in MMP-deficient ( P14780 (-/-) ) mice was significantly weaker at the time of their maximal influx in wild-type mice ( 6h ) . However , during the late stages of peritonitis ( 24h ) an extended accumulation of neutrophils was observed in P14780 (-/-)versus the wild-type mice . Recently , we reported that the ratio of apoptosis of inflammatory leukocytes is impaired in P14780 (-/-) mice during late peritonitis and the process depends on P23219 -driven PGE(2) . Here we scrutinized the alterations in apoptotic mechanisms by comparisons between P14780 (-/-) and the wild-type mice . Altered apoptosis occurred only during late ( 24h ) peritonitis and concerned only neutrophils , and not macrophages , mast cells or lymphocytes . Furthermore , expression and activity of caspases was altered in P14780 (-/-) animals , delayed for caspase-8 and -9 , and decreased in the case of caspase-3 . Also the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 proteins was changed in P14780 (-/-) mice . These changes , and in particular the impaired neutrophil apoptosis and weaker caspase-3 activity , were restored by the selective P23219 inhibition . We conclude that in mice lacking P14780 the enhanced P23219 -PGE(2) decreases caspase-3 expression and activity leading to impaired apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils resulting in abnormal accumulation of the cells at the inflammatory focus . The data also reinforce the notion that P14780 is a key enzyme in neutrophil biology .
