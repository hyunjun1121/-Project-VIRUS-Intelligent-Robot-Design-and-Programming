Serotonin P08908 receptor binding potential declines with age as measured by [11C]WAY-100635 and PET . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) and [11C]WAY-100635 were used to examine the effect of age on serotonin-1A ( P08908 ) receptor binding potential ( BP ) in 19 healthy subjects . Regions of interest ( ROI ) were drawn on the co-registered magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) in orbitofrontal ( OFC ) , dorsolateral prefrontal ( DLPFC ) , anterior cingulate ( ACC ) , lateral ( LTC ) , and mediotemporal ( P04629 ) , parietal , occipital and cerebellar cortex , and the raphe nuclei . BP values were calculated using a simplified reference tissue method . In addition , a voxelwise analysis was performed using SPM99 . Voxelwise analysis revealed a significant global decrease of 5-HT(1A) BP with age ( set level < .001 ) . ROI analysis revealed significant age-related 5-HT(1A) BP decreases in DLPFC ( r = -0.56 ) , ACC ( r = -0.44 ) , OFC ( r = -0.42 ) , LTC ( r = -0.40 ) , parietal ( r = -0.65 ) , and occipital cortex ( r = -0.43 ) , but not in P04629 or raphe nuclei . Overall , cortical 5-HT(1A) BP declined by approximately 10 % per decade , except for the P04629 , where we did not find a significant age effect . Hence , careful age matching may be recommended for future studies using PET and [11C]WAY-100635 to examine P08908 receptors .
