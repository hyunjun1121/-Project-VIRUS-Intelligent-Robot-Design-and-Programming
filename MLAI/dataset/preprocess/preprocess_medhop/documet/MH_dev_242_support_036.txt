The genomic clone P08908 which resembles a beta-adrenergic receptor sequence encodes the P08908 receptor . The recent cloning of the complementary DNAs and/or genes for several receptors linked to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins including the adrenergic receptors ( alpha 1 , alpha 2A , alpha 2B , beta 1 , beta 2 ) , several subtypes of the muscarinic cholinergic receptors , and the visual ' receptor ' rhodopsin has revealed considerable similarity in the primary structure of these proteins . In addition , all of these proteins contain seven putative transmembrane alpha-helices . We have previously described a genomic clone , P08908 , isolated by cross-hybridization at reduced stringency with a full length beta 2-adrenergic receptor probe . This clone contains an intronless gene which , because of its striking sequence resemblance to the adrenergic receptors , is presumed to encode a G-protein-coupled receptor . Previous attempts to identify this putative receptor by expression studies have failed . We now report that the protein product of the genomic clone , Q96NT5 , transiently expressed in monkey kidney cells has all the typical ligand-binding characteristics of the 5-hydroxytryptamine ( P08908 ) receptor .
