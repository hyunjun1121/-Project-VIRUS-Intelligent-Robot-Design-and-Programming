Frequency , risk factors , prognosis , and genetic polymorphism of the cyclooxygenase-1 gene for aspirin resistance in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular disease . BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is an important cause of mortality in elderly patients worldwide . DB00945 resistance has been well reported in CVD . OBJECTIVE : The frequency , risk factors , prognosis , and genetic polymorphism of the cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) gene for aspirin resistance have not been reported in elderly patients with CVD . We therefore undertook this study to evaluate these associations among elderly Chinese patients with CVD . METHODS : Four hundred thirty-one elderly Chinese patients with CVD receiving daily aspirin therapy ( â‰¥75 mg ) over 1 month were enrolled . Platelet aggregation was measured by light transmission aggregometry ( P01374 ) and thromboelastography platelet mapping assay ( TEG ) using arachidonic acid ( AA ) as a stimulus . The median follow-up was 1.8 years . RESULTS : After the median follow-up , aspirin-resistant patients were at an increased risk of the composite endpoint compared to nonresistant patients by LTAAA + TEGAA ( 23.7 vs. 9.2 % , p = 0.025 ) . Additionally , Cox proportional hazards regression modeling demonstrated that aspirin resistance and cerebrovascular disease were associated with major adverse long-term outcomes ( HR for aspirin resistance = 2.31 , 95 % CI 1.11-4.81 , p = 0.026 ) . The variant G-allele of P23219 rs1330344 ( -1676 A/G ) significantly increased the risk of aspirin resistance defined by LTAAA + TEGAA ( OR = 1.82 , 95 % CI 1.13- 2.92 , p = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB00945 resistance , evaluated by LTAAA + TEGAA , is associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in elderly Chinese patients with CVD . The variant G-allele of P23219 rs1330344 is significantly associated with aspirin resistance defined by LTAAA + TEGAA .
