P36888 -mutant allelic burden and clinical status are predictive of response to P36888 inhibitors in AML . We examined 6 different P07333 -like tyrosine kinase-3 ( P36888 ) inhibitors ( lestaurtinib , midostaurin , DB05213 , KW-2449 , sorafenib , and sunitinib ) for potency against mutant and wild-type P36888 , as well as for cytotoxic effect against a series of primary blast samples obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) harboring internal tandem duplication ( P36888 /ITD ) mutations . We found that inhibition of P36888 autophosphorylation in a P36888 /ITD specimen does not always induce cell death , suggesting that some P36888 /ITD AML may not be addicted to P36888 signaling . Relapsed samples and samples with a high mutant allelic burden were more likely to be responsive to cytotoxicity from P36888 inhibition compared with the samples obtained at diagnosis or those with a low mutant allelic burden . These P36888 inhibitors varied to a considerable degree in their selectivity for P36888 , and this selectivity influenced the cytotoxic effect . These results have important implications for the potential therapeutic use of P36888 inhibitors in that patients with newly diagnosed P36888 -mutant AML might be less likely to respond clinically to highly selective P36888 inhibition .
