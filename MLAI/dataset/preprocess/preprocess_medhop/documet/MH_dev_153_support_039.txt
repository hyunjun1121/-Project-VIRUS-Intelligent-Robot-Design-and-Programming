P35568 regulation in health and disease . The global incidence of diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates . Estimates suggest there are currently 150 million people with diabetes and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years . Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95 % of all cases and is characterized in part by impaired sensitivity to insulin or ' insulin resistance ' . Defects in the insulin signalling pathways underpin this resistance . In the current article we discuss the regulation of P01308 Receptor Substrate-1 ( P35568 ) , a protein that plays a pivotal role in insulin signalling and whose function is impaired in subjects with insulin resistance . Coordination of P35568 function is multi-faceted , involving phosphorylation of P35568 at multiple serine/threonine residues . This controls many aspects of P35568 , including its interaction with the insulin receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation , as well as its subcellular distribution and targeting for degradation by the proteasome . Such tight control ensures appropriate transduction and attenuation of the insulin signal , thereby regulating insulin action in healthy individuals . Emerging evidence indicates that ' diabetogenic factors ' associated with insulin resistance , such as TNFalpha and elevated circulating fatty acids , impact on insulin signalling at the level of P35568 serine/threonine phosphorylation . The expression and/or activity of several kinases , such as O15111 beta ( IKKbeta ) and salt-induced kinase 2 ( Q9H0K1 ) , and the phosphorylation of P35568 at key sites , such as Ser307 and Ser789 , are increased in states of insulin resistance . Identifying the pathways by which such factors activate these and other kinases , and defining the precise roles of specific serine/ threonine phosphorylation events in P35568 regulation , represent important goals which may eventually provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention .
