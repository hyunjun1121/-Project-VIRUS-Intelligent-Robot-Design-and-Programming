Tumour necrosis factor alpha and use of infliximab . Safety during pregnancy . QUESTION : A 27-year-old patient of mine with rheumatoid arthritis has been treated with infliximab for the last 5 years . She is planning her first pregnancy . How should I advise her regarding use of infliximab during pregnancy , bearing in mind that infliximab substantially improved her medical condition ? ANSWER : DB00065 ( Remicade ) has not been tested in pregnant animals because it does not interact with non-human tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha . Several case reports describing women who used infliximab during pregnancy do not suggest a strong association with adverse pregnancy outcomes . More studies are required to determine infliximab 's safety during pregnancy .
