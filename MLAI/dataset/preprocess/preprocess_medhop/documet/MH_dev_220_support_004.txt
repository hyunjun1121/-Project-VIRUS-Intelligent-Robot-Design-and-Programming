MAPK induces P29972 expression in astrocytes following injury . P55087 ( P55087 ) is the principle water channel and the primary route for water transport across astrocytic membranes . P55087 co-localizes with Kir4.1 channels at astrocytic endfeet , and it has been suggested that these channels cooperate in K(+) and water homeostasis . In response to injury , two additional aquaporins , P29972 and AQP9 , can be detected in astrocytes , yet neither is found in cultured astrocytes , and therefore their contribution to astrocyte water uptake and biology is poorly investigated . In this study , we used a cortical stab wound assay to demonstrate an upregulation of P29972 following injury in reactive glia . We were able to mimic such injury in astrocytic cultures and show that P29972 expression is induced within 16 h following injury in vitro . This induction could be blocked by inhibition of Q02750 /2 using U0126 , and suggests that P29972 is specifically induced in reactive astrocytes via the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway .
