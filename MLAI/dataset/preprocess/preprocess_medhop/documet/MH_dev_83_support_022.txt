Docking studies on NSAID/ P35354 isozyme complexes using contact statistics analysis . The selective inhibition of P35354 isozymes should lead to a new generation of NSAIDs with significantly reduced side effects ; e.g. celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) . To obtain inhibitors with higher selectivity it has become essential to gain additional insight into the details of the interactions between P36551 isozymes-and NSAIDs . Although X-ray structures of P35354 complexed with a small number of ligands are available , experimental data are missing for two well-known selective P35354 inhibitors ( rofecoxib and nimesulide ) and docking results reported are controversial . We use a combination of a traditional docking procedure with a new computational tool ( Contact Statistics analysis ) that identifies the best orientation among a number of solutions to shed some light on this topic .
