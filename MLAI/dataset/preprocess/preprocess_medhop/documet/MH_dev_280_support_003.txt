Pharmacological characterization of 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( DB05225 ) , a novel selective P09917 -activating protein inhibitor that reduces acute and chronic inflammation . Leukotrienes ( LTs ) are proinflammatory lipid mediators synthesized by the conversion of arachidonic acid ( AA ) to P01374 (4) by the enzyme P09917 ( P09917 ) in the presence of P09917 -activating protein ( P20292 ) . 3-[3-tert-Butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( DB05225 ) is a novel selective P20292 inhibitor in development for the treatment of respiratory conditions such as asthma . In a rat ex vivo whole-blood calcium ionophore-induced Q06643 (4) assay , DB05225 ( administered orally at 1 mg/kg ) displayed > 50 % inhibition for up to 6 h with a calculated EC(50) of approximately 60 nM . When rat lung was challenged in vivo with calcium ionophore , DB05225 inhibited Q06643 (4) and cysteinyl leukotriene ( CysLT ) production with ED(50) values of 0.8 and 1 mg/kg , respectively . In this model , the EC(50) derived from plasma DB05225 was approximately 330 nM for inhibition of both Q06643 (4) and CysLT . In an acute inflammation setting , DB05225 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of Q06643 (4) , CysLT , and plasma protein extravasation induced by peritoneal zymosan injection . In a model of chronic lung inflammation using ovalbumin-primed and challenged BALB/c mice , DB05225 reduced the concentrations of eosinophil peroxidase , CysLTs , and interleukin-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . Finally , DB05225 increased survival time in mice exposed to a lethal intravenous injection of platelet-activating factor . In summary , DB05225 is a novel , potent and selective P20292 inhibitor that has excellent pharmacodynamic properties in vivo and is effective in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation and in a model of lethal shock .
