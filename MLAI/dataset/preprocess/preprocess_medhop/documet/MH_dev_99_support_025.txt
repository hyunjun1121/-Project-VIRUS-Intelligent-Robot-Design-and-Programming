hsBAFF enhances activity of NK cells by regulation of P01730 (+) T lymphocyte function . B cell activating factor belonging to the P01375 family ( Q9Y275 , also called Q9Y275 , Q9Y275 , THANK , or zTNF4 ) is an important survival factor for B cells , and is able to regulate T cell activation . Recently , we have demonstrated that human soluble Q9Y275 ( hsBAFF ) potently elevates NK cell activity of murine splenic cells in vivo . In this study , we further show that hsBAFF markedly enhanced NK cell activity of in vitro mouse splenic cells . Purified NK cell activities treated with hsBAFF in the presence of P60568 or P01579 , but not with hsBAFF alone were obviously elevated . hsBAFF strongly increased the activity of NK cells co-incubated with mixed T and B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes alone , but not with B lymphocytes alone . We also found that culture supernatants , from mixed T and B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes alone , but not from B lymphocytes alone post-hsBAFF treatment , effectively increased NK cell activity , and noticed that P60568 and P01579 levels significantly increased in the culture supernatants of hsBAFF-treated T lymphocytes . Of importance , we pinpointed that hsBAFF elicited robust population of P01730 (+) T lymphocytes in vitro , and further demonstrated that hsBAFF induced significantly high P60568 and P01579 secretion of P01730 (+) T lymphocytes . These findings indicate that hsBAFF results in the elevation of NK cell activity by regulation of P01730 (+) T lymphocytes contributing to P60568 and P01579 generation .
