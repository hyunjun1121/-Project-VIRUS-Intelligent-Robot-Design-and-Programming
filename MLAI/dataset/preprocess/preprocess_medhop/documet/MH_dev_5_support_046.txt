Prevalence of insomnia and associated factors in South Korea . INTRODUCTION : In Western countries , insomnia is associated with daytime impaired functioning , as well as physical and psychiatric illnesses . However , little information exists on insomnia in Asian countries . This study investigates the prevalence and correlates of insomnia in the general population of South Korea . METHODS : A representative sample of the South Korean general population composed of 3719 noninstitutionalized individuals aged 15 years or older were interviewed by telephone using the Sleep-EVAL system . The participation rate was 91.4 % . The interviews covered sleep habits , sleep symptomatology , physical and psychiatric illnesses . DSM-IV sleep and psychiatric disorder diagnoses were also assessed . RESULTS : Insomnia symptoms occurring at least three nights per week were reported by 17.0 % of the sample ; difficulty initiating sleep ( Q8IX12 ) was mentioned by 4.0 % of the sample , difficulty maintaining sleep ( DMS ) by 11.5 % , early morning awakenings ( P15941 ) by 1.8 % , and nonrestorative sleep ( NRS ) by 4.7 % of the sample . DSM-IV insomnia disorder diagnoses were found in 5 % of the sample . Over 50 % of subjects with insomnia symptoms reported important daytime consequences and another 20 % reported mild or moderate consequences . However , the proportion of insomnia subjects seeking medical help for their sleep problems was very low ( 6.8 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : As in Western countries , insomnia is widespread in South Korea , affecting nearly one in five individuals . Many of them would benefit from medical help ; however , few insomnia subjects are consulting for this problem . An educational effort is needed for both the general population and the physicians .
