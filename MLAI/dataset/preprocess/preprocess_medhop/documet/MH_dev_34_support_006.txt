Molecular physiology of glucagon-like peptide-1 insulin secretagogue action in pancreatic β cells . P01308 secretion from pancreatic β cells is stimulated by glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) , a blood glucose-lowering hormone that is released from enteroendocrine L cells of the distal intestine after the ingestion of a meal . P0C6A0 mimetics ( e.g. , DB01276 ) and P0C6A0 analogs ( e.g. , DB06655 ) activate the β cell P43220 ( P43220 ) , and these compounds stimulate insulin secretion while also lowering levels of blood glucose in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . An additional option for the treatment of T2DM involves the administration of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ( DPP-IV ) inhibitors ( e.g. , Januvia , DB04876 ) . These compounds slow metabolic degradation of intestinally released P0C6A0 , thereby raising post-prandial levels of circulating P0C6A0 substantially . Investigational compounds that stimulate P0C6A0 secretion also exist , and in this regard a noteworthy advance is the demonstration that small molecule Q8TDV5 agonists ( e.g. , AR231453 ) stimulate L cell P0C6A0 secretion while also directly stimulating β cell insulin release . In this review , we summarize what is currently known concerning the signal transduction properties of the β cell P43220 as they relate to insulin secretion . Emphasized are the cyclic AMP , protein kinase A , and Epac2-mediated actions of P0C6A0 to regulate DB00171 -sensitive K⁺ channels , voltage-dependent K⁺ channels , O94759 cation channels , intracellular Ca⁺ release channels , and Ca⁺-dependent exocytosis . We also discuss new evidence that provides a conceptual framework with which to understand why P43220 agonists are less likely to induce hypoglycemia when they are administered for the treatment of T2DM .
