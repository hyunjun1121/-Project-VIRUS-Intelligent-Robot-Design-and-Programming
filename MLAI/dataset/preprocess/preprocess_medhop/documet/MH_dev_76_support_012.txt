The calcium-sensing receptor -- a driver of colon cell differentiation . Dietary Ca(2+) reduces colon cell proliferation and carcinogenesis , but it becomes ineffective or even tumor-promoting during carcinogenesis . It appears that Ca(2+) and the colon cell P41180 together brake the massive cell production in normal colon crypts . The rapid proliferation of the transit-amplifying ( TA ) progeny of the colon stem cells at the bases of the crypts is driven by the " Wnt " signaling mechanism that stimulates proliferogenic genes and prevents apoptogenesis . It appears that TA cell cycling stops and terminal differentiation starts when the cells reach a higher level in the crypt where there is enough external Ca(2+) to stimulate the expression of CaSRs , the signals from which stimulate the expression of P12830 . At this point the P25054 ( adenomatous polyposis coli ) protein appears and some of it enters the nucleus . There it removes the apoptogenesis shield and stops the beta-cateninTcf-4 complex from driving further TA cell proliferation by releasing beta-catenin from the nucleus , and delivering it to cytoplasmic APCaxinGSK-3beta complexes for ultimate proteasomal destruction . Cytoplasmic beta-catenin is prevented from returning to the nucleus by destruction in APCaxinGSK-3beta complexes or locked by the emerging P12830 into adherens junctions which link the cell to proliferatively shut-down functioning cells with P25054 -dependent cytoskeletons moving up and out of the crypt . A common first step in colon carcinogenesis is the loss of functional P25054 which results in the retention of proliferogenic nuclear beta-cateninTcf-4 . This drives the eventual appearance of mutation accumulating , apoptosis-resistant clones the proliferation of which can not be inhibited by external Ca(2+) because of P41180 -disabling gene mutations .
