G- P04141 increases secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by human lung cancer cells . We reported previously that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) can promote the invasion of human lung cancer cell lines in vitro . However , the exact mechanism of its stimulatory effect on invasion remains to be elucidated . In the present study we mainly focused our attention on the components of the plasminogen activation system in human lung cancer cell lines , because of the central role that plasminogen activators play in regulating extracellular proteolysis . We showed that G- P04141 induced a dose-dependent increase in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) activity in the conditioned medium of a PC-9 lung cancer cell line . When the amounts of uPA activity were quantitated by densitometry , we found that even at a concentration of 0.01 microg/ml , G- P04141 had a stimulatory effect on the uPA release , while high concentrations caused a 3.6-fold increase at a maximum concentration of 1 microg/ml . A Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium confirmed the findings observed in a zymographic analysis . The observed increase in uPA protein was paralleled by a significant increase in the uPA mRNA levels after treatment with DB00099 . However , our experiments failed to identify any alteration in the plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) secretion caused by DB00099 . In addition , we also found the expression of Q99062 by PC-9 cells , suggesting the possible pathway activated by DB00099 .
