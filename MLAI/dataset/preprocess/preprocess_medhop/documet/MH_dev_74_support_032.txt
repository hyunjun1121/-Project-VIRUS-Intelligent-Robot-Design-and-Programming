Self-assembly of P29320 cell-secreted ApoE particles resembles ApoE enrichment of lipoproteins as a ligand for the P01130 -related protein . Recent studies have shown that the lipidation and assembly state of apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) determine receptor recognition and amyloid-beta peptide ( Abeta ) binding . We previously demonstrated that apoE secreted by P29320 cells stably expressing apoE3 or apoE4 ( P29320 -apoE ) binds Abeta and inhibits Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by an isoform-specific process that requires apoE receptors . Here we characterized the structure of P29320 -apoE assemblies and determined their receptor binding specificity . By chromatography , P29320 -apoE elutes in high molecular mass fractions and is the size of plasma HDL , consistent with a multiprotein assembly . No lipid was associated with these apoE assemblies . Several methods for analyzing receptor binding indicate that P29320 -apoE is a ligand for low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) but not the P01130 . This suggests that self-assembly of apoE may induce a functional conformation necessary for binding to Q14764 . Our results indicate that , in addition to lipid content , the assembly state of apoE influences Abeta binding and receptor recognition .
