What 's in the pipeline ? New immunosuppressive drugs in transplantation . In the pipeline , there are a number of novel immunosuppressive drugs in preclinical development or in early clinical trials . The major target of new agents are cell-surface molecules important in immune cell interactions ( especially the costimulatory pathway ) , signaling pathways that activate T cells , T-cell proliferation and trafficking and recruitment of immune cells responsible for rejection . The most promising biologic agents include a humanized anti-CD11a ( anti-LFA1 ) , humanized anti- P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 , a second-generation DB01281 ( DB06681 ) and a humanized antibody to anti- P08575 RB . Inhibitors of T-cell activation and signaling are still in preclinical development . The most interesting inhibitors of T-cell proliferation include inhibitors of the Janus protein tyrosine kinase , P52333 , and FK778 , a leflunomide analog . Chemokines play an important role in rejection by virtue of their critical role as regulator of trafficking and activation of lymphocytes . Early trials of FTY720 , a synthetic small molecule with functional homology to sphingosine-1 phosphate leading to lymphocyte sequestration , appear very promising ; however , enthusiasm for this drug is mitigated by its potential cardiac side-effects . Antagonists to several chemokine receptors , including P32246 , P49682 and P51681 , have been shown to be effective in experimental transplantation and are likely to be considered for clinical development .
