Human bronchial smooth muscle cells express adenylyl cyclase isoforms 2 , 4 , and 6 in distinct membrane microdomains . Adenylyl cyclases ( AC ) are important regulators of airway smooth muscle function , because β-adrenergic receptor ( AR ) agonists stimulate AC activity and increase airway diameter . We assessed expression of AC isoforms in human bronchial smooth muscle cells ( hBSMC ) . Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses detected expression of AC2 , AC4 , and AC6 . DB02587 -stimulated AC activity in membranes from hBSMC displayed Ca(2+)-inhibited and G(βγ)-stimulated AC activity , consistent with expression of AC6 , AC2 , and AC4 . DB01064 -stimulated AC activity was inhibited by Ca(2+) but unaltered by G(βγ) , whereas butaprost-stimulated AC activity was stimulated by G(βγ) but unaffected by Ca(2+) addition . Using sucrose density centrifugation to isolate lipid raft fractions , we found that only AC6 localized in lipid raft fractions , whereas AC2 and AC4 localized in nonraft fractions . Immunoisolation of caveolae using caveolin-1 antibodies yielded Ca(2+)-inhibited AC activity ( consistent with AC6 expression ) , whereas the nonprecipitated material displayed G(βγ)-stimulated AC activity ( consistent with expression of AC2 and/or AC4 ) . Overexpression of AC6 enhanced DB02527 production in response to isoproterenol and beraprost but did not increase responses to prostaglandin E(2) or butaprost . β(2)AR , but not prostanoid EP(2) or EP(4) receptors , colocalized with O95622 /6 in lipid raft fractions . Thus , particular G protein-coupled receptors couple to discreet AC isoforms based , in part , on their colocalization in membrane microdomains . These different DB02527 signaling compartments in airway smooth muscle cells are responsive to different hormones and neurotransmitters and can be regulated by different coincident signals such as Ca(2+) and G(βγ) .
