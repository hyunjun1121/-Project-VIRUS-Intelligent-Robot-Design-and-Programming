Prevention of acute and chronic allograft rejection by a novel retinoic acid receptor-alpha-selective agonist . To investigate the involvement of retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -alpha in allograft rejection , we investigated the effect of a novel selective agonist to the receptor , ER-38925 , in a mouse cardiac allograft model . Prophylactic treatment with ER-38925 inhibited the acute rejection of the mouse cardiac allograft ( BALB/c --> C3H/HeN ) at 0.3 and 3 mg/kg , and its effect was enhanced in combination with tacrolimus . In this model , ER-38925 remarkably inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction and alloantigen-stimulated production of cytokines , i.e. P60568 , IL-12 and P01579 . In the chronic rejection model , combined treatment with tacrolimus and ER-38925 reduced the grade and incidence of arteriosclerosis in the cardiac allografts significantly more potently than tacrolimus monotherapy . ER-38925 inhibited the proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated in vitro , presumably through the induction of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , p27(kip-1) . Those results provide a rationale for using P10276 agonists as immunosuppressants in human organ transplantation .
