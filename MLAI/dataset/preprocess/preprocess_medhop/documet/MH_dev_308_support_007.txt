No stress response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in parturient rats : lack of involvement of brain oxytocin . During parturition , the basal activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis of Wistar rats is strongly attenuated , whereas the oxytocin system is activated . We investigated the secretory responses of the Q9Y251 axis and oxytocin to exposure to a mild emotional stressor ( airpuff ) comparing virgin female , d 22 pregnant , and parturient rats . Furthermore , as the brain oxytocin system is activated in parturition and oxytocin has been shown to inhibit Q9Y251 axis responses in virgin rats , the role of brain oxytocin in the regulation of stress responses during parturition was investigated by intracerebroventricular administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist before stressor exposure ( 0.75 micro g/5 micro l ) . In virgin female rats , exposure to airpuff increased DB01285 ( 2.5 +/- 0.34-fold ) and corticosterone ( 5.1 +/- 2.3-fold ) secretion , but in late pregnancy and parturition , the stress-induced increase in DB01285 ( pregnancy : 1.9 +/- 0.41-fold ; parturition : 1.3 +/- 0.13-fold ) and corticosterone secretion ( parturition : 1.8 +/- 0.40-fold ) were strongly attenuated . DB00107 secretion remained unchanged in response to airpuff in both virgin and parturient rats despite higher overall plasma concentrations in the latter . P30559 blockade in the brain elevated basal and stress-induced DB01285 secretion in virgin but not pregnant or parturient rats and had no effect on oxytocin secretion either in virgin or parturient rats . We conclude that the reactivity of the Q9Y251 axis to external stressors is strongly attenuated during parturition , and this can not be disinhibited by blocking the receptor-mediated action of brain oxytocin .
