Regulatory effect of nerve growth factor in alpha9beta1 integrin-dependent progression of glioblastoma . In the present study we described the role of alpha9beta1 integrin in glioblastoma progression following its interaction with nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) . The level of expression of alpha9beta1 on astrocytomas is correlated with increased grade of this brain tumor and is highest on glioblastoma , whereas normal astrocytes do not express this integrin . Two glioblastoma cell lines , LN229 and LN18 , that are alpha9beta1 integrin positive and negative , respectively , were used for alpha9beta1 integrin-dependent P01138 -induced tumor progression . P01138 was a significant promoter of promigratory and pro-proliferative activities of glioblastoma cells through direct interaction with alpha9beta1 integrin and activation of MAPK Erk1/2 pathway . The level of P01138 increases approximately threefold in the most malignant glioma tissue when compared with normal brain . This increase is related to secretion of P01138 by tumor cells . Specific inhibitors of alpha9beta1 integrin or gene silencing inhibited P01138 -induced proliferation of LN229 cell line to the level shown by LN18 cells . VLO5 promoted alpha9beta1-dependent programmed cell death by induction of intrinsic apoptosis pathway in cancer cells . LN229 cells were rescued from proapoptotic effect of VLO5 by the presence of P01138 . This disintegrin significantly inhibited tumor growth induced by implantation of LN229 cells to the chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) of quail embryonic model , and this inhibitory effect was significantly abolished by the presence of P01138 . alpha9beta1 integrin appears to be an interesting target for blocking the progression of malignant gliomas , especially in light of the stimulatory effect of P01138 on the development of these tumors and its ability to transfer proapoptotic signals in cancer cells .
