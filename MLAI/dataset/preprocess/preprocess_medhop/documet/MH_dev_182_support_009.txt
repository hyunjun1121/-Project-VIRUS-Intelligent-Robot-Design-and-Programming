Dexamethasone inhibits interleukin-1β-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in cochlear cells . OBJECTIVES : To investigate the effect of interleukin ( IL ) -1β on matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 expression in cochlea and regulation of IL-1β-mediated P14780 expression by dexamethasone and the molecular and signaling mechanisms involved . METHODS : House ear institute-organ of Corti 1 ( HEI-OC1 ) cells were used and exposed to IL-1β with/without dexamethasone . P04150 antagonist , DB00834 , was used to see the role of dexamethasone . PD98059 ( an extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ ERKs ] inhibitor ) , SB203580 ( a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases [ MAPK ] inhibitor ) , SP600125 ( a c-Jun N-terminal kinase [ JNK ] inhibitor ) were also used to see the role of MAPKs signaling pathway(s) in IL-1β-induced P14780 expression in HEI-OC1 cells . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and gelatin zymography were used to measure mRNA expression level of P14780 and activity of P14780 , respectively . RESULTS : Treatment with IL-1β-induced the expression of P14780 in a dose- and time-dependent manner . IL-1β ( 1 ng/mL ) -induced P14780 expression was inhibited by dexamethasone . Interestingly , p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB203580 , significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced P14780 mRNA and P14780 activity . However , inhibition of JNKs and ERKs had no effect on the IL-1β-induced P14780 expression . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β strongly induces P14780 expression via activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in HEI-OC1 cells and the induction was inhibited by dexamethasone .
