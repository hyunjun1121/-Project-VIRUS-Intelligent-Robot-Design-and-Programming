Differential selectivity of insulin secretagogues : mechanisms , clinical implications , and drug interactions . The sulphonylurea receptor ( Q09428 ) subunits of K( DB00171 ) channels are the targets for several classes of therapeutic drugs . Sulphonylureas close K( DB00171 ) channels in pancreatic beta-cells and are used to stimulate insulin release in type 2 diabetes , whereas the K( DB00171 ) channel opener nicorandil acts as an antianginal agent by opening K( DB00171 ) channels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle . The predominant type of Q09428 varies between tissues : Q09428 in beta-cells , SUR2A in cardiac muscle , and SUR2B in smooth muscle . Sulphonylureas and related drugs exhibit differences in tissue specificity , as the drugs interact to varying degrees with different types of Q09428 . DB01120 and tolbutamide are beta-cell selective and reversible . DB00222 , glibenclamide , and repaglinide , however , inhibit cardiac and smooth muscle K( DB00171 ) channels in addition to those in beta-cells and are only slowly reversible . Similar properties have been observed by recording K( DB00171 ) channel activity in intact cells and in Xenopus oocytes expressing cloned K( DB00171 ) channel subunits . While K( DB00171 ) channels in cardiac and smooth muscle are largely closed under physiological conditions ( but open during ischaemia ) , they are activated by antianginal agents such as nicorandil . Under these conditions , they may be inhibited by sulphonylureas that block SUR2-type K( DB00171 ) channels ( e.g. , glibenclamide ) . Care should , therefore , be taken when choosing a sulphonylurea if potential interactions with cardiac and smooth muscle K( DB00171 ) channels are to be avoided .
