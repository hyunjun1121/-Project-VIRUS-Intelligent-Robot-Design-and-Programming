DB11582 suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 and cancer cells through inhibition of inflammatory pathways : a new use for an old drug . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Most patients with cancer die not because of the tumour in the primary site , but because it has spread to other sites . Common tumours , such as breast , multiple myeloma , and prostate tumours , frequently metastasize to the bone . To search for an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss , we investigated the effect of thiocolchicoside , a semi-synthetic colchicoside derived from the plant Gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant , on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand ( O14788 ) and tumour cells . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : We used RAW 264.7 ( murine macrophage ) cells , a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis , and evaluated the effect of thiocolchicoside on O14788 -induced NF-κB signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by tumour cells . KEY RESULTS : DB11582 suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 , and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells . Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway was responsible for this effect since the colchicoside inhibited O14788 -induced NF-κB activation , activation of IκB kinase ( IKK ) and suppressed inhibitor of NF-κBα ( IκBα ) phosphorylation and degradation , an inhibitor of NF-κB . Furthermore , an inhibitor of the IκBα kinase γ or NF-κB essential modulator , the regulatory component of the IKK complex , demonstrated that the NF-κB signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Together , these data suggest that thiocolchicoside significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by O14788 and tumour cells via the NF-κB signalling pathway . Thus , thiocolchicoside , a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat muscle pain , may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss .
