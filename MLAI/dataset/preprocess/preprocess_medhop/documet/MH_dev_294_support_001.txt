Stress-induced corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated P59044 inflammasome inhibition and transmissible enteritis in mice . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Stress alters brain-gut interactions and could exacerbate intestinal disorders , including irritable bowel syndrome . Alterations in the intestinal microbiota have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome . Maintenance of healthy microbiota requires nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-like receptors , pyrin-domain containing ( NLRP ) -6 inflammasomes . We investigated the involvement of P59044 in water-avoidance stress ( P42768 ) -induced intestinal disorders in mice . METHODS : B57BL6 mice were subjected to P42768 for 1 hour each day for 10 days ; body weights and intestinal inflammation and permeability were analyzed . We investigated signaling via the Q96P20 and P59044 inflammasomes , and the role of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) in P42768 -associated inflammation and P59044 inhibition . Mice that were not exposed to stress were co-housed with mice subjected to P42768 to determine the effects of P42768 -induced dysbiosis , measured by sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA . We also assessed the effects of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist and probiotics . RESULTS : P42768 -induced small-bowel inflammation ( enteritis ) was associated with inhibition of P59044 , but not Q96P20 , and was prevented by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist , which induced epithelial expression of P59044 . P06850 was released during P42768 and inhibited P59044 expression . P42768 induced alterations in the gut microbiota of mice ; co-housed nonstressed mice developed enteritis associated with increased P06850 and decreased levels of P59044 . Probiotic therapy reduced intestinal inflammation in mice with P42768 -induced enteritis . CONCLUSIONS : Exposure of mice to stress inhibits P59044 and alters the composition of the gut microbiota , leading to intestinal inflammation . These findings might explain the benefits of probiotics for patients with stress-associated gastrointestinal disorders .
