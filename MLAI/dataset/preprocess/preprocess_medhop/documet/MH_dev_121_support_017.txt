Inhibition of cellular growth and migration by suppression of endothelial protein C receptor ( Q9UNN8 ) in lung carcinoma cells . Increasing evidence shows that beyond its role in coagulation , thrombosis interferes with carcinogenesis . Q9UNN8 ( Q9UNN8 ) is a cellular receptor for protein C and activated protein C ( P25054 ) . Such Q9UNN8 -induced signal transduction promotes cancer cell migration , invasion , and angiogenesis and inhibits cancer cell apoptosis . However , its role in lung carcinoma biology is yet to be demonstrated . Here , the recombinant Q9UNN8 siRNA plasmids were constructed to investigate the effects of inhibition of Q9UNN8 on human lung cancer H1299 . Q9UNN8 siRNA led to inhibition of endogenous Q9UNN8 mRNA and protein expression as determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis . Q9UNN8 siRNA significantly inhibited cell growth , blocked entry into the S phase of the cell cycle , and reduced the migration of H1299 cells . Q9UNN8 siRNA also decreases P08253 and cyclin E expression in H1299 cells . In addition , siRNA targeting of Q9UNN8 inhibited the growth of H1299 cells and decreased P53602 in SCID mice tumor models . Taken together , Q9UNN8 was involved in regulating progression of human lung cancer cells . Manipulation of Q9UNN8 expression may be a potential therapeutic strategy for lung cancer .
