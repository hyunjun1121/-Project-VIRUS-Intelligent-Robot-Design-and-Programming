Fifteen-year quest for microphthalmia-associated transcription factor target genes . O75030 ( O75030 ) was initially shown to play a key role in melanocyte differentiation through the direct transcriptional control of TYROSINASE , P17643 and P40126 genes , encoding the three enzymes involved in melanin synthesis or melanogenesis . Sixteen years after the first description of O75030 , more than 40 direct O75030 target genes have been described . They play a key role in melanocyte , osteoclast and mast cell specific functions . Furthermore , several O75030 target genes , e.g. P10415 , P24941 , P38936 , CDKN2A , MET and Q16665 , link O75030 to general cellular processes such as growth or survival . In this review , we provide an overview of the O75030 -regulated genes . We pay special attention to the O75030 target genes in melanocytes and raise questions about target specificity .
