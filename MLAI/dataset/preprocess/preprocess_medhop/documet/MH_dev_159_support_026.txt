Depletion of Nrf2 enhances inflammation induced by oxyhemoglobin in cultured mice astrocytes . Q16236 ( Nrf2 ) -antioxidant response element pathway has been proved to be the key regulator in reducing inflammatory damage , which is involved in subarachnoid hemorrhage ( Q53FZ2 ) . Here , in a traditional in vitro Q53FZ2 model , we investigated the effect of Nrf2 depletion on pro-inflammatory cytokines production . Primary cultured astrocytes from Nrf2 wild type ( WT ) or knockout ( KO ) mouse were exposed or not exposed to oxyhemoglobin ( OxyHb ) . Then the DNA-binding activity of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) was detected by EMSA . The expression of P01375 -α , IL-1β , P05231 and P14780 were evaluated . The activity of P14780 was measured by Gelatin zymography . After exposure to OxyHb , NF-κB was activated and the expression of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines was up-regulated in astrocytes . And such up-regulation was much higher in KO astrocytes than in WT astrocytes , which means more aggravated inflammation in Nrf2 deficient astrocytes . These results suggest that astrocytes participate in inflammatory process after Q53FZ2 and the absence of Nrf2 may induce more aggressive inflammation through activation of NF-κB pathway .
