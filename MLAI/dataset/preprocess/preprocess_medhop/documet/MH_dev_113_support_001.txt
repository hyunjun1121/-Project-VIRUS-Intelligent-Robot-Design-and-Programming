Translational research with pemetrexed in breast cancer . DB00642 ( Alimta ) is a novel folate antimetabolite that primarily inhibits the enzymes thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase ( GARFT ) , all of which are involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis . In a phase II trial of patients with DB00279 /4 , N0-2 breast cancer , expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , p53 , and c-erb-B2 ( at the mRNA or protein level ) was examined in tumor biopsy specimens before and 24 hours after the first dose of pemetrexed and after three cycles of single-agent treatment to establish correlations of biomarker levels and changes with clinical outcome and toxicity . Although final data are not available , initial indications are that clinical response may correlate with decreased or low TS expression . The results obtained from clinical data are supported by laboratory results in three cell lines ( MDA-231 , MCF-7 , and ZR-75 ) . These results suggest that in vitro transcript profiling to identify which genes are important predictors of successful cytotoxic chemotherapy , followed by a focused clinical trial to confirm the in vitro results , may be the best approach for translational research .
