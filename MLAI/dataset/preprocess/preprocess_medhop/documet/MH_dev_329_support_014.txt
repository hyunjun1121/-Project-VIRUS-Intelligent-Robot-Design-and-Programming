Intraprotein electron transfer in a two-domain construct of neuronal nitric oxide synthase : the output state in nitric oxide formation . Intersubunit intraprotein electron transfer ( IET ) from flavin mononucleotide ( Q68DA7 ) to heme is essential in nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis by NO synthase ( NOS ) . Previous crystal structures and functional studies primarily concerned an enzyme conformation , which serves as the input state for reduction of Q68DA7 by electrons from NADPH and flavin adenine dinucleotide ( DB03147 ) in the reductase domain . To favor the formation of the output state for the subsequent IET from Q68DA7 to heme in the oxygenase domain , a novel truncated two-domain oxyFMN construct of rat neuronal NOS ( P29475 ) , in which only the Q68DA7 and heme domains were present , was designed and expressed . The kinetics of IET between the Q68DA7 and heme domains in the P29475 oxyFMN construct in the presence and absence of added calmodulin ( P62158 ) were directly determined using laser flash photolysis of CO dissociation in comparative studies on partially reduced oxyFMN and single-domain heme oxygenase constructs . The IET rate constant in the presence of P62158 ( 262 s(-)(1) ) was increased approximately 10-fold compared to that in the absence of P62158 ( 22 s(-)(1) ) . The effect of P62158 on interdomain interactions was further evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectra . This work provides the first direct evidence of the P62158 control of electron transfer ( ET ) between Q68DA7 and heme domains through facilitation of the Q68DA7 /heme interactions in the output state . Therefore , P62158 controls IET between heme and Q68DA7 domains by a conformational gated mechanism . This is essential in coupling ET in the reductase domain in NOS with NO synthesis in the oxygenase domain .
