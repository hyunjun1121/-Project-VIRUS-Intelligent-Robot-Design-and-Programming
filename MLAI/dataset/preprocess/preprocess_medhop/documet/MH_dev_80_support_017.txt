Single-center experience with ipilimumab in an expanded access program for patients with pretreated advanced melanoma . DB06186 , a P16410 -blocking monoclonal antibody , improved the overall survival ( OS ) of advanced melanoma patients treated in prospective clinical trials . We here report a study on the outcome of patients with pretreated advanced melanoma offered ipilimumab ( at its licensed dose of 3 mg/kg , every 3 wk for a total of 4 doses ) in an expanded access program at a single-center university hospital . Of the 50 patients initiating ipilimumab , 31 patients completed induction therapy and 9 patients were offered reinduction therapy . Most immune-related adverse events were mild and reversible . The best objective response rate by mWHO-criteria included 1 complete response and 4 partial responses ( best objective response rate of 10 % ) . Two additional patients obtained a partial response by immune-related response criteria . Median OS was 7 months , with a 1- and 2-year survival rate of 45.2 % and 28.8 % , respectively . Long-term disease control with ipilimumab was observed in 7 patients of which 4 received reinduction . Baseline serum P02741 ( CRP ) and the absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) measured on week 6 significantly correlated with OS . In conclusion , in this single-center experience with ipilimumab for advanced pretreated melanoma patients , clinical outcome was comparable with the results of published prospective studies . Reinduction therapy was of importance for maintaining long-term disease control in the majority of responding patients . Baseline CRP and ALC at week 6 deserve further prospective evaluation as prognostic and/or predictive ( surrogate ) markers .
