Radiation hybrid map of 13 loci on the long arm of chromosome 5 . Radiation hybrid mapping was used in conjunction with a natural deletion mapping panel to predict the order of and distance between 13 loci in the distal portion of the long arm of human chromosome 5 . A panel of irradiation hybrids containing fragments of 5q was generated from an P00492 + Chinese hamster-human cell hybrid containing a derivative chromosome 5 [ der(5)t(4;5) ( 5qter ---- 5p15.1::4p15.1 ---- 4pter ) ] as its only human DNA . One hundred nine radiation hybrids containing human DNA were screened with polymerase chain reaction primer sets representing nine genes encoding growth factors , growth factor receptors , or hormone receptors ( P08700 , P05112 , P05113 , P07333 , P05230 , P07550 , GRL , P14867 , and P21728 ) as well as four other loci ( P16591 , P09486 , P62263 , and P08571 ) to generate a radiation hybrid map of the area 5q21-q35 . A physical map predicting the order of and distance between the 13 loci was constructed based on segregation of the 13 loci in hybrid clones . The radiation hybrid panel will be useful as a mapping tool for determining the location and order of other genes and polymorphic loci in this region as well as for generating new DNA probes from specific regions .
