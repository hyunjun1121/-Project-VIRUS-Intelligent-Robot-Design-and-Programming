Autocrine/Paracrine secretion of P05231 family cytokines causes angiotensin II-induced delayed P40763 activation . We recently reported that angiotensin II ( AngII ) biphasically activates the JAK/ P35610 pathway and induces delayed phosphorylation of P40763 in the late stage ( 120 min ) in cardiomyocytes . This study was designed to determine the mechanism of delayed phosphorylation of P40763 . Conditioned medium prepared from AngII-stimulated cardiomyocytes could reproduce the tyrosine phosphorylation of P40763 at 5 min . This delayed phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by anti- P40189 blocking antibody RX435 , but not by TAK044 ( P25101 /B-R antagonist ) , prazosin , or propranolol . AngII induced phosphorylation of P40189 in the late stage , which was temporally in parallel with the delayed phosphorylation of P40763 . AngII augmented P05231 , Q16619 , and P15018 mRNA expression at 30-60 min , but not P26441 expression . AngII increased P05231 protein levels by 3-fold in the conditioned media at 2 h compared with the control . These findings indicated that AngII-induced delayed activation of P40763 is caused by autocrine/paracrine secreted P05231 family cytokines .
