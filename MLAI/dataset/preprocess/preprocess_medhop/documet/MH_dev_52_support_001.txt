Alpha-tocopherol decreases tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein from activated human monocytes by inhibition of P09917 . Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity in Westernized populations . Low levels of DB00163 ( AT ) are associated with increased incidence of atherosclerosis and increased intakes appear to be protective . AT supplementation decreases interleukin 1 and 6 release from human monocytes . Thus , the aim of this study was to examine the effect of AT on an important proinflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) release from human monocytes . AT supplementation ( 1200 IU/day for 3 months ) significantly decreased P01375 release from activated human monocytes . Mechanisms that were examined included its effect as a general antioxidant , its inhibitory effect on protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and the cycloxygenase-lipoxygenase pathway . While AT decreased P01375 release from activated monocytes , other antioxidants had no effect on P01375 release . Specific PKC inhibitors had no effect on P01375 release from activated monocytes . The inhibition of P01375 release by AT in activated monocytes was reversed by leukotriene B(4) ( Q06643 (4) ) , a major product of the P09917 ( P09917 ) pathway . Similar observations were seen with inhibitors of P09917 . Indomethacin , a P36551 inhibitor , in the presence and absence of AT failed to affect P01375 activity . These findings suggest that AT decreases P01375 release from activated human monocytes via inhibition of P09917 . Also , AT as well as a P09917 inhibitor significantly decreased P01375 mRNA . Furthermore , AT and the P09917 inhibitor decreased NFkappab-binding activity . Thus , in activated human monocytes , AT appears to inhibit P01375 mRNA and protein by inhibition of P09917 .
