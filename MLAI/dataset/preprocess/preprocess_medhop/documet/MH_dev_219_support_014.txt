Generation and phenotypic characterization of new human ovarian cancer cell lines with the identification of antigens potentially recognizable by HLA-restricted cytotoxic T cells . This study describes a simple method for long-term establishment of human ovarian tumor lines and prediction of T-cell epitopes that could be potentially useful in the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . Nine ovarian tumor lines ( INT.Ov ) were generated from solid primary or metastatic tumors as well as from ascitic fluid . Notably all lines expressed HLA class I , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) , polymorphic epithelial mucin ( P15941 ) and cytokeratin ( CK ) , but not HLA class II , P33681 .1 ( P33681 ) or Q13072 . While of the 9 lines tested 4 ( INT.Ov1 , 2 , 5 and 6 ) expressed the folate receptor ( P15328 ) and 6 ( INT.Ov1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 ) expressed the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) ; MAGE-1 and p185HER-2/neu were only found in 2 lines ( INT.Ov1 and 2 ) and Q13065 expression in 1 line ( INT.Ov2 ) . The identification of class I MHC ligands and T-cell epitopes within protein antigens was achieved by applying several theoretical methods including : 1 ) similarity or homology searches to MHCPEP ; 2 ) BIMAS and 3 ) artificial neural network-based predictions of proteins MAGE , GAGE , P00533 , p185HER-2/neu and P15328 expressed in INT.Ov lines . Because of the high frequency of expression of some of these proteins in ovarian cancer and the ability to determine HLA binding peptides efficiently , it is expected that after appropriate screening , a large cohort of ovarian cancer patients may become candidates to receive peptide-based vaccines .
