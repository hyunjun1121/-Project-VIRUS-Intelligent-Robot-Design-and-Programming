P62158 and troponin C : affinity chromatographic study of divalent cation requirements for troponin I inhibitory peptide ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan and fluphenazine binding . The different conformations induced by the binding of Mg2+ or Ca2+ to troponin C ( TnC ) and calmodulin ( P62158 ) results in the exposure of various interfaces with potential to bind target compounds . The interaction of TnC or P62158 with three affinity columns with ligands of either the synthetic peptide of troponin I ( TnI ) inhibitory region ( residues 104-115 ) , mastoparan ( a wasp venom peptide ) , or fluphenazine ( a phenothiazine drug ) were investigated in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ . TnC and P62158 in the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+ bound to the TnI peptide 104-115 . The cation specificity for this interaction firmly establishes that the TnI inhibitory region binds to the high affinity sites of TnC ( most likely the N-terminal helix of site III ) and presumably the homologous region of P62158 . Mastoparan interacted strongly with both proteins in the presence of Ca2+ but , in the presence of Mg2+ , did not bind to TnC and only bound weakly to P62158 . DB00623 bound to TnC and P62158 only in the presence of Ca2+ . When the ligands interacted with either proteins there was an increase in cation affinity , such that TnC and P62158 were eluted from the TnI peptide or mastoparan affinity column with 0.1 M DB00974 compared with the 0.01 M DB00974 required to elute the proteins from the fluphenazine column . The interaction of these ligands with their receptor sites on TnC and P62158 require a specific and spatially correct alignment of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues on these proteins.
