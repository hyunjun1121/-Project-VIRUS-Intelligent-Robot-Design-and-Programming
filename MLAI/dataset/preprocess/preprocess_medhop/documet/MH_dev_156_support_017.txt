[ Thrombocyte prostacyclin receptors in gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia ] . OBJECTIVE : To determine prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) receptor characteristics in pregnancies complicated by hypertension and to assess any relation to the clinical outcome . METHODS : Radioligand binding studies with [ 3H ] - DB01088 were performed to measure receptor capacity ( Bmax ) and affinity ( Kd-1 ) using platelet membranes from patients with preeclampsia , gestational hypertension or normal pregnancy . RESULTS : P43119 capacity did not differ between the patient groups . In contrast , P43119 affinity was diminished in gestational hypertension and considerably reduced in preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy . A similar pattern was found in fetal growth ( normal pregnancy > gestational hypertension > preeclampsia ) . Furthermore , the rate of low Apgar scores and acidosis was increased in preeclampsia . CONCLUSIONS : In preeclampsia reduced platelet P43119 affinity was found as well as poor pregnancy outcome in comparison with normal pregnancy , whereas these differences were less pronounced in gestational hypertension . This suggests a role of DB01240 and its receptor in gestational hypertension and in particular in preeclampsia .
