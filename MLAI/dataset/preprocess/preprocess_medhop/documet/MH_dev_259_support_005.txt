Lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) acts as a receptor for remnant-like lipoprotein particles ( RLPs ) and mediates RLP-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells . OBJECTIVE : Remnant-like lipoprotein particles ( RLPs ) have been implicated in atherogenesis especially by diabetic dyslipidemia ; however , their receptor(s) and effects on vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) remain unclear . In this study , we examined if lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) acts as a receptor for RLPs and its biological effects in VSMCs . METHODS AND RESULTS : RLPs were isolated from human plasma by immunoaffinity gel containing anti-apolipoprotein A-I and anti-apolipoprotein B-100 monoclonal antibodies . DiI-labeled RLPs were taken up by CHO- P04264 cells stably expressing P78380 but not by wild-type CHO- P04264 cells . RLPs induced P78380 expression and cell migration in bovine VSMCs ( BVSMCs ) , which were significantly suppressed by transfection with P78380 specific siRNAs . Inhibitors of metalloproteinases , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptor tyrosine kinase , heparin-binding P01133 -like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) , MAPK kinase ( Q02750 ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) significantly blocked RLP-induced P78380 expression and cell migration of BVSMCs . CONCLUSIONS : The present study provides direct evidence that P78380 is a novel receptor for RLPs in VSMCs . P78380 -mediated uptake of RLPs may thus play important roles in atherogenesis by inducing P78380 expression and VSMC migration especially in the settings of postprandial hyperlipidemia , diabetes and metabolic syndrome .
