Clinical outcome and cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression in five dogs with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis treated with firocoxib . BACKGROUND : The conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin is catalysed by the cyclo-oxygenases ( P23219 / P35354 ) . Several studies indicate that P35354 is overexpressed in actinic keratosis in humans and dogs . DB09217 is a P35354 -selective inhibitor that blocks the biochemical activity of P35354 . HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the efficacy of firocoxib ( 5 mg/kg orally once daily ) for the treatment of dogs with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis . METHODS : DB09217 5 mg/kg was given orally once daily for 180 days to five dogs with clinical signs and histopathological lesions consistent with solar dermatitis/actinic keratosis . On days 0 , 50 and 180 , the severity of erythema , skin shine , induration and the number of comedones were evaluated by a clinical scoring system . On the same days , samples were collected for histopathology from ' target lesions ' and P35354 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The clinical follow-up showed that four of five dogs improved with the treatment ; improvement in terms of histological findings was correlated with the regularization of the epidermal proliferation rather than the recovery of dermal changes . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE : A role for P35354 might thus be hypothesized in the pathogenesis of canine solar dermatitis .
