Randomised clinical trial : improvement in health outcomes with certolizumab pegol in patients with active Crohn 's disease with prior loss of response to infliximab . BACKGROUND : Crohn 's disease ( CD ) is associated with impaired health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) . DB08904 , administered either every 2 weeks ( q2w ) or q4w , maintains efficacy in patients previously failing on the anti- P01375 agent infliximab ( WELCOME study ) . AIM : To investigate the impact of certolizumab pegol administered q2w and q4w on work productivity and HRQoL in the WELCOME study . METHODS : Patients with loss of response to infliximab received open-label certolizumab pegol induction and were randomised to receive double-blind maintenance treatment with certolizumab pegol 400 mg either q4w or q2w through week 24 , with a final evaluation at week 26 . Work productivity and HRQoL were assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment:CD questionnaire and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire respectively . RESULTS : Baseline HRQoL burden was representative of moderately to severely active CD . HRQoL , daily activity and work productivity improved in both treatment groups as early as week 6 and were maintained through week 26 . Treatment benefits to HRQoL , daily activity and work productivity were similar between the certolizumab pegol q2w vs. q4w groups . CONCLUSIONS : DB08904 therapy results in meaningful improvements in work productivity , daily activities and HRQoL in patients with active CD who previously responded to but either lost response or could not tolerate infliximab ( ClinicalTrials.gov number : NCT00308581 ) .
