Specific cellular responses to DB00163 . In the last 10 years precise cellular functions of DB00163 , some of which are independent of its antioxidant/radical-scavenging ability , have been revealed . Absorption of DB00163 from the gut is a selective process . Other tocopherols are not absorbed or are absorbed to a lesser extent . At the post-translational level , DB00163 inhibits protein kinase C and P09917 and activates protein phosphatase 2A and diacylglycerol kinase . Some genes [ platelet glycoprotein IV/thrombospondin receptor/class B scavenger receptor ( P16671 ) , DB00163 transfer protein ( alpha-TTP ) , alpha-tropomyosin , connective tissue growth factor and collagenase ] are affected by DB00163 at the transcriptional level . alpha-Tocopherol also inhibits cell proliferation , platelet aggregation , monocyte adhesion and the oxygen burst in neutrophils . Other antioxidants , such as beta-tocopherol and probucol , do not mimic these effects , suggesting a nonantioxidant , DB00163 -specific molecular mechanism .
