Cloning , after cloning , knock-out mice , and physiological functions of MAO A and B . Cloning of MAO A and B has demonstrated clearly that MAO A and B are coded by different proteins with 70 % amino acid identity . With the MAO A and B cDNA clones , we showed the tissue distribution and genomic structure of MAO A and B , the latter suggesting that they are derived from the same ancestral gene . The active sites , the role of cysteine residues , the three-dimensional models and the mitochondria targeting domains of both isoenzymes have been established . The transcriptional regulation of MAO A and B has been studied . MAO A KO mice showed increased levels of serotonin ( 5-HT ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) , dopamine ( DA ) whereas MAO B KO mice showed increased phenylethylamine ( PEA ) levels only . Both MAO A and B KO mice showed increased response to stress . MAO A KO mice showed increased emotional learning and memory and aggressive behavior , but the vesicular monoamine transporter ( Q05940 ) , P08908 , 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptors were down regulated . 5- Q13049 antagonist , ketanserin and MDL100907 were able to abolish the aggression , suggesting that the aggressive behavior may be mediated by 5- Q13049 receptor . In contrast , MAO B KO mice are resistant to MPTP , a toxin which induces Parkinson 's syndromes . Studies of these mice suggest that MAO A and B have distinct biochemical and physiological functions .
