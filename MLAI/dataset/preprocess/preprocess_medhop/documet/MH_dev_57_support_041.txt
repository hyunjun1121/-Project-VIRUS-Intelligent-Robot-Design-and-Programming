The P04626 amplicon in breast cancer : Topoisomerase IIA and beyond . P04626 gene amplification is observed in about 15 % of breast cancers . The subgroup of P04626 -positive breast cancers appears to be heterogeneous and presents complex patterns of gene amplification at the locus on chromosome 17q12-21 . The molecular variations within the chromosome 17q amplicon and their clinical implications remain largely unknown . Besides the well-known P11388 gene encoding Topoisomerase IIA , other genes might also be amplified and could play functional roles in breast cancer development and progression . This review will focus on the current knowledge concerning the P04626 amplicon heterogeneity , its clinical and biological impact and the pitfalls associated with the evaluation of gene amplifications at this locus , with particular attention to P11388 and the link between P11388 and anthracycline benefit . In addition it will discuss the clinical and biological implications of the amplification of ten other genes at this locus ( MED1 , Q14849 , Q14451 , P10827 , P10276 , IGFPB4 , P32248 , P35900 , P08727 and P01350 ) in breast cancer .
