Gene polymorphisms impact the risk of rejection with hemodynamic compromise : a multicenter study . BACKGROUND : Rejection with hemodynamic compromise ( P18577 ) is associated with high mortality in heart recipients . This study investigates the association between genetic polymorphisms and P18577 in pediatric heart recipients . METHODS : Data from 532 pediatric heart recipients from six centers in the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study were analyzed for time to P18577 by recipient race , age at transplantation , and genotype at 13 genetic polymorphisms ( P01375 -α A-308G , P05231 G-174C , P27352 -γ T+874A , P22301 G-1082A , C-819T , and C-592A ; FAS A-670G , P48023 C-843T , and P12821 I/D ; and P15692 A-2578C , C-1451T , C+405G , and -2549 I/D ) . RESULTS : P18577 occurred in 126 ( 23.7 % ) patients during the study period . Adjusting for age and race , P22301 G-1082A , FAS A-670G , and P12821 I/D genotypes were associated with P18577 . P22301 G-1082A GG genotype was associated with decreased risk of P18577 with an adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) of 0.49 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.27-0.90 ; P=0.020 ) . FAS A-670G AA genotype was associated with increased risk of P18577 with an adjusted HR of 1.84 ( 95 % CI , 1.25-2.69 ; P=0.002 ) . P12821 II genotype was associated with decreased risk of P18577 with an adjusted HR of 0.58 ( 95 % CI , 0.36-0.95 ; P=0.031 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Recipients with a high anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory genetic profile ( high interleukin-10 ) were protected from P18577 . Conversely , recipients with a pro-apoptotic genetic profile ( high Fas ) or high angiotensin-1-converting enzyme producing genotype were at increased risk of P18577 . This represents progress toward understanding the genetic risk factors of posttransplantation outcomes in pediatric heart recipients .
