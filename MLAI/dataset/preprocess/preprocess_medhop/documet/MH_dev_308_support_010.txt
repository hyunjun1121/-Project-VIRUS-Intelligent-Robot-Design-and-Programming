Electroacupuncture activates corticotrophin-releasing hormone-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalammus to alleviate edema in a rat model of inflammation . BACKGROUND : Studies show that electroacupuncture ( EA ) has beneficial effects in patients with inflammatory diseases . This study investigated the mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation , using a rat model of complete Freund 's adjuvant ( O75347 ) -induced hind paw inflammation and hyperalgesia . DESIGN : Four experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 6-7/per group ) . Inflammation was induced by injecting O75347 into the plantar surface of one hind paw . Experiment 1 examined whether EA increases plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) levels . Experiments 2 and 3 studied the effects of the DB01285 and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) receptor antagonists , DB01285 (11-24) and astressin , on the EA anti-edema . Experiment 4 determined whether EA activates P06850 neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalammus . EA treatment , 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width , was given twice for 20 min each , once immediately post and again 2 hr post- O75347 . Plasma DB01285 levels , paw thickness , and paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus were measured 2 h and 5 h after the O75347 . RESULTS : EA significantly increased DB01285 levels 5 h ( 2 folds ) after O75347 compared to sham EA control , but EA alone in naive rats and O75347 alone did not induce significant increases in DB01285 . DB01285 (11-24) and astressin blocked EA anti-edema but not EA anti-hyperalgesia . EA induced phosphorylation of Q9UHB4 , an essential subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( DB01221 ) receptor , in P06850 -containing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus . CONCLUSION : The data demonstrate that EA activates P06850 neurons to significantly increase plasma DB01285 levels and suppress edema through P06850 and DB01285 receptors in a rat model of inflammation .
