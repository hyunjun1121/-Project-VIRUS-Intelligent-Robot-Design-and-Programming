P30047 -dependent and -independent inhibitors of P30793 . P30047 ( P30047 ) mediates the feedback inhibition of P30793 activity by ( 6R ) -L-erythro- DB00360 ( BH4 ) through protein complex formation . Since guanine and BH4 have a common pyrimidine ring structure , we examined the inhibitory effect of guanine and its analogs on the enzyme activity . DB02377 , 8-hydroxyguanine , 8-methylguanine , and 8-bromoguanine inhibited the enzyme activity in a P30047 -dependent and pH-dependent manner and induced complex formation between P30793 and P30047 . The type of inhibition by this group is a mixed type . All these properties were shared with BH4 . In striking contrast , inhibition by DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine was P30047 -independent and pH-independent . The type of inhibition by DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine was a competitive type . The two compounds did not induce complex formation between the enzyme and P30047 . These results demonstrate that guanine compounds of the first group bind to the BH4-binding site of the P30793 / P30047 complex , whereas DB01667 and 8-mercaptoguanine bind to the active site of the enzyme . Finally , the possible implications in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and Parkinson diseases of the inhibition of P30793 by guanine and 8-hydroxyguanine are discussed .
