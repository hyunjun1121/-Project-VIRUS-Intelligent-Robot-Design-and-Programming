Oxidative stress induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase in cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cells : Potential mechanism for excessive P10145 expression . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a lethal disease caused by defective function of the cftr gene product , the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) that leads to oxidative damage and excessive inflammatory response in lungs of CF patients . We here report the effects of oxidative stress ( hyperoxia , 95 % O(2) ) on the expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin ( IL ) -8 and P25024 /2 receptors in two human CF lung epithelial cell lines ( IB3-1 , with the heterozygous F508del/W1282X mutation and CFBE41o- with the homozygous F508del/F508del mutation ) and two control non-CF lung epithelial cell lines ( S9 cell line derived from IB3-1 after correction with wtCFTR and the normal bronchial cell line 16HBE14o- ) . Under oxidative stress , the expression of P10145 and P25024 /2 receptors was increased in CF , corrected and normal lung cell lines . The effects of oxidative stress were also investigated by measuring the transcription nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activities . Under oxidative stress , no increase of NF-kappaB activation was observed in CF lung cells in contrast to that observed in normal and corrected CF lung cells . The signalling of mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases was further studied . We demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P27361 /2 ) and AP-1 activity was markedly enhanced in CF but not non-CF lung cells under oxidative stress . Consistently , inhibition of P27361 /2 in oxidative stress-exposed CF lung cells strongly decreased both the P10145 production and P25024 /2 expression . Therefore , targeting of P27361 /2 Q96HU1 kinase may be critical to reduce oxidative stress-mediated inflammation in lungs of CF patients .
