DB00398 as treatment for relapsed or refractory pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia . The prognosis for children with acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) has improved with overall survival rates of up to 65 % [ Pui et al. J Clin Oncol 2011 ; 29 : 551-565 ] . However , the cure rate for AML lags behind that of acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Advances in AML leukemogenesis are leading to refined risk stratification . P07333 like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) mutations are independently associated with a poor prognosis . Newer kinase inhibitors , including sorafenib , have shown promise in adult studies . We report three pediatric patients with relapsed AML who achieved a sustained remission with sorafenib . Further trials are necessary to understand the role of sorafenib in pediatric AML .
