Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506 : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase . DB00091 ( DB00091 ; 50 mg/kg ) and Fujimycine ( FK506 ; 5 mg/kg ) , but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin ( 5 mg/kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days . The molecular mechanisms of DB00091 and FK506 toxicity were investigated . P62937 and FK506-binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for DB00091 and FK506 , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract . In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants DB00091 and FK506 , but not by rapamycin . Finally , specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of DB00091 and FK506 , but not rapamycin . These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of DB00091 and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .
