DB00996 prevents oxaliplatin-induced central sensitization in the dorsal horn neurons in rats . OBJECTIVES : The present study aims to study the alteration of glutamatergic transmission in the dorsal horn neurons and the effect of gabapentin on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain in rats . MATERIALS AND METHODS : DB00526 ( 5 mg/kg ) or saline was administered to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats . DB00996 ( 60 mg/kg , IP ) or vehicle was injected daily . Mechanical allodynia was assessed using a series of von Frey filaments . The expression of glutamate receptor subunits ( Q13224 and GluR1 ) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) was measured in the dorsal horn . The glutamatergic strength was recorded in the spinal cord slices . RESULTS : Administration of oxaliplatin induced significant hyperreactivity to mechanical stimuli in rats , which was attenuated by gabapentin . Significant increase in the expression of P23560 was found in the dorsal horn in rats receiving oxaliplatin , which was prevented by gabapentin . Further studies also observed a significant increase in the expression of GluR1 and Q13224 , as well as enhanced glutamatergic transmission in the dorsal horn neurons in rats treated with oxaliplatin . The upregulation of glutamatergic transmission was significantly reversed by gabapentin . CONCLUSION : These results illustrated an increased expression of P23560 and enhanced glutamatergic transmission in rats with oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain , which was markedly attenuated by gabapentin .
