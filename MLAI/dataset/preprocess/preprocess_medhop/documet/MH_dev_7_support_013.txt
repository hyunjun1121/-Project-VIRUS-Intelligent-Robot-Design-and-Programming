Dietary phytochemicals alter epigenetic events and signaling pathways for inhibition of metastasis cascade : phytoblockers of metastasis cascade . Cancer metastasis is a multistep process in which a cancer cell spreads from the site of the primary lesion , passes through the circulatory system , and establishes a secondary tumor at a new nonadjacent organ or part . Inhibition of cancer progression by dietary phytochemicals ( DPs ) offers significant promise for reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer . Consumption of DPs in the diet has been linked to a decrease in the rate of metastatic cancer in a number of preclinical animal models and human epidemiological studies . DPs have been reported to modulate the numerous biological events including epigenetic events ( noncoding micro-RNAs , histone modification , and DNA methylation ) and multiple signaling transduction pathways ( Wnt/β-catenin , Notch , Sonic hedgehog , P35354 , P00533 , MAPK- P29323 , JAK- P35610 , Akt/PI3K/ P42345 , NF-κB , AP-1 , etc. ) , which can play a key role in regulation of metastasis cascade . Extensive studies have also been performed to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying antimetastatic activity of DPs , with results indicating that these DPs have significant inhibitory activity at nearly every step of the metastatic cascade . DPs have anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis and by inhibiting cell growth , migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . Growing evidence has also shown that these natural agents potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways . In this review , we discuss the variety of molecular mechanisms by which DPs regulate metastatic cascade and highlight the potentials of these DPs as promising therapeutic inhibitors of cancer .
