Functional role of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in inhibitory motor innervation in the mouse internal anal sphincter . There is evidence that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( P01282 ) participates in inhibitory neuromuscular transmission ( P30419 ) in the internal anal sphincter ( IAS ) . However , specific details concerning P01282 -ergic P30419 are limited , largely because of difficulties in selectively blocking other inhibitory neural pathways . The present study used the selective P47900 receptor antagonist MRS2500 ( 1 μm ) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine ( l-NNA ; 100 μm ) to block purinergic and nitrergic P30419 to characterize non-purinergic , non-nitrergic ( NNNP ) inhibitory P30419 and the role of P01282 in this response . Nerves were stimulated with electrical field stimulation ( 0.1-20 Hz , 4-60 s ) and the associated changes in contractile and electrical activity measured in non-adrenergic , non-cholinergic conditions in the IAS of wild-type and P01282 (-/-) mice . Electrical field stimulation gave rise to frequency-dependent relaxation and hyperpolarization that was blocked by tetrodotoxin . Responses during brief trains of stimuli ( 4 s ) were mediated by purinergic and nitrergic P30419 . During longer stimulus trains , an NNNP relaxation and hyperpolarization developed slowly and persisted for several minutes beyond the end of the stimulus train . The NNNP P30419 was abolished by VIP6-28 ( 30 μm ) , absent in the P01282 (-/-) mouse and mimicked by exogenous P01282 ( 1-100 nm ) . Immunoreactivity for P01282 was co-localized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase in varicose intramuscular fibres but was not detected in the P01282 (-/-) mouse IAS . In conclusion , this study identified an ultraslow component of inhibitory P30419 in the IAS mediated by P01282 . In vivo , this pathway may be activated with larger rectal distensions , leading to a more prolonged period of anal relaxation .
