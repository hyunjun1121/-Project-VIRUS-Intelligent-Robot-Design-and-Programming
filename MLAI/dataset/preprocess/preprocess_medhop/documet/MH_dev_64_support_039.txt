Q92574 involvement in bladder cancer : diverse effects and therapeutic implications . Q92574 is often mutated in bladder cancer . However the importance of this event in disease pathogenesis and its implications for therapy are uncertain . We used genomic sequencing to examine the involvement of Q92574 in bladder cancer , and signalling pathway analysis and small-molecule screening to identify targeted therapeutic strategies in Q92574 mutant bladder cancer cell lines . Q92574 loss of heterozygosity was seen in 54 % of bladder cancers . Two ( 4.9 % ) of these 41 bladder cancers had Q92574 mutations by exon-based sequencing . Analysis of 27 bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated inactivating Q92574 mutations in three : RT-4 , HCV29 , 97-1 . Interestingly , only RT-4 showed classic feedback inhibition of AKT , and was highly sensitive to treatment with P42345 inhibitors rapamycin and Torin1 . 97-1 cells showed constitutive P00533 activation , and were highly sensitive to combined treatment with the P42345 inhibitor Torin1 and P00533 inhibitors DB01259 or DB08916 . A P15056 missense mutation G469V was found in HCV29 cells , and AKT activation was dependent on P15056 , but independent of P29323 . A kinase inhibitor screen of HCV29 cells showed strong growth inhibition by the Hsp90 inhibitor DB00238 -AUY922 , and we then found synergistic inhibitory effects of DB00238 -AUY922 combined with either Torin1 or rapamycin on cell survival for both HCV29 and 97-1 cells . In aggregate , these findings indicate that there are highly variable mutation profiles and signalling pathway activation in Q92574 -mutant bladder cancer . Furthermore , combined Hsp90/ P42345 inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for Q92574 mutant bladder cancer .
