Signaling cascade that mediates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation induced by atrial natriuretic peptide . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) induces activation of nitric oxide-synthase ( NOS ) . AIMS : to identify the isoform of NOS involved in P01160 effects , to study whether P01160 modifies NOS expression and to investigate the signaling pathways and receptors involved in NOS stimulation . NOS activation induced by P01160 would be mediated by endothelial NOS ( P29474 ) since neuronal or inducible NOS inhibition did not alter P01160 effect . The peptide induced no changes in P29474 protein expression . NOS activity stimulated by P01160 , in the kidney , aorta and left ventricle , was partially abolished by the P16066 /B antagonist , as well as PKG inhibition , but no difference in atria was observed . 8-Br-cGMP partially mimicked the effect of P01160 on NOS in all tissues . NOS stimulation by P01160 in atria disappeared when G protein was inhibited , but this effect was partial in the other tissues . P62158 antagonist abolished NOS stimulation via P01160 . Inhibition of the P98160 , PKC or P19957 kinase/Akt pathway failed to alter NOS activation induced by P01160 . P01160 would activate P29474 in the aorta , heart and kidney without modifying the expression of the enzyme . P01160 would interact with P17342 coupled via G proteins leading to the activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent NOS in atria ; while in ventricle , aorta and kidney , P01160 could also interact with P16066 /B , increasing cGMP , which in turns activates PKG to stimulate P29474 .
