Immune-mediated adverse events associated with ipilimumab ctla-4 blockade therapy : the underlying mechanisms and clinical management . Immunomodulation with the anti- P16410 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has been shown to extend overall survival ( OS ) in previously treated and treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma . Blockade of P16410 signaling with ipilimumab prolongs T-cell activation and restores T-cell proliferation , thus amplifying T-cell-mediated immunity and the patient 's capacity to mount an effective antitumor immune response . While this immunostimulation has unprecedented OS benefits in the melanoma setting , it can also result in immune-mediated effects on various organ systems , leading to immune-related adverse events ( irAEs ) . DB06186 -associated irAEs are common and typically low grade and manageable , but can also be serious and life threatening . The skin and gastrointestinal tract are most frequently affected , while hepatic , endocrine , and neurologic events are less common . With proper management , most irAEs resolve within a relatively short time , with a predictable resolution pattern . Prompt and appropriate management of these irAEs is essential and treatment guidelines have been developed to assist oncologists and their teams . Implementation of these irAE management algorithms will help ensure that patients are able to benefit from ipilimumab therapy with adequate control of toxicities .
