Effects of C-phycocyanin and Spirulina on salicylate-induced tinnitus , expression of DB01221 receptor and inflammatory genes . Effects of C-phycocyanin ( C-PC ) , the active component of Spirulina platensis water extract on the expressions of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B ( Q13224 ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , and cyclooxygenase type 2 ( P35354 ) genes in the cochlea and inferior colliculus ( IC ) of mice were evaluated after tinnitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of salicylate . The results showed that 4-day salicylate treatment ( unlike 4-day saline treatment ) caused a significant increase in Q13224 , P01375 -α , and IL-1β mRNAs expression in the cochlea and IC . On the other hand , dietary supplementation with C-PC or Spirulina platensis water extract significantly reduced the salicylate-induced tinnitus and down-regulated the mRNAs expression of Q13224 , P01375 -α , IL-1β mRNAs , and P35354 genes in the cochlea and IC of mice . The changes of protein expression levels were generally correlated with those of mRNAs expression levels in the IC for above genes .
