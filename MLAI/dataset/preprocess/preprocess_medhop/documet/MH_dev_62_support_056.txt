DB08904 : a review of its use in the management of rheumatoid arthritis . DB08904 ( Cimzia(®) ) is a recombinant , polyethylene glycolylated , antigen-binding fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets and neutralizes tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α . The drug is indicated for subcutaneous use every 2 or 4 weeks ( q2w or q4w ) for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The efficacy of subcutaneous certolizumab pegol in adults with active RA has been investigated in several well designed , placebo-controlled trials . In four pivotal studies of ≤52 weeks duration , patients with moderate to severe disease receiving recommended dosages of certolizumab pegol ( 200 mg q2w or 400 mg q4w ) , either as monotherapy ( after failing prior disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug [ DMARD ] therapy ) or in combination with methotrexate ( after responding inadequately to methotrexate alone ) , experienced rapid clinical improvement , with some combination trials also demonstrating inhibition of radiographic progression . The beneficial effects of certolizumab pegol therapy were generally maintained for up to ≈5 years in clinical trial extensions in which the drug was administered at dosages of 400 mg q4w or q2w . Additional studies suggest certolizumab pegol is also effective in patients who are Asian or have low to moderate disease activity , as well as more clinically representative patient populations . The tolerability profile of certolizumab pegol was acceptable , with infections/infestations the most common adverse events . Thus , certolizumab pegol is an effective option for the management of active RA in adults , although additional long-term and comparative efficacy and tolerability data are needed to help definitively position certolizumab pegol relative to other biological DMARDs , particularly other anti- P01375 agents .
