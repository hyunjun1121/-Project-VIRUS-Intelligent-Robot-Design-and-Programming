Erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer : a review . Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ; Pfizer , Inc. ) is an orally-active , targeted inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 / P00533 ) , which is part of a key regulatory pathway in cancer . Patients with advanced , incurable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) may derive a clinical benefit from first- and second-line chemotherapy , but third-line treatment with available cytotoxic agents is not effective . Remarkably , P00533 / P00533 antagonists have demonstrated activity as second- and even third-line treatment for this disease . Erlotinib is the first of this novel class of drug to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in overall survival , progression free survival and time to disease related symptoms ( cough , pain , shortness of breath ) compared with treatment with best supportive care in patients who have failed standard first- or second-line chemotherapy . This paper reviews the pharmacology , preclinical and clinical data to support the use of erlotinib in NSCLC .
