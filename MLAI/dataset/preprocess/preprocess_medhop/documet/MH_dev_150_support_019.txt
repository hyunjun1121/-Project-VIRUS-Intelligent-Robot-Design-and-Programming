P10275 is widely expressed in bovine placentomes and up-regulated during differentiation of bovine trophoblast giant cells . OBJECTIVES : In cattle no biological role has been definitely identified for placental estrogens and progesterone . However , in the bovine trophoblast androgens may also be produced and have local effects . Thus , the aims of this study were to identify androgen receptor ( AR ) expressing cells and to monitor testosterone tissue concentrations in bovine placentomes throughout gestation . METHODS : Placental AR expression was characterized at the mRNA and protein level applying conventional and real-time RT-qPCR , western blot and immunohistochemistry . DB00624 was measured by radioimmunoassay . RESULTS : AR-mRNA was qualitatively detected from day 50 of gestation until term . Mean relative gene expression levels were constant between day 100 and late gestation . A slight non-significant increase was observed in the prepartal period . With immunohistochemistry distinct nuclear signals were predominantly observed in invasive trophoblast giant cells ( P21980 ) from day 80 until term . In mature P21980 of the trophoblast , immature P21980 and uninucleated trophoblast cells , stromal cells of the chorionic villi , caruncular epithelial and stromal cells immunoreactive score values were low at early and midgestation but increased significantly ( p < 0.01 ) during late gestation and remained high until parturition . With western blot in placentomal tissue a specific band of approximately 110 kDa was detected as it was the case in epididymis used as a positive control . DB00624 concentrations increased from 0.70 ± 0.29 pmol/g wet tissue between days 60-220 to 4.22 ± 1.29 pmol/g during late gestation ( p < 0.001 ) . DISCUSSION : The results are consistent with androgens as active products of bovine placental steroidogenesis . The substantial up-regulation of AR expression during P21980 differentiation suggests that androgens may be related to this process .
