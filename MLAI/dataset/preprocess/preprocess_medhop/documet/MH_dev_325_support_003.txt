Interaction between P20292 and P20815 gene variants significantly increases the risk for cerebral infarctions in Chinese . In this study , we investigated associations between susceptibility genes and cerebral infarctions in a Chinese population , and whether gene-gene interactions increase the risk of cerebral infarctions . Overall , 292 patients with cerebral infarctions and 259 healthy control individuals were included . Eight variants in five candidate genes were examined for the risk of stroke , including the SG13S32 ( rs9551963 ) , SG13S42 ( rs4769060 ) , SG13S89 ( rs4769874 ) , and SG13S114 ( rs10507391 ) variants of the P09917 activating protein ( P20292 ) gene , the G860A ( rs751141 ) variant of the soluble epoxide hydrolase ( P34913 ) gene , the A1075C ( rs1057910 ) variant of the P11712 *2 gene , the C430T ( rs1799853 ) variant of the P11712 *3 gene , and the A6986G ( rs776746 ) variant of the P20815 gene . Gene-gene interactions were explored using generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction methods . There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of the genotypes of the eight candidate genes . The generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed a significant gene-gene interaction between SG13S114 and A6986G , with scores of 10 for cross-validation consistency and 9 for the sign test ( P=0.0107 ) . These gene-gene interactions predicted a significantly higher risk of cerebral infarction ( adjusted for age , hypertension , and diabetes mellitus ; odds ratio=1.80495 % , confidence interval : 1.180-2.759 , P=0.006 ) . A two-loci gene interaction confers a significantly higher risk for cerebral infarction . The combinational analysis used in this study may be helpful in the elucidation of genetic risk factors for common and complex diseases .
