P62158 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ( Q9BYF1 ) and inhibits shedding of its ectodomain . P12821 -2 ( Q9BYF1 ) is a regulatory protein of the renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) and a receptor for the causative agent of severe-acute respiratory syndrome ( P49591 ) , the P49591 -coronavirus . We have previously shown that Q9BYF1 can be shed from the cell surface in response to phorbol esters by a process involving P01375 converting enzyme ( P78536 ; P78536 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that inhibitors of calmodulin also stimulate shedding of the Q9BYF1 ectodomain , a process at least partially mediated by a metalloproteinase . We also show that calmodulin associates with Q9BYF1 and that this interaction is decreased by calmodulin inhibitors .
