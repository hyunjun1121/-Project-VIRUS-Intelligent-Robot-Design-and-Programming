Fc receptor blockade and immune thrombocytopenic purpura . Inhibition of antibody-coated platelet destruction in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) is a well-known mechanism of treatment effect . A number of interventions that would ameliorate the thrombocytopenic effect of ITP patient plasma when infused into normal recipients were demonstrated in 1965 . Subsequently , the antibody-coated chromium-labeled red blood cell clearance study was developed to allow direct in vivo assessment of Fc receptor ( FcR ) blockade . This was first demonstrated for corticosteroids but more extensive investigation began with the study of intravenous infusions of gammaglobulin ( DB00028 ) . The unequivocal demonstration of FcR blockade following DB00028 Initiated novel approaches . One involved the infusion of a monoclonal anti-FcRIII ligand-blocking antibody into patients with refractory ITP . The efficacy of this treatment demonstrated that FcR blockade was not an epiphenomenon but rather an important mechanism of the increase in the platelet count in patients with ITP . Confirmation of its importance was obtained from the infusion of intravenous ( IV ) anti-D and the use of the isolated Fc piece of IgG . Recent studies have begun to explore the possibility of a monoclonal anti- P12314 and monoclonal anti-Ds . In summary , FcR blockade is an important mechanism of treatment effect in patients with ITP . Cytokine release as a consequence of this interaction and other immunomodulatory effects have only begun to be studied .
