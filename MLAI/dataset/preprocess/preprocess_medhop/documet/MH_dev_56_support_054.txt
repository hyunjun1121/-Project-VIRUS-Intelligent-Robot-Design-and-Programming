Activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors induces a long-term enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors in the rat hippocampus . Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from P00915 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus to study the modulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) on synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors . DB00007 ( 10(-9)-10(-7) M ) , a specific DB00644 analog , concentration-dependently elicited a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors . P30968 -induced synaptic potentiation was blocked by 1 microM [ Acetyl-3,4-dehydro-Pro1,D-p-F-Phe2,D-Trp3,6 ] - P01148 , a specific P30968 antagonist . Furthermore , P30968 -induced synaptic potentiation was associated with the stimulation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , being considerably attenuated by a potent PKC inhibitor ( 30 microM H-7 ) . The results suggest a long-term enhanced modulation of DB00644 on synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors , possibly via the actions of PKC in the hippocampus that is an important integrative system in the regulation of reproductive processes .
