Understanding the molecular mechanism of blood-brain barrier damage in an experimental model of Japanese encephalitis : correlation with minocycline administration as a therapeutic agent . The blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) serves to protect the central nervous system ( CNS ) from damage by exogenous molecules . Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) , caused by a neurotropic flavivirus , leads to inflammation in the CNS , neuronal death and also compromises the structural and functional integrity of the BBB . DB01017 , a semisynthetic tetracycline , has been found to be broadly protective in neurological disease models featuring inflammation and cell death and at present , is being evaluated in clinical trials . In the present study , we propose that the neuroprotective role of minocycline in experimental models of JE extends also to the protection of the BBB . Damage to the BBB was assessed by Evan 's blue dye exclusion test after minocycline treatment following Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) infection . A breakdown of the BBB occurred in mice inoculated intravenously with JEV . This resulted in leakage of protein-bound Evan 's blue dye into the brain tissue . Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed an up-regulation of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules following JEV infection . Immunostaining showed leukocyte and neutrophil infiltration following JEV infection . Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline , beginning 24h post-JEV infection , abrogated the effects by reducing BBB damage , decreasing expression of P35228 , Cox-2 , P15692 and also by reducing the elevated level of transcript of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules in the brain . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are known to disrupt the BBB and minocycline was found to significantly decrease the activity of P14780 in brain tissue homogenates . Thus , minocycline , administered at a clinically relevant time , appears to maintain blood-brain barrier integrity following JEV infection .
