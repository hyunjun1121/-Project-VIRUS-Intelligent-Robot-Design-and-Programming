[ Construction of mammalian cell expression vector for pAcGFP-bFADD fusion protein and its expression in CHO- P04264 cell ] . Fas-associated death domain ( Q13158 ) is a signal connection protein in Fas/ P48023 apoptotic path which might play a key role on apoptosis by transferring apoptotic signal . To reveal the intracellular signal transduction molecules involved in the procedure of follicular development in bovine ovary , we cloned Q13158 gene in bovine ovary tissue with RT-PCR , deleted the termination codon in its cDNA and directionally cloned the amplified Q13158 gene into eukaryotic expression vector pAcGFP-N1 including AcGFP , successfully constructed the fusion protein recombinant plasmid . After identifying by restrictive enzyme Bgl II/EcoR I and sequencing , transfected pAcGFP-bFADD into CHO- P04264 cell mediated by Lipofectamine 2000 , observed the expression of AcGFP and detected the transcription and expression of Q13158 by RT-PCR and Western blotting . The results showed that the cattle Q13158 was successfully cloned , the pAcGFP-bFADD fusion protein recombinant plasmid was successfully constructed by introducing Bgl II , EcoR I cloning site at two ends of Q13158 open reading frame and inserting a Kozak sequence before start codon . AcGFP expression was detected as early as 24 h after transfection . The percentage of AcGFP positive cells reached about 65 % after 24 h . A 654 bp transcription was amplified by RT-PCR , and 51.4 kD target protein was detected by Western blotting . Construction of pAcGFP-bFADD recombinant plasmid should be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of regulation of Q13158 on bovine oocytes formation and development .
