Delayed minocycline inhibits ischemia-activated matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 after experimental stroke . BACKGROUND : Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 ( P08253 and P14780 ) are increased in the brain after experimental ischemic stroke in rats . These two proteases are involved with the degradation of the basal lamina and loss of stability of the blood brain barrier that occurs after ischemia and that is associated with thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke . DB01017 is a lipophilic tetracycline and is neuroprotective in several models of brain injury . DB01017 inhibits inflammation , apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation . In this study we investigated whether delayed minocycline inhibits brain MMPs activated by ischemia in a model of temporary occlusion in Wistar rats . RESULTS : Both P08253 and P14780 were elevated in the ischemic tissue as compared to the contra-lateral hemisphere after 3 hours occlusion and 21 hours survival ( p < 0.0001 for P14780 ) . Intraperitoneal minocycline at 45 mg/kg concentration twice a day ( first dose immediately after the onset of reperfusion ) significantly reduced gelatinolytic activity of ischemia-elevated P08253 and P14780 ( p < 0.0003 ) . Treatment also reduced protein concentration of both enzymes ( p < 0.038 for P14780 and p < 0.018 for P08253 ) . In vitro incubation of minocycline in concentrations as low as 0.1 mug/ml with recombinant P08253 and P14780 impaired enzymatic activity and P14780 was more sensitive at lower minocycline concentrations ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : DB01017 inhibits enzymatic activity of gelatin proteases activated by ischemia after experimental stroke and is likely to be selective for P14780 at low doses . DB01017 is a potential new therapeutic agent to acute treatment of ischemic stroke .
