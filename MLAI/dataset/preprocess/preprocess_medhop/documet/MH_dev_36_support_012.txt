DB00175 -induced proangiogenic effects depend upon extracellular P09038 . The P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) have been shown to exert several protective effects on the vasculature that are unrelated to changes in the cholesterol profile , and to induce angiogenesis . The proangiogenic effect exerted by statins has been attributed to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in endothelial cells ; however , it is unclear how statins activate this pathway . DB00175 -mediated activation of Akt and MAPK occurs rapidly ( within 10 min. ) and at low doses ( 10 nM ) . Here , we hypothesized that P09038 contributes to the proangiogenic effect of statins . We found that pravastatin , a hydrophilic statin , induced phosphorylation of the FGF receptor ( FGFR ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . SU5402 , an inhibitor of FGFR , abolished pravastatin-induced PI3K/Akt and MAPK activity . Likewise , anti- P09038 function-blocking antibodies inhibited Akt and MAPK activity . Moreover , depletion of extracellular P09038 by heparin prevented pravastatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK . Treatment with P09038 antibody inhibited pravastatin-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation . These observations indicate that pravastatin exerts proangiogenic effects in endothelial cells depending upon the extracellular P09038 .
