Interactions of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and P01375 receptor family members in the mouse and human . Ligands of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily ( TNFSF ) ( P41273 , APRIL , Q9Y275 , P32970 , P32971 , P29965 , EDA1 , Q92838 , P48023 , Q9UNG2 , O43557 , lymphotoxin alpha , lymphotoxin alphabeta , P23510 , O14788 , TL1A , P01375 , O43508 , and P50591 ) bind members of the P01375 receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) . A comprehensive survey of ligand-receptor interactions was performed using a flow cytometry-based assay . All ligands engaged between one and five receptors , whereas most receptors only bound one to three ligands . The receptors O75509 , Q969Z4 , Q9NS68 , P08138 , and mouse TNFRH3 did not interact with any of the known TNFSF ligands , suggesting that they either bind other types of ligands , function in a ligand-independent manner , or bind ligands that remain to be identified . The study revealed that ligand-receptor pairs are either cross-reactive between human and mouse ( e.g. Tweak/Fn14 , Q9Y6Q6 / O14788 ) , strictly species-specific ( Q9Y5U5 / Q9UNG2 ) , or partially species-specific ( e.g. OX40/ P23510 , P25942 / P29965 ) . Interestingly , the receptor binding patterns of lymphotoxin alpha and alphabeta are redundant in the human but not in the mouse system . Ligand oligomerization allowed detection of weak interactions , such as that of human P01375 with mouse P20333 . In addition , mouse APRIL exists as two different splice variants differing by a single amino acid . Although human APRIL does not interact with Q96RJ3 , the shorter variant of mouse APRIL exhibits weak but detectable binding to mouse Q96RJ3 .
