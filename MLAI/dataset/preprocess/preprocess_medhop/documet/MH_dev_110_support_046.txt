Interactions between A-9THC and capsaicin on isolated lamb bladder detrusor . A number of studies have demonstrated that capsaicin , a capsicum alkaloid , can affect isolated bladder tissue with either a relaxation or a contraction , depending on the species , by acting on Q8NER1 receptors . In a previous work on isolated lamb detrusor , we demonstrated that capsaicin generally produces a relaxation of the tissue ; this relaxation seems to be mediated by P80511 . Endogenous cannabinoids , such as anandamide , produce some of their actions by stimulating Q8NER1 receptors and this seems to cause the release of peptides , e.g. P80511 . The aim of this work was to ascertain whether a cannabinoid , DB00470 ( delta-9THC ) , was able to interfere with the response of the isolated lamb detrusor to capsaicin . A-9THC , at concentrations between 1.6 x 10(-7) and 1.3 x 10(-6) M , displayed no activity on tissues . Instead , following delta-9THC , most of the tissues responded to capsaicin with a contraction that was abolished by atropine ( 9.0 x 10(-7) M ) . It has been reported that cannabinoids can inhibit the release of P80511 by stimulation of P21554 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors . Delta-9THC could act stimulating these receptors and thus inhibiting P80511 release and vesical relaxation . The muscle relaxing component removal could favour the contracting component , usually not active .
