P10415 /BCL-X(L) inhibition induces apoptosis , disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis , and prevents platelet activation . Apoptosis in megakaryocytes results in the formation of platelets . The role of apoptotic pathways in platelet turnover and in the apoptotic-like changes seen after platelet activation is poorly understood . DB05764 ( Navitoclax ) , a specific inhibitor of antiapoptotic P10415 proteins , which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia and other malignancies , induces a dose-limiting thrombocytopenia . In this study , the relationship between P10415 /BCL-X(L) inhibition , apoptosis , and platelet activation was investigated . Exposure to DB05764 induced apoptosis but repressed platelet activation by physiologic agonists . Notably , DB05764 induced an immediate calcium response in platelets and the depletion of intracellular calcium stores , indicating that on P10415 /BCL-X(L) inhibition platelet activation is abrogated because of a diminished calcium signaling . By comparing the effects of DB05764 and its analog ABT-737 on platelets and leukemia cells from the same donor , we show , for the first time , that these P10415 /BCL-X(L) inhibitors do not offer any selective toxicity but induce apoptosis at similar concentrations in leukemia cells and platelets . However , reticulated platelets are less sensitive to apoptosis , supporting the hypothesis that treatment with DB05764 induces a selective loss of older platelets and providing an explanation for the transient thrombocytopenia observed on DB05764 treatment .
