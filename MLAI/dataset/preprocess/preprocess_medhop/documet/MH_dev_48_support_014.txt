P01130 -related protein promotes amyloid precursor protein trafficking to lipid rafts in the endocytic pathway . The major defining pathological hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is the accumulation of amyloid beta protein ( Abeta ) , a small peptide derived from beta- and gamma-secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) . Recent studies have shown that beta- and gamma-secretase activities of P56817 and presenilin , respectively , are concentrated in intracellular lipid raft microdomains . However , the manner in which P05067 normally traffics to lipid rafts is unknown . In this study , using transient transfection and immuno-precipitation assays , we show that the cytoplasmic domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ( Q14764 ) interacts with P05067 and increases Abeta secretion and P05067 beta-CTF ( C-terminal fragment ) generation by promoting P56817 - P05067 interaction . We also employed discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to show that the Q14764 cytoplasmic domain-mediated effect was accompanied by greatly increased localization of P05067 and P56817 to lipid raft membranes , where beta- and gamma-secretase activities are highly enriched . Moreover , we provide evidence that endogenous Q14764 is required for the normal delivery of P05067 to lipid rafts and Abeta generation primarily in the endocytic but not secretory pathway . These results may provide novel insights to block Abeta generation by targeting Q14764 -mediated delivery of P05067 to raft microdomains .
