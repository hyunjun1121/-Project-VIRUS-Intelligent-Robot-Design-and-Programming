DB01197 reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction . Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors to patients with myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction . It has also been reported that an elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) appears to constitute a marker of the risk of recurrent coronary thrombosis . To determine whether the P12821 inhibitor captopril reduces plasma P05121 inhibitor activity , we measured changes in plasma P05121 activity ( IU/ml ) , tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) antigen ( ng/ml ) , and serum P12821 activity ( IU/L ) in 14 survivors of myocardial infarction receiving captopril therapy ( 37.5 mg daily ) and compared them with the values in 15 placebo-treated patients chosen at random . Blood sampling was performed at 07.00 h . In the captopril-treated group , serum P12821 activity decreased significantly , from 14.0 +/- 0.8 to 11.5 +/- 1.2 IU/L 24 h after captopril therapy ( p < 0.01 ) , and those of P05121 activity and t-PA antigen also decreased significantly-from 11.9 +/- 2.8 to 5.5 +/- 2.2 IU/ml ( p < 0.02 ) and from 9.9 +/- 1.0 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively 48 h after captopril therapy . However , the levels of P12821 activity , P05121 activity , and t-PA antigen remained unchanged during the study period in the placebo group . Thus , our data indicate that the administration of captopril to patients with acute myocardial infarction may result in a reduced frequency of recurrent coronary thrombosis by increasing fibrinolytic capacity .
