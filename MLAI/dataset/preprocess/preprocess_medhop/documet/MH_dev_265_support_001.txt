Q13639 receptors located on cholinergic nerves in human colon circular muscle . 5-Hydroxytryptamine 4 ( Q13639 ) receptor agonists promote colonic propulsion . The alteration of circular muscle ( CM ) motility underlying this involves inhibition of contractility via smooth muscle Q13639 receptors and proximal colonic motility stimulation , the mechanism of the latter not having been characterized . Our aim was to identify and characterize a Q13639 receptor-mediated stimulation of human colon CM contractile activity . Q13639 receptor ligands were tested on electrical field stimulation ( O43281 ) -induced contractions of human colonic muscle strips cut in the circular direction ( called ' whole tissue ' strips ) . Additionally , after incubation of tissues with [ 3H ] -choline these compounds were tested on O43281 -induced release of tritium in whole tissue strips and in ' isolated ' CM strips , obtained by superficial cutting in the CM layer . DB05232 and atropine blocked O43281 -induced contractions of whole tissue CM strips . DB06480 ( 0.3 micromol L-1 ) evoked a heterogenous response on O43281 -induced contraction , ranging from inhibition ( most frequently observed ) to enhancement . In the release experiments , O43281 -induced tritium efflux was blocked by tetrodotoxin . DB06480 increased O43281 -induced tritium and [ 3H ] -acetylcholine efflux in whole tissue and in isolated CM strips . All effects of prucalopride were antagonized by the selective Q13639 receptor antagonist GR113808 . The results obtained indicate the presence of excitatory Q13639 receptors on cholinergic nerves within the CM of human colon .
