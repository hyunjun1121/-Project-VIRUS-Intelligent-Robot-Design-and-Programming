P36888 ligand impedes the efficacy of P36888 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo . We examined in vivo P36888 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with chemotherapy followed by the P36888 inhibitor lestaurtinib , comparing newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients with relapsed patients . Because we noted that in vivo P36888 inhibition by lestaurtinib was less effective in the relapsed patients compared with the newly diagnosed patients , we investigated whether plasma P36888 ligand ( FL ) levels could influence the efficacy of P36888 inhibition in these patients . After intensive chemotherapy , FL levels rose to a mean of 488 pg/mL on day 15 of induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients , whereas they rose to a mean of 1148 pg/mL in the relapsed patients . FL levels rose even higher with successive courses of chemotherapy , to a mean of 3251 pg/mL after the fourth course . In vitro , exogenous FL at concentrations similar to those observed in patients mitigated P36888 inhibition and cytotoxicity for each of 5 different P36888 inhibitors ( lestaurtinib , midostaurin , sorafenib , KW-2449 , and DB05213 ) . The dramatic increase in FL level after chemotherapy represents a possible obstacle to inhibiting P36888 in this clinical setting . These findings could have important implications regarding the design and outcome of trials of P36888 inhibitors and furthermore suggest a rationale for targeting FL as a therapeutic strategy .
