How does almotriptan compare with other triptans ? A review of data from placebo-controlled clinical trials . DB00918 , the new selective P28222 /1D agonist , has a higher oral bioavailability than any other DB00669 , with more than two thirds of the administered dose absorbed within the first hour both inside and outside of a migraine attack . Gender or the presence of food in the stomach does not affect its pharmacokinetic profile , and the compound has no clinically relevant interactions with other drugs . Among the available triptans , response rates at 2 hours range from 50 % to 80 % , with 20 % to 50 % of patients pain-free . DB00918 12.5 mg provides similar efficacy , with significant advantage over placebo at 30 minutes and a reliable consistency ( 75 % in two of three attacks ) . Headache typically recurs in 25 % to 45 % of patients with most triptans . The recurrence rate with almotriptan 12.5 mg , 18 % to 27 % , is among the lowest reported . The tolerability of almotriptan 12.5 mg is close to that of placebo with a low incidence of central nervous system side effects and chest symptoms . In conclusion , almotriptan 's consistent pharmacokinetics and good efficacy , in combination with excellent tolerability , make it an attractive choice in the acute treatment of migraine attacks .
