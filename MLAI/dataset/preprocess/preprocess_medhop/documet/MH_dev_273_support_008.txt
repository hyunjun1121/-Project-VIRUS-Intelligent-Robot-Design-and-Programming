DB02010 -induced growth inhibition of glioma cells is accompanied by altered expression of cyclins , CDKs and CDK inhibitors . DB02010 was found to bring about complete growth inhibition of human glioma cell lines . U87 MG cells were arrested in S phase while U373 MG cells in G2/M phase on staurosporine treatment . Consistent with this observation , no change in P55008 phase regulators viz. , P12004 D1 , D3 and P11802 was seen on staurosporine treatment . The levels of P24941 , P06493 , P12004 A and P12004 B proteins decreased , while the levels of CDK inhibitors viz. , P38936 and p27 were found to increase on staurosporine treatment . The mRNA levels of P24941 and P06493 genes were also found to decrease on staurosporine treatment . Thus apart from staurosporine 's known direct inhibitory effect on P24941 and P06493 activities , staurosporine was found to down-regulate activities of these two kinases by modulating the expression of the kinases themselves as well that of their activating partners ( Cyclins ) and their inhibitors .
