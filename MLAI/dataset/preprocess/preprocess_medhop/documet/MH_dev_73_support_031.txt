CB2 receptors in the brain : role in central immune function . Recently , it has been recognized that the cannabinoid receptor CB2 may play a functionally relevant role in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . This role is mediated primarily through microglia , a resident population of cells in the CNS that is morphologically , phenotypically , and functionally related to macrophages . These cells also express the cannabinoid receptor P21554 . The P21554 receptor ( CB1R ) is constitutively expressed at low levels while the CB2 receptor ( CB2R ) is expressed at higher levels and is modulated in relation to cell activation state . The relatively high levels of the CB2R correspond with microglia being in ' responsive ' and ' primed ' states , suggesting the existence of a ' window ' of functional relevance during which activation of the CB2R modulates microglial activities . Signature activities of ' responsive ' and ' primed ' microglia are chemotaxis and antigen processing , respectively . The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol has been reported to stimulate a chemotactic response from these cells through the CB2R . In contrast , we have shown in vivo and in vitro that the exogenous cannabinoids DB00470 and CP55940 inhibit the chemotactic response of microglia to Acanthamoeba culbertsoni , an opportunistic pathogen that is the causative agent of Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis , through activation of the CB2R . It is postulated that these exogenous cannabinoids superimpose an inhibitory effect on pro-chemotactic endocannabinoids that are elicited in response to Acanthamoeba . Furthermore , the collective results suggest that the CB2R plays a critical immune functional role in the CNS .
