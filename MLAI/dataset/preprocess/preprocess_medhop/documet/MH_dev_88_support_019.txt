[ P10912 antagonist in the treatment of acromegaly ] . Exploration of construction , function and interaction of human growth hormone and growth hormone receptor in details resulted in the innovation of the new growth hormone receptor antagonist , pegvisomant . DB00082 with different mechanism of action extended the tools of medical management of acromegaly . Importance of the novel treatment modality is high . In one hand the necessity of the strict control of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis has been proven regarding the mortality of the disease . On the other hand , despite the use of all current modes of treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy , dopamine agonists , somatostatin analogs ) , a significant cohort of patients with acromegaly remains inadequately controlled . DB00082 has been registered in 2004 . Since 2006 , it has been used in Hungary for the treatment of acromegaly in patients who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or radiation therapy and/or other medical therapies , or for whom these therapies are not appropriate . Clinical use of pegvisomant in the treatment of acromegaly is effective , well tolerated , and safe , based on international Acrostudy database . In order to improve the efficacy of therapy clinical trials started with pegvisomant and somatostatin analog combination treatment . Evidence of several further effects of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis suggests other potential uses of growth hormone receptor antagonists .
