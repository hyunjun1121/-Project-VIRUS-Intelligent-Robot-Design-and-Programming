P14780 in an exploratory trial of intravenous minocycline for acute ischemic stroke . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels predict posttissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) hemorrhage . METHODS : The authors investigated the effect of minocycline on plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 in acute ischemic stroke in the DB01017 to Improve Neurological Outcome in Stroke ( MINOS ) trial and a comparison group . RESULTS : P14780 level decreased at 72 hours compared with baseline in MINOS ( tPA , P=0.0022 ; non-tPA , P=0.0066 ) and was lower than in the non-MINOS comparison group at 24 hours ( tPA , P < 0.0001 ; non-tPA , P=0.0019 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Lower plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 was seen among tPA-treated subjects in the MINOS trial . Combining minocycline with tPA may prevent the adverse consequences of thrombolytic therapy through suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity .
