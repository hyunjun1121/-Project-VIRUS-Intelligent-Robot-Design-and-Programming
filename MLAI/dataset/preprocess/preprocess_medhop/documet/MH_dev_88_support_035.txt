Successful treatment of resistant acromegaly with a growth hormone receptor antagonist . BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE : DB00082 is a pegylated analogue of human GH and functions as a potent P10912 antagonist . This novel mode of action gives it the potential to achieve biochemical control in patients with acromegaly whose disease activity can not be satisfactorily controlled by conventional therapy . We have documented the clinical details of seven patients with residual active acromegaly after surgery and/or radiation therapy successfully treated with pegvisomant . PATIENTS/METHODS : Seven patients ( four male , mean age 47 years , range 34-67 years ) who participated in two separate clinical trials of pegvisomant have completed 2 years ( four patients ) or 1 year ( three patients ) of treatment . All had active acromegaly ( mean serum GH level > 5 mU/l ; serum P05019 elevated for age ) that could not be controlled with standard medical therapy ( dopamine agonist and/or a somatostatin analogue ) following appropriate primary treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy . RESULTS : On a median dose of 20 mg/day ( range 15-40 ) pegvisomant , serum P05019 fell from a mean of 920+/-351 ng/ml ( s.d. ) to 258+/-91 ng/ml and was normalised in all seven patients . These changes were associated with improvements in soft tissue enlargement and general well being . Treatment was well tolerated and no change in pituitary tumour size was evident on Q9BWK5 scans performed every 6 months . CONCLUSIONS : Treatment with pegvisomant is safe and efficacy is maintained after 2 years . Serum P05019 may be normalised in patients who are refractory to conventional therapy .
