DB01017 prevents dynorphin-induced neurotoxicity during neuropathic pain in rats . Despite many advances , our understanding of the involvement of prodynorphin systems in the development of neuropathic pain is not fully understood . Recent studies suggest an important role of neuro-glial interactions in the dynorphin effects associated with neuropathic pain conditions . Our studies show that minocycline reduced prodynorphin mRNA levels that were previously elevated in the spinal and/or dorsal root ganglia ( Q86YR7 ) following sciatic nerve injury . The repeated intrathecal administration of minocycline enhanced the analgesic effects of low-dose dynorphin ( 0.15 nmol ) and U50,488H ( 25-100 nmol ) and prevented the development of flaccid paralysis following high-dose dynorphin administration ( 15 nmol ) , suggesting a neuroprotective effect . DB01017 reverts the expression of IL-1β and P05231 mRNA within the spinal cord and IL-1β mRNA in Q86YR7 , which was elevated following intrathecal administration of dynorphin ( 15 nmol ) . These results suggest an important role of these proinflammatory cytokines in the development of the neurotoxic effects of dynorphin . Similar to minocycline , a selective inhibitor of P14780 ( P14780 levels are reduced by minocycline ) exerts an analgesic effect in behavioral studies , and its administration prevents the occurrence of flaccid paralysis caused by high-dose dynorphin administration ( 15 nmol ) . In conclusion , our results underline the importance of neuro-glial interactions as evidenced by the involvement of IL-1β and P05231 and the minocycline effect in dynorphin-induced toxicity , which suggests that drugs that alter the prodynorphin system could be used to better control neuropathic pain .
