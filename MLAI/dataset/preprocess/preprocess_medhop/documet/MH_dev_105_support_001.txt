X-ray cross-complementing group 1 and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms might predict response to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients . PURPOSE : DB00544 -based chemoradiotherapy before total mesorectal excision is currently the standard treatment of Stage II and III rectal cancer patients . We used known predictive pharmacogenetic biomarkers to identify the responders to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in our series . METHODS AND MATERIALS : A total of 93 Stage II-III rectal cancer patients were genotyped using peripheral blood samples . The genes analyzed were X-ray cross-complementing group 1 ( P18887 ) , P07992 , P42898 , P00533 , Q12882 , and P04818 . The patients were treated with 225 mg/m(2)/d continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concomitantly with radiotherapy ( 50.4 Gy ) followed by total mesorectal excision . The outcomes were measured by tumor regression grade ( TRG ) as a major response ( TRG 1 and TRG 2 ) or as a poor response ( Q9Y512 , TRG4 , and TRG5 ) . RESULTS : The major histopathologic response rate was 47.3 % . P18887 G/G carriers had a greater probability of response than G/A carriers ( odds ratio , 4.18 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.62-10.74 , p = .003 ) Patients with polymorphisms associated with high expression of thymidylate synthase ( 2R/3G , 3C/3G , and 3G/3G ) showed a greater pathologic response rate compared with carriers of low expression ( odds ratio , 2.65 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.10-6.39 , p = .02 ) No significant differences were seen in the response according to P00533 , P07992 , MTHFR_C677 and MTHFR_A1298 expression . CONCLUSIONS : P18887 G/G and thymidylate synthase ( 2R/3G , 3C/3G , and 3G/3G ) are independent factors of a major response . Germline thymidylate synthase and P18887 polymorphisms might be useful as predictive markers of rectal tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil .
