A whole genome Bayesian scan for adaptive genetic divergence in West African cattle . BACKGROUND : The recent settlement of cattle in West Africa after several waves of migration from remote centres of domestication has imposed dramatic changes in their environmental conditions , in particular through exposure to new pathogens . West African cattle populations thus represent an appealing model to unravel the genome response to adaptation to tropical conditions . The purpose of this study was to identify footprints of adaptive selection at the whole genome level in a newly collected data set comprising 36,320 SNPs genotyped in 9 West African cattle populations . RESULTS : After a detailed analysis of population structure , we performed a scan for SNP differentiation via a previously proposed Bayesian procedure including extensions to improve the detection of loci under selection . Based on these results we identified 53 genomic regions and 42 strong candidate genes . Their physiological functions were mainly related to immune response ( MHC region which was found under strong balancing selection , P11912 , P61073 , P80370 , P48380 , Q9H3S1 , Q8IUC6 and P19474 ) , nervous system ( Q96NK8 , O95897 , MAGI1 , Q9H3S1 and Q13639 ) and skin and hair properties ( P24530 , TRSP1 and Q8IUC2 ) . CONCLUSION : The main possible underlying selective pressures may be related to climatic conditions but also to the host response to pathogens such as Trypanosoma(sp) . Overall , these results might open the way towards the identification of important variants involved in adaptation to tropical conditions and in particular to resistance to tropical infectious diseases .
