[ Influence of serotonergic transmission on response to olanzapine ] . INTRODUCTION : This study aimed to investigate associations between the response to olanzapine and genetic variations ( polymorphisms ) in serotonergic transmission related genes in a sample of prospectively studied schizophrenic patients treated with this drug . METHODOLOGY : A total of 51 non-related patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were treated with olanzapine ( mean dose : 12 mg/day ; range : 5-25 mg ) and followed-up for at least three months . Response to olanzapine was measured by the difference between baseline and post-treatment scores on the PANSS and GAS scales . The following polymorphisms were studied : serotonin receptor 5- Q13049 ( 102-T/C , His452Tyr ) , serotonin receptor P28335 ( Cys23Ser , -330- P19440 /-244-CT ) , and serotonin transporter ( VNTR , 5-HTTLPR ) . RESULTS : Global clinical improvement , measured with both the GAS and PANSS total scores , was observed . When patients were divided into responders and non-responders , the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies was similar to the one observed in previous studies with clozapine . When regression analyses were undertaken , polymorphism 330-GT/-244-CT of the P28335 serotonin receptor and 5-HTTLPR of the serotonin transporter showed a tendency towards the association to olanzapine response . CONCLUSIONS : The present study provides preliminary evidence of the important role of variations in serotonin transmission related genes in determining clinical response to olanzapine . Considering previous studies , it can also be concluded that olanzapine and clozapine may have similar affinities to serotonin receptors .
