Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab : no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion . BACKGROUND : DB00087 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against P31358 , a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes , monocytes and NK cells . Its use results in a profound decrease in P01730 positive T lymphocytes . DB00087 is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers . We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections , particularly those previously associated with decrease in P01730 positive T lymphocytes . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifteen percent ( 69/449 ) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection . However , no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae , Listeria monocytogenes , non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex . Fungaemia was rare , occurring in 1.5 % of patients . The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus ( 21 episodes ) , coagulase negative Staphylococcus ( 14 episodes ) , Klebsiella pneumoniae ( 12 episodes ) , Enterococcus faecium ( 11 episodes ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 10 episodes ) , Enterococcus faecalis ( 9 episodes ) and Escherichia coli ( 7 episodes ) . DISCUSSION : We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound P01730 positive T lymphocyte depletion , alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of P01730 cell depletion , such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome .
