Functional development of the inferior colliculus ( IC ) and its relationship with the auditory brainstem response ( Q12979 ) in the tammar wallaby ( Macropus eugenii ) . To discover the developmental relationship between the auditory brainstem response ( Q12979 ) and the focal inferior colliculus ( IC ) response , 32 young tammar wallabies were used , by the application of simultaneous Q12979 and focal brainstem recordings , in response to acoustic clicks and tone bursts of seven frequencies . The IC of the tammar wallaby undergoes a rapid functional development from postnatal day ( P01160 ) 114 to 160 . The earliest ( P01160 114 ) auditory evoked response was recorded from the rostral IC . With development , more caudal parts of the IC became functional until age about P01160 127 , when all parts of the IC were responsive to sound . Along a dorsoventral direction , the duration of the IC response decreased , the peak latency shortened , while the amplitude increased , reaching a maximum value at the central IC , then decreased . After P01160 160 , the best frequency ( BF ) of the ventral IC was the highest , with values between 12.5 and 16 kHz , the BF of the dorsal IC was the lowest , varying between 3.2 and 6.4 kHz , while the BF of the central IC was between 6.4 and 12.5 kHz . Between P01160 114 and 125 , the IC response did not have temporal correlation with the Q12979 . Between P01160 140 and 160 , only the early components of the responses from the ventral and central IC correlated with the P4 waves of the Q12979 . After P01160 160 , responses recorded from different depths of the IC had a temporal correlation with the Q12979 .
