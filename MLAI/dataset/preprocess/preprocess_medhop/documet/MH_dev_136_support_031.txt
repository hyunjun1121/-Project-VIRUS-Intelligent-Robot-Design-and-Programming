Changes in skeletal muscle size and glucose tolerance with electrically stimulated resistance training in subjects with chronic spinal cord injury . OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of residence-based , resistance exercise training ( P07949 ) on affected skeletal muscle size and glucose tolerance after long-standing , complete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . DESIGN : Before-after trial . SETTING : University laboratory trial . PARTICIPANTS : Five men with chronic , complete SCI ( P01031 - P02786 ) . INTERVENTION : Magnetic resonance images of the thighs and an oral glucose tolerance test were performed before and after P07949 . Subjects performed P07949 with both thighs , 2 d/wk for 4 sets of 10 unilateral , dynamic knee extensions for 12 weeks . Neuromuscular electric stimulation induced P07949 by activating the knee extensors . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area ( Q13216 ) , plasma glucose , and insulin concentrations were measured before and after P07949 . Results Skeletal muscle Q13216 increased by 35 % in the right quadriceps femoris ( from 32.6 cm2 to 44.0 cm2 ) and by 39 % in the left quadriceps femoris ( from 34.6 cm2 to 47.9 cm2 ) as a result of training ( P < .05 ) . There were no significant changes in blood glucose or insulin after training . However , a trend for a reduction in plasma glucose levels was observed ( P = .074 ) . Conclusions Affected skeletal muscle can achieve substantial hypertrophy years after SCI with resistance exercise . Furthermore , our results suggest that this type of training may enhance glucose disposal .
