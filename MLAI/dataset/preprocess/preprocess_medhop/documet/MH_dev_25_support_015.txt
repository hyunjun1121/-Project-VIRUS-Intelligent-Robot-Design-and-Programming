Development of a chimeric anti- P25942 monoclonal antibody that synergizes with DB06681 to prolong islet allograft survival . In recent years , reagents have been developed that specifically target signals critical for effective T cell activation and function . Manipulation of the P10747 / P33681 /86 and P25942 /CD154 pathways has exhibited extraordinary efficacy , particularly when the pathways are blocked simultaneously . Despite the reported efficacy of anti-CD154 in rodents and higher models , its future clinical use is uncertain due to reported thromboembolic events in clinical trials . To circumvent this potential complication , we developed and evaluated a chimeric Ab targeting P25942 ( Chi220 , BMS-224819 ) as an alternative to CD154 . Although Chi220 blocks CD154 binding , it also possesses partial agonist properties and weak stimulatory potential . The anti- P25942 was tested alone and in combination with a rationally designed , high affinity variant of P16410 -Ig , DB06681 ( belatacept ) , in a nonhuman primate model of islet transplantation . Although either agent alone only modestly prolonged islet survival ( Chi220 alone : 14 , 16 , and 84 days ; DB06681 alone : 58 and 60 days ) , their combination ( DB06681 and Chi220 ) dramatically facilitated long term survival ( 237 , 237 , 220 , > 185 , and 172 days ) . We found that the effects of Chi220 treatment were not mediated solely through deletion of P11836 -bearing cells and that the combined therapy did not significantly impair established antiviral immunity .
