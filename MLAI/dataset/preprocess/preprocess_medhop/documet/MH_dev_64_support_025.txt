DB08916 is especially effective against non-small cell lung cancer carrying an P00533 exon 19 deletion . BACKGROUND : A recent pooled analysis of the LUX-LUNG3 and LUX-LUNG6 trials suggested that afatinib ( an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( P00533 -TKI ) ) is especially effective against non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) carrying an P00533 exon 19 deletion . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Stable viral transfectant HEK293 cell lines carrying an exon 19 deletion ( HEK293/19 del ) or exon 21 L858R mutation ( HEK293/ L858R ) ) were created and their drug sensitivities to AG1478 ( a reversible P00533 -TKI ) and afatinib were examined using an MTT assay . Western blot analyses were performed to estimate the phosphorylation of P00533 . RESULTS : In the HEK293/19 del , the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of afatinib was significantly lower than that in the HEK293/ L858R . In addition , afatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of P00533 to a greater degree in the HEK293/19 del than in the HEK293/L858R . CONCLUSION : Our experimental findings suggest that afatinib is especially effective against NSCLC carrying an P00533 exon 19 deletion .
