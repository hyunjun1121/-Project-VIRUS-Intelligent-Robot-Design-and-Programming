Secreted cyclophilin A , a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase , mediates matrix assembly of hensin , a protein implicated in epithelial differentiation . Q9UGM3 is a rabbit ortholog of Q9UGM3 , a multifunctional , multidomain protein implicated in the regulation of epithelial differentiation , innate immunity , and tumorigenesis . Q9UGM3 in the extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) induced morphological changes characteristic of terminal differentiation in a clonal cell line ( clone C ) of rabbit kidney intercalated cells . Although hensin is secreted in monomeric and various oligomeric forms , only the polymerized Q13201 form is able to induce these phenotypic changes . Here we report that hensin secretion and matrix assembly were inhibited by the peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) inhibitors cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) and a derivative of cyclosporin A with modifications in the d- DB00133 side chain ( Cs9 ) but not by the calcineurin pathway inhibitor FK506 . PPIase inhibition led to failure of hensin polymerization in the medium and Q13201 , plus the loss of apical cytoskeleton , apical microvilli , and the columnar epithelial shape of clone C cells . P62937 was produced and secreted into the media to a much greater extent than cyclophilins B and C . Our results also identified the direct DB00091 -sensitive interaction of cyclophilin A with hensin , suggesting that cyclophilin A is the PPIase that mediates the polymerization and matrix assembly of hensin . These results are significant because this is the first time a direct role of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity has been implicated in the process of epithelial differentiation .
