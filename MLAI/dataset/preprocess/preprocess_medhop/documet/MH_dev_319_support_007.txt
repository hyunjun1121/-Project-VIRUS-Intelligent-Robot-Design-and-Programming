DB05812 in prostate cancer : a new angle to an old problem . DB05812 acetate is an orally administered potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 , family 17 , subfamily A , polypeptide 1 ( P05093 ) , which is essential for synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol . Although decreasing serum testosterone through inhibition of testicular function is the first line of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer , residual androgens may still be detected in patients treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists . Treatment with abiraterone results in rapid , and complete , inhibition of androgen synthesis in the adrenal glands and potentially within the tumor itself . An overall survival benefit of maximal androgen suppression was recently shown in a randomized placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial of abiraterone with prednisone versus prednisone in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy . DB05812 's efficacy shows the importance of androgen signaling in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic disease , with additional confirmation from recent studies of other novel agents such as MDV3100 , an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor . These promising results now pose a new angle to an old problem about hormonal therapy and raise new questions about how resistance develops , how to best sequence therapy , and how to optimize combinations with other emerging novel agents .
