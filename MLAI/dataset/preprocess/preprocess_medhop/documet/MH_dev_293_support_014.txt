Saccharomyces cerevisiae elongation factor 2 . Mutagenesis of the histidine precursor of diphthamide yields a functional protein that is resistant to diphtheria toxin . Protein synthesis elongation factor 2 ( P13639 ) is the target of the ADP-ribosylating activity of diphtheria toxin which is responsible for cell killing . DB03223 , an unique post-translationally modified histidine residue , is both required for and the site of this ADP-ribosylation . Although present in the P13639 of all eukaryotes and archaebacteria , the function of diphthamide is unknown . Here we describe the site-specific mutagenesis of the histidine precursor of diphthamide , histidine 699 , in yeast P13639 . Plasmid-borne EFT was randomly mutagenized at the histidine 699 codon , and the technique of plasmid shuffling was utilized to select strains that were maintained by the mutant EFT . These mutants were screened for diphtheria toxin resistance . Sequence analysis of the EFT in 49 toxin-resistant isolates showed that histidine 699 had been replaced by 1 of 4 amino acids : asparagine , glutamine , leucine , or methionine . All 11 of the possible codons corresponding to these 4 amino acids were found . The growth rates of cells sustained by the mutant forms of P13639 were slightly slower than those of isogenic wild-type cells . We conclude that despite its strict conservation and universal post-translational modification , the histidine precursor of diphthamide is not essential to the function of yeast P13639 in protein synthesis .
