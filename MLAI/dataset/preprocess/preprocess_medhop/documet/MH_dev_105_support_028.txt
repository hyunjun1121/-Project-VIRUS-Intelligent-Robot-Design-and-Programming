Q07869 ligands decrease human airway smooth muscle cell migration and extracellular matrix synthesis . Airway smooth muscle cells produce extracellular matrix proteins , which in turn can promote smooth muscle survival , proliferation and migration . Currently available therapies have little effect on airway smooth muscle matrix production and migration . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) ligands are reported to decrease migration and matrix production in various cell lines . In this study , we examined the effect of Q07869 ligands on human airway smooth muscle ( HASM ) matrix production and migration . Q07869 expression was examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting . Endogenous Q07869 activity was examined by transfecting cells with a Q07869 response element-luciferase reporter plasmid . We observed that HASM cells express PPARα , β and γ . A six-fold induction of luciferase activity was observed by stimulating cells with a pan-agonist , indicating endogenous Q07869 activity . The Q07869 ligands ciglitazone , 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J(2) and WY-14643 decreased migration towards platelet-derived growth factor receptor . This was not mediated by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation or promoting P60484 activity , but partly through cyclooxygenase-2 induction and prostaglandin E(2) production that increased cyclic AMP levels in the cells . All three ligands also caused an inhibition of collagen and fibronectin secretion by cultured smooth muscle cells . We conclude that Q07869 ligands decrease HASM migration and matrix production and are , therefore , potentially useful for modulating airway remodelling .
