Epoprostenol ( prostacyclin , DB01240 ) binding and activation of adenylate cyclase in platelets of diabetic and control subjects . 1 The binding of epoprostenol ( prostacyclin , DB01240 ) to isolated fractured human platelets has been studied using tritiated DB01240 . 2 High and low affinity binding sites for DB01240 have been identified ( Kd values = 16 and 382 nM ) . 3 Analysis of the prostacyclin-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase suggests that enzyme activation is mediated by the high affinity binding site . 4 Platelet P43119 binding and adenylate cyclase activation by DB01240 are unchanged in diabetic and normal human platelets . 5 This work suggests that hyperaggregability of diabetic platelets is not due to any alteration of platelet prostacyclin receptor numbers or their activation .
