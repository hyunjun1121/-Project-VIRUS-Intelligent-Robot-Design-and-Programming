Rosiglitazone improves survival and hastens recovery from pancreatic inflammation in obese mice . Obesity increases severity of acute pancreatitis ( AP ) by unclear mechanisms . We investigated the effect of the P37231 agonist rosiglitazone ( RGZ , 0.01 % in the diet ) on severity of AP induced by administration of IL-12+ Q14116 in male C57BL6 mice fed a low fat ( LFD ) or high fat diet ( HFD ) , under the hypothesis that RGZ would reduce disease severity in HFD-fed obese animals . In both LFD and HFD mice without AP , RGZ significantly increased body weight and % fat mass , with significant upregulation of adiponectin and suppression of erythropoiesis . In HFD mice with AP , RGZ significantly increased survival and hastened recovery from pancreatic inflammation , as evaluated by significantly improved pancreatic histology , reduced saponification of visceral adipose tissue and less severe suppression of erythropoiesis at Day 7 post-AP . This was associated with significantly lower circulating and pancreas-associated levels of P05231 , P17931 , osteopontin and P01033 in HFD + RGZ mice , particularly at Day 7 post-AP . In LFD mice with AP , RGZ significantly worsened the degree of intrapancreatic acinar and fat necrosis as well as visceral fat saponification , without affecting other parameters of disease severity or inflammation . Induction of AP lead to major suppression of adiponectin levels at Day 7 in both HFD and HFD + RGZ mice . In conclusion , RGZ prevents development of severe AP in obese mice even though it significantly increases adiposity , indicating that obesity can be dissociated from AP severity by improving the metabolic and inflammatory milieu . However , RGZ worsens selective parameters of AP severity in LFD mice .
