DB00065 induces apoptosis of monocytes and T lymphocytes in a human-mouse chimeric model . P01375 ( P01375 ) antagonism with monoclonal antibodies is an effective therapy for severe Crohn 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis . Recent studies have suggested that induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells contributes to this therapeutic effect . We investigated whether infliximab ( a mouse-human IgG1 chimeric anti- P01375 monoclonal antibody ) could induce apoptosis in vivo in human-mouse chimeras , created by reconstitution of severe combined immunodeficiency/beige mice with THP-1 ( human monocytic cell line ) or Jurkat cells ( human T cell line ) . DB00065 treatment of chimeric mice depleted spleen and peritoneum from THP-1 cells and Jurkat cells and decreased production of the human cytokines P22301 and IL-12 in vivo . Cell death was shown to occur already within 1 h of treatment . DB00065 effects were independent of FcgammaR binding or complement activation . Cell death resulted from apoptosis induction in a caspase-dependent pathway , as evidenced by the in vitro protective effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl- DB00161 -Ala- DB00128 -fluoromethyketone ( Z-VAD-FMK ) . These data provide support for caspase-dependent apoptosis induction being the mechanism of action of infliximab in vivo .
