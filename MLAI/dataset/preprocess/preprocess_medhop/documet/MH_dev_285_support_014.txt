Down-regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) gene expression by bile acids in primary rat hepatocytes is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway . DB04540 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) , the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis , is feedback-inhibited at the transcriptional level by hydrophobic bile acids . Recent studies show that bile acids are physiological ligands for farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) . Activated Q96RI1 indirectly represses P22680 transcription through induction of small heterodimer protein ( Q15466 -1 ) . In this study , we provide evidence that bile acids rapidly down-regulate P22680 transcription via activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway . Furthermore , we demonstrate that Q15466 -1 is also a direct target of activated c-Jun . In primary rat hepatocyte cultures , taurocholate ( TCA ) strongly activated JNK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner . P01375 -alpha , a potent activator of JNK , also rapidly activated JNK and down-regulated P22680 mRNA levels . Overexpression of dominant-negative P45983 or a transactivating domain mutant of c-Jun significantly blocked the ability of TCA to down-regulate P22680 mRNA . In contrast , overexpression of wild-type c-Jun ( c-Jun(wt) ) enhanced the repression of P22680 by TCA . Moreover , overexpression of c-Jun(wt) resulted in increased Q15466 -1 promoter activity . Mutation of a putative AP-1 ( c-Jun ) element suppressed c-Jun-mediated activation of the Q15466 -1 promoter construct . These results indicate that the bile acid-activated JNK pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating P22680 levels in primary rat hepatocytes .
