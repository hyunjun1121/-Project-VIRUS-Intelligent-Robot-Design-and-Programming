Vitamin D analogues . The plethora of actions attributed to 1,25(OH)2D3 throughout the body have suggested potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases , immune dysfunction , endocrine disorders , and metabolic bone disease . However , the potent calcemic activity of the natural vitamin D hormone has precluded its use in most cases . New vitamin D analogues are under development that display greater specificity , in most cases , by retaining the therapeutic properties of 1,25(OH)2D3 , but with lower calcemic activity . Two analogues have been approved for use in patients : calcipotriol ( DB02300 from Leo Pharmaceuticals , Copenhagen , Denmark ) for the treatment of psoriasis ; and 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 ( DB00910 from Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) for secondary hyperparathyroidism . Many others analogues are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancer and osteoporosis , and for immunosuppression . The selectivity of the analogues can be attributed to the combined interactions with four proteins : the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , the serum vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) , the vitamin D-24-hydroxylase and to a newly described membrane receptor . Low DBP affinity has been shown to be responsible for the reduced calcemic actions of calcipotriol and 22-oxacalcitriol ( O75051 ) , which is being tested for secondary hyperparathyroidism . However , the low calcemic activity of other analogues , including 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D2 , involves other , as yet undefined , mechanisms . Understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of the vitamin D analogues will allow the design of more effective and safer vitamin D compounds for the treatment of a wide range of clinical disorders .
