P10244 prevents growth arrest associated with terminal differentiation of monocytic cells . P10244 is a transcriptional regulator of gene expression and is highly homologous to c-Myb in its N-terminal DNA binding domain . However , unlike c-myb , whose expression is restricted largely to immature hematopoietic cells , B-myb mRNA has been found to be expressed in all proliferating mammalian cell lines and is clearly regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner . That c-Myb and P10244 proteins perform different roles in proliferation and/or differentiation is suggested by the redundancy of their expression . It was previously shown that degenerated c-Myb expression can inhibit P05231 induced terminal differentiation of the leukemia cell line M1 . We found that , unlike the downregulation of c-Myb protein which is an early response of progenitor M1 cells to P05231 treatment , the downregulation of P10244 occurs late , just prior to terminal differentiation and growth arrest . It was , therefore , of interest to examine the role of the murine P10244 protein in the proliferation and differentiation of the M1 cells and to compare these effects to those of c-Myb in the same system . Clones ectopically producing P10244 , like those ectopically expressing c-Myb , proliferated in the presence of the differentiation-inducing agent and did not undergo the programmed cell death which normally follows terminal macrophage differentiation . In addition , the cell-cycle distribution of M1/ P10244 cells was comparable to untreated cells . Although M1/ P10244 and M1/c-Myb clones treated with P05231 appeared quite immature , differentiation markers were demonstrated to be maintained at near normal levels ( e.g. MyD88 , Mac-2 ) , or be partially reduced in expression ( P01024 , Fc and Mac-1 receptors ) suggesting that the cells had undergone commitment to maturation , but were unable to terminally differentiate .
