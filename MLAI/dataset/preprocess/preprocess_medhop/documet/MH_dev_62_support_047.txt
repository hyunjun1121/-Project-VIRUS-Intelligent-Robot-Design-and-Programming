DB08904 : a new biologic targeting rheumatoid arthritis . The past decade has been an exciting period for clinical research and patient care in rheumatoid arthritis . This is mostly due to targeted biologic agents that have changed the outcome of this disease . DB08904 ( Cimzia(®) , UCB Inc. , GA , USA ) , which targets P01375 -α with a different mechanism of action than widely used biologics , was initially investigated for Crohn 's disease but has now been shown to be effective for rheumatoid arthritis . There have been three significant clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of certolizumab pegol in active rheumatoid arthritis ; two with combination methotrexate and one with monotherapy . This article will summarize the data from those trials and compare some of the characteristics of certolizumab pegol to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and other biologic agents . Treatment recommendations are beyond the scope of this review ; however , with many options available , there will be annotations on current trends in the care of this chronic disease .
