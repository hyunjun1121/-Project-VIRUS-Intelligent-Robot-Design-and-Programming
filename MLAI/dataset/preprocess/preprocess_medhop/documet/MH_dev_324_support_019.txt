Oral L-serine supplementation reduces production of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids in mice and humans with hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1 . Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 ( HSAN1 ) causes sensory loss that predominantly affects the lower limbs , often preceded by hyperpathia and spontaneous shooting or lancinating pain . It is caused by several missense mutations in the genes encoding 2 of the 3 subunits of the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) . The mutant forms of the enzyme show a shift from their canonical substrate L-serine to the alternative substrate L-alanine . This shift leads to increased formation of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids ( dSLs ) . Our initial analysis showed that in P29320 cells transfected with O15269 mutants , dSL generation was modulated in vitro in the presence of various amino acids . We therefore examined whether in vivo specific amino acid substrate supplementation influenced dSL levels and disease severity in HSAN1 . In mice bearing a transgene expressing the C133W O15269 mutant linked to HSAN1 , a 10 % L-serine–enriched diet reduced dSL levels . L-serine supplementation also improved measures of motor and sensory performance as well as measures of male fertility . In contrast , a 10 % L-alanine–enriched diet increased dSL levels and led to severe peripheral neuropathy . In a pilot study with 14 HSAN1 patients , L-serine supplementation similarly reduced dSL levels . These observations support the hypothesis that an altered substrate selectivity of the mutant P21549 is key to the pathophysiology of HSAN1 and raise the prospect of l-serine supplementation as a first treatment option for this disorder .
