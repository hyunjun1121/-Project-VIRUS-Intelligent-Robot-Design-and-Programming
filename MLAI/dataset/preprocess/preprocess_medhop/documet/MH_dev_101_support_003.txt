DB01645 down-regulates androgen receptor by modulating Q9UBN7 -Hsp90 chaperone function . P10275 ( AR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the steroid hormone receptor family and is very important for the development and progression of prostate cancer . The soy isoflavone genistein has been shown previously to down-regulate AR in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP . However , the mechanism(s) by which AR is down-regulated by genistein is still not known fully . We show a new mechanism by which genistein inhibits AR protein levels . We show that genistein-treated LNCaP cells exhibit increased ubiquitination of AR , suggesting that AR protein is down-regulated via a proteasome-mediated pathway . AR is normally stabilized by the chaperone activity of the heat shock protein Hsp90 . The increased ubiquitination of AR after genistein treatment is attributed to decreased Hsp90 chaperone activity as assessed by its increased functionally inactive acetylated form . Consistent with this result , we find that Q9UBN7 , which is a Hsp90 deacetylase , is inhibited by the antiestrogenic activity of genistein . Hence , in this study , we elucidate a novel mechanism of AR down-regulation by genistein through inhibition of Q9UBN7 -Hsp90 cochaperone function required to stabilize AR protein . Our results suggest that genistein could be used as a potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancers along with known inhibitors of Q9UBN7 and Hsp90 .
