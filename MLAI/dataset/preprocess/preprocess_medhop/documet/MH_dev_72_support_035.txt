The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) β/δ agonist GW501516 inhibits P05231 -induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) activation and insulin resistance in human liver cells . AIM/HYPOTHESIS : P05231 induces insulin resistance by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) and upregulating the transcription of its target gene O14543 . Here we examined whether the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )β/δ agonist GW501516 prevented activation of the P05231 - P40763 -suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 ( O14543 ) pathway and insulin resistance in human hepatic HepG2 cells . METHODS : Studies were conducted with human HepG2 cells and livers from mice null for Pparβ/δ ( also known as Ppard ) and wild-type mice . RESULTS : GW501516 prevented P05231 -dependent reduction in insulin-stimulated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 ( AKT ) phosphorylation and in P35568 and Q9Y4H2 protein levels . In addition , treatment with this drug abolished P05231 -induced P40763 phosphorylation of Tyr⁷⁰⁵ and Ser⁷²⁷ and prevented the increase in O14543 caused by this cytokine . Moreover , GW501516 prevented P05231 -dependent induction of extracellular-related kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) , a serine-threonine protein kinase involved in serine P40763 phosphorylation ; the livers of Pparβ/δ-null mice showed increased Tyr⁷⁰⁵- and Ser⁷²⁷- P40763 as well as phospho- P27361 /2 levels . Furthermore , drug treatment prevented the P05231 -dependent reduction in phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , a kinase reported to inhibit P40763 phosphorylation on Tyr⁷⁰⁵ . In agreement with the recovery in phospho-AMPK levels observed following GW501516 treatment , this drug increased the AMP/ DB00171 ratio and decreased the DB00171 /ADP ratio . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : Overall , our findings show that the PPARβ/δ activator GW501516 prevents P05231 -induced P40763 activation by inhibiting P27361 /2 phosphorylation and preventing the reduction in phospho-AMPK levels . These effects of GW501516 may contribute to the prevention of cytokine-induced insulin resistance in hepatic cells .
