Signaling of P00533 receptor tyrosine kinases promotes neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo . BACKGROUND : P00533 receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate proliferation , migration , adhesion , differentiation , and survival in many types of cells and play critical roles in many malignancies . Recent reports suggest a role for P00533 signaling in proliferation and survival of neuroblastoma , a common form of pediatric cancer that often has an extremely poor outcome . METHODS : The authors examined P00533 family expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples by flow cytometry , western blot , and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( Q-PCR ) . Response to P00533 inhibition was assessed in vitro by cell-cycle analysis and western blot and in vivo by serial tumor-size measurements . RESULTS : A panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and primary patient tumors expressed P00533 , HER-3 , and HER-4 , with HER-2 in some tumors . HER-4 mRNA was expressed predominantly in cleavable isoforms . Whereas P00533 inhibition with erlotinib and pan- P00533 inhibition with DB05424 inhibited P01133 -induced phosphorylation of P00533 , AKT , and P27361 /2 , only DB05424 induced growth inhibition and dose-dependent apoptosis in vitro . Both DB05424 and erlotinib treatment of neuroblastoma xenograft tumors resulted in decreased tumor growth in vivo , although DB05424 was more effective . In vivo expression of P00533 was observed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells . CONCLUSIONS : Pan- P00533 inhibition is required for P00533 -related neuroblastoma apoptosis in vitro , although P00533 contributes indirectly to tumor growth in vivo . Inhibition of P00533 in endothelial cells may be an important aspect of erlotinib 's impact on neuroblastoma growth in vivo . Our results suggest that non- P00533 P00533 family members contribute directly to neuroblastoma growth and survival , and pan- P00533 inhibition represents a potential therapeutic target for treating neuroblastoma .
