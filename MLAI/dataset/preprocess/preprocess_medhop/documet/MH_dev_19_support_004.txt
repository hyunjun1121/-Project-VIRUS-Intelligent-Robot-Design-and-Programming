Pivotal role of the P06681 domain of the Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in substrate selection . The P06681 -WW-HECT-type ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 play a critical role in embryogenesis and adult bone homeostasis via regulation of bone morphogenetic protein , Wnt , and RhoA signaling pathways . The intramolecular interaction between P06681 and HECT domains autoinhibits the ligase activity of Smurf2 . However , the role of the Smurf1 P06681 domain remains elusive . Here , we show that the P06681 -HECT autoinhibition mechanism is not observed in Smurf1 , and instead its P06681 domain functions in substrate selection . The Smurf1 P06681 domain exerts a key role in localization to the plasma membrane and endows Smurf1 with differential activity toward RhoA versus Q99717 and Runx2 . Crystal structure analysis reveals that the Smurf1 P06681 domain possesses a typical anti-parallel Î²-sandwich fold . Examination of the sulfate-binding site analysis reveals two key lysine residues , Lys-28 and Lys-85 , within the P06681 domain that are important for Smurf1 localization at the plasma membrane , regulation on cell migration , and robust ligase activity toward RhoA , which further supports a Ca(2+)-independent localization mechanism for Smurf1 . These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified role of the Smurf1 P06681 domain in substrate selection and cellular localization .
