Sirtuin activators and inhibitors . Sirtuins 1-7 ( Q96EB6 -7 ) belong to the third class of deacetylase enzymes , which are dependent on NAD(+) for activity . Sirtuins activity is linked to gene repression , metabolic control , apoptosis and cell survival , DNA repair , development , inflammation , neuroprotection , and healthy aging . Because sirtuins modulation could have beneficial effects on human diseases there is a growing interest in the discovery of small molecules modifying their activities . We review here those compounds known to activate or inhibit sirtuins , discussing the data that support the use of sirtuin-based therapies . Almost all sirtuin activators have been described only for Q96EB6 . DB02709 is a natural compound which activates Q96EB6 , and may help in the treatment or prevention of obesity , and in preventing tumorigenesis and the aging-related decline in heart function and neuronal loss . Due to its poor bioavailability , reformulated versions of resveratrol with improved bioavailability have been developed ( resVida , Longevinex(Â®) , DB05073 ) . Molecules that are structurally unrelated to resveratrol ( SRT1720 , SRT2104 , SRT2379 , among others ) have been also developed to stimulate sirtuin activities more potently than resveratrol . Sirtuin inhibitors with a wide range of core structures have been identified for Q96EB6 , Q8IXJ6 , Q9NTG7 and Q9NXA8 ( splitomicin , sirtinol , AGK2 , cambinol , suramin , tenovin , salermide , among others ) . Q96EB6 inhibition has been proposed in the treatment of cancer , immunodeficiency virus infections , Fragile X mental retardation syndrome and for preventing or treating parasitic diseases , whereas Q8IXJ6 inhibitors might be useful for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases .
