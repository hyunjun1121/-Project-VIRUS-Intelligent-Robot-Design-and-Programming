Anti-angiogenic effects of Hypericin-photodynamic therapy in combination with DB00482 in the treatment of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is being investigated as an alternative treatment modality in cancer treatment . It has been shown to induce tumor hypoxia and upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . The objective of this study was to improve in vivo tumor growth control of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , treated at a subcurative dosage by using a combination of Hypericin-PDT and P35354 inhibitor , DB00482 ( CX ) . The effect of an initial CX dose at 6- and 24-h post-PDT was investigated simultaneously . It was observed that hypoxic NPC/CNE2 cells upregulate both P35354 and P15692 A genes in vitro . In vivo studies , down-regulation of P35354 and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) genes at 24-h post-PDT and bulk tumor ablation at 48-h post-PDT was observed . However , 24-28 days later regrowth was observed . In a combination treatment , 1st CX dose at 6-h post-PDT had the highest tumor control in which tumors were < or=0.52 cm(3) ( 64.29 % , P < 0.05 ) . However , the tumors administered with a initial dose of CX at 24-h post-PDT had no tumor control . Co-suppression of P35354 , HIF-1alpha and P15692 A genes were observed in tumors with tumor control . Mice without tumor control that were subjected to therapy had increased human P15692 in serum compared to Hypericin-PDT mice . Thus , suggesting that the time of initial administration of CX post-PDT is an important factor for effective tumor control .
