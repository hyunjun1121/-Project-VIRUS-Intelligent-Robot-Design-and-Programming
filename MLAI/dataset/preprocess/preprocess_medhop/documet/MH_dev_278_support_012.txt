P30968 and peritoneal plasmin activity . Most surgical procedures performed by obstetrician-gynecologists are associated with pelvic adhesions that cause subsequent serious sequelae , including small bowel obstruction , infertility , chronic pelvic pain , and difficulty in postoperative treatment , including complexity during subsequent surgical procedures . This study was conducted to determine if gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues ( GnRHa ) affect the expressing tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) and its inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) in peritoneal cells in culture . Human peritoneal Met5A cells were used to examine the effects of GnRHa leuprolide , buserelin and goserelin on the levels of t-PA and PA-1 . Antigen concentrations were measured in conditioned media and cell lysates by real-time PCR and ELISA . P30968 ( GnRHR ) mRNA was determined by RT-PCR . GnRHR mRNA was detected in Met5A cells . Exposure of Met5A cells to GnRHa induced a rapid decrease of P05121 level in cultured medium but not in cell lysate ( protein and mRNA ) . These effects of GnRHa on P05121 were not associated with any changes in t-PA level . These results suggest that GnRHa may be an effective stimulator of local peritoneal fibrinolytic activity , as it decreases P05121 secretion in peritoneal Met5A cells by a mechanism linked to GnRHR .
