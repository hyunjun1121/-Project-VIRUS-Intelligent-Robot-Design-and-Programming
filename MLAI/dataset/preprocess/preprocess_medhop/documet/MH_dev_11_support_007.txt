Altered regulation of renal nitric oxide , atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclooxygenase systems in aldosterone escape in rats . The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered role of local nitric oxide ( NO ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) systems in the kidney in association with the aldosterone escape . Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used . DB04630 ( 200 microg/day ) was infused through entire time course . The control group was kept on a low sodium diet ( 0.02 mEq/day ) , and the experimental group was supplied with a higher sodium diet ( 2. /day ) . Four days after beginning the regimen , the kidneys were taken . The protein expression of NO synthase ( NOS ) and P36551 isoforms was determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting . The mRNA expression of components of P01160 system was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction . The activities of soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases were determined by the amount of cGMP generated in responses to sodium nitroprusside and P01160 , respectively . There developed aldosterone escape in the experimental group . Accordingly , the renal content and the urinary excretion of NO increased . The expression of P29475 was increased in the inner medulla . Neither the expression of P29474 nor that of P35228 was changed . The expression and the catalytic activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase remained unaltered . The mRNA expression of P01160 was increased . Neither the expression of P16066 or P17342 nor the activity of particulate guanylyl cyclase was altered in the papilla . The protein expression of P35354 was increased in the inner medulla , while that of P23219 remained unchanged . In conclusion , the upregulation of P29475 , P01160 , and P35354 may be causally related with the aldosterone escape .
