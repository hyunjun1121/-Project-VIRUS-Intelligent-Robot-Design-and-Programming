Behavioral and physiologic effects of genetic or pharmacologic inactivation of the DB05875 receptor ( NK1 ) . Depression and anxiety are among the most common diseases in the United States , thus constituting a substantial financial burden for the health care system . Experimental studies of these affective disorders to date have largely focused on the neurotransmitter pathways with well-established pathophysiologic roles , such as serotonergic , noradrenergic , and gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -ergic systems ; agents modulating the activity of these pathways are known to be clinically effective . More recently , the neuropeptide DB05875 ( SP ) and its receptor ( the neurokinin-1 receptor [ P25103 ] ) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders , including depression . Earlier preclinical and clinical studies , though , did not provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the regulation of affective behavior and related pathologic conditions . Recent studies in mice clearly demonstrate that both the genetic disruption and acute pharmacologic blockade of the P25103 result in marked reduction in anxiety-like behavior and stress-related responses . In parallel with these behavioral effects , physiologic changes , such as an increased firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei and a desensitization of presynaptic P08908 inhibitory autoreceptors , were observed . These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory role of the SP- P25103 system in modulation of affective behavior and indicate that its effects are mediated , at least in part , via the serotonergic system . Future studies will attempt to delineate the interaction between the SP- P25103 system and various neurotransmitter pathways in greater detail and to address the specific role(s) of this system in different brain regions .
