DB00197 increases IL-1beta induced cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression via enhanced phosphorylation of P25963 in vascular smooth muscle cells from Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) agonists of the thiazolidinedione class are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes subjects due to their ability to improve insulin resistance . DB00197 and ciglitazone belong to the PPARgamma agonists of thiazolidinediones . We report here that troglitazone but not ciglitazone increased IL-1beta induced cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) expression in vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) from Wistar-Kyoto rats ( WKY ) and spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) . Potentiated expression of P35354 and P35228 by troglitazone was inhibited by MG-132 , a specific inhibitor of inhibitory factor kappaB ( IkappaB ) activation . DB00197 treatment of these cells also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in IL-1beta induced P25963 phosphorylation . These data suggest that troglitazone is capable of increasing IL-1beta induced P35354 and P35228 expression through an P25963 dependent mechanism in VSMC from WKY and SHR .
