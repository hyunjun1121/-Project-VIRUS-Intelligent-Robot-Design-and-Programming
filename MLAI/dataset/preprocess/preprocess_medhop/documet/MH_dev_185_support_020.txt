DB06268 : an endothelin-A receptor antagonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension . Endothelin ( ET-1 ) is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogen that mediates its effects through activation of P25101 and P24530 receptors . Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by inappropriate overactivation of the ET system . There is clear evidence that strategies that block both ET receptors are associated with clinical improvement in PAH . However , there are theoretical physiological advantages to treatments that specifically inhibit only the P25101 receptor . DB06268 is an orally active selective P25101 receptor antagonist that in recent clinical trials has demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity , functional class and haemodynamics in PAH patients with modified New York Heart Association class II , III and IV symptoms .
