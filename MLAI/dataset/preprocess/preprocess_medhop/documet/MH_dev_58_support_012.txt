Blood-based P32297 single nucleotide polymorphism and outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients . DB00184 acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) are associated with resistance to gemcitabine , cisplatin and paclitaxel in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines . Three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of P32297 , P30532 and LOC123688 increase lung cancer risk . These SNPs may have influenced outcome in patients treated in our phase III trial . Stage IV NSCLC patients were treated with customized chemotherapy based on P07992 ( excision repair cross-complementing 1 ) mRNA expression . Patients in the control arm received docetaxel/cisplatin ; patients in the genotypic arm with low levels of P07992 received docetaxel/cisplatin ; patients in the genotypic arm with high levels of P07992 received docetaxel/gemcitabine . DNA was extracted from lymphocytes , and P32297 ( rs1051730 ) , P30532 ( rs16969968 ) and LOC123688 ( rs8034191 ) SNPs were genotyped with the Taqman allele discrimination assay . A significant interaction was found for P32297 and PS ( P=0.02 ) . In patients with PS 0 , CT patients had a better response than both CC ( P=0.01 ) and TT ( P=0.02 ) patients , and patients in the low genotypic group also had a better response ( P=0.01 ) . When the P32297 genotype was added in the multivariate analysis for progression-free survival , an improvement was observed in the low genotypic group in PS 0 patients ( P=0.02 ) . PS 0 patients in the low genotypic group with the CT genotype attained an 84 % response rate , 12.1-month progression-free survival , and 19-month median survival . P32297 ( rs1051730 ) genotyping can improve customized chemotherapy based on tumor assessment of P07992 mRNA in stage IV NSCLC with PS 0 .
