Relation between hemostatic parameters and prognostic/predictive factors in breast cancer . BACKGROUND : In our study , we searched for a relation between various prognostic and predictive factors and hemostatic parameters . METHODS : One hundred women with newly diagnosed breast cancer after surgery were included . Patients did not receive systemic therapy or radiotherapy . The control group included 100 healthy , age-matched women . In the patient group , age , menopausal status , tumor size , grade , axillary lymph node status , steroid receptor status , p53 , and P04626 /neu were evaluated . Plasma levels of factor VIII , factor IX , D-dimer , fibrinogen , protein C , protein S , P04275 , and antithrombin III were measured in both groups . RESULTS : Plasma levels of factor VIII , factor IX , P04275 , and CRP in patients with breast cancer were higher than those in controls . Protein S levels in patients were lower than in controls . There was no significant difference in other hemostatic parameters between the groups . In patients with axillary lymph node metastasis , factor VIII levels were significantly higher than in node-negative patients . There was a strong correlation between axillary lymph node status , number of metastatic nodes , and factor VIII levels . There was no correlation between factor VIII levels and CRP . Factor VIII levels were higher in the group having high P04626 /neu ( 3+ ) than in the group with negativity for P04626 /neu . CONCLUSION : There was a strong correlation between axillary lymph node involvement , number of metastatic nodules , overexpression of P04626 /neu , hemostatic parameters , and factor VIII levels . Our study showed that factor VIII level measurement can provide additional data for evaluation of breast cancer patients ' prognosis .
