DB09030 , an oral P25116 receptor antagonist , does not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin . PURPOSE : DB09030 is an orally active protease-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) antagonist that inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation . This open-label study assessed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single-dose warfarin in the presence/absence of multiple-dose vorapaxar in 12 healthy men . METHODS : Subjects received two treatments separated by ≥ 7-day washout : Treatment A warfarin 25 mg ( Day 1 ) ; Treatment B vorapaxar 2.5 mg/day on Days 1-6 and vorapaxar 40 mg coadministered with warfarin 25 mg ( Day 7 ) . R-warfarin , S-warfarin , and prothrombin time ( PT ) were assayed predose and up to 120 h postdose . RESULTS : The geometric mean ratio ( GMR ) as a percentage ( warfarin + vorapaxar/warfarin ) was calculated . The GMR ( 90 % CIs ) estimates of C(max) were 105 ( 99 , 111 ) and 105 ( 99 , 112 ) for R- and S-warfarin , respectively . The GMR ( 90 % CIs ) estimates of AUC(0-∞) were 108 ( 101 , 116 ) and 105 ( 96 , 115 ) for R- and S-warfarin , respectively . The GMR ( 95 % CIs ) estimates of AUC ( 0-120 h ) for PT and INR were 97 ( 95 , 98 ) and 96 ( 94 , 98 ) , respectively . CONCLUSION : Results of this study indicate that vorapaxar has no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin , suggesting that the coadministration of these two drugs or vorapaxar coadministered with other P11712 / P33261 substrates is unlikely to cause a clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction .
