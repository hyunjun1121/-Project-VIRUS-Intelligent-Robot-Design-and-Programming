Caveolae and caveolin-1 are implicated in 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3-dependent modulation of Src , MAPK cascades and P11473 localization in skeletal muscle cells . We previously reported that DB00136 induces non-transcriptional rapid responses through activation of MAPKs in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells . However , there is little information on the molecular mechanism underlying the initiation of DB00136 signaling through this pathway . Plasma membrane components have been involved in some non-genomic effects . In this work , we investigated the role of caveolae and caveolin-1 ( cav-1 ) in DB00136 -stimulation of c-Src and MAPKs . When proliferating cells were pretreated with methyl beta cyclodextrin ( MbetaCD ) , a caveolae disrupting agent , under conditions in which cell morphology is not affected and no signs of apoptosis are observed , DB00136 -dependent activation of P27361 /2 , p38 MAPK and c-Src was suppressed . Similar results were obtained by siRNA technology whereby silencing of cav-1 expression abolished activation of c-Src and MAPKs induced by the hormone . By confocal immunocytochemistry it was observed that cav-1 colocalizes with c-Src in the periplasma membrane zone at basal conditions . Hormone treatment disrupted the colocalization of these proteins and redistributed them into cytoplasm and nucleus . Co-immunoprecipitation assays corroborated these observations . Changes in P11473 localization after DB00136 exposure were also investigated . Confocal microscopy images showed that the hormone induces P11473 translocation to the plasma membrane , and this effect is abolished by MbetaCD . Altogether , these data suggest that caveolae is involved upstream in c-Src-MAPKs activation by DB00136 and that P11473 and cav-1 participate in the rapid signaling elicited by the hormone .
