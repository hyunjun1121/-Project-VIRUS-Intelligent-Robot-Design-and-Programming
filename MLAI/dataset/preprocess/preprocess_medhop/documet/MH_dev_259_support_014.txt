DB01109 -binding growth factor type one and platelet-derived growth factor are required for the optimal expression of cell surface low density lipoprotein receptor binding activity in human adult arterial smooth muscle cells . Purified heparin-binding growth factor-1 ( P05230 ) stimulated low density lipoprotein binding , internalization , and degradation in isolated human adult arterial smooth muscle cells . Exposure of quiescent cells to P05230 in serum-free , defined medium increased both low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor activity and de novo cholesterol biosynthesis . Both events preceded the onset of DNA synthesis by 6 to 9 h . P05230 acted additively with platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) to maximally stimulate cell surface P01130 binding activity and DNA synthesis in the smooth muscle cells . The presence of LDL was required for maximal mitogenic activity of P05230 and PDGF . In the presence of LDL , growth factor-stimulated , proliferating human smooth muscle cells accumulated cholesterol ester and triglycerides . The results suggest that P05230 , PDGF , and LDL act together to promote the maximal proliferation of smooth muscle cells in culture . Chronic exposure to the three growth promoters may contribute to the smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and lipid accumulation observed in atherosclerotic lesions .
