Acyl substitution at the ortho position of anilides enhances oral bioavailability of thiophene sulfonamides : TBC3214 , an P25101 selective endothelin antagonist . DB06268 ( 3 , TBC11251 ) ( Wu et al. J. Med. Chem. 1997 , 40 , 1690 ) is an orally active ET(A) selective endothelin antagonist that attenuates pulmonary vascular hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in rats ( Tilton et al. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000 , 13 , 87 ) . It has demonstrated efficacy in a phase II clinical trial for congestive heart failure ( Givertz et al. Circulation 2000 , 101 , 2922 ) . During the discovery of 3 , we observed several structure-oral bioavailability relationships . To investigate whether there is any generality in these trends , we synthesized some similar pairs of compounds in the latest series ( Wu et al. J. Med. Chem. 1999 , 42 , 4485 ) and evaluated their oral properties . In both series , an acyl group at the 2-position of the anilide of these thiophene sulfonamides improved oral bioavailability . As a result of this exercise , TBC3214 ( 17 ) was identified as a sitaxsentan follow-on candidate . It is very potent ( IC(50) for ET(A) = 40 pM ) and highly selective for ET(A) vs ET(B) receptors ( 400 000-fold ) , with a half-life of > 4 h and oral bioavailability of 25 % in rats , 42 % in cats , and 70 % in dogs .
