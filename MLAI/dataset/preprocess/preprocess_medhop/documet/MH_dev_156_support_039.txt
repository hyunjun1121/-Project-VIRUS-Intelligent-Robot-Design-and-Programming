Pecam-1 is a modulator of stat family member phosphorylation and localization : lessons from a transgenic mouse . P16284 ( CD31 ) is a member of the immunoglobin ( Ig ) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules whose expression is restricted to hematopoietic and vascular cells . P16284 can recruit adapter and signaling molecules via its immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ( ITAM ) , suggesting that P16284 plays a role in signal transduction pathways . To study the involvement of P16284 in signaling cascades in vivo , we used the major histocompatibility ( MHC ) I gene promoter to target ectopic P16284 expression in transgenic mice . We noted an attenuation of mammary gland development at early stages of virgin ductal branching morphogenesis . STAT5a , a modulator of milk protein gene expression during lactation , was localized to the nuclei of ductal epithelial cells of 6-week-old virgin P16284 transgenics , but not in control mice . This correlated with decreases in ductal epithelial cell proliferation and induction of P38936 , an inhibitor of cell cycle progression . Using in vitro model systems we demonstrated P16284 /STAT5a association and found that residue Y701 in P16284 's cytoplasmic tail is important for P16284 / P42229 association and that P16284 modulates increases in STAT5a tyrosine phosphorylation levels . We suggest that by serving as a scaffolding , P16284 can bring substrates ( STAT5a ) and enzymes ( a kinase ) into close proximity , thereby modulating phosphorylation levels of selected proteins , as previously noted for beta-catenin .
