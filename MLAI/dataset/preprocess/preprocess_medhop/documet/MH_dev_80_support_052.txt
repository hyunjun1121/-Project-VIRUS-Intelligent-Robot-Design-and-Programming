Safety and efficacy of ipilimumab to treat advanced melanoma in the setting of liver transplantation . DB06186 is a first-in-class immunological checkpoint blockade agent and monoclonal antibody against Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 ( P16410 ) that has demonstrated survival benefit and durable responses in patients with metastatic melanoma . To date , solid organ transplant recipients have been excluded from clinical trials with cancer immunotherapies on the basis of their concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive agents . We present the first case to our knowledge of a patient with advanced cutaneous melanoma receiving ipilimumab status post orthotopic liver transplantation with a partial response . Transaminitis was observed 4 months after administration of ipilimumab that resolved with close observation . No evidence of graft rejection has been observed to date . This case advocates for further investigation of the safety and efficacy of cancer immunotherapies in solid organ transplant recipients .
