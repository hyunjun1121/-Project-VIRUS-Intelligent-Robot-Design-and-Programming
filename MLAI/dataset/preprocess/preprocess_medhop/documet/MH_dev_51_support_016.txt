Exome sequencing of three cases of familial exceptional longevity . Exceptional longevity ( EL ) is a rare phenotype that can cluster in families , and co-segregation of genetic variation in these families may point to candidate genes that could contribute to extended lifespan . In this study , for the first time , we have sequenced a total of seven exomes from exceptionally long-lived siblings ( probands ≥ 103 years and at least one sibling ≥ 97 years ) that come from three separate families . We have focused on rare functional variants ( RFVs ) which have ≤ 1 % minor allele frequency according to databases and that are likely to alter gene product function . Based on this , we have identified one candidate longevity gene carrying RFVs in all three families , P04114 . Interestingly , P04114 is a component of lipoprotein particles together with P02649 , and variants in the genes encoding these two proteins have been previously associated with human longevity . Analysis of nonfamilial EL cases showed a trend , without reaching statistical significance , toward enrichment of P04114 RFVs . We have also identified candidate longevity genes shared between two families ( 5-13 ) or within individual families ( 66-156 genes ) . Some of these genes have been previously linked to longevity in model organisms , such as Q9UBK2 , Q02297 , P43351 , Q06609 , O75376 , and O95622 genes . This work provides an initial catalog of genes that could contribute to exceptional familial longevity .
