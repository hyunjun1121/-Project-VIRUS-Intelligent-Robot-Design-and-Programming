P00533 is a transducer of the urokinase receptor initiated signal that is required for in vivo growth of a human carcinoma . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) activates alpha5beta1 integrin and P29323 signaling , inducing in vivo proliferation of HEp3 human carcinoma . Here we demonstrate that P00533 mediates the Q03405 /integrin/fibronectin ( FN ) induced growth pathway . Its activation is ligand-independent and does not require high P00533 , but does require high Q03405 expression . Only when Q03405 level is constitutively elevated does P00533 become alpha5beta1-associated and activated . Domain 1 of Q03405 is crucial for P00533 activation , and Q05397 links integrin and P00533 signaling . Inhibition of P00533 kinase blocks Q03405 induced signal to P29323 , implicating P00533 as an important effector of the pathway . Disruption of Q03405 or P00533 signaling reduces HEp3 proliferation in vivo . These findings unveil a mechanism whereby Q03405 subverts ligand-regulated P00533 signaling , providing cancer cells with proliferative advantage .
