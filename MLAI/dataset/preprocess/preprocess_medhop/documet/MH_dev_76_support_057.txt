Chronic inhibition of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase 5A prevents and reverses cardiac hypertrophy . Sustained cardiac pressure overload induces hypertrophy and pathological remodeling , frequently leading to heart failure . Genetically engineered hyperstimulation of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cGMP ) synthesis counters this response . Here , we show that blocking the intrinsic catabolism of cGMP with an oral phosphodiesterase-5A ( O76074 ) inhibitor ( sildenafil ) suppresses chamber and myocyte hypertrophy , and improves in vivo heart function in mice exposed to chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction . DB00203 also reverses pre-established hypertrophy induced by pressure load while restoring chamber function to normal . cGMP catabolism by O76074 increases in pressure-loaded hearts , leading to activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase with inhibition of O76074 . O76074 inhibition deactivates multiple hypertrophy signaling pathways triggered by pressure load ( the calcineurin/NFAT , phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt , and P27361 /2 signaling pathways ) . But it does not suppress hypertrophy induced by overexpression of calcineurin in vitro or Akt in vivo , suggesting upstream targeting of these pathways . O76074 inhibition may provide a new treatment strategy for cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling .
