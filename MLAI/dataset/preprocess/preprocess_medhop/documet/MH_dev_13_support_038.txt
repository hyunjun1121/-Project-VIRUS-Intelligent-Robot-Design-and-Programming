Characterization of bortezomib-adapted I-45 mesothelioma cells . BACKGROUND : DB00188 , a proteasome-specific inhibitor , has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic agent . However , development of resistance to bortezomib may pose a challenge to effective anticancer therapy . Therefore , characterization of cellular mechanisms involved in bortezomib resistance and development of effective strategies to overcome this resistance represent important steps in the advancement of bortezomib-mediated cancer therapy . RESULTS : The present study reports the development of I-45-BTZ-R , a bortezomib-resistant cell line , from the bortezomib-sensitive mesothelioma cell line I-45 . I-45-BTZ-R cells showed no cross-resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil , and doxorubicin . Moreover , the bortezomib-adapted I-45-BTZ-R cells had decreased growth kinemics and did not over express proteasome subunit beta5 ( P28074 ) as compared to parental I-45 cells . I-45-BTZ-R cells and parental I-45 cells showed similar inhibition of proteasome activity , but I-45-BTZ-R cells exhibited much less accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins following exposure to 40 nm bortezomib . Further studies revealed that relatively low doses of bortezomib did not induce an unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in the bortezomib-adapted cells , while higher doses induced UPR with concomitant cell death , as evidenced by higher expression of the mitochondrial chaperone protein Bip and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress-related pro-apoptotic protein P35638 . In addition , bortezomib exposure did not induce the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 , Mcl-1S , and noxa in the bortezomib-adapted cells . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that UPR evasion , together with reduced pro-apoptotic gene induction , accounts for bortezomib resistance in the bortezomib-adapted mesothelioma cell line I-45-BTZ-R .
