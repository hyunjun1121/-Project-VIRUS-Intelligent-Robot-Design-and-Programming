DB08890 - a secretagogue and antihyperalgesic agent - what next ? Ongoing clinical trials suggest that linaclotide , a first-in-class , 14-amino acid peptide guanylate cyclase-C ( P25092 ) receptor agonist and intestinal secretagogue is an effective treatment for chronic constipation . A study in this issue of the Journal suggests that linaclotide also has antihyperalgesic effects in three common rat models of inflammation- and stress-induced hypersensitivity ( i.e. , acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid colitis , water avoidance stress [ P42768 ] , and restraint-induced stress ) but not in na√Øve animals . In mice , linaclotide at least partly reduces hyperalgesia via P25092 receptors . Dose-effect relationships of linaclotide were complicated and non-linear . This viewpoint discusses human clinical trials with linaclotide and the results of this study . Potential mechanisms and clinical significance of these findings are explored . Collectively , these data suggest that P25092 receptors exert other , as yet poorly understood , effects on gastrointestinal sensitivity in conditions associated with inflammation and/or stress-induced increased intestinal permeability . However , the data need to be confirmed in humans and in long-term animal models . Further studies are also necessary to elucidate the mechanisms as these effects can not be explained by linaclotide 's known effects on epithelial P25092 receptors .
