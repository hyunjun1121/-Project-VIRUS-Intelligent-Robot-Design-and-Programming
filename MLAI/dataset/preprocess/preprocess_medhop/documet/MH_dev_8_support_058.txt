Fermented soshiho-tang with Lactobacillus plantarum enhances the antiproliferative activity in vascular smooth muscle cell . BACKGROUND : Soshiho-tang ( P61278 ) is a traditional medicine widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis . P61278 has been shown to confer a variety of pharmacological activities , including prevention of hepatotoxicity , promotion of liver regeneration , and modulation of liver fibrosis . In this study , we investigated the antiproliferative activity of native and fermented ( FSST ) formulations of P61278 in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) and examined the potential underlying mechanisms driving these effects . METHODS : P61278 , along with preparations fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum KFRI-144 ( S-A144 ) , L. amylophilus KFRI-161 ( S-A161 ) and L. bulgaricus KFRI-344 ( S-A344 ) , were investigated to determine their effects on the proliferation and viability of VSMCs , along with the signalling pathways underlying these effects . RESULTS : S-A144 exhibited a strong , dose-dependent inhibition of VSMC proliferation relative to untreated controls , but the others did not affect . In addition , S-A144 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and PLCÎ³1 in a dose-dependent manner and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/ P55008 phase characterised by decreased expression of CDKs , cyclins and P12004 . CONCLUSIONS : The findings suggest that S-A144 exhibit enhanced inhibition of DB00102 -induced VSMC proliferation comparison to S-AOR through the suppression of cell cycle progression and expression of cell cycle-related proteins , along with the downregulation of Akt phosphorylation .
