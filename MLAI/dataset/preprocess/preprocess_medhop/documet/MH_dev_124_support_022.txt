Anti-inflammatory secondary metabolites from the leaves of Rosa laevigata . Bioassay-guided fractionation of a n-BuOH-soluble extract of the leaves of Rosa laevigata led to the isolation of three new 19-oxo-18,19-seco-ur-sane-type triterpenoids , laevigins A-C ( 1-3 ) , a new oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin , laevigin D ( 4 ) , a new geranylmethylbenzoate , 5- [ ( 2″E,6″S ) -6″,7″-dihydroxy-3″,7″-dimethyl-2″-octen-1″-yl ] -2-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-methyl benzoate ( 5 ) , together with 9 known compounds ( 6-14 ) . Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic and chemical methods . Compounds 4 , 9 , 11 , and 12 significantly suppressed the LPS-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity and the release of TNFα , IL-1β , P05231 , and P22301 in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages . The compound 12 exhibited moderate inhibition on NF-κB transcriptional activity with an IC50 value of 23.21 μM . The IC50 values of compound 12 were measured as 14.32 , 8.53 , 8.04 , and 10.38 μM for the inhibitory activity on TNFα-release , IL-1β-release , P05231 -release , and P22301 -release , respectively .
