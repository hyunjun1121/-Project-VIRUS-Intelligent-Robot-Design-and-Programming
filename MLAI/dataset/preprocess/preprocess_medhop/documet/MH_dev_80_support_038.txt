The monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 , ipilimumab , in the treatment of melanoma . BACKGROUND : Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 ( P16410 ) is an inhibitory regulator of the T-cell immune response against tumor cells . DB06186 is a monoclonal antibody directed against P16410 . OBJECTIVE : This review describes the basic mechanism of ipilimumab and discusses data available to date with regards to its safety and efficacy profile . METHODS : Data from clinical trials including abstracts was reviewed using the PubMed Database , as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology Abstract Database . CONCLUSION : P16410 inhibition with a monoclonal antibody is usually well tolerated and has efficacy as a therapeutic agent in a variety of cancers . The classical response interpretation has changed because of the delayed mechanism of action . The toxicities are autoimmune events and guidelines for treatment of these effects are discussed . Therapy with ipilimumab leads to durable responses . The first two Phase III randomized studies showed an improvement of survival at 1 , 2 , and 3 years . Other studies are currently underway to better understand the optimal treatment administration of ipilimumab in melanoma .
