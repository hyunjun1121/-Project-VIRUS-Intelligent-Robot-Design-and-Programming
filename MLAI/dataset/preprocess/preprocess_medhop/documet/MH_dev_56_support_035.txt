Cell-cell interaction promotes rat marrow stromal cell differentiation into endothelial cell via activation of P78536 / P01375 signaling . Marrow stromal cells ( MSCs ) are capable of differentiating into various cell types including endothelial cells . Microenvironment is important in cell fate determination . P01375 -alpha converting enzyme ( P78536 ) , a well-characterized " sheddase , " participates in the differentiation process of multiple lineages by the proteolytic release of membrane-bound proteins such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) . We investigated the endothelial differentiation of MSCs under two coculture conditions : 1 ) direct MSCs-rat brain microvascular endothelial cells ( rBMECs ) contact coculture ; and 2 ) indirect coculture of MSCs and rBMECs . Also , we examined the role of P78536 / P01375 signaling in the process of differentiation under direct coculture condition . We found that endothelial differentiation of MSCs was substantially enhanced in MSCs-rBMECs direct contact coculture , but not in indirect transwell coculture condition . Transcript levels of P78536 and P01375 as well as P78536 protein expression were significantly upregulated in direct , but not in indirect , coculture condition . Addition of human recombinant P78536 promoted gene expression of endothelial specific markers including P04275 , CD31 , P33151 , Flk-1 , and Flt-1 in the differentiating MSCs . Furthermore , inhibition of P78536 with TAPI-2 or inhibition of P01375 with DB00005 attenuated endothelial differentiation of MSCs in the direct coculture condition . We demonstrated for the first time that direct MSCs-rBMECs interaction stimulated the endothelial differentiation of MSCs via P78536 /TNFalpha signaling .
