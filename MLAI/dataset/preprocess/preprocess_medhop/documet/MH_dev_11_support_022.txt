Mechanisms for epigallocatechin gallate induced inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes in rat liver microsomes . DB03823 gallate ( EGCG ) inhibits drug metabolizing enzymes by unknown mechanisms . Here we examined if the inhibition is due to covalent-binding of EGCG to the enzymes or formation of protein aggregates . EGCG was incubated with rat liver microsomes at 1-100μM for 30min . The EGCG-binding proteins were affinity purified using m-aminophenylboronic acid agarose and probed with antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( P04406 ) , actin , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A1 , P05177 , CYP2B1/2 , P05181 , CYP3A , catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) and microsomal glutathione transferase 1 ( P10620 ) . All but actin and soluble P21964 were positively detected at ≥1μM EGCG , indicating EGCG selectively bound to a subset of proteins including membrane-bound P21964 . The binding correlated well with inhibition of CYP activities , except for P05181 whose activity was unaffected despite evident binding . The antioxidant enzyme P10620 , but not cytosolic GSTs , was remarkably inhibited , providing novel evidence supporting the pro-oxidative effects of EGCG . When microsomes incubated with EGCG were probed on Western blots , all but the actin and P05181 antibodies showed a significant reduction in binding at ≥1μM EGCG , suggesting that a fraction of the indicated proteins formed aggregates that likely contributed to the inhibitory effects of EGCG but were not recognizable by antibodies against the intact proteins . This raised the possibility that previous reports on EGCG regulating protein expression using P04406 as a reference should be revisited for accuracy . Remarkable protein aggregate formation in EGCG-treated microsomes was also observed by analyzing Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels . EGCG effects were partially abolished in the presence of 1mM glutathione , suggesting they are particularly relevant to the in vivo conditions when glutathione is depleted by toxicant insults .
