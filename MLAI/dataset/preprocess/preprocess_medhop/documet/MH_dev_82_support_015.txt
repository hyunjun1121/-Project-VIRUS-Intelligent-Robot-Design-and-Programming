Changes of Dietary Fat and Carbohydrate Content Alter Central and Peripheral Clock in Humans . CONTEXT : The circadian clock coordinates numerous metabolic processes with light-dark and feeding regimens . However , in humans it is unknown whether dietary patterns influence circadian rhythms . OBJECTIVE : We examined the effects of switching from a high-carbohydrate , low-fat diet to a low-carbohydrate , high fat ( LC/HFD ) isocaloric diet on the central and peripheral circadian clocks in humans . DESIGN : Diurnal patterns of salivary cortisol and gene expression were analyzed in blood monocytes of 29 nonobese healthy subjects before and 1 and 6 weeks after the dietary switch . For this , we established a method of rhythm prediction by 3-time point data . RESULTS : The centrally driven cortisol rhythm showed a phase delay 1 and 6 weeks after the dietary switch to a LC/HFD as well as an amplitude increase . The dietary switch altered diurnal oscillations of core clock genes ( O15534 , O15055 , P56645 , and Q10587 ) and inflammatory genes ( P08571 , Q99467 , P25963 , and P01584 ) . The LC/HFD also affected the expression of nonoscillating genes contributing to energy metabolism ( Q96EB6 ) and fat metabolism ( O15254 and P50213 ) . Expression of clock genes but not of salivary cortisol in monocytes tightly correlated with levels of blood lipids and with expression of metabolic and inflammatory genes . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that the modulation of the dietary fat and carbohydrate content alters the function of the central and peripheral circadian clocks in humans .
