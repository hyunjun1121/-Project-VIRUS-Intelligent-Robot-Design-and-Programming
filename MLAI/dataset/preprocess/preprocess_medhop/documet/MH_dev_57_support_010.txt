Identification of a transcriptionally active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha -interacting cofactor complex in rat liver and characterization of Q9BYK8 as a coactivator . Q07869 ( Q07869 alpha ) plays a central role in the cell-specific pleiotropic responses induced by structurally diverse synthetic chemicals designated as peroxisome proliferators . Transcriptional regulation by liganded nuclear receptors involves the participation of cofactors that form multiprotein complexes to achieve cell- and gene-specific transcription . Here we report the identification of such a transcriptionally active Q07869 alpha-interacting cofactor ( PRIC ) complex from rat liver nuclear extracts that interacts with full-length Q07869 alpha in the presence of ciprofibrate , a synthetic ligand , and leukotriene B(4) , a natural ligand . The liganded Q07869 alpha-PRIC complex enhanced transcription from a peroxisomal enoyl- DB01992 hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl- DB01992 dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme gene promoter template that contains peroxisome proliferator response elements . Rat liver PRIC complex comprises some 25 polypeptides , and their identities were established by mass spectrometry and limited sequence analysis . Eighteen of these peptides contain one or more LXXLL motifs necessary for interacting with nuclear receptors . PRIC complex includes known coactivators or coactivator-binding proteins ( CBP , Q15788 , PBP , PRIP , PIMT , O75448 , Q09428 -2 , and P20142 -1 ) , other proteins that have not previously been described in association with transcription complexes ( CHD5 , TOG , and Q8WYB5 ) , and a few novel polypeptides designated PRIC300 , -285 , -215 , -177 , and -145 . We describe the cDNA for Q9BYK8 , which contains five LXXLL motifs . It interacts with Q07869 alpha and acts as a coactivator by moderately stimulating Q07869 alpha-mediated transcription in transfected cells . We conclude that liganded Q07869 alpha recruits a distinctive multiprotein complex from rat liver nuclear extracts . The composition of this complex may provide insight into the basis of tissue and species sensitivity to peroxisome proliferators .
