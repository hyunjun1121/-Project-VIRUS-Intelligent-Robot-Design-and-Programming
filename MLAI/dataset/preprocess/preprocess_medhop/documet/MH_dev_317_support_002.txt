Comparison of the anti-inflammatory and therapeutic actions of P37231 agonists rosiglitazone and troglitazone in experimental colitis . Non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn`s disease , are chronic non-infectious diseases that showed an increase in prevalence in recent years , particularly in the developed countries . The effective methods of their treatment and prevention of recurrences are currently under investigation . One type of therapy that can prevent the inflammatory recurrence in the gastrointestinal tract is the Q07869 -Î³ agonists thiazolidinediones . Numerous studies available in literature have confirmed the beneficial effects of thiazolidinediones ( glitazones ) , namely rosiglitazone and troglitazone in the gut . The objective of the present study was to compare the possible effects of rosiglitazone 10 mg/kg b.w. or 30 mg/kg b.w. and troglitazone 30 mg/kg b.w. on experimental colitis induced by administration of 1.5 % dextran sodium sulphate ( DSS ) administered in drinking water to rats . Specimens collected from the large intestine were microscopically evaluated , and concentrations of Th1- dependent ( P60568 , P27352 ) and Th2-dependent ( P05112 , P22301 ) cytokines were determined in the serum and intestinal homogenates . Both rosiglitazone and troglitazone have demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties . This observation was confirmed by histopathological and immunoenzymatic tests . The therapeutic efficacy of rosiglitazone was dose-dependent . DB00197 resulted in significantly stronger enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokine expression than rosiglitazone and comparable downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression compared to rosiglitazone used in a higher dose .
