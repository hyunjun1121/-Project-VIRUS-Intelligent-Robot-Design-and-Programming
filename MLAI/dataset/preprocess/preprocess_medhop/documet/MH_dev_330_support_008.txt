A critical importance of polyamine site in DB01221 receptors for neurite outgrowth and fasciculation at early stages of P19 neuronal differentiation . We have investigated the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors type A ( GABA(A)Rs ) at an early stage of P19 neuronal differentiation . The subunit expression was profiled in 24-hour intervals with RT-PCR and functionality of the receptors was verified via fluo-3 imaging of Ca(2+) dynamics in the immature P19 neurons showing that both DB01221 and GABA excite neuronal bodies , but only polyamine-site sensitive NMDAR stimulation leads to enhanced Ca(2+) signaling in the growth cones . Inhibition of Q9UHB4 / Q13224 NMDARs by 1 muM ifenprodil severely impaired P19 neurite extension and fasciculation , and this negative effect was fully reversible by polyamine addition . In contrast , GABA(A)R antagonism by a high dose of 200 microM bicuculline had no observable effect on P19 neuronal differentiation and fasciculation . Except for the differential NMDAR and GABA(A)R profiles of Ca(2+) signaling within the immature P19 neurons , we have also shown that inhibition of Q9UHB4 / Q13224 NMDARs strongly decreased mRNA level of P13591 -180 , which has been previously implicated as a regulator of neuronal growth cone protrusion and neurite extension . Our data thus suggest a critical role of Q9UHB4 / Q13224 NMDARs during the process of neuritogenesis and fasciculation of P19 neurons via differential control of local growth cone Ca(2+) surges and P13591 -180 signaling .
