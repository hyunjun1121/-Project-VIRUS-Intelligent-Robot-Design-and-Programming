The clinical utility of lurasidone in schizophrenia : patient considerations . DB08815 is a novel antipsychotic agent approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in a number of countries including the United Kingdom , other European countries , the United States , and Canada . In addition to full antagonist activity at the dopamine D2 ( Ki , 1 nM ) and serotonin 5- Q13049 ( Ki , 0.5 nM ) receptors , the pharmacodynamic profile of lurasidone is notable for its high affinity for serotonin P34969 receptors ( 0.5 nM ) and its partial agonist activity at P08908 receptors ( Ki , 6.4 nM ) . Long-term treatment of schizophrenia with lurasidone has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with schizophrenia . DB08815 appears to be associated with minimal effects on body weight , and low risk for clinically meaningful alterations in glucose , lipids , or electrocardiography parameters . Evidence from two randomized trials also suggests improvement in functional capacity and cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia . A significant evidence base supports the use of lurasidone as a promising agent for the treatment of schizophrenia .
