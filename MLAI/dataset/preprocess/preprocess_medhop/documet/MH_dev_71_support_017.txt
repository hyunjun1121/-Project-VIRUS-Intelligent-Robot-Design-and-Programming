Purinergic receptors contribute to early mesangial cell transformation and renal vessel hypertrophy during angiotensin II-induced hypertension . Chronic P03950 II infusions lead to increases in intrarenal P03950 II levels , hypertension , and tissue injury . Increased blood pressure also elicits increases in renal interstitial fluid ( Q9HBH0 ) DB00171 concentrations that stimulate cell proliferation . We evaluated the contribution of purinergic receptor activation to P03950 II-induced renal injury in rats by treating with clopidogrel , a Q9H244 receptor blocker , or with PPADS , a nonselective P2 receptor blocker . alpha-Actin expression in mesangial cells , afferent arteriolar wall thickness ( AAWT ) , cortical cell proliferation , and macrophage infiltration were used as early markers of renal injury . DB00758 and PPADS did not alter blood pressure , renin or kidney P03950 II content . alpha-Actin expression increased from control of 0.6 +/- 0.4 % of mesangial area to 6.3 +/- 1.9 % in P03950 II-infused rats and this response was prevented by clopidogrel ( 0.4 +/- 0.2 % ) and PPADS . The increase in AAWT from 4.7 +/- 0.1 to 6.0 +/- 0.1 mm in P03950 II rats was also prevented by clopidogrel ( 4.8 +/- 0.1 mm ) and PPADS . P03950 II infusion led to interstitial macrophage infiltration ( 105 +/- 16 vs. 62 +/- 4 cell/mm(2) ) and tubular proliferation ( 71 +/- 15 vs. 20 +/- 4 cell/mm(2) ) and these effects were prevented by clopidogrel ( 52 +/- 4 and 36 +/- 3 cell/mm(2) ) and PPADS . Q9HBH0 DB00171 levels were higher in P03950 II-infused rats than in control rats ( 11.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.6 nmol/l , P < 0.05 ) . The results suggest that activation of vascular and glomerular purinergic P2 receptors may contribute to the mesangial cell transformation , renal inflammation , and vascular hypertrophy observed in P03950 II-dependent hypertension .
