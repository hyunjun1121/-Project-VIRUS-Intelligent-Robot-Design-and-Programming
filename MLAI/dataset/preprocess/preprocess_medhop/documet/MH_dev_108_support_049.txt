The emergence of DNA methylation as a key modulator of aberrant cell death in prostate cancer . It is now well established that cancer cells exhibit a number of genetic defects in the machinery that governs programmed cell death and that sabotage of apoptosis is one of the principal factors aiding in the evolution of the carcinogenic phenotype . A number of studies have implicated aberrant DNA methylation as a key survival mechanism in cancer , whereby promoter hypermethylation silences genes essential for many processes including apoptosis . To date , studies on the methylation profile of apoptotic genes have largely focused on cancers of the breast , colon and stomach , with only limited data available on prostate cancer . Here we discuss the major developments in the field of DNA methylation and its role in the regulation of aberrant apoptosis in prostate cancer . The most significant advances have involved the discovery of apoptotic gene targets of methylation , including Q6GPH4 , ( fragile histidine triad ( P49789 ) , cellular retinol binding protein 1 ( P09455 ) , decoy receptor 1( O14798 ) , decoy receptor 2 ( Q9UBN6 ) , target of methylation-induced silenceing 1 ( Q9ULZ3 ) , P01375 receptor superfamily , member 6 ( FAS ) , Reprimo ( Q9NS64 ) and P08151 pathogenesis-related 1 ( P48060 ) . These genes are reported to be hypermethylated in prostate cancer and some offer potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers . We also introduce the concept of an ' apoptotic methylation signature ' for prostate cancer and evaluate its potential in a diagnostic , prognostic and therapeutic setting .
