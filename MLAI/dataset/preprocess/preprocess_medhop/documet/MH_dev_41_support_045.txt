DB00087 in the treatment of refractory acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after human lung transplantation . Despite substantial improvements in early survival after lung transplantation , refractory acute rejection ( RAR ) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) remain major contributors to transplant-related morbidity and mortality . We have utilized alemtuzumab , a humanized anti- P31358 antibody which results in potent lymphocyte depletion , in consecutive patients with RAR ( n = 12 ) or BOS ( n = 10 ) . All patients failed conventional treatment with methylprednisolone and antithymocyte globulin and received strict infection prophylaxis . DB00087 significantly improved histological rejection scores in RAR . Total rejection grade/biopsy was 1.98 +/- 0.25 preceding alemtuzumab versus 0.33 +/- 0.14 posttreatment , p-value < 0.0001 ( with a similar number of biopsies/patient per respective time interval ) . Freedom from BOS was observed in 65 % of RAR patients 2 years after alemtuzumab treatment . Although there was no statistically significant change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) before and after alemtuzumab treatment in patients with BOS , a stabilization or improvement in BOS grade occurred in 70 % of patients . Patient survival 2 years after alemtuzumab for BOS was 69 % . Despite a dramatic decline in P01730 counts in alemtuzumab-treated patients , only one patient developed a lethal infection . Thus , we provide the first evidence that alemtuzumab is a potentially useful therapy in lung transplant recipients with RAR or BOS .
