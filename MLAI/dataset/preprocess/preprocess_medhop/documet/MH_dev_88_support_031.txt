Association of sixty-one non-synonymous polymorphisms in forty-one hypertension candidate genes with blood pressure variation and hypertension . We previously selected a group of hypertension candidate genes by a key word search using the OMIM database of NCBI and validated 525 coding single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 179 hypertension candidate genes by DNA sequencing in a Japanese population . In the present study , we examined the association between 61 non-synonymous SNPs and blood pressure variations and hypertension . We used DNA samples taken from 1,880 subjects in the Suita study , a population-based study using randomly selected subjects . Analyses of covariance adjusting for age , body mass index , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , smoking , drinking , and antihypertensive medication revealed that 17 polymorphisms in 16 genes ( P04114 , CAST , P51801 , O60931 , P10912 , P13807 , P08603 , O95163 , Q14654 , P11150 , P06858 , P41231 , Q15165 , P02730 , TRH , P04275 ) were significantly associated with blood pressure variations . Multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for the same factors revealed that 11 polymorphisms in 11 genes ( CAST , P16410 , P12259 , GC , P10912 , P11150 , Q13093 , P02730 , SLCI8A1 , TRH , P04275 ) showed significant associations with hypertension . Five polymorphisms in five genes , CAST(calpastatin) , P11150 ( hepatic lipase ) , P02730 ( band 3 anion transporter ) , TRH ( thyrotropin-releasing hormone ) , and P04275 ( P04275 ) , were significantly associated with both blood pressure variation and hypertension . Thus , our study suggests that these five genes were susceptibility genes for essential hypertension in this Japanese population .
