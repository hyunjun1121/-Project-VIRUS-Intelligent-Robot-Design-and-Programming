DB01045 Does not Significantly Affect the Expression of Small Heterodimer Partner in Primary Human Hepatocytes . The small/short heterodimer partner ( Q15466 , Q15466 ) is a nuclear receptor corepressor lacking a DNA binding domain . Q15466 is induced by bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) resulting in P22680 gene suppression . In contrast , O75469 ( O75469 ) activation by its ligands was recently suggested to inhibit Q15466 gene transactivation to maximize the induction of O75469 target genes . However , there are also conflicting reports in literature whether O75469 or rodent Pxr activation down-regulates Q15466 /Shp expression . Moreover , the O75469 -mediated regulation of the Q15466 gene has been studied only at the Q15466 mRNA and transactivation ( gene reporter assay ) levels . In this study , we studied the effect of rifampicin , a prototype O75469 ligand , on Q15466 mRNA , and protein expression in three primary human hepatocyte cultures . We found that Q15466 mRNA is not systematically down-regulated in hepatocyte in culture after 24 h treatment with rifampicin . Consistently , we did not observe down-regulation of Q15466 protein in primary human hepatocytes after 24 and 48 h of incubation with rifampicin . We can conclude that although we observed slight down-regulation of Q15466 mRNA and protein in several hepatocyte preparations , the phenomenon is unlikely critical for O75469 -mediated induction of its target genes .
