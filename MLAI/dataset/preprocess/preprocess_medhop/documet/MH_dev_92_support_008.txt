Three novel mutations in the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase ( O43772 ) gene in patients with O43772 deficiency and in healthy individuals . DB00583 -acylcarnitine translocase ( O43772 ) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II ( P23786 ) are key enzymes for transporting long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria . Deficiencies of these enzymes , which are clinically characterized by life-threatening non-ketotic hypoglycemia and rhabdomyolysis , can not be distinguished by acylcarnitine analysis performed using tandem mass spectrometry . We had previously reported the P23786 genetic structure and its role in P23786 deficiency . Here , we analyzed the O43772 gene in 2 patients diagnosed clinically with O43772 deficiency , 18 patients with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis and 58 healthy individuals , all of whom were confirmed to have normal P23786 genotypes . To facilitate O43772 genotyping , we used heat-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography ( DHPLC ) , which helped identify five distinct patterns . The abnormal heteroduplex fragments were subjected to O43772 -specific DNA sequencing . We found that one patient with O43772 deficiency , Case 1 , carried c.576G > A and c.199-10t > g mutations , whereas Case 2 was heterozygous for c.106-2a > t and c.576G > A . We also found that one patient with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis and one healthy individual were heterozygous for c.804delG and the synonymous mutation c.516T > C , respectively . In summary , c.576G > A , c.106-2a > t and c.516T > C are novel O43772 gene mutations . Among the five mutations identified , three were responsible for O43772 deficiency . We have also demonstrated the successful screening of O43772 mutations by DHPLC .
