Distribution of polyamines and their biosynthetic enzymes in intestinal adaptation . P11926 ( ODC ) and the polyamines have been shown to be important for growth processes in the intestinal mucosa . The highest activity of ODC is found in the differentiated , nonproliferating villus-tip cells rather than in the rapidly proliferating undifferentiated crypt cells . During poststarvation refeeding and lactation , we now show that increases in ODC activity paralleled the time course of mucosal hyperplasia and thymidine incorporation . Increases in ODC ( threefold ) were similar in villus and crypt cells , and the villus-crypt gradient of decreasing ODC activity ( 40:1 ) was maintained . The activity of the other polyamine biosynthetic enzyme , S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( P18827 ) , was highest in the crypt cells in the basal state and increased throughout the entire villus-crypt axis during refeeding and lactation , preserving a villus-crypt gradient opposite to that of ODC . During hyperplasia , all three polyamines increased . DB01917 was highest in the villus-tip cells , paralleling ODC activity , whereas spermidine and spermine were highest in the crypt cells and paralleled the distribution of P18827 activity . Thus P18827 activity and spermidine and spermine content may play a more important role than ODC and putrescine in regulation of intestinal mucosal proliferation . It is also possible that the threefold increases in the low levels of ODC in the crypt cells are adequate to trigger cell proliferation , whereas the higher ODC levels in villus cells may represent an association with the differentiation of the enterocytes .
