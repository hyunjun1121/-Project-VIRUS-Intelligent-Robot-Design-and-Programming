Chromosome 8p as a potential hub for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders : implications for schizophrenia , autism and cancer . Defects in genetic and developmental processes are thought to contribute susceptibility to autism and schizophrenia . Presumably , owing to etiological complexity identifying susceptibility genes and abnormalities in the development has been difficult . However , the importance of genes within chromosomal 8p region for neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer is well established . There are 484 annotated genes located on 8p ; many are most likely oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes . Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region ( ADRA1A , O15013 , Q15822 , Q15825 , Q05901 , Q9UBT3 , Q16555 , Q06889 , O60258 , Q9NP95 , P11362 , FZD3 , LDL , NAT2 , P07197 , Q02297 , PCM1 , P00750 , P48454 , Q8N474 and P54219 / P54219 ) that are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders ( schizophrenia , autism , bipolar disorder and depression ) , neurodegenerative disorders ( Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease ) and cancer . Furthermore , at least seven nonprotein-coding RNAs ( microRNAs ) are located at 8p . Structural variants on 8p , such as copy number variants , microdeletions or microduplications , might also contribute to autism , schizophrenia and other human diseases including cancer . In this review , we consider the current state of evidence from cytogenetic , linkage , association , gene expression and endophenotyping studies for the role of these 8p genes in neuropsychiatric disease . We also describe how a mutation in an 8p gene ( Fgf17 ) results in a mouse with deficits in specific components of social behavior and a reduction in its dorsomedial prefrontal cortex . We finish by discussing the biological connections of 8p with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer , despite the shortcomings of this evidence .
