Expression of ras proto-oncogenes in the Dunning R3327 rat prostatic adenocarcinoma system . Steady-state levels of c-Ha-ras mRNA were measured in eight sublines of the Dunning R3327 rat prostatic adenocarcinoma . As a control , normal dorsal prostate tissue was studied . Increased expression of c-Ha-ras is associated with tumor progression in one lineage of the Dunning R3327 system ( H to AT1 to P24752 -Lu and P24752 -Ly-Lu ) . Here ras mRNA increases as the tumor advances from androgen dependence and a high degree of differentiation to an anaplastic aneuploid phenotype with high metastatic potential . However , in the other Dunning lineage ( H to HI to HI-F to P01008 ) , expression of c-Ha-ras is variable and does not correlate with tumor progression . Immunocytochemistry showed that levels of the c-Ha-ras P38936 protein paralleled steady-state mRNA levels in variants . Transfection assays , using NIH/3T3 cells , suggested that the ras loci were not activated in the R3327 tumors . Levels of P01116 mRNA were also measured in the Dunning tumors ; these did not correlate with tumor progression in either lineage . Expression of N-ras mRNA was not detected in the Dunning tumors .
