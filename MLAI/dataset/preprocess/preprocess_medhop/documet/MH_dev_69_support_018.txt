DB01235 -treatment in primates disrupts the expression of A(2A) adenosine-CB(1) cannabinoid- P14416 heteromers in the caudate nucleus . The molecular basis of priming for DB01235 -induced dyskinesias in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , which depends on the indirect pathway of motor control , is not known . In rodents , the indirect pathway contains striatopallidal GABAergic neurons that express heterotrimers composed of A(2A) adenosine , CB(1) cannabinoid and D(2) dopamine receptors that regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission . The present study was designed to investigate the expression of these heteromers in the striatum of a primate model of Parkinson 's disease and to determine whether their expression and pharmacological properties are altered upon DB01235 treatment . By using the recently developed in situ proximity ligation assay and by identification of a biochemical fingerprint , we discovered a regional distribution of A(2A)/CB(1) /D(2) receptor heteromers that predicts differential D(2)-mediated neurotransmission in the caudate-putamen of Macaca fascicularis . Whereas heteromers were abundant in the caudate nucleus of both na√Øve and MPTP-treated monkeys , DB01235 treatment blunted the biochemical fingerprint and led to weak heteromer expression . These findings constitute the first evidence of altered receptor heteromer expression in pathological conditions and suggest that drugs targeting A(2A)-CB(1) -D(2) receptor heteromers may be successful to either normalize basal ganglia output or prevent DB01235 -induced side effects .
