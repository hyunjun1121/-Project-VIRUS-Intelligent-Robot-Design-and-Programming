Knockdown endogenous CypA with siRNA in U2OS cells results in disruption of F-actin structure and alters tumor phenotype . P62937 ( CypA ) was originally identified as a cytosolic protein possessing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity . CypA has been shown to play a pivotal role in the immune response , but little is known about other molecular mechanisms of CypA-mediated biologic events . In our present study , we demonstrate that knockdown CypA expression using RNAi in U2OS cells resulted in disruption of the F-actin structure , as well as decreased anchorage-independent growth , proliferation , and migration . Wild-type U2OS cells treated with cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitor , displayed the same phenotype as knockdown CypA cells , suggesting that the isomerase activity of CypA is required to maintain a normal phenotype . In vitro and in vivo binding assays revealed that CypA binds to O00401 , which functions in the nucleation of actin via the Arp2/3 complex . Pulse-chase labeling study indicated an enhanced degradation of O00401 in cell lacking CypA , suggesting that CypA is required for stabilizing O00401 to form a O00401 /Arp2/3 complex for the nucleation/initiation of F-actin polymerization .
