Clinical endocannabinoid deficiency ( CECD ) : can this concept explain therapeutic benefits of cannabis in migraine , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome and other treatment-resistant conditions ? OBJECTIVES : This study examines the concept of clinical endocannabinoid deficiency ( CECD ) , and the prospect that it could underlie the pathophysiology of migraine , fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , and other functional conditions alleviated by clinical cannabis . METHODS : Available literature was reviewed , and literature searches pursued via the National Library of Medicine database and other resources . RESULTS : Migraine has numerous relationships to endocannabinoid function . Anandamide ( AEA ) potentiates P08908 and inhibits 5- Q13049 receptors supporting therapeutic efficacy in acute and preventive migraine treatment . Cannabinoids also demonstrate dopamine-blocking and anti-inflammatory effects . AEA is tonically active in the periaqueductal gray matter , a migraine generator . THC modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission via DB01221 receptors . Fibromyalgia is now conceived as a central sensitization state with secondary hyperalgesia . Cannabinoids have similarly demonstrated the ability to block spinal , peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in headache , fibromyalgia , IBS and related disorders . The past and potential clinical utility of cannabis-based medicines in their treatment is discussed , as are further suggestions for experimental investigation of CECD via P04141 examination and neuro-imaging . CONCLUSION : Migraine , fibromyalgia , IBS and related conditions display common clinical , biochemical and pathophysiological patterns that suggest an underlying clinical endocannabinoid deficiency that may be suitably treated with cannabinoid medicines .
