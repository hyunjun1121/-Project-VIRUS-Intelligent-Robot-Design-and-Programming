Exenatide does not evoke pancreatitis and attenuates chemically induced pancreatitis in normal and diabetic rodents . The risk of developing pancreatitis is elevated in type 2 diabetes and obesity . Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in type 2 diabetes patients treated with P0C6A0 ( P43220 ) receptor agonists . To examine whether the P43220 agonist exenatide potentially induces or modulates pancreatitis , the effect of exenatide was evaluated in normal or diabetic rodents . Normal and diabetic rats received a single exenatide dose ( 0.072 , 0.24 , and 0.72 nmol/kg ) or vehicle . Diabetic ob/ob or HF- Q11206 mice were infused with exenatide ( 1.2 and 7.2 nmol·kg(-1)·day(-1) ) or vehicle for 4 wk . Post-exenatide treatment , pancreatitis was induced with caerulein ( CRN ) or sodium taurocholate ( ST ) , and changes in plasma amylase and lipase were measured . In ob/ob mice , plasma cytokines ( IL-1β , P60568 , P05231 , P13500 , IFNγ , and TNFα ) and pancreatitis-associated genes were assessed . Pancreata were weighed and examined histologically . Exenatide treatment alone did not modify plasma amylase or lipase in any models tested . Exenatide attenuated CRN-induced release of amylase and lipase in normal rats and ob/ob mice but did not modify the response to ST infusion . Plasma cytokines and pancreatic weight were unaffected by exenatide . Exenatide upregulated Reg3b but not Il6 , Ccl2 , Nfkb1 , or Vamp8 expression . Histological analysis revealed that the highest doses of exenatide decreased CRN- or ST-induced acute inflammation , vacuolation , and acinar single cell necrosis in mice and rats , respectively . Ductal cell proliferation rates were low and similar across all groups of ob/ob mice . In conclusion , exenatide did not modify plasma amylase and lipase concentrations in rodents without pancreatitis and improved chemically induced pancreatitis in normal and diabetic rodents .
