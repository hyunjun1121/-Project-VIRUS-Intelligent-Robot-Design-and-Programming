DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically cause ubiquitinated protein accumulation in prostate cancer cells . PURPOSE : Protein ubiquitination is a novel strategy used to treat malignancies . We investigated whether the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , Michigan ) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( LC Laboratories , Woburn , Massachusetts ) would synergistically cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in prostate cancer cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : LNCaP , PC-3 and DU 145 cells ( ATCCâ„¢ ) were treated with vorinostat and/or bortezomib . Cell viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed . In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine subcutaneous tumor model using PC-3 cells . The influence of androgen receptor expression on bortezomib efficacy was examined using RNA interference . Changes in the expression of ubiquitinated proteins , cell cycle associated proteins and acetylated histone were evaluated . RESULTS : P10275 expression seemed to decrease bortezomib activity . PC-3 and DU 145 cells were more susceptible to bortezomib than LNCaP cells and the silencing of androgen receptor expression in LNCaP cells enhanced bortezomib activity . DB02546 and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis , inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and suppressed tumor growth in a murine xenograft model . The combination decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression , and increased P38936 expression . The combination synergistically caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and histone acetylation . This histone acetylation was a consequence of the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins . CONCLUSIONS : DB02546 and bortezomib inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells synergistically by causing ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate in cells . The current study provides a framework for testing the combination in patients with advanced prostate cancer .
