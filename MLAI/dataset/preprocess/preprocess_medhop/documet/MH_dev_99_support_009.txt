Alzheimer 's disease and modern lifestyle : what is the role of stress ? This Editorial highlights a study by Baglietto-Vargas et al. 2015 published in this issue of J. Neurochem . Stress is one of the environmental factors that can contribute to Alzheimer 's disease pathogenesis . However , the role of modern-life stress has not been investigated yet . The authors reveal that modern-life stress reduces the number of dendritic spines in the hippocampus of Alzheimer 's disease transgenic mice . The mechanism underlying such effect involves an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) release that stimulates the amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) processing and fosters the generation of Amyloid-Î² , which negatively affects dendritic spines .
