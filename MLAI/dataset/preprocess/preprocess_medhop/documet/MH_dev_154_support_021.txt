Differential inhibition of soluble and cell surface receptor-bound single-chain urokinase by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 . A potential regulatory mechanism . DB00013 ( u-PA ) -mediated cell surface plasminogen activation is required for cellular tissue invasion . This invasion occurs in environments rich in plasminogen activator inhibitors ( PAIs ) , which efficiently inhibit receptor-bound two-chain u-PA . Single-chain u-PA ( scu-PA ) was recently found to efficiently initiate cell surface plasminogen activation , and we herein describe the interaction of scu-PA with P05121 type 2 ( P05120 ) . In the fluid phase ( no cells ) the plasminogen-activating activities of both scu-PA and Glu158-scu-PA ( a plasmin non-activatable variant of scu-PA ) were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by recombinant human P05120 . This inhibition occurred with both forms of scu-PA remaining as single-chain molecules throughout the interactions . Although scu-PA did not form SDS-stable complexes with P05120 , preincubation of scu-PA with 125I- P05120 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of SDS-stable complex formation between 125I- P05120 and subsequently added two-chain u-PA . This indicates that although a " stable intermediate " type complex between scu-PA and P05120 was not detected , there was a physical association between the two molecules that shared at least some determinants with the two-chain u-PA- P05120 complex . In contrast , Glu158-scu-PA bound to u-PA receptors on monocytes was only minimally inhibited by a large molar excess of P05120 . These data suggest that the initiation of cell surface plasminogen activation may involve the partitioning of scu-PA between P05120 ( a " negative modulator " ) and the u-PA receptor ( a " positive modulator " ) and that the enzymatic activity of receptor-bound scu-PA may allow initiation of cell surface proteolysis even in P05120 -rich environments . A model along these lines is presented .
