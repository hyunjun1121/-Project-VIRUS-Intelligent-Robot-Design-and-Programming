Comparison of effects of olmesartan and telmisartan on blood pressure and metabolic parameters in Japanese early-stage type-2 diabetics with hypertension . P30556 blockers ( ARBs ) are regarded as first-line treatments for type-2 diabetes with hypertension . Despite the availability of various types of ARBs , there are no comparative studies of their effects on patients with diabetes . In this open-label prospective crossover study , we compared the effects of olmesartan ( 20 mg/day ) and telmisartan ( 40 mg/day ) . Twenty Japanese early-stage type-2 diabetes patients with hypertension treated with valsartan ( 80 mg/day ) for at least 8 weeks were recruited to this study . At study entry , valsartan was changed to olmesartan ( 20 mg/day ) or telmisartan ( 40 mg/day ) and administered for 8 weeks . The drugs were then switched and treatment was continued for another 8 weeks . We analyzed the blood pressure lowering effects of each drug by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 0 , 8 , and 16 weeks . Simultaneously , we measured metabolic parameters and inflammation markers . DB00275 lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure more significantly than did telmisartan . While there were no differences between the groups in metabolic parameters , including HbA1c and adiponectin , the decreases in serum interleukin-6 and highly sensitive P02741 were more significant by olmesartan treatment . Our results indicate that olmesartan has more potent arterial blood pressure lowering and anti-inflammatory effects than telmisartan .
