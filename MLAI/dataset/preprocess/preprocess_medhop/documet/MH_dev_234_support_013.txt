Discovery of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , CR229 , using structurebased drug screening . To generate new scaffold candidates as highly selective and potent cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors , structure-based drug screening was performed utilizing 3D pharmacophore conformations of known potent inhibitors . As a result , CR229 ( 6-bromo-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-carbolin-1-one ) was generated as the hit-compound . A computational docking study using the X-ray crystallographic structure of P24941 in complex with CR229 was evaluated . This predicted binding mode study of CR229 with P24941 demonstrated that CR229 interacted effectively with the Leu83 and Glu81 residues in the DB00171 -binding pocket of P24941 for the possible hydrogen bond formation . Furthermore , biochemical studies on inhibitory effects of CR229 on various kinases in the human cervical cancer HeLa cells demonstrated that CR229 was a potent inhibitor of P24941 ( IC50 : 3 microM ) , P06493 ( IC50 : 4.9 microM ) , and P11802 ( IC50 : 3 microM ) , yet had much less inhibitory effect ( IC50 : > 20 microM ) on other kinases , such as casein kinase P35326 ( CK2- alpha1 ) , protein kinase A ( PKA ) , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Accordingly , these data demonstrate that CR229 is a potent CDK inhibitor with anticancer efficacy .
