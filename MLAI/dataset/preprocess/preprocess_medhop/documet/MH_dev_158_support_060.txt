The H1 histamine receptor regulates allergic lung responses . DB11320 , signaling via the type 1 receptor ( P35367 ) , has been shown to suppress Th2 cytokine production by in vitro cultured T cells . We examined the role of P35367 in allergic inflammation in vivo using a murine asthma model . Allergen-stimulated splenic T cells from sensitized P35367 -/- mice exhibited enhanced Th2 cytokine production . Despite this Th2 bias , allergen-challenged P35367 -/- mice exhibited diminished lung Th2 cytokine mRNA levels , airway inflammation , goblet cell metaplasia , and airway hyperresponsiveness ( P35869 ) . Restoration of pulmonary Th2 cytokines in P35367 -/- mice by intranasal P05112 or P35225 restored inflammatory lung responses and P35869 . Further investigation revealed that histamine acts as a T cell chemotactic factor and defective T cell trafficking was responsible for the absence of lung inflammation . Cultured T cells migrated in response to histamine in vitro , but this was ablated by blockade of P35367 but not P25021 . In vivo , allergen-specific WT but not P35367 -/- P01730 + T cells were recruited to the lungs of naive recipients following inhaled allergen challenge . P35367 -/- T cells failed to confer airway inflammation or P35869 observed after transfer of WT T cells . Our data establish a role for histamine and P35367 in promoting the migration of Th2 cells into sites of allergen exposure .
