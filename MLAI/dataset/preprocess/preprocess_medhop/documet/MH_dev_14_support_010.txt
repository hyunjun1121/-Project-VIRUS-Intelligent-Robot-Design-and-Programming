Zeranol upregulates corticotropin releasing hormone expression in the placental cell line JEG-3 . DB01285 -releasing hormone ( P06850 ) plays a pivotal role in the control of parturition in human . Increased amount of plasma P06850 is associated with pre-mature delivery . Zeranol or α-zearalanol is a mycotoxin produced by fungi in the Fusarium family . Unlike other mycotoxins , exposure to zeranol appears to have minimal health risk . In North America , it is used as a growth-promoting agent in livestock . Because of the health concern of zeranol residue in meat , this practice has not been adopted in Europe . In our study zeranol could induce P06850 protein expression in JEG-3 cells as low as 0.1nM . As electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated an increase in the CRE binding activity in P06850 promoter , the induction was likely triggered by transcriptional regulation . We further looked into the signal transduction pathway and PKCδ and P27361 /2 were found to be activated . This study showed that zeranol could increase P06850 expression in placental cells , and the findings might be a concern for pregnant women .
