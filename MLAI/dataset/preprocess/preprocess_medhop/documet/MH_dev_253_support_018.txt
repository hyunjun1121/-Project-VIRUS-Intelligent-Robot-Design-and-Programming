p62 links β-adrenergic input to mitochondrial function and thermogenesis . The scaffold protein p62 ( sequestosome 1 ; Q13501 ) is an emerging key molecular link among the metabolic , immune , and proliferative processes of the cell . Here , we report that adipocyte-specific , but not CNS- , liver- , muscle- , or myeloid-specific p62-deficient mice are obese and exhibit a decreased metabolic rate caused by impaired nonshivering thermogenesis . Our results show that p62 regulates energy metabolism via control of mitochondrial function in brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) . Accordingly , adipocyte-specific p62 deficiency led to impaired mitochondrial function , causing Q14032 to become unresponsive to β-adrenergic stimuli . Ablation of p62 leads to decreased activation of p38 targets , affecting signaling molecules that control mitochondrial function , such as P15336 , CREB , PGC1α , Q92813 , NRF1 , CYTC , P35354 , ATP5β , and P25874 . p62 ablation in HIB1B and Q14032 primary cells demonstrated that p62 controls thermogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner , independently of brown adipocyte development or differentiation . Together , our data identify p62 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial function and brown fat thermogenesis .
