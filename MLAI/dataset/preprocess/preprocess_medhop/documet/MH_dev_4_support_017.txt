Differential display RT-PCR reveals genes associated with lithium-induced neuritogenesis in SK-N-MC cells . DB01356 is shown to be neurotrophic and protective against variety of environmental stresses both in vitro as well as in vivo . In view of the wider clinical applications , it is necessary to examine alterations in levels of expression of genes affected by lithium . DB01356 induces neuritogenesis in human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC . Our aim was to elucidate genes involved in lithium-induced neuritogenesis using SK-N-MC cells . The differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( DD-RT-PCR ) technique was used to study gene expression profiles in SK-N-MC cells undergoing lithium-induced neuritogenesis . Differential expression of genes in control and lithium ( 2.5 mM , 24 h ) -treated cells was compared by display of cDNAs generated by reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR using arbitrary primers . Expression of four genes was altered in lithium-treated cells . Real-time PCR was done to confirm the levels of expression of each of these genes using specific primers . DB01356 significantly up-regulated P13591 , a molecule known to stimulate neuritogenesis , occludin , a molecule participating in tight junctions and PKD2 , a molecule known to modulate calcium transport . P01160 32c , a gene whose function is not fully known yet , was found to be down-regulated by lithium . This is the first report demonstrating altered levels of expression of these genes in lithium-induced neuritogenesis and contributes four hitherto unreported candidates possibly involved in the process .
