Decreased mitochondrial carnitine translocase in skeletal muscles impairs utilization of fatty acids in insulin-resistant patients . P01308 resistance ( IR ) and its health consequences ( diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , obesity etc. ) affect between 25 and 35 % of Westernized populations . Decreased fatty acid ( FA ) oxidation in skeletal muscle is implicated in obesity-related IR . DB00583 -acylcarnitine translocase ( O43772 ) transports long-chain FAs both into mitochondria ( as carnitine esters for energy-generating processes ) and out of mitochondria . To determine whether O43772 activity correlates with decreased FA oxidation we measured O43772 concentrations in cellular and mitochondrial extracts from the skeletal muscle of 19 obese IR individuals and of 19 lean controls . We also evaluated carnitine transport in skeletal muscle mitochondria in both groups . Mitochondrial O43772 was decreased at translational and transductional level , and carnitine-carnitine and acylcarnitine-carnitine exchange rates were significantly lower in IR subjects . Aberrant acylcarnitine flux into mitochondria was not correlated with decreased activity of other components of the mitochondrial carnitine system ( i.e. , carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I and II ) . Our data suggest that by restraining entry of FA-coenzyme A into mitochondria , low O43772 levels increase cytosolic FA levels and their incorporation into glycerolipids . The low level of O43772 in IR muscle may contribute to the elevated muscle concentrations of triglycerides , diacylglycerol , and FA-coenzyme A characteristic of IR muscle .
