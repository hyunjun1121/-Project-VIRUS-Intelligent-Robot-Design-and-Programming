Serotonin transporter interacts with the PDGFβ receptor in DB00102 -induced signaling and mitogenesis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells . The serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) have been implicated in both clinical and experimental pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) and the facilitation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell ( PASMC ) growth . To gain a better understanding of the possible relationship of these two cell surface molecules we have explored interactions between P31645 and P09619 . We have previously demonstrated that P31645 transactivates PDGFRβ in serotonin-stimulated PASMC proliferation . We now provide evidence for a role for P31645 in DB00102 signaling and PASMC proliferation by using pharmacological inhibitors , genetic ablation , and construct overexpression of P31645 . The results show that four tested P31645 blockers dose dependently inhibit PDGF-stimulated human and bovine PASMC proliferation with comparable efficacy to that of P09619 inhibitors , whereas P28222 or 5- Q13049 receptor inhibitors had no effect . Combinations of the P31645 and P09619 inhibitors led to synergistic/additive inhibition . Similarly , PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation was attenuated by small interfering RNA downregulation of P31645 . Inhibition of P31645 in PASMCs attenuated PDGF-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ , Akt , and p38 but not Erk . Overexpression of P31645 in HEK293 cells led to enhanced Akt phosphorylation by PDGF , which was blunted by a P31645 PDZ motif mutant , indicating the mechanistic need for the PDZ motif of P31645 in PDGF signaling . Furthermore , coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that P31645 and PDGFRβ become physically associated upon PDGF stimulation . In total , the data show for the first time an important interactive relationship between P31645 and the PDGFRβ in the production of PASMC proliferation triggered by PDGF that may be important in PH .
