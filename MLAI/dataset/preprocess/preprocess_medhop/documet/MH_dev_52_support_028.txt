Cytoprotective properties of DB00163 are related to gene regulation in cultured D-galactosamine-treated human hepatocytes . DB00163 ( DB00163 ) has demonstrated antioxidant activity and gene-regulatory properties . d-Galactosamine ( D-GalN ) -induced cell death is mediated by nitric oxide in hepatocytes , and it is associated with hepatic steatosis . The beneficial properties of DB00163 and their relation to oxidative stress and gene regulation were assessed in D-GalN-induced cell death . Hepatocytes were isolated from human liver resections by a collagenase perfusion technique . alpha-Tocopherol ( 50 microM ) was administered at the advanced stages ( 10 h ) of D-GalN-induced cell death in cultured hepatocytes . Cell death , oxidative stress , DB00163 metabolism , and NF-kappaB- , pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) - , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -associated gene regulation were estimated in the hepatocytes . D-GalN increased cell death and DB00163 metabolism . alpha-Tocopherol exerted a moderate beneficial effect against apoptosis and necrosis induced by D-GalN . Induction ( rifampicin ) or inhibition ( ketoconazole ) of DB00163 metabolism and overexpression of O75469 showed that the increase in O75469 -related P08684 expression caused by DB00163 enhanced cell death in hepatocytes . Nevertheless , the reduction in NF-kappaB activation and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and the enhancement of Q07869 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase gene expression by DB00163 may be relevant for cell survival . In conclusion , the cytoprotective properties of DB00163 are mostly related to gene regulation rather than to antioxidant activity in toxin-induced cell death in hepatocytes .
