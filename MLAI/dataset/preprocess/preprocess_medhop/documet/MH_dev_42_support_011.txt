Potential role of activated platelets in homing of human endothelial progenitor cells to subendothelial matrix . Endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) mobilize from the bone marrow in response to tissue injury and participate in vascular repair . However , there is limited data about the homing mechanisms of EPCs to vascular injury sites . Recently animal experiments indicated that platelets play a role in recruitment of EPCs to injury sites . However , data on the possible interaction between platelets and EPCs within the human system are limited . We , therefore , examined in-vitro human platelet-EPC interaction under static and flow conditions . Human EPCs were isolated from donated buffy coats by magnetic microbeads and flow cytometry cell sorting using CD133 and P35968 , respectively , as markers . Platelets were tested in the form of washed platelets , platelet rich plasma or whole blood . EPCs formed heterotypic aggregates with resting platelets under static conditions , an interaction that was greatly enhanced when platelets were activated by collagen , ADP or thrombin-activation peptide . The platelet-EPC interaction was inhibited by antibodies to P16109 or P16109 glycoprotein ligand-1 ( Q14242 ) , but not by antibodies to glycoproteins Ib-IX-V or IIb/IIIa . When perfused over activated platelets under shear stress of 2.5 dyn/cm(2) , EPCs tethered to platelayers and either adhered immediately or rolled a short distance before adhering . In addition , platelets promoted the colonization of adherent EPCs in culture conditions . Consistent with recent animal studies , these findings demonstrate that human EPCs interact in vitro with activated platelets under static and flow conditions , mediated through P16109 - Q14242 interaction . This interaction may be a central mechanism for homing of EPCs to vascular injury sites .
