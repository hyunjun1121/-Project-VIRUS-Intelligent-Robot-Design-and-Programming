A pyrazole curcumin derivative restores membrane homeostasis disrupted after brain trauma . We have assessed potential mechanisms associated with the deleterious effects of TBI on the integrity of plasma membranes in the hippocampus , together with consequences for behavioral function . In addition , we have investigated the efficacy of a dietary intervention based on a pyrazole curcumin derivative with demonstrated bioactivity and brain absorption , to re-establish membrane integrity . We report that moderate fluid percussion injury ( FPI ) increases levels of 4-Hydroxynonenal ( HNE ) , an intermediary for the harmful effects of lipid peroxidation on neurons . A more direct action of FPI on membrane homeostasis was evidenced by a reduction in calcium-independent phospholipase A2 ( iPLAâ‚‚ ) important for metabolism of membrane phospholipids such as DB01708 , and an increase in the fatty acid transport protein ( FATP ) involved in translocation of long-chain fatty acids across the membrane . A potential association between membrane disruption and neuronal function was suggested by reduced levels of the Q13224 subunit of the transmembrane DB01221 receptor , in association with changes in iPLA2 and syntaxin-3 ( Q92186 -3 , involved in the action of membrane DB01708 on synaptic membrane expansion ) . In addition , changes in iPLA2 , 4-HNE , and Q92186 -3 were proportional to reduced performance in a spatial learning task . In turn , the dietary supplementation with the curcumin derivative counteracted all the effects of FPI , effectively restoring parameters of membrane homeostasis . Results show the potential of the curcumin derivative to promote membrane homeostasis following TBI , which may foster a new line of non-invasive therapeutic treatments for TBI patients by endogenous up-regulation of molecules important for neural repair and plasticity .
