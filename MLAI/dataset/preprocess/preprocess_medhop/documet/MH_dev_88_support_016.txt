Neuronal death by oxidative stress involves activation of O43524 through a two-arm pathway that activates stress kinases and attenuates insulin-like growth factor I signaling . Oxidative stress kills neurons by stimulating O43524 , a transcription factor whose activity is inhibited by insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) , a wide-spectrum neurotrophic signal . Because recent evidence has shown that oxidative stress blocks neuroprotection by P05019 , we examined whether attenuation of P05019 signaling is linked to neuronal death by oxidative stress , as both events may contribute to neurodegeneration . We observed that in neurons , activation of O43524 by a burst of oxidative stress elicited by 50 muM hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) ) recruited a two-pronged pathway . A first , rapid arm attenuated AKT inhibition of O43524 through p38 MAPK-mediated blockade of P05019 stimulation of AKT . A second delayed arm involved activation of O43524 by Jun-kinase 2 ( P45984 ) . Notably , blockade of P05019 signaling through p38 MAPK was necessary for P45984 to activate O43524 , unveiling a competitive regulatory interplay between the two arms onto O43524 activity . Therefore , an abrupt rise in oxidative stress activates p38 MAPK to tilt the balance in a competitive AKT/ P45984 regulation of O43524 toward its activation , eventually leading to neuronal death . In view of previous observations linking attenuation of P05019 signaling to other causes of neuronal death , these findings suggest that blockade of trophic input is a common step in neuronal death .
