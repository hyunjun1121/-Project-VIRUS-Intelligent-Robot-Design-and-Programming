P14210 induces anoikis resistance by up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in uterine endometrial cancer cells . P35354 ( P35354 ) has been implicated in the promotion of carcinogenesis . Although the role of P35354 in endometrial cancer remains unclear , recent experiments suggest that P35354 antagonizes cell apoptosis , increases the invasiveness of malignant cells , and promotes angiogenesis . P14210 ( P14210 ) is a mesenchymal-derived cytokine and the interaction between P14210 and its tyrosine kinase receptor , c- DB00134 proto-oncogene , is associated with tumor progression and metastasis . To investigate the molecular mechanism of P14210 -induced anoikis resistance , we analyzed the signal transduction and P35354 expression in endometrial cancer cells . Here , we show i ) the expression of P35354 protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after P14210 stimulation in endometrial cancer cell lines ( O14777 -IB and RL95-2 ) , reaching 200-270 % stimulation at the highest doses of P14210 tested ( 40 ng/ml ) ; ii ) flow cytometry and TUNEL analyses revealed that P14210 significantly inhibited anoikis of RL95-2 cells ; iii ) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor ( LY294002 ) , but not mitogen-activated protein kinase/ P29323 kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor ( PD98059 ) , specifically blocked P14210 -mediated anoikis resistance in RL95-2 cells ; and iv ) P35354 inhibitor , Meloxicam , abrogated P14210 -mediated anoikis resistance . Our data suggest that P14210 induces anoikis resistance in endometrial cancer cells possibly through PI3K/Akt pathway-dependent up-regulation of P35354 expression .
