P38398 transcriptionally regulates genes involved in breast tumorigenesis . Loss of function of P38398 caused by inherited mutation and tissue-specific somatic mutation leads to breast and ovarian cancer . Nearly all P38398 germ-line mutations involve truncation or loss of the C-terminal BRCT transcriptional activation domain , suggesting that transcriptional regulation is a critical function of the wild-type gene . The purpose of this project was to determine whether there is a link between the role of P38398 in transcriptional regulation and its role in tumor suppression . We developed a cell line ( in which P38398 can be induced ) and used microarray analysis to compare transcription profiles of epithelial cells with low endogenous levels of P38398 vs. transcription profiles of cells with 2-4-fold higher induced levels of expression of P38398 . At these levels of expression , P38398 did not induce apoptosis . Undirected cluster analysis of six paired experiments revealed 373 genes , the expression of which was altered significantly and consistently by P38398 induction . Expression of 62 genes was altered more than 2-fold . P38398 -regulated genes associated with breast tumorigenesis included the estrogen-responsive genes MYC and cyclin D1 , which are overexpressed in many breast tumors ; P42224 and P23458 , key components of the cytokine signal transduction pathway ; the extracellular matrix protein laminin 3A ; P47928 , an inhibitor of DNA-binding transcriptional activators , which in turn negatively regulates P38398 expression ; and the prohormone stanniocalcin , expression of which is lost in breast tumor cells . Coordinated expression of P38398 with P47928 and with stanniocalcin was confirmed in primary breast and ovarian tumors .
