Antiinflammatory steroid action in human ovarian surface epithelial cells . The human ovarian surface epithelium ( OSE ) is subject to serial injury and repair during ovulation , which is a natural inflammatory event . We asked whether there is a compensatory antiinflammatory component to this process , involving steroid hormones produced locally at the time of ovulation . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from cultured human OSE cell monolayers showed that exposure to proinflammatory IL1alpha ( 500 pg/ml ) increased mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) ( P < 0.01 ) at 48 h . The P35354 mRNA response to IL1alpha was associated with an approximate 18-fold ( P < 0.01 ) increase in mRNA levels of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11betaHSD1 ) , encoding the steroid dehydrogenase that reversibly reduces cortisone to antiinflammatory cortisol . Addition of cortisol to OSE cell culture medium dose-dependently suppressed the P35354 mRNA response to IL1alpha ( P < 0.01 ) but reciprocally enhanced the 11betaHSD1 mRNA response ( P < 0.05 ) , with both effects strongest at 1 microm cortisol . Presence of glucocorticoid receptor-alpha mRNA and protein was established in OSE cell monolayers and treatment with IL1alpha shown to significantly up-regulate the glucocorticoid receptor-alpha mRNA level ( P < 0.05 ) . P04150 antagonist ( DB00834 , 10 microm ) fully reversed the inhibitory effect of 1 microm cortisol on IL1alpha-stimulated P35354 mRNA expression . Progesterone also suppressed IL1alpha-induced P35354 mRNA expression but had no significant effect on IL1alpha-stimulated 11betaHSD1 expression . These data provide direct evidence for antiinflammatory actions of cortisol and progesterone in human OSE cells .
