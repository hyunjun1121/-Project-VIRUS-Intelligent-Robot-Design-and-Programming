Prevention of airway inflammation with topical cream containing imiquimod and small interfering RNA for natriuretic peptide receptor . BACKGROUND : Asthma is a complex disease , characterized by reversible airway obstruction , hyperresponsiveness and chronic inflammation . Principle pharmacologic treatments for asthma include bronchodilating beta2-agonists and anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroids ; but these agents do not target the main cause of the disease , the generation of pathogenic Th2 cells . We previously reported reduction in allergic inflammation in mice deficient in the P01160 receptor NPRA . Here we determined whether siRNA for natriuretic peptide receptor A ( siNPRA ) protected against asthma when administered transdermally . METHODS : Imiquimod cream mixed with chitosan nanoparticles containing either siRNA green indicator ( siGLO ) or siNPRA was applied to the skin of mice . Delivery of siGLO was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy . The anti-inflammatory activity of transdermal siNPRA was tested in OVA-sensitized mice by measuring airway hyperresponsiveness , eosinophilia , lung histopathology and pro-inflammatory cytokines . RESULTS : SiGLO appearing in the lung proved the feasibility of transdermal delivery . In a mouse asthma model , BALB/c mice treated with imiquimod cream containing siNPRA chitosan nanoparticles showed significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness , eosinophilia , lung histopathology and pro-inflammatory cytokines P05112 and P05113 in lung homogenates compared to controls . CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate that topical cream containing imiquimod and siNPRA nanoparticles exerts an anti-inflammatory effect and may provide a new and simple therapy for asthma .
