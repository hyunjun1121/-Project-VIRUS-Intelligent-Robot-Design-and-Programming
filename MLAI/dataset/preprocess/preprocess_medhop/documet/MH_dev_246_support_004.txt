Prominence of central sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 in attenuating aβ-induced injury by fingolimod . FTY720 ( fingolimod ) , the sphingosine-1-phosphate ( Q14703 ) analogue , has been experimentally indicated to exert substantial ameliorating effects in animal models of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The present work aims to answer whether central P21453 ( P21453 ) plays significant role in the impact of fingolimod in AD . To verify the prominence of central FTY720 phosphorylation , DMS ( sphingosine kinase inhibitor ) was infused intracerebrally in parallel with systemic FTY720 administration to prevent central formation of FTY720-P as the recognized active ligand for S1PRs . The corresponding P21453 modulation was also investigated using the pharmacological blockage of central P21453 by W123 . Both DMS and W123 were efficiently capable of suppressing FTY720-ameliorating effects in AD animals , either on memory deficit or on P36551 -II and P01375 -α expression . Our data conclude that experimental benefits of FTY720 in the context of AD depend on central P21453 modulation , as well as on Q14703 kinase activity in the brain .
