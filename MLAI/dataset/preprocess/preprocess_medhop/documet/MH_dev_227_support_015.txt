Inducible raptor and rictor knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts . The mammalian Target of DB00877 ( P42345 ) kinase functions within two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes termed P42345 complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and mTORC2 . The immunosuppressant and anticancer drug rapamycin is commonly used in basic research as a tool to study P42345 signaling . However , rapamycin inhibits only , and only incompletely , mTORC1 , and no mTORC2-specific inhibitor is available . Hence , a full understanding of P42345 signaling in vivo , including the function of both complexes , requires genetic inhibition in addition to pharmacological inhibition . Taking advantage of the Cre/LoxP system , we generated inducible knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) deficient for either the mTORC1-specific component raptor ( iRapKO ) or the mTORC2-specific component rictor ( iRicKO ) . Inducibility of the knockout was important because P42345 complex components are essential . Induction of either raptor or rictor knockout eliminated raptor or rictor expression , respectively , and impaired the corresponding P42345 signaling branch . The described knockout MEFs are a valuable tool to study the full function of the two P42345 complexes individually .
