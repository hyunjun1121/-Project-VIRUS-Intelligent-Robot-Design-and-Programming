Binding of antipsychotic drugs to human brain receptors focus on newer generation compounds . Using radioligand binding assays and post-mortem normal human brain tissue , we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants ( K(d)s ) for nine new antipsychotic drugs ( iloperidone , melperone , olanzapine , ORG 5222 , quetiapine , risperidone , sertindole , ziprasidone , and zotepine ) , one metabolite of a new drug ( 9-OH-risperidone ) , and three older antipsychotics ( clozapine , haloperidol , and pimozide ) at nine different receptors ( alpha1-adrenergic , alpha2-adrenergic , dopamine D2 , histamine H1 , muscarinic , and serotonin P08908 , P28221 , 5- Q13049 , and P28335 receptors ) . DB04946 was the most potent drug at the two adrenergic receptors . ORG 5222 was the most potent drug at dopamine D2 and 5-HT2c receptors , while ziprasidone was the most potent compound at three serotonergic receptors ( P08908 , P28221 , and 5- Q13049 ) . At the remaining two receptors , olanzapine was the most potent drug at the histamine H1 receptor ( Kd=0.087 nM ) ; clozapine at the muscarinic receptor ( Kd=9 nM ) . Certain therapeutic and adverse effects , as well as certain drug interactions can be predicted from a drug 's potency for blocking a specific receptor . These data can provide guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antipsychotic drug .
