L-carnitine preserves endothelial function in a lamb model of increased pulmonary blood flow . BACKGROUND : In our model of a congenital heart defect ( Q8NE62 ) with increased pulmonary blood flow ( PBF ; shunt ) , we have recently shown a disruption in carnitine homeostasis , associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) /heat shock protein (Hsp)90 interactions that contribute to P29474 uncoupling , increased superoxide levels , and decreased bioavailable nitric oxide ( NO ) . Therefore , we undertook this study to test the hypothesis that L-carnitine therapy would maintain mitochondrial function and NO signaling . METHODS : Thirteen fetal lambs underwent in utero placement of an aortopulmonary graft . Immediately after delivery , lambs received daily treatment with oral L-carnitine or its vehicle . RESULTS : L- DB00583 -treated lambs had decreased levels of acylcarnitine and a reduced acylcarnitine:free carnitine ratio as compared with vehicle-treated shunt lambs . These changes correlated with increased carnitine acetyl transferase ( P43155 ) protein and enzyme activity and decreased levels of nitrated P43155 . The lactate:pyruvate ratio was also decreased in L-carnitine-treated lambs . Hsp70 protein levels were significantly decreased , and this correlated with increases in P29474 /Hsp90 interactions , NOS activity , and NOx levels , and a significant decrease in P29474 -derived superoxide . Furthermore , acetylcholine significantly decreased left pulmonary vascular resistance only in L-carnitine-treated lambs . CONCLUSION : L- DB00583 therapy may improve the endothelial dysfunction noted in children with CHDs and has important clinical implications that warrant further investigation .
