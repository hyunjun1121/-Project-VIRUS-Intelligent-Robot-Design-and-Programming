P62937 and calcineurin functions investigated by gene inactivation , cyclosporin A inhibition and cDNA arrays approaches in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea . Calcineurin phosphatase and cyclophilin A are cellular components involved in fungal morphogenesis and virulence . Their roles were investigated in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea using gene inactivation , drug inhibition and cDNA macroarrays approaches . First , the BCP1 gene coding for cyclophilin A was identified and inactivated by homologous recombination . The bcp1Delta null mutant obtained was still able to develop infection structures but was altered in symptom development on bean and tomato leaves . Opposite to this , calcineurin inhibition using cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) modified hyphal morphology and prevented infection structure formation . DB00091 drug pattern signature on macroarrays allowed the identification of 18 calcineurin-dependent ( CND ) genes among 2839 B. cinerea genes . Among the co-regulated CND genes , three were shown to be organized as a physical cluster that could be involved in secondary metabolism . The signature of BCP1 inactivation on macroarrays allowed the identification of only three BCP1 cyclophilin-dependent ( O75976 ) genes that were different from CND genes . Finally , no DB00091 drug pattern signature was observed in the bcp1Delta null mutant which provided a molecular target validation of the drug .
