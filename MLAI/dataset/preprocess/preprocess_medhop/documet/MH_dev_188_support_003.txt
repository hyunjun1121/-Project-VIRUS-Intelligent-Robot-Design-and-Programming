P08473 -blocking agent thiorphan affects cell growth and differentiation in long term culture of mouse bone marrow . P08473 -blocking agent thiorphan was added to long-term cultures of mouse bone marrow cells at the time of culture initiation ( time 0 ) or 2 weeks thereafter , when the stromal layer appears . Cellularity , cell morphology ( in cytospin smears ) and the yield of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells ( GM- Q15814 assay in agar ) were recorded . Low concentrations of thiorphan accelerated recovery of the cultures after an initial drop of the cell count . Expansion and maturation of the granulocytic lineage was promoted , with parallel decline of the GM- Q15814 yield . DB08626 probably interfered with the activity of enkephalinase ( endopeptidase 24.11 ) in the cultures . That enzyme is the CD10 surface marker ( P08473 ) of lymphoid , myeloid and stromal elements .
