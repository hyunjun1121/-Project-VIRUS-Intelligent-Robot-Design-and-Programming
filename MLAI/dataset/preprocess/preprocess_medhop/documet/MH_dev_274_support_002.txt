Estrogen-astrocyte-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone signaling : a role for transforming growth factor-beta(1) . The purpose of this study was to identify factors from astrocytes that can regulate P01148 neurosecretion . Exposure of P01148 -secreting ( GT1-7 ) cells to conditioned media ( CM ) from P13671 glial cells and hypothalamic astrocytes ( HA ) stimulated P01148 release . Assays of P13671 and HA CM revealed that transforming growth factor-beta(1) ( TGF-beta(1) ) and 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one ( 3alpha , 5alpha-THP ) , both known P01148 secretagogues , were present in CM and their levels increased in parallel to the P01148 -releasing activity of CM . In contrast , TGF-alpha was undetectable in P13671 or HA CM . Ultrafiltration to remove peptides with molecular weights > 10 kDa virtually abolished the P01148 -releasing ability of the HA CM . Furthermore , immunoneutralization with a panspecific DB00116 -beta antibody dose-dependently attenuated the P01148 -releasing activity of the CM . Rat hypothalamus and GT1-7 cells were demonstrated to express TGF-beta receptors as well as furin , an enzyme that converts latent TGF-beta(1) to active TGF-beta(1) . P03372 -alpha and Q92731 mRNA and protein were also demonstrated in HAs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and double immunofluorescence , and treatment with 17beta-estradiol ( 17beta-E(2) ) increased both active and latent TGF-beta(1) levels in HA CM . The effect of 17beta-E(2) was completely blocked by the ER antagonist ICI8280 . As a whole , these studies provide evidence of a previously undescribed 17beta-E(2)-TGF-beta(1)- P01148 signaling pathway .
