DB08904 -- what role does this new P01375 inhibitor have in the treatment of RA ? The efficacy and safety of a new tumor necrosis factor inhibitor , certolizumab pegol , in active rheumatoid arthritis has now been assessed in three phase III , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trials . This commentary focuses on the paper by Keystone et al. , in which patients were followed for the longest duration . This study , which compared two doses of subcutaneous certolizumab pegol with placebo in patients with active RA receiving methotrexate , showed no advantage of 400 mg over 200 mg certolizumab pegol over 52 weeks , after induction with 400 mg . The nature of the patients enrolled in this study , trial design and possible safety issues are discussed , as is whether this trial can teach us anything about tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in general . On the basis of the results from this study , certolizumab pegol does not represent a major addition to our armamentarium , but because of the slightly different mechanism of action and structure of this drug , and the apparently acceptable therapeutic effects over one year , it is , nevertheless , welcome .
