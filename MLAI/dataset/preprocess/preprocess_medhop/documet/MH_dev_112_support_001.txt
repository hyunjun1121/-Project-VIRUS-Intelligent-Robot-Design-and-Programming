Synergistic effect of curcumin and cisplatin via down-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase and excision repair cross-complementary 1 ( P07992 ) . Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) , a phenolic compound obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa , is known to have antiproliferative and antitumor properties . P19971 ( TP ) , an enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway , is considered an attractive therapeutic target , and its expression could suppress cancer cell death induced by DNA damage agents . Excision repair cross-complementary 1 ( P07992 ) is a protein involved the process of nucleotide excision repair . The P07992 gene is expressed at high levels in cancers and has been associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy . In this study , the effects of curcumin on TP and P07992 expression induced by cisplatin in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines was investigated . Exposure of the NSCLC cells to various concentrations of curcumin ( 5-40 Î¼M ) down-regulates the mRNA and protein levels of TP and P07992 through destabilization of the mRNA and proteins via a mechanism involving inactivation of Q02750 /2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P27361 /2 ) . Depletion of endogenous TP or P07992 expression by transfection with specific small interfering RNAs significantly decreases cell viability in curcumin-exposed NSCLC cells . Curcumin enhances the sensitivity of cisplatin treatment for NSCLC through inactivation of P27361 /2 and by decreasing the TP and P07992 protein levels . Enhancement of P27361 /2 signaling by constitutively active Q02750 /2 causes an increase in TP and P07992 protein levels and promotes cell viability after cotreatment with curcumin and cisplatin . Enhancement of the cytotoxicity to cisplatin by administration of curcumin is mediated by down-regulation of the expression levels of TP and P07992 and by inactivation of P27361 /2 .
