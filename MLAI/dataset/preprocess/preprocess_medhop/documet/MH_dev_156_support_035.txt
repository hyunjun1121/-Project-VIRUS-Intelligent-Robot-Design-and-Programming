[ Polarized light as an epigenetic factor in inhibition of inflammation ; a genome-wide expression analysis in recurrent respiratory diseases of children ] . Whole-body polarized light therapy has been primarily investigated in various clinical observations and in a few in vitro model systems . AIMS : In the present study , clinical and molecular effects of whole-body polarized light treatment on children suffering from recurrent respiratory infection were studied . METHODS : Incidence and duration of respiratory symptoms as well as the length of appropriate antibiotic therapy have been measured . Simultaneously , genome-wide gene expression pattern was examined by whole genome cDNA microarray in peripheral lymphocytes of children . RESULTS : Twenty of twenty five children showed a marked clinical improvement , while in five of twenty five had poor or no changes . Gene expression pattern of the peripheral lymphocytes of the patients was compared in favorable and poor responders . Lymphocytes of the children with a documented improved clinical response to polarized light therapy showed a decrease in the expression of chemokine genes , such as P09341 , P19875 , P10145 and in that of the tumor necrosis alpha ( TNFÎ± ) gene . On the contrary , a rapid elevation was found in the expression of gene encoding for P78329 , a leukotriene-B(4)-metabolizing enzyme . In children with poor clinical response to polarized light therapy , no similar changes were detected in the gene expression pattern of the lymphocytes . CONCLUSIONS : Improved clinical symptoms and modified gene expression profile of lymphocytes reveals anti-inflammatory effect upon whole body polarized light irradiation .
