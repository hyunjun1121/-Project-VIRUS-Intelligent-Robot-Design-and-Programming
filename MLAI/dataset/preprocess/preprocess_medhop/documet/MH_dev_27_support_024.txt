HIV induces both a down-regulation of Q9NWZ3 that impairs TLR signalling and an up-regulation of the antibiotic peptide dermcidin in monocytic cells . HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of invasive bacterial infections , even at early clinical stages with relatively normal P01730 (+) T-cell counts . The pathogenic mechanisms behind this are not fully understood . However , an increasing number of studies indicate that HIV may impair the innate immunity to bacteria by infecting key cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage . In this study , the effects of HIV infection on the protein profile of undifferentiated monocyte-like THP-1 cells were examined by a mass spectrometric approach based on stable isotope labelling with amino acid in cell culture ( SILAC ) . We identified 651 proteins , of which nine proteins were down-regulated and 17 proteins were up-regulated in HIV-infected THP-1 cells as compared to uninfected controls . Most remarkably , the IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 ( Q9NWZ3 ) , which is essential for virtually all TLR signalling , was suppressed , whereas the precursor for the antibiotic peptide P81605 was up-regulated in HIV-infected cells . Upon stimulation of either O60603 or O00206 , the HIV-infected THP-1 cells displayed reduced P01375 secretion . The HIV-induced down-regulation of Q9NWZ3 was reconfirmed in monocyte-derived macrophage cell cultures . These data suggests that HIV may impair the TLR signalling cascade for pathogen recognition in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and thus , may reduce the ability of the innate immune system to sense invading pathogens and initiate appropriate responses .
