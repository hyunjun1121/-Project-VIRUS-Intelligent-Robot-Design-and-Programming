Spotlight on etanercept in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . DB00005 ( Enbrel ) , a tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha antagonist produced by recombinant technology , is approved for use in the US as subcutaneous monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy . The drug is also indicated in patients with psoriatic arthritis , in whom it may be used in combination with methotrexate . In well designed trials in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis , short-term etanercept therapy ( typically 25 or 50mg twice weekly ) significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving a 75 % reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score compared with placebo . Similarly , in well designed trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis , treatment with short-term etanercept 25mg twice weekly , alone or in combination with methotrexate , improved clinical features of the disease , while radiographic progression of joint damage appeared to be significantly slowed in a nonblind 1-year extension . Short-term etanercept therapy was well tolerated in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis . DB00005 is thus a valuable new option for the treatment of patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis ( who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy or have failed other systemic therapies ) or with psoriatic arthritis .
