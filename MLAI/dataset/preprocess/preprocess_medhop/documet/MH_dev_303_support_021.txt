Significance of water molecules in the inhibition of cylin-dependent kinase 2 and 5 complexes . Interest in P24941 and Q00535 has stemmed mainly from their association with cancer and neuronal migration or differentiation related diseases and the need to design selective inhibitors for these kinases . In the present paper , eight Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations are carried out to examine the importance of structure and dynamics of water in the active site of both P24941 and Q00535 complexes with roscovitine and indirubin analogues . Together with previous results , the current work shows a highly conserved water-involved hydrogen bonding ( HB ) network in both P24941 - and Q00535 -indirubin combinations to complete information from the X-ray crystallography . The simulations suggest the importance of such a network for combining the inhibitor to the host protein as well as the significance of using an activated CDK as a template when designing new inhibitors . Different binding patterns of roscovitine in P24941 and Q00535 are detected during the simulations because of the different binding conformations of the group on the P06681 side chain , which might offer a clue toward finding highly selective inhibitors with regards to P24941 and Q00535 .
