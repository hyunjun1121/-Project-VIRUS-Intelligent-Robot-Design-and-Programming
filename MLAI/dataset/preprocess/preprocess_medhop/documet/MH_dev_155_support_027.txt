Caspase-mediated degradation of AMPA receptor subunits : a mechanism for preventing excitotoxic necrosis and ensuring apoptosis . Activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors of the AMPA and DB01221 subtypes likely contributes to neuronal injury and death in various neurodegenerative disorders . Excitotoxicity can manifest as either apoptosis or necrosis , but the mechanisms that determine the mode of cell death are not known . We now report that levels of AMPA receptor subunits P42261 and P48058 are rapidly decreased in cultured rat hippocampal neurons undergoing apoptosis in response to withdrawal of trophic support ( WTS ) , whereas levels of DB01221 receptor subunits Q9UHB4 , Q12879 , and Q13224 are unchanged . Exposure of isolated synaptosomal membranes to " apoptotic " cytosolic extracts resulted in rapid degradation of AMPA receptor subunits . Treatment of cells and synaptosomal membranes with the caspase inhibitors prevented degradation of AMPA receptor subunits , demonstrating a requirement for caspases in the process . DB01373 responses to AMPA receptor activation were reduced after withdrawal of trophic support and enhanced after treatment with caspase inhibitors . Vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxic necrosis was decreased after withdrawal of trophic support and potentiated by treatment with caspase inhibitors . Our data indicate that caspase-mediated degradation of AMPA receptor subunits occurs during early periods of cell stress and may serve to ensure apoptosis by preventing excitotoxic necrosis .
