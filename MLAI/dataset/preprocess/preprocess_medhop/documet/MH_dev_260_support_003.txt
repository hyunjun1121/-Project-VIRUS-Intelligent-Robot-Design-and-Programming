Critical role of P21453 and integrin β4 in P14210 /c- DB00134 -mediated increases in vascular integrity . Vascular endothelial cell ( EC ) barrier integrity is critical to vessel homeostasis whereas barrier dysfunction is a key feature of inflammatory disorders and tumor angiogenesis . We previously reported that hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) -mediated increases in EC barrier integrity are signaled through a dynamic complex present in lipid rafts involving its receptor , c- DB00134 . We extended these observations to confirm that P21453 ( sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 ) and integrin β4 ( P16144 ) are essential participants in P14210 -induced EC barrier enhancement . Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated P14210 -mediated recruitment of c- DB00134 , P16144 and P21453 to caveolin-enriched lipid rafts in human lung EC with direct interactions of c- DB00134 with both P21453 and P16144 accompanied by c- DB00134 -dependent P21453 and P16144 transactivation . Reduced P21453 expression ( siRNA ) attenuated both P16144 and Rac1 activation as well as c- DB00134 / P16144 interaction and resulted in decreased transendothelial electrical resistance . Furthermore , reduced P16144 expression attenuated P14210 -induced c- DB00134 activation , c- DB00134 / P21453 interaction , and effected decreases in Q14703 - and P14210 -induced EC barrier enhancement . Finally , the c- DB00134 inhibitor , DB05030 , suppressed P14210 -induced c- DB00134 activation as well as P21453 and P16144 transactivation . These results support a critical role for P21453 and P16144 transactivation as rate-limiting events in the transduction of P14210 signals via a dynamic c- DB00134 complex resulting in enhanced EC barrier integrity .
