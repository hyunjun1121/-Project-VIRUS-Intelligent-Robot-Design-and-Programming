A functional polymorphism in the P32297 gene and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a Korean population . A genome-wide association study has identified the 15q25 region as being associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) in Caucasians . This study intended as a confirmatory assessment of this association in a Korean population . The rs6495309C > T polymorphism in the promoter of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit 3 ( P32297 ) gene was investigated in a case-control study that consisted of 406 patients with P48444 and 394 healthy control subjects . The rs6495309 CT or TT genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of P48444 when compared to the rs6495309 CC genotype ( adjusted odds ratio = 0.69 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.50-0.95 , P = 0.023 ) . The effect of the rs6495309C > T on the risk of P48444 was more evident in moderate to very severe P48444 than in mild P48444 under a dominant model for the variant T allele ( P = 0.024 for homogeneity ) . The P32297 rs6495309C > T polymorphism on chromosome 15q25 is associated with the risk of P48444 in a Korean population .
