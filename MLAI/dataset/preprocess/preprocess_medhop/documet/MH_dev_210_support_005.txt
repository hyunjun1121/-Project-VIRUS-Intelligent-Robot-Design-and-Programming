Benzo[b]thiophene-based histone deacetylase inhibitors . Benzo[b]thienyl hydroxamic acids , a novel class of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors , were identified via a targeted screen of small molecule hydroxamic acids . Various substitutions were explored in the P01031 - and P13671 -positions of the benzo[b]thiophene core to characterize SAR and develop optimal inhibitors . It was determined that substitution at the P13671 -position of the benzo[b]thiophene core with a three-atom spacer yielded optimal Q13547 inhibition and anti-proliferative activity in murine erythroleukemia ( SC-9 ) cells .
