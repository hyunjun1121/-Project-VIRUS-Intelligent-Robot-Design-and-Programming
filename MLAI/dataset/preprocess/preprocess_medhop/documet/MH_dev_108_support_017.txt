P01375 antagonist mechanisms of action : a comprehensive review . During the past 30 years , elucidation of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease , psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis at the cellular and molecular levels has revealed that these diseases share common mechanisms and are more closely related than was previously recognized . Research on the complex biology of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) has uncovered many mechanisms and pathways by which P01375 may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases . There are 3 P01375 antagonists currently available : adalimumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody ; etanercept , a soluble receptor construct ; and infliximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody . Two other P01375 antagonists , certolizumab and DB06674 , are in clinical development . The remarkable efficacy of P01375 antagonists in these diseases places P01375 in the center of our understanding of the pathogenesis of many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases . The purpose of this review is to discuss the biology of P01375 and related family members in the context of the potential mechanisms of action of P01375 antagonists in a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases . Possible mechanistic differences between P01375 antagonists are addressed with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles .
