Dabrafenib and trametinib , alone and in combination for P15056 -mutant metastatic melanoma . Dabrafenib and trametinib were approved for use as monotherapies in P15056 -mutant metastatic melanoma by the U.S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 2013 , and most recently , their use in combination has received accelerated FDA approval . Both drugs target the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway : dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant P15056 that constitutively activates the pathway , and trametinib selectively inhibits Q02750 and P36507 proteins activated by RAF kinases . The phase III study of dabrafenib in P15056 (V600E) metastatic melanoma reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59 % objective RECIST response rate . The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) were improved compared with dacarbazine . Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for vemurafenib , the first FDA-approved P15056 inhibitor . Efficacy has been demonstrated in other P15056 -mutant genotypes . The phase III study of trametinib in P15056 inhibitor-na√Øve patients with P15056 (V600E) or P15056 (V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy . DB08911 is ineffective in patients who have progressed on P15056 inhibitors . A phase II trial of combined dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy , with less cutaneous toxicity . Here , we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies and in combination , and discuss their role in the management of P15056 -mutant melanoma .
