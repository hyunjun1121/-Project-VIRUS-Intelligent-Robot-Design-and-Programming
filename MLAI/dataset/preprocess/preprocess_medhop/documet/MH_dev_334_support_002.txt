Inhibition of p38alpha MAPK disrupts the pathological loop of proinflammatory factor production in the myelodysplastic syndrome bone marrow microenvironment . Myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) are common causes of ineffective hematopoiesis and cytopenias in the elderly . Various myelosuppressive and proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the high rates of apoptosis and hematopoietic suppression seen in P43034 . We have previously shown that p38 MAPK is overactivated in P43034 hematopoietic progenitors , which led to current clinical studies of the selective p38alpha inhibitor , DB05412 , in this disease . We now demonstrate that the myelosuppressive cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta are secreted by bone marrow ( BM ) cells in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner . Their secretion is stimulated by paracrine interactions between BM stromal and mononuclear cells and cytokine induction correlates with P28906 + stem cell apoptosis in an inflammation-simulated in vitro bone marrow microenvironment . Treatment with DB05412 inhibits P01375 secretion in primary P43034 bone marrow cells and protects cytogenetically normal progenitors from apoptosis ex vivo . Furthermore , p38 inhibition diminishes the expression of TNFalpha or IL-1beta-induced proinflammatory chemokines in BM stromal cells . These data indicate that p38 inhibition has anti-inflammatory effects on the bone marrow microenvironment that complements its cytoprotective effect on progenitor survival . These findings support clinical investigation of p38alpha as a potential therapeutic target in P43034 and other related diseases characterised by inflammatory bone marrow failure .
