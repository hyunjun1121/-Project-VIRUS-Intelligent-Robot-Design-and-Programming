The MAPK pathway and Q9BYW2 are involved in the induction of the human P05121 gene expression by insulin in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 . Enhanced levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) are considered to be a risk factor for pathological conditions associated with hypoxia or hyperinsulinemia . The expression of the P05121 gene is increased by insulin in different cells , although , the molecular mechanisms behind insulin-induced P05121 expression are not fully known yet . Here , we show that insulin upregulates human P05121 gene expression and promoter activity in HepG2 cells and that mutation of the hypoxia-responsive element ( HRE ) -binding hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( Q9BYW2 ) abolished the insulin effects . Mutation of E-boxes E4 and O94989 abolished the insulin-dependent activation of the P05121 promoter only under normoxia , but did not affect it under hypoxia . Furthermore , the insulin effect was associated with activation of HIF-1alpha via mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) but not PDK1 and P31749 in HepG2 cells . Furthermore , mutation of a putative FoxO1 binding site which was supposed to be involved in insulin-dependent P05121 gene expression influenced the insulin-dependent activation only under normoxia . Thus , insulin-dependent P05121 gene expression might be regulated by the action of both Q9BYW2 and FoxO1 transcription factors .
