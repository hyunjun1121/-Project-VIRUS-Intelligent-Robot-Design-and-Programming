Serum levels of DB01277 and P17936 during adjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer . High serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) are associated with an increased risk of breast , prostate , colorectal , and lung cancer whereas IGF binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) seems to exert a protective effect . Therefore , patients may benefit from low DB01277 levels and high P17936 levels . This study evaluated whether adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy modulates DB01277 and/or P17936 serum levels in breast cancer patients . In 18 patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for primary breast cancer , DB01277 and P17936 serum levels were measured with immunoassays during chemotherapy regimens of either 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( EC ) . Mean pre-treatment values of DB01277 and P17936 were 124+/-13 and 3698+/-186 ng/ml , respectively . No significant changes in DB01277 and P17936 serum concentrations were observed during adjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy . DB01277 levels significantly correlated with P17936 levels before and during chemotherapy . In conclusion , these chemotherapy regimens do not seem to modulate DB01277 or P17936 levels in a favourable or unfavourable way .
