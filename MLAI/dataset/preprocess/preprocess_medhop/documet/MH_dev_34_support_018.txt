Improved diabetic control during oral sulfonylurea treatment in two children with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus . Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( P01160 ) , defined as diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of age and requiring life-long insulin therapy , is a rare disorder of unknown etiology . Activating mutations of the Q14654 gene , which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the DB00171 -dependent potassium channel in beta-cells , have been found to cause 30-58 % of cases of P01160 . Sulfonylurea treatment in theses patients reduces or eliminates the need for exogenous insulin . We report two Taiwanese boys who were diagnosed with P01160 at 1 and 4.5 months of age . They had been treated with exogenous insulin for 6 and 15 years , respectively . In September 2006 , they were both found to have a Q14654 mutation ( valine-to-methionine at codon 59 ; V59M ) . DB01016 successfully increased the basal C-peptide level , lowered HbA(1c) , and reduced blood sugar excursions . In one patient , the insulin dose was reduced to 0.2 U/kg/day , and the other was able to discontinue insulin altogether . These two cases from Taiwan add to the experience with similar mutations reported in Caucasians .
