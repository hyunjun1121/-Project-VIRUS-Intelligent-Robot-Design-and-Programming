Preparation of phosphorylated starch by dry-heating in the presence of pyrophosphate and its calcium-phosphate solubilizing ability . Starch was phosphorylated through dry-heating in the presence of pyrophosphate at various conditions , and the characteristics of phosphorylated starch ( PS ) were examined . Starch phosphorylation increases as the pH increases from 3 to 6 , but diminishes at pH 7 . Increased temperatures enhance phosphorylation . Data from (31)P NMR suggests that starch phosphorylation occurs mainly at the P01024 -OH and P13671 -OH of the glucose residue . The phosphate linkage is mainly due to monostarch monophosphate . Although starch had almost no calcium phosphate-solubilising capacity , this capacity was markedly enhanced by phosphorylation . X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the crystal structure of hydroxyapatite was not present in the calcium phosphate-PS complex .
