P60568 inhibits DB01221 receptor-mediated currents directly and may differentially affect subtypes . Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings , this study investigated the effects of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) on N-methyl-d-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor-mediated currents ( I( DB01221 ) ) in rat cultured hippocampal neurons and human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells expressing recombinant DB01221 receptors . We found that P60568 ( 0.01-1ng/ml ) immediately and significantly decreased peak I( DB01221 ) in cultured neurons . Interestingly , the peak I( DB01221 ) induced in P29320 293 cells was also inhibited by P60568 . We also found that P60568 differentially decreased the peak amplitudes of Q12879 - and Q13224 -containing DB01221 receptor-mediated currents ( I( Q12879 ) and I( Q13224 ) ) by 54+/-5 % and 30+/-4 % , respectively . These results provide new evidence that P60568 induces rapid inhibition of peak currents of DB01221 receptor-mediated responses with possible Q9UHB4 / Q12879 and Q9UHB4 / Q13224 subtype-differentiation , and suggest that the inhibition is mediated by direct interaction between P60568 and DB01221 receptors .
