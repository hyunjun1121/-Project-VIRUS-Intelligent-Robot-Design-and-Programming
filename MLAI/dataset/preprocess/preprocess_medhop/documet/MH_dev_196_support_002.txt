Purinergic receptor-mediated rapid depletion of nuclear phosphorylated Akt depends on pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase , calcineurin , protein phosphatase 2A , and P60484 phosphatases . Akt is an important oncoprotein , and data suggest a critical role for nuclear Akt in cancer development . We have previously described a rapid ( 3-5 min ) and Q99572 -dependent depletion of nuclear phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) and effects on downstream targets , and here we studied mechanisms behind the pAkt depletion . We show that cholesterol-lowering drugs , statins , or extracellular DB00171 , induced a complex and coordinated response in insulin-stimulated A549 cells leading to depletion of nuclear pAkt . It involved protein/lipid phosphatases P60484 , pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase ( O60346 and -2 ) , protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , and calcineurin . We employed immunocytology , immunoprecipitation , and proximity ligation assay techniques and show that O60346 and calcineurin translocated to the nucleus and formed complexes with Akt within 3 min . Also P60484 translocated to the nucleus and then co-localized with pAkt close to the nuclear membrane . An inhibitor of the scaffolding immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 ( FKBP51 ) and calcineurin , FK506 , prevented depletion of nuclear pAkt . Furthermore , okadaic acid , an inhibitor of PP2A , prevented the nuclear pAkt depletion . Chemical inhibition and siRNA indicated that O60346 , PP2A , and P60484 were required for a robust depletion of nuclear pAkt , and in prostate cancer cells lacking P60484 , transfection of P60484 restored the statin-induced pAkt depletion . The activation of protein and lipid phosphatases was paralleled by a rapid proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) translocation to the nucleus , a P12004 - P38936 (cip1) complex formation , and cyclin D1 degradation . We conclude that these effects reflect a signaling pathway for rapid depletion of pAkt that may stop the cell cycle .
