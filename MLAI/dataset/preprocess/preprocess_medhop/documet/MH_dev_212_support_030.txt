Genetic ablation of Adamts13 gene dramatically accelerates the formation of early atherosclerosis in a murine model . OBJECTIVE : Q76LX8 ( a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats-13 ) cleaves P04275 , thereby modulating thrombosis and inflammation . Low plasma Q76LX8 activity is associated with cardiovascular events , including myocardial and cerebral infarction . Here , we investigated the role of Q76LX8 in the development of early atherosclerosis in a murine model . METHODS AND RESULTS : P02649 -null ( ApoE(-/-) ) and Adamts13-null ( Adamts13(-/-) ) ApoE(-/-) mice were fed with a high-fat Western diet for 12 weeks . Atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and aortic roots were quantified after staining . Leukocyte rolling and adhesion onto cremaster venules after oxidative injury were determined by intravital microscopy . Although plasma cholesterol levels were largely similar in both groups , the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta en face and in the aortic roots in the Adamts13(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice increased ≈ 5.5-fold ( P=0.0017 ) and ≈ 6.1-fold ( P=0.0037 ) , respectively . In addition , the ratio of plasma high- to low-molecular-weight P04275 multimers increased ≈ 3-fold . The leukocyte rolling velocities were significantly reduced ( P < 0.001 ) , with an increased number of leukocyte rolling ( P=0.0026 ) and macrophage infiltration into the atherosclerotic lesions in the Adamts13(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that Q76LX8 plays a critical role in modulating the development of early atherosclerosis , likely through the proteolytic cleavage of ultra-large P04275 multimers , thereby inhibiting platelet deposition and inflammation .
