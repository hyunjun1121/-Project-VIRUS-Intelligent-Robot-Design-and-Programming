Transactivation of PDGFRbeta by dopamine D4 receptor does not require PDGFRbeta dimerization . Growth factor-induced receptor dimerization and cross-phosphorylation are hallmarks of signal transduction via receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) . G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) can activate RTKs through a process known as transactivation . The prototypical model of RTK transactivation involves ligand-mediated RTK dimerization and cross-phosphorylation . Here , we show that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFRbeta ) transactivation by the dopamine receptor D4 ( P21917 ) is not dependent on ligands for PDGFRbeta . Furthermore , when PDGFRbeta dimerization is inhibited and receptor phosphorylation is suppressed to near basal levels , the receptor maintains its ability to be transactivated and is still effective in signaling to P27361 /2 . Hence , the P21917 -PDGFRbeta- P27361 /2 pathway can occur independently of a PDGF-like ligand , PDGFRbeta cross-phosphorylation and dimerization , which is distinct from other known forms of transactivation of RTKs by GPCRs .
