Gene expression by PBMC in primary sclerosing cholangitis : evidence for dysregulation of immune mediated genes . Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) is a chronic disease of the bile ducts characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate and obliterative fibrosis . The precise role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of PSC remains unknown . We used RNA microarray analysis to identify immune-related genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in PSC . Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) was isolated from both patients with PSC and age and sex matched healthy controls . Samples from 5 PSC patients and 5 controls were analyzed by microarray and based upon rigorous statistical analysis of the data , relevant genes were chosen for confirmation by RT-PCR in 10 PSC patients and 10 controls . Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering , gene expression in PSC was statistically different from our control population . Interestingly , genes within the P60568 receptor beta , P05231 and Q96HU1 Kinase pathways were found to be differently expressed in patients with PSC compared to controls . Further , individual genes , P01375 induced protein 6 ( TNFaip6 ) and membrane-spanning 4-domains , subfamily A ( ms4a ) were found to be upregulated in PSC while similar to Q99717 ( Q99717 ) was downregulated . In conclusion , several immune-related pathways and genes were differentially expressed in PSC compared to control patients , giving further evidence that this disease is systemic and immune-mediated .
