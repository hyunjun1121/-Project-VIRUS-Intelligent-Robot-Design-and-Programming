Retinoblastoma and the related pocket protein P28749 act as coactivators of Q13562 to enhance gene transcription . Gene inactivation studies have suggested that the product of the retinoblastoma gene , P06400 , is particularly limiting in pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) -expressing cell lineages . Indeed , in P06400 knock-out mice , these cells develop tumors with high frequency . To understand the implication of limiting P06400 expression in these cells , we investigated the action of P06400 and its related pocket proteins , P28749 and Q08999 , on P01189 gene transcription . This led to the identification of the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor , Q13562 , as a target of P06400 action . P06400 and to a lesser extent P28749 , but not Q08999 , enhance Q13562 -dependent transcription , and this activity appears to depend on direct protein interactions between the P06400 pocket and the helix-loop-helix domain of Q13562 . In vivo , Q13562 is found in a complex that includes P06400 and also the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B , which mediates corticotropin-releasing hormone activation of P01189 transcription . The formation of a similar complex in vitro requires the presence of P06400 as a bridge between Q13562 and NGFI-B . In P01189 -expressing AtT-20 cells , P06400 and P28749 are present on the P01189 promoter and inhibition of their expression through small interfering RNA decreases P01189 mRNA levels . The action of P06400 and its related proteins on P01189 transcription may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of the differentiation phenotype .
