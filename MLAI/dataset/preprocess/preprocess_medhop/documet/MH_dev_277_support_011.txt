Anticytokine treatment prevents the increase in the activity of DB00171 -ubiquitin- and Ca(2+)-dependent proteolytic systems in the muscle of tumour-bearing rats . The ascites hepatoma Yoshida AH-130 induces loss of body weight and tissue waste . Tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of muscle wasting in this model system , but other cytokines , such as interleukin-6 , may be involved . In order to verify whether a combined anticytokine treatment may synergistically counteract muscle protein degradation , tumour bearing rats were treated with pentoxyfilline ( PTX , an inhibitor of P01375 synthesis ) , or with suramin ( Q09428 , an antiprotozoal drug blocking the peripheral action of several cytokines including P05231 and P01375 ) , or both the drugs , and the effects on muscle proteolytic systems were assessed . Muscle protein loss in the AH-130-bearing rats was associated with increased activity of both the DB00171 -ubiquitin- and the calpain- dependent proteolytic pathways ( 246 % and 230 % of controls , respectively ) . Both PTX and Q09428 , either alone or in combination , prevented the depletion of muscle mass and significantly reduced the activity of muscle proteolytic systems . In particular , treatment with Q09428 , either alone or with PTX , induced a decrease in enzymatic activities to values similar to those of controls . The results obtained in the present paper demonstrate that : ( i ) muscle depletion in this model is indeed associated with increased proteasome- and calpain-dependent proteolysis , as previously suggested by increased mRNA expression of molecules pertaining to both pathways ; ( ii ) anticytokine treatments effectively reduce muscle protein loss by down-regulating the activity of at least two major proteolitic systems ; ( iii ) Q09428 is more effective than PTX in reducing the activity of proteolytic systems , possibly because of its multiple anticytokine action .
