Selective targeting of the repressive transcription factors P25490 and cMyc to disrupt quiescent human immunodeficiency viruses . Quiescent HIV-1 infection of resting P01730 (+) T cells is an obstacle to eradication of HIV-1 infection . These reservoirs are maintained , in part , by repressive complexes that bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). cMyc and P25490 are two transcription factors that are recruited as part of well-described , distinct complexes to the HIV-1 LTR and in turn recruit HDACs . In prior studies , depletion of single factors that recruit Q13547 in various cell lines was sufficient to upregulate LTR activity . We used short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) to test the effect of targeted disruption of a single transcription factor on quiescent proviruses in T cell lines . In this study , we found that depletion of P25490 significantly increases mRNA and protein expression from the HIV-1 promoter in some contexts , but does not affect Q13547 , Q92769 , O15379 , or acetylated histone 3 occupancy of the HIV-1 LTR . Conversely , depletion of cMyc or cMyc and P25490 does not significantly alter the level of transcription from the LTR or affect recruitment of HDACs to the HIV-1 LTR . Furthermore , global inhibition of HDACs with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) enhanced the increase in LTR transcription in cells that were depleted of P25490 .These findings show that despite prior isolated findings , redundancy in repressors of HIV-1 LTR expression will require selective targeting of multiple restrictive mechanisms to comprehensively induce the escape of quiescent proviruses from latency .
