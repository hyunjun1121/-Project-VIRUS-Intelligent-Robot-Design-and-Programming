The efficacy of activated protein C in murine endotoxemia is dependent on integrin CD11b . DB00055 ( P25054 ) , the only FDA-approved biotherapeutic drug for sepsis , possesses anticoagulant , antiinflammatory , and barrier-protective activities . However , the mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory functions are not well defined . Here , we report that the antiinflammatory activity of P25054 on macrophages is dependent on integrin CD11b/ P05107 , but not on endothelial protein C receptor ( Q9UNN8 ) . We showed that CD11b/ P05107 bound P25054 within specialized membrane microdomains/lipid rafts and facilitated P25054 cleavage and activation of protease-activated receptor-1 ( PAR1 ) , leading to enhanced production of sphingosine-1-phosphate ( Q14703 ) and suppression of the proinflammatory response of activated macrophages . Deletion of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of P25054 , a region critical for its anticoagulant activity and Q9UNN8 -dependent barrier protection , had no effect on its antiinflammatory function . Genetic inactivation of CD11b , PAR1 , or sphingosine kinase-1 , but not Q9UNN8 , abolished the ability of P25054 to suppress the macrophage inflammatory response in vitro . Using an LPS-induced mouse model of lethal endotoxemia , we showed that P25054 administration reduced the mortality of wild-type mice , but not CD11b-deficient mice . These data establish what we believe to be a novel mechanism underlying the antiinflammatory activity of P25054 in the setting of endotoxemia and provide clear evidence that the antiinflammatory function of P25054 is distinct from its barrier-protective function and anticoagulant activities .
