Down-regulation of lipoprotein lipase increases glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 muscle cells . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) are synthetic hypoglycemic agents used to treat type 2 diabetes . TZDs target the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) and improve systemic insulin sensitivity . The contributions of specific tissues to TZD action , or the downstream effects of P37231 activation , are not very clear . We have used a rat skeletal muscle cell line ( Q9BTT4 cells ) to demonstrate that TZDs directly target P37231 in muscle cells . TZD treatment resulted in a significant repression of lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) expression in Q9BTT4 cells . This repression correlated with an increase in glucose uptake . Down-regulation of P06858 message and protein levels using siRNA resulted in a similar increase in insulin-dependent glucose uptake . Thus , P06858 down-regulation improved insulin sensitivity independent of TZDs . This finding provides a novel method for the management of insulin resistance .
