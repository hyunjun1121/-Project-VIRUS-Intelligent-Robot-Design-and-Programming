Neuroprotective effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist , synthetic exendin-4 , in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptors are widely expressed in neural tissues and diminish neuronal degeneration or induce neuronal differentiation . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the P0C6A0 pathway on peripheral nerves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Diabetic and nondiabetic rats were treated with the P43220 agonist , synthetic exendin-4 ( i.p. , 1 nmol·kg(-1)·day(-1) ) or placebo for 24 weeks , and current perception threshold values , DB02527 levels and nerve fibre size in the sciatic nerve were measured . We also investigated P43220 expression , quantitative changes in P09936 -positive intraepidermal nerve fibres and cleaved caspase 3-stained Schwann cells by immunohistochemistry . KEY RESULTS : P43220 expression was detected in the sciatic nerve and skin . After exendin-4 treatment , the increase seen in current perception threshold values at 2000 and 250 Hz in diabetic rats was reduced . Also , the decrease in myelinated fibre size or axon/fibre area ratio in the sciatic nerve and the loss of intraepidermal nerve fibre in the skin of diabetic rats were ameliorated . These responses were closely associated with the attenuation of Schwann cell apoptosis and improvement in the DB02527 level in exendin-4-treated diabetic rats , compared with placebo-treated animals . CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS : DB01276 may prevent peripheral nerve degeneration induced by diabetes in an animal model , supporting the hypothesis that P0C6A0 may be useful in peripheral neuropathy . The neuroprotection is probably attributable to P43220 activation , antiapoptotic effects and restoration of DB02527 content .
