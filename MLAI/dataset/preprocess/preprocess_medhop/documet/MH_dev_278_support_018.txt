Identification of Fyn as the binding partner for the WASP N-terminal domain in T cells . P42768 ( WASP ) plays important roles in TCR signaling . In transgenic ( Tg ) mice , over-expression of the WASP N-terminal region ( exons 1-5 ) including the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena/ P50552 ) homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain and anti-WASP-EVH1 single-chain variable fragment ( scFv ) intracellular expressed antibodies ( intrabodies ) impairs P60568 production in activated T cells . However , it largely remains unknown that how this domain transduces TCR signaling . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that the WASP N-terminal domain specifically associates with the Fyn SH3 domain ; the interaction was uncovered by screening a Î»gt11 cDNA expression library obtained from the mouse T-cell line KKF . The interaction between Fyn and WASP was inhibited by over-expression of the WASP N-terminal domain and anti-WASP-EVH1 scFv intrabodies in gene-transfected NIH3T3 cells and T cells derived from these Tg mice . O43516 binding to the EVH1 domain of WASP was also inhibited in these Tg mice T cells . Furthermore , tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells following TCR stimulation was severely inhibited by over-expression of the WASP N-terminal domain . These observations strongly suggest that the WASP N-terminal domain plays a pivotal role in the TCR signaling cascade by binding to Fyn .
