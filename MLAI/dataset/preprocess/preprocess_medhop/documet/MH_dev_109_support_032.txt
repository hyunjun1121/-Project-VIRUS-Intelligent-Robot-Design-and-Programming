Consequences of immunogenicity to the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ReoPro and Remicade . The clinical consequences of immune antibodies generated to abciximab ( ReoPro ) and infliximab ( Remicade ) are described . DB00054 , a chimaeric Fab fragment that binds to the beta3 integrin of the P08514 /IIIa and alphavbeta3 receptors on human platelets , is approved in the US and Europe for use in percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) to prevent cardiac ischaemic complications . The effects of induced antibodies upon the safety and efficacy of repeat administration of abciximab have been evaluated in the ReoPro Re-administration Registry Study , in which 5.7 % of patients were HACA positive before re-treatment . An interim evaluation of 1000 patients has indicated that re-administration of abciximab can be accomplished in the setting of P05154 with an acceptable safety and efficacy profile . DB00065 is a chimaeric IgG1 antibody specific for human TNFalpha , and is approved in the US and Europe for the acute treatment of the signs and symptoms of Crohn 's disease and for the chronic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The incidence of antibodies to infliximab is reported to be approximately 10 % ; however , an inverse dose-immunogenicity relationship was observed , indicating that higher doses of infliximab ( > or = 3 to 10 mg/kg ) could reduce the incidence of immune antibodies . The induction of immune antibodies could also be reduced by concomitant administration of low-dose methotrexate and other immunosuppressant agents . Although antibodies to infliximab appeared to be associated with lower serum infliximab concentrations and a slightly higher incidence of infusion reactions , these immune antibodies were generally not associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy . In addition , the antibodies induced to infliximab are specific for infliximab , and do not cross-react with other currently available therapeutic antibodies .
