Growth factor-induced transcription of GluR1 increases functional AMPA receptor density in glial progenitor cells . We analyzed the effects of two growth factors that regulate oligodendrocyte progenitor ( O-2A ) development on the expression of glutamate receptor ( GluR ) subunits in cortical O-2A cells . In the absence of growth factors , GluR1 was the AMPA subunit mRNA expressed at the lowest relative level . P09038 ( P09038 ) caused an increase in GluR1 and GluR3 steady-state mRNA levels . Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) did not modify the mRNA levels for any of the AMPA subunits but selectively potentiated the effects of P09038 on GluR1 mRNA ( 4.5-fold increase ) . The kainate-preferring subunits Q13003 , Q16099 , and Q16478 mRNAs were increased by P09038 , but these effects were not modified by cotreatment with PDGF . Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that PDGF+ P09038 selectively increased the rate of GluR1 gene transcription ( 2.5-fold over control ) . Western blot analysis showed that GluR1 protein levels were increased selectively ( sixfold over control ) by PDGF+ P09038 . Functional expression was assessed by rapid application of AMPA to cultured cells . AMPA receptor current densities ( pA/pF ) were increased nearly fivefold in cells treated with PDGF+ P09038 , as compared with untreated cells . Further , AMPA receptor channels in cells treated with PDGF+ P09038 were more sensitive to voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines , as expected from the robust and selective enhancement of GluR1 expression . Our combined molecular and electrophysiological findings indicate that AMPA receptor function can be regulated by growth factor-induced changes in the rate of gene transcription .
