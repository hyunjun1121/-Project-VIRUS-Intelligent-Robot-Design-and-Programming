High expression levels of P48061 and P61073 predict recurrence of adamanti-nomatous craniopharyngiomas in children . BACKGROUND : Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma ( O14561 ) is a benign but maldevelopmental tumor with a high recurrence rate . OBJECTIVE : Theaim of this study was to investigate the dysregulated biological molecules that play important roles in the recurrence of O14561 . METHODS : We first performed microarray analysis on tumor samples from two pediatric patients with recurrent O14561 and from two pediatric O14561 patients without recurrence after a one-year follow-up . The expression of P48061 and P61073 in 45 specimens of pediatric O14561 was further evaluated by immunohistochemistry . These results were correlated with the clinicopathological parameters and survival of the patients . RESULTS : Four downregulated genes ( P25054 , ITGA , P43121 , and Q99727 ) and 16 upregulated genes ( O76096 , P43235 , P07711 , P48061 , P61073 , P02751 , Q96DB9 , P05106 , P08253 , P08254 , P09237 , P14780 , Q92570 , Q03405 , P16035 , and P15692 ) were found in the recurrent patients . P48061 and P61073 were highly expressed in 13 patients ( 28.9 % ) and 14 patients ( 31.1 % ) , respectively . High levels of P48061 and P61073 expression were significantly associated with a poor recurrence-free survival and were the prognostic factors for O14561 recurrence in pediatric patients . CONCLUSIONS : High levels of P48061 and P61073 expression were associated with O14561 recurrence . The role of P48061 and P61073 in the development of brain tumors requires further research .
