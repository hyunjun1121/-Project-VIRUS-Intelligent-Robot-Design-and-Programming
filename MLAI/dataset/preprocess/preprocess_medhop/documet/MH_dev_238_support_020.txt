In vivo imaging visualizes discoid platelet aggregations without endothelium disruption and implicates contribution of inflammatory cytokine and integrin signaling . The mechanism by which thrombotic vessel occlusion occurs independently of plaque development or endothelial cell ( EC ) disruption remains unclear , largely because of an inability to visualize the formation of thrombus , especially at the single-platelet level in real time . Here we demonstrate that rapidly developing thrombi composed of discoid platelets can be induced in the mesenteric capillaries , arterioles , and large-sized arteries of living mice , enabling characterization of the kinetics of thrombosis initiation and the multicellular interrelationships during thrombus development . Platelet aggregation without EC disruption was triggered by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) photochemically induced by moderate power laser irradiation . The inflammatory cytokines P01375 -α and IL-1 could be key components of the EC response , acting through regulation of P04275 mobilization to the cell surface . Thrombus formation was then initiated by the binding of platelet GPIbα to endothelial P04275 in our model , and this effect was inhibited by the ROS scavenger DB06151 . Actin linker talin-dependent activation of alphaIIb-beta3 integrin or Rac1 in platelets was required for late-phase thrombus stability . Our novel imaging technology illustrates the molecular mechanism underlying inflammation-based thrombus formation by discoid platelets on undisrupted ECs and suggests control of ROS could be a useful therapeutic target for the prevention of thrombotic diseases .
