Endothelial cell transforming growth factor-β receptor activation causes tacrolimus-induced renal arteriolar hyalinosis . Arteriolar hyalinosis is a common histological finding in renal transplant recipients treated with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus ; however , the pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unknown . In addition to increasing transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β levels , tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin by binding to FK506-binding protein 12 ( P62942 ) . P62942 alone also inhibits TGF-β receptor activation . Here we tested whether tacrolimus binding to P62942 removes an inhibition of the TGF-β receptor , allowing ligand binding , ultimately leading to receptor activation and arteriolar hyalinosis . We found that specific deletion of P62942 from endothelial cells was sufficient to activate endothelial TGF-β receptors and induce renal arteriolar hyalinosis in these knockout mice , similar to that induced by tacrolimus . DB00864 -treated and knockout mice exhibited significantly increased levels of aortic TGF-β receptor activation as evidenced by Q15796 /3 phosphorylation , along with increased collagen and fibronectin expression compared to controls . Treatment of isolated mouse aortas with tacrolimus increased TGF-β receptor activation and collagen and fibronectin expression . These effects were independent of calcineurin , absent in endothelial denuded aortic rings , and could be prevented by the small molecule TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB-505124 . Thus , endothelial cell TGF-β receptor activation is sufficient to cause vascular remodeling and renal arteriolar hyalinosis .
