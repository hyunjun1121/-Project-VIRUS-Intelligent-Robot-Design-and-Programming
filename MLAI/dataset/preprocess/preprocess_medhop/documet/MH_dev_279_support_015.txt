P12004 -dependent kinase 5 phosphorylates endothelial nitric oxide synthase at serine 116 . DB00435 ( NO ) production in endothelial cells ( EC ) is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues in endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) . Among these , P29474 -Ser116 is phosphorylated in the basal state , and its phosphorylation contributes to basal NO production . Here , we investigated the mechanism by which P29474 -Ser116 is phosphorylated during the basal state using bovine aortic EC . Although a previous study suggested that protein kinase C was involved in P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation , overexpression of various protein kinase C isoforms did not affect P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation . An in silico analysis using a motif scan revealed that the P29474 -Ser116 residue might be a substrate for proline-directed protein kinases . Roscovitine , a specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) , 1 , 2 , and 5 , but not an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or glycogen synthase kinase 3beta , inhibited P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation dose dependently . Furthermore , purified P06493 , 2 , or 5 directly phosphorylated P29474 -Ser116 in vitro . Ectopic expression of the dominant-negative Q00535 but not dominant-negative P06493 or dominant-negative P24941 repressed P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation and increased NO production . In addition , Q00535 activity was detected in bovine aortic EC , and coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies revealed a colocalization of P29474 and Q00535 . Cotransfection of Q00535 and p25 , the specific Q00535 activator , increased P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation and decreased NO production , but its parent molecule , p35 , and p39 , another activator , were not detected in bovine aortic EC , which suggests the existence of a novel Q00535 activator . Overall , this is the first study to find that Q00535 is a physiological kinase responsible for P29474 -Ser116 phosphorylation and regulation of NO production .
