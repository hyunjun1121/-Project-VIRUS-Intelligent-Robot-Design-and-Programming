Activation of lipid metabolism contributes to interleukin-8 production during Chlamydia trachomatis infection of cervical epithelial cells . Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases . Infection of the urogenital tract by C. trachomatis causes chronic inflammation and related clinical complications . Unlike other invasive bacteria that induce a rapid cytokine/chemokine production , chlamydial infection induces delayed inflammatory response and proinflammatory chemokine production that is dependent on bacterial growth . We present data here to show that the lipid metabolism required for chlamydial growth contributes to Chlamydia-induced proinflammatory chemokine production . By gene microarray profiling , validated with biochemical studies , we found that C. trachomatis LGV2 selectively upregulated P35354 ( P35354 ) and P35408 ( EP4 ) in cervical epithelial HeLa 229 cells . P35354 is an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of arachidonic acid conversion to prostaglandins , including prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) and other eicosanoids , whereas EP4 is a subtype of cell surface receptors for DB00917 . We show that Chlamydia infection induced P35354 protein expression in both epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and promoted DB00917 release . Exogenous DB00917 was able to induce interleukin-8 release in HeLa 229 epithelial cells . Finally , we demonstrated that interleukin-8 induction by Chlamydia infection or DB00917 treatment was dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein activity . Together , these data demonstrate that the host lipid remodeling process required for chlamydial growth contributes to proinflammatory chemokine production . This study also highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced habitat for parasitic pathogens as obligate intracellular organisms .
