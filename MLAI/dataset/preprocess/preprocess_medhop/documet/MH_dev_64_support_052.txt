Proteomic profiling of cancer stem cells derived from primary tumors of P04626 /Neu transgenic mice . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) overexpression leads to mammary tumorigenesis and its elevated levels lead to increase in cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) , invasion , and metastasis . CSCs are resistant to radiation/chemotherapeutic drugs and are believed to be responsible for recurrence/relapse of cancer . CSCs are isolated using flow cytometry based sorting , although reliable , this technology hinders the convenient identification of molecular targets of CSCs . Therefore to understand the molecular players of increased CSC through P04626 overexpression and to develop meaningful targets for combination therapy , we isolated and characterized breast CSCs through convenient tumorsphere culture . We identified the altered protein expression in CSC as compared to non-CSC using LC-MS/MS and confirmed those results using qRT-PCR and Western blotting . P02794 1 ( P02794 ) was identified as a candidate gene , which is involved in iron metabolism and iron depletion significantly decreased the self-renewal of CSCs . We further performed in silico analysis of altered genes in tumorsphere and identified a set of genes ( P06454 , P26447 , P06703 , TNXRD1 , P23219 , P35354 , P02533 , and P02794 ) , representing possible molecular targets , which in combination showed a promise to be used as prognostic markers for breast cancer .
