DB09341 -6-phosphate dehydrogenase and Q9NPH5 control P40763 activity in melanoma cells through a pathway involving reactive oxygen species , c- P12931 and SHP2 . BACKGROUND : DB09341 -6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( P11413 ) participates in glucose utilization by catalysing the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway in mammalian cells . Previous studies have shown that changes in P11413 levels can promote tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis via the P40763 /5 pathway in a human melanoma xenograft model . P11413 cooperates with Q9NPH5 ( Q9NPH5 ) in the cellular metabolism of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and in maintaining the intracellular redox state . METHODS : In this study , the effect of P11413 or Q9NPH5 silencing in the melanoma line A375 was examined in terms of redox state , proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src ( c-Src ) and the tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase SHP2 expression as well as cell cycle progression . RESULTS : The results demonstrate that : ( 1 ) Downregulation of cyclin D1 and P11802 and up-regulation of p53 and P38936 occurred in response to silencing of P11413 and Q9NPH5 thus resulting in P55008 /S cell cycle arrest and inhibition of A375 cell proliferation . ( 2 ) The blockade of cell proliferation is primarily due to a reduced DNA-binding activity of P40763 . ( 3 ) The DNA-binding activity of P40763 was regulated by the upstream factors , c- P12931 and SHP2 . Silencing of Q9NPH5 in A375 cells inhibited c- P12931 and SHP2 regulated P40763 activity . CONCLUSION : The data are consistent with a novel P11413 - Q9NPH5 -NADPH-ROS-c- P12931 /SHP2 pathway controlling P40763 activity in A375 melanoma cells .
