Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 Cells Activate Expression of Immunomodulatory Genes in THP-1 Cells . To understand the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 cells suggested from our previous study of in vivo anti-allergy and anti-virus effects , host immune responses in macrophage-like THP-1 cells after 4 h ( the early phase ) and 24 h ( the late phase ) of cocultivation with L-92 cells were investigated by transcriptome analysis . In the early phase of L-92 treatment , various transcription regulator genes , such as , NFkB1 , NFkB2 , P05412 , P31629 and Q01201 , and genes encoding chemokines and cytokines , such as P13236 , O14625 , P10147 and P01375 , were upregulated . Two transmembrane receptor genes , Q9NYK1 and P05362 , were also upregulated in the early phase of treatment . In contrast , many transmembrane receptor genes , such as P16871 , P33681 , Q9HC73 , P42081 , P06127 , HLA-DQA1 , P01589 , Q13261 and P15509 , and some cytokine genes , including P05231 , Q9NPF7 and O00626 , were significantly upregulated in the late phase after L-92 exposure . Some genes encoding cytokines , such as P01583 , P01584 and P10145 , and the enzyme P14902 were upregulated at both the early and the late phases of treatment . These results suggest that probiotic L-92 might promote Th1 and regulatory T-cell responses by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway , followed by the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in THP-1 cells .
