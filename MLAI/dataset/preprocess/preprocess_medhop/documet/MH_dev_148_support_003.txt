Increase in proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood without haemostatic changes after LPS inhalation . INTRODUCTION : Bronchoalveolar fibrin deposition is a characteristic of various lung disorders including acute lung injury , acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis . It is secondary to the activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis in the alveolar space , and can be stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) inhalation . The aim of this study was to determine the relation between compartmental stress in the lung and systemic response after LPS inhalation by measuring haemostatic parameters . PATIENTS AND METHODS : 12 healthy subjects underwent a bronchial challenge test with LPS ; sequential dosages were performed for 5 biological markers ( P05231 ( P05231 ) , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , P00734 Fragments 1 and 2 ( F 1+2 ) , cortisol and P00747 Activator Inhibitor 1 ( P05121 ) before endotoxin inhalation and 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 24 hours afterwards . RESULTS : P05231 and CRP levels in the peripheral blood were higher after LPS inhalation ; there was no activation of coagulation and no increase in P05121 level . CONCLUSION : This study confirms that despite systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines , LPS inhalation does not induce systemic haemostatic response to LPS challenge .
