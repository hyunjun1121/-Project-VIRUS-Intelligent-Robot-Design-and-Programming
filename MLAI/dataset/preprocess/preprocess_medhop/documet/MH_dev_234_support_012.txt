The effects of PTK787/ZK222584 , an inhibitor of VEGFR and PDGFRβ pathways , on intussusceptive angiogenesis and glomerular recovery from Thy1.1 nephritis . The aim of our study was to investigate the phenomenon of intussusceptive angiogenesis with a focus on its molecular regulation by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) /platelet-derived growth factor receptor β ( PDGFRβ ) pathways and biological significance for glomerular recovery after acute injury . Glomerular healing by intussusception was examined in a particular setting of Thy1.1 nephritis , where the lysis of mesangial cells results in an initial collapse and successive rebuilding of glomerular capillary structure . Restoration of capillary structure after induction of Thy1.1 nephritis occurred by intussusceptive angiogenesis resulting in i ) rapid expansion of the capillary plexus with reinstatement of the glomerular filtration surface and ii ) restoration of the archetypical glomerular vascular pattern . Glomerular capillaries of nephritic rats after combined P35968 and PDGFRβ inhibition by PTK787/ZK222584 ( DB04879 ) were tortuous and irregular . However , the onset of intussusceptive angiogenesis was influenced only after long-term DB04879 treatment , providing an important insight into differential molecular regulation between sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis . DB04879 treatment abolished α-smooth muscle actin and tensin expression by injured mesangial cells , impaired glomerular filtration of microspheres , and led to the reduction of glomerular volume and the presence of multiple hemorrhages detectable in the tubular system . Collectively , treatment of nephritic patients with DB04879 compound is not recommended .
