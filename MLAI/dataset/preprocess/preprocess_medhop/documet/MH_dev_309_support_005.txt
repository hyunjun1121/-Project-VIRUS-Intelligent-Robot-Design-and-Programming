Local inhibition of angiogenesis by halofuginone coated silicone materials . Anti-angiogenic therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of increased angiogenesis in certain diseases . We aimed to investigate the local anti-angiogenic effect of silicone implants coated with DB04866 , an angiogenesis inhibitor that inhibits synthesis of collagen-type-I and matrix metalloproteinases . The degree of angiogenesis was observed after implantation of surface modified DB04866 eluting silicone implants into a submuscular pocket in rats over a period of 3 months . Subsequently , key mediators of angiogenesis ( P01137 , P09038 , P02452 , P08253 , P14780 , P15692 and PDGF ) were established by immunohistological staining and RT-PCR and statistically evaluated . In comparison to uncoated silicone implants , DB04866 eluting silicone implants lead to a significant local decrease of angiogenesis . DB04866 eluting hybrid surface silicone implants have a significant local anti-angiogenic effect by down-regulating the expression activity of key mediators of angiogenesis .
