Pervanadate-induced shedding of the intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 ectodomain is mediated by membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) . In several vascular diseases , the ectodomain of intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 is shed by the proteolytic activity of a zinc-dependent endopeptidase , releasing a soluble form of the protein ( sICAM-1 ) , a common marker for inflammatory diseases . Since reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generated during prolonged inflammation are known to induce shedding or cleavage of several transmembrane proteins , we sought to explore the cleavage and enzymatic effects that the pervanadate , via oxidation and subsequent inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatase , has on P05362 cleavage . In these studies , we used endothelial cells ( ECs ) and 293 human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) cells expressing high-levels of surface P05362 . In addition , use of specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , small interfering (si)RNA designed to knockdown endopeptidase activity , and an immunocolocalization assay were employed to determine the identity of a specific metalloproteinase mediating pervanadate-induced sICAM-1 shedding . Our data indicate that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) is involved in pervanadate-mediated shedding of the sICAM-1 ectodomain in both cell types . Immunostaining and confocal microscopy provide visual evidence that P05362 and P50281 colocalize at the cellular surface following pervanadate treatment , further implicating the involvement of P50281 activity in this mode of P05362 shedding .
