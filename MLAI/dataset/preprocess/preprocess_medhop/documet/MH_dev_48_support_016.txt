Fetzima ( levomilnacipran ) , a drug for major depressive disorder as a dual inhibitor for human serotonin transporters and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 . Pharmacological management of Major Depressive Disorder includes the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors which targets serotonin transporters ( P31645 ) to increase the synaptic concentrations of serotonin . Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 ( P56817 -1 ) is responsible for amyloid β plaque formation . Hence it is an interesting target for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) therapy . This study describes molecular interactions of a new Food and Drug Administration approved antidepressant drug named ' Fetzima ' with P56817 -1 and P31645 . Fetzima is chemically known as levomilnacipran . The study has explored a possible link between the treatment of Depression and AD . ' Autodock 4.2 ' was used for docking study . The free energy of binding ( ΔG ) values for ' levomilnacipran- P31645 ' interaction and ' levomilnacipran- P56817 ' interaction were found to be -7.47 and -8.25 kcal/mol , respectively . DB08918 was found to interact with S438 , known to be the most important amino acid residue of serotonin binding site of P31645 during ' levomilnacipran- P31645 ' interaction . In the case of ' levomilnacipran- P56817 ' interaction , levomilnacipran interacted with two very crucial aspartic acid residues of P56817 -1 , namely , D32 and D228 . These residues are accountable for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the subsequent formation of amyloid β plaques in AD brain . Hence , Fetzima ( levomilnacipran ) might act as a potent dual inhibitor of P31645 and P56817 -1 and expected to form the basis of a future dual therapy against depression and AD . It is an established fact that development of AD is associated with Major Depressive Disorder . Therefore , the design of new P56817 -1 inhibitors based on antidepressant drug scaffolds would be particularly beneficial .
