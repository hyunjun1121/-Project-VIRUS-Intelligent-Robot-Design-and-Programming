Regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger P48764 by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exendin-4 in renal proximal tubule cells . The gut incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P0C6A0 ) is released in response to ingested nutrients and enhances insulin secretion . In addition to its insulinotropic properties , P0C6A0 has been shown to have natriuretic actions paralleled by a diminished proton secretion . We therefore studied the role of the P43220 agonist exendin-4 in modulating the activity of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger P48764 in LLC-PK(1) cells . We found that P48764 -mediated Na(+)-dependent intracellular pH ( pH(i) ) recovery decreased approximately 50 % after 30-min treatment with 1 nM exendin-4 . Pharmacological inhibitors and DB02527 analogs that selectively activate protein kinase A ( PKA ) or the exchange protein directly activated by DB02527 ( O95398 ) demonstrated that regulation of P48764 activity by exendin-4 requires activation of both DB02527 downstream effectors . This conclusion was based on the following observations : 1 ) the PKA antagonist H-89 completely prevented the effect of the PKA activator but only partially blocked the exendin-4-induced P48764 inhibition ; 2 ) the Q02750 /2 inhibitor U-0126 abolished the effect of the O95398 activator but only diminished the exendin-4-induced P48764 inhibition ; 3 ) combination of H-89 and U-0126 fully prevented the effect of exendin-4 on P48764 ; 4 ) no additive effect in the inhibition of P48764 activity was observed when exendin-4 , PKA , and O95398 activators were used together . Mechanistically , the inhibitory effect of exendin-4 on pH(i) recovery was associated with an increase of P48764 phosphorylation . Conversely , this inhibition took place without changes in the surface expression of the transporter . We conclude that P43220 agonists modulate sodium homeostasis in the kidney , most likely by affecting P48764 activity .
