A comparative study of the effects of inhibitory cytokines on human natural killer cells and the mechanistic features of transforming growth factor-beta . The major factors and mechanisms by which natural killer ( NK ) cells are inhibited in cancer patients have not yet been well defined . In this study , we conducted a comparative analysis of the effects of TGF-β , P22301 , and P05112 on primary NK cells , and it was demonstrated that ( 1 ) TGF-β most potently inhibited the overall function of NK cells . ( 2 ) It appears that TGF-β reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and the expression of c-myc . ( 3 ) It was also found that the P60568 -induced promoter-binding activities of C-myb , AP-1 , CREB , and AR were also completely suppressed upon TGF-β treatment . Interestingly , TGF-β also completely suppressed other transcription factors , which are constitutively activated . Among these factors , we further confirmed roles of AP-1 in NK-92 cell activation through c-jun and Q02750 inhibitor assay . Our study provides insight into the effects of TGF-β in modulating NK cell functions .
