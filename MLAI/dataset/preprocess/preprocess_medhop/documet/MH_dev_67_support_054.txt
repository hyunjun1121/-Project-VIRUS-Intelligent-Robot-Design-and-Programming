P04150 antagonism disrupts the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . Reconsolidation is the process whereby consolidated memories are destabilized upon retrieval and restabilized to persist for later use . Although the neurobiology of the reconsolidation of both appetitive and aversive memories has been intensively investigated , reconsolidation of memories of physiologically relevant social rewards has received little attention . Social play , the most characteristic social behaviour displayed by young mammals , is highly rewarding , illustrated by the fact that it can induce conditioned place preference ( CPP ) . Here , we investigated the role of signalling mechanisms implicated in memory processes , including reconsolidation , namely glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , DB01221 glutamatergic and P21554 cannabinoid receptors , in the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP in rats . Systemic treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone before , but not immediately after , retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . DB00834 did not affect social play-induced CPP in the absence of memory retrieval . Treatment with the DB01221 receptor antagonist MK-801 modestly affected the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP . However , the reconsolidation of social play-induced CPP was not affected by treatment with the mineralocorticoid and P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonists spironolactone and rimonabant , respectively . We conclude that glucocorticoid neurotransmission mediates the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories in rats . These data indicate that the neural mechanisms of the reconsolidation of social reward-related memories only partially overlap with those underlying the reconsolidation of other reward-related memories .
