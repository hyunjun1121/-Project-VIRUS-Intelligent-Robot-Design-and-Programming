Platelet-derived microparticle formation involves glycoprotein IIb-IIIa . Inhibition by RGDS and a Glanzmann 's thrombasthenia defect . While the physiologic role of platelet microparticles may include a stable , physical dispersion of concentrated surface procoagulant activity the mechanism(s) of platelet vesiculation remains unknown . We demonstrate using flow cytometric methods a central role for the beta 3 integrin glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb-IIIa complex and its ligand tetrapeptide DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 - DB00133 ( RGDS ) binding site in platelet vesiculation . Time- and calcium-dependent vesiculation of platelets in response to ADP , collagen , thrombin , phorbol myristate acetate , and the thrombin peptide SFLLRN were dramatically inhibited , in a concentration-dependent manner , by monoclonal antibodies to P08514 -IIIa ( A2A9 , DB00054 , PAC1 ) and RGDS . Complete inhibition with A2A9 and RGDS occurred at 7.5 micrograms/ml and 75 microM , respectively , while control antibodies and a mock peptide had no effect . Platelet vesiculation requires intact P08514 -IIIa and is fully supported by the intracellular pool of P08514 -IIIa alone since de-complexing of this heterodimer by calcium chelation completely abolished microparticle formation in response to collagen ( no alpha-granule release ) but not to thrombin or SFLLRN . A central role for P08514 -IIIa is supported by the near total inability of Glanzmann 's thrombasthenic ( type I ) platelets to vesiculate in response to thrombin , ADP , collagen , and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . This extends the biologic roles of P08514 -IIIa to include platelet vesiculation and suggests that one or all of its binding ligands play a role .
