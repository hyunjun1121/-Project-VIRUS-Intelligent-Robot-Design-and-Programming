Reduction of burn scar formation by halofuginone-eluting silicone gel sheets : a controlled study on nude mice . Burn scar formations can cause disfiguration and loss of dermal function . The purpose of this study was to examine whether application of modified silicone gel sheets with an antifibrotic drug halofuginone-eluting hybrid surface produce an effect on scar development . There were a total of 2 animal groups . The athymic nude mice ( nu/nu ) of both groups underwent transplantation of full-thickness human skin grafts onto their backs and setting of partial thickness burn injury . The status of local scar development was observed over a period of 3 months after the application of silicone gel sheets and also after application of surface-modified halofuginone-eluting silicone gel sheets . Subsequently , via real-time polymerase chain reaction , the cDNA levels from key mediators of scar formation ( transforming growth factor beta , P02452 , connective tissue growth factor , fibroblast growth factor 2 , matrix metalloproteinase 2 , matrix metalloproteinase 9 ) were established and statistically evaluated . In comparison with uncoated silicone gel sheets , the application of halofuginone-eluting silicone gel sheets lead to a significant difference in gene expression activity in scar tissue . DB04866 -eluting hybrid surface silicone gel sheets significantly increase the antiscarring effect of adhesive silicone gel sheets by deceleration and downregulation of scar development by normalization of the expression activity .
