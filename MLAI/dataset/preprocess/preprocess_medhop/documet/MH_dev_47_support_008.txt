The polymorphisms S503P and Q576R in the interleukin-4 receptor alpha gene are associated with atopy and influence the signal transduction . P05112 ( P05112 ) plays a major role in immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) production . Its signal is conferred to effector cells through binding to the alpha chain of the P05112 receptor ( IL-4Ralpha ) . We present further evidence for polymorphisms in the IL-4Ralpha gene having an effect on IgE regulation . For two of four common polymorphisms , S503P and Q576R , we found an association with lowered total IgE concentrations ( P=0.0008 if occurring together ) . The polymorphism S503P has not yet been described and is located within the I4R motif of the receptor . In vitro analyses using synthetic peptides of this region showed that the tyrosine kinase P23458 ( P23458 ) , as well as P35568 and Q9Y4H2 bind to the I4R motif irrespective of the polymorphism or a tyrosine phosphorylation . In vivo immunoassays using T cells of four different groups of individuals ( S503/Q576 ; P503/Q576 ; S503/R576 ; P503/R576 ) revealed that only in case of both polymorphisms the phosphorylation of P35568 and Q9Y4H2 , but not P23458 was increased . We found no binding of P42226 to the I4R synthetic peptides ; however , the phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of any of the two polymorphisms , including P503 alone . We discuss possible conformational changes of the receptor leading to the observed effects on the phosphorylation status of P35568 , Q9Y4H2 and P42226 , in addition to previous findings that Q576R alters P42226 binding . We conclude that P503 and R576 influence the signal transduction pathways through the IL-4Ralpha , an effect that is magnified by the presence of both polymorphisms . This could explain the observed association effects with lowered total IgE concentrations .
