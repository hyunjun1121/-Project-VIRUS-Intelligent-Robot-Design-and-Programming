Association between P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms and caffeine-induced anxiety . Caffeine produces mild psychostimulant and sometimes anxiogenic effects by antagonizing adenosine at A(1) and A(2A) receptors , and perhaps through interactions with other transmitter systems . DB00640 receptors are colocalized and functionally interact with dopamine receptors in the brain . Thus , functional polymorphisms in the genes for either adenosine or dopamine receptors may affect responses to caffeine . In this study , we examined associations between self-reported anxiogenic effects of caffeine and variation in the genes for A(2A) ( P29274 ) and DRD(2) ( P14416 ) receptors . Healthy male and female individuals ( n=102 ) , who consumed less than 300 mg caffeine per week , ingested capsules containing 0 , 50 , 150 , and 450 mg caffeine under double-blind conditions in four separate experimental sessions . Subjective anxiety was measured before and at repeated times after capsules were consumed . At the 150 mg dose of caffeine , we found a significant association between caffeine-induced anxiety ( Visual Analog Scales , VAS ) and P29274 rs5751876 ( 1976C/T ) , rs2298383 ( intron 1a ) and rs4822492 ( 3'-flank ) , and P14416 rs1110976 ( intron 6 ) . Caffeine-induced anxiety ( VAS ) was also associated with two-loci interactions of selected P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms . The lowest dose of caffeine did not increase ratings of anxiety while the highest dose increased anxiety in the majority of subjects . These findings provide support for an association between an P29274 polymorphism and self-reported anxiety after a moderate dose of caffeine . It is likely that other P29274 and P14416 polymorphisms also contribute to responses to caffeine .
