Determination of cobimetinib in human plasma using protein precipitation extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . Inhibition of Q96HU1 / P29323 kinase ( MEK ) is a promising strategy to control the growth of tumors that are dependent on aberrant signaling in the MEK pathway . DB05239 ( P16260 -0973 ) ( S ) -[3,4-Difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodo-phenylamino)-phenyl]- ( ( S ) -3-hydroxy-3-piperidin-2-yl-azetidin-1-yl ) -methanone ) inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines by inhibiting Q02750 and P36507 . A specific high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric assay was developed and validated for the determination of cobimetinib in human plasma . The overall mean recovery using protein precipitation extraction with acetonitrile was found to be 54.1 % . The calibration curve was ranged from 0.20 to 100ng/mL . The LLOQ was sensitive enough to detect terminal phase concentrations of the drug . The intra- and inter-assay precision ( % CV ) was within 10.3 % and 9.5 % for cobimetinib . The assay accuracy ( % RE ) was within Â±13.7 % of the nominal concentration values for cobimetinib with the normal analytical QCs . The developed assay was successfully used to analyze the human plasma samples ( for pharmacokinetic analysis ) from clinical trials .
