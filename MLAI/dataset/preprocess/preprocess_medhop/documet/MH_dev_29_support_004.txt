Suppressive effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 on interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production in insulin-producing cells is mediated by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production . During the development of Type 1 diabetes , inflammatory cytokines are known to induce the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) in pancreatic islets , and subsequent production of nitric oxide ( NO ) contributes to beta cell destruction . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) has been shown to reduce cytokine-induced apoptosis of beta cells . In this study , we investigated whether P0C6A0 affects cytokine-induced NO production , resulting in the inhibition of beta-cell apoptosis . We treated MIN6N8a mouse beta cells with interferon ( IFN ) -gamma in the presence or absence of P0C6A0 and found that P01579 treatment induced P35228 mRNA expression and NO production , which was significantly inhibited by treatment with P0C6A0 . Blocking of P43220 signaling via the cyclic AMP and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not directly affect the suppressive effect of P0C6A0 on IFN- gamma-induced P35228 mRNA expression . Further studies revealed that P01579 induced the expression of P01375 mRNA and protein , which synergistically induced NO production , and P0C6A0 treatment inhibited this induction of P01375 . To examine whether the reduction of P01375 by P0C6A0 treatment plays a role in suppressing NO production , we treated MIN6N8a cells with P01579 in the presence of anti- P01375 neutralizing antibody and found that NO production was reduced . In addition , treatment of mouse islets with P0C6A0 inhibited the expression of P35228 and TNFmRNA . These results suggest that P0C6A0 inhibits P01579 -induced NO production by suppression of P01375 production .
