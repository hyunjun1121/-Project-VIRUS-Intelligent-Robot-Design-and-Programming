Stimulation of host bone marrow stromal cells by sympathetic nerves promotes breast cancer bone metastasis in mice . Bone and lung metastases are responsible for the majority of deaths in patients with breast cancer . Following treatment of the primary cancer , emotional and psychosocial factors within this population precipitate time to recurrence and death , however the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear . Using a mouse model of bone metastasis , we provide experimental evidence that activation of the sympathetic nervous system , which is one of many pathophysiological consequences of severe stress and depression , promotes MDA-231 breast cancer cell colonization of bone via a neurohormonal effect on the host bone marrow stroma . We demonstrate that induction of O14788 expression in bone marrow osteoblasts , following β2AR stimulation , increases the migration of metastatic MDA-231 cells in vitro , independently of P48061 - P61073 signaling . We also show that the stimulatory effect of endogenous ( chronic stress ) or pharmacologic sympathetic activation on breast cancer bone metastasis in vivo can be blocked with the β-blocker propranolol , and by knockdown of Q9Y6Q6 expression in MDA-231 cells . These findings indicate that O14788 promotes breast cancer cell metastasis to bone via its pro-migratory effect on breast cancer cells , independently of its effect on bone turnover . The emerging clinical implication , supported by recent epidemiological studies , is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with O14788 signaling , such as DB06643 , could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the " vicious cycle " of bone destruction induced by these cells .
