Q9HBE4 signalling via P40763 primes human naive B cells to respond to P60568 to enhance their differentiation into plasmablasts . B-cell responses are guided by the integration of signals through the B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) , P25942 , and cytokine receptors . The common γ chain (γc)-binding cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -21 drives humoral immune responses via P40763 -dependent induction of transcription factors required for plasma cell generation . We investigated additional mechanisms by which Q9HBE4 / P40763 signaling modulates human B-cell responses by studying patients with P40763 mutations . Q9HBE4 strongly induced CD25 ( IL-2Rα ) in normal , but not P40763 -deficient , P29965 -stimulated naïve B cells . Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed P01589 as a direct target of P40763 . Q9HBE4 -induced CD25 expression was also impaired on B cells from patients with P31785 or Q9HBE5 mutations , confirming a requirement for intact Q9HBE5 signaling in this process . P60568 increased plasmablast generation and immunoglobulin secretion from normal , but not CD25-deficient , naïve B cells stimulated with P29965 / Q9HBE4 . P60568 and Q9HBE4 were produced by T follicular helper cells , and neutralizing both cytokines abolished the B-cell helper capacity of these cells . Our results demonstrate that Q9HBE4 , via P40763 , sensitizes B cells to the stimulatory effects of P60568 . Thus , P60568 may play an adjunctive role in Q9HBE4 -induced B-cell differentiation . Lack of this secondary effect of Q9HBE4 may amplify the humoral immunodeficiency in patients with mutations in P40763 , P31785 , or Q9HBE5 due to impaired responsiveness to Q9HBE4 .
