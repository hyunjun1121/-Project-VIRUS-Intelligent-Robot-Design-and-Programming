Molecular targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia . The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia has not changed significantly over the last 40 years . Recent progress in understanding the biology of this disease and identification of driver mutations has ushered in a new era of molecular therapeutics . Although a number of molecular markers and pathways have been identified and may serve as potential therapeutic targets , the best studied amongst these include P07333 like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) , DB01367 /RAF/MEK/ P29323 and Janus kinase ( O60674 ) . In this review we discuss the molecular biology of AML , with a special focus on the above mentioned pathways . We discuss novel molecular targeted therapies that are in preclinical and clinical development . These include AC-220 , sorafenib and midostaurin in P36888 mutated patients ; GSK1120212 and MSC1936369B in DB01367 mutated patients ; and DB08877 in O60674 mutated patients . Identification of such molecular mutations and appropriate use of targeted therapies , either alone or in combinations , may eventually revolutionize the treatment of AML .
