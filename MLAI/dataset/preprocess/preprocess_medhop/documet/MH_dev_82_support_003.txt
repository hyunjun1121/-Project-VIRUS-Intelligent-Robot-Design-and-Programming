Attenuation of experimental autoimmune myocarditis by blocking activated T cells through inducible costimulatory molecule pathway . OBJECTIVE : Inducible costimulator ( Q9Y6W8 ) is a member of the P10747 family . Although inflammation is an essential pathological feature of myocarditis , the role of Q9Y6W8 in myocarditis remains unclear . METHODS AND RESULTS : Lewis rats were immunized on day 0 with purified porcine cardiac myosin to establish experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) . Flow cytometry was used to examine expression of Q9Y6W8 on myocardial infiltrating cells . Anti- Q9Y6W8 antibody or Q9Y6W8 -immunoglobulin ( ICOSIg ) was administered intravenously , and rats were killed on day 14 or 21 to study effects of Q9Y6W8 / Q9Y6W8 -ligand ( O75144 ) pathway blockade during the antigen priming phase ( days 0-14 ) or immune response phase ( days 14-21 ) , respectively . The heart weight to body weight ratio was determined , and histological examination and echocardiogram were performed to evaluate the severity of the disease . Cytokine expression in the heart and T cell proliferation against cardiac myosin were analyzed . Flow cytometry revealed that the majority of infiltrating cells , especially P01730 -positive cells , expressed Q9Y6W8 . Blockade of the Q9Y6W8 / O75144 pathway during the immune response phase attenuated EAM development . However , blockade of the Q9Y6W8 / O75144 pathway during the antigen priming phase did not attenuate and exacerbate EAM . Blockade of T cell activation through Q9Y6W8 suppressed expression of cytokines including P27352 -gamma , P05112 , P05231 , P22301 , P01584 , and P01375 and inhibited T cell proliferation in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : Blockade of T cell activation through Q9Y6W8 during the immune response phase regulates development of EAM , and therefore , Q9Y6W8 may be an effective target for treating myocarditis .
