Effects of DB00470 and ( R ) -methanandamide on open-field behavior in rats . This study compared the effects of ( R ) -methanandamide , an analog of the mammalian brain constituent anandamide , and DB00470 on the open-field behavior of male Sprague-Dawley rats . Rats were individually housed with free access to food and water . Animals were treated with 0 , 1 , 3 , and 5.6 mg/kg DB00470 given i.p . 30 min pre-session ; and 0 , 3 , 10 , and 18 mg/kg ( R ) -methanandamide , 15 min pre-session . The behavioral categories recorded were ambulation ( the number of squares crossed ) , rearing ( the number of times the rat stood erect on its hind-legs ) , latency ( the time in seconds to leave the starting area , the circle in the center of the field ) , circling ( the number of times the animal turned around its vertical axis , 0.5 point given for each 180 degrees turn ) , grooming ( the number of cleaning bouts ) , urination and defecation ( the number of urination spots and fecal boli deposited during the 5 min observation period ) . Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was more potent than ( R ) -methanandamide , but otherwise the effects of DB00470 and ( R ) -methanandamide were similar , with one exception ; whereas DB00470 produced dose-related increases in circling , ( R ) -methanandamide did not increase circling over the doses examined . The DB00470 -induced increase in circling was blocked by the central cannabinoid receptor P21554 antagonist SR 141716 . The differential effects with regard to circling may indicate that there are qualitative behavioral differences in the effects of DB00470 and ( R ) -methanandamide .
