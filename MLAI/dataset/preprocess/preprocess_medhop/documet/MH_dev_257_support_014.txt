Monitoring the expression profiles of doxorubicin-resistant K562 human leukemia cells by serial analysis of gene expression . We examined the expression profiles of doxorubicin-resistant K562 cells by serial analysis of gene expression ( Q9NXZ1 ) to identify novel and/or partially characterized genes that might be related to drug resistance in human leukemia . Q9NXZ1 complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries were constructed from K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562 ( K562/ P35318 ) cells , and concatamer sequences were analyzed with Q9NXZ1 2000 software . We used 9792 tags in the identification of 1076 different transcripts , 296 of which were similarly expressed in K562 and K562/ P35318 cells . There were 343 genes more actively expressed in K562/ P35318 than in parental K562 cells and 437 genes expressed less often in K562/ P35318 cells . K562/ P35318 cells showed increased expression of well-known genes , including the genes for spectrin beta , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A ( P47813 ) , RAD23 homolog B , laminin receptor 1 , and polyA- , RAN- , and P05121 messenger RNA-binding proteins . K562/ P35318 cells showed decreased expression of the genes for fatty acid desaturase 1 ( O60427 ) , hemoglobin epsilon 1 , N-myristoyltransferase 1 , hemoglobin alpha 2 , DB00157 dehydrogenase Fe- Q15517 6 , heat shock 90-kDa protein , and karyopherin beta 1 . Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the increased expression of P47813 and the decreased expression of O60427 in K562/ P35318 cells . Prior to this investigation , such differences in the expression of these genes in doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells were unknown . Although we do not provide any evidence in the present report for the potential roles of these genes in drug resistance , Q9NXZ1 may provide a perspective into our understanding of drug resistance in human leukemia that is different from that provided by cDNA microarray analysis .
