The protective effect of rebamipide on paracellular permeability of rat gastric epithelial cells . BACKGROUND : Barrier function in gastric epithelial cells is essential for the gastric defence mechanism against acid back-diffusion into the mucosal layer . Our previous study indicated that trans-epithelial resistance ( Q9NZ01 ) of rat gastric epithelial cells was rapidly increased when the cells were exposed to acid . This response to acid was diminished by indometacin . AIM : Evaluate the effects of a mucoprotective agent , rebamipide , on the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) -induced increase of gastric epithelial permeability . METHODS : Rat gastric epithelial cells were plated on tissue culture inserts . Cells were exposed to a NSAID ( indometacin , 10-7 M ) . Trans-epithelial permeability was measured by Q9NZ01 and diffusion rate of 14C-mannitol . The effect of rebamipide was evaluated by measuring Q9NZ01 . Endogenous prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) production in culture medium was also measured . RESULTS : DB00328 gradually and significantly decreased Q9NZ01 and increased 14C-manitol permeability . Rebamipide reversed the indometacin-induced changes in epithelial permeability and induced DB00917 synthesis . This induction was blocked by either indometacin or a Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 specific inhibitor . CONCLUSIONS : P36551 inhibitors such as indometacin inhibit regulation of epithelial permeability by reducing DB00917 . P23219 has an important role in the gastric defense mechanism . Rebamipide suppressed an indometacin-induced increase in gastric epithelial permeability by increasing DB00917 levels in a P35354 dependent manner .
