The role of pemetrexed in advanced non small-cell lung cancer : special focus on pharmacology and mechanism of action . DB00642 is a newer antifolate drug that has been approved as first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in combination with cisplatin , and as single agent for relapsed or chemotherapy refractory NSCLC after platinum-containing chemotherapy , at a dose of 500 mg/m(2) . DB00642 undergoes intracellular activation by poly-gamma-glutamylation , that is essential for its antiproliferative activity . Polyglutamate derivatives mainly inhibit three key enzymes of intracellular folate metabolism , i.e. thymidylates synthase ( P04818 ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , with P04818 being the most relevant target . DB00642 undergoes rapid renal elimination as unchanged parent compound , with a terminal half-life of between two to five hours . In later clinical development , the usefulness of supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B(12) became evident , to control pemetrexed-related toxicity . The results from the phase III upfront registration study , a retrospective observational data , and a recent maintenance study of pemetrexed in NSCLC suggest histological subtype to be the most important predictive marker for clinical outcome in patients receiving pemetrexed , DB00642 is active in patients with non-squamous cell NSCLC while no benefit is seen in patients with squamous-cell histology , possibly as a result of different expression of intratumoral P04818 . These are important steps towards individualisation of anticancer treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC .
