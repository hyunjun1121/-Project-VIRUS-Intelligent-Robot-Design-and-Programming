The effect of antisense inhibition of urokinase receptor in human squamous cell carcinoma on malignancy . Concomitant expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its surface receptor ( Q03405 ) has been shown to correlate strongly with a more invasive tumor cell phenotype . A highly malignant human epidermoid carcinoma cell line ( HEp3 ) was transfected with a vector capable of expressing an antisense transcript complementary to 300 bases of the 5' end of Q03405 , including the ATG codon . Six stably transfected antisense ( AS-2 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 12 ) and eight control clones were characterized . All clones produced high levels of uPA activity . Examination of collagenase production and doubling time showed that all of the clones tested produced similar activities . The antisense clones showed a 20-74 % reduction in the Q03405 sites ; the Q03405 mRNA level was also reduced . A test of the invasive ability of all clones in a modified chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) showed that invasiveness of the antisense-inhibited clones was directly proportional to the density of surface Q03405 . The AS-2 clone , which expressed the lowest number of uPARs showed a significantly reduced level of invasion . The invasiveness of additional AS-inhibited clones was also reduced . Seven control and four AS-inhibited clones were tested for tumorigenicity on CAMs of chick embryos . Inoculation of control cells produced large tumors , while the As clones were non-tumorigenic . AS-2 did not produce tumors even if kept in vivo for up to 10 weeks. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
