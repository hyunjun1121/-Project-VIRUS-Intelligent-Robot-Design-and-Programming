The P28222 receptor mediates the effect of d-fenfluramine on eating caused by intra-hypothalamic injection of neuropeptide Y . d- DB00574 ( 0.63 mg/kg i.p. ) , a serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) releaser and re-uptake inhibitor , reduced the eating caused by neuropeptide Y ( 235 pmol ) injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus . The 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist metergoline ( 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg i.p. ) and the P08908 and P28222 receptor antagonist (+/-)-cyanopindolol ( 3.0 and 8.0 mg/kg s.c. ) significantly antagonized the effect of d-fenfluramine . The 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptor antagonist mesulergine ( 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg s.c. ) and the 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ketanserin ( 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p. ) did not significantly modify the effect , nor did the P08908 and P28222 receptor antagonist (-)-propranolol ( 20-40 nmol ) , injected bilaterally into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus . The results suggest that d-fenfluramine reduces neuropeptide Y 's hyperphagia by indirectly stimulating P28222 receptors outside the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus .
