DB01184 treatment for gastroparesis : demographic and pharmacogenetic characterization of clinical efficacy and side-effects . BACKGROUND : DB01184 is a useful alternative to metoclopramide for treatment of gastroparesis due to better tolerability . Effectiveness and side-effects from domperidone may be influenced by patient-related factors including polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes , drug transporters , and domperidone targets . AIMS : The aim of this study was to determine if demographic and pharmacogenetic parameters of patients receiving domperidone are associated with response to treatment or side-effects . METHODS : Patients treated with domperidone for gastroparesis provided saliva samples from which DNA was extracted . Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in seven candidate genes ( P08183 , P10635 , P14416 , P15382 , Q9Y6J6 , Q12809 , P51787 ) were used for genotyping . SNP microarrays were used to assess single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADRA1A , P35368 , and P25100 loci . RESULTS : Forty-eight patients treated with domperidone participated in the study . DNA was successfully obtained from each patient . Age was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.0088 ) . Genetic polymorphism in Q12809 was associated with effectiveness of domperidone ( p=0.041 ) . The efficacious dose was associated with polymorphism in P08183 gene ( p=0.0277 ) . The side-effects of domperidone were significantly associated with the SNPs in the promoter region of P25100 gene . CONCLUSIONS : Genetic characteristics associated with response to domperidone therapy included polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene P08183 , the potassium channel Q12809 gene , and Î±1D -- adrenoceptor P25100 gene . Age was associated with a beneficial response to domperidone . If verified in a larger population , this information might be used to help determine which patients with gastroparesis might respond to domperidone and avoid treatment in those who might develop side-effects .
