[ Effects of octreotide on necrosis of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice ] . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : DB00104 , a kind of somatostatin analogue , may inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . This study was to investigate the mechanism of inducing necrosis of HCC xenografts in nude mice by octreotide . METHODS : The proliferation of HepG2 cells was determined by MTT assay . Nude mice bearing HepG2 xenografts were treated with octreotide [ 100 microg times ; ( kg times ; d ) (-1) ] or normal saline ( as control ) for eight weeks . The necrosis of HCC was estimated by histology . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) was detected by immunohistochemistry . Somatostatin receptor 2 ( P30874 ) was quantified by Western blot and located with immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The proliferation of HepG2 cells was not obviously affected by 24-hour treatment of octreotide ( 0.1-1000 nmol/L ) in vitro . The tumor weight was significantly heavier in octreotide group than in control group [ ( 7.15+/-2.96 ) g vs. ( 4.21+/-3.11 ) g , P < 0.05 ] , while the proportion of necrotic volume was significantly higher in octreotide group than in control group [ ( 81.86+/-0.05 ) % vs. ( 43.75+/-0.06 ) % ,P < 0.05 ] . In contrast with control group , P15692 was undetected in the xenografts in octreotide group . P30874 expression in xenograft sinusoids was similar in both groups . CONCLUSION : With active proliferation of HCC cells , octreotide can induce necrosis in HCC xenografts only through the inhibition of angiogenesis mediated by P30874 in the tumor .
