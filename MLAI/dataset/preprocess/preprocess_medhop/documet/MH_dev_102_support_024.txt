DB00759 derivative minocycline inhibits autophagy and inflammation in concanavalin-a-activated human hepatoma cells . Inhibition of soluble matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity is among the non-antibiotic cellular effects exerted by the anti-inflammatory tetracycline derivative minocycline . The impact of minocycline on the signal transduction functions of membrane-bound MMPs is however unknown . We assessed minocycline in a concanavalin-A ( ConA ) -activated human HepG2 hepatoma cell model , a condition known to increase the expression of membrane type-1 MMP ( MT-MMP ) and to trigger inflammatory and autophagy processes . We found that minocycline inhibited ConA-induced formation of autophagic acidic vacuoles , green fluorescent microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( GFP-LC3 ) puncta formation , gene and protein expression of autophagy biomarker P10415 /adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 ( Q12983 ) , invasion biomarker P50281 , and inflammation biomarker cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 . Gene silencing of P50281 abrogated ConA-induced formation of autophagic acidic vacuoles and ConA-induced expressions of Q12983 and P35354 . DB01017 was also shown to inhibit ConA-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) phosphorylation as well as gene expression of Q8WY41 , a biomarker believed to colocalize with P50281 and the specific silencing of which further inhibited ConA-induced P40763 phosphorylation . Collectively , our data demonstrate that part of minocycline 's effects on autophagy could be exerted through the inhibition of P50281 signaling functions , which contribute to the autophagy and inflammatory phenotype of ConA-activated HepG2 cells .
