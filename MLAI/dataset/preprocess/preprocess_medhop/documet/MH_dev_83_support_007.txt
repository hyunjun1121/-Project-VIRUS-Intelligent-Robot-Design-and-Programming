The role of the spinal opioid receptor like1 receptor , the P25103 , and cyclooxygenase-2 in maintaining postoperative pain in the rat . Postoperative incident pain is not easily treated with opioids . Mechanical hyperalgesia induced by skin incision in rats is one of the animal models of postoperative incident pain . It is thought that mechanical hyperalgesia is maintained by the sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons . The P25103 , the opioid receptor like1 ( P41146 ) receptor , and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 reportedly are involved in the development of spinal sensitization . In this study , we clarified the role of the P25103 , the P41146 receptor , and P35354 in the maintenance of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by skin incision . A 1-cm longitudinal incision was made through skin and fascia of the plantar aspect of the right foot in the rat . Four hours after the skin incision , significant mechanical hyperalgesia developed . An P41146 receptor agonist ( nociceptin ) , P25103 antagonists ( CP-96,345 and FK888 ) , and P35354 inhibitors ( NS398 and JTE522 ) were administered intrathecally 4 h after the skin incision . An P41146 receptor agonist and P25103 antagonists , but not P35354 inhibitors , significantly attenuated the level of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by the skin incision . These findings suggest that the spinal P41146 receptor and the P25103 play an important role in maintaining the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by skin incision . IMPLICATIONS : Intrathecal injection of an P25103 antagonist and an P41146 receptor agonist may be effective for the treatment of postoperative incident pain .
