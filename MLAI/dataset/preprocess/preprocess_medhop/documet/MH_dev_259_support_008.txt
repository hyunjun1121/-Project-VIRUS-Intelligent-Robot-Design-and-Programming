Zerumbone suppresses phorbol ester-induced expression of multiple scavenger receptor genes in THP-1 human monocytic cells . Unregulated uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins ( ox-LDL ) via macrophage scavenger receptors ( SRs ) , such as lectin-like ox- P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) , is a key event in atherosclerosis . In the present study , we used differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model of the human small intestine to evaluate the suppressive effects of 16 traditional food items selected from Okinawa on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced P78380 mRNA expression in THP-1 human monocyte-like cells . Three Zingiberaceae plants , Curcuma aromatica Salisbury , Curcuma longa L. , and Zingiber zerumbet Smith , markedly suppressed that expression . When added to the apical sides of Caco-2 monolayers , zerumbone , a sesquiterpene from Z. zerumbet Smith , was found to permeate into the basolateral medium as an intact structure in a time-dependent manner . alpha-Humulene , a structural analog of zerumbone lacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group , did not suppress P78380 mRNA expression , indicating that its electrophilic moiety might play pivotal roles in its activities . Further , zerumbone attenuated the expression of SR-A , Q9H2A7 , and P16671 , but not that of P34810 or Q8WTV0 , leading to a blockade of DiI-acLDL uptake , while it also inhibited the transcriptional activities of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB . Together , our results indicate that zerumbone is a potential phytochemical for regulating atherosclerosis with reasonable action mechanisms .
