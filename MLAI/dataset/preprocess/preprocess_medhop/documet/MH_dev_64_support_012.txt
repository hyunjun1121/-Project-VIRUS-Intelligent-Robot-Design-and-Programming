Q08431 inhibits inflammasome-induced IL-1β production and limits postischemic cerebral injury . Milk fat globule- P01133 8 ( Q08431 ) plays important , nonredundant roles in several biological processes , including apoptotic cell clearance , angiogenesis , and adaptive immunity . Several recent studies have reported a potential role for Q08431 in regulation of the innate immune response ; however , the precise mechanisms underlying this role are poorly understood . Here , we show that Q08431 is an endogenous inhibitor of inflammasome-induced IL-1β production . Q08431 inhibited necrotic cell-induced and DB00171 -dependent IL-1β production by macrophages through mediation of integrin β(3) and Q99572 receptor interactions in primed cells . Itgb3 deficiency in macrophages abrogated the inhibitory effect of Q08431 on DB00171 -induced IL-1β production . In a setting of postischemic cerebral injury in mice , Q08431 deficiency was associated with enhanced IL-1β production and larger infarct size ; the latter was abolished after treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist . Q08431 supplementation significantly dampened caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production and reduced infarct size in wild-type mice , but did not limit cerebral necrosis in Il1b- , Itgb3- , or P2rx7-deficient animals . In conclusion , we demonstrated that Q08431 regulates innate immunity through inhibition of inflammasome-induced IL-1β production .
