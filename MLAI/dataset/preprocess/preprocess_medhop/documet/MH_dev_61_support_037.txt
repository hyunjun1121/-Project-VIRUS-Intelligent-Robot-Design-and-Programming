Extracellular DB00171 and nerve growth factor intensify hypoglycemia-induced cell death in primary neurons : role of P2 and NGFRp75 receptors . In this study , we monitored the direct expression of P2 receptors for extracellular DB00171 in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing metabolism impairment . DB09341 deprivation for 30-60 min inhibited P47900 receptor protein , only weakly modulated P51575 , Q9UBL9 and P56373 , and up-regulated by about two-fold Q99571 , Q99572 and P51582 . The P2X/Y antagonist basilen blue , protecting cerebellar neurons from hypoglycemic cell death , maintained within basal levels only the expression of Q99572 and P51582 proteins , but not Q99571 or P47900 . DB09341 starvation transiently increased ( up to three-fold ) the expression of NGFRp75 receptor protein and strongly stimulated the extracellular release of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ; about 10-fold ) . Exogenously added P01138 then augmented hypoglycemic neuronal death by about 60 % , increasing the percentage of Höechst-positive nuclei ( from approximately 62 to 95 % ) , reducing lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release ( from about 50 to 14 % ) and significantly overstimulating the hypoglycemia-induced expression of Q99572 and P51582 . Conversely , extracellular DB00171 augmented hypoglycemic neuronal death by about 80 % , reducing the number of Höechst-positive nuclei ( from approximately 62 % to 14 % ) , augmenting LDH outflow ( by about 30 % ) and further increasing the hypoglycemia-induced expression of NGFRp75 . Our results indicate that P2 and NGFRp75 receptors are modulated during glucose starvation and that extracellular DB00171 and P01138 drive features of , respectively , necrotic and apoptotic hypoglycemic cell death , aggravating the consequences of metabolism impairment in cerebellar primary neurons .
