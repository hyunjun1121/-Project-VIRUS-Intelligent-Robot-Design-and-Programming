Retinoic acid and synthetic analogs differentially activate retinoic acid receptor dependent transcription . We have developed an assay where the potency of retinoids in retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) mediated transcriptional activation can be rapidly evaluated . In this assay hRAR-alpha , hRAR-beta and hRAR-gamma were expressed in CV-1 cells together with a reporter gene containing a retinoic acid responsive element ( TRE3-tk-CAT ) . Concentrations required to obtain half-maximum induction ( ED50 ) of CAT-activity were determined for several retinoids , e.g. , all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA ) , 13-cis-retinoic acid ( 13- DB00982 ) , arotinoid acid ( DB02877 ) and m-carboxy-arotinoid acid ( m-carboxy- DB02877 , an inactive arotinoid analog ) . The ED50 values for RA decreased in the order of P10276 ( 24 nM ) greater than P10826 ( 4.0 nM ) greater than P13631 ( 1.3 nM ) , while the ED50 values for DB02877 and 13- DB00982 decreased in the order of P10276 ( 6.5 nM , 190 nM ) greater than P13631 ( 2.3 nM , 140 nM ) greater than P10826 ( 0.6 nM , 43 nM ) , respectively . No significant inductions were obtained when cells were treated with m-carboxy- DB02877 , even at 10 microM concentrations . The fold induction of CAT-activity for all compounds tested decreased in the order of P10276 greater than P10826 greater than P13631 .
