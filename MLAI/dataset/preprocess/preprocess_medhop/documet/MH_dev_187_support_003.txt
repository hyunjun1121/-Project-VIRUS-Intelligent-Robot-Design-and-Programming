DB00945 -like drugs , ethanol-induced rat gastric injury and mucosal eicosanoid release . The effect of oral administration of various non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs on ethanol-induced rat gastric injury and mucosal release of leukotriene C4 , 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid was investigated . It was found that besides sodium salicylate and high doses of aspirin , other salicylate-type drugs , such as diflunisal , DB00233 , 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and methyl salicylate , and several non-acidic compounds , such as proquazone , benzydamine and paracetamol , were gastroprotective . All these drugs inhibited ex vivo leukotriene C4 formation by ethanol-stimulated gastric mucosa . However , naproxen , lonazolac , ibuprofen , gentisic acid and DB00244 also inhibited leukotriene C4 formation , but were not protective . Gastroprotection was independent of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha formation . Both protective and non-protective drugs inhibited the ethanol-stimulated , but not the basal , release of 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid . The results indicate that the differential effects of various non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs on gastroprotection against ethanol are not correlated with specific effects on mucosal cyclooxygenase , P09917 or 15-lipoxygenase activity .
