Macroautophagy modulates cellular response to proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy . Macroautophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are two complementary pathways for protein degradation . The former degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles while the later degrades short-lived proteins . Recent findings indicate that suppression of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by proteasome inhibitors induces macroautophagy through multiple pathways , including ( 1 ) accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of Q9UBN7 ; ( 2 ) activation of the O75460 -JNK pathway ; ( 3 ) proteasomal stabilization of P18848 ; ( 4 ) inhibition of P42345 complex 1 signaling ; ( 5 ) reduced proteasomal degradation of LC3 . Induction of macroautophagy attenuates the antitumor effect of proteasome inhibitors in various types of cancer . These findings suggest that inhibition of macroautophagy may represent a novel strategy to enhance cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibition .
