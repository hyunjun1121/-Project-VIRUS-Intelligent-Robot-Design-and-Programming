[ P11511 inhibitors -- theoretical concept and present experiences in the treatment of endometriosis ] . The medical treatment of endometriosis needs to be optimized . Therapeutic management strategies of endometriosis-associated pain or recurrent disease is primarily aimed at downregulating the ovarian function or at antagonizing the effect of estrogen in ectopic endometrial implants . In this context , basic research is delivering powerful tools for the possible development of new , specific treatment modalities . Recently , aromatase overexpression has been detected in endometriotic tissue . P11511 ( p450arom ) is responsible for conversion of C19 androgens to estrogen in several human tissues . P11511 activity gives rise to local estrogen biosynthesis , which , in turn , stimulates prostaglandin E(2) production by upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , thus establishing a positive feedback cycle . Another abnormality in endometriosis , i. e. the deficiency in 17 beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type-II ( 17 beta-HSD-Type-II ) expression , impairs the inactivation of estradiol to estrone . In contrast to the eutopic endometrium , these molecular aberrations collectively favour accumulation of increasing amounts of local estradiol and prostaglandin E(2) in endometriosis . In several human cell lines , prostaglandin and estrogen concentrations are associated with proliferation , migration , angiogenesis , apoptosis resistance , and even invasiveness . Consequently , aromatase and P35354 are promising new therapeutic targets . In summary , specific aromatase inhibitors ( such as Letrozole , DB01217 or Exemestan ) or selective P35354 inhibitors ( e.g. Celecoxib , DB00533 ) are of great interest to be studied in clinical trials in premenopausal woman with endometriosis to extend the spectrum of currently available treatment options .
