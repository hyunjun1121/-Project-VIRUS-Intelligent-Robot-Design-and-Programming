Synthesis of oleanolic acid derivatives : In vitro , in vivo and in silico studies for P18031 inhibition . Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease that links different metabolic routes ; a point of convergence is the enzyme P18031 which turns off insulin and leptin receptors involved in glucose and lipid metabolism , respectively . Pentacyclic acid triterpenes such as oleanolic acid ( OA ) have proved to be excellent P18031 inhibitors , thus , the purpose of current work was to generate a series of derivatives that improve the pharmacological effect of OA . Our findings suggest that the presence of the carboxylic acid and/or its corresponding reduction product carbinol derivative ( H-bond donor ) in C-28 is required to maintain the inhibitory activity ; moreover , this is further enhanced by ester or ether formation on C-3 . The most active derivatives were cinnamoyl ester ( 6 ) and ethyl ether ( 10 ) . DB04088 showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity and significantly decrease of blood glucose levels on in vivo experiments . Meanwhile , 10 showed contrasting outcomes , since it was the compound with higher inhibitory activity and selectivity over P18031 and has improved interaction with site B , according with docking studies , the in vivo antidiabetic effect was similar to oleanolic acid . In conclusion , oleanolic acid derivatives have revealed an enhanced inhibitory effect over P18031 activity by increasing molecular interactions with either catalytic or allosteric sites and producing a hypoglycaemic effect on non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus rat model .
