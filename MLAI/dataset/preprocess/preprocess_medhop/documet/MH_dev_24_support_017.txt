Opioid and neurotransmitter regulation of pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptors in the ovariectomized estradiol-treated rat : role of altered DB00644 secretion . An acute transient fall in the number of pituitary DB00644 receptors ( P30968 ) is observed before the preovulatory gonadotropin surge in cycling rats and before the afternoon daily gonadotropin surge in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats . In the latter model , this fall can be reproduced by administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone , whereas the opioid agonist morphine acutely increases P30968 . In this study we investigated the mechanisms of this opioid effect and examined the effects of other neurotransmitter substances on modulation of pituitary P30968 . Administration of the dopaminergic agonists bromocriptine and L-dopa or the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker phenoxybenzamine elevated P30968 acutely from average basal values of 240 +/- 22 and 254 +/- 21 fmol/mg protein to maximal values of 374 +/- 49 , 441 +/- 67 and 461 +/- 75 fmol/mg , respectively , whereas the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine transiently decreased P30968 to 186 +/- 19 fmol/mg . Placement of radiofrequency lesions in the mediobasal hypothalamus or pretreatment with anti- DB00644 serum completely abolished the ability of both morphine and naloxone to modulate the number of P30968 . These data indicate that the opioid-induced modulation of pituitary P30968 requires an intact hypothalamus and that both dopaminergic and alpha-adrenergic neurotransmitter systems may be involved . The final step of this action probably involves acute modulation of DB00644 secretion ( altered frequency and/or amplitude ) , which results in acute transient changes in the number of pituitary P30968 .
