P08908 receptor responsivity in unipolar depression . Evaluation of ipsapirone-induced DB01285 and cortisol secretion in patients and controls . The selective P08908 receptor ligand ipsapirone ( IPS ) induces corticotropin ( DB01285 ) and cortisol secretion in humans . To explore P08908 receptor-mediated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) system activation in depression , 24 subjects ( 12 patients with unipolar depression and 12 individually matched controls ) were given 0.3 mg/kg IPS or placebo in random order . Compared with controls , the depressed patients exhibited significantly decreased DB01285 and cortisol responses to IPS in association with increased basal cortisol secretion . The impaired Q9Y251 response following P08908 receptor challenge in unipolar depression could have resulted from glucocorticoid-dependent subsensitivity of the ( post-synaptic ) P08908 receptor itself and/or from a defective postreceptor signaling pathway [ inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein ( Gi ) -adenylate cyclase complex function ] , thus supporting the hypothesis that a disintegrated 5-HT and Q9Y251 system interaction may be present in depression . Future studies of the Q9Y251 response to direct-acting P08908 ligands , such as IPS , should facilitate the assessment of 5-HT/ Q9Y251 system integrity in various affective disorders and its involvement in psychotropic drug effects .
