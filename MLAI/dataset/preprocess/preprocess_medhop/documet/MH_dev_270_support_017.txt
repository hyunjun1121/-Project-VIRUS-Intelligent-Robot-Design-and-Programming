Quantum dots trigger immunomodulation of the NFκB pathway in human skin cells . The immunological effects of quantum dots are dependent on a variety of factors including , but not limited to , exposure time and dosing concentrations . In this study , we investigated the influence of 15 nm CdSe/ZnS-COOH quantum dot nanocrystals ( QDs ) on cell density , viability , and morphology in human epidermal keratinocytes ( P29320 ) and human dermal fibroblasts ( HDF ) . Furthermore , inflammatory and non-inflammatory immune responses were measured using protein and real time PCR array analysis from HDF cells exposed to predetermined sub-lethal concentrations of QDs . CdSe/ZnS-COOH QDs caused concentration-dependent ( 1-120 nM exposure concentrations ) and time-dependent ( 8 h or 48 h ) cell death , as evidenced by metabolic activity and morphological changes . QD exposure induced upregulation of apoptotic , inflammatory and immunoregulatory proteins such as P01375 -α , IL-1B and P22301 . P09601 , an indicator of stress due to reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) and/or metals , was upregulated at the later time point as well . QDs also caused modulation of genes known to be associated with inflammatory ( IL1-β , P13500 , O43187 ) , immune ( IL-1 , P05231 , O75594 , P01009 , P22301 ) , stress due to ROIs and/or heavy metals ( P09601 ) , and apoptotic ( P29466 , P29274 ) responses . Cellular effects from QD exposure were found to primarily follow the NFκB pathway . In addition , QDs induced a differential cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and fibroblasts at different exposure concentrations and time points , even at physiologically relevant dosing concentrations , thus emphasizing the need to investigate potential mechanisms of action among different cell types within the same target organ .
