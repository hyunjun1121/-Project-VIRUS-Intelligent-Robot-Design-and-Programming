DB01411 , a leukotriene receptor antagonist , inhibits interleukin-5 production via a mechanism distinct from leukotriene receptor antagonism . BACKGROUND : DB01411 , a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 ( Q9Y271 ) antagonist , inhibits not only airway smooth muscle contraction , but also allergic inflammation . The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 ( P05113 ) inhibition in allergic inflammation . METHODS : Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera , followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast , dexamethasone , or both . The P05113 protein level in the culture medium was measured , and in situ hybridization of P05113 and Q9Y271 mRNA was performed using lung tissues . RESULTS : Pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of P05113 protein in the culture medium by 40 % . The combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect . Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of P05113 mRNA in eosinophils , lymphocytes , and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues . Q9Y271 mRNA was detected in macrophages , smooth muscle cells , eosinophils , and mast cells , but was less expressed in lymphocytes . DB01411 -induced inhibition of P05113 mRNA expression was noted in various cells , irrespective of their Q9Y271 mRNA expression status . In addition , cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the P05113 production . CONCLUSION : Our results indicate that pranlukast inhibits P05113 synthesis via a mechanism distinct from Q9Y271 antagonism .
