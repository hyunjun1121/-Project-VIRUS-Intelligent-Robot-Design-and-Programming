Distribution patterns of P12004 and P01160 in perinatal stages of the developing rat heart . Distribution patterns of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) and atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) were determined immunohistochemically and morphometrically in atrium and ventriculum of the developing rat heart in different stages of the perinatal period . During the prenatal period , P12004 and P01160 were localized in opposite patterns , particularly in trabecular myocytes . A distinct reduction in the percentage of P12004 -positive nuclei was detected starting at day 19 of the prenatal period , and these cells were rarely observed on postnatal days 30 and 60 . In cardiomyocytes , a distinct increase in P01160 positivity was found , whereas P12004 positivity was very low . It is concluded that P12004 expression gradually decreased from prenatal day 19 onwards , whereas P01160 expression increased in atria throughout the prenatal and postnatal periods , except for a decrease in P01160 expression in ventricles from prenatal day 21 onwards . The opposite expression patterns of P12004 and P01160 in trabecular myocytes of ventricles indicate that P01160 may have antimitogenic/antiproliferative effects in trabecular myocytes .
