Vitamin D metabolism , mechanism of action , and clinical applications . DB00169 is made in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the influence of UV light . DB00153 ( ergocalciferol ) is derived from the plant sterol ergosterol . Vitamin D is metabolized first to 25 hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) , then to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25(OH)2D ) . Q6VVX0 is the most important 25-hydroxylase ; O15528 is the key 1-hydroxylase . Both 25OHD and 1,25(OH)2D are catabolized by Q07973 . 1,25(OH)2D is the ligand for the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , a transcription factor , binding to sites in the DNA called vitamin D response elements ( VDREs ) . There are thousands of these binding sites regulating hundreds of genes in a cell-specific fashion . P11473 -regulated transcription is dependent on comodulators , the profile of which is also cell specific . Analogs of 1,25(OH)2D are being developed to target specific diseases with minimal side effects . This review will examine these different aspects of vitamin D metabolism , mechanism of action , and clinical application .
