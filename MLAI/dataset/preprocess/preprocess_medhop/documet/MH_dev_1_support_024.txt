Role of the chaperonin cofactor P61604 in protein folding and sorting in yeast mitochondria . Protein folding in mitochondria is mediated by the chaperonin P10809 , the homologue of E. coli GroEL . Mitochondria also contain a homologue of the cochaperonin GroES , called P61604 , which is a functional regulator of the chaperonin . To define the in vivo role of the co-chaperonin , we have used the genetic and biochemical potential of the yeast S. cerevisiae . The HSP10 gene was cloned and sequenced and temperature-sensitive lethal hsp10 mutants were generated . Our results identify P61604 as an essential component of the mitochondrial protein folding apparatus , participating in various aspects of P10809 function . P61604 is required for the folding and assembly of proteins imported into the matrix compartment , and is involved in the sorting of certain proteins , such as the Rieske DB01592 / Q15517 , passing through the matrix en route to the intermembrane space . The folding of the precursor of cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , imported into mitochondria as a fusion protein , is apparently independent of P61604 function consistent with observations made for the chaperonin-mediated folding of P00374 in vitro . The temperature-sensitive mutations in P61604 map to a domain ( residues 25-40 ) that corresponds to a previously identified mobile loop region of bacterial GroES and result in a reduced binding affinity of hsp10 for the chaperonin at the non-permissive temperature .
