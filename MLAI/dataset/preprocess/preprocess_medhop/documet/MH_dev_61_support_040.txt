Nerve growth factor and receptors are significantly affected by histamine stimulus through H1 receptor in pancreatic carcinoma cells . Nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of human pancreatic cancer . P01138 is synthesized as a proform ( proNGF ) that , when cleaved , releases mature ligand (mNGF). proNGF and mNGF bind to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor A ( TrkA ) and low-affinity receptor p75 to different extents . DB11320 is a potent stimulator of P01138 in the inflammatory lesion as determined by ELISA . This has generally been attributed to the accumulation of mNGF . To determine the effect of histamine on nerve growth factor/receptor expression in human pancreatic cancer , the present study explored intracellular and extracellular P01138 production and p75 and TrkA membrane receptor expression in the PANC-1 , KMP-6 and PK-1 cell lines . DB11320 enhanced P01138 secretion and mRNA expression in PANC-1 and KMP-6 cells , but not in PK-1 cells . proNGF was revealed using Western blotting to be the predominant form of P01138 , but was significantly reduced by histamine . p75 receptor binding was increased with histamine treatement , but no significant alteration was observed for TrkA . P12004 ( P12004 ) , an important indicator of cell proliferation , was significantly reduced by histamine stimulation . H1 and H2 receptors were both observed in the pancreatic cancer cells , and the alterations induced by histamine were counteracted by H1 receptor antagonist DB06691 ; however , the H2 receptor subtype was excluded from this process . These results suggest that histamine induces distinct nerve growth factor/receptor responsiveness via H1 receptor-induced signaling , thus affecting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation .
