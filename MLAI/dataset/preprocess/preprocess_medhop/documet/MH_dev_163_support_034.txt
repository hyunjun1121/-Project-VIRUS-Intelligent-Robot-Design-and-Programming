Loss of coordinated androgen regulation in nonmalignant ovarian epithelial cells with P38398 /2 mutations and ovarian cancer cells . Epidemiological studies have implicated androgens in the etiology/progression of epithelial ovarian cancer . Because normal and malignant ovarian epithelial cells are growth inhibited by transforming growth factor ( TGF ) beta , we tested the ability of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) to modulate this response and the expression of TGF-beta receptor types I and II . Cells derived from the ovarian surface epithelium of women undergoing oophorectomy ( n = 7 ) for nonovarian indications or with a germ-line P38398 or 2 mutation ( n = 9 ) , and from the ascitic fluid of patients with primary ovarian cancer ( n = 8 ) were cultured with and without DB02901 . Cell proliferation after TGF-beta1 or vehicle treatment was determined , and transcripts for TGF-beta receptors were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR . As low levels of androgen receptor were observed in the cultures , we also measured transcript levels for steroid receptor coactivators Q15788 , Q13772 , and Q9Y6Q9 . TGF-beta1 inhibited growth in 12 of 13 cultures tested , and DB02901 generally reversed this effect , demonstrating that androgens can block TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition in both malignant and nonmalignant ovarian epithelial cells . Transcripts for TGF-beta receptors , Q15788 , and Q13772 were found to be coordinately regulated by androgen in control cells , but not in either malignant or P38398 /2-positive cell cultures . These findings raise the possibility that by modulating steroid receptor coactivator expression , androgen might affect other hormonal responses and contribute to the initiation of ovarian cancer .
