Pulmonary hypertension in the newborn P30793 -deficient mouse . DB00360 ( BH4 ) is a regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity . Deficient levels result in P29474 uncoupling , with a shift from nitric oxide to superoxide generation . The hph-1 mutant mouse has deficient P30793 ( GTPCH1 ) activity , resulting in low BH4 tissue content . The adult hph-1 mouse has pulmonary hypertension , but whether such condition is present from birth is not known . Thus , we evaluated newborn animals ' pulmonary arterial medial thickness , biopterin content ( BH4+BH2 ) , H(2)O(2) and P29474 , right ventricle-to-left ventricle+septum ( RV/LV+septum ) ratio , near-resistance pulmonary artery agonist-induced force , and endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation . The lung biopterin content was inversely related to age for both types , but significantly lower in hph-1 mice , compared to wild-type animals . As judged by the RV/LV+septum ratio , newborn hph-1 mice have pulmonary hypertension and , after a 2-week 13 % oxygen exposure , the ratios were similar in both types . The pulmonary arterial agonist-induced force was reduced ( P < 0.01 ) in hph-1 animals and no type-dependent difference in endothelium-dependent or -independent vasorelaxation was observed . Compared to wild-type mice , the lung H(2)O(2) content was increased , whereas the P29474 expression was decreased ( P < 0.01 ) in hph-1 animals . The pulmonary arterial medial thickness , a surrogate marker of vascular remodeling , was increased ( P < 0.01 ) in hph-1 compared to wild-type mice . In conclusion , our data suggest that pulmonary hypertension is present from birth in the GTPCH1-deficient mice , not as a result of impaired vasodilation , but secondary to vascular remodeling .
