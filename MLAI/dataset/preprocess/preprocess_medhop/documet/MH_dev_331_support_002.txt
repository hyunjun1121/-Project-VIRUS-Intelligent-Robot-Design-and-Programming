Q13224 subunit selective DB01221 antagonists inhibit neurotoxic effect of alcohol-withdrawal in primary cultures of rat cortical neurones . N-Methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission is thought to play a central role in the development of alcohol dependence and this alteration is supposed to be due to a differential up-regulation of the Q13224 type of subunits . In this work , we examined the effect of some known ( CP-101,606 ; CI-1041 and Co-101,244 ) and novel indole-2-carboxamide derivative Q13224 subunit selective DB01221 receptor antagonists ( SSNAs ) ( RG-13579 and RG-1103 ) on the neurotoxic effect of withdrawal in ethanol pre-treated cultures of rat cortical neurones . The extent of neurotoxicity was estimated by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) that was released into the culture medium during the 24h withdrawal period . Here , we demonstrate that Q13224 SSNAs given in the course of the withdrawal potently reduced the LDH release in ethanol pre-treated cultures . One of our novel compound , RG-1103 , proved to be more potent than the reference Q13224 SSNAs tested in this work having similar potency as the most potent but non-subunit selective DB01221 receptor antagonist dizocilpine ( MK-801 ) . DB00659 , a currently used therapeutic drug for the treatment of alcoholism was also effective although only in high micromolar concentrations . According to these observations , Q13224 SSNAs are potent inhibitors of ethanol-withdrawal-induced neurotoxicity and considering that these agents have acceptable side effect profiles , they could be promising therapeutic candidates in the pharmacotherapy for physical signs of acute alcohol-withdrawal and associated neuronal damage .
