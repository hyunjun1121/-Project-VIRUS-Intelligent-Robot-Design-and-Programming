P01375 -alpha blocks apoptosis in melanoma cells when P15056 signaling is inhibited . The protein kinase P15056 , a component of the DB01367 /RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) kinase ( MEK ) / P29323 signaling pathway , regulates cell fate in response to extracellular signals . Activating mutations in P15056 occur in approximately 70 % of human melanomas . The active proteins stimulate constitutive pathway signaling , proliferation , and survival . Thus , inhibition of P15056 signaling in melanoma cells causes cell cycle arrest and induces cell death through apoptosis , validating P15056 as an important therapeutic target . Here , we show that the apoptosis induced by inhibition of P15056 signaling in melanoma cells can be prevented if the cells are treated with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha . This allows the cells to recover from the inhibition of P15056 signaling and reenter the cell cycle . This effect occurs due to a specific P01375 and P15056 interaction because P01375 does not prevent cell death in the presence of cisplatin , nitrogen mustard or thapsigargin . Furthermore , the cytokines P48023 , P50591 , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , and P05231 do not prevent cell death when P15056 signaling is inhibited . The survival mechanism requires nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) transcription factor activity , which is strongly induced by P01375 in these cells . These findings suggest that drugs that target the P15056 /MEK pathway could be combined with agents that target P01375 and/or NF-kappaB signaling to provide exciting new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of melanoma .
