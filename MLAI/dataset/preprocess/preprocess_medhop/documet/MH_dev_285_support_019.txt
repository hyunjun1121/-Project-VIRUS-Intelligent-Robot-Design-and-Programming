P03372 alpha regulates expression of the orphan receptor small heterodimer partner . Hormonal status can influence diverse metabolic pathways . Q15466 ( Q15466 ) is an orphan nuclear receptor that can modulate the activity of several transcription factors . DB00286 are here shown to directly induce expression of the Q15466 in the mouse and rat liver and in human HepG2 cells . Q15466 is rapidly induced within 2 h following treatment of mice with ethynylestradiol ( EE ) or the estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) -selective compound propyl pyrazole triol ( PPT ) . Q15466 induction by these estrogens is completely absent in ERalphaKO mice . Mutation of the human Q15466 promoter defined HNF-3 , HNF-4 , GATA , and AP-1 sites as important for basal activity , whereas EE induction required two distinct elements located between -309 and -267 . One of these elements contains an estrogen response element half-site that bound purified ERalpha , and ERalpha with a mutated DNA binding domain was unable to stimulate Q15466 promoter activity . This ERalpha binding site overlaps the known farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) binding site in the Q15466 promoter , and the combination of EE plus Q96RI1 agonists did not produce an additive induction of Q15466 expression in mice . Surprisingly , induction of Q15466 by EE did not inhibit expression of the known Q15466 target genes cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) or sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase ( Q9UNU6 ) . However , the direct regulation of Q15466 expression may provide a basis for some of the numerous biological effects of estrogens .
