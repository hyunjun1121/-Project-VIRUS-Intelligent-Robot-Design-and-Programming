DB09030 : a novel protease-activated receptor-1 inhibitor . INTRODUCTION : Platelet activation and reactivity are pivotal for both acute and chronic atherothrombotic event occurrences . AREAS COVERED : Only 20 % relative risk ( âˆ¼ 2 % absolute risk ) reduction associated with newer P2Y(12) receptor blocker therapy such as prasugrel and ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel indicates that dual antiplatelet therapy may be associated with a ceiling effect in attenuating platelet-mediated ischemic event occurrence and that residual ischemic event occurrences are mediated by other pathways that are unblocked by current antiplatelet therapy . Therefore , inhibition of the thrombin-protease-activated receptor ( PAR ) -1 interaction may provide additional benefits in attenuating ischemic event occurrence in selected patients . There are two major P25116 blockers are under investigations - vorapaxar and atopaxar . In preclinical and Phase I - II studies , inhibition of thrombin-mediated platelet activation by a P25116 inhibitor , in general , has added to the antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin and clopidogrel without increasing bleeding . However , intracranial hemorrhage in patients with a history of stroke associated with vorapaxar and hepatic toxicity associated with atopaxar are important concerns . EXPERT OPINION : At this time , the specific role of P25116 inhibitor in the settings of percutaneous coronary intervention and acute coronary syndrome , both during the acute setting and as a long-term therapeutic agent , is not clear . Although the P25116 inhibitors are associated with less bleeding , its effectiveness as an antithrombotic agent and also side effects are major concerns . Future large-scale trials with goals addressing these concerns are needed to define the specific role of P25116 receptor inhibitor .
