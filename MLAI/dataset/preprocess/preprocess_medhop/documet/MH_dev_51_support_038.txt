Acidic pH induces topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage . Acidic pH plays an important role in various pathophysiological states and has been demonstrated to be carcinogenic in animal models . Recent studies have also implicated acidic pH in the development of preneoplastic Barrett 's esophagus in human . However , little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying acidic pH-induced carcinogenesis . In the current study , we show that acidic pH , like the topoisomerase II ( P11388 ) poison DB00773 ( demethylepipodophyllotoxin ethylidene-beta-D-glucoside ) , induces tumors in 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene(DMBA)-initiated mice . The following studies in tissue culture models have suggested that acidic pH acts like a P11388 poison to induce P11388 -mediated DNA damage : ( i ) acidic pH induces P11388 -dependent DNA damage signals as evidenced by up-regulation of p53 and DB00133 -139 phosphorylation of P16104 [ a substrate for ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ) Q13315 and Rad3-related ( ATR ) kinases ] ; ( ii ) acidic pH-induced cytotoxicity in tumor cells is reduced in P11388 -deficient cells ; ( iii ) acidic pH increases the mutation frequency of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( P00492 ) gene in a P11388 -dependent manner ; and ( iv ) acidic pH induces reversible P11388 -mediated DNA strand breaks in vitro . We discuss the possibility that P11388 -mediated DNA damage may contribute to acidic pH-induced carcinogenesis .
