P08908 and P34969 receptors contribute to lurasidone-induced dopamine efflux . DB08815 is a novel , atypical antipsychotic drug with serotonin [ 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) ] 2A , P34969 , dopamine ( DA ) D2 antagonist , and P08908 receptor partial agonist properties . The ability of lurasidone to reverse the effects of subchronic administration phencyclidine , to impair novel object recognition in rats , an animal model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia , is dependent , in part , on its P08908 agonist and P34969 receptor antagonist properties . We tested whether P08908 partial agonism or P34969 antagonism , or both , contributed to the ability of lurasidone to enhance cortical and hippocampal DA efflux , which may be related to its ability to improve cognition . Here , we report that lurasidone , 0.25 and 0.5 , but not 0.1 mg/kg , subcutaneously , significantly increased DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner . DB08815 , 0.5 mg/kg , also produced a smaller increase in DA efflux in the nucleus accumbens . Pretreatment with the P08908 receptor antagonist , WAY100635 ( 0.2 mg/kg , subcutaneously ) , partially blocked the lurasidone-induced cortical and hippocampal DA efflux . Further , subeffective doses of the P08908 receptor agonist , tandospirone ( 0.2 mg/kg ) , or the P34969 antagonist , SB269970 ( 0.3 mg/kg ) , potentiated the ability of a subeffective dose of lurasidone ( 0.1 mg/kg ) to increase DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex . These findings suggest that the effects of lurasidone on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , DA efflux are dependent , at least partially , on its P08908 agonist and P34969 antagonist properties and may contribute to its efficacy to reverse the effects of subchronic phencyclidine treatment and improve schizophrenia .
