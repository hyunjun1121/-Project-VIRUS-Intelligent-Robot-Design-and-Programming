Enhanced goblet cell hyperplasia in HDC knockout mice with allergic airway inflammation . BACKGROUND : DB11320 is known to have immunoregulatory roles in allergic reactions through histamine receptor 1 ( P35367 ) , P25021 , Q9Y5N1 and Q9H3N8 . However , its role in goblet cell hyperplasia in the airways of asthma patients is yet to be clarified . OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to examine the role of histamine in goblet cell hyperplasia using histamine-deficient mice ( Hdc-/- mice ) with allergic airway inflammation . METHODS : Wild-type and Hdc-/- C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with ovalbumin ( OVA ) . After a 2-week exposure to OVA , goblet cell hyperplasia was evaluated . Cell differentials and cytokines in BALF were analyzed . The mRNA levels of P98088 and Gob-5 gene were determined quantitatively . RESULTS : The number of eosinophils in BALF increased in both the sensitized wild-type mice and Hdc-/- mice with OVA inhalation . In addition , the numbers of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in BALF increased significantly in the sensitized Hdc-/- mice with OVA inhalation compared to the wild-type mice under the same conditions . The concentrations of P05112 ( P05112 ) , P05113 , P35225 , Interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and P60568 in the BALF all increased significantly in both groups compared to those exposed to saline . In particular , the concentration of P01375 in the Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA was significantly higher than that in the wild-type mice under the same conditions . The mRNA levels of Gob-5 and P98088 , and the ratio of the goblet cells in the airway epithelium significantly increased in Hdc-/- mice exposed to OVA compared to wild-type mice . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggested that histamine may play a regulatory role in goblet cell hyperplasia in allergic airway inflammation .
