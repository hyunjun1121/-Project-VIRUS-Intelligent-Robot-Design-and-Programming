Proposal of pharmacogenetics-based warfarin dosing algorithm in Korean patients . DB00682 is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant drug for the prevention of thromboembolic disorders . We investigated the contribution of genetic variations of four genes and clinical factors to warfarin dose requirement and provided a warfarin-dosing algorithm based on genetic and clinical variables in Korean patients . We recruited 564 Korean patients on stable anticoagulation . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for the Q9BQB6 , P11712 , P78329 and P38435 were analyzed . Using multiple regression analysis , we developed a model to predict the warfarin requirement . The SNPs of Q9BQB6 , P11712 , P78329 and P38435 showed significant correlation with warfarin dose . Patients with the 3730AA genotype received significantly higher doses of warfarin than those with the 3730GG ( P=0.0001 ) . For P11712 , the highest maintenance dose was observed in the patients with wild-type genotype compared with the variant allele carriers ( P < 0.0001 ) . The multiple regression model including age , gender , body surface area ( BSA ) , international normalized ratio ( INR ) and four genetic polymorphisms accounted for 35 % of total variations in warfarin dose ( R(2)=0.3499 ; P < 0.0001 ) . This study shows that age , gender , BSA , INR and Q9BQB6 , P11712 and P78329 polymorphism affect warfarin dose requirements in Koreans . Translation of this knowledge into clinical guidelines for warfarin prescription may contribute to improve the efficacy and safety of warfarin treatment for Korean patients .
