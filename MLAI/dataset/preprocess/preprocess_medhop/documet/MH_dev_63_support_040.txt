Preservation of P09038 bioactivity using heparin-based nanoparticles , and their delivery from electrospun chitosan fibers . Here we present a novel matrix-mimetic nanoassembly based on polysaccharides . Chitosan electrospun fiber networks are decorated with heparin-containing polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles ( PCNs ) that present basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , both stably adsorbed to the surfaces and released into solution . These P09038 / Q15149 complexes can be released from the fibers with zero-order kinetics over a period of 30 days . Further modification of fibers with a single bilayer of polyelectrolyte multilayer ( P15941 ) composed of N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan and heparin completely prevent release , and the P09038 / Q15149 complexes are retained on the fibers for the duration of the release experiment ( 30 days ) . We also compare the mitogenic activity of these P09038 / Q15149 complexes delivered in two different states : adsorbed to a surface and dissolved in solution . P09038 / Q15149 complexes exhibit mitogenic activity with respect to ovine bone marrow-derived DB05914 , even after being preconditioned by incubating for 27 days at 37Â°C in solution . However , when the P09038 / Q15149 complexes are adsorbed to chitosan and coated with PEMs , the mitogenic activity of the P09038 steadily decreases with increasing preconditioning time . This work demonstrates a new system for stabilizing and controlling the delivery of heparin-binding growth factors , using polysaccharide-based matrix-mimetic nanomaterials . This work also contributes to our understanding of the preferred mode of growth factor delivery from porous scaffolds .
