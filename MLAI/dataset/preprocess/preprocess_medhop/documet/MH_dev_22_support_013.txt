A tumour necrosis factor alpha autocrine loop contributes to proliferation and nuclear factor-kappaB activation of Theileria parva-transformed B cells . Theileria infection of bovine leucocytes induces uncontrolled proliferation and a transformed phenotype comparable to tumour cells . Infected cells have many characteristics of activated leucocytes and use autocrine loops to augment proliferation . We have shown previously that , in infected B cells , P19957 -K controls a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) autocrine loop to increase both proliferation and activation of the activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcription factor . We show here that the same infected B cells also use a tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha autocrine loop that again contributes to proliferation and augments nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB activation . Interestingly , both pharmacological inhibition of P01375 synthesis and neutralizing anti- P01375 antibodies lead to a reduction in proliferation and a 50 % drop in NF-kappaB activation , without inducing apoptosis .
