DB00790 decreases P wave dispersion in patients with stage 1 hypertension . INTRODUCTION : P12821 inhibitors prevent atrial fibrillation episodes by effective control of blood pressure and improving electrical and structural remodelling in the atria . Increased P wave dispersion ( P35670 ) is a non-invasive electrocardiographic marker for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of perindopril treatment on P35670 in hypertensive patients . METHODS : Forty-eight hypertensive patients ( mean age 57.4+/-11.8 years , 18 men ) were included . Blood pressure values were determined and 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at the beginning and at the first week , first month , third month and sixth month of the perindopril treatment.The difference between maximum and minimum P wave durations was calculated as P35670 . RESULTS : PWDs were significantly shortened at the first , third and sixth months ( 41.7+/-8.8 ms , Q04695 +/-6.9 ms and 38.3+/-7.1 ms , respectively ) compared with baseline and first-week measurements ( 54.3+/-9.2 ms and 49.0+/-9.1 ms , respectively , p < 0.001 ) . Baseline P35670 was correlated with body mass index ( r=0.32 , p=0.026 ) , while P35670 at the sixth month of treatment was significantly correlated with left atrial volume index ( r=0.30 , p=0.042 ) . Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that P35670 at the sixth month was related to baseline P35670 ( p=0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : DB00790 treatment significantly reduced P35670 in hypertensive patients .
