Synthesis and evaluation of ( S ) -2-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)-4- ( [ 3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butyl-carbamoyl ] -methyl ) -benzoic acid ( [18F]repaglinide ) : a promising radioligand for quantification of pancreatic beta-cell mass with positron emission tomography ( PET ) . 18F-labeled non-sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent ( S ) -2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)-4- ( ( 3-methyl-1-(2-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)-butylcarbamoyl ) -methyl ) -benzoic acid ( [(18)F]repaglinide ) , a derivative of the sulfonylurea-receptor ( Q09428 ) ligand repaglinide , was synthesized as a potential tracer for the non-invasive investigation of the sulfonylurea 1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission tomography ( PET ) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes . [(18)F] DB00912 could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield ( RCY ) of 20 % after 135 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 98 % applying the secondary labeling precursor 2-[(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate . Specific activity was in the range of 50-60 GBq/micromol . Labeling was conducted by exchanging the ethoxy-moiety into a 2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy group . To characterize the properties of fluorinated repaglinide , the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive (19)F-compound for binding to the human Q09428 isoform was assessed . [(19)F] DB00912 induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 ( 1.03 ) yielding a dissociation constant ( K(D) ) of 134 nM . Biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets and was comparable to that of repaglinide . Finally , biodistribution of [(18)F]repaglinide was investigated in rats by measuring the concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection . Pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of approximately 0.12 % of the injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i . 50 % of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled repaglinide , indicating that [(18)F]repaglinide might be suitable for in vivo investigation with PET .
