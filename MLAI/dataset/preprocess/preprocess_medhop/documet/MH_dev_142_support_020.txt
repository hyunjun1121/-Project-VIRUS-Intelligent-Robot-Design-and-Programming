P10747 and P16410 coreceptor expression and signal transduction . T-cell activation is mediated by antigen-specific signals from the TCRzeta/CD3 and P01730 -CD8-p56lck complexes in combination with additional co-signals provided by coreceptors such as P10747 , inducible costimulator ( Q9Y6W8 ) , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 ( P16410 ) , programmed death ( P18621 ) , and others . P10747 and Q9Y6W8 provide positive signals that promote and sustain T-cell responses , while P16410 and P18621 limit responses . The balance between stimulatory and inhibitory co-signals determines the ultimate nature of T-cell responses where response to foreign pathogen is achieved without excess inflammation and autoimmunity . In this review , we outline the current knowledge of the P10747 and P16410 signaling mechanisms [ involving phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) , growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) , Filamin A , protein kinase C theta ( PKCtheta ) , and phosphatases ] that control T-cell immunity . We also present recent findings on Q6PIZ9 ( Q6PIZ9 ) regulation of P16410 surface expression , and a signaling pathway involving P16410 activation of PI3K and protein kinase B ( P31749 ) /AKT by which cell survival is ensured under conditions of anergy induction .
