Postnatal development of serotonin 1B , 2 A and 2C receptors in brainstem motoneurons . The effects of serotonin ( 5-HT ) on motoneurons are mediated via multiple receptor subtypes . In hypoglossal ( XII ) motoneurons , the prototypic brainstem motoneurons whose functions change during the postnatal period , 5-HT effects evolve from inhibitory to excitatory , probably in association with changes in receptor expression . We studied P28222 , 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptor mRNA in 414 dissociated XII motoneurons and 5- Q13049 protein in the XII , facial and spinal cervical ( P06681 -3 ) motor nuclei . The percentage of motoneurons expressing distinct mRNAs varied with the postnatal age ( P09131 -33 days ) and receptor subtype . Initially , P28222 mRNA was present in 50-85 % of cells , but on P14 its expression transiently decreased below 35 % . 5- Q13049 mRNA was present in nearly all cells after P6 , but in less than 65 % on P09131 -5 . Normal and/or short splice variants of the P28335 mRNA were expressed in less than 20 % of motoneurons on P09131 -9 , and in approximately 35 % thereafter . P28222 and 5- Q13049 mRNAs often were expressed in different cells during early and intermediate postnatal periods , whereas P28335 mRNA never occurred alone . The 5- Q13049 receptor protein level gradually increased through P15 in the XII and facial nuclei , with dendritic labelling appearing in XII motoneurons only after P12 . In spinal motoneurons , both somatic and dendritic labelling was strongest on Q15084 and then decreased . The development of 5-HT receptors in XII motoneurons may be related to changes in feeding behaviour , whereas different cues regulate 5-HT receptor expression in upper spinal motoneurons .
