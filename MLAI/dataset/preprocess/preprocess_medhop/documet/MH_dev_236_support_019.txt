Hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning increases endothelial differentiation potential of human bone marrow CD133+ cells . CD133+ cells are hemangioblasts that have capacity to generate into both hematopoietic and endothelial cells ( ECs ) . Hypoxia/normoxia has shown to be the regulator of the balance between stemness and differentiation . In this study we performed Agilent 's whole human genome oligo microarray analysis and examined the differentiation potential of the bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells after hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning of CD133+ cells . Results showed that there was no significant increase in erythroid colony forming unit ( CFU-E ) and CFU-granulocyte , erythrocyte , monocyte , and megakaryocyte formation with cells treated under hypoxia/normoxia . However , a significant increment of EC forming unit at 24 h ( 143.2 +/- 8.0 % ) compared to 0 h ( 100 +/- 11.4 % ) was observed in CFU-EC analysis . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analysis showed that the differentiated cells diminished hematopoietic stem cell surface markers and acquired the gene markers and functional phenotype of ECs . The transcriptome profile revealed a cluster of 232 downregulated and 498 upregulated genes in cells treated for 24 h under hypoxia . The upregulated genes include angiogenic genes , angiogenic growth factor genes , angiogenic cytokine and chemokine genes , as well as angiogenic-positive regulatory genes , including Q14512 , PDGFB , Q16663 , P48061 , P80162 , P05231 , P21246 , O14944 , P04626 , O95136 , P11487 , Q92913 , Q99988 , P05412 , L1CAM , Q02297 , P08138 , and PDGFB . On the other hand , angiogenesis inhibitors and related genes , including P29459 , P98177 , Q9NY15 , and P16035 , are downregulated . Taken together , hypoxic/normoxic preconditioning may lead to the differentiation of CD133+ cells toward endothelial lineage , which may improve the current clinical trial studies .
