Wnt3/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is involved in adhesion-mediated drug resistance of multiple myeloma in an autocrine mechanism . Adhesion of myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells is now considered to play a critical role in chemoresistance . However , little is known about the molecular mechanism governing cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance ( P62158 -DR ) of myeloma cells . In this study , we focused our interests on the implication of the Wnt signal in P62158 -DR . We first screened the expression of Wnt family in myeloma cell lines and found that Wnt3 was overexpressed in all the myeloma cells examined . KMS-5 and ARH77 , which highly expressed Wnt3 protein , tightly adhered to human bone marrow stromal cells , and accumulation of beta-catenin and GTP-bounded RhoA was observed in these myeloma cell lines . Conversely , RPMI8226 and MM1S , which modestly expressed Wnt3 protein , rather weakly adhered to human bone marrow stromal . We then examined the relevance of Wnt3 expression to adhesive property to stromal cells and to P62158 -DR of myeloma cells . KMS-5 and Q5SW96 -77 exhibited apparent P62158 -DR against doxorubicin . This P62158 -DR was significantly reduced by anti-integrin beta(1) antibody , anti-integrin alpha(6) antibody and a Wnt-receptor competitor , secreted Frizzled-related protein-1 , and Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 , but not by the specific inhibitor of canonical signaling ( O94907 ) , indicating that Wnt-mediated P62158 -DR that is dependent on integrin alpha(6)/beta(1) ( P23229 ) -mediated attachment to stromal cells is induced by the Wnt/RhoA/Rho kinase pathway signal . This P62158 -DR was also significantly reduced by Wnt3 small interfering RNA transfer to KMS-5 . These results indicate that Wnt3 contributes to P23229 -mediated P62158 -DR via the Wnt/RhoA/ROCK pathway of myeloma cells in an autocrine manner . Thus , the Wnt3 signaling pathway could be a promising molecular target to overcome P62158 -DR of myeloma cells .
