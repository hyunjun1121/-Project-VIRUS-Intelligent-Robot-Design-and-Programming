P05231 - P40763 -HIF signaling and therapeutic response to the angiogenesis inhibitor sunitinib in ovarian clear cell cancer . PURPOSE : Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( OCCA ) is an uncommon histotype that is generally refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy . We analyze here the most comprehensive gene expression and copy number data sets , to date , to identify potential therapeutic targets of OCCA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Gene expression and DNA copy number were carried out using primary human OCCA tumor samples , and findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays . Circulating interleukin ( IL ) 6 levels were measured in serum from patients with OCCA or high-grade serous cancers and related to progression-free and overall survival . Two patients were treated with sunitinib , and their therapeutic responses were measured clinically and by positron emission tomography . RESULTS : We find specific overexpression of the P05231 - P40763 -HIF ( interleukin 6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-hypoxia induced factor ) pathway in OCCA tumors compared with high-grade serous cancers . Expression of P12272 and high levels of circulating P05231 in OCCA patients may explain the frequent occurrence of hypercalcemia of malignancy and thromboembolic events in OCCA . We describe amplification of several receptor tyrosine kinases , most notably MET , suggesting other potential therapeutic targets . We report sustained clinical and functional imaging responses in two OCCA patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease who were treated with sunitinib , thus showing significant parallels with renal clear cell cancer . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings highlight important therapeutic targets in OCCA , suggest that more extensive clinical trials with sunitinib in OCCA are warranted , and provide significant impetus to the growing realization that OCCA is molecularly and clinically distinct to other forms of ovarian cancer .
