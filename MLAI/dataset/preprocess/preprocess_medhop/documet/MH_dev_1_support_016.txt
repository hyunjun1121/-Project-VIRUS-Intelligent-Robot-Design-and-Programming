In vitro and in vivo biological activities of a novel nonpolyglutamable anti-folate , MX-68 . MX-68 is a newly synthesized anti-folate , chemically designed not to undergo intracellular polyglutamation and to have increased affinity to dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . In the present study , we examined the in vitro and in vivo biological activities of MX-68 compared with methotrexate ( MTX ) which forms several polyglutamates intracellularly . MX-68 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of PHA- , anti-CD3- , or PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and endothelial cells ( EC ) from normal subjects as well as P01584 - or P01375 alpha-stimulated synovial fibroblastic cells ( SC ) from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients . Coaddition of folinic acid completely reversed the anti-proliferative effects of both MX-68 and MTX . Although the anti-proliferative activities of MX-68 were almost comparable to those of MTX , the washout study clearly showed the characteristic nature of MX-68 . When drugs were removed during culture , the suppressive effect of MX-68 completely disappeared , whereas suppression by MTX was merely weakened . MX-68 dramatically suppressed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in mice when the drug was orally administered three times a week. starting from the day of first immunization . In this model , 2 mg/kg of MX-68 was sufficient to completely suppress arthritis , whereas suppression by the same dose of MTX was partial . These lines of evidence suggest that polyglutamation is not always a prerequisite in the anti-rheumatic effects of anti-folate . In addition , since intracellular accumulation of polyglutamates is thought to have adverse effects , MX-68 may become a more potent and less toxic anti-rheumatic drug than MTX .
