Albumin caused the increasing production of angiotensin II due to the dysregulation of P12821 / Q9BYF1 expression in P52789 cells . BACKGROUND : Previous studies have proposed that albuminuria is involved in the activation of intrarenal renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , while its potential mechanism is still unclear . We investigated the influence of albumin on the expression of P12821 / Q9BYF1 and generation of Ang II in P52789 cells . METHODS : The mRNA and protein expression of P12821 and Q9BYF1 was determined by RT-PCR and western blot respectively . Cellular localization of P12821 and Q9BYF1 was shown by laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSCM ) . The concentration of Ang II in the supernatant was detected by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) . RESULTS : Treatment of HK-2 cells to BSA led to a significant increasing expression of P12821 mRNA in dose and time dependent manner . The overexpression of P12821 protein induced by BSA was consistent with its mRNA expression . Meanwhile , the mRNA and protein expression of Q9BYF1 upon the stimulation of BSA was significantly downregulated in dose and time dependent manner . BSA could significantly increase the production of Ang II in the supernatant ( p < 0.05 ) . DB01197 , however , attenuated the expression of P12821 but increased expression of Q9BYF1 induced by BSA . CONCLUSION : These findings suggested a novel insight on the albuminuria induced activation of intrarenal DB01367 by upregulation of P12821 and downregulation of Q9BYF1 .
