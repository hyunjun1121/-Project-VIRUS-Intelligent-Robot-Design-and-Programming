[ The involvement of c-Abl and D40 ( Q8NG31 / Q8NG31 ) proteins in the regulation of cell proliferation and cancer ] . Although c-Abl and D40 proteins are localized predominantly in nucleus , they are involved in different cellular processes . c-Abl is a tyrosine-kinase that takes part in protein phosphorylation on tyrosine . Recently D40 has been identified as a component of outer kinetochore complex . Despite of functional differences between c-Abl and D40 proteins , they have some similarities . First , high expression levels of c-Abl and D40 were observed not only in proliferating somatic cells , such as tumors , but also in healthy human testis . The increased expression levels of c-Abl and D40 protein in spermatocytes and acrosome of spermatids indicate their role in meiosis and spermatogenesis . Second , both proteins interact with specific regions of chromatin and are involved in the regulation of cell growth and division . Third , P00519 and D40 ( Q8NG31 ) genes are involved in chromosomal translocations that subsequently form chimeric oncoproteins P11274 - P00519 , P41212 - P00519 and Q03164 - Q8NG31 in human leukaemia . Finally , both proteins interact with the tumor suppressor P06400 protein and subsequently can lead to regulation of the cell proliferation . The possible regulatory pathways that are controlled by c-Abl and D40 proteins are described here in details .
