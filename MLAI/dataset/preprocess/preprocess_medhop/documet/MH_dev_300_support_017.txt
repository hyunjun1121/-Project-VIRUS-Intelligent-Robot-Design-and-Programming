Autocrine stimulation of P35968 activates human leukemic cell growth and migration . Emerging data suggest that P15692 receptors are expressed by endothelial cells as well as hematopoietic stem cells . Therefore , we hypothesized that functional P15692 receptors may also be expressed in malignant counterparts of hematopoietic stem cells such as leukemias . We demonstrate that certain leukemias not only produce P15692 but also express functional P35968 in vivo and in vitro , resulting in the generation of an autocrine loop that may support leukemic cell survival and proliferation . Approximately 50 % of freshly isolated leukemias expressed mRNA and protein for P35968 . P15692 (165) induced phosphorylation of P35968 and increased proliferation of leukemic cells , demonstrating these receptors were functional . P15692 (165) also induced the expression of P14780 by leukemic cells and promoted their migration through reconstituted basement membrane . The neutralizing mAb DB06101 , specific to human P35968 , inhibited leukemic cell survival in vitro and blocked P15692 (165)-mediated proliferation of leukemic cells and P15692 -induced leukemic cell migration . Xenotransplantation of primary leukemias and leukemic cell lines into immunocompromised nonobese diabetic mice resulted in significant elevation of human , but not murine , P15692 in plasma and death of inoculated mice within 3 weeks . Injection of DB06101 inhibited proliferation of xenotransplanted human leukemias and significantly increased the survival of inoculated mice . Interruption of signaling by VEGFRs , particularly P35968 , may provide a novel strategy for inhibiting leukemic cell proliferation .
