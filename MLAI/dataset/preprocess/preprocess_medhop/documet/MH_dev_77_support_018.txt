Effect of botulinum toxin A on urothelial-release of DB00171 and expression of SNARE targets within the urothelium . AIMS : Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A ( DB00083 ) has emerged as an effective treatment of urinary bladder overactivity . Intravesical lipotoxin ( DB00083 delivery using liposomes ) , which may target the urothelium , is effective in blocking acetic acid induced hyperactivity in animals . The objective of this study was to assess the possible site of toxin action within the urothelium . METHODS : We examined expression of the toxin receptor ( SV2 ) and its cleavage targets ( P60880 and O00161 ) within urothelium as well as effects of the toxin on mechanically evoked release of DB00171 from cultured rat urothelial cells . DB00171 release was measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay ; we examined expression of O00161 and -25 in urothelial cells and mucosa of rat and human bladders . RESULTS : DB00083 ( 1.5 U ; 1-3 hr ) blocked hypotonic evoked release of urothelial DB00171 , without affecting morphology . The expression of protein targets for DB00083 binding ( SV2 ) was detected in human and rat bladder mucosa and catalytic action ( O00161 , -25 ) in urothelial cells and mucosa ( differed in intensity ) from rat and human bladder . Incubation of cultured ( rat ) urothelial cells with DB00083 decreased expression levels of both O00161 ( 44 % ) and P60880 ( 80 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings reveal that the bladder urothelium expresses the intracellular targets and the binding protein for cellular uptake of DB00083 ; and that the toxin is able to suppress the levels of these targets as well as hypotonic-evoked DB00171 release . These data raise the possibility that intravesical treatment with DB00083 suppresses bladder reflex and sensory mechanisms by affecting a number of urothelial functions including release of transmitters .
