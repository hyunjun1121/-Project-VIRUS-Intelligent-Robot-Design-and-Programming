Maturation of dendritic cells by recombinant human P29965 -trimer leads to a homogeneous cell population with enhanced surface marker expression and increased cytokine production . Dendritic cells ( DC ) have been shown to be potent inducers of specific cytotoxic T-cell responses both in vivo and in vitro . Furthermore , exposure to cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha or P25942 triggering changes DC phenotype and cytokine production and may enhance the T-cell activating capacity of the DC . We studied DC phenotype and cytokine production as well as the T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lympocyte ( CTL ) activation induced by DC generated in vitro . In addition , the effect of exposure to recombinant human P29965 -trimer ( huCD40LT ) on these parameters was investigated . Effective differentiation of monocytes derived from freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) was obtained with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) and interleukin ( IL ) -4 . The DC expression of human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) molecules , P33681 , Q01151 , and P42081 was markedly enhanced by exposure to huCD40LT even compared to P01375 exposure . Only a moderate cytokine production was observed initially , while P01375 addition or P25942 triggering , especially , induced enhanced production of P05231 and IL-12 p40 . Surprisingly , comparable induction of T-cell proliferation by a DC allostimulus or through the presentation of PPD , and influenza M1-peptide specific CTL activity was obtained with nonmaturated ( Q01151 - ) and maturated ( Q01151 + ) DC . In conclusion , a final maturation of monocyte-derived DC through huCD40LT resulted in a highly homogeneous cell population with enhanced surface marker expression and high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . In addition , the induction of responses to allo or recall antigens presented by huCD40LT maturated DC was comparable to the responses obtained with the DC maturated through P01375 exposure .
