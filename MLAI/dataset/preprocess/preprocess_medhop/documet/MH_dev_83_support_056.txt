Initial experience combining cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition with chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Gemcitabine has recently been shown to be an improvement over 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced disease . It is also a potent radiosensitizer , which has led to the investigation of gemcitabine with concurrent radiotherapy . However , preliminary results indicate that there are significant limitations to this approach in this challenging disease . Pancreatic cancer cells have alterations in many molecular signaling pathways that may be responsible for their resistance to cytotoxic therapy and aggressive behavior . P35354 ( P35354 ) is commonly overexpressed in pancreatic tumors , and preclinical evidence indicates that selective P35354 inhibition enhances both chemotherapy and radiotherapy response , without affecting normal tissue damage . We have initiated preclinical studies as well as a phase I clinical protocol evaluating the combination of gemcitabine and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) with radiotherapy . In preclinical studies , celecelecoxib strongly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of chemoradiation . However , preliminary observations from both the preclinical experiments as well as the clinical protocol have revealed more toxicity with this combination than with gemcitabine and radiotherapy alone . These observations require further study , but are cause for concern when combining gemcitabine , radiotherapy , and celecoxib .
