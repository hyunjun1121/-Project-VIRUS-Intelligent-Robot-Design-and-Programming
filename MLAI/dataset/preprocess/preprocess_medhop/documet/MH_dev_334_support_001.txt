Signaling pathways regulating interleukin-13-stimulated chemokine release from airway smooth muscle . Interleukin ( IL ) -13 receptor activation on airway smooth muscle cells induces eotaxin release and activates multiple signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinases , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( P42226 ) . To examine a requirement for P42226 in mediating P35225 -stimulated eotaxin release we used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) to downregulate endogenous P42226 protein . P42226 antisense ODNs were taken up by about 85 % of cells . Selective downregulation of P42226 protein occurred with antisense ODNs , but not with sense or scrambled ODNs . P51671 release induced by P35225 or P05112 ( 10 ng/ml ) was reduced by 81 +/- 4 and 75 +/- 7 % , respectively , in cells transfected with antisense ODNs ( p < 0.001 ) , but not with a sense ODN or a scrambled ODN . P51671 release induced by IL-1beta was unaffected by P42226 antisense ODN ( p > 0.05 ) . Finally , P35225 - or P05112 -dependent eotaxin release was abolished when inhibitors of both Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 P29323 ( U0126 , 10 microM ) and p38 ( SB202190 , 10 microM ) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were combined in P42226 antisense ODN-transfected cells . In contrast , about 25 % of the response remained when each inhibitor was examined alone in P42226 antisense ODN-treated cells . These data support roles for both P42226 - and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways in mediating eotaxin release from airway smooth muscle by P35225 or P05112 .
