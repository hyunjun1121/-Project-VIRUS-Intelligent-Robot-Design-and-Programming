Novel bioactive metabolites of dipyrone ( metamizol ) . DB04817 is a common antipyretic drug and the most popular non-opioid analgesic in many countries . In spite of its long and widespread use , molecular details of its fate in the body are not fully known . We administered dipyrone orally to mice . Two unknown metabolites were found , viz. the arachidonoyl amides of the known major dipyrone metabolites , 4-methylaminoantipyrine ( 2 ) and 4-aminoantipyrine ( 3 ) . They were identified by P19957 -LC-MS/MS after extraction from the CNS , and comparison with reference substances prepared synthetically . The arachidonoyl amides were positively tested for cannabis receptor binding ( CB(1) and CB(2) ) and cyclooxygenase inhibition ( P23219 and P35354 in tissues and as isolated enzymes ) , suggesting that the endogenous cannabinoid system may play a role in the effects of dipyrone against pain .
