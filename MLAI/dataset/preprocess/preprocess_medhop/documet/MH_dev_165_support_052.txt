Blocking autocrine P15692 signaling by sunitinib , an anti-cancer drug , promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming . Maintaining the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) could be achieved by activating the extrinsic signaling , i.e. , the use of leukemia inhibitory factor ( P15018 ) , or blocking the intrinsic differentiation pathways , i.e. , the use of GSK3 and MEK inhibitors ( 2i ) . Here we found that even in medium supplemented with P15018 , mESCs still tend to differentiate toward meso-endoderm lineages after long-term culture and the culture spontaneously secretes vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ) . Blocking P15692 signaling with sunitinib , an anti-cancer drug and a receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor mainly targeting P15692 receptors ( VEGFRs ) , is capable of maintaining the mESCs in the undifferentiated state without the need for feeder cells or P15018 . DB01268 facilitates the derivation of mESCs from blastocysts , and the mESCs maintained in sunitinib-containing medium remain pluripotent and are able to contribute to chimeric mice . DB01268 also promotes iPSC generation from MEFs with only Oct4 . Knocking down P35968 or blocking it with neutralizing antibody mimicks the effect of sunitinib , indicating that blocking P15692 /VEGFR signaling is indeed beneficial to the self-renewal of mESCs . We also found that hypoxia-inducible factor alpha ( HIF1α ) and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress are involved in the production of P15692 in mESCs . Blocking both pathways inhibits the expression of P15692 and prevents spontaneous differentiation of mESCs . Interestingly , P15018 may also exert its effect by downregulating HIF1α and ER stress pathways and subsequent P15692 expression . These results indicate the existence of an intrinsic differentiation pathway in mESCs by activating the autocrine P15692 signaling . Blocking P15692 signaling with sunitinib or other small molecules help to maintain the mESCs in the ground state of pluripotency .
