P35354 inhibitors -- IBC conference . 12-13 April 1999 , Coronado , CA , USA . The introduction of celecoxib ( DB00482 , Figure 1 ; GD Searle and Co ) as the first cyclooxygenase ( P36551 )2 selective inhibitor in the US and the expected introduction of rofecoxib ( Vioxx ; Merck and Co Inc ) as the first P35354 inhibitor with an acute pain indication , has prompted interest in this class of drugs as a possible therapeutic improvement on dual P23219 / P35354 inhibitor NSAIDs , currently on the market . Recognition that the P35354 enzyme may have a broader role than pain and inflammation has led to studies investigating the efficacy of P35354 inhibitors for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , stroke , cardiovascular disease and colon cancer . Speakers at the second annual conference sponsored by IBC , addressed issues ranging from the basic concepts of P35354 specificity versus selectivity , pathways and regulatory factors related to P35354 expression , the principles underlying the possible broad implications of the P35354 mechanisms , as well as summaries of recently completed clinical trials supporting the clinical efficacy and safety of P35354 inhibitors in humans . The timeliness of this meeting is emphasized by the recent approval of rofecoxib by the FDA Arthritis Advisory panel and the initial reports in the media of toxicity attributed to celecoxib . Preclinical and limited clinical data presented suggest possible therapeutic roles for selective P35354 inhibitors in neurodegeneration due to both AD and stroke , the prevention and treatment of colon cancer , prevention of premature labor , as well as pain and inflammation .
