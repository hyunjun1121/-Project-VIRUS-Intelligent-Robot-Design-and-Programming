P2Y receptor antagonists in thrombosis . The dual role of P47900 and Q9H244 receptors in platelet aggregation by ADP has been firmly established , based on the action of selective inhibitors , gene targeting in mice and human genetic evidence . Both of these receptor subtypes constitute targets for antithrombotic agents , and compounds with a dual action might also be of interest . However , the agents currently on the market ( ticlopidine and clopidogrel ) , or known to be in development ( cangrelor , DB08816 and prasugrel ) , all target the Q9H244 receptor . The thienopyridines ( ticlopidine , clopidogrel and prasugrel ) irreversibly inactivate the Q9H244 receptor via the covalent binding of an active metabolite generated in the liver , while the other compounds are competitive antagonists . DB06441 , an DB00171 derivative , is suitable for intravenous perfusion , whereas DB08816 is in clinical development as an orally active agent .
