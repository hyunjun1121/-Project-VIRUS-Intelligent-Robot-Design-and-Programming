DB04630 stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 activation . The nongenomic effects of aldosterone have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases . DB04630 -induced nongenomic effects are attributable in part to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) , a classical mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase . Q13164 ( Q13164 ) , a newly identified Q96HU1 kinase , has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival . We examined whether aldosterone stimulates Q13164 -mediated proliferation of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells ( RASMCs ) . P08235 ( MR ) expression and localization were evaluated by Western blotting analysis and fluorolabeling methods . P27361 /2 and Q13164 activities were measured by Western blotting analysis with the respective phosphospecific antibodies . Cell proliferation was determined by Alamar Blue colorimetric assay . DB04630 ( 0.1 to 100 nmol/L ) dose-dependently activated Q13164 in RASMCs , with a peak at 30 minutes . To clarify whether aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation is an MR-mediated phenomenon , we examined the effect of eplerenone , a selective MR antagonist , on aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation . DB00700 ( 0.1 to 10 micromol/L ) dose-dependently inhibited aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation in RASMCs . DB04630 also stimulated RASMC proliferation , which was inhibited by eplerenone . DB04630 -mediated phenomena were concluded to be attributable to a nongenomic effect because cycloheximide failed to inhibit aldosterone-induced Q13164 activation . Transfection of dominant-negative Q96HU1 kinase/ P29323 kinase 5 ( Q13163 ) , which is an upstream regulator of Q13164 , partially inhibited aldosterone-induced RASMC proliferation , which was almost completely inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 . In addition to the classical steroid activity , rapid nongenomic effects induced by aldosterone may represent an alternative etiology for vascular diseases such as hypertension .
