Androgens stimulate myogenic differentiation and inhibit adipogenesis in C3H 10T1/2 pluripotent cells through an androgen receptor-mediated pathway . DB00624 supplementation increases skeletal muscle mass and decreases fat mass ; however , the underlying mechanisms are unknown . We hypothesized that testosterone regulates body composition by promoting the commitment of mesenchymal pluripotent cells into myogenic lineage and inhibiting their differentiation into adipogenic lineage . Mouse C3H 10T1/2 pluripotent cells were treated with testosterone ( 0-300 nM ) or dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 , 0-30 nM ) for 0-14 d , and myogenic conversion was evaluated by immunocytochemical staining for early ( MyoD ) and late ( myosin heavy chain II ; MHC ) myogenic markers and by measurements of MyoD and MHC mRNA and protein . Adipogenic differentiation was assessed by adipocyte counting and by measurements of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 ( Q07869 gamma 2 ) mRNA and Q07869 gamma 2 protein and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha . The number of MyoD+ myogenic cells and MHC+ myotubes and MyoD and MHC mRNA and protein levels increased dose dependently in response to testosterone and DB02901 treatment . Both testosterone and DB02901 decreased the number of adipocytes and down-regulated the expression of Q07869 gamma 2 mRNA and Q07869 gamma 2 protein and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha . P10275 mRNA and protein levels were low at baseline but increased after testosterone or DB02901 treatment . The effects of testosterone and DB02901 on myogenesis and adipogenesis were blocked by bicalutamide . Therefore , testosterone and DB02901 regulate lineage determination in mesenchymal pluripotent cells by promoting their commitment to the myogenic lineage and inhibiting their differentiation into the adipogenic lineage through an androgen receptor-mediated pathway . The observation that differentiation of pluripotent cells is androgen dependent provides a unifying explanation for the reciprocal effects of androgens on muscle and fat mass in men .
