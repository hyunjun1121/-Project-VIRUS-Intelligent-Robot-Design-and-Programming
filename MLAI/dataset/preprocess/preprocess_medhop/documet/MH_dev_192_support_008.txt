Anemia in heart and kidney allograft recipients : is there a role for hepcidin ? The production by hepatocytes of hepcidin , a small defensin-like peptide , is modulated in response to anemia , hypoxia , or inflammation . We studied hepcidin as a marker of iron status ( serum iron , ferritin , and soluble receptor of transferrin [ sTfR ] , and as a marker of inflammation among 170 prevalent kidney transplantation ( KT ) patients and 168 prevalent orthotopic heart transplant ( OHT ) patients . In addition , we assessed the prevalence of anemia and its relation to measurements of hepcidin , sTfR , and high-sensitivity P02741 , using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kits . Prevalence of anemia was 37 % in KT patients and 34 % in OHT patients according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) definition . Anemic KT patients displayed significantly higher values of serum creatinine , hepcidin , hsCRP , ferritin , and proteinuria associated with greater use of P42345 and significantly lower Q13216 therapy . The hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . Upon multiple regression analysis eGFR , ferritin , and hsCRP independently predicted hepcidin levels , explaining 78 % of the variation in hepcidin . Anemic OHT patients showed significantly lower Q92565 , red blood cell ( RBC ) , and hemoglobin values and significantly higher creatinine and NT-proBNP content . Upon multiple regression analysis the predictors of serum hepcidin were eGFR and ferritin , which explained 68 % of the variation in hepcidin . The prevalence of anemia is relatively high and not adequately treated ( mainly due to reimbursement regulations ) among heart and kidney allograft recipients . In conclusion , elevated hepcidin levels in heart and kidney transplant recipients suggest subclinical inflammation and impaired kidney function .
