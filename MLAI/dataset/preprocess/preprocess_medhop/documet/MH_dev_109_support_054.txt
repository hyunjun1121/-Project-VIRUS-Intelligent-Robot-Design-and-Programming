Anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant treatment in interventional cardiology . Efforts to improve Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty ( PTCA ) have resulted in the usage of new antiplatelets , and antithrombotic agents . These new agents may increase bleeding complications . However , EPIC , EPILOG and CAPTURE trials showed benefits of DB00054 , a P08514 /IIIa platelets receptor blocker , in high risk PTCA patients . On the other hand , direct thrombin inhibitors , Hirudin and DB02351 , did not clearly show any benefit when compared to heparin in patients with unstable angina undergoing PTCA . Combination of oral antiplatelets , ticlopidine and aspirin , is widely utilized following stent implantation . However , its benefit over aspirin alone has not been demonstrated . This article aims to review mechanisms and benefits of these new agents in cardiovascular field .
