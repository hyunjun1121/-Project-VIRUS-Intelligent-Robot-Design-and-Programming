The A1 allele of the human D2 dopamine receptor gene is associated with increased activity of striatal L-amino acid decarboxylase in healthy subjects . The A1 allele of the TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) of the human dopamine D2 receptor gene ( P14416 ) is associated with a low density of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum . Because of the important role of D2 autoreceptors in regulating dopamine synthesis , we aimed to examine whether subjects with the A1 allele have altered presynaptic dopamine function in the brain . We also studied the effects of two other P14416 polymorphisms , C957 T and -- 141C Ins/Del , which have been suggested to affect D2 receptor levels in brain . The relationships between the TaqIA RFLP , C957 T and -- 141C Ins/Del polymorphisms and striatal dopamine synthesis in 33 healthy Finnish volunteers were studied using positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodopa ( [18F]FDOPA ) , a radiolabelled analog of the dopamine precursor DB01235 . Heterozygous carriers of the A1 allele ( A1/A2 ; 10 subjects ) had significantly higher ( 18 % ) [18F]FDOPA uptake in the putamen than subjects without the A1 allele ( A2/A2 ; 23 subjects ) . C957 T and -- 141C Ins/Del polymorphisms did not significantly affect [18F]FDOPA Ki values . These results demonstrate that the A1 allele of P14416 gene is associated with increased striatal activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase , the final enzyme in the biosynthesis of dopamine and the rate-limiting enzyme for trace amine ( e.g. beta-phenylethylamine ) synthesis . The finding can be explained by lower D2 receptor expression leading to decreased autoreceptor function , and suggests that dopamine and/or trace amine synthesis rate is increased in the brains of A1 allele carriers .
