DB01012 : pharmacological and clinical aspects . The calcium sensing receptor ( P41180 ) is expressed in cells secreting calcium-regulating hormones , in cells involved in calcium transport and in many other tissues , with an as yet not completely defined role . In parathyroid cells , the P41180 stimulation inhibits parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) secretion , synthesis and parathyroid cell proliferation . DB01012 belongs to calcimimetic type II compounds that can interact with P41180 , increasing its affinity for calcium . Clinical studies have proved cinacalcet to be effective in reducing calcium and PTH levels in primary hyperparathyroidism and in reducing PTH , calcium and phosphate in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism owing to chronic renal failure , with a relatively safe profile , the only reported adverse events being hypocalcaemia and gastrointestinal symptoms . However , though calcimimetics do represent a real advancement in the field of the treatment of PTH secretion disturbances , there is a need for clinical trials , which should aim to demonstrate that a better control of biochemical parameters is also matched with better clinical outcomes .
