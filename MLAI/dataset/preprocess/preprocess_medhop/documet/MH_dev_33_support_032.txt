Quantitative study of the interactome of PKCζ involved in the P01133 -induced tumor cell chemotaxis . Chemotaxis plays an important role in metastasis . In our previous studies , we reported that protein kinase C ζ ( PKCζ ) mediated cancer cell chemotaxis by regulating cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell adhesion . To further study the molecular mechanism of chemotaxis , mass spectrometry-based approaches were employed to investigate the interactome of PKCζ and its changes upon stimulation by epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) . As a result , 233 proteins were identified as potential PKCζ binding partners . Label free quantification was applied to examine the quantitative changes of these interactions involved in the P01133 induced chemotaxis . Fifteen identified proteins were enriched and 9 proteins were reduced in the presence of P01133 ( ≥ 1.5 folds , p ≤ 0.05 ) . The interaction between cofilin-1 ( P23528 ) and PKCζ was evidenced and this interaction was enhanced in the P01133 induced chemotaxis signaling transduction . In addition , novel PKCζ interacting proteins potentially related with chemotaxis were characterized , such as isoform 1 of nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) . Furthermore , Western blotting and chemotaxis assays were also applied to validate the proteomics result and explore its biological implications . Collectively , the combination of quantitative proteomics and biological assays provides a powerful strategy for elucidating the signaling pathway of tumor cell chemotaxis .
