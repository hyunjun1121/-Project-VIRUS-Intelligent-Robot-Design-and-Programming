Antihistamine effects on prefrontal cortex activity during working memory process in preschool children : a near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) study . P35367 antagonists ( antihistamines ) are widely used for the treatment of allergic disorders in young children . This study examined the effects of antihistamine on prefrontal cortex activity in preschool children using near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , an emerging brain-imaging method suitable for psychological experiments , especially in young children . We examined the changes of oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex while children performed a spatial working memory task , 3h after taking a first-generation antihistamine ( ketotifen ) , second-generation antihistamine ( epinastine ) , or placebo . Fifteen healthy preschool children ( mean age , 5.5 years ) participated . DB00920 significantly impaired behavioral performance and cortical activation at the lateral prefrontal cortex in the working memory task , compared with epinastine and placebo . There were no sedative effects on neural response or behavioral performance after epinastine administration . This paper demonstrates for the first time differential sedation effects of first- and second-generation antihistamines on brain hemodynamic response in young children . Also discussed is the utility of the NIRS technique in neuropsychopharmacological studies of children .
