Differential regulation of membrane guanylyl cyclases in congestive heart failure : natriuretic peptide receptor ( NPR ) -B , Not P16066 , is the predominant natriuretic peptide receptor in the failing heart . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) and B-type natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) bind natriuretic peptide receptor ( NPR ) -A and decrease blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy by elevating cGMP concentrations . Physiological responses to P01160 and DB04899 are diminished in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) by an unknown mechanism . P23582 ( P09543 ) binding to P20594 decreases cardiac hypertrophy , but the effect of CHF on P20594 is unknown . Here , we measured P01160 / P16066 -dependent and P09543 / P20594 -dependent guanylyl cyclase activities in membranes from failing and nonfailing hearts . Transaortic banding of mice resulted in marked CHF as indicated by increased heart/body weight ratios , increased left ventricular diameters , and decreased ejection fractions . In nonfailed hearts , saturating P01160 concentrations increased particulate guanylyl cyclase activity almost 10-fold , whereas saturating P09543 concentrations increased activity 6.9-fold , or to about 70 % of the P01160 response . In contrast , in failed heart preparations , P09543 elicited twice as much activity as P01160 due to dramatic reductions in P16066 activity without changes in P20594 activity . For the first time , these data indicate that P20594 activity represents a significant and previously unappreciated portion of the natriuretic peptide-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity in the normal heart and that P20594 accounts for the majority of the natriuretic peptide-dependent activity in the failed heart . Based on these findings , we suggest that drugs that target both NPRs may be more beneficial than drugs like nesiritide ( Natrecor ) that target P16066 alone .
