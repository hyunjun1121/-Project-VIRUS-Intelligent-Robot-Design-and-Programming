Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides : secretion during exercise in patients with essential hypertension and modulation by acute angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition . 1. This study examined whether brain and atrial natriuretic peptides ( DB04899 , P01160 ) are secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart , and whether plasma concentrations of DB04899 and P01160 were affected by ergometric exercise in patients with essential hypertension . The effects of temocapril , a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor , on plasma concentrations of these peptides was also examined . 2 . The plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ( ir ) DB04899 and ir- P01160 in the coronary sinus in seven patients with ischaemic heart disease during cardiac catheterization were far greater than values with plasma obtained at the same time from the femoral artery . 3 . The plasma concentrations of ir- DB04899 and ir- P01160 increased with exercise and were correlated with each other . DB08836 reduced the blood pressure and slightly ( but significantly ) decreased the levels of both peptides at rest and during exercise . 4 . The results suggest that DB04899 and P01160 were secreted together through the coronary sinus from the heart . The secretion was increased by exercise and suppressed by acute P12821 inhibition . The increase in these peptides during exercise may reflect a compensatory mechanism against further elevation of blood pressure .
