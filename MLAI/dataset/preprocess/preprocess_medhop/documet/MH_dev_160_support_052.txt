Potential use of P01375 -α inhibitors in systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin , vascular abnormalities and variable involvement of organs . P01375 -α has a central role in initial host response to infections and in the pathogenesis of various systemic immune-mediated diseases . Serum levels of P01375 -α are elevated in patients with SSc and favor the development of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension . Inflammatory arthritis can occur in patients with SSc . DB00065 and etanercept may improve the inflammatory arthritis and disability in SSc . P01375 -α inhibitors reduce the systemic inflammation , improve the endothelial function decreasing the risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension progression and of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events . Physicians need to be aware of the potential risks of tuberculosis reactivation and opportunistic infections . Randomized controlled trials with P01375 -α inhibitors in patients with SSc are needed to confirm the potential role of these agents in the treatment of SSc .
