DB01427 suppresses the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human mononuclear cells . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) exerts a wide spectrum of biological activities and contributes to the pathophysiology of septic shock . Elevated circulating levels of P01375 have also been reported in patients with severe chronic heart failure . We studied the effect of amrinone , a class III cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of acute heart failure , on the synthesis of P01375 in vitro . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers or cells of a permanent monoblast cell line were stimulated for 20 h with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and different doses of amrinone . P01375 production is suppressed in a dose-dependent manner to a minimum of 9 % of controls with 1000 microM of amrinone , reaching half-maximal inhibition at 80 microM amrinone . This effect appears to be mediated via DB02527 , which accumulated nearly twofold in the presence of amrinone . Suppression of P01375 synthesis by therapeutically administered phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as amrinone may contribute to their beneficial effect in the treatment of heart failure .
