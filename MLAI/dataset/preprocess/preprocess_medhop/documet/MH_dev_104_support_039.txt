DB11320 contributes to tissue remodeling via periostin expression . DB11320 is thought to have a critical role in the synthesis of extracellular matrix in skin and may be involved in tissue remodeling of allergic diseases . Recent studies revealed that periostin , a matricelluar protein , contributed to tissue remodeling ; however , a link between periostin and histamine remains unproven . We investigated whether periostin was involved in histamine-induced collagen production . Cultured dermal fibroblasts derived from wild-type ( WT ) or periostin knockout ( PN(-/-) ) mice were stimulated with histamine , and then collagen and periostin production was evaluated . DB11320 induced collagen gene expression in WT fibroblasts in the late phase but not in the early phase , whereas no effect on collagen expression was observed in histamine-stimulated PN(-/-) fibroblasts . In WT fibroblasts , histamine directly induced periostin expression in a dose-dependent manner , and an H1 receptor antagonist blocked both periostin and collagen expression . DB11320 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) through the H1 receptor . Q15063 induction was inhibited by either H1 antagonist or P27361 /2 inhibitor treatment in vitro and was attenuated in P35367 (-/-) mice . Elevated expression of periostin was found in lesional skin from atopic dermatitis patients . These results suggest that histamine mediates periostin induction and collagen production through activation of the H1 receptor-mediated P27361 /2 pathway ; furthermore , histamine may accelerate the chronicity of atopic dermatitis .
