Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil prevents neuroinflammation , lowers beta-amyloid levels and improves cognitive performance in P05067 / P49768 transgenic mice . Memory deficit is a marker of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) that has been highly associated with the dysfunction of cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) signaling and an ongoing inflammatory process . Phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitors prevent the breakdown of cGMP and are currently studied as a possible target for cognitive enhancement . However , it is still unknown whether inhibition of O76074 reversed β-amyloid peptide ( Aβ ) -induced neuroinflammation in P05067 / P49768 transgenic ( Tg P05067 / P49768 ) mice . The present study evaluated the cognitive behaviors , inflammatory mediators , and cGMP/PKG/pCREB signaling in 15-month-old Tg P05067 / P49768 mice and age-matched wild-type ( WT ) mice that were treated with O76074 inhibitor sildenafil and the inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS . In comparison with WT mice , Tg P05067 / P49768 mice were characterized by impaired cognitive ability , neuroinflammatory response , and down-regulated cGMP signaling . DB00203 reversed these memory deficits and cGMP/PKG/pCREB signaling dysfunction ; it also reduced both the soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in the hippocampus . These effects of sildenafil were prevented by intra-hippocampal infusion of the Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS . These results suggest that sildenafil could restore cognitive deficits in Tg P05067 / P49768 mice by the regulation of PKG/pCREB signaling , anti-inflammatory response and reduction of Aβ levels .
