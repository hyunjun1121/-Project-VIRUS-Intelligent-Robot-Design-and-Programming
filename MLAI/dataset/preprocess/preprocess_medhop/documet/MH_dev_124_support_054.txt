Regulation of the human P38936 (waf1/cip1) gene promoter via multiple binding sites for p53 and the vitamin D3 receptor . The main regulator of the human tumor suppresser gene P38936 (waf1/cip1) is the transcription factor p53 , but more recently it has been suggested to be a primary anti-proliferative target for the nuclear receptor P11473 in the presence of its ligand 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) . To identify P11473 responding regions , we analyzed 20 overlapping regions covering the first 7.1 kb of the P38936 (waf1/cip1) promoter in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells using chromatin immuno-precipitation assays ( ChIP ) with antibodies against p53 and P11473 . We confirmed two known p53 binding regions at approximate positions -1400 and -2300 and identified a novel site at position -4500 . In addition , we found three P11473 -associated promoter regions at positions -2300 , -4500 and -6900 , i.e. two regions showed binding for both p53 and P11473 . In silico screening and in vitro binding assays using recombinant and in vitro translated proteins identified five p53 binding sites within the three p53-positive promoter regions and also five DB00136 response elements within the three P11473 -positive regions . Reporter gene assays confirmed the expected responsiveness of the respective promoter regions to the p53 inducer 5-fluorouracil and DB00136 . Moreover , re-ChIP assays confirmed the functionality of the three DB00136 -reponsive promoter regions by monitoring simultaneous occupancy of P11473 with the co-activator proteins CBP , Q15788 and Q15648 . Taken together , we demonstrated that the human P38936 ( ( waf1/cip1 ) ) gene is a primary DB00136 -responding gene with at least three P11473 binding promoter regions , in two of which also p53 co-localizes .
