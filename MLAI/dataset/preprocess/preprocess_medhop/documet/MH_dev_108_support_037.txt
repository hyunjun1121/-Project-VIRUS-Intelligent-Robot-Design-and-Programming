Treatment of ulcerative colitis . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon of unknown cause that is characterized by alternating intervals of active and inactive disease in 80-90 % of patients . The primary goal of treatment is to induce and maintain remission using therapy tailored to the individual patient . The purpose of this review was to describe the management of ulcerative colitis with emphasis on the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) agents . RECENT FINDINGS : Recent research has shown that new anti- P01375 agents , adalimumab ( P00813 ) and DB06674 , are effective in induction of remission and maintenance of remission in patients with extensive ulcerative colitis . In a recent study , infliximab was found to have comparable efficacy to cyclosporine in treatment of acute severe refractory to corticosteroids ulcerative colitis . SUMMARY : Anti- P01375 therapy should be initiated in patients with acute severe refractory to corticosteroids ulcerative colitis and in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis who are not responsive to conventional treatment with aminosalicylates , corticosteroids and immune modulators . Alternatives to infliximab are P00813 and DB06674 . Future research is needed to further assess the long-term efficacy and safety of P00813 and DB06674 in ulcerative colitis .
