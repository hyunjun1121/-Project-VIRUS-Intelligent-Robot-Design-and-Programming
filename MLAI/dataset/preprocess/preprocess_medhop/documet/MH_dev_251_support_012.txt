A granulocytic population with rearranged immunogenotype in chronic myelocytic leukemia blast crisis and Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute leukemia with cross-lineage nature . Two patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia ( CML ) mixed crisis and one with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ( Ph1 + ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) with cross-lineage nature had a considerable number of granulocytes with monoclonally rearranged immunogenotype . The gene configurations of immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) , T-cell receptor beta chain ( TCR beta ) , and gamma chain ( TCR gamma ) in the granulocytic cells were identical to those in the blasts , indicating that both the blasts and the granulocytes were derived from common leukemic progenitors with the IgH gene rearrangements . In a colony assay of cells from in the Ph1 + ALL patient , the leukemic cells showed the potential to differentiate into granulocytes in the presence of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) or granulocyte- P04141 ( DB00099 ) . Interleukin 7 ( P13232 ) exerted synergistic effects on colony and cluster formation in cultures with these cytokines . Further , P08700 , GM- P04141 , and Q99062 gene expression was found in the leukemic cells . Our findings indicate that the Ph1 + common progenitors in these three patients preserved the potential for granulocytic differentiation even after the occurrence of the Ig ( and TCR ) gene rearrangements as the first genomic event in lymphocyte differentiation . The phenomenon of cross-lineage in leukemic cells , at least in Ph1 + leukemia , can be considered to demonstrate the potential of leukemic progenitors to differentiate in multiple directions .
