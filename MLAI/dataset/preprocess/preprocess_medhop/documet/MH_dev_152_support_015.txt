Menadione reduction by pharmacological doses of ascorbate induces an oxidative stress that kills breast cancer cells . Oxidative stress generated by ascorbate-driven menadione redox cycling kills MCF7 cells by a concerted mechanism including glycolysis inhibition , loss of calcium homeostasis , DNA damage and changes in mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) activities . Cell death is mediated by necrosis rather than apoptosis or macroautophagy . Neither 3-methyladenine nor Z-VAD affects cytotoxicity by ascorbate/menadione ( Asc/Men ) . BAPTA-AM , by restoring cellular capacity to reduce MTT , underlines the role of calcium in the necrotic process . Oxidative stress-mediated cell death is shown by the opposite effects of DB06151 and 3-aminotriazole . Moreover , oxidative stress induces DNA damage ( protein poly-ADP-ribosylation and gamma- P16104 phosphorylation ) and inhibits glycolysis . Asc/Men deactivates extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) while activating p38 , suggesting an additional mechanism to kill MCF7 cells . Since ascorbate is taken up by cancer cells and , due to their antioxidant enzyme deficiency , oxidative stress should affect cancer cells to a greater extent than normal cells . This differential sensitivity may have clinical applications .
