The activated targets of P42345 signaling pathway are characteristic for P16234 mutant and wild-type rather than P10721 mutant GISTs . The therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) has been revolutionized by tyrosin kinase inhibitors . Clinicopathologic studies have been conducted to assess therapeutical responses in cases with P10721 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± ( P16234 ) gene mutations . Cell culture data suggest that Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) kinase signaling may be important in GIST . The aim of our study was to determine the activity of the P42345 pathway in a larger series of GISTs ( 108 different cases ) with different exon mutation types . The P10721 and/or P16234 mutation status of 108 GIST patients was analyzed by direct DNA sequencing . Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays using antibodies for phospho-p70S6 kinase , phospho-4EBP1 , and phospho-S6 , which are downstream target proteins of P42345 . DNA sequencing identified 73 cases with mutations of P10721 and 12 cases with P16234 mutations . Wild-type receptors were present in 23 cases . P10721 exon mutations were accompanied by the activation of the P42345 pathway in 28 of 73 ( 38.4 % ) cases , whereas P16234 mutant GISTs showed activation in 10 of 12 ( 83.3 % ) cases . Wild-type cases were accompanied by P42345 activation in 17 of 23 ( 73.9 % ) cases . Our results indicate that the activation of the P42345 pathway is not a general hallmark of GIST with P10721 mutations . However , P42345 signaling seems to be activated in P16234 mutants and in wild-type cases , which suggests that P42345 or upstream P42345 inhibitors may be therapeutically useful in primary resistant GISTs and confirms earlier data that P42345 is a crucial survival pathway in resistant GISTs .
