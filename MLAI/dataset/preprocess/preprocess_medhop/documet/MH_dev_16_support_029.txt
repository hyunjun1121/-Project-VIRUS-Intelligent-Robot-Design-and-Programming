Combined treatment with DB02546 , bortezomib , and clarithromycin for concomitant targeting of aggresome formation and intracellular proteolytic pathways enhances ER stress-mediated cell death in breast cancer cells . The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the autophagy-lysosome pathway are two major intracellular protein degradation systems . We previously reported that clarithromycin ( P62158 ) blocks autophagy flux , and that combined treatment with P62158 and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( BZ ) enhances ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells , whereas treatment with P62158 alone results in almost no cytotoxicity . Since Q9UBN7 is involved in aggresome formation , which is recognized as a cytoprotective response serving to sequester misfolded proteins and facilitate their clearance by autophagy , we further investigated the combined effect of vorinostat ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) ) , which has a potent inhibitory effect for Q9UBN7 , with P62158 and BZ in breast cancer cell lines . DB02546 exhibited some cytotoxicity along with an increased acetylation level of Î±-tubulin , a substrate of Q9UBN7 . Combined treatment of DB02546 , P62158 , and BZ potently enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect compared with treatment using each reagent alone or a combination of two of the three . Expression levels of ER-stress-related genes , including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor P35638 ( P35638 ) , were maximally induced by the simultaneous combination of three reagents . Like breast cancer cell lines , a wild-type murine embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity and maximally up-regulated Chop after combined treatment with DB02546 , P62158 , and BZ ; however , a Chop knockout MEF cell line almost completely canceled this enhanced effect . The specific Q9UBN7 inhibitor tubacin also exhibited a pronounced cytocidal effect with a combination of P62158 plus BZ . These data suggest that simultaneous targeting of intracellular proteolytic pathways and Q9UBN7 enhances ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells .
