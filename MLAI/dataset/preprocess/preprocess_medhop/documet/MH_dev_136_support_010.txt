The ability of sorafenib to inhibit oncogenic PDGFRbeta and P36888 mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Activated tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia , and represent attractive targets for therapy . DB00398 ( BAY43-9006 , Nexavar ) is a small molecule B-RAF inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma , and has been shown to have activity against receptor tyrosine kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) families . We investigated the efficacy of sorafenib at inhibiting mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRbeta , P10721 , and P36888 , which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies . DESIGN AND METHODS : We tested the effect of sorafenib on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by P41212 -PDGFRbeta , P36888 with an internal tandem duplication or D835Y point mutation , and the P10721 (D816V) mutant . The direct effect of sorafenib on the activity of these kinases and their downstream signaling was tested using phospho-specific antibodies . RESULTS : We show that sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of P41212 -PDGFRbeta and P36888 mutants , including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other P36888 inhibitors . DB00398 induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13 , both expressing P36888 with an internal tandem duplication , whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines . The imatinib-resistant P10721 (D816V) mutant , associated with systemic mastocytosis , was found to be resistant to sorafenib . INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS : These results warrant further clinical studies of sorafenib for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of PDGFRbeta and P36888 .
