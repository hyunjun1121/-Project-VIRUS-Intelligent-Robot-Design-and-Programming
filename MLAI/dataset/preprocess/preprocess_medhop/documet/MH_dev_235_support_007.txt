Long-term outcomes in a family with nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis . We report a familial case of the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis ( NSIAD ) , including 30-year followup data on two patients . The proband and one maternal uncle presented in their infancy with severe recurrent hyponatremia , and clinical pictures consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH ) in the absence of an elevated DB00067 level . They were both confirmed to be hemizygous for the R137C mutation on the P30518 gene ( P30518 ) , the same locus of the gain of function mutation demonstrated in the original reports of this condition . The proband 's mother was identified as an asymptomatic carrier of this X-linked condition . Our case describes a favourable long-term outcome for NSIAD , in particular , successful treatment with oral urea during the infancy period , and with self-regulated precautions on fluid intake into adult life .
