Differential induction of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 2 in ectopic endometrium . According to the transplantation theory , endometriosis develops from endometrial fragments that are retrogradely menstruated into the peritoneal cavity . In order to develop into endometriotic lesions , they have to connect to the vascular system by angiogenesis , probably involving matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) as key enzymes in extracellular matrix remodelling . A model of endometriosis using the chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) of chick embryos was established . Eutopic endometrium from healthy women was transferred to the P62158 and cultivated ectopically for up to 3 days . Before transplantation and after 24 , 48 and 72 h of culture on the P62158 , total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed . Human P03956 ( interstitial collagenase ) and P08253 ( gelatinase A ) mRNA expression was assessed by competitive PCR . Results were normalized to the content of human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( P04406 ) mRNA . In eutopic endometrium , 0.29 amol P03956 mRNA and 0.42 fmol P08253 mRNA per fmol P04406 mRNA were found . Relative P03956 mRNA concentrations increased strongly after culture on the P62158 , while P08253 mRNA levels were nearly unaltered . This differential regulation suggests different roles of these enzymes in the angiogenesis of ectopic endometrial fragments and during the development of endometriosis .
