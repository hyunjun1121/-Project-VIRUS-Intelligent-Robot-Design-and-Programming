Synaptic and photoreceptor components in retinal pigment epithelial cell transplanted retinas of Royal College of Surgeons dystrophic rats . Plexiform layer synaptic and photoreceptor cell components were investigated in retinas of Royal College of Surgeons ( RCS ) dystrophic rats transplanted with normal retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells by immunocytochemistry using previously characterized monoclonal antibodies . In retinas of normal adult rats and Q96AT9 -cell transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats , HNK-1 , a marker for a carbohydrate of the neural cell adhesion molecule ( N- P62158 ) , was detected immunocytochemically in the inner and outer plexiform layers and ganglion cell bodies and their axons . HNK-1 was also detected in the inner plexiform layer of nontreated retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats , but was reduced to scattered patches in the outer plexiform layer . In addition , immunoreactivity for the SVP-38 antibody recognizing synaptophysin was found in both plexiform layers of normal adult rat retinas and Q96AT9 -transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats . Furthermore , photoreceptor cell bodies and their inner and outer segments were immunostained for the opsin monoclonal antibody P07949 -P1 in retinas of normal adult rats and Q96AT9 -cell transplanted retinas of 4 month-old RCS rats . However , in nontreated retinas of 4-month-old RCS rats , only immunostained debris material was detected . These results strongly suggest that normal Q96AT9 transplants not only rescue photoreceptor cells in RCS rats , but also maintain an essential functional capacity , in this case , synaptic components in the plexiform layers .
