Curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate inhibit the cancer stem cell phenotype via down-regulation of P40763 -NFκB signaling . BACKGROUND/AIM : The cancer stem cell ( CSC ) model postulates the existence of a small proportion of cancer cells capable of sustaining tumor formation , self-renewal and differentiation . Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( P40763 ) signaling is known to be selectively activated in breast CSC populations . However , it is yet to be determined which molecular mechanisms regulate P40763 signaling in CSCs and what chemopreventive agents are effective for suppressing CSC growth . The aim of this study was to examine the potential efficacy of curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) against CSC and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of their anticancer effects . MATERIALS AND METHODS : To suppress the CSC phenotype , two breast cancer cell lines ( MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells transfected with P04626 ) were treated with curcumin ( 10 μM ) with or without EGCG ( 10 μM ) for 48 h . We used tumor-sphere formation and wound-healing assays to determine CSC phenotype . To quantify CSC populations , Fluorescence-activated cell sorting profiling was monitored . P40763 phosphorylation and interaction with Nuclear Factor-kB ( NFkB ) were analyzed by performing western blot and immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS : Combined curcumin and EGCG treatment reduced the cancer stem-like Cluster of differentiation 44 ( P16070 ) -positive cell population . Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that curcumin and EGCG specifically inhibited P40763 phosphorylation and P40763 -NFkB interaction was retained . CONCLUSION : This study suggests that curcumin and EGCG function as antitumor agents for suppressing breast CSCs . P40763 and NFκB signaling pathways could serve as targets for reducing CSCs leading to novel targeted-therapy for treating breast cancer .
