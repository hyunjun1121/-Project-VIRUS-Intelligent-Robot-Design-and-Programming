P62937 is upregulated in small cell lung cancer and activates P27361 /2 signal . P62937 ( CypA ) , a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) , was originally identified as the intracellular receptor for cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) . Recently , correlations of CypA with tumor pathogenesis have been studied . Here , we studied the expression of CypA and its receptor CD147 in several kinds of lung cancer cells as well as a normal lung cell and found that in H446 cell , a kind of small cell lung cancer cell , the expression are the highest . The exogeneous CypA protein can substantially stimulate H446 cell growth in dependence on its PPIase activity . We also showed that CypA protein can stimulate P27361 /2 signal in dose and time dependent manners and almost has no effect to p38 and JNK signals . Elucidation of the precise role of CypA in these pathways may lead to new targeted therapies for small cell lung cancer .
