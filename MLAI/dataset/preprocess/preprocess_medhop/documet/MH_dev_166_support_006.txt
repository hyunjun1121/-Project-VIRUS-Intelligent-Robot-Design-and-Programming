Interferon-gamma upregulates the c- DB00134 /hepatocyte growth factor receptor expression in alveolar epithelial cells . In the repair process after lung injury , the regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells plays an important role by covering the damaged alveolar wall and preventing the activated fibroblasts from invading the intra- alveolar spaces . P14210 ( P14210 ) is a potent mitogen for alveolar epithelial cells and has been reported to be capable of repressing the fibrosing process by connecting to the c- DB00134 / P08581 on alveolar epithelial cells . However , it has been reported that the c- DB00134 expression was downregulated in an acute phase of lung injury , which may limit the effect of P14210 for therapeutic use . In the present study we observed that interferon ( IFN ) -gamma upregulates the c- DB00134 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein expression in A549 alveolar epithelial cells . We analyzed the mechanism of this upregulation and found that P01579 enhances the transcription of the c-met proto-oncogene , and that it does not prolong the stability of the c- DB00134 mRNA . P14210 is known to act as a motogen as well as a mitogen for epithelial cells . We also found that the migratory activity of A549 cells induced by P14210 is strongly enhanced by preincubation with P01579 . Finally , we administered recombinant P01579 to C57BL/6 mice and confirmed that this upregulation is also observed in vivo . These results suggest that the combination of P14210 and P01579 could be a new therapeutic approach for fibrosing pulmonary diseases .
