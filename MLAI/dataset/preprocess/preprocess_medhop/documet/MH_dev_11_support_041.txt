Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat in heart failure . The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of omapatrilat , administered orally ( 25 mg ) or intravenously ( 10 mg ) in 19 New York Heart Association class II and class III congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patients versus 17 healthy controls matched for age , race , gender , and weight . The plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) increased by approximately 20 % and 30 % in CHF and control subjects , respectively , at 4 hours after intravenous or oral omapatrilat administration . Similar elevation in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration ( 25 % to 35 % ) and P01160 urinary excretion ( 21 ng/24 h to 22 ng/24 h ) was seen in all treatment groups after omapatrilat administration . P12821 activity was > 90 % inhibited at 4 hours after dosing and remained approximately 60 % to 70 % inhibited at 24 hours after dosing . The levels of endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 remained unchanged after oral or intravenous administration of omapatrilat . The maximal reduction in seated blood pressure compared with baseline was similarfor CHF and control subjects . Clinical pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in both groups after intravenous dosing , but maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve were elevated in CHF patients compared with controls after oral dosing . DB00886 was well tolerated ; differences in systemic exposure and metabolism between CHF patients and controls did not appear to be clinically significant .
