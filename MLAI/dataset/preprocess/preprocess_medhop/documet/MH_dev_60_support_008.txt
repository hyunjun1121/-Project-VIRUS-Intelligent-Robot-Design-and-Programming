Determination of fenofibric acid concentrations by HPLC after anion exchange solid-phase extraction from human serum . Triglycerides are increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . Research efforts to identify sources of variability in triglyceride-lowering response to the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate require quantification of the active acidic form of this Q07869 agonist . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction , in combination with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , rapidly and accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations . Chromatographic separation under isocratic conditions , with use of ultraviolet detection at 285 nm , provides clean baseline and sharp peaks for clofibric acid , 1-napthyl acetic acid ( internal standards ) , and fenofibric acid . Commonly prescribed and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) were screened for assay interference , and the assay was employed to quantify fenofibric acid in more than 800 human subject specimens . DB01039 analysis was found to be linear over the range of 0.5 to 40 mg/L and was validated with either internal standard . Accuracies ranged from 98.65 % to 102.4 % , whereas the within- and between-day precisions ranged from 1.0 % to 2.2 % and 2.0 % to 6.2 % , respectively . NSAIDs had minimal interference with the assay , which succeeded in quantifying fenofibric acid in more than 843 of 846 serum samples from human subjects , many taking a variety of coadministered medications . Anion-exchange solid-phase extraction in combination with reverse-phase HPLC accurately determines steady-state fenofibric acid serum concentrations in humans without interference from NSAIDs or commonly administered medications . This method is suitable for quantification of fenofibric acid for clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with dyslipidemia .
