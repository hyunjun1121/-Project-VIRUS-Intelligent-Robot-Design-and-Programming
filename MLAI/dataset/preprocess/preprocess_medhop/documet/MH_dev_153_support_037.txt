Novel cinnamyl hydroxyamides and 2-aminoanilides as histone deacetylase inhibitors : apoptotic induction and cytodifferentiation activity . Four novel series of cinnamyl-containing histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors 1-4 are described , containing hydroxamate ( 1 and 3 ) or 2-aminoanilide ( 2 and 4 ) derivatives . When screened against class I ( maize HD1-B and human Q13547 ) and class II ( maize HD1-A and human P56524 ) HDACs , most hydroxamates and 2-aminoanilides displayed potent and selective inhibition toward class I enzymes . Immunoblotting analyses performed in U937 leukemia cells generally revealed high acetyl-H3 and low acetyl-α-tubulin levels . Exceptions are compounds 3 f-i , 3 m-o , and 4 k , which showed higher tubulin acetylation than DB02546 . In U937 cells , cell-cycle blockade in either the G₂/M or G₁/S phase was observed with 1-4 . Five hydroxamates ( compounds 1 h-l ) effected a two- to greater than threefold greater percent apoptosis than DB02546 , and in the CD11c cytodifferentiation test some 2-aminoanilides belonging to both series 2 and 4 were more active than MS-275 . The highest-scoring derivatives in terms of apoptosis ( 1 k , 1 l ) or cytodifferentiation ( 2 c , 4 n ) also showed antiproliferative activity in U937 cells , thus representing valuable tools for study in other cancer contexts .
