High-dose aspirin in dogs increases vascular resistance with limited additional anti-platelet effect when combined with potent Q9H244 inhibition . INTRODUCTION : With the arrival of the potent Q9H244 antagonists , ticagrelor and prasugrel , the need for co-treatment with aspirin in acute coronary syndromes must be re-examined . This study assessed whether high-dose aspirin : a ) provides additional anti-platelet efficacy , assessed in vivo and ex vivo , when combined with Q9H244 inhibition ; and/or b ) has a negative effect on vascular function . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Using an anaesthetized dog model of thrombosis , the effects of aspirin ( 50mg/kg ) in addition to clopidogrel and ticagrelor were evaluated at two levels of Q9H244 inhibition , maximal ( â‰¥96 % ) and sub-maximal ( ~80 % ) , as assessed by ex vivo ADP-induced whole blood impedence aggregometry . RESULTS : In the absence of aspirin , maximal and sub-maximal Q9H244 inhibition inhibited arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation by approximately 80 % and 24 % , respectively , without affecting platelet TXA2 formation . During maximal Q9H244 inhibition , aspirin provided less additional inhibition of ex vivo arachidonic acid- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation , as compared with sub-maximal Q9H244 inhibition , without additional anti-thrombotic effect in vivo . DB00945 significantly decreased in vivo DB01240 production ( 27 % ) and increased vascular resistance ( 16 % ) , independently of Q9H244 antagonism . CONCLUSION : In the dog , Q9H244 antagonists inhibit TXA2-mediated platelet-aggregation independently of aspirin . DB00945 provides less additional anti-platelet effects during maximal compared with sub-maximal Q9H244 inhibition but increases vascular resistance .
