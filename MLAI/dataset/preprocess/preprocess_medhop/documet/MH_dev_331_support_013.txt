Receptor kinase inhibitors target NSCLC : two antibodies and a small-molecule MET inhibitor . Joining cetuximab , sorafenib , afatinib , intedanib , and crizotinib in phase III development for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) are ramucirumab ( developed by ImClone , a subsidiary of Lilly ) , necitumumab ( developed by ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb ) , and tivantinib ( ARQ 197 , developed by ArQule and Daiichi Sankyo ) . DB09559 is a second-generation anti- P00533 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) similar to cetuximab . Enrollment has been stopped in one of two necitumumab phase III trials because of safety concerns . DB05578 is an anti- P35968 mAb targeting the same pathway as bevacizumab . Although the phase II safety data for ramucirumab appear better than the data for necitumumab , fewer phase III data are available . Tivantinib is a highly selective , orally available MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor . MET is overexpressed in 61 % of NSCLC cases . Although tivantinib is the last of the three agents discussed here to enter phase III , its phase II results are the most robust .
