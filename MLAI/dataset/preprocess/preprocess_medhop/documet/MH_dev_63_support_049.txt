P35443 polymorphism ( A387P ) predicts cardiovascular risk in postinfarction patients with high HDL cholesterol and P02741 levels . Few studies are available in human populations investigating involvement of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress-related dysfunctional transformation of high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) in establishing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk . To this end , the current work investigated a subgroup of post-infarction patients at high-risk for recurrent events defined by high levels of HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) and concurrently high levels of P02741 ( CRP ) . P35443 ( P07996 -4 ) , a matricellular protein of vessel walls associated with inflammation , was investigated in terms of CVD risk using multivariable modelling with a well-characterised functional genetic polymorphism of P35443 ( A387P , rs1866389 ) along with previously demonstrated risk-related functional genetic polymorphisms of P13498 ( C242T , rs4673 ) and P11597 ( TaqIB , rs708272 ) , and a set of blood markers . Results revealed risk-association for the gain-of-function P-allele of the P35443 polymorphism ( hazard ratio 2.00 , 95 % confidence interval 1.10-3.65 , p=0.024 ) . Additionally , P04275 was associated with D-dimer levels in the higher-risk P allele patients suggestive of a connection between endothelial dysfunction and thrombogenesis . In conclusion , P07996 -4 , a matricellular protein involved in regulating vascular inflammation , plays a role in establishing recurrent coronary risk in post-infarction patients with high levels of HDL-C and CRP . Further studies should focus on additional effects of vascular inflammatory processes on anti-atherogenic functionality of HDL particles .
