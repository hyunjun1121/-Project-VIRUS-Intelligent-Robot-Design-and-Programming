Monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 , P00533 ) autocrine pathway contributes to a number of highly relevant processes in cancer development and progression , including cell proliferation , regulation of apoptotic cell death , angiogenesis and metastatic spread . The crucial role that P00533 plays in human cancers has led to an extensive search for selective inhibitors of its signaling pathway . The results of a large body of preclinical studies and clinical trials thus far conducted suggest that targeting the P00533 could bring a significant contribution to cancer therapy . A variety of different approaches are currently being used to target the P00533 . The most promising strategies in clinical development include monoclonal antibodies , to prevent ligand binding , and small molecules inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity , that inhibit autophosphorylation and downstream intracellular signaling . Several blocking monoclonal antibodies against the P00533 have been developed . Among these , IMC-225 is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody that has been the first anti- P00533 targeted therapy to enter clinical evaluation in cancer patients in Phase II and III studies , alone or in combination with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy . However , other antibodies against P00533 have demonstrated antitumor activity in several preclinical models of human cancer and are currently under investigation in the clinical setting , such as ICR62 , DB01269 and EMD72000 . This review will focus on all the preclinical data available on monoclonal antibodies engineered against the P01133 receptor .
