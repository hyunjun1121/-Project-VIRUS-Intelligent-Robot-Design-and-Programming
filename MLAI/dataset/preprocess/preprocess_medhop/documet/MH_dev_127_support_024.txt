Pharmacological properties of thalidomide and its analogues . Thalidomide and its immunomodulatory imide drugs ( IMiDs ) analogues DB00480 ( DB00480 , DB00480 ) and CC-4047 ( Actimid , DB08910 ) have been used as anti-inflammatory and anticancerous drugs in the recent years . Thalidomide and IMiDs inhibit the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukins ( IL ) 1-beta , 6 , 12 , and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) . They also costimulate primary human T , NKT and NK lymphocytes inducing their proliferation , cytokine production , and cytotoxic activity . On the other hand , the compounds are anti-angiogenic , anti-proliferative , and pro-apoptotic . Thalidomide analogues have been used as inhibitors of alpha glucosidase and could be potential drugs for diabetes treatment . In this review , we explore the current trend of the different structures , the new patents , and the possible new applications in different pathologies .
