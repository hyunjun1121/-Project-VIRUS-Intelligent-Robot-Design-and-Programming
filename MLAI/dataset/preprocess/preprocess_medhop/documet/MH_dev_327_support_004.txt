DB08881 resistance selects for highly malignant brain and lung-metastasizing melanoma cells . V600E being the most common mutation in P15056 , leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway . The majority of V600E P15056 positive melanoma patients treated with the P15056 inhibitor vemurafenib showed initial good clinical responses but relapsed due to acquired resistance to the drug . The aim of the present study was to identify possible biomarkers associated with the emergence of drug resistant melanoma cells . To this end we analyzed the differential gene expression of vemurafenib-sensitive and vemurafenib resistant brain and lung metastasizing melanoma cells . The major finding of this study is that the in vitro induction of vemurafenib resistance in melanoma cells is associated with an increased malignancy phenotype of these cells . Resistant cells expressed higher levels of genes coding for cancer stem cell markers ( Q9UGL1 , CD271 and P02751 ) as well as genes involved in drug resistance ( Q9UNQ0 ) , cell invasion and promotion of metastasis ( P03956 and P08253 ) . We also showed that drug-resistant melanoma cells adhere better to and transmigrate more efficiently through lung endothelial cells than drug-sensitive cells . The former cells also alter their microenvironment in a different manner from that of drug-sensitive cells . Biomarkers and molecular mechanisms associated with drug resistance may serve as targets for therapy of drug-resistant cancer .
