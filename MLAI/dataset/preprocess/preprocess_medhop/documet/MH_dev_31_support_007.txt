Pharmacological modulation of myocardial tumor necrosis factor alpha production by phosphodiesterase inhibitors . Phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitors are used as therapeutic agents for management of congestive heart failure . PDE inhibitors are potent inotropic and vasodilator drugs , which have also been shown to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) production . P01375 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has the ability to produce cardiac depressant and other cardiovascular effects in many disease conditions . P01375 levels are elevated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure , and it is possible that P01375 may play a role in this condition . The effects of PDE inhibitors on P01375 secretion from rat heart were evaluated in this study . Rat left ventricle was minced and incubated for 4 hr with various PDE inhibitors , and the amount of P01375 secretion was evaluated by cytotoxicity assay . Ro-20 , 1724 , etazolate , amrinone , milrinone and pentoxifylline inhibited unstimulated P01375 production , with IC50 values of 1.87 , 2.07 , 13.9 , 153 and 201 microM , respectively . Lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion from rat left ventricle was also evaluated in this study . DB01427 , milrinone and pentoxifylline inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion , with IC50 values of 14.8 , 81.6 and 748 microM , respectively , whereas Ro-2D , 1724 and etazolate had no effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced P01375 secretion . These results demonstrated that P01375 was secreted from rat left ventricle after 4 hr and different pharmacological manipulations were able to inhibit the secretion of P01375 from left ventricle . These initial pharmacological results may provide an important tool for further investigation into the beneficial effects of PDE inhibitors in congestive heart failure or other conditions where P01375 levels are elevated .
