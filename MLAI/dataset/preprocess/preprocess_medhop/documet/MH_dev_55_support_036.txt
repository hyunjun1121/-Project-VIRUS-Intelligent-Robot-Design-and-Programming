[ Comparative study of somatic oncogene mutations in normal thyroid tissues and thyroid neoplasms ] . It is established that numerous somatic oncogene mutation ( P15056 , P01111 , P01112 , P01116 ) and gene translocations ( P07949 /PTC , Q06710 / P37231 ) are associated with the development of thyroid cancer . In this study 22 intraoperative thyroid tissue samples ( 11 pathologic and 11 normal ) were examined . Somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed by LigthCycler melting method , while translocations were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction technique . In tumorous sample 3 P15056 , 2 P01111 and one P01112 mutations were found , as well as one P07949 / Q13635 translocation . Results confirm international data showing that these oncogene mutations and translocations are linked to thyroid cancer . Cytological examination completed with genetic data may support the diagnosis of thyroid malignancies . In addition , genetic alterations may indicate malignant transformation and may become prognostic factors in future .
