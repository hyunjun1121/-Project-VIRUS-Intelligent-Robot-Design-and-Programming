Apotransferrin decreases the response of oligodendrocyte progenitors to PDGF and inhibits the progression of the cell cycle . In the CNS , transferrin ( Tf ) is expressed by the oligodendroglial cells ( OLGcs ) and is essential for their development . We have previously shown that apotransferrin ( aTf ) accelerates maturation of OLGcs in vivo as well as in vitro . The mechanisms involved in this action appear to be complex and have not been completely elucidated . The aim of this study was to investigate if Tf participates in the regulation of the cell cycle of oligodendroglial progenitor cells ( OPcs ) . Primary cultures of OPcs were treated with aTf and/or with different combinations of mitogenic factors . Cell cycle progression was studied by BrdU incorporation , flow cytometry and by the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins . Apotransferrin decreased the number of BrdU+ cells , increasing the cell cycle time and decreasing the number of cells in S phase . The cell cycle inhibitors p27kip1 , p21cip1 and p53 were increased , and in agreement with these results , the activity of the complexes involved in P55008 -S progression ( cyclin D/ P11802 , cyclin E/ P24941 ) , was dramatically decreased . Apotransferrin also inhibited the mitogenic effects of PDGF and PDGF/IGF on OPcs , but did not affect their proliferation rate in the presence of P09038 , P09038 /PDGF or P09038 /IGF . Our results indicate that inhibition of the progression of the cell cycle of OPcs by aTf , even in the presence of PDGF , leads to an early beginning of the differentiation program , evaluated by different maturation markers ( O4 , GC and MBP ) and by morphological criteria . The modulation by aTf of the response of OPcs to PDGF supports the idea that this glycoprotein might act as a key regulator of the OLGc lineage progression .
