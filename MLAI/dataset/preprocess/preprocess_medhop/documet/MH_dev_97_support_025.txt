A novel thrombopoietin-stem-cell factor fusion protein possesses enhanced potential in stimulating megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation . P07202 ( thrombopoietin ) and P21583 ( stem-cell factor ) are functionally related cytokines with overlapping but distinct haematopoietic effects . In the present study , a novel P07202 - P21583 fusion protein that combined the complementary biological effects of P07202 and P21583 into a single molecule was expressed in , and purified from , Sf9 [ Spodoptera frugiperda ( fall armyworm ) ] insect cells . The specific activity of rhTPO ( recombinant human P07202 ) - P21583 in megakaryoblastic Mo7e cell proliferation assays was 2.90+/-0.35 x 10(7) units/micromol , approx . 1.7 times as high as that of rhTPO . The specific activity of rhTPO- P21583 in TF-1 cells proliferation assays was 7.10+/-0.95 x 10(6) units/micromol , approx . 1.2 times as high as that of rhSCF ( recombinant human P21583 ) . In a megakaryocyte-colony-forming assay using human peripheral-blood P28906 (+) cells , the P21583 moiety of rhTPO- P21583 worked in a synergistic way to augment the colony number and exhibited a higher potential to stimulate megakaryocyte colony growth . According to the results of EMSA ( electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ) and semi-quantitative RT ( reverse transcriptase ) -PCR , the synergistic effects of the P21583 moiety were also reflected in increased P42229 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ) DNA binding and enhanced up-regulation of P38936 expression in Mo7e cells treated by rhTPO- P21583 , suggesting that rhTPO- P21583 could be more potent in promoting megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation .
