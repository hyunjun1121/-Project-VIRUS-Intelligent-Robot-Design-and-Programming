P22888 expression in leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata . BACKGROUND : Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata has been attributed to estrogen stimulation and is seen only rarely in postmenopausal women . In such cases , pathogenesis is uncertain . CASE : Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata tumors were resected from a postmenopausal woman . She was receiving tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer and had bilateral ovarian Brenner tumors . Estrogen and progesterone receptors were detected . Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that LH receptors were present . CONCLUSION : DB00044 receptors were identified in leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata in one woman . Levels of DB00094 and LH increase after menopause , and immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of LH receptors , so gonadotropin rather than estrogen stimulation might have contributed to development of leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata in this uncommon case .
