Genetic polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A and 1B affect responses to infliximab in Japanese patients with Crohn 's disease . BACKGROUND : Tumour necrosis factor alpha is the key inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn 's disease . DB00065 , a chimaeric monoclonal antibody of tumour necrosis factor-alpha is successfully used for the treatment of Crohn 's disease , although the response to infliximab therapy differs among patients . The genetic background of the individual may partially explain the differences of the responsiveness . AIM : To investigate whether the polymorphisms in these genes are associated with the response to infliximab treatment as tumour necrosis factor-alpha exerts its biological activity through P01375 receptor superfamily 1A and 1B . METHODS : Eighty Crohn 's disease patients were enrolled in the study and classified into responder and nonresponder according to the efficacy of infliximab treatment . Single nucleotide polymorphisms of P01375 receptor superfamily 1A ( rs767455 and rs4149570 ) and P01375 receptor superfamily 1B ( rs1061622 , rs1061624 and rs3397 ) were determined . RESULTS : The minor allele carrier of rs767455 showed a significant association with a lack of efficacy compared to the major genotype ( OR = 0.26 ; 95 % CI : 0.08-0.91 ) . A P01375 receptor superfamily 1B haplotype inferred by rs1061624 and rs3397 also showed significant differences in the distribution between responder and nonresponder ( P = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that tumour necrosis factor receptor genotypes may be involved in the different responses to infliximab in Japanese patients with Crohn 's disease .
