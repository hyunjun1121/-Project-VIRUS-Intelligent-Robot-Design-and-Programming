Activation of the Q969V6 /actin signaling pathway induces hormonal escape in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines . P03372 alpha ( ERα ) is generally considered to be a good prognostic marker because almost 70 % of ERα-positive tumors respond to anti-hormone therapies . Unfortunately , during cancer progression , mammary tumors can escape from estrogen control , resulting in resistance to treatment . In this study , we demonstrate that activation of the actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 ( Q969V6 ) signaling pathway promotes the hormonal escape of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines . The actin/ Q969V6 signaling pathway is silenced in differentiated ERα-positive breast cancer MCF-7 and T47D cell lines and active in ERα-negative P50135 -3522 DB00451 -2 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells , which have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition . We showed that Q969V6 activation in MCF-7 cells , either by modulating actin dynamics or using Q969V6 mutants , down-regulates ERα expression and abolishes E2-dependent cell growth . Interestingly , the constitutively active form of Q969V6 represses PR and P04626 expression in these cells and increases the expression of HB- P01133 , TGFβ , and amphiregulin growth factors in an E2-independent manner . The resulting expression profile ( ER- , PR- , P04626 - ) typically corresponds to the triple-negative breast cancer expression profile .
