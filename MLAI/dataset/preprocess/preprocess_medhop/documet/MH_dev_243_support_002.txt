Effect of the O00206 antagonist eritoran on retinochoroidal inflammatory damage in a rat model of endotoxin-induced inflammation . PURPOSE : We investigated the effect of eritoran , a O00206 antagonist , on retinochoroidal inflammatory damage in an endotoxin-induced inflammatory rat model . METHODS : Endotoxin-induced inflammatory model was obtained by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Group 1 had control rats ; in groups 2-3 LPS and 0.5 mg/kg sterile saline were injected ; and in groups 4-5 LPS and 0.5 mg/kg eritoran were injected . Blood samples were taken and eyes were enucleated after 12 hours ( h ) ( groups 2 and 4 ) or 24 hours ( Groups 3 and 5 ) . P01375 -α ( P01375 -α ) and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) levels in the serum and retinochoroidal tissue and nuclear factor kappa-B ( NFκB ) levels in retinochoroidal tissue were determined . Histopathological examination was performed and retinochoroidal changes were scored . RESULTS : DB04933 treatment resulted in lower levels of P01375 -α , MDA , and NFκB after 12 h which became significant after 24 h . Serum P01375 -α and retinochoroidal tissue NFκB levels were similar to control animals at the 24th h of the study . DB04933 significantly reversed histopathological damage after 24 h . CONCLUSIONS : DB04933 treatment resulted in less inflammatory damage in terms of serum and retinochoroidal tissue parameters .
