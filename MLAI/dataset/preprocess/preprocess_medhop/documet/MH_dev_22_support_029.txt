Characterization of P04626 status by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . The use of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( P04626 ) gene amplification and overexpression as a molecular predictive marker has become critically important for proper selection of breast cancer patients for treatment with targeted therapeutic agents such as trastuzumab , lapatinib , pertuzumab , and DB05773 . A high level of sensitivity and specificity of molecular tests for this alteration is desirable . The American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathology have jointly established consensus guidelines to standardize characterization of this alteration in breast cancers . This chapter provides a brief overview of pre-analytic and analytical processing of breast specimens as well as subsequent molecular evaluation for P04626 status .
