P12004 D1 inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated adipogenesis through histone deacetylase recruitment . The cyclin D1 gene encodes the labile serum-inducible regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein . Overexpression of cyclin D1 promotes cellular proliferation and normal physiological levels of cyclin D1 function to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vivo . We have previously shown that cyclin D1 inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )gamma-dependent activity through a cyclin-dependent kinase- and retinoblastoma protein-binding-independent mechanism . In this study , we determined the molecular mechanism by which cyclin D1 regulated PPARgamma function . Herein , murine embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) differentiation by PPARgamma ligand was associated with a reduction in histone deacetylase ( Q13547 ) activity . P12004 D1-/- MEFs showed an increased propensity to undergo differentiation into adipocytes . Genetic deletion of cyclin D1 reduced Q13547 activity . Reconstitution of cyclin D1 into the cyclin D1-/- MEFs increased Q13547 activity and blocked PPARgamma-mediated adipogenesis . PPARgamma activity was enhanced in cyclin D1-/- cells . Reintroduction of cyclin D1 inhibited basal and ligand-induced PPARgamma activity and enhanced HDAC repression of PPARgamma activity . P12004 D1 bound HDAC in vivo and preferentially physically associated with Q13547 , Q92769 , O15379 , and Q9UQL6 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that cyclin D1 enhanced recruitment of Q13547 and O15379 and histone methyltransferase O43463 to the Q07869 response element of the lipoprotein lipase promoter and decreased acetylation of total histone H3 and histone H3 lysine 9 . Collectively , these studies suggest an important role of cyclin D1 in regulation of PPARgamma-mediated adipocyte differentiation through recruitment of HDACs to regulate Q07869 response element local chromatin structure and PPARgamma function .
