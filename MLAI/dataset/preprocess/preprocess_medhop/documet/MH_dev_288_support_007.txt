Anti- P04275 aptamer DB05202 for refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . BACKGROUND : Plasma exchange is the main therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) . No treatments other than plasma exchange have been documented to be effective nor are approved for treatment of TTP . The anti- P04275 ( P04275 ) aptamer DB05202 effectively inhibits P04275 activity in plasma samples of TTP patients and thus shear-dependent platelet ( Q02083 ) function as measured by the Q02083 function analyzer PFA-100 ( Dade Behring ) . It was hypothesized that DB05202 would offer a potentially effective treatment option for a critically ill patient , refractory to standard care . CASE REPORT : A 39-year-old male patient with idiopathic TTP , refractory to daily plasma exchange , rituximab , steroids , and splenectomy , was additionally treated with a continuous infusion of the anti- P04275 ( P04275 ) aptamer DB05202 for 3 weeks . RESULTS : Plasma concentrations of approximately 10 microg/mL DB05202 decreased P04275 activity by more than 96 % . Plasma exchange treatment acutely decreased the plasma concentrations of DB05202 by a mean of 47 % ( range , 40 % -61 % ) . Thus , additional minibolus infusions of DB05202 were given after each plasma exchange to rapidly restore steady-state concentrations . DB05202 resulted in an increase of Q02083 counts as long as DB05202 was given . On three occasions the infusion was stopped , each accompanied by a decrease in Q02083 counts and worsening of microangiopathy . No serious adverse effects were observed during the treatment with DB05202 . CONCLUSION : DB05202 caused a clear and reproducible increase in Q02083 counts in an otherwise refractory TTP case . These clinical , pharmacokinetic , and pharmacodynamic data provide a rational basis for clinical trials with DB05202 in TTP .
