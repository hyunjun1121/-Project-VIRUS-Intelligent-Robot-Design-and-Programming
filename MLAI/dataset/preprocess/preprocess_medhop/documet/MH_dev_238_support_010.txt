Expression of human all-trans-retinoic acid receptor beta and its ligand-binding domain in Escherichia coli . DB00755 , one of the hormonally active derivatives of vitamin A , occurs physiologically in plasma at a concentration below 10 nmol/l . The methods currently used for its quantification are based on HPLC , need about 1 ml of serum , are relatively laborious and thus not well suited for mass analysis . The affinity and specificity of retinoic acid receptors for all-trans-retinoic acid encouraged us to express both the entire human retinoic acid receptor beta ( P10826 ) and two versions of its retinoic acid-binding domain in Escherichia coli in the hope that these recombinant proteins might be used as binders in a ligand-binding assay for all-trans-retinoic acid . The recombinant receptors , the whole receptor [ P10826 -( Q93033 -Q448) ] , corresponding to domains A-F , and the ligand-binding domain [ P10826 -(E149-Q448) ] , corresponding to domains D-F , were expressed in the vector pET 3d/BL21 ( DE3 ) as inclusion bodies , solubilized with guanidinium chloride , renatured and purified by ion-exchange chromatography . P10826 -(P193-Q448) , corresponding to domains E-F , was expressed in the vector pET 3d/BL21(DE3)pLysS , and purified by reversed-phase chromatography . Under non-denaturing conditions , the expressed whole receptor [ P10826 -( Q93033 -Q448) ] and the D-F construct ( P10826 -(E149-Q448) ] behaved chromatographically as monomeric proteins whereas the E-F construct [ P10826 -(P193-Q448) ] had a strong tendency to aggregate . P10826 -( Q93033 -Q448) and P10826 -(E149-Q448) had similar Kd values for all-trans-retinoic acid ( 1.4 and 0.6 nmol/l respectively ) whereas P10826 -(P193-Q448) bound all-trans-retinoic acid less avidly ( Kd 9.6 nmol/l ) . DB00523 bound to P10826 -(E149-Q448) and P10826 -( Q93033 -Q448) as avidly as all-trans-retinoic acid . Competition experiments showed weak or no binding of 4-oxo-all-trans-retinoic acid , 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid , 13-cis-retinoic acid , acitretin and retinol by P10826 -(E149-Q448) .
