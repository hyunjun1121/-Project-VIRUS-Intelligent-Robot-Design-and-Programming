Cardiac channelopathies associated with infantile fatal ventricular arrhythmias : from the cradle to the bench . BACKGROUND : Fatal ventricular arrhythmias in the early period of life have been associated with cardiac channelopathies for decades , and postmortem analyses in P22304 victims have provided evidence of this association . However , the prevalence and functional properties of cardiac ion channel mutations in infantile fatal arrhythmia cases are not clear . METHODS AND RESULTS : Seven infants with potentially lethal arrhythmias at age < 1 year ( 5 males , age of onset 44.1 Â± 72.1 days ) were genetically analyzed for P51787 , Q12809 , P15382 -5 , P63252 , Q14524 , P36382 , and P62158 by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing . Whole-cell currents of wildtype and mutant channels were recorded and analyzed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with Q14524 and Q12809 cDNA . In 5 of 7 patients , we identified 4 mutations ( p.N1774D , p.T290fsX53 , p.F1486del and p.N406K ) in Q14524 , and 1 mutation ( p.G628D ) in Q12809 . N1774D , F1486del , and N406K in Q14524 displayed tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent late Na(+) currents . By contrast , Q14524 -T290fsX53 was nonfunctional . Q12809 -G628D exhibited loss of channel function . CONCLUSION : Genetic screening of 7 patients was used to demonstrate the high prevalence of cardiac channelopathies . Functional assays revealed both gain and loss of channel function in Q14524 mutations , as well as loss of function associated with the Q12809 mutation .
