DB01427 and theophylline differentially regulate cytokine and nitric oxide production in endotoxemic mice . Intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels play an important role in the regulation of several immunological processes . Since elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration by inhibition of phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) is known to modulate the inflammatory response , we compared the effect of amrinone , an inhibitor of the PDE III isoenzyme , and of theophylline , a nonspecific PDE inhibitor , on the plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) , and nitric oxide response in mice to intraperitoneal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Intraperitoneal treatment of animals with amrinone ( 100 mg/kg ) 30 min before LPS administration decreased both plasma P05231 and P22301 concentrations in the first phase of the response , but enhanced plasma levels of these cytokines in the second part . In contrast , pretreatment of the animals with theophylline ( 100 mg/kg ) enhanced LPS-induced plasma P05231 and P22301 levels during the whole response . However , pretreatment with both PDE inhibitors resulted in a marked inhibition of LPS-evoked plasma concentrations of P01375 and nitrite/nitrate ( breakdown products of nitric oxide ) throughout the response . This study demonstrates for the first time that amrinone and theophylline possess differential , but primarily anti-inflammatory , properties during LPS-induced systemic inflammation in the mouse .
