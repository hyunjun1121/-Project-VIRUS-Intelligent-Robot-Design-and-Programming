The human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene is a primary target of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its nuclear receptor . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) delta is the most widely expressed member of the Q07869 family of nuclear receptor fatty acid sensors . Real-time PCR analysis of breast and prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that PPARdelta expression was increased 1.5 to 3.2-fold after three hours stimulation with the natural vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) agonist , 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) . In silico analysis of the 20 kb of the human PPARdelta promoter revealed a Q93038 -type DB00136 response element approximately 350 bp upstream of the transcription start site , which was able to bind P11473 -retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) heterodimers and mediate a DB00136 -dependent upregulation of reporter gene activity . Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that a number of proteins representative for DB00136 -mediated gene activation , such as P11473 , RXR and RNA polymerase II , displayed a DB00136 -dependent association with a region of the proximal PPARdelta promoter that contained the putative Q93038 -type VDRE . This was also true for other proteins that are involved in or are the subject of chromatin modification , such as the histone acetyltransferase CBP and histone 4 , which displayed ligand-dependent association and acetylation , respectively . Finally , real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that DB00136 and the synthetic PPARdelta ligand L783483 show a cell and time-dependent interference in each other 's effects on P11473 mRNA expression , so that their combined application shows complex effects on the induction of P11473 target genes , such as Q07973 . Taken together , we conclude that PPARdelta is a primary DB00136 -responding gene and that P11473 and PPARdelta signaling pathways are interconnected at the level of cross-regulation of their respective transcription factor mRNA levels .
