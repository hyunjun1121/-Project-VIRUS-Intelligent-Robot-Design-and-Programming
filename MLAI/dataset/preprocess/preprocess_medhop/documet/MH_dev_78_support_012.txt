Effects of combined octreotide and aspirin on the growth of gastric cancer . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effects of the combination of octreotide and aspirin on the growth of gastric cancer . METHODS : Proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines treated with octreotide or aspirin was determined by (3)H-thymidine incorporation . After xenografts of human gastric cancer were implanted orthotopically in the stomach of nude mice , they were administered octreotide plus aspirin for 8 weeks . The mRNA of somatostatin receptor in the tissues of gastric carcinoma was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . P35354 in gastric cancer tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : Both octreotide and aspirin significantly reduced the (3)H-thymidine incorporation of gastric cancer cells . Xenografts in situ were found in all stomachs of nude mice except for two in the combination group . Either size or weight of tumors treated by octreotide , aspirin or in combination was significantly reduced as compared with that of controls . The inhibition rate for tumor was 60.6 % ( octreotide ) , 39.3 % ( aspirin ) , and 85.6 % ( in combination ) respectively . No severe side effects were observed in any treated groups . Somatostatin receptor-2 and -3 were expressed in the transplanted gastric adenocarcinomas . DB00945 could down-regulate the strong expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in the tissue of gastric adenocarcinomas of nude mice . CONCLUSION : A combination of octreotide and aspirin significantly inhibited proliferation of gastric cancer through mediation of somatostatin receptors and suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 .
