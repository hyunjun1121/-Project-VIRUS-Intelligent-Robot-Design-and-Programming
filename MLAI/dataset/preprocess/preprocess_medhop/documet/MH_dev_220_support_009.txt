Polymorphisms associated with egg number at 300 days of age in chickens . We looked for variations that could be associated with chicken egg number at 300 days of age ( EN300 ) in seven genes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis , including gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-I ( DB00644 ) , P30968 ( GnRHR ) , neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) , vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( P01282 ) , P01282 receptor-1 ( VIPR-1 ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , and the QTL region between 87 and 105 cM of the Z chromosome . Ten mutations in the seven genes were chosen to do marker-trait association analyses in a population comprising 1310 chickens , which were obtained from a company located in Guangdong Province of China . The C1704887T of VIPR-1 was found to have a highly significant association with EN300 . The T5841629C of P14416 and the C1715301T of VIPR-1 were significantly associated with EN300 . A highly significant association was also found between the C1704887T-C1715301T haplotypes of VIPR-1 and EN300 . H1H3 had the highest EN300 . Four PCR-RFLP variations in the candidate QTL region were selected to investigate their genetic effects on EN300 . The haplotypes of T32742468C-G32742603A in this region showed a highly significant association with EN300 . Bioinformatics analyses showed that both T32742468C and G32742603A were located in intron 1 of the SH3-domain P62993 -like 2 ( Q99962 ) gene . We conclude that five SNPs , including C1704887T and C1715301T of VIPR-1 , T5841629C of P14416 , and T32742468C and G32742603A of Q99962 , would be useful as markers for breeding to increase chicken EN300 .
