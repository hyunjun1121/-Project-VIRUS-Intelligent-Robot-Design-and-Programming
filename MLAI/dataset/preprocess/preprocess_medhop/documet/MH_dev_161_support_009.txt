Effect of targeting janus kinase 3 on the development of intestinal tumors in the adenomatous polyposis coli(min) mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis . Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is associated with germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene , adenomatous polyposis coli ( P25054 ) located on chromosome 5q21 . Multiple intestinal neoplasia ( Min ) in mice resembles FAP in humans , resulting from a single point mutation in the murine homolog of the P25054 gene . The effects of the rationally-designed P52333 ( P52333 ) inhibitor JANEX-1 ( 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) amino-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazoline , WHI-P131 , CAS 202475-60-3 ) on the development of intestinal tumors in the P25054 ( min/+ ) mouse model of FAP were examined . The Min mice were fed with rodent chow or chow supplemented with JANEX-1 once a week starting at 1.5 months of age . The cumulative proportions of mice remaining alive at 7 months were 13 +/- 6 % for control mice versus 72 +/-12 % for JANEX-1 treated mice ( P < 0.0002 ) . In contrast , Compound DDE24 , a synthetically activated genistein , an inhibitor of Epidermal Growth Factor receptor ( P01133 -R ) , cellular homologue of oncogene product from Raus Avian sarcoma virus ( P12931 ) and Syk tyrosine kinases , which Thus , selective targeting of P52333 was highly effective in preventing development of intestinal tumors in Min mice resulting in markedly improved survival outcomes . P52333 inhibitors may therefore be useful in the prevention of colorectal cancer in individuals with FAP .
