Clinical impact of Q9Y6K1 mutations in younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia : results of the AML Study Group ( AMLSG ) . In this study , we evaluated the frequency and prognostic impact of Q9Y6K1 mutations ( Q9Y6K1 (mut) ) in 1770 younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) in the context of other genetic alterations and the European LeukemiaNet ( P15502 ) classification . Q9Y6K1 (mut) were found in 20.9 % of AMLs and were associated with older age ( P < .0001 ) , higher white blood cell counts ( P < .0001 ) , cytogenetically normal AML ( CN-AML ; P < .0001 ) , P06748 mutations ( P < .0001 ) , P36888 internal tandem duplications ( P < .0001 ) , and O75874 /2 mutations ( P < .0001 ) . In univariable and multivariable analyses , Q9Y6K1 (mut) did not impact event-free , relapse-free ( RFS ) , or overall survival ( OS ) in either the entire cohort or in CN-AML ; a negative prognostic effect was found only in the P15502 unfavorable CN-AML subset ( OS , P = .011 ) . In addition , R882 mutations vs non-R882 mutations showed opposite clinical effects-unfavorable for R882 on RFS ( all : hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.29 [ P = .026 ] ; CN-AML : HR , 1.38 [ P = .018 ] ) and favorable for non-R882 on OS ( all : HR , 0.77 [ P = .057 ] ; CN-AML : HR , 0.73 [ P = .083 ] ) . In our statistically high-powered study with minimized selection bias , Q9Y6K1 (mut) represent a frequent genetic lesion in younger adults with AML but have no significant impact on survival end points ; only moderate effects on outcome were found , depending on molecular subgroup and Q9Y6K1 (mut) type .
