DB01686 and oxidative stress . Elevated plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) represent a novel risk factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction and a predictor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality . However , it is unknown whether elevated DB01686 plasma concentrations may be considered simply as a marker for cardiovascular disease or whether increased DB01686 levels per se may predispose to the development of vascular disease . There is experimental and clinical evidence linking endothelial dysfunction to increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals such as superoxide anion . Oxidative stress has been shown to increase the activity of arginine methylating and DB01686 degrading enzymes leading to increased DB01686 concentrations . Interestingly , the endothelial nitric oxide synthase may become uncoupled in the presence of high DB01686 levels further contributing to the vascular oxidative stress burden . It remains to be established to what extent DB01686 is able to interact with P29474 in vivo . Possible mechanisms underlying increased oxidative stress in the setting of elevated DB01686 concentrations and therapeutic implications will be discussed .
