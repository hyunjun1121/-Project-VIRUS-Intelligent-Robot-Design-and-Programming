DB05039 inhibits tumor cell invasiveness and P14780 expression by suppressing IKK/NF-κB activation . The β2 adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor expressed in the human respiratory tract and widely recognized as a pharmacological target for treatments of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( P48444 ) . Although a number of P07550 agonists have been developed for use in asthma therapy , indacaterol is the only ultra-long-acting inhaled β2-agonist ( LABA ) approved by the FDA for relieving the symptoms in P48444 patients . The precise molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effect of indacaterol , however , remains unclear . Here , we show that β-arrestin-2 mediates the internalization of P07550 following indacaterol treatment . Moreover , we demonstrate that indacaterol significantly inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) -induced NF-κB activity by reducing levels of both phosphorylated-IKK and -IκBα , thereby decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation and the expression of P14780 , an NF-κB target gene . Subsequently , we show that indacaterol significantly inhibits P01375 -α/NF-κB-induced cell invasiveness and migration in a human cancer cell line . In conclusion , we propose that indacaterol may inhibit NF-κB activity in a β-arrestin2-dependent manner , preventing further lung damage and improving lung function in P48444 patients .
