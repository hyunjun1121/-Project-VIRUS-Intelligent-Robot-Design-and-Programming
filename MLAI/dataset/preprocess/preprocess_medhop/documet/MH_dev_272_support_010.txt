DB00583 -palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency : novel mutations and relevance of newborn screening . We report on a newborn male , born at term after an uneventful pregnancy presenting with a pathological acylcarnitine profile in routine newborn screening on the third day of life . The profile showed characteristic elevations of C14:0- , C16:0- , C16:1- and C18:1-acylcarnitines , while the ratio of ( C16 + C18:1 ) / P06681 was increased , suggesting P23786 - or carnitine-acylcarnitine-translocase- deficiency . The acylcarnitine profile in blood taken on day 9 was normal with breast milk feeding . No dicarboxylic aciduria was found . In fibroblasts , the activity of P23786 was decreased to 25 % , overall oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids was reduced to 10 % of control values . Sequence analysis of the P23786 gene showed heterozygosity for two previously undescribed mutations in exon 4 : c.748-749delAA ( truncating ) , and c.1436A > G ( p.Tyr479Cys ; missense ) mutations . The asymptomatic parents were found to be heterozygous , the mother carries the c.748-749delAA and the father the c.1436A > G mutation . The boy is now 2.5 years old ; no clinical symptoms associated with the marked impairment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation have occurred . Confirmation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation defects from an initial abnormal newborn-screening by tandem mass spectrometry should include enzyme and , if possible , molecular genetic analysis despite a normal 2nd screening . Biochemical testing of urine ( organic acids ) may be unrevealing .
