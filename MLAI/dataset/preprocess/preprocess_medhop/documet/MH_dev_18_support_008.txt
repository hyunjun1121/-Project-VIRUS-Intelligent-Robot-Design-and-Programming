Blocking cannabinoid P21554 receptors for the treatment of nicotine dependence : insights from pre-clinical and clinical studies . Tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death in developed countries . Since existing medications are only partially effective in treating tobacco smokers , there is a great need for improved medications for smoking cessation . It has been recently proposed that cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonists represent a new class of therapeutic agents for drug dependence , and notably , nicotine dependence . Here , we will review current evidence supporting the use of this class of drugs for smoking cessation treatment . Pre-clinical studies indicate that nicotine exposure produces changes in endocannabinoid content in the brain . In experimental animals , N-piperidinyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)- DB01213 -3-carboxamide ( rimonabant , SR141716 ) and N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide ( AM251 ) , two cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonists , block nicotine self-administration behavior , an effect that may be related to the blockade of the dopamine-releasing effects of nicotine in the brain . DB06155 also seems efficacious in decreasing the influence of nicotine-associated stimuli over behavior , suggesting that it may act on two distinct neuronal pathways , those implicated in drug-taking behavior and those involved in relapse phenomena . The utility of rimonabant has been evaluated in several clinical trials . It seems that rimonabant is an efficacious treatment for smoking cessation , although its efficacy does not exceed that of nicotine-replacement therapy and its use may be limited by emotional side effects ( nausea , anxiety and depression , mostly ) . DB06155 also appears to decrease relapse rates in smokers . These findings indicate significant , but limited , utility of rimonabant for smoking cessation .
