DB00398 does not improve efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer : A GISCAD randomized phase II study . BACKGROUND : The RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway is commonly activated in pancreatic cancer because of a high frequency of P01116 - P15056 mutations . A phase II randomized trial was designed to investigate the activity of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer . METHODS : Locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive cisplatin plus gemcitabine with sorafenib 400mg bid ( arm A ) or without sorafenib ( arm B ) . RESULTS : One hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled ; of these , 43 ( 74.6 % ) patients progressed in arm A and 44 ( 82.4 % ) in arm B . Median progression-free survival was 4.3 months ( 95 % CI : 2.7-6.5 ) and 4.5 months ( 95 % CI : 2.5-5.2 ) , respectively ( HR=0.92 ; 95 % CI : 0.62-1.35 ) . Median overall survival was 7.5 ( 95 % CI : 5.6-9.7 ) and 8.3 months ( 95 % CI : 6.2-8.7 ) , respectively ( HR=0.95 ; 95 % CI : 0.62-1.48 ) . Response rates were 3.4 % in arm A and 3.6 % in arm B . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 does not significantly enhance activity of chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer patients , and therefore should not be assessed in phase III trials .
