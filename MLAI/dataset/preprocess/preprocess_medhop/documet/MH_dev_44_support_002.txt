Mutations of the Wilms tumor 1 gene ( P19544 ) in older patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia : a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study . We previously reported the adverse prognostic impact of Wilms tumor 1 gene ( P19544 ) mutations in younger adult cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia ( CN-AML ) . Here , we investigated 243 older ( > or = 60 years ) primary CN-AML patients . P19544 mutated ( WT1mut ) patients ( 7 % ) had P36888 -ITD more frequently ( P < .001 ) , lower hemoglobin ( P = .01 ) , higher white blood cell count ( P = .03 ) and percentage blood blasts ( P = .03 ) , and a shorter overall survival ( P = .08 ) than P19544 wild-type ( WT1wt ) patients . Comparing older and younger WT1mut patients , they had similar pretreatment characteristics and outcome . By contrast , among WT1wt CN-AML , younger patients had a significantly better outcome . A P19544 mutation-associated gene-expression signature , reported here for the first time , included P40200 , a leukemia stem cell-specific marker , and genes involved in gene regulation ( eg , Q03164 , P29590 , and P63162 ) and in proliferative and metabolic processes ( eg , P06213 , Q9Y4H2 , and Q13131 ) , supporting the role of mutated P19544 in deregulating multiple homeostatic processes . Our results indicate that WT1mut CN-AML represents a distinct entity with poor treatment response across age groups . This study has been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00900224 .
