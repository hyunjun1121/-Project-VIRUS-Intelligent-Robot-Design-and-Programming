Cytokine-induced beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase in human endothelial cells mediates alpha 2,6-sialylation of adhesion molecules and P20273 ligands . Sialic acids decorating blood and cell surface proteins can play important roles in various biological processes . The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and interleukin-1 , as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide , can activate vascular endothelium , increasing expression of several surface glycoproteins . Here we show that treatment of cultured human endothelial cells ( O14777 ) with P01375 , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide causes increased expression of the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialytransferase ( alpha 2-6STN ) . P01375 was most effective , inducing a 3.5-fold enhancement of cell-associated sialytransferase activity by 72 h . In addition , activated O14777 secreted a large portion of the induced sialyltransferase activity into the medium . Analysis of labeled O14777 showed both a relative and an absolute increase of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid on N-linked oligosaccharides after P01375 stimulation . This coincided with increased expression of endothelial glycoproteins bearing N-linked glycans with alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid detected by the lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin . The cytokine-inducible endothelial cell adhesion molecules P16581 , P05362 , and P19320 are among these glycoprotein substrates for alpha 2-6STN . These changes also correlated with a substantial increase in binding sites for P20273 beta , a mammalian lectin known to recognize oligosaccharides carrying multiple copies of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid . Northern analysis revealed increased levels of mRNA encoding alpha 2-6STN . Thus , activation of endothelial cells during inflammatory and immunological processes may induce alpha 2-6STN , which can participate in sialylation of other activation-dependent molecules .
