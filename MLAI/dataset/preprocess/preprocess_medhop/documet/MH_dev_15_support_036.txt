Role of O60674 - P40763 in O60603 -mediated tissue factor expression . P13726 ( TF ) is a core protein with an essential function in the coagulation cascade that maintains the homeostasis of the blood vessels . TF not only participates in neointima formation , but also causes the development of atherosclerosis . This study investigated the mechanism regulating TF expression in macrophages using Pam3 CSK4 , a O60603 ligand . Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression in two types of macrophages ( Raw264.7 and BMDM ) , but not in O60603 KO mice derived BMDM . Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression was inhibited by pretreatment with pan-JAK inhibitor or O60674 inhibitor AG490 . O60674 knock-down by siRNA inhibited Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . Pam3 CSK4 stimulated P40763 phosphorylation ( S727 ) , while P40763 knock-down by siRNA reduced Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . These results suggest that Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression is regulated by the O60674 - P40763 signaling pathway . Pam3 CSK4 , unlike increased TF expression , significantly decreased P41220 expression , while P41220 overexpression decreased Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression . Inhibition of TF by P41220 WT did not occur in mutants with flawed Q99697 domains . We also investigated the correlation between P41220 and P40763 phosphorylation . P41220 knock-down elevated Pam3 CSK4 induced P40763 phosphorylation , but P41220 overexpression had the opposite effect on P40763 phosphorylation . These results suggest that , while Pam3 CSK4 induced TF expression is regulated by O60674 - P40763 signaling , P41220 is a negative regulator targeted to P40763 .
