P10275 gene polymorphisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) is more common in men than in women ( male to female ratio of approximately 2:1 ) , suggesting a role for a sex-linked factor in the disease . The recent identification of a mutation of the androgen receptor gene in Kennedy 's disease or X-linked bulbospinal neuronopathy , a rare form of progressive lower motor neurone degeneration , also associated with clinical signs of androgen insensitivity , raises the possibility that androgen function may be disturbed in other motor neurone disorders , including P35858 . The Kennedy 's disease mutation consists of an increased size of a highly polymorphic CAG repeat sequence in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene , coding for a polyglutamine tract . We have analysed this CAG repeat sequence in a large number of patients with typical sporadic P35858 and in normal controls , in order to test the hypothesis that this polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene may influence susceptibility for P35858 . We report that the distribution of alleles relating to the size of the CAG repeat sequence of the androgen receptor gene is similar in P35858 and controls , indicating that polymorphisms of the CAG repeat sequence of the androgen receptor gene play a limited role , if any , in susceptibility to P35858 .
