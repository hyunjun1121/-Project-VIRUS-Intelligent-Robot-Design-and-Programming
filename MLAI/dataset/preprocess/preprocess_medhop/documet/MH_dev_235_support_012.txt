Establishment of a cell-based drug screening model for identifying agonists of human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) . OBJECTIVES : P37231 ( PPARγ ) plays a critical role in regulation of diverse biological processes , including lipid metabolism and adipogenesis , cell division and apoptosis , and is involved in variety of disease conditions , such as obesity , atherosclerosis , inflammation and tumour . Developing a cell-based reporter gene model targeting PPARγ would be useful to screen human PPARγ agonists that could be beneficial to patients with these diseases . METHODS : We stably co-transfected human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) cell line 293T cells with phPPARγ-IRES2-EGFP vector to express human PPARγ ( hPPARγ ) , a reporter vector pPPRE×3-TK-LUC , and control vector pRL-CMV . The efficiency of the co-transfection was evaluated with flow cytometry of hPPARγ expressing cells . Specificity of hPPARγ activity was determined by dual luciferase reporter assay of co-transfected cells exposed to PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone , PPARα agonist WY14643 and retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARα ) agonist all-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) . KEY FINDINGS : The phPPARγ-IRES2-EGFP co-transfected HEK293T cells showed concentration- and time-dependent luciferase induction upon exposure to the rosiglitazone , while WY14643 and DB00755 were unable to activate the co-transfected HEK293T cells . CONCLUSIONS : These data indicated that the HEK293T cells could be stably transfected with hPPARγ . This cell-based drug screening platform could be used targeting specific nuclear receptor of hPPARγ with effectiveness and specificity for hPPARγ agonists discovery .
