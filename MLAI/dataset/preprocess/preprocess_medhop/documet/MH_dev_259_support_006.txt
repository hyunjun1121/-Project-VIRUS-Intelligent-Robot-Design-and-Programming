Immunoglobulin treatment reduces atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-/- low-density lipoprotein receptor-/- mice via the complement system . Atherosclerosis is associated with activation of the immune system . Intravenously applied normal polyclonal immunoglobulins ( DB00028 ) have broad therapeutic applications in the treatment of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases . Recently , DB00028 have been shown to inhibit atherogenesis in experimental animal models . To investigate the role of the complement system in this process , we used third complement component-deficient ( P01024 (-/-) ) and control atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) and low-density lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) double knock-out mice fed a normal diet . DB00028 treatment reduced lesion fraction area in the aortic root of complement-sufficient mice whereas the lesion fraction area of P01024 (-/-) mice was not affected . Thus , complement activation plays a role in the anti-atherosclerotic effects of DB00028 , possibly by P01024 -derived fragments generated through Fc-dependent complement activation .
