The thienopyridine derivatives ( platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists ) , pharmacology and clinical developments . The thienopyridines , ticlopidine and clopidogrel , are antiplatelet drugs . They are prodrugs and are metabolised in the liver to active metabolites that are non-competitive antagonists of the platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor , Q9H244 . Inhibition of platelet aggregation by these drugs is delayed until 24-48 h after administration , with maximal inhibition achieved after 3-5 days . Recovery of platelet function after drug withdrawal is slow ( 7-14 days ) . DB00208 and clopidogrel are effective in preventing atherothrombotic events in cardiovascular , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease . Gastrointestinal side effects and skin rashes are common . However , neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are significant and sometimes fatal adverse effects of ticlopidine . DB00758 appears to offer several advantages over ticlopidine : a more rapid onset of action and a lower incidence of neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.A combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has become standard for antithrombotic therapy in cardiovascular disease . The anaesthetic considerations of patients taking the thienopyridine compounds are discussed .
