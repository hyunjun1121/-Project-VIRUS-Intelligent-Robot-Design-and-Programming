The cannabinoid P21554 antagonists SR 141716A and AM 251 suppress food intake and food-reinforced behavior in a variety of tasks in rats . Cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonists , including DB00470 ( Delta 9-THC ) ( the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana ) have been shown to increase feeding in rats and humans . Conversely , it has been reported that acute administration of the P21554 receptor antagonist SR 141716A reduces food intake in rats . Based upon this observation , it has been suggested that P21554 antagonists could be useful as appetite suppressant drugs . The present studies were designed to provide a detailed examination of the effects of P21554 antagonists on food intake across a range of paradigms . Two P21554 antagonists ( SR 141716A and AM 251 ) were administered to rats trained on fixed-ratio schedules with two different ratio requirements ( fixed-ratio 1 and fixed-ratio 5 ) . Both drugs produced a dose-dependent decrease in lever pressing , and had a relatively long duration of action ( T1/2 : SR 141716A , 15.1 h ; AM 251 , 22.0 h ) . Furthermore , intake of three diets with differing macronutrient composition ( lab chow , high fat , high carbohydrate ) was studied . Both drugs significantly suppressed intake of all three foods , and there were no significant interactions between drug dose and diet type . These findings support the hypothesis that P21554 receptor antagonists could be useful pharmacological tools for the suppression of appetite .
