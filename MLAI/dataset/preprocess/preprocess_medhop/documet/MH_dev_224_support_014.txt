Spray drying tenofovir loaded mucoadhesive and pH-sensitive microspheres intended for HIV prevention . PURPOSE : To develop spray dried mucoadhesive and pH-sensitive microspheres ( MS ) based on polymethacrylate salt intended for vaginal delivery of tenofovir ( a model HIV microbicide ) and assess their critical biological responses . METHODS : The formulation variables and process parameters are screened and optimized using a 2(4-1) fractional factorial design . The MS are characterized for size , zeta potential , yield , encapsulation efficiency , Carr 's index , drug loading , in vitro release , cytotoxicity , inflammatory responses and mucoadhesion . RESULTS : The optimal MS formulation has an average size of 4.73μm , zeta potential of -26.3mV , 68.9 % yield , encapsulation efficiency of 88.7 % , Carr 's index of 28.3 and drug loading of 2 % ( w/w ) . The MS formulation release 91.7 % of its payload in the presence of simulated human semen . At a concentration of 1mg/ml , the MS are noncytotoxic to vaginal endocervical/epithelial cells and Lactobacillus crispatus when compared to control media . There is also no statistically significant level of inflammatory cytokine ( IL1-α , IL-1β , P05231 , P10145 , and P02778 ) release triggered by these MS . Their percent mucoadhesion is 2-fold higher than that of 1 % O14777 gel formulation . CONCLUSION : These data suggest the promise of using such MS as an alternative controlled microbicide delivery template by intravaginal route for HIV prevention .
