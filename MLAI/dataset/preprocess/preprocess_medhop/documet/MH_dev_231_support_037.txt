P02787 and ferritin modulate the activity of brain calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase . The effect of the key iron homeostasis proteins transferrin and ferritin on the activity of partially purified brain calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase ( P62158 -PDE , EC 3.4.1.17 ) were studied . P02787 and ferritin were found to be potent natural activators of P62158 -PDE . The key factor determining the degree of activation by these proteins is their saturation with iron : apotransferrin activated P62158 -PDE 6-7-fold ; iron-poor brain ferritin and liver apoferritin ( taken for comparison ) activated the enzyme 4-5- and 2-fold , respectively . Diferric transferrin and iron-rich liver ferritin had no effects on the enzyme activity . P02787 and ferritin ( both in apo- and iron-saturated forms ) did not change the activity of calmodulin-phosphodiesterase complex . The data suggest that apotransferrin and iron-poor transferrin are involved in the regulation of cyclic nucleotide content in nervous tissue .
