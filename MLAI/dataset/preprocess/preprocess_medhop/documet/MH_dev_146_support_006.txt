DB08875 ( DB05153 ) , a novel MET and P35968 inhibitor , simultaneously suppresses metastasis , angiogenesis , and tumor growth . The signaling pathway of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) is important for cell growth , survival , and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of P15692 , which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression . Dysregulation of the MET/ P15692 axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis . DB08875 ( DB05153 ) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) , as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology , including P07949 , P10721 , P30530 , and P36888 . Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and P35968 phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro . In mouse models , cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology , resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast , lung , and glioma tumor models . Importantly , treatment with cabozantinib did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis , which has been observed with inhibitors of P15692 signaling that do not target MET . Collectively , these data suggest that cabozantinib is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated MET and VEGFR signaling .
