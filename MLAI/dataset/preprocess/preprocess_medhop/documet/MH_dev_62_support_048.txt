DB08904 : an evidence-based review of its place in the treatment of Crohn 's disease . INTRODUCTION : Crohn 's disease ( CD ) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by a relapsing/remitting course with transmural inflammation of potentially any section of the digestive tract . DB08904 ( CZP ) is a pegylated Fc-free Fab ' fragment of a humanized anti- P01375 -alfa monoclonal antibody that is in development for clinical use in CD . AIMS : To review the available data with CZP in CD , to investigate its possible place in therapy . EVIDENCE REVIEW : Available studies suggest that CZP has the potential to achieve and maintain clinical response and remission in moderate to severe CD , and to improve quality of life compared with placebo . Further studies with CZP are also ongoing . PLACE IN THERAPY : Although only suggested by currently available studies , successive clinical practice and further ongoing trials may confirm a positive role for CZP as a new anti- P01375 treatment in CD . The impact on clinical management or on resources can not be estimated until the results from all phase III clinical trials are available and the price is determined .
