5-hydroxytryptamine and its receptors in systemic vascular walls . 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) in the bloodstream is largely contained in platelets and circulates throughout the entire vascular system . 5-HT released from activated platelets dramatically changes the function of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) and endothelial cells ( ECs ) . In VSMCs , 5-HT induces proliferation and migration via 5- Q13049 receptors . These effects are further enhanced by vasoactive substances such as thromboxane A2 and angiotensin II . 5- Q13049 receptor activation in VSMCs also causes both enhancement of prostaglandin I2 production by inducing cyclooxygenase-2 and reduction of nitric oxide ( NO ) by suppressing inducible NO synthase . Evidence showing that 5-HT in ECs plays a principal role in angiogenesis now exists . Stimulation of 5-HT1 and/or 5-HT2 receptors has been implicated in the angiogenic effect of 5-HT . The extracellular signal-regulated kinase and endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) activation-dependent pathways are involved in the mechanisms . Moreover , Q13639 receptors in ECs have been shown to also regulate angiogenesis . Recent reports show sarpogrelate , a selective antagonist of the 5- Q13049 receptor , indirectly enhances the function of P28222 receptors in ECs via inhibition of 5- Q13049 receptors in VSMCs or platelets . This indirect action of P28222 receptors in ECs may increase NO production derived from P29474 and a vasodilator response . Furthermore , sarpogrelate and other 5- Q13049 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce the constitutive activity of 5- Q13049 receptors . It is believed that increasing evidence on the role of 5-HT receptors will contribute to the expansion of the clinical application of existing therapeutic drugs such as sarpogrelate , and to the development of new 5-HT receptor-related drugs for treating cardiovascular diseases .
