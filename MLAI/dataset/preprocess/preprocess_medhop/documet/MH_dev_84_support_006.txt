Vascular changes after cardiac surgery : role of NOS , P36551 , kinases , and growth factors . Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world . Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and catheter based interventions , coronary artery bypass grafting remains an essential therapeutic modality . The majority of coronary artery bypass operations , as well as other cardiac surgical procedures require the use of ischemic cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass , both of which result in iatrogenic injury to the vasculature and microcirculation . This injury can manifest as impaired vasorelaxation or vasoconstriction , depending upon the organ system involved , resulting in impaired tissue perfusion and the development of edema . Key to this dysfunction are changes in the following : nitric oxide signaling secondary to changes in P29474 and P35228 expression and activity , cyclooxygenase function with increases in pro-inflammatory P35354 activity , alterations in Protein Kinase C and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase signaling , and an increase in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor expression increasing vascular permeability and dilatation . This review discusses our current understanding of cardioplegia and cardiopulmonary bypass induced changes in the vasculature , and therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the altered signaling pathways .
