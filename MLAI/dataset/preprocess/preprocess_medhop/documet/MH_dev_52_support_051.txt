Leukotriene binding , signaling , and analysis of HIV coreceptor function in mouse and human leukotriene B4 receptor-transfected cells . The mouse leukotriene B4 receptor ( m- Q15722 ) gene was cloned . Membrane fractions of human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing m- Q15722 demonstrated a high affinity and specific binding for leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 , Kd = 0.24 +/- 0.03 nM ) . In competition binding experiments , LTB4 was the most potent competitor ( Ki = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM ) followed by 20-hydroxy-LTB4 ( Ki = 1.1 +/- 0.2 nM ) and by 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 and LTD4 ( Ki > 1 microM ) . In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells , LTB4 inhibited forskolin-activated DB02527 production and induced an increase of intracellular calcium , suggesting that this receptor is coupled to Gi- and Go-like proteins . In Xenopus laevis melanophores transiently expressing m- Q15722 , LTB4 induced the aggregation of pigment granules , confirming the inhibition of DB02527 production induced by LTB4 . Q15722 receptors share significant sequence homology with chemokine receptors ( P51681 and P61073 ) that act as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) coreceptors . However , among the 16 HIV/SIV strains tested , the human Q15722 receptor did not act as a coreceptor for virus entry into P01730 -expressing cells based on infection and cell-cell fusion assays . In P09917 -deficient mice , the absence of leukotriene B4 biosynthesis did not detectably alter m- Q15722 receptor binding in membranes obtained from glycogen-elicited neutrophils . Isolation of the m- Q15722 gene will form the basis of future experiments to elucidate the selective role of LTB4 , as opposed to cysteinyl-leukotrienes , in murine models of inflammation .
