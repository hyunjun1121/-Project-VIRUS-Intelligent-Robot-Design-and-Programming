Activation of T cells via P08174 : recruitment of early components of the CD3-TCR pathway is required for P60568 secretion . It was previously reported that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( P06744 ) -anchored P08174 molecule provides a co-stimulatory signal for T lymphocytes and is constitutively associated with the Src-related kinase p56lck . The present studies were undertaken to clarify the mechanism of action of P08174 in T cells . We describe the failure of cross-linking of P08174 alone to induce both the elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration and the tyrosine phosphorylation of P98160 -gamma in CD3+ Jurkat cells . By contrast , it is sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on p56lck , the TCR-zeta chain as well as Q7Z2W4 -70 . Surprisingly , the observed TCR-zeta and Q7Z2W4 -70 tyrosine phosphorylations appear delayed compared to stimulation via CD3 . DB01373 ionophore A23187 in combination with cross-linked P08174 mAb initially caused an acceleration in the kinetic of these two phosphorylation events , followed by P60568 secretion . Furthermore , transfection of the cytoplasmic domain of TCR-zeta in CD3- Jurkat cells , using a CD16-zeta chimera , demonstrates that P08174 -mediated T-cell activation depends on the expression of this chain of the CD3-TCR complex .
