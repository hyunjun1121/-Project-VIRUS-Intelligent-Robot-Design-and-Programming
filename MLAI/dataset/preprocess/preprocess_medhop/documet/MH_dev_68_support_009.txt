[ Obesity studies in candidate genes ] . There are more than 430 chromosomic regions with gene variants involved in body weight regulation and obesity development . Polymorphisms in genes related to energy expenditure -- uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) , related to adipogenesis and insulin resistance -- hormone-sensitive lipase ( Q96M11 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) , beta adrenergic receptors ( P07550 ,3 ) , and alfa tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) , and related to food intake -- ghrelin ( Q9UBU3 ) -- appear to be associated with obesity phenotypes . Obesity risk depends on two factors : a ) genetic variants in candidate genes , and b ) biographical exposure to environmental risk factors . It is necessary to perform new studies , with appropriate control groups and designs , in order to reach relevant conclusions with regard to gene/environmental ( diet , lifestyle ) interactions .
