P10275 rediscovered : the new biology and targeting the androgen receptor therapeutically . Discoveries over the past decade suggest that castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) is sensitive , but not resistant to , further manipulation of the androgen-androgen receptor ( AR ) axis . Several new therapies that target this axis have demonstrated clinical activity . In this article , preclinical and clinical findings occurring in the field of AR-targeted therapies are reviewed . Reviews of scientific and clinical development are divided into those occurring prereceptor ( androgen production and conversion ) and at the level of the receptor ( AR aberrations and therapies targeting AR directly ) . Intracrine androgen production and AR amplification , among others , are among the principal aberrancies driving CRPC growth . Phase III data with abiraterone acetate and phase II data with DB08899 , along with other similar therapies , confirm for the clinician that the scientific findings related to persistent AR signaling in a castrate milieu can be harnessed to produce significant clinical benefit for patients with the disease . Studies aimed at optimizing the timing of their use and exploring the mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are under way . The clinical success of therapies that directly target androgen synthesis as well as the most common aberrancies of the AR confirm that prostate cancer retains dependence on AR signaling , even in the castrate state .
