[ Production of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells -- correlation with clinicomorphological features in laryngeal carcinoma ] . INTRODUCTION : In studied analyzed role of the cytokines in pathology of neoplasms of various origin the importance of these proteins in regulation of immunocompetent cells function has been described . The aim of this study was to estimate of cho sen cytokines concentration produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in whole blood in patients with laryngeal carcinoma and to analyze the connection of cytokines profile with clinicopathological features . MATERIALA AND METHODS : 55 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated at ENT Department Medical University of Lodz between 2003-2007 were analyzed . For estimation of cytokine secretion the cultures of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( T lymphocytes ) and the whole blood were established . Production of cytokines in supernatants was detected by Elisa . Connections with clinicomorphological features ( pT , pN , Anneroth , Batsakis i Lunas ' classification ) were analyzed . RESULTS : Authors reported statistical correlation between chosen cytokines concentration and clinicomorphological parameters : pT and P60568 , P05231 , P10145 , TNFalpha produced by isolated cells and P60568 , P05231 , TNFa and IFNgamma in whole blood , pN and P10145 , P22301 , IFNgamma ; P00519 score and P05231 , TNFalpha , IFNgamma produced by isolated cells and P60568 , P05231 , P22301 , TNFalpha , IFNgamma in whole blood . CONCLUSION : Our studied indicated the important influence of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines produced by immunocompetent cells for course of neoplasm disease , aggressiveness and advance in laryngeal carcinoma .
