[ P10912 antagonists : potential indications ] . DB00082 is a mutated human growth hormone molecule , which binds to the growth hormone receptor . This binding , however , does not lead to signal transduction . Therefore , in high concentrations pegvisomant acts as a growth hormone receptor antagonist . In a short term study ( 3 months ) pegvisomant was shown to be an effective treatment for acromegaly . On theoretical grounds decreasing the biological effects of growth hormone in patients with diabetes mellitus could have a favourable impact on the severity of the secondary complications associated with this disease . Animal models for diabetic retino- and nephropathy are in accordance with this concept . Human data are lacking but clinical studies investigating the effect of pegvisomant in diabetes mellitus are in preparation . Growth hormone , either directly or via its downstream effector insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) has been implicated as an important factor in the growth of malignant tumours . Animal studies in which human colon and breast cancer models were used showed that pegvisomant can powerfully decrease tumour growth . Studies in cancer patients have not yet started .
