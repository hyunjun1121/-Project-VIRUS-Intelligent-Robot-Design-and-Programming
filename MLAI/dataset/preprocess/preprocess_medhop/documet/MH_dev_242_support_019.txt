DB06403 for pulmonary arterial hypertension . Endothelin receptor antagonists ( ERAs ) are an important class of agents used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . DB06403 is an oral , once-daily , endothelin type-A receptor ( P25101 ) -selective , propanoic acid class ERA under clinical investigation for the treatment of PAH . In a Phase II study , ambrisentan improved 6-minute walk distance , Borg dyspnea index , World Health Organization Functional Class , and hemodynamics . DB06403 was well tolerated and adverse events were not dose related , including a low incidence and severity of liver function test abnormalities . There are no relevant interactions between ambrisentan and cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( metabolism , induction or inhibition ) that might alter the activity of P450-metabolized drugs . Potential benefits of ambrisentan include oral , once-daily dosing , ET(A)-receptor selectivity , and the decreased risks of liver toxicity and adverse drug-drug interactions compared with other ERAs .
