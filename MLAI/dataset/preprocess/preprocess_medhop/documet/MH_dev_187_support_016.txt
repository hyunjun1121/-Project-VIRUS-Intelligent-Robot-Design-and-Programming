Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors : PTK787/ZK 222584 . PTK787/ZK 222584 ( DB04879 ) is an oral potent and selective inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -mediated Flt-1 and P35968 receptor tyrosine kinases . DB04879 has been shown to reduce growth and microvasculature in subcutaneously implanted human tumor xenografts in nude mice . A clinical difficulty in evaluating angiogenesis inhibitors has been the usefulness of conventional study endpoints . Therefore , dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE- Q9BWK5 ) has been studied as a pharmacodynamic marker of efficacy of DB04879 . Phase I studies are under way evaluating the optimum dose and schedule of oral DB04879 administered continuously to patients with advanced cancers of types known to overexpress P15692 . To date , particularly in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with DB04879 , DCE- Q9BWK5 has been a useful predictor of the biological response of P15692 -receptor inhibition . Toxicities have been manageable and have included lightheadedness , ataxia , nausea , vomiting , and hypertension . Stabilization of disease for >/= 6 months has been seen in heavily pretreated patients receiving DB04879 at higher doses . Preliminary data suggest that DB04879 can be administered safely on a continuous daily dosing schedule , efficacy data look promising , and DCE- Q9BWK5 correlates with biological response . DCE- Q9BWK5 will be used to guide dose optimization of DB04879 and perhaps of other angiogenesis inhibitors in future studies .
