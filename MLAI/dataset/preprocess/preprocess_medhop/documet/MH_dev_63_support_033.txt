Hepatic overexpression of Abcb11 in mice promotes the conservation of bile acids within the enterohepatic circulation . The bile salt export pump , encoded by O95342 , is the predominant canalicular transport protein for biliary bile acid secretion . The level of O95342 expression in humans is widely variable yet the impact of this variability on human disease is not well defined . We aim to determine the effect of hepatic Abcb11 overexpression on the enterohepatic circulation ( EHC ) in mice . We used a stable isotope dilution technique in transgenic mice overexpressing hepatic Abcb11 ( P02766 -Abcb11 ) to determine the pool size , fractional turnover rate ( FTR ) , and synthesis rate of the primary bile acid , cholic acid ( CA ) . The gallbladder was cannulated to determine bile flow , bile acid composition , and the biliary secretion rates of CA , total bile acids , phospholipid , and cholesterol . The combined data allowed for estimation of the CA cycling time and the fraction of CA lost per cycle . Hepatic and intestinal gene and protein expression were determined by qPCR and Western blot . Abcb11 overexpression strongly decreased FTR and synthesis rate of CA . Abcb11 overexpression decreased the fraction of CA that was lost per cycle of the EHC . Hepatic expression of Cyp7a1 was suppressed by nearly 50 % and ileal expression of FGF15 was increased more than eightfold in P02766 -Abcb11 mice . Despite the increased intestinal reabsorption of bile acids , ileal Asbt expression was suppressed . Hepatic Abcb11 overexpression in mice increases the conservation of bile acids within the enterohepatic circulation . These data provide strong evidence for the existence of feed-forward communication between hepatic expression of a bile acid transport protein and the intestine .
