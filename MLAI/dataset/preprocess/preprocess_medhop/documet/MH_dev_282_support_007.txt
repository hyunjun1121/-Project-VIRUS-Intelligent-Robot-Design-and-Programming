LPS induces cardiomyocyte injury through calcium-sensing receptor . DB01373 -sensing receptor ( P41180 ) belongs to the family C of G-protein coupled receptors . We have previously demonstrated that P41180 could induce apoptosis of cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes in simulated ischemia/reperfusion . It remains unknown whether the P41180 has function in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced myocardial injure . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the P41180 plays a role in LPS-induced myocardial injury . Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with LPS , with or without pretreatment with the P41180 -specific agonist gadolinium chloride ( GdCl3 ) or the P41180 -specific antagonist NPS2390 . Release of P01375 -α and P05231 from cardiomyocytes was observed . Levels of malonaldehyde ( MDA ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , and activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) were measured . In addition , apoptosis of the cardiomyocytes , [Ca(2+)]i and level of P41180 expression were determined . The results showed that LPS increased cardiomyocytes apoptosis , [Ca(2+)]i , MDA , LDH , P01375 -α , P05231 release , and P41180 protein expression . Compared with LPS treatment alone , pretreatment with GdCl3 further increased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes , MDA , LDH , P01375 -α , P05231 release , [Ca(2+)]i , and the expression of the P41180 protein . Conversely , pretreatment with NPS2390 decreased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes , MDA , LDH , P01375 -α , P05231 release , [Ca(2+)]i and the expression of the P41180 protein . These results demonstrate that LPS could induce cardiomyocyte injury . Moreover , LPS-induced cardiomyocyte injury was related to P41180 -mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis , P01375 -α , P05231 release , and increase of intracellular calcium .
