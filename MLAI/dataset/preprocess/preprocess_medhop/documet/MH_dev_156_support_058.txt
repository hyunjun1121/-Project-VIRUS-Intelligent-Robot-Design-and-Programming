SynGAP- O75970 -CaMKII synaptic complexes regulate p38 Q96HU1 kinase activity and DB01221 receptor-dependent synaptic AMPA receptor potentiation . The synapse contains densely localized and interacting proteins that enable it to adapt to changing inputs . We describe a Ca2+-sensitive protein complex involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor synaptic plasticity . The complex is comprised of MUPPI , a multi-PDZ domain-containing protein ; SynGAP , a synaptic P20936 ; and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase CaMKII . In synapses of hippocampal neurons , SynGAP and CaMKII are brought together by direct physical interaction with the PDZ domains of O75970 , and in this complex , SynGAP is phosphorylated . Ca2+ P62158 binding to CaMKII dissociates it from the O75970 complex , and Ca2+ entering via the NMDAR drives the dephosphorylation of SynGAP . Specific peptide-induced SynGAP dissociation from the O75970 -CaMKII complex results in SynGAP dephosphorylation accompanied by O75791 MAPK inactivation , potentiation of synaptic AMPA responses , and an increase in the number of AMPAR-containing clusters in hippocampal neuron synapses . siRNA-mediated SynGAP knockdown confirmed these results . These data implicate SynGAP in NMDAR- and CaMKII-dependent regulation of AMPAR trafficking .
