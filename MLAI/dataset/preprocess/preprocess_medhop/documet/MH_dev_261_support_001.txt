Epigenetic regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase Q05209 in triple-negative breast cancer . AIMS : The present study showed that the expression of Q05209 is epigenetically regulated . DB00928 ( 5-Azac ) , a DNA hypomethylating agent , significantly increased the expression of Q05209 at low concentrations ( 1μM and 2.5μM ) and decreased the expression of Q05209 at 5μM in the MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 triple-negative breast cancer cell lines . MAIN METHODS : Human MCF-7 , MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were exposed to different concentrations of 5-Azac for 24 and 48h . RT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA expression of Q05209 , P12830 and miRNA-124 . Western blotting was performed to assess the protein expression of various proteins , including Q05209 , P12830 , P26358 and PARP . KEY FINDINGS : 5-Azac , a DNA hypomethylating agent , significantly increased the expression of Q05209 at low concentrations ( 1μM and 2.5μM ) and decreased Q05209 expression at 5μM . We provide the first evidence that Q05209 expression is epigenetically regulated and that it is up-regulated at a lower dose of a P26358 inhibitor in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells . Interestingly , the levels of miRNA-124 were increased only at 5μM , the concentration at which Q05209 expression was suppressed . SIGNIFICANCE : To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report that highlights the therapeutic potential of low-dose 5-Azac for the treatment of TNBC . Therefore , 5-Azac , an agent that has already been tested in acute myeloid leukemia , may be more effective at lower doses for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer .
