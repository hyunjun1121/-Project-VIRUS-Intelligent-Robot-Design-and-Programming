DB06594 : a novel mechanism of antidepressant action involving the melatonergic and the serotonergic system . The clinical finding that depressive disorders are often associated with desynchronization of internal rhythms has encouraged the idea that resetting normal circadian rhythms may have antidepressant potential . DB06594 , a naphthalene analog of melatonin , is both an agonist of human cloned melatonergic MT1 and P02795 receptors and a serotonin P28335 receptor antagonist . DB06594 combines zeitgeber ( synchroniser of the circadian system ) activity with neurotransmitter augmentation properties ( enhances the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in frontal cortex ) . The efficacy of agomelatine in treating depression has been shown in three short-term , pivotal , randomized , placebo-controlled studies . These studies have demonstrated agomelatine to be efficacious in Major Depressive Disorder at the standard dose of 25mg/day , with the possibility of increasing doses to 50mg/day in those patients with insufficient improvement . The number of adverse events during the treatment period was comparable to placebo . Four studies have shown the positive effect of agomelatine on sleep continuity and quality and shortening of sleep latency . Despite these promising data , further studies are needed to examine agomelatine 's efficacy over a longer treatment period .
