The BH3 mimetic DB05764 synergizes with the Q02750 /2 inhibitor selumetinib/AZD6244 to promote O43521 -dependent tumour cell death and inhibit acquired resistance . Tumour cells typically exhibit a G(1) cell cycle arrest in response to the Q02750 /2 [ mitogen-activated protein kinase/ P29323 ( extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ) kinase 1/2 ] inhibitor selumetinib , but do not die , and thus they acquire resistance . In the present study we examined the effect of combining selumetinib with the BH3 [ P10415 ( B-cell lymphoma 2 ) homology domain 3 ] -mimetic P10415 inhibitor DB05764 . Although either drug alone caused little tumour cell death , the two agents combined to cause substantial caspase-dependent cell death and inhibit long-term clonogenic survival of colorectal cancer and melanoma cell lines with P15056 (V600E) or DB01367 mutations . This cell death absolutely required Q07812 ( P10415 -associated X protein ) and was inhibited by RNAi ( RNA interference ) -mediated knockdown of O43521 ( P10415 -interacting mediator of cell death ) in the P15056 (V600E)-positive COLO205 cell line . When colorectal cancer cell lines were treated with selumetinib plus DB05764 we observed a striking reduction in the incidence of cells emerging with acquired resistance to selumetinib . Similar results were observed when we combined DB05764 with the P15056 (V600E)-selective inhibitor PLX4720 , but only in cells expressing P15056 (V600E) . Finally , cancer cells in which acquired resistance to selumetinib arises through P15056 (V600E) amplification remained sensitive to DB05764 , whereas selumetinib-resistant HCT116 cells ( P01116 (G13D) amplification ) were cross-resistant to DB05764 . Thus the combination of a P10415 inhibitor and an P27361 /2 pathway inhibitor is synthetic lethal in P27361 /2-addicted tumour cells , delays the onset of acquired resistance and in some cases overcomes acquired resistance to selumetinib .
