Intra-articular therapy with tumor necrosis factor-Î± antagonists : an update . The aim of the study was to review from the present literature the intra-articular ( IA ) use of the P01375 -blocking drugs . A total of 28 papers about this topic were found through a search in PubMed ; the first publication 's date was July 2003 . These studies include a total of 214 patients affected by 12 different joint diseases that reported a total of 1046 intra-articular therapies carried out in 10 different joint sites . DB00065 and etanercept were the most widely used medications . The safety of this treatment clearly emerges from our analysis , while more difficult was the evaluation of its efficacy . Nevertheless we deduced an ideal patient profile that may better respond to the IA anti- P01375 treatment .
