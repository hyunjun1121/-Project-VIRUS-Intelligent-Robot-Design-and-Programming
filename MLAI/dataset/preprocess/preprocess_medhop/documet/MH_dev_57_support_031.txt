P01298 enhances plasma glucocorticoid concentration in rats : possible role in hypoglycemic stress . The acute bolus intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) administration of pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) dose-dependently enhanced the plasma concentration of corticosterone ( P10515 ) in hypophysectomized/ DB01285 replaced rats , but not that of aldosterone . Minimal and maximal effective doses were 10(-12) and 10(-10) mol/rat , respectively , and maximal P10515 increase occurred between 60 and 120 min after PP injection . P01308 ( 1 U/kg , i.p. ) evoked a net decrease in the blood glucose concentration , and marked rises in the plasma levels of PP and P10515 , that attained their maximum at 60 and 120 min , respectively . The effects of insulin were annulled by the simultaneous injection of 0.5 mg/kg atropine . The effects of 1 U/kg insulin and 10(-10) mol/rat PP on P10515 were not additive ; atropine did not affect P10515 response to PP or PP plus insulin , though annulling that to insulin alone . Taken together these findings suggest that PP plays a physiologic role in the rat as modulator of the adrenal response to the insulin-induced hypoglycemic stress .
