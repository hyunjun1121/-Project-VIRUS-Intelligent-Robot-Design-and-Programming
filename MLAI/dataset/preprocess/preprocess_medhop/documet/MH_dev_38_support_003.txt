Alteration of intracellular histamine H2 receptor cycling precedes antagonist-induced upregulation . Long-term administration of a histamine H2 receptor ( P25021 ) antagonist ( inverse agonist ) induces upregulation of P25021 in parietal cells , which may be relevant to the rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid that occurs after withdrawal of treatment . The mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown . We hypothesized that the P25021 upregulation could be related to receptor trafficking and used P25021 -green fluorescent protein ( P25021 -GFP ) to test the hypothesis . Human P25021 -GFP was generated and functionally expressed in P29320 -293 cells . Binding of the P25021 antagonist [3H]tiotidine was performed to quantify P25021 expression , and P25021 -GFP was imaged in living cells by confocal and evanescent wave microscopy . The binding affinity of [3H]tiotidine was not significantly different between P25021 -GFP- and wild-type P25021 -expressing P29320 -293 cells , both of which had constitutive activity of adenylate cyclase . Visualization of P25021 -GFP revealed that the agonist-induced P25021 internalization and the antagonist-induced recycling of the internalized P25021 from the recycling endosome within 2 h . Long exposure to the antagonist increased GFP fluorescence in the plasma membrane and also induced upregulation of P25021 -GFP estimated by the binding assay , whereas long exposure to the agonist enhanced degradative trafficking of P25021 -GFP . We examined whether the upregulation reflected an increase in receptor synthesis . Treatment with antagonist did not augment P25021 mRNA , and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide had no effect on P25021 upregulation . These findings suggested that upon exposure to an antagonist ( inverse agonist ) , the equilibrium between receptor endocytosis and recycling is altered before P25021 upregulation , probably via suppressing P25021 degradation .
