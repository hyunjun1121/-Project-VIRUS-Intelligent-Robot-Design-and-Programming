Inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism reduce DNA and nuclear fragmentation induced by P01375 plus cycloheximide in U937 cells . U937 human myeloid leukemia cells are induced to apoptosis by tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) plus cycloheximide ( CHX ) . We have analysed the effect of various inhibitors of the arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolism on several features of this process . The formation of high molecular weight and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments as well as nuclear fragmentation were reduced by inhibitors of P09917 ( BWA4C and BWB70C ) , P09917 activating protein ( MK-886 ) , and cytosolic P04054 ( AACOCF3 ) . None of these agents blocked the morphological changes detected by microscopy or flow cytometry , phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface or Caspase 3-like activation . AA also induced nuclear fragmentation at a concentration of 1-20 microM . However , the mechanisms by which these inhibitors act , remain unexplained since there was no P09917 expression in the U937 cells and no AA release followed their stimulation with P01375 plus CHX .
