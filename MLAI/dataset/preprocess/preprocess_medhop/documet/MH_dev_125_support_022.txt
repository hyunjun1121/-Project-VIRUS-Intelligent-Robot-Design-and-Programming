DB01017 suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by increasing tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) that are secreted by activated T cells play a significant role in degradation of the extracellular matrix around the blood vessels and facilitate autoimmune neuroinflammation ; however , it remains unclear how MMPs act in lesion formation and whether MMP-targeted therapies are effective in disease suppression . In the present study , we attempted to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) by administration of small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) for P08253 , P14780 , and minocycline , all of which have MMP-inhibiting functions . DB01017 , but not siRNAs , significantly suppressed disease development . In situ zymography revealed that gelatinase activities were almost completely suppressed in the spinal cords of minocycline-treated animals , while significant gelatinase activities were measured in the EAE lesions of control animals . However , P08253 and P14780 mRNAs and proteins in the spinal cords of treated rats were unexpectedly upregulated . At the same time , mRNA for tissue inhibitors of MMPs ( P01033 ) -1 and -2 were also upregulated . The EnzChek Gelatinase/Collagenase assay using tissue containing native MMPs and TIMPs demonstrated that gelatinase activity levels in the spinal cords of treated rats were suppressed to the same level as those in normal spinal cord tissues . Finally , double immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that P14780 immunoreactivities of treated rats were almost the same as those of control rats and that P14780 and P01033 immunoreactivities were colocalized in the spinal cord . These findings suggest that minocycline administration does not suppress MMPs at mRNA and protein levels but that it suppresses gelatinase activities by upregulating TIMPs . Thus , MMP-targeted therapies should be designed after the mechanisms of candidate drugs have been considered .
