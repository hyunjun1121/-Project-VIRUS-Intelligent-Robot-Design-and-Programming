Effects of phenytoin , ketamine , and atropine methyl nitrate in preventing neuromuscular toxicity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors soman and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate . Toxic manifestations of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( P22303 -I ) include muscle twitching and muscle fiber necrosis , in addition to muscarinic manifestations of acetylcholine excess . The P22303 -Is pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate ( soman ) or diisopropylphosphorofluoridate ( DB00677 ) were administered to rats to produce spontaneous muscle fiber discharges . Soman produced discharges that arose primarily from the central nervous system ( CNS ) , while those due to DB00677 were generated from the peripheral nerves as well as the CNS . Three drugs were tested for their potential to reduce muscle fiber discharges : atropine methyl nitrate ( Q9BXJ7 ) , ketamine , and phenytoin . DB01221 caused a significant decrease in discharges of CNS origin , while Q9BXJ7 and phenytoin had no effect . For muscle fiber discharges of peripheral origin , all three drugs produced a significant drop in muscle fiber discharges , but phenytoin showed slightly more efficacy than the others . P22303 -I-induced muscle hyperactivity arises from actions on the CNS and on the peripheral nerve in varying proportions for different P22303 -Is . Treatment for the toxicity of P22303 -Is on muscle may be accomplished by administering drugs with distinctive pharmacological actions at target sites in the CNS and peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) where P22303 -Is exert their effects . By attenuating the effects of P22303 -Is at specific CNS or PNS sites , the neuromuscular toxicity can be reduced in a manner specific to the characteristic sites of toxicity of each P22303 -I .
