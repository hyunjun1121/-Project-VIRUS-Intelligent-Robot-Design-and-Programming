Molecular cloning and radioligand binding characterization of the chemokine receptor P51681 from rhesus macaque and human . The aim of this study was to determine if macaque represents a suitable species for the pre-clinical evaluation of novel P51681 antagonists , such as maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) . To do this we cloned and expressed P51681 from rhesus macaque and compared the binding properties of [ 125I ] -MIP-1beta and [ 3H ] -maraviroc with human recombinant P51681 . [ 125I ] -MIP-1beta bound with similar high affinity to P51681 from macaque ( K(d) = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM ) and human ( K(d) = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM ) and with similar kinetic properties . In competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque P51681 was also similar to human P51681 . DB04835 inhibited binding of [ 125I ] -MIP-1beta to P51681 from macaque and human with similar potency ( IC50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nM and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nM , respectively ) and antagonised MIP-1beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through P51681 from macaque and human with similar potency ( IC50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nM and 12.07 +/- 1.89 , respectively ) . [ 3H ] -maraviroc bound with high affinity to P51681 from macaque ( K(d) = 1.36+/-0.07 nM ) and human ( K(d) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nM ) , but was found to dissociate approximately 10-fold more quickly from macaque P51681 . However , as with the human receptor , maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity , potent functional antagonist of macaque P51681 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology , safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel P51681 antagonists .
