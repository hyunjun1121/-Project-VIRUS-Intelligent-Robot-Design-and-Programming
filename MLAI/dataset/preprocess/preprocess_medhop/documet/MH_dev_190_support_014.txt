A nitric oxide-dependent cross-talk between class I and III histone deacetylases accelerates skin repair . In a mouse model of skin repair we found that the class I-IIa histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A accelerated tissue regeneration . Unexpectedly , this effect was suppressed by Sirtinol , a class III histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) (sirtuin)-selective inhibitor . The role of sirtuins ( SIRTs ) was then investigated by using resveratrol and a novel Q96EB6 -2-3 activator , the MC2562 compound we synthesized recently . Both resveratrol and MC2562 were effective in accelerating wound repair . The local administration of natural or synthetic SIRT activators , in fact , significantly accelerated skin regeneration by increasing keratinocyte proliferation . In vitro experiments revealed that the activation of SIRTs stimulated keratinocyte proliferation via endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation and NO production . In this condition , the class I member Q92769 was found S-nitrosylated on cysteine , a post-transduction modification associated with loss of activity and DNA binding capacity . After deacetylase inhibitor or SIRT activator treatment , ChIP showed , in fact , a significant Q92769 detachment from the promoter region of insulin growth factor I ( P05019 ) , fibroblast growth factor 10 ( O15520 ) , and Epithelial Growth Factor ( P01133 ) , which may be the final recipients and effectors of the SIRT-NO-HDAC signaling cascade . Consistently , the effect of SIRT activators was reduced in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) , a general inhibitor of NO synthesis . In conclusion , the NO-dependent cross-talk among class III and I histone deacetylases suggests an unprecedented signaling pathway important for skin repair .
