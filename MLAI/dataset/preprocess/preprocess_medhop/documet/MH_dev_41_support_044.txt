Allogeneic stem cell transplantation using alemtuzumab-containing regimens in severe aplastic anemia . DB00087 , a humanized anti- P31358 , IgG1 monoclonal antibody , is used to reduce graft-versus- host disease ( GVHD ) and aid engraftment after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . Its associated low incidence of GVHD makes it an attractive alternative to anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) in transplant conditioning regimen for severe aplastic anaemia ( P0DJI8 ) . We have reviewed the use of alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen for HSCT in P0DJI8 and show that it results in sustained haematological engraftment , a very low incidence of chronic GVHD without an increase in viral infections . Intriguingly , alemtuzumab appears to induce tolerance post-HSCT with the findings of stable mixed T cell chimerism with full donor myeloid chimerism and the absence of chronic GVHD , and which persist on withdrawal of post-graft immunosuppression . Finally , its low toxicity profile may permit future application of HSCT to older patients with P0DJI8 who fail to respond to immunosuppressive therapy .
