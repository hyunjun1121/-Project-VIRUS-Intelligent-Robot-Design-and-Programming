Application of HapMap data to the evaluation of 8 candidate genes for pediatric slow transit constipation . BACKGROUND : Slow transit constipation ( P52823 ) affects up to 3 % of all children and is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic constipation in children . We conducted a pilot study to investigate whether genes encoding neurotransmitters ( P20366 , Q9UHF0 , P01282 , NOS1 ) and receptors ( P25103 , P21452 , P29371 , P10721 ) could be responsible for P52823 . METHODS : One hundred seventeen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , distributed among the candidate genes , were selected from HapMap data and genotyped using Sequenom ( San Diego , CA ) technology in 35 affected families . Evaluation of association was performed by transmission disequilibrium test and multilocus analysis . RESULTS : Five SNPs ( rs3771863 , rs4580655 , rs11722288 , rs4563545 , and rs3782221 ) in the P25103 , P29371 , P10721 , and NOS1 genes were found to be potentially associated with P52823 , although the significance of these results does not withstand correction for multiple testing . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate that 5 SNPs in the NOS1 , P25103 , P29371 , and P10721 genes could be involved in P52823 , especially rs3771863 in intron 1 of P25103 , which showed the highest association .
