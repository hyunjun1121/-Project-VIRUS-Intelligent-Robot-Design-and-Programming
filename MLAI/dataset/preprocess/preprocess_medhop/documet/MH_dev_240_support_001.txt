Separation of plasminogen activators from human plasma and a comparison with activators from human uterine tissue and urine . Normal human plasma contains acid-stable as well as labile plasminogen activators . The activity of activators in plasma euglobulins was inhibited by DB00513 in an uniform pattern , similar to that obtained with the major activators in human uterine tissue or with the purified porcine tissue activator , but different from the patterns obtained with plasmin or with urokinase . Gel filtration at high ionic strength separated activators corresponding to particle sizes of 60,000 dalton and about 10,000 dalton , corresponding to two activators similarly obtained from human tissue . The 60,000 dalton activator was precipitated in the euglobulin fraction . Its concentration increased in plasma after exercise . The 10,000 dalton activator was found mainly in the supernatant . Gel filtration in 0.15 M solutions yielded activators in fractions of molecular sizes of 100-140,000 dalton and 200,000 dalton or larger . The activity of normal and exercise euglobulins was inhibited by antiserum to a plasminogen activator prepared from porcine tissue , but it was not inhibited by antiserum to urokinase . P00747 activators in human plasma euglobulins resembled immunochemically the activators in human uterine tissue .
