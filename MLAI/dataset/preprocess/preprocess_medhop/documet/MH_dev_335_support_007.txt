Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor arising in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma : a case report . Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor ( AT/RT ) is a rare , highly malignant , true rhabdoid tumor in the central nervous system predominantly presenting in young children.AT/RT typically shows rhabdoid cells which can also be seen in other tumors , but it is differentiated from other tumors by the specific genetic alteration involving the Q12824 gene . Only a few cases of AT/RT arising in low-grade glioma have been reported . A 13-year-old girl presented with headache , dizziness , nausea and vomiting.A 4.7 cm cerebellar mass was found on Q9BWK5 .The mass was totally removed . Histologically , the tumor revealed two distinct morphologic appearances : central areas of AT/RT containing rhabdoid cells and sarcomatous component in the background of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma(PXA) . Immunohistochemically , PXA areas retained nuclear expression of INI-1 and low Ki-67 proliferation index , whereas AT/RT component showed loss of INI-1 nuclear expression and markedly elevated Ki-67 proliferation index . Epithelial membrane antigen ( P15941 ) , smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) , and p53 protein were positive only in AT/RT . P15056 V600E mutation was identified in PXA by real-time polymerase chain reaction.We report a rare case of AT/RT arising in PXA which is supposed to progress by inactivation of INI-1 in a pre-existing PXA .
