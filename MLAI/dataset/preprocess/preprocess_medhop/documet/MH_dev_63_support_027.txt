DB00909 block of cloned human T-type voltage-gated calcium channels . DB00909 ( ZNS ) is a multi-target antiepileptic drug reported to be efficient in the treatment of both partial and generalized seizures , with T-type Ca(2+) channel blockade being one of its proposed mechanisms of action . In this study , we systematically investigated electrophysiological effects of ZNS on cloned human Ca(v)3.1-3.3 Ca(2+) channels in a heterologous P29320 -293 expression system using whole cell patch-clamp technique . Concentration-response studies were performed in the range from 5 microM to 2mM for Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channels exhibiting a 15.4-30.8 % reduction of Ca(2+) influx within the maximum therapeutic plasma range ( 50-200 microM ZNS ) . The other T-type Ca(2+) channel entities , Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 , were even less sensitive to ZNS . Both voltage- and concentration-dependence of inactivation kinetics remained unchanged for Ca(v)3.2 VGCC , whereas Ca(v)3.1 and Q9P0X4 exhibited minor , though significant reduction of inactivation-tau . Interestingly , ZNS block of Ca(v)3.2 VGCCs was not use-dependent and remained unaffected by changes in the holding potential . Steady-state inactivation studies did not display a significant shift in steady-state availability of Ca(v)3.2 channels at 100 microM ZNS ( DeltaV(1/2)=3.1mV , p=0.071 ) . Our studies indicate that ZNS is a moderate blocker of human Ca(v)3 T-type Ca(2+) channels with little or no effect on Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) channel inactivation kinetics , use- and state-dependence of blockade . These results suggest that T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibition only partially contributes to the anti-absence activity of ZNS antiepileptic drug .
