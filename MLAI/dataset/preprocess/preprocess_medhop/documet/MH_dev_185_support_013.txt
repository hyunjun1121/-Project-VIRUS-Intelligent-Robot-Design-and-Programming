Distinctive clinicopathological features of Ki-ras mutated colorectal cancers . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : We explored the relationship between the mutation pattern of Ki-ras and the clinicopathological features of colorectal cancers ( CRCs ) . METHODS : Relationships between clinicopathological parameters and Ki-ras mutation status were analyzed in 255 CRC patients using the chi-square and student t-tests . Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test . RESULTS : Ki-ras mutation occurred in 43.9 % of tumors , and 83 % affected codon 12 . The most frequent mutations were P19440 - > Q6IB77 ( DB00145 - > DB00128 ) ( 37.5 % ) , followed by P19440 - > GTT ( DB00145 - > DB00161 ) ( 31.3 % ) , both in codon 12 . The frequency of Ki-ras mutation was similar for different tumor stages ( 38.2-47.8 % ) . The mucin component of tumors was significantly associated with Ki-ras mutation . The 4-year overall and disease-free survival was 61 % and 54 % , respectively , for patients with Ki-ras mutated tumors , and 73 % and 60 % for patients with nonmutated tumors ( not statistically significant ) . Patients with Ki-ras mutated tumors had lower plasma folate ( 24 ng/dl ) than those bearing nonmutated tumors ( 37 ng/dl ) . Patients with G- > T Ki-ras mutations had the lowest folate level ( 22 ng/dl ) , followed by those with G- > A mutations ( 25 ng/dl ) . CONCLUSIONS : Ki-ras mutated colorectal tumors have a higher mucin production and higher differentiation , and are associated with lower plasma folate levels and a relatively poorer disease outcome .
