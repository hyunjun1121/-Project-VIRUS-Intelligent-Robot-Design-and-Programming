Multiple messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts and revised gene organization of the human DB00024 receptor . Northern blot analysis of human DB00024 receptor ( hTSHR ) messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression has previously demonstrated multiple species of transcripts in the thyroid gland , suggesting the presence of multiple transcription initiation sites , alternatively spliced forms or alternate polyadenylation ( poly(A) ) sites . The first two have already been reported elsewhere . To clarify alternate poly(A) sites in the hTSHR gene , the present study was designed to characterize three full-length hTSHR cDNAs with distinct poly(A) signals that we have previously cloned . The comparison of the nucleotide sequencing data on the 3'UTR of these three clones to the Draft Human Genome in NCBI database revealed that the 3' segment of exon 10 of hTSHR gene contains three tandem repeats of the poly(A) sites , from which are expressed three full-length P16473 mRNAs with distinct 3'UTR length . The longest one appears to be a predominant transcript . From these data , together with ( i ) the previously reported organization of hTSHR genome and ( ii ) use of the Draft Human Genome to localize the unidentified sequence in the alternatively spliced form of truncated hTSHR , we propose the complete structure of hTSHR gene . Rather than 10 exons , our analysis suggests that hTSHR gene seems to contain 13 exons and 12 introns . At least three full-length P16473 mRNAs with distinct poly(A) sites and five alternatively spliced forms of P16473 mRNAs are expressed from the single hTSHR gene .
