Candidate genetic markers and the risk of restenosis after coronary angioplasty . The aim of the present study was to test for possible associations between candidate gene polymorphisms and the risk of restenosis and recurrent restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) without stenting . We followed up 511 PTCA patients , and restenosis and recurrent restenosis were defined according to angiographical criteria . Genotyping of the beta-fibrinogen -455 G/A , glycoprotein ( GP ) IIIa PlA1/PlA2 , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) 4G/5G , factor V Leiden 1691 G/A , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) -238 G/A , TNFalpha -308 G/A , interleukin ( IL ) -1alpha -889 C/T , IL-1beta -511 C/T , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( P42898 ) 677 C/T and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) 4 b/a gene polymorphisms was performed by PCR and restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism-based techniques . One hundred and sixty patients ( 31.3 % ) developed restenosis and in 130 of these patients , of whom 123 were available for analysis , a second PTCA without stenting was performed . Of these patients , 35 ( 28.5 % ) developed recurrent restenosis . None of the investigated genotypes were associated with the risk of restenosis or recurrent restenosis after PTCA . The degree of stenosis before and immediately after PTCA and the severity of the lesion were independent predictors for restenosis after PTCA . In conclusion , there was no association between the beta-fibrinogen -455 G/A , GP IIIa PlA1/A2 , P05121 4G/5G , factor V Leiden 1691 G/A , TNFalpha -238 G/A , TNFalpha -308 G/A , IL-1alpha -889 C/T , the IL-1beta -511 C/T , P42898 677 C/T and P29474 4 b/a gene polymorphisms and the risk of restenosis after PTCA as well as recurrent restenosis after repeated PTCA .
