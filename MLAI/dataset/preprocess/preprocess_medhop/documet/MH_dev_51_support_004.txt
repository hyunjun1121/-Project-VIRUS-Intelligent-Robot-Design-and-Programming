DB00559 , an endothelin receptor antagonist , ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis : the role of P01375 -α in the induction of endothelin system genes . OBJECTIVE : Endothelins ( ETs ) are involved in several inflammatory events . The present study investigated the efficacy of DB00559 , a dual P25101 /ETB receptor antagonist , in collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in mice . TREATMENT : CIA was induced in DBA/1J mice . Arthritic mice were treated with DB00559 ( 100 mg/kg ) once a day , starting from the day when arthritis was clinically detectable . METHODS : CIA progression was assessed by measurements of visual clinical score , paw swelling and hypernociception . Histological changes , neutrophil infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in the joints . Gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice was evaluated by microarray technology . PreproET-1 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes of mice and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was evaluated by real-time PCR . The differences were evaluated by one-way Q9UNW9 or Student 's t test . RESULTS : Oral treatment with DB00559 markedly ameliorated the clinical aspects of CIA ( visual clinical score , paw swelling and hyperalgesia ) . DB00559 treatment also reduced joint damage , leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels ( IL-1β , TNFα and Q16552 ) in the joint tissues . Changes in gene expression in the lymph nodes of arthritic mice returned to the levels of the control mice after DB00559 treatment . PreproET mRNA expression increased in PBMCs from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients but returned to basal level in PBMCs from patients under anti- P01375 therapy . In-vitro treatment of PBMCs with TNFα upregulated ET system genes . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that ET receptor antagonists , such as DB00559 , might be useful in controlling RA . Moreover , it seems that ET mediation of arthritis is triggered by TNFα .
