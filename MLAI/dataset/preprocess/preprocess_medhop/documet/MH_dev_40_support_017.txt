Current and emerging biologics for ulcerative colitis . Conventional medical treatment for ulcerative colitis can have limited efficacy or severe adverse reactions requiring additional treatment or colectomy . Hence , different biological agents that target specific immunological pathways are be-ing investigated for treating ulcerative colitis . Anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) agents were the first biologics to be used for treating inflammatory bowel disease . For example , infliximab and adalimumab , which are anti- P01375 agents , are be-ing used for treating ulcerative colitis . Recently , DB06674 , another anti- P01375 agent , and vedolizumab , an anti-adhesion therapy , have been approved for ulcerative colitis by the U.S . Food and Drug Administration . In addition , new medications such as tofacitinib , a Janus kinase inhibitor , and etrolizumab , another anti-adhesion therapy , are emerging as therapeutic agents . Therefore , there is a need for further studies to select appropriate patient groups for these biologics and to improve the outcomes of ulcerative colitis treatment through appropriate medical usage .
