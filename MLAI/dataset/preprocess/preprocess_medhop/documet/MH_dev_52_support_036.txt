Novel function of histamine signaling in hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis : DB11320 H1 receptors protect and H2 receptors accelerate atherosclerosis . DB11320 is not only essential for acute inflammatory reactions , but it also participates in a chronic inflammatory disorder . We generated apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) and histamine receptors ( HHRs ) , including the major H1 and H2 receptors ( P35367 , P25021 ) double knockout mice ( DKO ) to clarify the role of HHRs in hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis , in which apoE-KO and DKO mice were fed a high cholesterol diet . We found that pronounced hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerotic progression occurred in P35367 /apoE-DKO mice , but in P25021 /apoE-DKO mice less atherosclerosis , despite pro-atherogenic serum cholesterol levels compared with apoE-KO mice . Furthermore , the increased expressions of scavenger receptors ( SRs ) , such as SR-A , P16671 and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 ( P78380 ) , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NFÎºB ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( P13500 ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) or liver X receptor ( LXR ) -related inflammatory signaling factors , were consistent with the pro-atherogenic phenotype of P25021 /apoE-DKO mice . We hypothesize that histamine/ P35367 and P25021 signaling has conflicting innate functions , inflammatory/atherogenic and anti-inflammatory/anti-atherogenic actions , and that there are innate links between histamine signaling and hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis , independently of serum cholesterol metabolism . Specific histamine signaling blockers , in particular , P25021 blockers , are a possible novel therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis .
