DB00024 / P16473 Signaling Suppresses Fatty Acid Synthase ( P49327 ) Expression in Adipocytes . DB00024 / P16473 signaling plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in adipocytes . However , the precise mechanisms are not known . In the present study , we determined the effect of DB00024 on fatty acid synthase ( P49327 ) expression , and explored the underlying mechanisms . In vitro , DB00024 reduced P49327 expression in both mRNA and protein levels in mature adipocytes and was accompanied by protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation , DB02527 -response element binding protein ( CREB ) phosphorylation , as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) and c-Jun NH2 -terminal kinase ( JNK ) activation . DB00024 -induced downregulation of P49327 was partially abolished by inhibition of PKA and P29323 , but not JNK . P16473 and P49327 expression in visceral tissue was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice with diet-induced obesity compared with control animals , whereas thyroid P16473 expression was normal . These findings suggest that activation of P16473 directly inhibits P49327 expression in mature adipocytes , possibly mediated by PKA and P29323 . In obese animals , this function of P16473 seems to be counteracted . The precise mechanisms need further investigation .
