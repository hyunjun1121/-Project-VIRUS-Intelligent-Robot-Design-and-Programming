DB00092 ( anti- P06729 ) causes a selective reduction in circulating effector memory T cells ( Tem ) and relative preservation of central memory T cells ( Tcm ) in psoriasis . BACKGROUND : DB00092 ( anti- P06729 ) biological therapy selectively targets effector memory T cells ( Tem ) in psoriasis vulgaris , a model Type 1 autoimmune disease . METHODS : Circulating leukocytes were phenotyped in patients receiving alefacept for moderate to severe psoriasis . RESULTS : In all patients , this treatment caused a preferential decrease in effector memory T cells ( P32248 - CD45RA- ) ( mean 63 % reduction ) for both P01730 + and CD8+ Tem , while central memory T cells ( Tcm ) ( P32248 +CD45RA- ) were less affected , and na√Øve T cells ( P32248 +CD45RA+ ) were relatively spared . Circulating CD8+ effector T cells and Type 1 T cells ( P01579 -producing ) were also significantly reduced . CONCLUSION : DB00092 causes a selective reduction in circulating effector memory T cells ( Tem ) and relative preservation of central memory T cells ( Tcm ) in psoriasis .
