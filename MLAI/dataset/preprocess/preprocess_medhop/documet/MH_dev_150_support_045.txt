Increased dihydrotestosterone receptor levels in high-stage renal adenocarcinoma . Primary renal adenocarcinoma tissue , metastatic deposits , and normal kidney parenchyma from 16 patients were assayed for sex hormone receptors by dextran-coated charcoal adsorption and sucrose gradient centrifugation techniques . DB02901 receptors ( P10275 ) were found in all renal carcinomatous tissue ( 20/20 ) and in 93 % ( 13/14 ) autologous normal kidneys analyzed . DB00624 receptors were found in 84 % ( 16/19 ) of tumors and 93 % ( 14/15 ) or normal kidneys analyzed . Estrogen receptors in small amounts ( ER ) were detected in only 5 % ( 1/19 ) of tumors and in 7 % ( 1/15 ) of normal kidneys . Progesterone receptors ( PR ) in low quantities were detected in 30 % ( 6/20 ) of renal tumors and in 40 % ( 6/15 ) of normal kidneys . P10275 levels in high-stage tumors ( DB00279 , DB00451 ) were significantly elevated over levels in autologous normal kidney , whereas in low-stage tumors localized to the kidney ( T1 and P24752 tumors ) P10275 levels were not significantly different from autologous normal kidney . The mean levels of P10275 in high-stage kidney tumors were significantly elevated over levels in low-stage tumors ( P less than 0.001 ) . P10275 estimation in renal neoplasms may help in biologic staging of renal adenocarcinoma and could define a group of patients in whom anti-androgen therapy may be worth a trial .
