Cyclophilin interactions with incoming human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsids with opposing effects on infectivity in human cells . P62937 ( CypA ) is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that binds to the capsid protein ( CA ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) and by doing so facilitates HIV-1 replication . Although CypA is incorporated into HIV-1 virions by virtue of CypA-Gag interactions that occur during virion assembly , in this study we show that the CypA-CA interaction that occurs following the entry of the viral capsid into target cells is the major determinant of CypA 's effects on HIV-1 replication . Specifically , by using normal and CypA-deficient Jurkat cells , we demonstrate that the presence of CypA in the target and not the virus-producing cell enhances HIV-1 infectivity . Moreover , disruption of the CypA-CA interaction with cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) inhibits HIV-1 infectivity only if the target cell expresses CypA . The effect of DB00091 on HIV-1 infection of human cells varies according to which particular cell line is used as a target , and CA mutations that confer DB00091 resistance and dependence exert their effects only if target cells , and not if virus-producing cells , are treated with DB00091 . The differential effects of DB00091 on HIV-1 infection in different human cells appear not to be caused by polymorphisms in the recently described retrovirus restriction factor TRIM5alpha . We speculate that CypA and/or CypA-related proteins affect the fate of incoming HIV-1 capsid either directly or by modulating interactions with unidentified host cell factors .
