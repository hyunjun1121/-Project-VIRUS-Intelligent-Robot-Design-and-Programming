Partially deglycosylated equine LH preferentially activates beta-arrestin-dependent signaling at the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor . Deglycosylated DB00094 is known to trigger poor Galphas coupling while efficiently binding its receptor . In the present study , we tested the possibility that a deglycosylated equine LH ( eLHdg ) might be able to selectively activate beta-arrestin-dependent signaling . We compared native eLH to an eLH derivative [ i.e. truncated eLHbeta ( Delta121-149 ) combined with asparagine56-deglycosylated eLHalpha ( eLHdg ) ] previously reported as an antagonist of DB02527 accumulation at the DB00094 receptor ( P23945 ) . We confirmed that , when used in conjunction with DB00094 , eLHdg acted as an antagonist for DB02527 accumulation in P29320 -293 cells stably expressing the P23945 . Furthermore , when used alone at concentrations up to 1 nM , eLHdg had no detectable agonistic activity on DB02527 accumulation , protein kinase A activity or DB02527 -responsive element-dependent transcriptional activity . At higher concentrations , however , a weak agonistic action was observed with eLHdg , whereas eLH led to robust responses whatever the concentration . Both eLH and eLHdg triggered receptor internalization and led to beta-arrestin recruitment . Both eLH and eLHdg triggered P29323 and ribosomal protein ( rp ) S6 phosphorylation at 1 nM . The depletion of endogenous beta-arrestins had only a partial effect on eLH-induced P29323 and rpS6 phosphorylation . In contrast , P29323 and rpS6 phosphorylation was completely abolished at all time points in beta-arrestin-depleted cells . Together , these results show that eLHdg has the ability to preferentially activate beta-arrestin-dependent signaling at the P23945 . This finding provides a new conceptual and experimental framework to revisit the physiological meaning of gonadotropin structural heterogeneity . Importantly , it also opens a field of possibilities for the development of selective modulators of gonadotropin receptors .
