Differential expression of retinoic acid receptor-beta isoforms during chick limb ontogeny . Retinoids influence both morphogenetic events and differentiation during development of the vertebrate limb . These effects are mediated through nuclear retinoid receptors , which modulate target gene expression . We report here the cloning and characterization of three promoter- and splicing-variants of the retinoic acid receptor-beta ( P10826 ) from chick . These receptor isoforms are independently expressed during limb development . RAR beta 2 but not RAR beta 1 transcripts are enriched three-fold in the posterior limb bud , reflecting the increased RA concentrations in this region . RAR beta 1 transcripts are initially present throughout the limb bud mesenchyme and ectoderm , then become restricted within perichondrial regions and loose connective tissue of the limb . RAR beta 1 expression closely overlaps that of P13591 ( neural cell adhesion molecule ) and tenascin in non-neuronal tissues . RAR beta 2 transcripts are present within a subset of those limb tissues which express RAR beta 1 . In the early limb bud RAR beta 2 transcripts are detected in proximal limb mesenchyme and in the initial mesenchymal condensate . In older limbs RAR beta 2 mRNAs are abundant in cells lateral to the digit cartilage . Neither RAR beta 1 nor RAR beta 2 transcripts are associated specifically with regions of limb cell death . The differential expression and regulation of RAR beta isoforms suggests these variants may have different roles in limb development .
