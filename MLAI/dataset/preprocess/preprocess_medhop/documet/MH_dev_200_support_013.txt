( N ) -methanocarba-2MeSADP ( MRS2365 ) is a subtype-specific agonist that induces rapid desensitization of the P47900 receptor of human platelets . DB00640 diphosphate ( ADP ) initiates and maintains sustained aggregation of platelets through simultaneous activation of both the Gq-coupled P47900 receptor and the Gi-coupled Q9H244 receptor . We recently described the synthesis and P47900 receptor-specific agonist activity of ( N ) -methanocarba-2MeSADP ( MRS2365 ) . Consequences of selective activation of the P47900 receptor by MRS2365 have been further examined in human platelets . Whereas MRS2365 alone only induced shape change , addition of MRS2365 following epinephrine treatment , which activates the Gi/z-linked , alpha2A-adrenergic receptor , resulted in sustained aggregation that was indistinguishable from that observed with ADP . Conversely , the platelet shape change promoted by ADP in the presence of the P08514 /IIIa antagonist eptifibatide was similar to that promoted by MRS2365 . Preaddition of the high affinity P47900 receptor antagonist MRS2500 inhibited the effect of MRS2365 , whereas addition of MRS2500 subsequent to MRS2365 reversed the MRS2365-induced shape change . Preactivation of the P47900 receptor with MRS2365 for 2 min resulted in marked loss of capacity of ADP to induce aggregation as evidenced by a greater than 20-fold rightward shift in the concentration effect curve of ADP . This inhibitory effect of P47900 receptor activation was dependent on the concentration of MRS2365 ( EC50 = 34 nm ) . The inhibitory effect of preincubation with MRS2365 was circumvented by activation of the Gq-coupled 5- Q13049 receptor suggesting that MRS2365 induces loss of the ADP response as a consequence of desensitization of the Gq-coupled P47900 receptor . The time course of MRS2365-induced loss of aggregation response to epinephrine was similar to that observed with ADP . These results further demonstrate the P47900 receptor selectivity of MRS2365 and illustrate the occurrence of agonist-induced desensitization of the P47900 receptor of human platelets studied in the absence of Q9H244 receptor activation .
