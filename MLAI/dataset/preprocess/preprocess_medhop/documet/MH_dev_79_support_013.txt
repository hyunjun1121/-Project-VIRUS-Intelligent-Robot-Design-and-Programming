Acute P34969 receptor activation increases DB01221 -evoked currents and differentially alters DB01221 receptor subunit phosphorylation and trafficking in hippocampal neurons . BACKGROUND : N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptors are regulated by several G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) as well as receptor tyrosine kinases . Serotonin ( 5-HT ) type 7 receptors are expressed throughout the brain including the thalamus and hippocampus . Long-term ( 2-24 h ) activation of P34969 receptors promotes the expression of neuroprotective growth factor receptors , including the platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) Î² receptors which can protect neurons against DB01221 -induced neurotoxicity . RESULTS : In contrast to long-term activation of P34969 receptors , acute ( 5 min ) treatment of isolated hippocampal neurons with the P34969 receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine ( 5-CT ) enhances DB01221 -evoked peak currents and this increase in peak currents is blocked by the P34969 receptor antagonist , SB 269970 . In hippocampal slices , acute P34969 receptor activation increases Q9UHB4 DB01221 receptor subunit phosphorylation and differentially alters the phosphorylation state of the Q13224 and Q12879 subunits . DB01221 receptor subunit cell surface expression is also differentially altered by P34969 receptor agonists : Q13224 cell surface expression is decreased whereas Q9UHB4 and Q12879 surface expression are not significantly altered . CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the negative regulatory effects of long-term activation of P34969 receptors on DB01221 receptor signaling , acute activation of P34969 receptors promotes DB01221 receptor activity . These findings highlight the potential for temporally differential regulation of DB01221 receptors by the P34969 receptor .
