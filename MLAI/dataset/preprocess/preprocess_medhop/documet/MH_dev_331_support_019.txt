Cytokine responses of intestinal epithelial-like Caco-2 cells to non-pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic yeasts in the presence of butyric acid . Candida albicans , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their cell wall components , zymosan and glucan , have been shown to stimulate interleukin-8 ( P10145 /CXCL-8 ) production by intestinal epithelial cell-like Caco-2 cells pre-cultured with 10 mM butyric acid . We examined in this study whether these yeasts also altered the production of other cytokines and cyclooxygenases ( COXs ) by Caco-2 cells . Culturing Caco-2 cells with 10 mM butyric acid and 15 % FBS for 4 days enhanced the basal levels of mRNA encoding P05231 , P10145 , Q14116 , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 , stem cell factor , transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1 , TGF-beta3 , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , P23219 , and P35354 , but not of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) and TGF-beta2 . The inclusion of live S. cerevisiae or C. albicans further enhanced the production of P10145 , but not of the other cytokines and COXs . The non-pathogenic yeasts , C. kefyr , C. utilis , C. versatilis , Kluyveromyces lactis , K. marxianus , Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii , used for the production of fermented foods and probiotics , and the opportunistic pathogens , C. glabrata , C. krusei , C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis , isolated from human tissue samples also enhanced P10145 secretion by Caco-2 cells .
