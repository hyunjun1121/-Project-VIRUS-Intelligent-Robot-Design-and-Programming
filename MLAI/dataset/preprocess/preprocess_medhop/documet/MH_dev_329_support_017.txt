Altered transcriptional regulators in response to serum in immortalized lymphocytes from Alzheimer 's disease patients . Cell cycle disturbances may precede neuronal death in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . We described alterations , in lymphocytes from AD patients , on the activity of two transcription factors , E2F and NF-kappaB , involved in cell proliferation and survival regulation , demonstrating that cell cycle dysfunction also occurs in peripheral cells . The analysis of E2F-DNA binding activity revealed lower signal intensity of protein-DNA complexes in AD cells , which correlated with increased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) related proteins and enhanced proliferation . The calmodulin ( P62158 ) antagonist calmidazolium ( DB01489 ) abrogated the increased activity of AD cells by partially dephosphorylating P06400 and Q08999 . The NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity increased as cell progress through the cell cycle . The reduced NF-kappaB activation observed in AD cells appears not to be related to the increased phosphorylation of the P06400 family proteins nor with the enhanced proliferative activity of AD cells , but seems to protect them from death induced by the loss of trophic support . Ca2+/ P62158 antagonists rescue NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity and sensitize AD cells to serum withdrawal . These observations suggest that disruption of Ca2+/ P62158 signaling pathway could be linked mechanistically to its pro cell survival actions , promoting enhanced proliferation or decreased cell death depending on the presence of growth-stimulatory signals .
