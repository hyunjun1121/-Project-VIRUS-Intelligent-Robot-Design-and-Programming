Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract : targeted next-generation sequencing suggests a monoclonal origin of the two components . BACKGROUND : Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas ( MANECs ) of the gastrointestinal tract are rare neoplasms characterized by coexisting exocrine and neuroendocrine neoplastic components . MANECs ' histogenetic classification and molecular characterization remain unclear , significantly affecting the identification of innovative therapeutic options for these tumors . METHODS : The exocrine and neuroendocrine components of 6 gastrointestinal MANECs were microdissected and subjected to the simultaneous mutation assessment in selected regions of 54 cancer-associated genes using Ion Torrent semiconductor-based next-generation sequencing . Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry were used as validation of the mutational status . RESULTS : A total of 20 driver gene somatic mutations were observed among the 12 neoplastic components investigated . In 11 of 12 ( 91.7 % ) samples , at least one mutation was detected ; 7 samples ( 58.3 % ) were found to have multiple mutations . P04637 gene mutations were the most frequent genetic alterations observed in the series , occurring in 11/12 samples ( 91.7 % ) . Somatic mutations in other genes were detected at lower frequencies : Q13315 , P35222 , Q15303 , P52333 , P35968 , P01116 , P06400 . CONCLUSIONS : Five of the 6 MANECs presented an overlapping mutational profile in both components , suggesting a monoclonal origin of the two MANEC components .
