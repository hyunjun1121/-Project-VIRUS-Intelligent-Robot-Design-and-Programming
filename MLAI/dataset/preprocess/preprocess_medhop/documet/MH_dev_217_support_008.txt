[ In vitro comparison of podophyllotoxin analogues ; etoposide , teniposide and NK 611 using human lung cancer cell lines ] . In an attempt to predict the antitumor activity of a new podophyllotoxin analogue , NK 611 , in the treatment of lung cancer , we compared the drug with etoposide and teniposide using four human small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cell lines , SBC-2 , -3 , -4 , -7 , and two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines , O95477 , EBC-1 . In terms of the fifty percent tumor growth inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) determined by MTT assay , teniposide was most potent among the drugs . The degree of cross-resistance of each drug was investigated using an etoposide-resistant SCLC subline ( SBC-3/ DB00609 ) , an adriamycin-resistant subline ( SBC-3/ P35318 100 ) , and a cisplatin-resistant subline ( SBC-3/ DB00515 ) . As for relative resistant ( the ratio of IC 50 for resistant subline to that for the parent subline ) , NK 611 was least cross-resistant to etoposide , adriamycin , and cisplatin among drugs tested . These results indicate that NK 611 may play a role in a salvage chemotherapy for patients with resistant SCLC .
