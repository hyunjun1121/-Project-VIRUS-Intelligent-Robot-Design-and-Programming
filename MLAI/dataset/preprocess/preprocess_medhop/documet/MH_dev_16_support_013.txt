Combination therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma : additive preclinical efficacy of the HDAC inhibitor DB06603 with sorafenib . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a heterogeneous cancer in which sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy . Histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) are commonly dysregulated in cancer and therefore represent promising targets for therapies , however their role in HCC pathogenesis is still unknown . We analyzed the expression of 11 HDACs in human HCCs and assessed the efficacy of the pan-HDAC inhibitor DB06603 alone and in combination with sorafenib in preclinical models of liver cancer . METHODS : Gene expression and copy number changes were analyzed in a cohort of 334 human HCCs , while the effects of DB06603 and sorafenib were evaluated in three liver cancer cell lines and a murine xenograft model . RESULTS : Aberrant HDAC expression was identified and validated in 91 and 243 HCCs , respectively . Upregulation of O15379 and Q9UQL6 mRNAs was significantly correlated with DNA copy number gains . Inhibiting HDACs with DB06603 led to strong anti-tumoral effects in vitro and vivo , enhanced by the addition of sorafenib . Cell viability and proliferation declined , while apoptosis and autophagy increased . DB06603 increased histone H3 and HSP90 acetylation , downregulated O15392 ( survivin ) and upregulated CDH1 . Combination therapy with DB06603 and sorafenib significantly decreased vessel density , and most significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival in HCC xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : Aberrant expression of several HDACs and copy number gains of O15379 and Q9UQL6 occur in HCC . Treatment with DB06603 combined with sorafenib demonstrated the highest preclinical efficacy in HCC models , providing the rationale for clinical studies with this novel combination .
