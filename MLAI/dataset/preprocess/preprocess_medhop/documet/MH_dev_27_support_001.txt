Anti-thrombin therapy during warm ischemia and cold preservation prevents chronic kidney graft fibrosis in a P81605 model . Ischemia reperfusion injury ( IRI ) is pivotal for renal fibrosis development via peritubular capillaries injury . Coagulation represents a key mechanism involved in this process . Melagatran ( M ) , a thrombin inhibitor , was evaluated in an autotransplanted kidney model , using Large White pigs . To mimic deceased after cardiac death donor conditions , kidneys underwent warm ischemia ( WI ) for 60 min before cold preservation for 24 h in University of Wisconsin solution . Treatment with M before WI and/or in the preservation solution drastically improved survival at 3 months , reduced renal dysfunction related to a critical reduction in interstitial fibrosis , measured by Sirius Red staining . Tissue analysis revealed reduced expression of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) and activation level of its effectors phospho- P84022 , Q13485 and connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ) after M treatment . Fibrinolysis activation was also observed , evidenced by downregulation of P05121 protein and gene expression . In addition , M reduced P26447 expression and vimentin staining , which are markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition , a major pathway to chronic kidney fibrosis . Finally , expression of oxidative stress markers Nox2 and P35228 was reduced . We conclude that inhibition of thrombin is an effective therapy against IRI that reduces chronic graft fibrosis , with a significantly positive effect on survival .
