Discrimination between agonists and antagonists by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid-selective glutamate receptor . A mutation analysis of the ligand-binding domain of P48058 subunit . The crystal structures of the ligand-binding core of the agonist complexes of the glutamate receptor-B ( P42262 ) subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid ( AMPA ) -selective glutamate receptor indicate that the distal anionic group of agonist molecules are stabilized by interactions with an N-terminal region of an alpha-helix ( helix F ) in the lobe 2 ( " domain 2 , " Armstrong , N. , and Gouaux , E. ( 2000 ) Neuron 28 , 165-181 ) of the two-lobed ligand-binding domain . We used site-directed mutagenesis to further analyze the role of this region in the recognition of both agonists and antagonists by the AMPA receptor . Wild-type and mutated versions of the ligand-binding domain of P48058 were expressed in insect cells as secreted soluble polypeptides and subjected to binding assays using [(3)H]AMPA , an agonist , and [(3)H]Ro 48-8587 ( 9-imidazol-1-yl-8-nitro-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c] quinazoline-2,5-dione ) , a high affinity AMPA receptor antagonist , as radioligands . Single alanine substitutions at residues DB00149 -672 and DB00156 -677 severely affected the affinities for all agonists , as seen in ligand competition assays , whereas similar mutations at residues DB00128 -673 , DB00133 -674 , DB00145 -675 , DB00133 -676 , and Lys-678 selectively affected the binding affinities of one or two of the agonists . In striking contrast , the binding affinities of [(3)H]Ro 48-8587 and of another competitive antagonist , DB03759 , were not affected by any of these alanine mutations , suggesting the absence of critical side-chain interactions . Together with ligand docking experiments , our results indicate a selective engagement of the side chains of the helix F region in agonist binding , and suggest that conformational changes involving this region may play a critical role in receptor activation .
