Immunohistochemical study of P15692 , angiopoietin 2 and their receptors in the neovascularization following microinjection of P13671 glioma cells into rat brain . BACKGROUND : Recent papers suggest that two angiogenic factors ( angiopoietin 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor ) cooperate in tumoral angiogenesis to support the growing tumor . The purpose of the present work was to demonstrate the existence of such cooperation in a longitudinal study of a brain tumor model during tumor growth by means of immunohistochemistry . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study was performed on 31 rats bearing P13671 glioma . At different stages of tumor growth , the histological aspects were described and sections were immunostained for P15692 , Ang-2 and their receptors P17948 , P35968 and Tie-2 . Immunostaining was semi-quantitatively analyzed and the localization of immunostained cells was reported . RESULTS : Ang-2 and Tie-2 were detected in the endothelial cells of vessels surrounded by tumor cells , occuring early in our study , with immunostaining taking place from day 4 to day 24 . Immunostaining with P15692 ( on tumoral cells ) and P35968 ( on endothelial cells ) was present after 8 days of tumor growth . A clear increase of vessel density can be observed at the periphery of the tumors after 16 days of tumor growth . At that time , areas of necrosis were present in the tumor with concomitant P15692 and Ang-2 expression . CONCLUSION : The present study demonstrated cooperation between the early effect of Ang-2 and the secondary effect of P15692 to elaborate new vessels in a longitudinal study of experimental brain tumors . This study is favorable to the new model of tumor angiogenesis , with successive vessel cooption , regression and growth mediated by angiopoietins and P15692 .
