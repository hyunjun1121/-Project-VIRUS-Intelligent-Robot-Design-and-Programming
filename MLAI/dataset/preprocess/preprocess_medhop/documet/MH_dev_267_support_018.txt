Discovery of DB05130 , a Potent , Selective , and Orally Bioavailable hCCR2 Antagonist . We report the identification of 13 ( DB05130 ) as a potent human P41597 ( hCCR2 ) antagonist . DB05130 exhibited an IC50 of 3.7 nM in antagonism of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 binding to hCCR2 , an IC50 of 4.7 nM in antagonism of chemotaxis activity , an IC50 of 84 Î¼M in inhibition of the hERG potassium current , a free fraction of 58 % in protein binding , high selectivity over other chemokine receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors , and acceptable oral bioavailability in rodents and primates . In human clinical trials , DB05130 exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once-a-day dosing ( T 1/2 = 15 h ) .
