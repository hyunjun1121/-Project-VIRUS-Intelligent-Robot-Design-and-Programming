Maximizing clinical benefit with trastuzumab . To optimize patient management in breast cancer a number of factors are considered , including hormone receptor and P04626 status . A feasible approach for women with less aggressive , estrogen receptor/ P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer is to consider trastuzumab ( Herceptin ; F. Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) combined with endocrine therapy . Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to assess the combination of trastuzumab with aromatase inhibitors . In patients with aggressive P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer , trastuzumab/chemotherapy combination regimens are warranted . When administered first line in combination with a taxane , trastuzumab improves all clinical outcome parameters , including survival , in such patients . DB00072 adds little to the toxicity profile of taxanes , and trastuzumab combination therapy is associated with improvements in quality of life when compared with chemotherapy alone . There is encouraging evidence of improved efficacy when trastuzumab is combined with other cytotoxic agents with proven single-agent activity in breast cancer , including capecitabine ( DB01101 ; F. Hoffmann-La Roche ) , gemcitabine , and vinorelbine . DB00072 is also being investigated as part of triplet drug regimens . DB00072 has good single-agent activity in first-line therapy . This is of relevance to women with P04626 -positive disease who are not suitable for , or do not wish to receive , cytotoxic chemotherapy . The benefits noted with trastuzumab-containing regimens were documented in clinical trials where trastuzumab was given until disease progression . A further rationale exists to continue trastuzumab beyond progression . Data from retrospective reviews indicate that this strategy is feasible .
