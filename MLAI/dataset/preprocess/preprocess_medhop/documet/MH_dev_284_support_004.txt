Expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor , P04035 , and multidrug resistance ( Mdr1 ) genes in colorectal carcinomas . Some malignant cells have elevated uptake of plasma low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . We determined the expressions in colorectal cancers of the P01130 gene , of the gene for the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , and of the multidrug resistance gene ( mdr1 ) by quantitative RNA-RNA solution hybridisation . P01130 RNA levels in tumor tissue exceeded those in normal mucosa in 20 of 23 patients ( 2-11-fold higher in 17 of 23 patients ) , with a mean +/- SD of 7.8 +/- 5.8 copies/cell in tumor tissue vs 3.5 +/- 2.5 in normal mucosa ( P = 0.002 ) . The P04035 gene was similarly expressed in tumor and normal tissue , with means and SD of 2.0 +/- 1.3 copies/cell versus 2.2 +/- 1.9 ( pi = 21 ) . Mdr1 RNA was undetectable ( < 0.15 copies/cell ) in 5 of 20 tumors , with a mean +/- SD of 1.0 +/- 1.1 copies/cell vs 1.6 +/- 1.7 in normal mucosa . Expression of all three genes was , in most cases , higher in normal liver than in liver metastasis of colorectal carcinomas or normal colon mucosa . The results may form the basis for using LDL as a drug carrier for treatment of colorectal carcinomas , and may indicate that drug resistance in these tumors is not due to overexpression of the mdr1 gene .
