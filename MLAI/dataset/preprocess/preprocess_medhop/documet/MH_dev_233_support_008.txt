DB00072 has preferential activity against breast cancers driven by P04626 homodimers . In breast cancer cells with P04626 gene amplification , P04626 receptors exist on the cell surface as monomers , homodimers , and heterodimers with P00533 / P21860 . The therapeutic antibody trastuzumab , an approved therapy for P04626 (+) breast cancer , can not block ligand-induced P04626 heterodimers , suggesting it can not effectively inhibit P04626 signaling . Hence , P04626 oligomeric states may predict the odds of a clinical response to trastuzumab in P04626 -driven tumors . To test this hypothesis , we generated nontransformed human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells stably expressing a chimeric P04626 -FKBP molecule that could be conditionally induced to homodimerize by adding the FKBP ligand AP1510 , or instead induced to heterodimerize with P00533 or P21860 by adding the heterodimer ligands P01133 /TGFα or heregulin . AP1510 , P01133 , and heregulin each induced growth of MCF10A cells expressing P04626 -FKBP . DB00072 inhibited homodimer-mediated but not heterodimer-mediated cell growth . In contrast , the P04626 antibody pertuzumab , which blocks P04626 heterodimerization , inhibited growth induced by heregulin but not AP1510 . Lastly , the P04626 / P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib blocked both homodimer- and heterodimer-induced growth . AP1510 triggered phosphorylation of Erk1/2 but not AKT , whereas trastuzumab inhibited AP1510-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation and Shc- P04626 homodimer binding , but not TGFα-induced AKT phosphorylation . Consistent with these observations , high levels of P04626 homodimers correlated with longer time to progression following trastuzumab therapy in a cohort of patients with P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer . Together , our findings confirm the notion that P04626 oligomeric states regulate P04626 signaling , also arguing that trastuzumab sensitivity of homodimers may reflect their inability to activate the PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase ) /AKT pathway . A clinical implication of our results is that high levels of P04626 homodimers may predict a positive response to trastuzumab .
