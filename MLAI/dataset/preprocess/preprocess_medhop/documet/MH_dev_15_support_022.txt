ShRNA silencing glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer . P49841 ( GSK-3β ) , a serine/threonine protein kinase , plays a vital role in the tumorigenesis of many cancers , but its role in pancreatic cancer remains unknown . In this study , we showed that GSK-3β was aberrantly activated in pancreatic cancer . GSK-3β knockdown resulted in arrested proliferation and increased apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines . Expression of Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) decreased significantly in a GSK-3β knockdown group . In a xenograft tumor model , GSK-3β knockdown inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis . Our study showed that GSK-3β may become a promising therapeutic target for human pancreatic cancer .
