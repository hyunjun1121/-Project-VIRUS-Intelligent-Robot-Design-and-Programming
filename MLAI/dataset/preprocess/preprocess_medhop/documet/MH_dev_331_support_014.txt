Inhibition of human brain and RBC acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) by heptylphysostigmine ( HPTL ) . Heptylphysostigmine ( HPTL ) , a derivative of the P22303 inhibitor physostigmine ( PHY ) , is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer 's disease . HPTL is active against human RBC P22303 both in vitro and in vivo . Activity of HPTL against human brain has not been documented . We have developed an in vitro assay system using particulate membrane fractions which permits comparison of inhibition and recovery kinetics of human RBC ( primarily globular dimer ) and brain ( primarily globular tetramer ) membrane-bound forms . Under these conditions the HPTLIC50 is similar for the two forms . RBC P22303 inhibition spontaneously reverses in 24 h , as occurs in vivo . In striking contrast , activity of inhibited brain enzyme does not recover on overnight incubation . DDVP-induced inhibition , but not HPTL inhibition , can be reversed by the oxime DB00733 . Some recovery of HPTL inhibition , but not to the level seen with RBC P22303 , occurs on addition of heat-stable fractions from serum or P04141 . Brain enzyme recovers rapidly from PHY in this system . Responses of brain and RBC P22303 to HPTL indicate that these forms are functionally as well as structurally distinct . Since brain inhibition apparently does not spontaneously reverse like RBC inhibition , peripheral measurements of patient responses should be assessed with caution during treatment with HPTL .
