DB08818 and cell locomotion . DB08818 ( HA ) , a glycosaminoglycan , has long been implicated in cell locomotion . We have shown that HA production regulates the locomotion of H-ras-transformed cells . This autocrine motility mechanism is mediated by a novel HA receptor termed O75330 , an acronym for Receptor for HA Mediated Motility . HA: O75330 interactions regulate directional locomotion of tumor cells and result in enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation that may be a critical messenger mechanism for initiation of locomotion .
