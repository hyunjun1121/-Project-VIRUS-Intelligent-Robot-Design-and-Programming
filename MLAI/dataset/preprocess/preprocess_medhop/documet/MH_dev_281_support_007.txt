Interaction between serotonin 5- Q13049 receptor gene and dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) gene polymorphisms influences personality trait of persistence in Austrian Caucasians . We examined 89 normal volunteers using Cloninger 's Temperament and Character Inventory ( TCI ) . Genotyping the 102T/C polymorphism of the serotonin 5HT2A receptor gene and the ser9gly polymorphism in exon 1 of the dopamine D3 receptor ( P35462 ) gene was performed using PCR-RFLP , whereas the dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) gene variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR ) polymorphism was investigated using PCR amplification followed by electrophoresis in an 8 % acrylamide gel with a set of size markers . We found a nominally significant association between gender and harm avoidance ( P=0.017 ; women showing higher scores ) . There was no association of either Q01959 , P35462 or 5HT2A alleles or genotypes with any dimension of the TCI applying Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests . Comparing homozygote and heterozygote Q01959 genotypes , we found higher novelty seeking scores in homozygotes ( P=0.054 ) . We further found a nominally significant interaction between Q01959 and 5HT2A homo-/heterozygous gene variants ( P=0.0071 ; Q01959 and 5HT2A genotypes P value of 0.05 ) , performing multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . Examining the temperamental TCI subscales , this interaction was associated with persistence ( genotypes : P=0.004 ; homo-/heterozygous gene variants : P=0.0004 ) . We conclude that an interaction between Q01959 and 5HT2A genes might influence the temperamental personality trait persistence .
