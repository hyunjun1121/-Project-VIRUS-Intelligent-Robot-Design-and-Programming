Novel camptothecin analogues that circumvent Q9UNQ0 -associated drug resistance in human tumor cells . DB00762 ( 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin ; CPT-11 ) is a widely used potent antitumor drug that inhibits mammalian P11387 ( Topo I ) ; however , overexpression of Q9UNQ0 ( Q9UNQ0 / Q9UNQ0 / Q9UNQ0 ) can confer cancer cell resistance to SN-38 , the active form of CPT-11 . We have recently demonstrated that plasma membrane vesicles prepared from Q9UNQ0 -overexpressing PC-6/ Q8WUX1 -5H cells transported SN-38 and its glucuronide conjugate in an DB00171 -dependent manner ( Nakatomi et al. , Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2001;288:827-32 ) . In the present study , we have characterized a total of 14 new camptothecin ( CPT ) analogues with respect to both the inhibition of Topo I and the substrate specificity of Q9UNQ0 . All of the tested CPT analogues , which have different substitutions at positions 10 and 11 , strongly inhibited the Topo I activity in a cell-free system , as did SN-38 . Their antitumor activities in the SN-38-resistant PC-6/ Q8WUX1 -5H2 cell line greatly varied , however , being correlated with intracellular accumulation levels . We have examined DB00171 -dependent transport of those CPT analogues by using plasma membrane vesicles prepared from both PC-6/ Q8WUX1 -5H2 cells and Q9UNQ0 -transfected P29320 -293 cells . Based on the substrate specificity of Q9UNQ0 thus evaluated , it is strongly suggested that CPT analogues with high polarity are good substrates for Q9UNQ0 and are therefore effectively extruded from cancer cells . In this context , to circumvent Q9UNQ0 -associated drug resistance , low-polarity CPT analogues are considered to be potent lead compounds . The present study provides a practical approach to discover new CPT-based drugs for the chemotherapy of drug-resistant human cancer .
