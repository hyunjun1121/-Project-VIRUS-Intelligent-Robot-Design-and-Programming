The cytotoxic effect of β-elemene against malignant glioma is enhanced by base-excision repair inhibitor methoxyamine . This study investigated the effects of β-elemene + methoxyamine , a DNA base-excision repair inhibitor , on the inhibition of glioma growth . We treated P13671 and SHG44 glioma cells with β-elemene and methoxyamine individually or in combinations , and subsequently analyzed cellular survivals by MTT assay . Comet assay , γ- P16104 focus formation assay and Western-blot were performed to investigate whether the observed cytotoxicity was associates with DNA damages . Finally , a xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice with P13671 cells to analyze in vivo tumor inhibition effects of β-elemene , which was followed by determination of the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 via immunohistochemistry staining . Results showed that β-elemene could significantly inhibit the growth of glioma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The combination of methoxyamine with β-elemene could result in a greater extent of DNA injuries in vitro . Furthermore , in vivo tumors exhibited a marked shrinkage in volume in β-elemene + methoxyamine treatment group . Immunohistochemistry analysis of the tumor tissues showed a distinctive decrease in Bcl-2 staining in β-elemene ( 56 % ) and β-elemene + methoxyamine ( 36 % ) groups when compared with the negative control ( 77 % ) . In conclusion , β-elemene exhibits a significant cytotoxic effect against glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo , which is likely to be mediated by its potential to damage tumor cell DNA and activate apoptotic pathway . Such growth inhibition effect of β-elemene could be potentiated by methoxyamine co-administration . Therefore , a combination of the two agents as a novel chemotherapeutic option for glioma merits further investigations .
