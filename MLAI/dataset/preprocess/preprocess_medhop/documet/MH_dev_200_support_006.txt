The anti- P33681 primatized monoclonal antibody , galiximab , is well-tolerated but has limited activity in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma : Cancer and Leukemia Group B 50602 ( Alliance ) . Relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma remains a clinical challenge , with few non-cytotoxic treatment options . P33681 is a surface antigen that normally functions as a co-stimulatory molecule but is aberrantly and uniformly expressed on Reed-Sternberg cells . DB04901 is a primatized monoclonal antibody against P33681 , with a favorable toxicity profile demonstrated in other lymphomas . Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) 50602 ( Alliance ) tested single-agent galiximab in a highly refractory group of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma ( median 3 prior regimens , 83 % failing after prior stem cell transplant ) to determine the efficacy . The overall response rate was 10.3 % and the median progression-free survival was 1.6 months . DB04901 was well-tolerated , with minimal grade 3 or 4 toxicities . Despite this preclinical rationale , single-agent galiximab had limited activity in heavily pretreated Hodgkin lymphoma .
