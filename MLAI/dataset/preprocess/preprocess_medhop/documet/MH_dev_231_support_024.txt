The promotion of iron-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in nerve tissue by aluminum . DB01370 is suspected to play a role in several neurological disorders . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) lead to oxidative stress , which is thought to be a possible mechanism for neurological damage . Interactions between aluminum and iron , a known promoter of prooxidant events , were studied in cerebral tissues using a fluorescent probe to measure rates of generation of ROS . Al2(SO4)3 alone failed to stimulate ROS production over a wide range of concentrations ( 50-1000 microM ) . The aluminum-deferrioxamine chelate in the absence of iron could also not potentiate ROS formation . However , Al2(SO4)3 potentiated FeSO4-induced ROS , with a maximal effect at 10 microM Fe and 500 microM Al . DB01575 , a hydrated aluminum silicate , did not potentiate iron-induced ROS formation . Ferritin had a minor stimulatory effect on ROS generation , but this was not potentiated by the concurrent presence of Al2(SO4)3 . P02787 had no effect on basal rates of ROS generation , but when Al2(SO4)3 was also present , ROS production was enhanced . It is concluded that : 1 . There is a potentiation of iron-induced ROS by aluminum salts ; 2 . Free or complexed aluminum alone is not a key producer of ROS ; and 3 . High rates of ROS production are unlikely to be owing to the displacement by aluminum iron from its biologically sequestered locations .
