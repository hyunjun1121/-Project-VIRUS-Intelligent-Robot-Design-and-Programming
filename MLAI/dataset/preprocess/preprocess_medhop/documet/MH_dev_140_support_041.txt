Rationalizing cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibition for maximal efficacy and minimal adverse events . New information indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) is constitutively expressed in several tissues , including brain , lung , pancreas , kidney , and ovary , and plays an important role in renal and gastrointestinal function . Selective P35354 inhibition has been associated in animal studies with impairment of ulcer healing and renal function and inhibition of prostacyclin , an effect that inhibits vasodilation without inhibiting platelet aggregation . The clinical consequences , if any , of these effects remain to be determined in long-term studies in humans . The premise that selective P35354 inhibitors will cause less gastrointestinal toxicity than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that inhibit both P36551 isoforms needs to take into account the low toxicity of nabumetone . The gastrointestinal safety profile of this nonacidic , dual P36551 inhibitor that does not undergo enterohepatic circulation has been evaluated in extensive clinical trials . The data submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration in the New Drug Application for nabumetone ( DB00461 ) , the comparative trials subsequently completed , the published databases of the comparative gastrointestinal toxicity of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and the meta-analysis published in this issue of The American Journal of Medicine ( Schoenfeld , page 48S ) indicate that nabumetone has the lowest incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity among the extensively studied NSAIDs . Overall , the incidence is approximately 10-fold less than with comparator drugs . This rate is an appropriate current reference against which the gastrointestinal toxicity of P35354 inhibitors can be compared .
