Characterization of plant P18887 and its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen . In plants , there are no P06746 ( Pol beta ) and P49916 ( Lig3 ) genes . Thus , the plant short-patch base excision repair ( short-patch BER ) pathway must differ considerably from that in mammals . We characterized the rice ( Oryza Sativa L. cv. Nipponbare ) homologue of the mammalian X-ray repair cross complementing 1 ( P18887 ) , a well-known BER protein . The plant P18887 lacks the N-terminal domain ( NTD ) which is required for Pol beta binding and is essential for mammalian cell survival . The recombinant rice P18887 ( OsXRCC1 ) protein binds single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) as well as double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) and also interacts with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( OsPCNA ) in a pull-down assay . Through immunoprecipitation , we demonstrated that OsXRCC1 forms a complex with P12004 in vivo . OsXRCC1 mRNA was expressed in all rice organs and was induced by application of bleomycin , but not of MMS , H(2)O(2) or UV-B . DB00290 also increased the fraction of OsXRCC1 associated with chromatin . These results suggest that OsXRCC1 contributes to DNA repair pathways that differ from the mammalian BER system .
