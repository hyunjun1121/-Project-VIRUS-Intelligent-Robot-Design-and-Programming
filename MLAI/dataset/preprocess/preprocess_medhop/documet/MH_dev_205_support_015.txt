Rare allelic variants determine folate status in an unsupplemented European population . The role of folates as coenzymes in 1-carbon metabolism and the clinical consequences of disturbed folate metabolism are widely known . DB00158 status is a complex trait determined by both exogenous and endogenous factors . This study analyzed the association between 12 genetic variants and folate status in a Czech population with no folate fortification program . These 12 genetic variants were selected from 56 variant alleles found by resequencing the coding sequences and adjacent intronic regions of 6 candidate genes involved in folate metabolism or transport ( P15328 , P14207 , P41439 , P42898 , Q96NT5 , and P41440 ) from 29 individuals with low plasma and erythrocyte folate concentrations . Regression analyses of a cohort of 511 Czech controls not taking folate supplements revealed that only 2 variants in the P42898 gene were associated with altered folate concentrations in plasma and/or erythrocytes . In our previous study , we observed that the common variant P42898 c.665C > T ( known as c.677C > T ; p.A222V ) was associated with decreased plasma folate concentrations . In the present study , we show in addition that the rare variant P42898 c.1958C > T ( p.T653M ) is associated with significantly increased erythrocyte folate concentrations ( P = 0.02 ) . Multivariate regression analysis revealed that this uncommon variant , which is present in 2 % of Czech control chromosomes , explains 0.9 % of the total variability of erythrocyte folate concentrations ; the magnitude of this effect size was comparable with that of the common P42898 c.665C > T variant . This result indicates that the rare genetic variants may determine folate status to a similar extent as the common allelic variant .
