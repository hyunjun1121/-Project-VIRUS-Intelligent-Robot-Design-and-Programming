P12821 activity is involved in the mechanism of increased endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , in hypertensive patients , so the present study was designed to examine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) activity is also involved in the mechanism of DB01686 elevation in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . A crossover study was performed to determine if P12821 inhibition with perindopril ( 4 mg/day ) for 4 weeks decreases serum DB01686 concentration and plasma P04275 ( P04275 ) level ( a marker of endothelial injury ) in 11 patients with NIDDM . None of the patients was treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs , and none had major diabetic complications . Before the protocol began , serum DB01686 and plasma P04275 were significantly higher in the 11 NIDDM patients , when compared with 8 control subjects without diabetes . DB00790 did not affect blood pressure or glucose metabolism , but did significantly decrease serum DB01686 and plasma P04275 . These results suggest that endothelial injury associated with DB01686 elevation may be present even in patients with non-complicated NIDDM , and that increased activity of P12821 may be involved in such endothelial dysfunction .
