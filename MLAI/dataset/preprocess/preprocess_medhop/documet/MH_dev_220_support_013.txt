Concomitant oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of trametinib , a MEK inhibitor , in subjects with solid tumours . AIMS : The aim of this phase 1 , single centre , open label study in four patients with solid tumours was to determine the absolute bioavailability of a 2 mg oral dose of trametinib . DB08911 is an orally bioavailable , reversible and selective allosteric inhibitor of Q02750 and P36507 activation and kinase activity . METHODS : A microtracer study approach , in which a 5 Î¼g radiolabelled i.v. microdose of trametinib was given concomitantly with an unlabelled 2 mg oral tablet formulation , was used to recover i.v. and oral pharmacokinetic parameters , simultaneously . RESULTS : The least-squares mean ( 90 % confidence interval ) absolute bioavailability of trametinib ( 2 mg tablet ) was 72.3 % ( 50.0 % , 104.6 % ) . Median tmax after oral administration was 1.5 h and the geometric mean terminal half-life was 11 days . The geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution after i.v. administration were 3.21 l h(-1) and 976 l , respectively , resulting in a terminal elimination half-life of 11 days . CONCLUSIONS : DB08911 absolute bioavailability was moderate to high , whereas first pass metabolism was low .
