Activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway is necessary for desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor-stimulated phospholipase C signalling by olanzapine , clozapine and MDL 100907 . We have previously demonstrated that olanzapine-induced desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor-stimulated phospholipase C ( P98160 ) activity is associated with increases in P49802 protein levels both in vivo and in cells in culture , and the increase in P49802 is dependent on activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway in cells in culture . In the present study , we found that desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor-stimulated P98160 activity induced by olanzapine is dependent on activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway . Similar to olanzapine , clozapine-induced desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor signalling is accompanied by increases in P49802 and activation of O60674 . Treatment with the selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist MDL 100907 also increased P49802 protein levels and O60674 activation . Using a O60674 inhibitor AG490 , we found that clozapine and MDL 100907-induced increases in P49802 are dependent on activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway . Olanzapine , clozapine , and MDL 100907 treatment increased mRNA levels of P49802 . Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we found P40763 binding to the putative P49802 promoter region . Taken together , olanzapine-induced activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway , and P40763 binding to the P49802 gene could underlie the increase in P49802 mRNA which could subsequently increase protein expression . Furthermore , the increase in P49802 protein could play a role in the desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor signalling by terminating the activated Galphaq/11 proteins more rapidly . Overall , our data suggest that the complete desensitization of 5- Q13049 receptor-stimulated P98160 activity by olanzapine , clozapine and MDL 100907 requires activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway , which in turn increases P49802 expression probably by direct transcriptional activity of P40763 .
