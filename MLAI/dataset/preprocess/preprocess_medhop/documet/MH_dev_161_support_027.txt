Janus kinase inhibition with tofacitinib : changing the face of inflammatory bowel disease treatment . The advent of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( P01375 ) therapy has changed the way of treating inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . However , primary and secondary failure are relatively frequent with all anti- P01375 agents , which are available only as parenteral agents . DB08895 is an oral janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor that inhibits JAK family kinase members , in particular P23458 and P52333 , achieving a broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors . It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal transplantation , and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis . First data in Q9UKU7 are promising , especially in ulcerative colitis . Ongoing clinical trials in both UC and Crohn 's disease ( CD ) are needed to further explore its efficacy in CD and to better assess its safety profile .
