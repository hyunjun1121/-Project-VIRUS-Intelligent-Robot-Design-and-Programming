Activation of PPARgamma by rosiglitazone attenuates intestinal Cl- secretion . The thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) drugs rosiglitazone ( Ro ) and pioglitazone ( Po ) are PPARgamma agonists in widespread clinical use as insulin-sensitizing agents in Type 2 diabetes . On the basis of recent evidence implicating PPARgamma as a positive modulator of intestinal epithelial differentiation , we hypothesized that TZD drugs might attenuate intestinal secretory function . To evaluate this possibility , we examined the effects of Ro and Po on electrogenic Cl- secretion [ short-circuit current ( I(sc) ) ] in mouse intestinal segments and in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells ( HT29-Cl.19A ) . As hypothesized , oral administration of Ro ( 20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) ) to mice for 8 days markedly reduced intestinal I(sc) responses to DB02527 (forskolin)- and Ca2+ (carbachol)-dependent stimuli . In these Ro-treated mice , cholera toxin-induced intestinal fluid accumulation was reduced 65 % . With continued Ro treatment , the I(sc) response to carbachol recovered significantly , whereas that to forskolin remained attenuated . Treatment of HT29 cells for 5 days with 10 muM Ro or Po in vitro brought about a similar hyposecretory state . In HT29 cells , the loss of DB02527 -dependent Cl- secretion was attributable to a reduced expression of P13569 Cl- channel , P51787 K+ channel , and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 proteins . The transient loss of Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion involved an impairment of basolateral Ca2+-stimulated K+ channel activity without a detectable loss of K(Ca)3.1 channel protein . Our results establish TZD drugs as important modulators of intestinal Cl- secretory function .
