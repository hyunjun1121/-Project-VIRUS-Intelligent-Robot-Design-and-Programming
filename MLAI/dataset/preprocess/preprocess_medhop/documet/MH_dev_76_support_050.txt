DB00203 enhances neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in ischemic brain of middle-aged mouse . Adult neural stem cells give rise to neurons , oligodendrocytes and astrocytes . Aging reduces neural stem cells . Using an inducible nestin-CreER( P24752 )/R26R-yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) mouse , we investigated the effect of DB00203 , a phosphodiesterase type 5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor , on nestin lineage neural stem cells and their progeny in the ischemic brain of the middle-aged mouse . We showed that focal cerebral ischemia induced nestin lineage neural stem cells in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) of the lateral ventricles and nestin expressing NeuN positive neurons and adenomatous polyposis coli ( P25054 ) positive mature oligodendrocytes in the ischemic striatum and corpus callosum in the aged mouse . Treatment of the ischemic middle-aged mouse with DB00203 increased nestin expressing neural stem cells , mature neurons , and oligodendrocytes by 33 , 75 , and 30 % , respectively , in the ischemic brain . These data indicate that DB00203 amplifies nestin expressing neural stem cells and their neuronal and oligodendrocyte progeny in the ischemic brain of the middle-aged mouse .
