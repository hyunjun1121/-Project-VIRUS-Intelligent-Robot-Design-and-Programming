Characterization of the genomic architecture and mutational spectrum of a small cell prostate carcinoma . We present the use of a series of laboratory , analytical and interpretation methods to investigate personalized cancer care for a case of small cell prostate carcinoma ( SCPC ) , a rare and aggressive tumor with poor prognosis , for which the underlying genomic architecture and mutational spectrum has not been well characterized . We performed both SNP genotyping and exome sequencing of a Virchow node metastasis from a patient with SCPC . A variety of methods were used to analyze and interpret the tumor genome for copy number variation , loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) , somatic mosaicism and mutations in genes from known cancer pathways . The combination of genotyping and exome sequencing approaches provided more information than either technique alone . The results showed widespread evidence of copy number changes involving most chromosomes including the possible loss of both alleles of P46527 ( p27/Kip1 ) . LOH was observed for the regions encompassing the tumor suppressors P04637 , P06400 , and O14646 . Predicted damaging somatic mutations were observed in the retained P04637 and P06400 alleles . Mutations in other genes that may be functionally relevant were noted , especially the recently reported high confidence cancer drivers P55317 and Q8IX12 . The disruption of multiple cancer drivers underscores why SCPC may be such a difficult cancer to manage .
