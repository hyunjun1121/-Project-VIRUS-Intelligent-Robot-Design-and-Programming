Dissection of the phenotypic and genotypic associations with nicotinic dependence . INTRODUCTION : Strong evidence demonstrates that nicotine dependence is associated with 4 genetic variants rs16969968 , rs6474412 , rs3733829 , and rs1329650 in large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies . We examined how these identified genetic variants relate to nicotine dependence defined by different categorical and dimensional measures . METHODS : Four genetic variants were analyzed in 2,047 subjects of European descent ( 1,062 cases and 985 controls ) . DB00184 dependence was assessed with multiple smoking measures , including the Fagerstr√∂m Test for DB00184 Dependence , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV ( DSM-IV ) nicotine dependence , the DB00184 Dependence Syndrome Scale , and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives . Single-item measures of cigarettes per day ( O75976 ) and time to first cigarette ( Q15669 ) in the morning were also examined . RESULTS : Among the variants , association effect sizes were largest for rs16969968 , with measures of craving and heavy smoking , especially cigarettes smoked per day , showing the largest effects . Significant but weaker associations were found for rs6474412 and rs3733729 but not for rs1329650 . None of the more comprehensive measures of smoking behaviors yielded stronger genetic associations with these variants than did O75976 . CONCLUSIONS : O75976 is an important simple measure that captures in part the genetic associations of P30532 and nicotine dependence , even when other more comprehensive measures of smoking behaviors are examined . The P30532 gene is associated with heavy compulsive smoking and craving ; this should inform the mission to improve the diagnostic validity of DSM-V .
