P00797 angiotensin system modulates P42345 pathway through AT2R in HIVAN . P42345 ( P42345 ) has been reported to contribute to the development of HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) . We hypothesized that HIV may be activating renal tissue P42345 pathway through renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) via Angiotensin Receptor Type II receptor ( AT2R ) . Renal tissues of Vpr transgenic and Tg26 ( HIVAN ) mice displayed enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . DB09026 , a renin inhibitor attenuated phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K in renal tissues of HIVAN mice . Interestingly , Angiotensin Receptor Type I ( AT1R ) blockade did not modulate renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice ; on the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated renal tissue phosphorylation of P42345 in HIVAN mice . In vitro studies , both renin and Ang II displayed enhanced mouse tubular cell ( P04629 ) phosphorylation of p70S6K in a dose dependent manner . HIV/ P04629 also displayed enhanced phosphorylation of both P42345 and p70S6K ; interestingly this effect of HIV was further enhanced by losartan ( an AT1R blocker ) . On the other hand , AT2R blockade attenuated HIV-induced tubular cell phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K , whereas , AT2R agonist enhanced phosphorylation of P42345 and p70S6K . These findings indicate that HIV stimulates P42345 pathway in HIVAN through the activation of renin angiotensin system via AT2R .
