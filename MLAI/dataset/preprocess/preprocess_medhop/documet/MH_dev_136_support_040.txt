Multi-kinase inhibition in ovarian cancer . DB00398 ( Nexavar ) is a multi-kinase inhibitor that was developed as an inhibitor of RAF-1 , in the P27361 /2 pathway , but which was subsequently shown to inhibit class III tyrosine kinase receptors . ( 1 ) More recently regorafenib ( Stivarga ) has been developed , which is a further fluorinated version of sorafenib with greater bioavailability and similar inhibitory properties against RAF-1/class III RTKs . ( 2 ) Some of the anti-tumor effects of sorafenib have been ascribed to anti-angiogenic actions of this agent on endothelial associated kinases such as P35968 . Other effects of sorafenib clearly have to be due to its effects on the inherent biology of the tumor cells themselves . For example , through various mechanisms sorafenib has been shown in the laboratory and the clinic to suppress expression of the protective protein Q8WXI8 -1 . ( 3 ) DB00398 has also been linked to inhibition of P40763 , NFκB , and activation of the death receptor CD95 . ( 4 ) DB00398 is routinely dosed daily ( 400 mg P55957 ) and 7 d after the start of dosing has a Cmax of ~21 μM with a nadir at 12 h of ~10 μM , and is a highly protein bound based on in vitro assays . ( 5 ) Despite this in vitro binding data sorafenib has profound in vivo effects on tumor cells in renal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients ; cells which are not per se addicted to high activity oncogene signals that are targets of sorafenib/regorafenib . Thus the precise stable bioavailable level of sorafenib/regorafenib in patient plasma is not known .
