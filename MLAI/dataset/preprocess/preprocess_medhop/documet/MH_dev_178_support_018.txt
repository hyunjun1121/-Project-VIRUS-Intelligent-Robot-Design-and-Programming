Atrial natriuretic peptide : a possible mediator involved in dexamethasone 's inhibition of cell proliferation in multiple myeloma . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) has been recognized for several decades for its role of regulating blood pressure . Recently , cumulating evidences show that P01160 plays an anticancer role in various solid tumors via blocking the kinase cascade of Ras- Q02750 /2- P27361 /2 with the result of inhibition of DNA synthesis . P01160 , as well as its receptors ( P16066 and P17342 ) has been identified present in the embryonic stem cell and a wide range of cancer cells . Various lymphoid organs , such as lymph nodes , have been detected the presence of P01160 . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , though the therapies have evolved significantly , is still an incurable disease as B lymphocyte cell neoplasm . Dexamethasone is the cornerstone in treatment of MM via inactivation of Ras- Q02750 /2- P27361 /2 cascade reaction . Coincidently , dexamethasone can increase the expression of P01160 markedly . Nevertheless , the role of P01160 in MM is unclear . Based on these results above , we raise the hypothesis that P01160 is involved in mediating dexamethasone 's inhibition of proliferation in MM cells , which suggests that P01160 may be a potential agent to treat MM .
