Targeting botulinum neurotoxin persistence by the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) are the most potent natural toxins known . The effects of BoNT serotype A ( DB00083 ) can last several months , whereas the effects of BoNT serotype E ( BoNT/E ) , which shares the same synaptic target , synaptosomal-associated protein 25 ( P60880 ) , last only several weeks . The long-lasting effects or persistence of DB00083 , although desirable for therapeutic applications , presents a challenge for medical treatment of BoNT intoxication . Although the mechanisms for BoNT toxicity are well known , little is known about the mechanisms that govern the persistence of the toxins . We show that the recombinant catalytic light chain ( LC ) of BoNT/E is ubiquitylated and rapidly degraded in cells . In contrast , DB00083 LC is considerably more stable . Differential susceptibility of the catalytic LCs to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis therefore might explain the differential persistence of BoNT serotypes . In this regard we show that TRAF2 , a RING finger protein implicated in ubiquitylation , selectively associates with BoNT/E LC and promotes its proteasomal degradation . Given these data , we asked whether DB00083 LC could be targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation by redirecting it to characterized ubiquitin ligase domains . We describe chimeric P60880 -based ubiquitin ligases that target DB00083 LC for degradation , reducing its duration in a cellular model for toxin persistence .
