Association of Q05940 gene polymorphisms with alcohol dependence . DB00898 -related diseases cause significant harm in the western world . Up to 65 % of the phenotypic variance is genetically determined . Few candidate genes have been identified , comprising P08319 , P05091 , P21964 , P34998 , Q01959 ( Q01959 ) , P47869 and P21397 . While abnormalities in the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward system are considered important mediators of alcoholism , studies analyzing variants of dopamine receptors showed conflicting results . Other modulators of the reward system are synaptosomal genes . Among candidate genes , polygenic variants of the Vesicular Monamine Transporter 2 ( Q05940 ) gene locus associated with alterations of drinking behavior were published . These variants comprise single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) within the promoter region and the open reading frame . In this study , we confirm the association of Q05940 SNP rs363387 ( allelic association : p = 0.015 ) with alcohol dependence . This SNP defines several haplotypes including up to four SNPs ( minimal p = 0.0045 ) . In addition , numeric effects in the subgroups of males and patients with positive family history were found . We suggest that several rs363387 T-allele containing haplotypes increase the risk of alcohol dependence ( OR 1.53 ) , whereas G-allele containing haplotypes confer protection against alcohol dependence . Taken together , there is supporting evidence for a contribution of Q05940 gene variants to phenotypes of alcohol dependence .
