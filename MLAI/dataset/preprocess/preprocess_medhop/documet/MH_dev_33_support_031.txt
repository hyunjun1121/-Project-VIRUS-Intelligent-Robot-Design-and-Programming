Malignant transformation of P01730 + T lymphocytes mediated by oncogenic kinase P06748 / Q9UM73 recapitulates P60568 -induced cell signaling and gene expression reprogramming . Q9UM73 ( Q9UM73 ) , physiologically expressed only by nervous system cells , displays a remarkable capacity to transform P01730 (+) T lymphocytes and other types of nonneural cells . In this study , we report that activity of nucleophosmin ( P06748 ) / Q9UM73 chimeric protein , the dominant form of Q9UM73 expressed in T cell lymphomas ( TCLs ) , closely resembles cell activation induced by P60568 , the key cytokine supporting growth and survival of normal P01730 (+) T lymphocytes . Direct comparison of gene expression by Q9UM73 (+) Q9H4E5 cells treated with an Q9UM73 inhibitor and P60568 -dependent Q9UM73 (-) Q9H4E5 cells stimulated with the cytokine revealed a very similar , albeit inverse , gene-regulation pattern . Depending on the analysis method , up to 67 % of the affected genes were modulated in common by P06748 / Q9UM73 and P60568 . Based on the gene expression patterns , Jak/ P35610 - and P60568 -signaling pathways topped the list of pathways identified as affected by both P60568 and P06748 / Q9UM73 . The expression dependence on P06748 / Q9UM73 and P60568 of the five selected genes-CD25 ( IL-2RÎ± ) , Egr-1 , Fosl-1 , O14543 , and Irf-4-was confirmed at the protein level . In both Q9UM73 (+) Q9H4E5 and P60568 -stimulated Q9UM73 (-) Q9H4E5 cells , CD25 , O14543 , and Irf-4 genes were activated predominantly by the P42229 and P40763 transcription factors , whereas transcription of Egr-1 and Fosl-1 was induced by the MEK- P29323 pathway . Finally , we found that Egr-1 , a protein not associated previously with either P60568 or Q9UM73 , contributes to the cell proliferation . These findings indicate that P06748 / Q9UM73 transforms the target P01730 (+) T lymphocytes , at least in part , by using the pre-existing , P60568 -dependent signaling pathways .
