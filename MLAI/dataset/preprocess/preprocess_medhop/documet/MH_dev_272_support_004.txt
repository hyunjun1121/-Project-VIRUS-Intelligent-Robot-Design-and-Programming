P06401 -B regulation of insulin-like growth factor-stimulated cell migration in breast cancer cells via insulin receptor substrate-2 . Progesterone action contributes to the signaling of many growth factor pathways relevant to breast cancer tumor biology , including the insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) system . Previous work has shown that insulin receptor substrate-2 ( Q9Y4H2 ) but not P35568 levels were regulated by progestin in progesterone receptor-B ( PR-B ) isoform expressing MCF-7 cells ( C4-12 PR-B ) . Furthermore , type 1 IGF receptor ( P08069 ) signaling via Q9Y4H2 correlated with the increased cell migration observed in a number of breast cancer cell lines . Consequently , in this study , we examined whether the elevation of Q9Y4H2 protein induced by progestin was sufficient to promote P05019 -stimulated cell motility . Treatment of C4-12 PR-B cells with progestin shifted the balance of phosphorylation from P35568 to Q9Y4H2 in response to P05019 . This shift in Q9Y4H2 activation was associated with enhanced migration in C4-12 PR-B cells pretreated with progestin , but had no effect on cell proliferation or survival . Treatment of C4-12 PR-B cells with DB00834 , an antiprogestin , inhibited IGF-induced cell migration . Attenuation of Q9Y4H2 expression using small interfering RNA resulted in decreased IGF-stimulated motility . In addition , Q9Y4H2 knockdown resulted in an abrogation of P31749 /Akt phosphorylation but not mitogen-activated protein kinase . Consequently , LY294002 , a phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor , abolished IGF-induced cell motility in progestin-treated C4-12 PR-B cells . These data show a role for the PR in functionally promoting growth factor signaling , showing that levels of P41252 proteins can determine IGF-mediated biology , PR-B signaling regulates Q9Y4H2 expression , and that Q9Y4H2 can mediate IGF-induced cell migration via phosphoinositide-3-kinase in breast cancer cells .
