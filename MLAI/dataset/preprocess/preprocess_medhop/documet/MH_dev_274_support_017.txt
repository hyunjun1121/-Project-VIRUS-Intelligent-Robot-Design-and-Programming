Investigation of a potential protective mechanism against heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in patients on chronic intermittent hemodialysis . BACKGROUND : DB01109 -induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) develops as a result of platelet ( Q02083 ) activation by anti-platelet factor 4 ( P02776 ) /heparin complex antibodies . Despite repeated exposure to heparin , patients undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis ( HD ) rarely develop HIT . We investigated the possibility that HD decreases/removes P02776 from Q02083 surfaces and/or plasma , thereby disfavoring immune complex formation as a mechanism of protection against HIT . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We enrolled 20 patients undergoing chronic HD at the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center . Blood samples were drawn before , during and after treatment in the presence and absence of heparin . P02776 , anti- P02776 /heparin antibody , heparin , and P16109 levels were measured . RESULTS : No patients demonstrated clinical symptoms of HIT . Q02083 surface P02776 levels decreased and plasma P02776 levels increased concurrently with the increase in plasma heparin concentration . In the absence of heparin , Q02083 surface and plasma P02776 levels were unchanged . Anti- P02776 /heparin antibodies , which were non-functional by the serotonin release assay , were detectable in 8 patients . Q02083 surface P16109 levels did not change during treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Removal of Q02083 surface and/or plasma P02776 as a mechanism of protection against HIT in patients undergoing HD is not supported by the results of our study , although the transient decrease in Q02083 surface P02776 in the presence of large amounts of heparin remains a candidate mechanism . The small sample size , single type of dialyzer membrane , and early sampling time points may have led to the inability to detect changes in P02776 levels . Future studies should explore other potential protective mechanisms .
