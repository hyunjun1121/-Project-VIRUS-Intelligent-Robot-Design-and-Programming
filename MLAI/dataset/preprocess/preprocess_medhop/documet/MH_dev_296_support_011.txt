Selective expression of the large neutral amino acid transporter at the blood-brain barrier . Amino acid supply in brain is regulated by the activity of the large neutral amino acid transporter ( O43561 ) at the brain capillary endothelial cell , which forms the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) in vivo . Bovine BBB poly(A)(+) RNA was isolated from 2.0 kg of fresh bovine brain and size fractionated on a sucrose density gradient , and a size-fractionated bovine BBB cDNA library in the pSPORT vector was prepared . The full-length cDNA encoding the bovine BBB O43561 was isolated from this library , and the predicted amino acid sequence was 89-92 % identical to the Q01650 isoform . The bovine BBB Q01650 mRNA produced a 10-fold enhancement in tryptophan transport into frog oocytes coinjected with bovine BBB Q01650 mRNA and the mRNA for P08195 , which encodes the heavy chain of the heterodimer . DB00150 transport into the mRNA-injected oocytes was sodium independent and was specifically inhibited by other large neutral amino acids , and the K(m) of tryptophan transport was 31.5 +/- 5.5 microM . Northern blotting with the bovine BBB Q01650 cDNA showed that the Q01650 mRNA is 100-fold higher in isolated bovine brain capillaries compared with P13671 rat glioma cells or rat brain , and the Q01650 mRNA was not detected in rat liver , heart , lung , or kidney . These studies show that the Q01650 transcript is selectively expressed at the BBB compared with other tissues , and the abundance of the Q01650 mRNA at the BBB is manyfold higher than that of transcripts such as the P08195 antigen , actin , or the Glut1 glucose transporter .
