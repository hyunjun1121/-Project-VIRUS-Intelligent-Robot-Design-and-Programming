Loss of androgen receptor expression promotes a stem-like cell phenotype in prostate cancer through P40763 signaling . P10275 ( AR ) signaling is important for prostate cancer progression . However , androgen-deprivation and/or AR targeting-based therapies often lead to resistance . Here , we demonstrate that loss of AR expression results in P40763 activation in prostate cancer cells . AR downregulation further leads to development of prostate cancer stem-like cells ( CSC ) , which requires P40763 . In human prostate tumor tissues , elevated cancer stem-like cell markers coincide with those cells exhibiting high P40763 activity and low AR expression . AR downregulation-induced P40763 activation is mediated through increased interleukin ( IL ) -6 expression . Treating mice with soluble P05231 receptor fusion protein or silencing P40763 in tumor cells significantly reduced prostate tumor growth and CSCs . Together , these findings indicate an opposing role of AR and P40763 in prostate CSC development .
