Preclinical in vivo evaluation of rapamycin in human malignant peripheral nerve sheath explant xenograft . Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( P21359 ) patients are prone to the development of malignant tumors , the most common being Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor ( MPNST ) . P21359 -MPNST patients have an overall poor survival due to systemic metastasis . Currently , the management of MPNSTs includes surgery and radiation ; however , conventional chemotherapy is not very effective , underscoring the need for effective biologically-targeted therapies . Recently , the P21359 gene product , neurofibromin , was shown to negatively regulate the phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Protein Kinase-B ( Akt ) /mammalian Target Of DB00877 ( P42345 ) pathway , with loss of neurofibromin expression in established human MPNST cell lines associated with high levels of P42345 activity . We developed and characterized a human P21359 -MPNST explant grown subcutaneously in NOD-SCID mice , to evaluate the effect of the P42345 inhibitor rapamycin . We demonstrate that rapamycin significantly inhibited human P21359 -MPNST P42345 pathway activation and explant growth in vivo at doses as low as 1.0 mg/kg/day , without systemic toxicities . While rapamycin was effective at reducing P21359 -MPNST proliferation and angiogenesis , with decreased CyclinD1 and P15692 respectively , there was no increase in tumor apoptosis . DB00877 effectively decreased activation of S6 downstream of P42345 , but there was accompanied increased Akt activation . This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential and limitations of rapamycin in P21359 -associated , and likely sporadic , MPNSTs .
