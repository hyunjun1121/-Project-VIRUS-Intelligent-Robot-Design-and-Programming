Persistent Cdk2 inactivation drives growth arrest of P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells in response to dual inhibitor of P12931 and P00519 kinases SKI606 . Complementary inhibition of tyrosine and P12931 kinases implement dual P12931 / P00519 inhibitor effects in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Here , we show that one such inhibitor , DB06616 , induces persistent Cdk2 inactivation leading to growth arrest of P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells either IM-sensitive or driven to IM-resistance by other events than gene overexpression and point mutations . Inhibition of Akt serine/threonine kinase , a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI-3k ) target that integrates Q92817 TK signaling with membrane-associated P12931 kinases , is a central component of restored expression and subcellular redistribution of Cdk2 regulatory signals ( P38936 and p27 and Cdc25A phosphatase ) in response to DB06616 . The putative roles of growth factor ( namely P08700 ) autocrine loop in P11274 - P00519 -expressing progenitor progression towards a drug-resistant phenotype are discussed .
