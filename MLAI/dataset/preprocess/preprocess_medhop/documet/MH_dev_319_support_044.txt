Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents . Part 9 : P08908 and 5-HT2 receptor affinity of some 2- and 3-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carbolines . The P08908 and 5-HT2 receptor affinity of 2- and 3-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carbolines 1-8 , 10 and 12-15 has been determined . It has been found that the specific P08908 affinity of the protonated form ( KiAH+ ) 2-n-hexyl derivatives 4 , 8 , 14 and DB04829 is of the same order . It has been shown by means of molecular modelling methods that pharmacophores of all the active compounds can adopt a common position at the P08908 receptor model . The model also offers an explanation for the observed stereoselectivity chiral compounds .
