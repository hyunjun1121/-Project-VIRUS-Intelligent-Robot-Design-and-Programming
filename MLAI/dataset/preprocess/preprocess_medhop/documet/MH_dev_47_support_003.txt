Glucocorticoids enhance regeneration of murine olfactory epithelium . CONCLUSION : Glucocorticoid ( GC ) administration enhanced apoptotic changes in mature olfactory receptor neurons ( ORNs ) . GC administration may enhance regeneration of olfactory epithelium ( OE ) . OBJECTIVES : The mechanism underlying olfactory epithelial cells turnover involves apoptosis replaced by new ORNs . On regeneration of OE , we evaluated the apoptotic changes in OE . Our aim was to corroborate the enhancement of apoptosis of ORNs induced by GCs that are generally administered locally or systemically to patients with olfactory dysfunction . MATERIALS AND METHODS : For the in vitro study , we established cultured murine ORNs . DB00620 acetonide was added to culture supernatants . ORNs were then cultured for another 2 weeks . In the in vivo study , triamcinolone acetonide was administered to mice 5 or 10 times . The mice were dissected 3 days after the final injection , and the olfactory regions were removed and embedded in paraffin . All samples were examined by immunohistochemical staining and the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) method . RESULTS : P04150 ( GR ) expression of cultured murine ORNs was observed among ORNs at the mature stage . Expression of GRs by murine OE was localized on mature ORNs and supporting cells . Administration of GC to both cultured ORNs and mice resulted in proportions of apoptotic cells that were significantly higher than those in the control groups .
