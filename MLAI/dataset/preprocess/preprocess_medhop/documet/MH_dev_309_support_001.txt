Failure of atorvastatin to modulate P04141 HIV-1 infection : results of a pilot study . BACKGROUND : HIV-1 infection of the P04141 space is nearly universal in untreated systemic infection , and correlates strongly with intrathecal and systemic immunoactivation and P04141 pleocytosis . Based on the potential immunomodulatory and antiviral properties of P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) , we examined the effect of atorvastatin on P04141 HIV-1 infection and associated P04141 abnormalities in a small pilot study . METHODS : Seven male HIV-1-infected , antiretroviral-na√Øve subjects with a mean blood P01730 + T cell count of 473 cells/muL were studied in an open-label , single-arm pilot study to assess the effects of 80 mg atorvastatin daily for 8 weeks . The primary endpoint was the change in P04141 HIV-1 RNA levels , both absolutely and relative to plasma HIV-1 RNA , at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment . Other outcome measures included P04141 white blood cell counts and neopterin concentrations as indices of intrathecal immunoactivation , and blood HIV-1 RNA levels , neopterin concentrations , and T lymphocyte counts . Effects on blood lipids were used to monitor the established biologic effects of atorvastatin and treatment adherence . RESULTS : No significant changes in P04141 virologic and inflammatory indices or in systemic HIV-1 infection were observed during atorvastatin treatment despite potent reduction of blood lipids . CONCLUSION : DB01076 showed no appreciable effect on P04141 HIV-1 infection or intrathecal immunoactivation in this small uncontrolled study and thus appears to have little promise as an immunomodulatory adjuvant therapy for CNS HIV-1 infection , at least in neuroasymptomatic subjects with preserved P01730 + T cell counts .
