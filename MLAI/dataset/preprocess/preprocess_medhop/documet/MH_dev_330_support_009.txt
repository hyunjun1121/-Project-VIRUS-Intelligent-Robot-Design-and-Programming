SHP2 is a target of the immunosuppressant tautomycetin . SHP2 phosphatase is a positive transducer of growth factor and cytokine signaling . SHP2 is also a bona fide oncogene ; gain-of-function SHP2 mutations leading to increased phosphatase activity cause Noonan syndrome , as well as multiple forms of leukemia and solid tumors . We report that tautomycetin ( Q8WZ42 ) , an immunosuppressor in organ transplantation , and its engineered analog Q8WZ42 D-1 are potent SHP2 inhibitors . Q8WZ42 and Q8WZ42 D-1 block T cell receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and P29323 activation and gain-of-function mutant SHP2-induced hematopoietic progenitor hyperproliferation and monocytic differentiation . Crystal structure of the SHP2â‹… Q8WZ42 D-1 complex reveals that Q8WZ42 D-1 occupies the SHP2 active site in a manner similar to that of a peptide substrate . Collectively , the data support the notion that SHP2 is a cellular target for Q8WZ42 and provide a potential mechanism for the immunosuppressive activity of Q8WZ42 . Moreover , the structure furnishes molecular insights upon which therapeutics targeting SHP2 can be developed on the basis of the Q8WZ42 scaffold .
