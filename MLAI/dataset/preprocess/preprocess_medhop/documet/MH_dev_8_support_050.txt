Does a nonclassical signaling mechanism underlie an increase of estradiol-mediated gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor binding in ovine pituitary cells ? DB00783 ( E2 ) is the major regulator of P30968 ( GnRHR ) gene expression and number during the periovulatory period ; however , the mechanisms underlying E2 regulation of the P30968 gene remain undefined . Herein , we find that E2 conjugated to BSA ( E2-BSA ) mimics the stimulatory effect of E2 on DB00644 binding in primary cultures of ovine pituitary cells . The time course for maximal DB00644 analog binding was similar for both E2 and E2-BSA . The ability of E2 and E2-BSA to increase DB00644 analog binding was blocked by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) antagonist DB00947 . Also , increased DB00644 analog binding in response to E2 and the selective P03372 agonist propylpyrazole triol was blocked by expression of a dominant-negative form of P03372 ( L540Q ) . Thus , membrane-associated P03372 is the likely candidate for mediating E2 activation of the P30968 gene . As DB02527 response element binding protein ( CREB ) is an established target for E2 activation in gonadotrophs , we next explored a potential role for this protein as an intracellular mediator of the E2 signal . Consistent with this possibility , adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB ( A-CREB ) completely abolished the ability of E2 to increase DB00644 analog binding in primary cultures of ovine pituitary cells . Finally , the presence of membrane-associated E2 binding sites on ovine pituitary cells was demonstrated using a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of E2-BSA . We suggest that E2 regulation of GnRHR number during the preovulatory period reflects a membrane site of action and may proceed through a nonclassical signaling mechanism , specifically a CREB-dependent pathway .
