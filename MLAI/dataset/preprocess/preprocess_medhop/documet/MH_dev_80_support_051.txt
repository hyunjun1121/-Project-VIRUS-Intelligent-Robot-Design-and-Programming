Human lung fibroblasts increase P01730 (+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in co-cultured P01730 (+) lymphocytes . Aim of this study was to evaluate functional modifications induced by human lung fibroblasts in co-cultured P01730 (+) T lymphocytes . P01730 (+) T cells , resting or stimulated with ionomycin/PMA for 6h , were co-cultured with fibroblasts isolated from pulmonary biopsies , in contact or separated by a semi-permeable membrane . The expression of CD25 , P16410 , TGF-β , IFNγ , P60568 , P05112 , P22301 and Foxp3 was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis . Fibroblasts induced a significant increment in CD25(+) cells in co-cultured activated P01730 (+) T lymphocytes separated by a membrane . Moreover , fibroblasts treatment with a P35354 inhibitor abrogated the increment in CD25(+) cells whereas exogenous DB00917 restored it . The CD25(+) subpopulation was characterized by increased presence of Fox- P09131 , P16410 , P22301 and TGF-β positive cells while IFN-γ and P60568 positive cells were diminished . Proliferative response of P01730 (+) to the anti CD3/ P10747 -Abs was abrogated in P01730 (+) co-cultured with fibroblasts thus demonstrating a suppressive feature of the expanded CD25(+) subpopulation .
