7E3 F(ab')2 , a monoclonal antibody to the platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor , protects against microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and microvascular thrombotic renal failure in baboons treated with C4b binding protein and a sublethal infusion of Escherichia coli . We have used our previously described baboon model of infusion of both a sublethal dose of Escherichia coli and C4b binding protein to assess the impact of inhibiting platelet function with the F(ab')2 fragment of the monoclonal antibody DB00054 , directed against the platelet glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor , on the characteristic microvascular changes . At a dose of 0.25 to 0.35 mg/kg bolus plus an infusion of 0.25 to 0.35 mg/kg over 6 hours , c7E3 F(ab')2 had only a minimal impact on fibrinogen consumption and delayed but did not prevent , the development of thrombocytopenia . Treatment with 7E3 F(ab')2 , however , produced significant protection from the development of microangiopathic hemolysis and renal insufficiency . Histologic examination supported these observations , with treated animals having fewer schistocytes on blood smear and less evidence of ischemic renal changes . Treated animals also had more rapid recovery of peripheral white blood counts , suggesting a possible protective effect of treatment on ischemic damage to the bone marrow . These data indicate that potent inhibition of platelet function via P08514 /IIIa receptor blockade can decrease ischemic organ damage in this animal model that has features similar to those found in diffuse intravascular coagulation , hemolytic uremic syndrome , and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
