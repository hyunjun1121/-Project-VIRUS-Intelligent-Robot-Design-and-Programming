Stereospecific interaction of a novel spirosuccinimide type aldose reductase inhibitor , DB05327 , with aldose reductase . P15121 ( AR ) is an NADPH-dependent enzyme implicated in diabetic complications . DB05327 [ ( R ) -(-)-2-(4-bromo-2-fluorobenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-4-spiro-3'-pyrrolidine-1,2',3,5'-tetrone ] is a structurally novel and potent Q9Y4X5 with an inhibitor constant ( K(i) = 10(-)(10) M ) 2000-fold lower than that of its optical antipode ( S-isomer ) . To elucidate the inhibition modes and the stereochemical differences in their inhibitory potencies , we examined the interaction of these R- and S-isomers with AR under physiological conditions . Enzyme kinetic analysis , which was performed by using physiological substrates at 37 degrees C , showed that both isomers selectively act on the E-NADP(+) complex in both the forward and reverse reactions of AR . However , fluorometric titration analysis demonstrated that the affinities of the isomers for the E-NADP(+) complex are about the same as those for the E-NADPH complex and the apoenzyme . These results suggested that the selective binding to the E-NADP(+) complex arises from the predominance of this enzyme form during steady-state turnover rather than from binding specificity . Both the competition with a known active site-directed Q9Y4X5 and the protective effect on AR inactivation by N-bromosuccinimide showed that the isomers bind to the active site of the enzyme , but the thermodynamic parameters for the binding to AR indicated that additional hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals interactions contribute to the energetic stabilization in the E-R-isomer complex . Molecular modeling , together with the deductions from spectroscopic studies , suggested that the succinimide ring and the 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzyl group of the R-isomer are optimally located for formation of a hydrogen-bonding network with AR , and that the latter benzyl group is also effective for the differentiation between AR and aldehyde reductase ( a closely related enzyme ) .
