Regulation of Q01094 -induced apoptosis by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation . The transcription factor adenovirus E2 promoter-binding factor ( E2F ) -1 normally enhances cell-cycle progression , but it also induces apoptosis under certain conditions , including DNA damage and serum deprivation . Although DNA damage facilitates the phosphorylation and stabilization of Q01094 to trigger apoptosis , how serum starvation renders cells vulnerable to Q01094 -induced apoptosis remains unclear . Because poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 ( P09874 ) , a nuclear enzyme essential for genomic stability and chromatin remodeling , interacts directly with Q01094 , we investigated the effects of P09874 on Q01094 -mediated functions in the presence and absence of serum . P09874 attenuation , which increased Q01094 transactivation , induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest under normal growth conditions , but enhanced Q01094 -induced apoptosis in serum-starved cells . Interestingly , basal P09874 activity was sufficient to modify Q01094 by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , which stabilized the interaction between Q01094 and the O00499 tumor suppressor in the nucleus . Accordingly , O00499 acted as an P06400 -independent Q01094 corepressor . Because Q01094 directly activates the O00499 gene promoter , O00499 curbed Q01094 activity through a negative-feedback mechanism . Conversely , when the O00499 - Q01094 interaction was abolished by P09874 suppression , Q01094 continuously increased O00499 levels . This is functionally germane , as P09874 -depletion-associated G2/M arrest was reversed by the transfection of O00499 siRNA . Moreover , PARP-inhibitor-associated anti-transformation activity was compromised by the coexpression of dominant-negative O00499 . Because serum starvation massively reduced the Q01094 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , we conclude that the release of O00499 from hypo-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Q01094 is a mechanism by which serum starvation promotes Q01094 -induced apoptosis .
