No significant association between genetic variants in 7 candidate genes and response to methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD . Results from pharmacogenetic investigations of methylphenidate ( DB00422 ) response in patients with ADHD are still inconsistent , especially among adults . This study investigates the role of genetic variants ( P31645 , P28222 , Q8IWU9 , P09172 , P21917 , P21964 , and P60880 ) in the response to DB00422 in a sample of 164 adults . Genes were chosen owing to previous evidence for an influence in ADHD susceptibility . No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between DB00422 responders and nonresponders were detected . In conclusion , our findings do not support an effect of these genes in the pharmacogenetics of DB00422 among adults with ADHD .
