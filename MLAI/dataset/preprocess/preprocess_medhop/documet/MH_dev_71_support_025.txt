Glucocorticoid-induced surface expression of annexin 1 blocks beta2-integrin adhesion of human eosinophils to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 surrogate protein . BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids attenuate the population of eosinophils and T lymphocytes in asthmatic airways . The decrease in airway eosinophilia is caused both by accelerated cell death and by induction of blockade of integrin adhesion . In this study , we examined the hypothesis that annexin 1 surface expression , which is upregulated by the glucocorticoid receptor , prevents integrin adhesion essential to cell migration by blocking intracellular translocation of cytosolic group IV phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) . OBJECTIVE : To examine the relationship of the glucocorticoid on annexin 1 expression and the effect of blockade of annexin 1 activity on adhesion of human eosinophils in vitro . To determine the relationship between annexin 1surface expression and nuclear membrane translocation of P47712 . METHODS : Eosinophils isolated from human peripheral blood were pretreated with fluticasone propionate ( FP ) , and beta2-integrin adhesion was measured after stimulation with P05113 or eotaxin . Effects of FP on P47712 expression , phosphorylation , and translocation were determined . The role of annexin 1 was examined by using annexin 1 blocking antibody and/or mimetic peptides . RESULTS : DB00588 decreased stimulated eosinophil adhesion and caused 4-fold increase in annexin 1 expression on the plasma membrane . Inhibition of adhesion by FP was blocked with annexin 1 blocking antibody . Annexin 1 N-terminal mimetic peptide also blocked beta2-integrin adhesion . Translocation of P47712 to the nuclear membrane was significantly blocked by incubation with FP . Blockade was reversed with annexin 1 blocking antibody . CONCLUSION : Blockade of beta2-integrin adhesion by glucocorticoid is regulated by annexin 1 , which blocks P47712 translocation to nuclear membrane .
