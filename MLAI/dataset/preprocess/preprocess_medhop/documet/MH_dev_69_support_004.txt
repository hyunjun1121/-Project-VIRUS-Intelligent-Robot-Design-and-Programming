Glycogen synthase kinase 3B in bovine oocytes and granulosa cells : possible involvement in meiosis during in vitro maturation . Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) regulates cellular metabolism and cell cycle via different signalling pathways . In response to insulin and growth factors GSK3 is serine-phosphorylated and inactivated . We analysed P49841 expression and activation in bovine cumulus cells ( CC ) and oocytes at different meiotic stages in vitro in parallel with Q96HU1 kinases P29323 ( P27361 / P28482 ) and p38 ( Q16539 ) . P49841 localised to cytoplasm in granulosa cells and in oocytes throughout folliculogenesis . In mature metaphase-II ( MII ) oocytes , P49841 was concentrated to the region of midzone between the oocyte and the first polar body , as well as active phospho- DB00156 Aurora A kinase ( O14965 ) . During in vitro maturation ( IVM ) , in oocytes , phospho- DB00133 (9)- P49841 level increased as well as phospho- P27361 / P28482 , while phospho- Q16539 decreased . In CC , phospho- Q16539 increased upon germinal vesicle breakdown ( GVBD ) /metaphase-I ( MI ) and then decreased during transition to MII . Administration of inhibitors of GSK3 activity ( lithium chloride or 2'Z,3'E -6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime ) rapidly increased phospho- DB00133 (9)- P49841 , and led to transient decrease of phospho- P27361 / P28482 and to durable enhancing of phospho- Q16539 in granulosa primary cell culture . GSK3 inhibitors during IVM diminished cumulus expansion and delayed meiotic progression . In cumulus , phospho- Q16539 level was significantly higher in the presence of inhibitors , comparing with control , through the time of MI/MII transition . In oocytes , phospho- P49841 was increased and phospho- P27361 / P28482 was decreased before GVBD and oocytes were mainly arrested at MI . Therefore , P49841 might regulate oocyte meiosis , notably MI/MII transition being the part of P27361 /1 and Q16539 pathways in oocytes and CC . P49841 might be also involved in the local activation of O14965 that controls this transition .
