Effect of vitamin C on the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin in human endothelial cells . DB00126 has long been known for its beneficial vascular effects , but its mechanism of action remains unclear . Recent reports suggest that vitamin C may prevent endothelial dysfunction by scavenging free radicals and increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide . To investigate this area further , we studied the effect of vitamin C ( 10(-4) M ) and Mn(III) tetrakis ( 4-benzoic acid ) porphyrin chloride ( MnTBAP ; 10(-5) M ) , a scavenger of superoxide , hydrogen peroxide , and peroxynitrite , on endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) enzymatic activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells . L- DB00155 formation ( a measure of P29474 enzymatic activity ) was significantly increased in cells treated for 24 h with vitamin C . No effect was observed after MnTBAP treatment . Chronic administration of vitamin C also had no effect on P29474 protein expression . Treatment with vitamin C for 24 h significantly increased levels of the P29474 co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , whereas MnTBAP did not affect its levels . Sepiapterin ( 10(-4) M ) , a precursor of BH4 , significantly increased P29474 activity , whereas addition of vitamin C to cells treated with sepiapterin did not cause any further increase in P29474 activity . Our results suggest that the beneficial effect of vitamin C on endothelial function is best explained by increased intracellular BH4 content and subsequent enhancement of P29474 activity . This effect appears to be independent of the ability of vitamin C to scavenge superoxide anions .
