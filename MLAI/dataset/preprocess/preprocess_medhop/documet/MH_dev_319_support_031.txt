Toll-like receptor signaling is impaired in dendritic cells from patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia . Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) , which is defective in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) , is expressed not only in B cells but also in monocytes and dendritic cells ( DCs ) . DCs play a crucial role in the innate immune response against infections by sensing pathogens through Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) . However , it is not known whether Q06187 deficiency in XLA might impair TLR-mediated signaling in DCs , which are susceptible to various infections . The phenotypic maturation and cytokine production mediated by TLRs were examined in monocyte-derived DC from XLA patients and normal controls . The TLR expression in DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry . TLR-mediated signaling in DCs was evaluated for the phenotypic maturation based on Q01151 expression and production of cytokines , such as P01375 , P05231 and IL-12p70 . TLR levels in DCs were similar between XLA and controls . O60603 , O00206 and Q9NYK1 /8 ligands elicited less phenotypic maturation of DCs from XLA patients than normal controls based on Q01151 expression . Stimulation with O60603 , O00206 and Q9NYK1 /8 ligands , as well as O15455 ligand , resulted in significantly lower production of P01375 , but neither P05231 nor IL-12p70 , by DCs from XLA patients in comparison to normal controls . These findings suggest that Q06187 may thus be required for TLR signaling in DCs . The impaired TLR signaling in DCs may therefore be partly responsible for the occurrence of severe infections with bacteria and some viruses in XLA patients .
