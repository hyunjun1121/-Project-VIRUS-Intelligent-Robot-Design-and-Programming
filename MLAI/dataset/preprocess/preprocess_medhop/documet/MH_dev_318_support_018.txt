Redox regulation of P60484 by S-nitrosothiols . P60484 ( phosphatase with sequence homology to tensin ) is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase that regulates many cellular processes . Activity of the enzyme is dependent on the redox state of the active site cysteine such that oxidation by H2O2 leads to inhibition . Because S-nitrosothiols are known to modify enzymes containing reactive cysteines , we hypothesized that S-nitrosothiols would oxidize P60484 and inhibit its phosphatase activity . In the present study , we show that S-nitrosocysteine ( CSNO ) , S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) , and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( P60880 ) reversibly oxidized recombinant P60484 . In addition , CSNO led to concentration- and time-dependent oxidation of endogenous cellular P60484 . However , in contrast , GSNO and P60880 were effective only when coincubated with cysteine , suggesting that these nitrosothiols must react with cysteine to form CSNO , which can be transferred across cell membranes . Oxidation of cellular P60484 resulted from thiol modification and led to reversible inhibition of phosphatase activity . Although oxidation of P60484 by H2O2 led to formation of an intramolecular disulfide , oxidation of P60484 by CSNO seemed to lead to formation of a mixed disulfide . Glutathionylation of cellular proteins by incubating cells with diamide or incubating cellular extracts with GSSG oxidized P60484 in a manner similar to that of CSNO . Overall , these data demonstrate for the first time that S-nitrosothiols oxidatively modify P60484 , leading to reversible inhibition of its phosphatase activity , and suggest that the oxidized species is a mixed disulfide .
