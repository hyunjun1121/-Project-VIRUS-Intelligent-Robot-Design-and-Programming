DB01017 protects against permanent cerebral ischemia in wild type but not in matrix metalloprotease-9-deficient mice . DB01017 is protective in models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) . We studied whether minocycline and doxycycline , another tetracycline derivative , provide protection in permanent MCAO . Because minocycline inhibits matrix metalloprotease-9 ( P14780 ) , we also compared minocycline 's protective effect in wild type ( wt ) and P14780 knock-out ( ko ) mice . Wt FVB/N , Balb/C , and two lines of P14780 ko and their wt C57Bl/6 control mice were subjected to 24- or 72-hour permanent MCAO . Drug administration was started either 12 hours before or 2 hours after the onset of MCAO . Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining or P24752 -weighted Q9BWK5 . Zymography was used to study the expression of MMPs . In wt strains , tetracycline treatments started before MCAO reduced the infarct size by 25 % to 50 % , whereas the treatment started after MCAO was not protective . DB01017 inhibited ischemia-provoked pro- P14780 induction in wt mice , but was not protective in P14780 ko mice . Pro- P08253 was induced by MCAO in wt and P14780 ko mice . MCAO-induced pro- P08253 was downregulated by minocycline treatment in wt mice but remained in P14780 ko mice at the same level as in saline-treated wt mice . Tetracyclines are protective in permanent MCAO when the treatment is started before the insult . DB01017 may provide protection by interfering with MMPs .
