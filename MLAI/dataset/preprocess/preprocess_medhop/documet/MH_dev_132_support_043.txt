Dual effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on angiogenesis in type 1 diabetic mice . OBJECTIVE : We analyzed the beneficial therapeutic effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) on both retinal and hind limb neovascularization in diabetic mice . METHODS AND RESULTS : Diabetic mice ( streptozotocin , 40 mg/kg ) were treated with or without ACEI ( DB00790 , 3 mg/kg per day ) or AT1 receptor blocker ( DB00796 , 20 mg/kg ) for 4 months . Hind limb ischemia was then induced by right femoral artery ligature for 1 additional month . In the ischemic leg , angiographic score , capillary density , and foot perfusion were increased by 2.7 , 2.0-fold , and 1.6-fold , respectively , in ACEI-treated diabetic mice compared with untreated diabetic animals ( P < 0.01 ) . ACEI also raised vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) protein level by 1.4-fold in ischemic diabetic leg . This ACEI pro-angiogenic effect was totally blunted in diabetic bradykinin B2 receptor-deficient animals , suggesting that it was mediated by the bradykinin pathway . In the diabetic retina , angiotensinogen and P12821 mRNA levels were increased by 2.8-fold and 4.1-fold , respectively ( P < 0.01 versus nondiabetic mice ) , highlighting a local activation of renin-angiotensin system . Diabetes also raised P15692 protein level by 1.5-fold ( P < 0.05 versus nondiabetic mice ) . Treatments with ACEI and AT1 receptor blocker hampered diabetes-induced P15692 upregulation and retinal neovascularization . CONCLUSIONS : P12821 inhibition improved neovascularization in the diabetic ischemic leg through activation of bradykinin signaling , whereas it reduced vessel growth in the diabetic retina through inhibition of overacting Ang II pathway .
