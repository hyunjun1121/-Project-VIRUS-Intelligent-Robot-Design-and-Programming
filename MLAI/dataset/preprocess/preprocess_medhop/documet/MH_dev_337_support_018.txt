Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella pseudospiralis : developmental patterns of enzymes involved in thymidylate biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage . P04818 , dihydrofolate reductase and P33316 specific activities were found to remain at a high and constant level in crude extracts from adult worms of Trichinella spiralis , as well as from muscle larvae of both Trichinella spiralis ( isolated 1-24 months after infection ) and Trichinella pseudospiralis ( isolated 5.5-13 months after infection ) . The results obtained with Trichinella pseudospiralis muscle larvae isolated with the use of pepsin did not differ from those obtained when pepsin was not used . No thymidine kinase activity could be detected in muscle larvae of either species and thymidine phosphorylase could be found only in T. pseudospiralis larvae isolated without the use of pepsin . Muscle larvae of both species contained orotidylate phosphoribosyl transferase activity , pointing to a possibility of 5-fluorouracil activation . DB02745 phosphorylase , another enzyme involved in 5-fluorouracil anabolism , was also present in T. pseudospiralis muscle larvae . Results of comparative studies on inhibition of purified T. spiralis and rat thymidylate synthases by substrate ( 4-thio-5-fluoro- DB03800 , 2-thio-5-fluoro-dCMP and N4-hydroxy-dCMP ) and cofactor ( ZD 9331 ) analogues indicated only DB03800 analogues to show feeble selectivity towards the parasite enzyme . A hypothesis is discussed , assuming high expression of thymidylate synthase in muscle larvae to be connected with their cells being arrested in the cell cycle .
