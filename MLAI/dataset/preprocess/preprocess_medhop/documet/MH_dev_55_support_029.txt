[ Dyslipidemia in insulin resistance and its improvement by troglitazone ] . Dyslipideia in insulin resistant state are characterized by 3 major components ; increased triglyceride levels , decreased high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , and change in the composition of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol particle which results in small-dense LDL . P01308 resistance is thought to lead to overproduction of very low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) cholesterol through the decreased peripheral lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) activity , increased production of apolipoprotein B-100 and decreased clearance of remnant particles . DB00197 , an insulin action enhancer , decreases the triglyceride level , increases HDL cholesterol level and decreases th proportion of small-dense LDL through the direct effect on lipoprotein metabolism . However , activation of P37231 is considered to possese potential atherogeneity and more closer examination is needed .
