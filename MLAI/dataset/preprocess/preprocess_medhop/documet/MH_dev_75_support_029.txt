Induction of prostacyclin receptor expression in human erythroleukemia cells . We have identified both high-affinity ( KD = 36 +/- 3 nM ) and low-affinity ( KD = 2.1 +/- 0.8 microM ) prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) -receptor sites on human erythroleukemia ( HEL ) cells using the radiolabelled prostacyclin analogue . [3H]iloprost . The addition of the phorbol ester , TPA , to the culture medium caused a 5-10-fold increase in the number of both the low- and the high-affinity sites , without any change in their affinity constants . DB01088 stimulated HEL cell membrane adenylate cyclase activity 5-fold . This stimulation was potentiated in the presence of GTP , indicating a conventional P43119 -G2-adenylate cyclase system . HEL cells represent a source of prostacyclin receptor mRNA which may be of value in expression cloning of this receptor .
