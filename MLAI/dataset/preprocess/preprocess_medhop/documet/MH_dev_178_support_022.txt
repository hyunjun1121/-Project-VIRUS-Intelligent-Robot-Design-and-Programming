Chronic atrial fibrillation alters the functional properties of If in the human atrium . INTRODUCTION : Despite the evidence that the hyperpolarization-activated current ( If ) is highly modulated in human cardiomyopathies , no definite data exist in chronic atrial fibrillation ( cAF ) . We investigated the expression , function , and modulation of If in human cAF . METHODS AND RESULTS : Right atrial samples were obtained from sinus rhythm ( SR , n = 49 ) or cAF ( duration > 1 year , n = 31 ) patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery . Among f-channel isoforms expressed in the human atrium ( O60741 , 2 and 4 ) , Q9Y3Q4 mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR were significantly reduced . However , protein expression was preserved in cAF compared to SR ( +85 % for Q9Y3Q4 ) ; concurrently , miR-1 expression was significantly reduced . In patch-clamped atrial myocytes , current-specific conductance ( gf ) was significantly increased in cAF at voltages around the threshold for If activation ( -60 to -80 mV ) ; accordingly , a 10-mV rightward shift of the activation curve occurred ( P < 0.01 ) . Î²-Adrenergic and Q13639 receptor stimulation exerted similar effects on If in cAF and SR cells , while the P01160 -mediated effect was significantly reduced ( P < 0.02 ) , suggesting downregulation of natriuretic peptide signaling . CONCLUSIONS : In human cAF modifications in transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms of HCN channels occur , associated with a slight yet significant gain-of-function of If , which may contribute to enhanced atrial ectopy .
