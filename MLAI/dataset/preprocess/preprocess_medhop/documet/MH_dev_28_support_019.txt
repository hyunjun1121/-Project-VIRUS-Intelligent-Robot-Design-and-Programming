Interactions between bradykinin ( BK ) and cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression in peptidoglycan-polysaccharide ( PG-PS ) -induced arthritis . Bradykinin ( BK ) , a vasoactive , proinflammatory nonapeptide , promotes cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) expression , leukocyte sequestration , inter-endothelial gap formation , and protein extravasation in postcapillary venules . These effects are mediated by bradykinin-1 ( P46663 ) and-2 ( P30411 ) receptors . We delineated some of the mechanisms by which BK could influence chronic inflammation by altering P62158 expression on leukocytes , endothelium , and synovium in joint sections of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-injected Lewis rats . Blocking P46663 results in significantly increased joint inflammation . Immunohistochemistry of the P46663 antagonist group revealed increased leukocyte and synovial CD11b and CD54 expression and increased CD11b and P16070 endothelial expression . P30411 antagonism decreased leukocyte and synovial P16070 and CD54 and endothelial CD11b expression . Although these findings implicate P30411 involvement in the acute phase of inflammation by facilitating leukocyte activation ( CD11b ) , homing ( P16070 ) , and transmigration ( CD54 ) . Treatment with a P30411 antagonist did not affect the disease evolution in this model . In contrast , when both BK receptors are blocked , the aggravation of inflammation by P46663 blockade is neutralized and there is no difference from the disease-untreated model . Our findings suggest that P46663 and P30411 signaling show physiologic antagonism . P46663 signaling suggests involvement in down-regulation of leukocyte activation , transmigration , and homing . Further studies are needed to evaluate the B1 receptor agonist 's role in this model .
