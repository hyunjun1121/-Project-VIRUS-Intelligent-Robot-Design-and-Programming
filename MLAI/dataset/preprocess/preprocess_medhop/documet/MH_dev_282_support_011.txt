Behind the curtain : cellular mechanisms for allosteric modulation of calcium-sensing receptors . DB01373 -sensing receptors ( P41180 ) are integral to regulation of systemic Ca(2+) homeostasis . Altered expression levels or mutations in P41180 cause Ca(2+) handling diseases . P41180 is regulated by both endogenous allosteric modulators and allosteric drugs , including the first Food and Drug Administration-approved allosteric agonist , DB01012 HCl ( SensiparÂ® ) . Recent studies suggest that allosteric modulators not only alter function of plasma membrane-localized P41180 , but regulate P41180 stability at the endoplasmic reticulum . This brief review summarizes our current understanding of the role of membrane-permeant allosteric agonists in cotranslational stabilization of P41180 , and highlights additional , indirect , signalling-dependent role(s) for membrane-impermeant allosteric drugs . Overall , these studies suggest that allosteric drugs act at multiple cellular organelles to control receptor abundance and hence function , and that drug hydrophobicity can bias the relative contributions of plasma membrane and intracellular organelles to P41180 abundance and signalling .
