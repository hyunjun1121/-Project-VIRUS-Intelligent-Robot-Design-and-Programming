Definition of functional domains in P135gag-myb-ets and p48v-myb proteins required to maintain the response of neuroretina cells to basic fibroblast growth factor . The v-myb- and v-ets-containing E26 retrovirus induces the proliferation of chicken neuroretina ( P21554 ) cells in minimal medium . Proliferation of E26 P21554 cells is strongly stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) . The v-myb-containing avian myeloblastosis virus also induces the proliferation of infected P21554 cells stimulated by P09038 . Both E26 P21554 and avian myeloblastosis virus P21554 cells are able to form colonies in soft agar in the presence of P09038 . This suggests that the v-myb product , a nuclear sequence-specific DNA-binding protein which activates gene expression in transient transfection assays , plays a role in the proliferative response of the infected P21554 cells . To determine the structure-function relationships of P135gag-myb-ets and p48v-myb , we have used deletion mutants expressed in retroviral vectors and have analyzed their effect on P21554 cell proliferation as well as their effect on the P21554 cell response to P09038 . We show that v-ets is not required for P09038 stimulation but increases the proliferation of P21554 cells in minimal medium . In the v-myb mutants , the gag sequences derived from the helper virus increase the potency of the myb gene . The carboxyl-terminal domain required for the growth and transformation of myeloid cells and needed for maximal trans-activation in transient DNA transfection assays in fibroblasts was not required for the growth and P09038 response of P21554 cells . In contrast , the domain encompassing amino acids 240 to 301 ( containing part of the transcriptional activation domain of v-myb ) was absolutely required for the response of P21554 cells to P09038 and could be functionally replaced by the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein of herpes simplex virus .
