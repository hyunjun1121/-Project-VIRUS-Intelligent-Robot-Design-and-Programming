Molecular target modulation , imaging , and clinical evaluation of gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients treated with sunitinib malate after imatinib failure . PURPOSE : To evaluate sunitinib activity and potential cellular and molecular correlates in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) patients after imatinib failure , in addition to assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of different dose schedules . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : In this open-label , dose-ranging , phase I/II study , 97 patients with metastatic imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST received sunitinib at doses of 25 , 50 , or 75 mg/d on one of three schedules . Serial tumor imaging was done using computed tomography and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography scanning . PK and cell proliferation and P10721 phosphorylation status in tumor biopsies were also analyzed . RESULTS : Clinical benefit was observed in 52 patients ( 54 % : 7 objective partial responses , 45 stable disease > or =6 months ) . Decreased tumor glycolytic activity was shown in most patients within 7 days of starting sunitinib using [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography . DB01268 treatment was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation by > 25 % in 52 % of cases analyzed and reduced levels of phospho- P10721 in tumor biopsies ( indicating target modulation ) . The recommended dose schedule was 50 mg/d for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment . On the 50-mg dose across all schedules , 79 % of PK-evaluable patients achieved total drug trough concentrations above the target concentration ( 50 ng/mL ) within 14 days of dosing . In addition , adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity . CONCLUSION : Cellular and molecular analyses showed that sunitinib clinical activity is associated with inhibition of P10721 in GIST following imatinib failure , illustrating the rational approach used to develop a therapy aimed at the underlying oncogenic signaling pathway aberrancy .
