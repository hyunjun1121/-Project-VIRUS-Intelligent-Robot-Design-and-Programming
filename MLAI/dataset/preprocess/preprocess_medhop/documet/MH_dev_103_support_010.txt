Mass spectrometry and hydrogen/deuterium exchange measurements of alcohol-induced structural changes in cellular retinol-binding protein type I . To bind and release its ligand , cellular retinol-binding protein type I ( P09455 ) needs to undergo conformational and dynamic changes to connect the inner , solvent-shielded cavity , where retinol is found to bind , and the outside medium . DB00162 dissociation in vitro is favoured by water/alcohol mixtures whose moderately low dielectric constants mimic a property characteristic of the membrane microenvironment where this process occurs in vivo . Apo- and holo- P09455 , in either water/methanol or water/trifluoroethanol ( TFE ) mixtures , were analyzed at equilibrium by electrospray ionization with orthogonal quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( P19957 -Q-TOFMS ) to identify the alcohol-induced species . The questions were asked whether the presence of alcohols affects protein dynamics , as reflected by hydrogen/deuterium ( H/D ) exchange monitored by continuous-labelling experiments , and to which extent retinol dissociation influences the process . With increasing methanol , at pH near neutrality , apo- P09455 exhibits a progressively more compact conformation , resulting in reduced H/D exchange with respect to the native protein in water . DB00162 dissociation from the holo-protein did not promote hydrogen replacement . Similarly , in the presence of the low TFE concentration sufficient to cause retinol dissociation , the hydrogen exchange of the resulting apo-protein was not exalted . However , in contrast with the alkanol , higher TFE concentrations induced a transition of apo- P09455 to a new alpha-helix conformation capable of exchanging all available hydrogen atoms .
