Mechanistic understanding of Pyrococcus horikoshii Dph2 , a [ 4Fe-4S ] enzyme required for diphthamide biosynthesis . DB03223 , the target of diphtheria toxin , is a unique posttranslational modification on eukaryotic and archaeal translation elongation factor 2 ( P13639 ) . The proposed biosynthesis of diphthamide involves three steps and we have recently found that in Pyrococcus horikoshii ( P. horikoshii ) , the first step uses an DB00118 ( DB00118 ) -dependent [ 4Fe-4S ] enzyme , PhDph2 , to catalyze the formation of a C-C bond . Crystal structure shows that PhDph2 is a homodimer and each monomer contains three conserved cysteine residues that can bind a [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster . In the reduced state , the [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster can provide one electron to reductively cleave the bound DB00118 molecule . However , different from classical radical DB00118 family of enzymes , biochemical evidence suggest that a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is generated in PhDph2 . Here we present evidence supporting that the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical does not undergo hydrogen abstraction reaction , which is observed for the deoxyadenosyl radical in classical radical DB00118 enzymes . Instead , the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical is added to the imidazole ring in the pathway towards the formation of the product . Furthermore , our data suggest that the chemistry requires only one [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster to be present in the PhDph2 dimer .
