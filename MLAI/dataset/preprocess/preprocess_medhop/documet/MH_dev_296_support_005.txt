Homology modeling , molecular dynamic simulation and docking studies of cyclin dependent kinase 1 . In order to develop promising cyclin dependent kinase 1 inhibitors , homology modeling , docking and molecular dynamic simulation techniques were applied to get insight into the functional and structural properties of cyclin dependent kinase 1 ( P06493 ) . Since there is no reported P06493 crystal structural data , the three dimensional structure of P06493 was constructed based on homology modeling . An extensive dynamic simulation was also performed on a DB03496 - P06493 complex for probing the binding pattern of DB03496 in the active site of P06493 . The binding modes of other inhibitors to P06493 were also proposed by molecular docking . The structural requirement for developing more potent P06493 inhibitors was obtained by the above-mentioned molecular simulations and pharmacophore modeling .
