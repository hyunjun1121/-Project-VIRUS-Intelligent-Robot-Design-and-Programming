SUMOylation of tissue transglutaminase as link between oxidative stress and inflammation . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is a monogenic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) gene . CF is characterized by chronic bacterial lung infections and inflammation , and we have previously reported that tissue transglutaminase ( TG2 ) , a multifunctional enzyme critical to several diseases , is constitutively up-regulated in CF airways and drives chronic inflammation . Here , we demonstrate that the generation of an oxidative stress induced by P13569 -defective function leads to protein inhibitor of activated P35610 (PIAS)y-mediated TG2 SUMOylation and inhibits TG2 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation , leading to sustained TG2 activation . This prevents peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )gamma and IkBalpha SUMOylation , leading to NF-kappaB activation and to an uncontrolled inflammatory response . Cellular homeostasis can be restored by small ubiquitin-like modifier ( SUMO ) -1 or Q8N2W9 gene silencing , which induce TG2 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation , restore PPARgamma SUMOylation , and prevent IkBalpha cross-linking and degradation , thus switching off inflammation . DB06757 superoxide dismutase overexpression as well as the treatment with the synthetic superoxide dismutase mimetic EUK-134 control Q8N2W9 -TG2 interaction and TG2 SUMOylation . TG2 inhibition switches off inflammation in vitro as well as in vivo in a homozygous F508del- P13569 mouse model . Thus , TG2 may function as a link between oxidative stress and inflammation by driving the decision as to whether a protein should undergo SUMO-mediated regulation or degradation . Targeting TG2-SUMO interactions might represent a new option to control disease evolution in CF patients as well as in other chronic inflammatory diseases , neurodegenerative pathologies , and cancer .
