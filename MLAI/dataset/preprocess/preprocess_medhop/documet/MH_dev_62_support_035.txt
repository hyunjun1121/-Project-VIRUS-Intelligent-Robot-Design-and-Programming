Treatment of Crohn 's disease with certolizumab pegol . Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Targeting P01375 with monoclonal antibodies has changed the therapeutic landscape for tackling refractory and complicated CD . Intravenous use of infliximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody to P01375 is , however , limited by the occurrence of adverse events , infusion reactions , infectious complications , aggravation of heart failure , the occurrence of neurological demyelinating conditions and induction of rare malignancies . The incremental development of next-generation P01375 antibodies and binding proteins through antibody-engineering techniques has followed , with the aim of producing efficacious drugs that are less expensive to produce , have a convenient route of administration and have fewer side effects . DB08904 ( DB08904 , Cimzia ) is an engineered humanized anti- P01375 antibody Fab fragment that minimizes the protein component and is conjugated to polyethylene glycol . Clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe active CD . Reported adverse events in the clinical trial program have been largely of mild-to-moderate severity , and occurred at similar frequencies in the active-treatment and placebo groups . DB08904 will be a useful addition to the armamentarium of biologic agents that can be used for the long-term treatment of CD .
