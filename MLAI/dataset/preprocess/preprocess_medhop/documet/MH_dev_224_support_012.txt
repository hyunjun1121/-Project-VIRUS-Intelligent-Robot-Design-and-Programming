Bradykinin inhibits high glucose- and growth factor-induced collagen synthesis in mesangial cells through the B2-kinin receptor . Mesangial matrix expansion is an early lesion leading to glomeruloclerosis and chronic renal diseases . A beneficial effect is achieved with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI ) , which also favor bradykinin ( BK ) B2 receptor ( P30411 ) activation . To define the underlying mechanism , we hypothesized that P30411 activation could be a negative regulator of collagen synthesis in mesangial cells ( MC ) . We investigated the effect of BK on collagen synthesis and signaling in MC . Inflammation was evaluated by intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) expression . BK inhibited collagen I and IV synthesis stimulated by high glucose , epithelial growth factor ( P01133 ) , and transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) but did not alter P05362 . Inhibition of collagen synthesis was P30411 but not P46663 mediated . PKC or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors mimicked the BK effect . P30411 activation inhibited TGF-β- and P01133 -induced Erk1/2 , Q15796 /3 , Akt S473 , and P00533 phosphorylation . A phosphatase inhibitor prevented BK effects . The in vivo impact of P30411 on mesangial matrix expansion was assessed in streptozotocin-diabetic rodents . Deletion of P30411 increased mesangial matrix expansion and albuminuria in diabetic mice . In diabetic rats , matrix expansion and albuminuria were prevented by ACEI but not by ACEI and P30411 antagonist cotreatment . Consistently , the lowered BK content of diabetic glomeruli was restored by ACEI . In conclusion , deficient P30411 activation aggravated mesangial matrix expansion in diabetic rodents whereas P30411 activation reduced MC collagen synthesis by a mechanism targeting Erk1/2 and Akt , common pathways activated by P01133 and TGF-β . Taken together , the data support the hypothesis of an antifibrosing effect of P30411 activation .
