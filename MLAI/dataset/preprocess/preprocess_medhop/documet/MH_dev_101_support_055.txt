A high-content RNAi-screening assay to identify modulators of cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C cells . Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ) is an inherited lipid storage disorder characterized by a defect in intracellular trafficking of exogenous cholesterol and glycosphingolipids . A goal for therapeutic treatment of NPC is to decrease/normalize cholesterol accumulation . We developed a functional genomics-based assay , combining high-throughput RNA interference ( HT-RNAi ) screening with high-content fluorescence imaging to identify specific genes in NPC cells that will result in more normal cholesterol levels in the diseased cells . Conditions for siRNA tranfections were optimized for 2 NPC fibroblast cell lines ( GM03123 , GM18453 ) and a normal fibroblast cell line ( GM05659 ) . RNAi screening was done using a focused-set siRNA library targeting 40 cholesterol trafficking-associated genes , knowledge mined from the existing literature on NPC disease , and/or their association with O15118 / P61916 genes . We utilized filipin staining as a measure of cholesterol accumulation in fixed NPC cells . Data analysis of these screens confirmed several genes including P01130 and P51151 that reduced cholesterol content in NPC cells . Nine genes were validated using filipin staining to detect unesterified cholesterol as well as cholesteryl BODIPY esters to study lipid trafficking . Gene silencing was also confirmed using qRT-PCR . Our results show that this technology can be applied to larger screens to identify genes responsible for lipid accumulation and/or trafficking in NPC disease , which could be instrumental in developing innovative therapies for individuals afflicted with NPC disease .
