The biological activities of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its synthetic analog 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-vitamin D3 in normal human osteoblastic cells and human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells are modulated by 17-beta estradiol and dependent on stage of differentiation . We compared the effects of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] and its analog , 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-vitamin D3 [ 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 ] , as well as their interactions with 17-beta estradiol ( E2 ) on osteoblastic function in our human normal ( HOB ) and osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cell models representing two different stages of differentiation , the more differentiated HOB+DEX cells and SaOS+DEX cells , and the corresponding less differentiated HOB-DEX and SaOS-DEX cells . The differential effects of DB00136 and 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 and the modulation by E2 on ALP activity in HOB-DEX and HOB+DEX cells were small but significant . The most significant effects were seen in SaOS+DEX cells , in which 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 was 100-fold more potent than DB00136 , the maximal enhancement being exerted at 0.1 nM and 10 nM , respectively . E2 enhanced the stimulatory effects of both compounds , with ALP being increased 2-fold at 0.1 nM ( p < 0.001 ) . P02818 ( OC ) production in HOB-DEX cells was stimulated 1.3 to 1.4-fold by DB00136 and 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 at a concentration of 0.01 nM , with E2 inhibiting the effect of 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 . In SaOS-DEX and SaOS+DEX cells , DB00136 and 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 stimulated OC production 1.6-fold at 0.1 nM with E2 slightly enhancing the effect of DB00136 . Western blot analysis of DB00136 receptor ( P11473 ) levels showed that in SaOS+DEX cells , the effect of DB00136 was larger than that of 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 . These results show that 1alpha,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 is biologically active in human osteoblasts .
