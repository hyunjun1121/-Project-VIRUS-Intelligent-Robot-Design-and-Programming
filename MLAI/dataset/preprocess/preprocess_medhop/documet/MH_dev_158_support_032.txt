P62937 may contribute to the inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis through induction of matrix degrading enzymes and inflammatory cytokines from macrophages . P62937 ( CypA ) levels increase in the sera and synovial fluids of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , but the cell types expressing CypA and the function of CypA in the pathogenesis of RA are not known yet . Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed high level CypA staining in the macrophages in the lining layers of human RA and osteoarthritis synovium . Low level CypA staining was also detected in endothelial cells , lymphocytes , and smooth muscle cells in RA synovium . Further investigation of the CypA function using monocyte/macrophage cell lines revealed that CypA induced expression of cytokine/chemokines such as P01375 , P10145 , P13500 , and IL-1beta and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 through a pathway that is dependent on NFkappaB activation . Furthermore , P14780 staining pattern overlapped with that of CypA in both RA and OA synovium . Our data suggest that CypA may stimulate macrophages to degrade joint cartilage via P14780 expression and promote inflammation via pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion .
