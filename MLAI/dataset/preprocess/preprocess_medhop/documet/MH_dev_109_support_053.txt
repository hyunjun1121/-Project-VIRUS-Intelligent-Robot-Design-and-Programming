Flow cytometric analysis of platelet activation throughout normal gestation . OBJECTIVE : To measure platelet activation in normal pregnancy , before and after stimulation with agonists , with a whole blood flow cytometric technique . METHODS : In a cross-sectional study , 5 mL of whole blood was collected from healthy volunteers ( nine in the first trimester , ten in the second trimester , 35 in the third trimester , and 32 nonpregnant controls ) . Platelets were treated with an agonist ( thrombin or U-46619 , a thromboxane A2 analogue ) or buffer and were exposed to saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibodies directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins ( GPs ) : DB00054 ( fibrinogen receptor P08514 /IIIa ) , P28222 ( alpha granule marker P16109 ) , and 6D1 ( P04275 receptor GPIb ) . Mean fluorescence intensity was determined for 5000 platelets per sample by using a flow cytometer . RESULTS : In the absence of agonist , no significant difference between groups was found in antibody binding . At no stage of pregnancy were circulating activated platelets detected . Platelets from third-trimester subjects bound significantly less 7E3 than platelets of controls or of first- or second-trimester subjects after stimulation with high-dose thrombin ( P < .05 for all comparisons ) . Down-regulation of 6D1 on platelets after stimulation with high-dose U-46619 was significantly greater in third-trimester gravidas than in controls or first-trimester subjects ( P < .05 ) . CONCLUSION : Pregnancy does not increase the percentage of activated platelets in the circulation . Platelet reactivity is altered in the third trimester , as evidenced by decreased antibody binding to fibrinogen receptor epitope and enhanced down-regulation of a P04275 receptor epitope .
