Effect of canagliflozin on renal threshold for glucose , glycemia , and body weight in normal and diabetic animal models . BACKGROUND : DB08907 is a sodium glucose co-transporter ( SGLT ) 2 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . METHODS : (14)C-alpha-methylglucoside uptake in Chinese hamster ovary-K cells expressing human , rat , or mouse SGLT2 or P13866 ; (3)H-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 myoblasts ; and 2-electrode voltage clamp recording of oocytes expressing human SGLT3 were analyzed . Graded glucose infusions were performed to determine rate of urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) at different blood glucose ( BG ) concentrations and the renal threshold for glucose excretion ( RT(G) ) in vehicle or canagliflozin-treated Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) rats . This study aimed to characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of canagliflozin in vitro and in preclinical models of T2DM and obesity . RESULTS : Treatment with canagliflozin 1 mg/kg lowered RT(G) from 415±12 mg/dl to 94±10 mg/dl in ZDF rats while maintaining a threshold relationship between BG and UGE with virtually no UGE observed when BG was below RT(G) . DB08907 dose-dependently decreased BG concentrations in db/db mice treated acutely . In ZDF rats treated for 4 weeks , canagliflozin decreased glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and improved measures of insulin secretion . In obese animal models , canagliflozin increased UGE and decreased BG , body weight gain , epididymal fat , liver weight , and the respiratory exchange ratio . CONCLUSIONS : DB08907 lowered RT(G) and increased UGE , improved glycemic control and beta-cell function in rodent models of T2DM , and reduced body weight gain in rodent models of obesity .
