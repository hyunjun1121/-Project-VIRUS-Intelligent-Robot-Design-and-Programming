P04629 -fused gene ( Q92734 ) is a new partner of Q9UM73 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma producing two structurally different Q92734 - Q9UM73 translocations . Anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) is associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) , which generates the P06748 - Q9UM73 fusion gene encoding an 80-kD protein . Several studies have suggested that genes other than P06748 may be fused to the Q9UM73 gene . Here we have identified P04629 -fused gene ( Q92734 ) as a new Q9UM73 partner in 2 ALCL , 1 of which exhibited a t(2;3)(p23;q21) . In these cases , Q92734 was involved in 2 different fusion genes , Q92734 - Q9UM73 (S) and Q92734 - Q9UM73 (L) , coding respectively 85-kD and 97-kD chimeric proteins . The Q9UM73 breakpoint in these translocations was the same as in the classic t(2;5) translocation . These 2 proteins were both active in an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay showing that the new cloned cDNA sequences are translated into chimeric proteins with functional activity . These findings indicate that Q92734 can provide an alternative to P06748 as a fusion partner responsible for activation of the Q9UM73 and the pathogenesis of ALCL .
