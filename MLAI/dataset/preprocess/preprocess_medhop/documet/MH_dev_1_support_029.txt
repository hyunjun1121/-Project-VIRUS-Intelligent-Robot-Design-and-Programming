Circulating cytokines and risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma : a prospective study . Cytokines play important roles in B-cell activation , proliferation , and apoptosis , thus may be etiologically related to risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( B- Q9NZ71 ) . However , the association between circulating levels of cytokines and B- Q9NZ71 risk has not been prospectively studied in non-HIV populations . The objective of this study was to assess this association by conducting a case-control study nested within a prospective cohort of non-HIV-infected , healthy women . Fifteen cytokines were measured in samples collected a median of 8.2 years prior to diagnosis in 92 cases and two matched controls per case . Only cytokines that showed adequate temporal reproducibility over a two-year period were included . The odds ratio ( OR ) for the highest tertile relative to the lowest was elevated for soluble P60568 receptor ( sIL-2R ) ( OR = 2.5 , 95 % CI = 1.4-4.7 , p ( trend ) < 0.01 ) and decreased for P35225 ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI = 0. P35326 .0 , p ( trend ) = 0.05 ) . Three other cytokines were marginally associated with risk of B- Q9NZ71 : P01375 ( OR = 1.7 , 95 % CI = 0.9-3.3 , p ( trend ) = 0.11 ) , sTNF-R2 ( OR = 1.9 , 95 % CI = 0.9-3.5 , p ( trend ) = 0.06 ) , and P05113 ( OR = 0.5 , 95 % CI = 0.3-1.0 , p ( trend ) = 0.06 ) . No association was observed between B- Q9NZ71 risk and levels of the other cytokines measured ( IL-1beta , IL-1RA , P60568 , P05112 , P05231 , P22301 , IL-12 , IL-12p70 , CRP and sTNF- Q96GN5 ) . This study suggests that dysregulated cytokines may be involved in B- Q9NZ71 development .
