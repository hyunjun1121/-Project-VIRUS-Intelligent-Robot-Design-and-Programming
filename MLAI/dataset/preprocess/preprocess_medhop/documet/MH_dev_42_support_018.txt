Novel Q02750 mutation identified by mutational analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway genes in lung adenocarcinoma . Genetic lesions affecting a number of kinases and other elements within the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . We performed mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas to uncover other potential somatic mutations in genes of this pathway that could contribute to lung tumorigenesis . We have identified in 2 of 207 primary lung tumors a somatic activating mutation in exon 2 of Q02750 ( i.e. , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or Q02750 ) that substitutes asparagine for lysine at amino acid 57 ( K57N ) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase . Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the P00533 signaling pathway ( i.e. , P00533 , P04626 , P01116 , P42336 , and P15056 ) . Expression of mutant , but not wild-type , Q02750 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) -1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/ P13726 cells . A selective MEK inhibitor , AZD6244 , inhibits mutant-induced P29323 activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/ P13726 cells . We also screened 85 NSCLC cell lines for Q02750 exon 2 mutations ; one line ( NCI-H1437 ) harbors a Q56P substitution , a known transformation-competent allele of Q02750 originally identified in rat fibroblasts , and is sensitive to treatment with AZD6244 . Q02750 mutants have not previously been reported in lung cancer and may provide a target for effective therapy in a small subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma .
