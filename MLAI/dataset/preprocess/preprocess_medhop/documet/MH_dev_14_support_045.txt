Swept-source optical coherence tomography of lower limb wound healing with histopathological correlation . Direct noninvasive visualization of wound bed with depth information is important to understand the tissue repair . We correlate skin swept-source-optical coherence tomography ( O75051 ) with histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation on traumatic lower limb wounds under honey dressing to compare and assess the tissue repair features acquired noninvasively and invasively . Analysis of optical biopsy identifies an uppermost brighter band for stratum corneum with region specific thickness ( p < 0.0001 ) and gray-level intensity ( p < 0.0001 ) variation . Below the stratum corneum , variation in optical intensities is remarkable in different regions of the wound bed . Correlation between O75051 and microscopic observations are explored especially in respect to progressive growth and maturation of the epithelial and subepithelial components . Characteristic transition of uniform hypolucid band in O75051 image for depigmented zone to wavy highly lucid band in the pigmented zone could be directly correlated with the microscopic findings . The transformation of prematured epithelium of depigmented area , with low expression of P12830 , to matured epithelium with higher P12830 expression in pigmented zone , implicated plausible change in their optical properties as depicted in O75051 . This correlated evaluation of multimodal images demonstrates applicability of swept-source- O75051 in wound research and importance of integrated approach in validation of new technology .
