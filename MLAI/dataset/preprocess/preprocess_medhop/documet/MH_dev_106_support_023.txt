Mutual exclusivity analysis of genetic and epigenetic drivers in melanoma identifies a link between p14 Q8N726 and RARβ signaling . Melanoma genomes contain thousands of alterations including : mutations , copy number alterations , structural aberrations , and methylation changes . The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral , with only a small minority representing " drivers " that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors . Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors , reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate . Here , a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns . Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)- P11802 -RB , DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways . In addition , an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β ( P10826 ) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14( Q8N726 ) ( P < 0.0001 ) , suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14( Q8N726 ) . Mechanistically , all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) treatment increased the expression of p14( Q8N726 ) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14( Q8N726 ) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ . Furthermore , the ability of DB00755 to induce senescence is reduced in p14( Q8N726 )-depleted melanocytes , and we provide proof-of-concept that DB00755 can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14( Q8N726 ) signaling axis , independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status . IMPLICATIONS : These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14( Q8N726 ) with potential implications for melanoma treatment .
