P04035 inhibition induces IL-1beta release through Rac1/PI3K/ P31749 -dependent caspase-1 activation . Q03426 deficiency ( MKD ) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurring fever episodes and results from disturbed isoprenoid biosynthesis . Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MKD patients secrete high levels of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) because of the presence of hyperactive caspase-1 , and this has been proposed to be the primary cause of recurring inflammation . Here we show that inhibition of P04035 by simvastatin treatment , mimicking MKD , results in increased IL-1beta secretion in a Rac1/PI3K-dependent manner . Simvastatin treatment was found to activate protein kinase B ( P31749 ) /c-akt , a primary effector of PI3K , and ectopic expression of constitutively active P31749 was sufficient to induce IL-1beta release . The small GTPase Rac1 was activated by simvastatin , and this was required for both P31749 activation and IL-1beta secretion . IL-1beta release is mediated by caspase-1 , and simvastatin treatment resulted in increased caspase-1 activity in a Rac1/PI3K-dependent manner . These data suggest that , in MKD , dysregulated isoprenoid biosynthesis activates Rac1/PI3K/ P31749 , resulting in caspase-1 activation with increased IL-1beta release . Importantly , inhibition of Rac1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from MKD patients resulted in a dramatic reduction in IL-1beta release . These data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of Rac1 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of MKD .
