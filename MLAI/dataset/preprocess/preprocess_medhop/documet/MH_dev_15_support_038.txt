Human platelet antigen genotype is associated with progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C . Although progression of fibrosis in the chronic hepatitis C depends on environmental , viral , and host factors , genetic polymorphisms have been associated recently with this progression , including the expression of integrins , adhesion proteins . Some integrins expressed on the platelet membrane show polymorphic antigenic determinants called human platelet antigens ( Q9Y251 ) , where the major ones are Q9Y251 -1 , -3 , -5 . The association between HCV infection and Q9Y251 -5b has been demonstrated . Similarly , the Q9Y251 profile could determine if Q9Y251 is related to progression of fibrosis . The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between the frequencies of Q9Y251 -1 , -3 , and -5 and degree of fibrosis in HCV-infected patients . Genomic DNA from 143 HCV-infected patients was used as the source for Q9Y251 genotyping by PCR-SSP or PCR-RFLP . Progression of fibrosis was evaluated using the METAVIR scoring system , and the patients were grouped according to degree of fibrosis into P55008 ( n = 81 , with F1 , portal fibrosis without septa or F2 , few septa ) and G2 ( n = 62 , with P13726 , numerous septa , or F4 , cirrhosis ) . Statistical analysis was performed using the proportional odds model . The genotypic frequency of Q9Y251 -1a/1b was significantly higher in the patients in G2 . To evaluate the influence of the time of infection to the development of fibrosis and its effect on the genetic factor Q9Y251 -1 , 96 patients from 143 studied were evaluated considering the time of HCV infection , and these results suggest that the Q9Y251 -1a/1b genotype promotes the development of fibrosis in HCV infection with time .
