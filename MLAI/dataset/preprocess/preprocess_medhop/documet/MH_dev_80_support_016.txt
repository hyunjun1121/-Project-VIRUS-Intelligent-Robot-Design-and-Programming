Intracellular capture of P33681 in antigen-presenting cells reduces costimulatory activity . P16410 gene constructs were designed to express P16410 exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Four different P16410 gene constructs were transfected into P29320 293 ( human embryonic kidney ) and A20 ( Balb/c mouse B lymphoma ) cells . All constructs contained an ER retention signal and coded for P16410 expression in the ER . One of the constructs , which contained the membrane part of P16410 , coded for an expression both on the cell surface and in the ER . Three of the expressed P16410 types ( including the ER-membrane-expressed form ) caused a reduced surface expression of P33681 in the A20 cells . Only constructs which allow dimerization of P16410 showed this effect . It is assumed that intracellular P16410 bound P33681 and inhibited therefore the transport of P33681 to the surface . The binding obviously caused also an enhanced degradation of the complexes because both proteins showed a low concentration in the transfected cell lines . P16410 -transfected and P33681 -reduced A20 cells showed a diminished costimulating activity upon T cells . This was demonstrated by a reduced proliferation of T cells from ovalbumin-immunized Balb/c mice , incubated with ovalbumin peptide-primed P16410 -transfected A20 cells .
