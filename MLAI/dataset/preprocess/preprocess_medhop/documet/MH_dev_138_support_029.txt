[ Genetic aspects of occupational chronic obstructive lung disease under exposure to various risk factors ] . The article deals with data on association of SNP rs1828591 of Q96QV1 gene with COLD development under exposure to dust and chemical factors . SNP rs1800470 of TGFbeta1 gene is associated with occupational COLD under exposure to dust and did not show connection with COLD under exposure to chemical aerosols . No association was seen between SNP rs4129267 of IL-6R gene and SNP rs1051730 of P32297 gene with occupational COLD under exposure to the studied factors . SNP rs1828591 of Q96QV1 gene is associated with occupational COLD development under exposure to dust and chemical factors . Study of association of genotype and phenotypic features of COLD revealed the following trends : " dust " COLD patients with genotype AA SNP rs1800470 of TGFbeta1 gene show lower level of P02741 and P01375 , if compared with other genotypes .
