Whole blood lead concentration and erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( P13716 ) activity in selected canine populations in Greece . In a total number of 275 dogs of various ages , sex and breed , blood lead concentrations ( O43927 ) and erythrocyte P13716 activity were measured . Sixty-six of the dogs were living in lead mining areas ( Group A ) , 157 in urban areas ( Group B ) and 52 in rural areas ( Group C ) of Greece . Mean O43927 differed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) between locations and were 326,97 and 68 micrograms/L , respectively . Mean P13716 activity was significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) only between Groups A and B as between groups A and C . A significant ( P < 0.05 ) negative correlation existed between O43927 and P13716 activity . A normal range of erythrocyte P13716 activity of 807-992 mumol/ DB02272 /LRBC/h was established for dogs . None of the 33 Group A dogs and 2 of the Group B dogs that had a O43927 of 350 micrograms/L presented clinical signs indicating acute or chronic lead intoxication . No erythrocyte basophilic stippling or large number of nucleated red blood cells were seen in the 30 dogs of Group A with O43927 > 350 micrograms/L .
