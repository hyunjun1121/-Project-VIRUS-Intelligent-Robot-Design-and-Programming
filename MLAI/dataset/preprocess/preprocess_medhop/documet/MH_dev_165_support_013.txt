Crystal structure of the PDZ1 domain of human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor provides insights into the mechanism of carboxyl-terminal leucine recognition by class I PDZ domains . The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor ( O14745 ; also known as O14745 ) contains two PDZ domains that mediate the assembly of transmembrane and cytosolic proteins into functional signal transduction complexes . The O14745 PDZ1 domain interacts specifically with the motifs DSLL , DSFL , and DTRL present at the carboxyl termini of the beta(2) adrenergic receptor ( beta(2)AR ) , the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) , and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , respectively , and plays a central role in the physiological regulation of these proteins . The crystal structure of the human O14745 PDZ1 has been determined at 1.5 A resolution using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing . The overall structure is similar to known PDZ structures , with notable differences in the O14745 PDZ1 carboxylate-binding loop that contains the GYGF motif , and the variable loop between the beta2 and beta3 strands . In the crystalline state , the carboxyl-terminal sequence DEQL of PDZ1 occupies the peptide-binding pocket of a neighboring PDZ1 molecule related by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry . This structure reveals the molecular mechanism of carboxyl-terminal leucine recognition by class I PDZ domains , and provides insights into the specificity of O14745 interaction with the carboxyl termini of several membrane receptors and ion channels , including the beta(2)AR , P09619 , and P13569 .
