Loss of both phospholipid and triglyceride transfer activities of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in abetalipoproteinemia . Mutations in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) cause abetalipoproteinemia ( P00519 ) , characterized by the absence of plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins . In this study , we characterized the effects of various P55157 missense mutations found in P00519 patients with respect to their expression , subcellular location , and interaction with protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) . In addition , we characterized functional properties by analyzing phospholipid and triglyceride transfer activities and studied their ability to support apoB secretion . All the mutants colocalized with calnexin and interacted with P07237 . We found that R540H and N780Y , known to be deficient in triglyceride transfer activity , also lacked phospholipid transfer activity . Novel mutants S590I and G746E did not transfer triglycerides and phospholipids and did not assist in apoB secretion . In contrast , D384A displayed both triglyceride and phospholipid transfer activities and supported apoB secretion . These studies point out that P00519 is associated with the absence of both triglyceride and phospholipid transfer activities in P55157 .
