Endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling : a novel pathway in OSA induced vascular endothelial dysfunction . The mechanism of vascular endothelial dysfunction ( VED ) and cardiovascular disease in obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is unknown . We performed a comprehensive evaluation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) function directly in the microcirculatory endothelial tissue of OSA patients who have very low cardiovascular risk status . Nineteen OSA patients underwent gluteal biopsies before , and after effective treatment of OSA . We measured superoxide ( O2(•-) ) and nitric oxide ( NO ) in the microcirculatory endothelium using confocal microscopy . We evaluated the effect of the NOS inhibitor l- DB04223 -Methyl-Ester ( l-NAME ) and the NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) on endothelial O2(•-) and NO in patient endothelial tissue before and after treatment . We found that P29474 is dysfunctional in OSA patients pre-treatment , and is a source of endothelial O2(•-) overproduction . P29474 dysfunction was reversible with the addition of BH4 . These findings provide a new mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in OSA patients and a potentially targetable pathway for treatment of cardiovascular risk in OSA .
