Androgen receptors , serum androgen levels and survival of breast cancer patients . Steroid receptor levels and serum androgen levels were determined in 61 breast cancer patients and 34 patients with non-malignant breast lesions . DB00624 and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate did not and androstenedione did show a difference between the two groups . Androgen levels had no influence on survival rates . P10275 ( AR ) levels correlated with progesterone receptor levels , but not with estrogen receptor levels or with tumor stage . Patients with positive AR findings had a better survival rate ; this was independent of tumor stage . AR findings may therefore be a prognostic index in breast cancer patients .
