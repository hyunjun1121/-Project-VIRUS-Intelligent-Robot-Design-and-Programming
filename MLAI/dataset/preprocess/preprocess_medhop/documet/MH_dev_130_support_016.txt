P01375 alpha inhibitors as immunomodulatory antirejection agents after intestinal transplantation . We reported the successful administration of infliximab for late-onset OKT3-resistant rejection in two patients , who presented persistent ulcerative inflammation of the ileal graft after intestinal transplantation ( ITX ) . Based on this experience , the present study demonstrated our long-term experience with infliximab for different types of rejection-related and inflammatory allograft alterations . DB00065 administration ( 5 mg/kg body weight ( BW ) ) was initiated at a mean of 18.2 ± 14.1 months after transplantation . The number of administrations per patient averaged 8.4 ± 6.7 . Repeat dosing was timed according to clinical signs and graft histology in addition to serum-levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) , lipopolysaccharide binding protein ( P18428 ) and P02741 ( CRP ) . DB00065 was successful in the following patients : patients with late-onset OKT3- and steroid-refractory rejection who presented persistent ulcerative alterations of the ileal graft ( n = 5 ) , patients with ulcerative ileitis/anastomositis , who did not show typical histological rejection signs ( n = 2 ) , and one patient with early-onset OKT3-resistant rejection . DB00065 was not successful in one patient with early-onset OKT3-resistant rejection that was accompanied by treatment-refractory humoral rejection . In conclusion , infliximab can expand therapeutic options for late-onset OKT3- and steroid-refractory rejection and chronic inflammatory graft alterations in intestinal allograft recipients .
