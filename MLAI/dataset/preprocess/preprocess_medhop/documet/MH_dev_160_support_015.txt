Treatment with anti- P01375 antibody infliximab reduces serum P40933 levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . The aim of this study was to analyze the change of serum cytokines and pentosidine levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) by infliximab treatment . Twenty-three patients with RA were studied for 30 weeks on the effects of infliximab treatment . Serum levels of P40933 , IL-16 , Q16552 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) were measured with ELISA methods and pentosidine levels were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography , both at baseline and at 14 and 30 weeks after the initial treatment with infliximab . In addition , the patients also underwent physical and routine blood examinations . The higher levels of serum P40933 in RA patients before treatment with infliximab significantly decreased at 14 and 30 weeks after the initial treatment with infliximab , but serum IL-16 , Q16552 , GM- P04141 , and pentosidine levels did not decrease . The serum Q16552 and GM- P04141 levels remained to be a limited detectable level at the pre- and posttreatment with infliximab . DB00065 treatment significantly lowered the serum levels of P40933 in patients with RA . P40933 is one of the crucial cytokines affected by infliximab .
