Vasoactive intestinal peptide induces cell cycle arrest and regulatory functions in human T cells at multiple levels . Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) is a potent anti-inflammatory neuropeptide that , by inhibiting Th1-driven responses and inducing the emergence of regulatory T cells ( T(reg) ) , has been proven successful in the induction of tolerance in various experimental models of autoimmune disorders . Here , we investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in P01282 -induced tolerance . P01282 treatment in the presence of T-cell receptor ( TCR ) signaling and P10747 costimulation induced cell cycle arrest in human T cells . P01282 blocked G(1)/S transition and inhibited the synthesis of cyclins D3 and E and the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) cdk2 and cdk4 . This effect was accompanied by maintenance of threshold levels of the CDK inhibitor p27(kip1) and impairment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -Akt signaling . Inhibition of interleukin 2 ( P60568 ) transcription and downregulation of signaling through NFAT , AP-1 , and Ras-Raf paralleled the P01282 -induced cell cycle arrest . Noteworthy from a functional point of view is the fact that P01282 -treated T cells show a regulatory phenotype characterized by high expression of CD25 , cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( P16410 ) , and Forkhead box protein 3 ( FoxP3 ) and potent suppressive activities against effector T cells . P16410 appears to be critically involved in the generation and suppressive activities of P01282 -induced T(reg) . Finally , cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) and protein kinase A ( PKA ) activation seems to mediate the P01282 -induced cell cycle arrest and T(reg) generation .
