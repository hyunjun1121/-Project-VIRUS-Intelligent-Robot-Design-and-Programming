O75915 is required for arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells via reactive oxygen species and mitochondria linked signal pathway . DB01169 , emerging as a standard therapy for refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia , induces apoptosis in a variety of malignant cell lines . O75915 , a novel retinoic acid-inducible gene , is known to be involved in apoptosis induced by various agents , for example , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate , N-4-hydroxy-phenyl-retinamide and arsenic trioxide . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying how O75915 gene is functionally involved in apoptosis remain largely unknown . Herein , our studies demonstrated that treatment of arsenic trioxide produced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and paralleled with increased O75915 expression . O75915 expression was dependent upon generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by arsenic trioxide . Knockdown of O75915 attenuated arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis , and was accompanied by significantly reduced activity of caspase-9 , enhanced Bad phosphorylation and inhibited Q02750 /2 , P27361 /2 and JNK phosphorylations . DB01169 induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was O75915 -dependent . These findings suggest that O75915 may serve as a pro-apoptotic molecule to mediate arsenic trioxide triggered apoptosis via a reactive oxygen species and mitochondria-associated signal pathway .
