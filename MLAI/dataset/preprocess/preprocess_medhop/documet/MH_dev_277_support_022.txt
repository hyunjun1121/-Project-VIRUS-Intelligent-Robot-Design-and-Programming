Exenatide twice daily : a review of its use in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Exenatide , administered subcutaneously twice daily ( DB01276 (®) ) , is a synthetic version of the natural peptide exendin-4 , which is a glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptor agonist ( incretin mimetic ) . Exenatide binds to the P43220 with the same affinity as P0C6A0 , but has a much longer half-life , since it is not degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 . Exenatide twice daily enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion , suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion , slows gastric emptying and reduces caloric intake . In well-designed clinical trials , adjunctive subcutaneous exenatide 5 or 10 μg twice daily for 16-52 weeks significantly and dose-dependently improved glycaemic control and reduced mean body weight compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral antihyperglycaemic drugs ( OADs ) and/or basal insulin . The improvements in glycaemic control and reductions in body weight were stably maintained during long-term therapy ( up to 3.5 years ) . The efficacy of adjunctive exenatide twice daily was generally similar to that of basal , prandial or biphasic insulin , sulfonylureas , rosiglitazone and lixisenatide , and less than that of liraglutide , taspoglutide or exenatide once weekly with respect to reductions in glycated haemoglobin . Exenatide twice daily was generally well tolerated ; mild to moderate nausea and vomiting , which decreased with time on therapy , were the most common adverse events . In patients not receiving concomitant sulfonylureas or insulin , the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low ; when it did occur , it was generally mild in severity . Thus , adjunctive exenatide twice daily is a valuable option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with OADs and/or basal insulin .
