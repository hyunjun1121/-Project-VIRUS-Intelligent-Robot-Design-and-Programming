P54252 represses transcription via chromatin binding , interaction with histone deacetylase 3 , and histone deacetylation . P54252 ( P01008 ) , the disease protein in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 ( P54252 ) , has been associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcriptional regulation . Here we report that normal P01008 binds to target DNA sequences in specific chromatin regions of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) gene promoter and represses transcription by recruitment of the histone deacetylase 3 ( O15379 ) , the nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) , and deacetylation of histones bound to the promoter . Both normal and expanded P01008 physiologically interacted with O15379 and NCoR in a P54252 cell model and human pons tissue ; however , normal P01008 -containing protein complexes showed increased histone deacetylase activity , whereas expanded P01008 -containing complexes had reduced deacetylase activity . Consistently , histone analyses revealed an increased acetylation of total histone H3 in expanded P01008 -expressing cells and human P54252 pons . Expanded P01008 lost the repressor function and displayed altered DNA/chromatin binding that was not associated with recruitment of O15379 , NCoR , and deacetylation of the promoter , allowing aberrant P08253 transcription via the transcription factor GATA-2 . For transcriptional repression normal P01008 cooperates with O15379 and requires its intact ubiquitin-interacting motifs ( UIMs ) , whereas aberrant transcriptional activation by expanded P01008 is independent of the UIMs but requires the catalytic cysteine of the ubiquitin protease domain . These findings demonstrate that normal P01008 binds target promoter regions and represses transcription of a GATA-2-dependent target gene via formation of histone-deacetylating repressor complexes requiring its UIM-associated function . Expanded P01008 aberrantly activates transcription via its catalytic site and loses the ability to form deacetylating repressor complexes on target chromatin regions .
