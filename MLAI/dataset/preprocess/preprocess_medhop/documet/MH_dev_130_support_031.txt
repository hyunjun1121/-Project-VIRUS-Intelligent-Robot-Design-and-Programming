The relationship of P04141 and plasma cytokine levels to cerebral white matter injury in the premature newborn . Ischemia and systemic infection are implicated in the etiology of periventricular white matter injury , a major cause of adverse motor and cognitive outcome in preterm infants . Cytokines are signaling proteins that can be produced as part of the inflammatory response to both ischemia and infection . The aim of this study was to relate cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) concentrations of P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) , and interferon gamma ( P01579 ) to magnetic resonance-defined white matter injury in preterm infants . Relationships between P04141 and plasma cytokine concentrations were also examined . Preterm infants ( < or=32 wk ) and more mature infants from The Royal Women 's Hospital , Melbourne , Australia , and Christchurch Women 's Hospital , Christchurch , New Zealand , were eligible for study if they required a clinically indicated lumbar puncture . Plasma samples were obtained in a subgroup of Christchurch infants . Preterm infants underwent advanced quantitative volumetric magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-Tesla scanner at term equivalent . One hundred forty-six infants were enrolled and 190 P04141 and 42 plasma samples obtained . There was no significant correlation between paired P04141 and plasma concentrations for any cytokine . In comparing plasma and P04141 concentrations , levels of P10145 were significantly higher in P04141 than plasma . Preterm infants with Q9BWK5 -defined cerebral white matter injury had higher levels of P05231 , P22301 , and P01375 in the P04141 than infants without such injury . Plasma cytokine concentrations may not reflect P04141 cytokine levels or inflammatory events within the brain . Elevated P04141 levels of cytokines in infants with white matter injury suggest an altered inflammatory balance .
