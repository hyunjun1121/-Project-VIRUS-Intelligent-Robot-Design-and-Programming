Celecoxib with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer . P35354 ( P35354 ) is the enzyme that normally synthesizes prostaglandins during an inflammatory response . Many primary and metastatic cancers express P35354 , and its presence is correlated with tumor angiogenesis , more invasive tumor phenotype , resistance to apoptosis , and systemic immunosuppression . The expression of P35354 is associated with a worse prognosis . Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may be beneficial in human malignancy . Regular consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) decreases the incidence of , and mortality rate resulting from , a number of types of gastrointestinal cancers . Premalignant colonic lesions regress following the administration of nonspecific P36551 inhibitors , such as sulindac ( DB00605 ) . Advanced solid tumor patients treated with indomethacin ( DB00328 ) survive twice as long as do such patients who receive supportive care alone . The U.S . Food and Drug Administration has approved specific P35354 inhibitors for the treatment of arthritis , pain , and familial adenomatous polyposis . Preclinical studies show that these drugs block angiogenesis , suppress solid tumor metastases , and slow the growth of implanted gastrointestinal cancer cell lines . The P35354 inhibitors have safely and effectively been combined with chemotherapeutic agents in experimental studies . Ongoing clinical trials are currently assessing the potential therapeutic role of P35354 inhibitors in both prevention and treatment of a diverse range of human cancers .
