[ DB01373 signaling mediated by nicotine receptors in neurons ] . DB00184 has many acute and chronic pharmacological effects . DB00184 treatment activates neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChR ) in peripheral and central nervous systems leading to depolarization and elevation of intracellular calcium levels , which are considered to cause stimulation of neurotransmitter release , synaptic transmission , intracellular signal transduction and gene expression . Multiple subtypes of nAChRs display different sensitivity to nicotinic agonists and antagonists . Each of these subtypes has a unique distribution in peripheral and central nervous systems . Although presynaptic nAChRs have been extensively studied to modulate the release of neurotransmitters , the functional importance of nAChRs in somata is not sufficiently characterized . To clarify the mechanisms of calcium signaling and its stimulation of gene expression via nAChRs in somata , we have investigated nAChR-mediating calcium signaling mechanisms including phosphorylation of Q8NFH3 /44 Q96HU1 kinase ( P29323 ) , CREB and Akt in PC12h cells . DB00184 transiently activates phosphorylation of P29323 - , CREB and Akt . DB00184 induces the activation of both P19957 kinase/Act and P29323 /CREB pathways via common pathways including non-alpha 7-nAChRs , L-type VSCC , P62158 kinase and P00533 in PC12h cells , but Src family tyrosine kinases only participate in the pathway to activate Akt . Based on these results , we discuss nAChR signaling mechanisms in neurons .
