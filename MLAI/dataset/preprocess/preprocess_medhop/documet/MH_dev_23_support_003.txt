Combination gene therapy targeting on interleukin-1β and O14788 for wear debris-induced aseptic loosening . This study investigated the efficacy of a combination gene therapy to repress interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor NF-kappa B ligand ( O14788 ) for the treatment of particulate debris-induced aseptic loosening , and tried to explore the molecular mechanism of the exogenous gene modifications on osteoclastogenesis . RAW cells activated by titanium particles were transduced with DFG-IL-1Ra ( retroviral vector encoding IL-1 receptor antagonist ) and AAV- O00300 ( adeno-associated viral vectors-osteoprotegerin ) individually or in combination for 4 weeks . Pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture media were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and gene expressions of Q9Y6Q6 , IL-1β , c-Fos , Q9Y4K3 , P45983 and CPK were examined using real-time PCR . An established knee-implant-failure mouse model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of the in vivo double-gene therapy . The surgical implantation of a titanium alloy pin into the proximal tibia was followed by monthly challenge with titanium debris . Peri-implant gene transfers of IL-1Ra and O00300 ( respectively or in combination ) were given 3 weeks after surgery . The combination of O00300 and IL-1Ra gene transfer exhibited strong synergetic effects in blockage of inflammation and osteoclastogenesis at 8 weeks after gene modification . The combination therapy reversed peri-implant bone resorption and restored implant stability when compared with either single gene transduction . Real-time PCR data indicated that the action of IL-1Ra gene therapy may be mediated via the P45983 pathway , while the reduction of osteoclastogenesis by O00300 gene modification may be regulated by c-Fos expression . In addition , both gene modifications resulted in significant diminishment of Q9Y4K3 expression .
