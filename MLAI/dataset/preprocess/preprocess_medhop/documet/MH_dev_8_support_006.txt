In vitro analysis of the E1A-homologous sequences of Q13029 . The Q13029 ( G3B/MTB-Zf ) gene was first isolated based on its ability to bind to the retinoblastoma protein ( P06400 ) . An acidic , approximately 100-amino-acid region around the P06400 -binding motif of Q13029 has structural and antigenic similarity to the conserved sequences of the E1A viral oncogene . We show here that this region interacts specifically with the E1A-binding domain of P06400 . This interaction could be disrupted by E1A or by a peptide of Q13029 homologous to the P20023 motif of E1A which is involved in binding to P06400 family proteins . Also like E1A , Q13029 can form a ternary complex with P06400 and Q01094 . Despite this similarity to E1A , however , Q13029 could not bind to the P06400 family proteins P28749 and Q08999 in vitro . The data show that the Q13029 P20023 motif can mediate differential binding to P06400 family proteins . We also mapped the shared antigenic determinant between Q13029 and E1A to a conserved sequence , designated CE1 , which is located in the C terminus of E1A . Unlike that of P25101 , the CE1 motif of Q13029 is located next to the P20023 motif . Despite this proximity , CE1 and P20023 appear to act independently . The data show similarities as well as differences between the homologous sequences of Q13029 and E1A and contribute to an understanding of the biochemistry of these proteins .
