Painless burn injury caused by post-traumatic syringomyelia . BACKGROUND : Syringomyelia , which is generally related to congenital malformations and tumors , may lead to paresthesia and dysfunctions in thermo-algesic perception . Post-traumatic syringomyelia ( Q03393 ) is a rare type of this disease characterised by the development of a cystic formation containing cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) , which develops inside the spinal cord after spinal trauma . AIM : The description of a case diagnosed as painless burn injury caused by Q03393 . METHOD : One case report . CONCLUSION : Although there are a number of reports regarding the formation of neuropathic ulcers related to syringomyelia , painless burn injury descriptions are very rare . Despite available limited data related to this subject , it is important to warn patients about traumas-especially burns-after a diagnosis of Q03393 .
