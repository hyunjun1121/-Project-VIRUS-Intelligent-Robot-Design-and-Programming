Human monocyte derived dendritic cells express functional P2X and P2Y receptors as well as ecto-nucleotidases . We investigated the expression and function of P2 receptors and ecto-nucleotidases on human monocyte derived dendritic cells ( DC ) . In addition we analyzed the effect of extracellular DB00171 on the maturation of DC . By RT-PCR , DC were found to express mRNA for several P2X ( P51575 , Q99571 , Q93086 , Q99572 ) and P2Y ( P47900 , P41231 , P51582 , P43657 , Q15077 , O00398 , Q96G91 ) receptors . As shown by FURA-2 measurement , triggering of P2 receptors resulted in an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ . In combination with P01375 -alpha , DB00171 increased the expression of the DC surface markers P33681 , Q01151 and P42081 indicating a maturation promoting effect . DC expressed the ecto-apyrase P49961 and the ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 as demonstrated by RT-PCR . Extracellular DB00171 was rapidly hydrolyzed by these ecto-enzymes as shown by separation of 3H-labeled DB00171 metabolites using a thin layer technique . These data suggest that DB00171 acts as a costimulatory factor on DC maturation .
