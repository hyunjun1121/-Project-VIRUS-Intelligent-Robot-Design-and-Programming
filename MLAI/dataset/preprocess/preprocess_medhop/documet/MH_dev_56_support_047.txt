Use of etanercept in the dermatology setting . A review . As psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic in nature , ideal treatment should have sustained efficacy , with minimal short- and long-term toxicities to allow lifelong treatment . Traditional therapies used for psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis , including phototherapies and systemic agents , do not satisfy these criteria . Ninety percent of patients surveyed in 1998 by The National Psoriasis Foundation were not satisfied with their treatment options . Several observations have supported the introduction of the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonist etanercept as a treatment for psoriatic disease , including the failure of traditional therapies to meet patient needs , evidence that P01375 plays a fundamental role in the inflammatory processes underlying psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis , and the safety and efficacy of this agent in other inflammatory , immune-mediated diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB00005 prevents initiation of the proinflammatory cascade by competitively binding P01375 . First indicated for RA , etanercept is also approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis , juvenile RA , ankylosing spondylitis , and most recently psoriasis . DB00005 provides dermatologists with a safe , effective , and convenient treatment option for patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis , which can be used continuously with or without traditional therapies . The self-administered injections provide a distinct advantage over traditional therapies that often require frequent office visits and laboratory monitoring , and other biologic agents that require administration in the doctor 's office . Dermatologists should be aware of the ongoing research with etanercept in psoriasis and other dermatologic conditions .
