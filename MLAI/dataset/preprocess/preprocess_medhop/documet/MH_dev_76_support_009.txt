New insights into the role of calcium-sensing receptor activation . The discovery of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) prompted the identification of substances that affect its function . DB01012 , for example , is a drug that allosterically modifies the receptor so as to increase its sensitivity to circulating calcium ( thus the name " calcimimetic " ) and in this way decreases parathyroid hormone secretion . Clinical use of cinacalcet is already approved for the treatment of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism , but research is ongoing to identify further potential actions of this drug . The effects and functions of the P41180 have been evaluated in different systems and tissues , beyond parathyroid glands , such arterial walls . A complete understanding of the properties of calcimimetics are of obvious clinical interest , since therapeutic indications may be affected accordingly .
