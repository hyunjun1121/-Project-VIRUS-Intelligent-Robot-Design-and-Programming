New therapies in the management of rheumatoid arthritis . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The therapeutic landscape in the management of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) has witnessed significant changes over the past decade . The ambition to improve outcomes further , minimize safety concerns and provide more convenient means of administration are all factors that continue to drive continued drug development . This review summarizes novel therapies that have been most recently under investigation . RECENT FINDINGS : More refined drug technology has seen the development of subcutaneous forms of existing therapies ( abatacept , tocilizumab ) , as well as newer-generation monoclonal antibodies ( e.g. B-cell-depleting agents , ocrelizumab and ofatumumab and the P01375 -inhibitors certolizumab and DB06674 ) . Alternative methods of targeting critical pathways , for example Blys inhibition ( atacicept ) and P05231 as opposed to P05231 receptor antagonism , have also been evaluated . Finally , small molecules are receiving increasing attention , with some of the protein kinases inhibitors particularly promising . SUMMARY : The new emerging therapies for the management of RA illustrate much diversity , in terms of both drug technology as well as the immunological target . Although not all may succeed in reaching the market , important insights can still be gained . Challenging and exciting times lie ahead as these new technologies are embraced and efforts are made to determine how best to implement in practice .
