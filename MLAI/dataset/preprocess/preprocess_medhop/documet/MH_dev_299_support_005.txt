Endothelin@25 - new agonists , antagonists , inhibitors and emerging research frontiers : IUPHAR Review 12 . Since the discovery of endothelin ( ET ) -1 in 1988 , the main components of the signalling pathway have become established , comprising three structurally similar endogenous 21-amino acid peptides , ET-1 , P20800 and P14138 , that activate two GPCRs , P25101 and ETB . Our aim in this review is to highlight the recent progress in ET research . The ET-like domain peptide , corresponding to prepro-ET-193-166 , has been proposed to be co-synthesized and released with ET-1 , to modulate the actions of the peptide . ET-1 remains the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system with a particularly long-lasting action . To date , the major therapeutic strategy to block the unwanted actions of ET in disease , principally in pulmonary arterial hypertension , has been to use antagonists that are selective for the P25101 receptor ( ambrisentan ) or that block both receptor subtypes ( DB00559 ) . DB08932 represents the next generation of antagonists , being more potent than DB00559 , with longer receptor occupancy and it is converted to an active metabolite ; properties contributing to greater pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic efficacy . A second strategy is now being more widely tested in clinical trials and uses combined inhibitors of ET-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase such as SLV306 ( daglutril ) . A third strategy based on activating the ETB receptor , has led to the renaissance of the modified peptide agonist IRL1620 as a clinical candidate in delivering anti-tumour drugs and as a pharmacological tool to investigate experimental pathophysiological conditions . Finally , we discuss biased signalling , epigenetic regulation and targeting with monoclonal antibodies as prospective new areas for ET research .
