3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase and isoprenylation inhibitors induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture . Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis may be involved in the control of vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) number in atherosclerotic lesions . 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitors have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines . To evaluate whether these agents also induce apoptosis of VSMCs , cultured rat VSMCs were treated with increasing doses of atorvastatin in the presence of FBS as a survival factor . The presence of apoptosis was evaluated by morphological criteria , annexin V binding , and DNA fragmentation and quantified as the proportion of hypodiploid cells by flow cytometry . DB01076 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner , an effect also seen with simvastatin and lovastatin , but not with the hydrophilic drug pravastatin . The proapoptotic effect of statins was seen only when the inhibition of acetate incorporation into sterols was > 95 % and was fully reversed by mevalonate , farnesyl pyrophosphate , and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by isopentenyl adenosine , ubiquinone , or squalene , suggesting a role for prenylated proteins in the regulation of VSMC apoptosis . To further assess the role of protein prenylation , VSMCs were exposed to the prenyl transferase inhibitors perillic acid and manumycin A . Both agents induced VSMC apoptosis as evaluated by the above-mentioned criteria . Finally , VSMC treatment with lipophilic statins was associated with decreased prenylation of P38936 -Rho B , further supporting the role of protein prenylation inhibition in statin-induced VSMC apoptosis . The present data suggest that interference with protein prenylation by P04035 inhibitors or other agents may provide new strategies for the prevention of neointimal thickening .
