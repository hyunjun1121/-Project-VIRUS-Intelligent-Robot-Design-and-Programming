DB00398 tosylate as a radiosensitizer in malignant astrocytoma . Progress in research on the molecular aspects of glioblastoma has yet to provide a medical therapy that significantly improves prognosis . Glioblastoma invariably progress through current treatment regimens with radiotherapy as a key component . Activation of several signaling pathways is thought to be associated with this resistance to radiotherapy . Ras activity is exceptionally high in glioblastoma and may regulate sensitivity to radiotherapy . P04049 , a downstream effector of Ras , demonstrates a high amount of activity in glioblastoma . Therefore , P04049 inhibition should be considered as a mechanism to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy in treatment regimen . In vitro analysis was performed with a novel P04049 kinase inhibitor ( BAY 54-9085 ) in culture with the glioblastoma cell line U1242 . The cell line was treated in serum-containing media and analyzed for the effect of the BAY 54-9085 alone and BAY 54-9085 combined with radiation on cell death . BAY 54-9085 displayed a cytocidal effect on glioblastoma cells following a 3 day incubation with the drug in serum-containing media . A dose of 2.5 μM displayed moderate cell death which significantly increased with a dose of 5.0 μM . In addition , glioblastoma cells treated with both the BAY 54-9085 and gamma radiation displayed a significant increase in cell death ( 85.5 % ) as compared to either BAY 54-9085 ( 73.1 % ) or radiation ( 34.4 % ) alone . Radiation therapy is a key component of treatment for glioblastoma . A novel P04049 inhibitor displayed in vitro evidence of synergistically increasing cell death of glioblastoma cells in combination with radiation .
