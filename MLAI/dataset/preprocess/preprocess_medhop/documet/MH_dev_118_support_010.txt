Lessons learned from the irinotecan metabolic pathway . DB00762 , a camptothecin analogue , is a prodrug which requires bioactivation to form the active metabolite SN-38 . SN-38 acts as a P11387 poison . DB00762 has been widely used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer , small cell lung cancer and several other solid tumors . However , large inter-patient variability in irinotecan and SN-38 disposition , as well as severe but unpredictable diarrhea limits the clinical potential of irinotecan . Intense clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to elucidate its complicated metabolic pathways and to provide scientific rationale in defining strategies to optimize drug therapy . DB00762 is subjected to be shunted between P08684 mediated oxidative metabolism to form two inactive metabolites P25054 or NPC and tissue carboxylesterase mediated hydrolysis to form SN-38 which is eventually detoxified via glucuronidation by P22309 to form SN-38G . The pharmacology of this compound is further complicated by the existence of genetic inter-individual differences in activation and deactivation enzymes of irinotecan ( e.g. , P08684 , P20815 , P22309 ) and sharing competitive elimination pathways with many concomitant medications , such as anticonvulsants , St . John 's Wort , and ketoconazole . Efflux of the parent compound and metabolites out of cells by several drug transporters ( e.g. , Pgp , Q9UNQ0 , MRP1 , Q92887 ) also occurs . This review highlights the latest findings in drug activation , transport mechanisms , glucuronidation , and CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions of irinotecan in order to unlock some of its complicated pharmacology and to provide ideas for relevant future studies into optimization of this promising agent .
