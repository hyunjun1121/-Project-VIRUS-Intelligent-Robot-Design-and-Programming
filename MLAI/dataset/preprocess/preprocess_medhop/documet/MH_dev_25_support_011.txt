Review : molecular pathology in adult high-grade gliomas : from molecular diagnostics to target therapies . The classification of malignant gliomas is moving from a morphology-based guide to a system built on molecular criteria . The development of a genomic landscape for gliomas and a better understanding of its functional consequences have led to the development of internally consistent molecular classifiers . However , development of a biologically insightful classification to guide therapy is still a work in progress . Response to targeted treatments is based not only on the presence of drugable targets , but rather on the molecular circuitry of the cells . Further , tumours are heterogeneous and change and adapt in response to drugs . Therefore , the challenge of developing molecular classifiers that provide meaningful ways to stratify patients for therapy remains a major challenge for the field . In this review , we examine the potential role of P16455 methylation , O75874 /2 mutations , 1p/19q deletions , aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3K pathways , abnormal p53/Rb pathways , cancer stem-cell markers and microRNAs as prognostic and predictive molecular markers in the setting of adult high-grade gliomas and we outline the clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma with genomic , transcriptomic and proteomic integrated analyses . Furthermore , we describe how these advances , especially in epidermal growth factor receptor/PI3K/ P42345 signalling pathway , affect our approaches towards targeted therapy , raising new challenges and identifying new leads .
