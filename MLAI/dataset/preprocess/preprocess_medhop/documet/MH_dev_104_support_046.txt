DB01240 -IP signaling and prostaglandin E2-EP2/EP4 signaling both mediate joint inflammation in mouse collagen-induced arthritis . Prostaglandin (PG)I2 ( prostacyclin [ P06744 ] ) and DB00917 are abundantly present in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients . Although the role of DB00917 in RA has been well studied , how much DB01240 contributes to RA is little known . To examine this issue , we backcrossed mice lacking the P43119 ( IP ) to the DBA/1J strain and subjected them to collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) . IP-deficient ( IP-/- ) mice exhibited significant reduction in arthritic scores compared with wild-type ( WT ) mice , despite anti-collagen antibody production and complement activation similar to WT mice . IP-/- mice also showed significant reduction in contents of proinflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin ( IL ) -6 in arthritic paws . Consistently , the addition of an IP agonist to cultured synovial fibroblasts significantly enhanced P05231 production and induced expression of other arthritis-related genes . On the other hand , loss or inhibition of each PGE receptor subtype alone did not affect elicitation of inflammation in CIA . However , a partial but significant suppression of CIA was achieved by the combined inhibition of EP2 and EP4 . Our results show significant roles of both DB01240 -IP and DB00917 -EP2/EP4 signaling in the development of CIA , and suggest that inhibition of DB00917 synthesis alone may not be sufficient for suppression of RA symptoms .
