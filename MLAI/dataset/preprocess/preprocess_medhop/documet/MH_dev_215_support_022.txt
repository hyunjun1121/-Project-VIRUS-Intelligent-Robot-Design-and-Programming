Pharmacokinetics of rofecoxib : a specific cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor . DB00533 is a commonly used specific cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor . DB00533 has high bioavailability , poor aqueous solubility , an elimination half-life suitable for daily administration and a volume of distribution approximating body mass . Species-specific , predominantly hepatic , metabolism occurs , with novel enterohepatic circulation in rats and O-glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase ( P78381 ) 2B7 and 2B15 in human liver microsomes . Discrepancies in studies of postoperative analgesia can be putatively explained by known pharmacokinetics . Changes in rofecoxib disposition and pharmacokinetics are evident between races , in elderly patients , in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment . Despite the selective action of P35354 inhibitors , there remains the potential for significant drug interactions . DB00533 has been shown to have interactions with rifampicin ( rifampin ) , warfarin , lithium and angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors and theophylline . P35354 inhibitors represent a major therapeutic advance in terms of gastrointestinal safety ; however , long-term safety in other organ systems and with concomitant drug administration still remain to be proven .
