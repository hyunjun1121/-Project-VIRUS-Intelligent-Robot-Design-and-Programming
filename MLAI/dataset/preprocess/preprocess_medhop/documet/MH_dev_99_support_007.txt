Effect of milk hydrolysates on inflammation markers and drug-induced transcriptional alterations in cell-based models . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) are associated with gastrointestinal inflammation and subsequent damage to the intestinal tissue . Earlier studies in our laboratory have found that specific casein hydrolysates ( CH ) might be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal wounds . The underlying mechanisms that support inflammation and wound healing are not completely understood , but transcriptional alterations may be used as markers for inflammation and wound healing . The bioactivity of 3 CH prepared by treatment of commercial casein with pepsin ( 60 min ) followed by corolase ( 0 , 10 , or 60 min ) were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells treated with the NSAID indomethacin . The bioactivity was evaluated as transcriptional alterations of transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( Q07869 -γ ) and nuclear factor κB ( NFκB ) by real-time PCR . Furthermore , the effect of CH on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation was evaluated in macrophages by measuring PG E(2) levels . Casein hydrolysates treated with corolase for 10 or 60 min after pepsin treatment downregulated transcription of TGF-β1 and NFκB ( P < 0.05 ) compared with the hydrolysate treated with pepsin only . Hydrolysate prepared by corolase treatment for 60 min after pepsin hydrolysis downregulated transcription of P35354 ( P < 0.05 ) compared with hydrolysate treated with corolase for only 10 min whereas transcription of Q07869 -γ was not affected ( P > 0.05 ) . Additionally , the hydrolysate prepared by pepsin treatment only ( 0 min corolase ) had a pro-inflammatory effect on macrophages via PG E(2) stimulation ( P < 0.05 ) . In conclusion , CH produced by a combination of pepsin and corolase treatments downregulated the transcription levels of TGF-β1 , P35354 , and NFκB .
