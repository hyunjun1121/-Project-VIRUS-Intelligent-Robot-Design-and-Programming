Identification of basophils as a major source of hepatocyte growth factor in chronic myeloid leukemia : a novel mechanism of P11274 - P00519 -independent disease progression . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) is a hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome and the related P11274 - P00519 oncoprotein . Acceleration of CML is usually accompanied by basophilia . Several proangiogenic molecules have been implicated in disease acceleration , including the hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) . However , little is known so far about the cellular distribution and function of P14210 in CML . We here report that P14210 is expressed abundantly in purified CML basophils and in the basophil-committed CML line KU812 , whereas all other cell types examined expressed only trace amounts of P14210 or no P14210 . Interleukin 3 , a major regulator of human basophils , was found to promote P14210 expression in CML basophils . By contrast , P11274 - P00519 failed to induce P14210 synthesis in CML cells , and imatinib failed to inhibit expression of P14210 in these cells . Recombinant P14210 as well as basophil-derived P14210 induced endothelial cell migration in a scratch wound assay , and these effects of P14210 were reverted by an anti- P14210 antibody as well as by pharmacologic c- DB00134 inhibitors . In addition , anti- P14210 and c- DB00134 inhibitors were found to suppress the spontaneous growth of KU812 cells , suggesting autocrine growth regulation . Together , P14210 is a P11274 - P00519 -independent angiogenic and autocrine growth regulator in CML . Basophils are a unique source of P14210 in these patients and may play a more active role in disease-associated angiogenesis and disease progression than has so far been assumed . Our data also suggest that P14210 and c- DB00134 are potential therapeutic targets in CML .
