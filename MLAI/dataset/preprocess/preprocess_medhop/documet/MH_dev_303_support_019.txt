Differential expression of cholesterol hydroxylases in Alzheimer 's disease . DB04540 is eliminated from neurons by oxidization , which generates oxysterols . DB04540 oxidation is mediated by the enzymes cholesterol 24-hydroxylase ( Q9Y6A2 ) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase ( Q02318 ) . Immunocytochemical studies show that Q9Y6A2 and Q02318 are expressed in neurons and some astrocytes in the normal brain , and Q02318 is present in oligodendrocytes . In Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , Q9Y6A2 shows prominent expression in astrocytes and around amyloid plaques , whereas Q02318 expression decreases in neurons and is not apparent around amyloid plaques but increases in oligodendrocytes . Although previous studies have examined the effects of synthetic oxysterols on the processing of amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) , the actions of the naturally occurring oxysterols have yet to be examined . To understand the role of cholesterol oxidation in AD , we compared the effects of 24(S)- and 27-hydroxycholesterol on the processing of P05067 and analyzed the cell-specific expression patterns of the two cholesterol hydroxylases in the human brain . Both oxysterols inhibited production of Abeta in neurons , but 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was approximately 1000-fold more potent than 27-hydroxycholesterol . The IC(50) of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for inhibiting Abeta secretion was approximately 1 nm . Both oxysterols induced O95477 expression with IC(50) values similar to that for inhibition of A beta secretion , suggesting the involvement of liver X receptor . Oxysterols also inhibited protein kinase C activity and P05067 secretion following stimulation of protein kinase C . The selective expression of Q9Y6A2 around neuritic plaques and the potent inhibition of P05067 processing in neurons by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol suggests that Q9Y6A2 affects the pathophysiology of AD and provides insight into how polymorphisms in the Q9Y6A2 gene might influence the pathophysiology of this prevalent disease .
