Transcriptional alterations of ET-1 axis and DNA damage in lung tissue of a rat obesity model . Obesity has been implicated in the development of many cancers . This can lead to genome damage , especially in the form of double-strand break , the presence of which is now easily detected through nuclear phosphorylation of histone P16104 ( γ- P16104 ) focus assay . Recently , the endothelin ( ET ) axis has also been shown to have a role in the growth and progression of several tumors , including lung cancer . The aim of this study was to evaluate the ET-1 system transcriptional alterations and γ- P16104 in lung tissue of Zucker rats subdivided into obese ( O , n=22 ) and controls ( CO , n=18 ) rats : under either fasting conditions ( CO(fc)-O(fc) ) or acute hyperglycemia ( CO(AH)-O(AH) ) . Significantly higher prepro-ET-1 ( p=0.05 ) and ET-converting enzyme ( ECE ) -2 mRNA expression was observed in O with respect to CO . A significant positive association was observed between prepro-ET-1 and P25101 in the whole rat population ( p=0.009 ) or in the obese group alone ( p=0.007 ) . The levels of γ- P16104 in O and in O(AH) rats were significantly higher ( p=0.019 ) than in the corresponding CO and CO(AH) rats ( p=0.038 ) . The study shows an inappropriate secretion of ET-1 in O animals with a parallel DNA damage in their lungs , providing novel mechanisms by which ET receptor antagonist may exert organ protection .
