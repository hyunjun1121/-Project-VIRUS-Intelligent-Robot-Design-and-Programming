T lymphocytes potentiate endogenous neuroprotective inflammation in a mouse model of P35858 . Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( P35858 ) is an adult-onset , progressive , motor neuron degenerative disease , in which the role of inflammation is not well established . Innate and adaptive immunity were investigated in the CNS of the Superoxide Dismutase 1 ( P00441 ) (G93A) transgenic mouse model of P35858 . P01730 + and CD8+ T cells infiltrated P00441 (G93A) spinal cords during disease progression . Cell-specific flow cytometry and gene expression profiling showed significant phenotypic changes in microglia , including dendritic cell receptor acquisition , and expression of genes linked to neuroprotection , cholesterol metabolism and tissue remodeling . Microglia dramatically up-regulated DB01277 and down-regulated P05231 expression . When mutant P00441 mice were bred onto a TCRbeta deficient background , disease progression was significantly accelerated at the symptomatic stage . In addition , microglia reactivity and DB01277 levels were reduced in spinal cords of P00441 (G93A) ( TCRbeta-/- ) mice . These results indicate that T cells play an endogenous neuroprotective role in P35858 by modulating a beneficial inflammatory response to neuronal injury .
