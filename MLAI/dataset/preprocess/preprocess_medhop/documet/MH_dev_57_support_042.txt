Overexpression of Q14849 in human monocyte/macrophages induces an anti-atherogenic lipid phenotype . Dysregulated macrophage cholesterol homoeostasis lies at the heart of early and developing atheroma , and removal of excess cholesterol from macrophage foam cells , by efficient transport mechanisms , is central to stabilization and regression of atherosclerotic lesions . The present study demonstrates that transient overexpression of Q14849 { START [ P49675 ( steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ) -related lipid transfer ] domain 3 ; also known as Q14849 ( metastatic lymph node 64 ) } , an endosomal cholesterol transporter and member of the ' START ' family of lipid trafficking proteins , induces significant increases in macrophage O95477 ( DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ) mRNA and protein , enhances [(3)H]cholesterol efflux to apo ( apolipoprotein ) AI , and reduces biosynthesis of cholesterol , cholesteryl ester , fatty acids , triacylglycerol and phospholipids from [(14)C]acetate , compared with controls . Notably , overexpression of Q14849 prevents increases in cholesterol esterification in response to acetylated LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ) , blocking cholesteryl ester deposition . Thus enhanced endosomal trafficking via Q14849 induces an anti-atherogenic macrophage lipid phenotype , positing a potentially therapeutic strategy .
