Marine invertebrates cross phyla comparisons reveal highly conserved immune machinery . Naturally occurring histocompatibility responses , following tissue-to-tissue allogeneic contacts , are common among numerous colonial marine invertebrate taxa , including sponges , cnidarians , bryozoans and ascidians . These responses , often culminating in either tissue fusions or rejections , activate a wide array of innate immune components . By comparing two allorejection EST libraries , developed from alloincompatible challenged colonies of the stony coral Stylophora pistillata and the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri , we revealed a common basis for innate immunity in these two evolutionary distant species . Two prominent genes within this common basis were the immunophilins , P62937 ( CypA ) and FK506-binding protein ( FKBP ) . In situ hybridizations revealed that mRNA expression of the coral and ascidian immunophilins was restricted to specific allorecognition effector cell populations ( nematoblasts and nematocytes in the coral and morula cells in the ascidian ) . The expressions were limited to only some of the effector cells within a population , disclosing disparities in numbers and location between na√Øve colonies and their immune challenged counterparts . Administration of the immunosuppression drug DB00091 -A during ascidian 's allogeneic assays inhibited both fusion and rejection reactions , probably through the inhibition of ascidian 's immunocytes ( morula cells ) movement and activation . Our results , together with previous published data , depict an immunophilins-based immune mechanism , which is similarly activated in allogeneic responses of distantly related animals from sponges to humans .
