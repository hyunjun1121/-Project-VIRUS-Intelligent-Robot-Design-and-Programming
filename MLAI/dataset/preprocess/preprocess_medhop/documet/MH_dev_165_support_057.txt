DB01268 in advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma : evidence of a direct antitumor effect . BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to confirm sunitinib activity in alveolar soft part sarcoma ( ASPS ) and to report on new insights into the molecular bases thereof . PATIENTS AND METHODS : From July 2007 , nine patients with progressive metastatic ASPS received sunitinib 37.5 mg/day , within a named use program . Cryopreserved material was available for five naive patients , among whom three received sunitinib . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) /confocal microscopy , biochemical , and molecular/cytogenetic analyses were carried out , complemented by antiproliferative and activation assays in a short-term culture derived from one case . RESULTS : All patients were eligible for response . Best RECIST response was partial response in five cases , stable disease in three , and progression in one . The median progression-free survival was 17 months . Positron emission tomography results were consistent . Two cases of interval progressions were recorded . Antiproliferative assays and biochemistry on short-term culture showed that sunitinib is able to markedly impair ASPS cells growth and switch-off P09619 . IF/confocal microscopy demonstrated coexpression and physical association between P09619 /vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( P35968 ) and P07949 / P35968 in ASPS cells , which was validated by biochemistry . P09619 , P07949 , and MET ligand-dependent activation was confirmed . CONCLUSIONS : We confirm the clinical efficacy of sunitinib in ASPS , mediated by P09619 , P35968 , and P07949 , which are all expressed in tumor cells . A direct antitumor effect was shown in a short-term cell culture .
