American DB01404 inhibits induced P35354 and NFKB activation in breast cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic evidence suggests reduced breast cancer mortality in users of American DB01404 ( AG ) ( Panax quinquefolium ) . We hypothesized that AG extract decreases proliferation of human breast cancer cells via an anti-inflammatory effect applicable to the prevention of breast and other cancers . MATERIAL AND METHODS : A defined lyophilized aqueous extract of AG ( LEAG ) was dissolved in DB01093 1mg/mL , and serially diluted in saline . The cell lines MDA MB 231 and MCF7 were stimulated with the phorbol ester PDBu and treated with 100-500 mcg/mL LEAG . Proliferation was measured by MDA assay . Induced P35354 expression was assayed by ELISA . Activation of NFkappaB by phosphorylation of the p65 subunit was quantified by CASE ( cellular activation of signaling ELISA ) . RESULTS : Both cell lines had reduced proliferation when treated with LEAG . PDBu stimulation of MDA MB 231 increased expression of the P35354 protein 20-fold at 48 hours ( P < 0.005 ) . P35354 protein expression remained at baseline concentrations in PDBu- treated MDA MB 231 cells exposed to 100 mcg/mL LEAG . The CASE assay showed a 4-fold increase in p65 activation 24 hours after PDBu treatment in normal medium , while phosphorylated p65 dropped below baseline in the cells treated with PDBu plus LEAG . CONCLUSION : In MDA MB 231 , P35354 was inducible with PDBu . This induced P35354 expression was blocked by 100 microgram/mL LEAG in a time course consistent with the decline in the activated p65 subunit of NFkappaB . These results provide an anti-inflammatory mechanism for a possible anti-cancer effect of American DB01404 .
