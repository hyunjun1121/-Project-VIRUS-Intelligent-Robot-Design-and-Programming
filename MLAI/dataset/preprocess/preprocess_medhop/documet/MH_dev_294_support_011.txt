Modulation by cytokines of glucocorticoid action . Glucocorticoids ( GC ) are potent modulators of the inflammatory response . Their effects serve to down-regulate the inflammatory response and are mediated by genomic pathways that follow the interaction with specific receptors ( glucocorticoid receptors , GR ) . Interleukin ( IL ) -1 , P60568 , and P05231 are able to increase GC secretion by enhancing synthesis and release of P06850 and DB01285 . Cytokine effects upon steroidogenesis also occur at the adrenal level . The role of cytokines as modulators of GR has received scarce attention . IL-1 has been shown to up-regulate GR mRNA expression in hypothalamic P06850 secreting cells . On the other hand , macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) , a T-cell product inducible by inflammatory substances including other cytokines , counterregulates GC action within the immune system . Besides immunocytes and neurons , bone cells are a sensitive target for GC and cytokines . We have found that P60568 and P05231 up-regulate remarkably the number of GR binding sites and the expression of GR mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells . Available data suggest that inflammatory cytokines have both direct and indirect effects on GC action at the target level . Autocrine-induced transcription of GR in immunocytes and/or osteoblasts could be a mechanism that restrains excess cytokine production .
