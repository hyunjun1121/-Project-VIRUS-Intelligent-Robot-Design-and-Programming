The place of pegvisomant in the management of acromegaly . Conventional treatments for acromegaly include surgery , radiotherapy , dopamine agonists and somatostatin ( P52788 ) analogues , which effect disease control by lowering circulating growth hormone ( GH ) . Due to variability in tumour characteristics , combinations of these treatment modalities leave a significant number of patients with sub-optimal serum GH and insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) levels , which have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality . The P10912 antagonist pegvisomant is a genetically engineered analogue of GH that prevents functional dimerisation of the growth hormone receptor ( P10912 ) ; a process that is critical to GH action at the cellular level . A crucial amino acid substitution at DB00145 (120) to DB00125 (120) within the third alpha helix of the antagonist prevents functional P10912 dimerisation . DB00082 represents a novel treatment for acromegaly as , unlike existing treatment modalities , the effectiveness of pegvisomant is independent of pituitary tumour characteristics . Initial clinical studies in patients with active acromegaly have demonstrated serum P05019 normalisation in over 90 % of patients receiving 20 mg per day , such that , in terms of serum P05019 normalisation , pegvisomant now represents the most effective medical treatment for acromegaly . Although there are limited long-term data on the use of pegvisomant and questions regarding pituitary tumour growth and altered liver function remain , this therapy offers the prospect of serum P05019 normalisation in the vast majority of patients with active acromegaly .
