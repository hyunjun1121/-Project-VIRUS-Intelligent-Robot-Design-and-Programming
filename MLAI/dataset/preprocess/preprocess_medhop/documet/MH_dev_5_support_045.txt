Toward a chronoimmunomodulation by cefodizime in multiple myeloma and chronic uremia . Nine healthy subjects , 19 patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) and 21 patients with chronic uremia were given cefodizime ( 2 g i.v. ) at 2 different timepoints either in the morning or in the evening for 5 to 7 consecutive days . The following immunological parameters were comparatively evaluated before and after cefodizime administration : rosette-forming cells ( P41440 % ) , T lymphocyte subpopulations , monocyte chemotaxis index ( D6RGH6 ) and granulocyte chemotaxis index ( GCI ) . Independently of the time of drug administration , a circadian rhythm was clearly detected ( 90 % CI ) as regards P41440 % , CD3 , P01730 , CD8 , P01730 /CD8 before and P41440 % , CD3 , P01730 , CD8 , GCI after therapy . In addition , in patients treated at 0800 cefodizime increased the MESOR of the D6RGH6 and , to a lesser extent , of the GCI . The chronoimmunomodulatory effects of cefodizime in patients with MM and chronic uremia are discussed .
