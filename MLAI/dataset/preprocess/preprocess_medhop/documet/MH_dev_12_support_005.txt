Systematic meta-analyses and field synopsis of genetic association studies in schizophrenia : the SzGene database . In an effort to pinpoint potential genetic risk factors for schizophrenia , research groups worldwide have published over 1,000 genetic association studies with largely inconsistent results . To facilitate the interpretation of these findings , we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies for schizophrenia ( ' SzGene ' ) . For all polymorphisms having genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples , we systematically carried out random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts . Across 118 meta-analyses , a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes ( P02649 , P21964 , DAO , P21728 , P14416 , P21917 , Q96EV8 , P47870 , Q13224 , HP , P01584 , P42898 , O75051 , P31645 , P04637 and P17752 ) showed nominally significant effects with average summary odds ratios of approximately 1.23 . Seven of these variants had not been previously meta-analyzed . According to recently proposed criteria for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic association studies , four of the significant results can be characterized as showing ' strong ' epidemiological credibility . Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource for systematically synthesized and graded evidence of genetic association studies in schizophrenia . As such , it could serve as a model for field synopses of genetic associations in other common and genetically complex disorders .
