DB01098 reduces neointima formation in a rat model of balloon injury . BACKGROUND : Processes of restenosis , following arterial injury , are complex involving different cell types producing various cytokines and enzymes . Among those enzymes , smooth muscle cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are thought to take part in cell migration , degrading of extracellular matrix , and neointima formation . P14780 , also known as gelatinase B , is expressed immediately after vascular injury and its expression and activity can be inhibited by statins . Using an established in vivo model of vascular injury , we investigated the effect of the P04035 inhibitor rosuvastatin on P14780 expression and neointima formation . MATERIALS AND METHODS : 14-week old male Sprague Dawley rats underwent balloon injury of the common carotid artery . Half of the animals received rosuvastatin ( 20 mg/kg body weight/day ) via oral gavage , beginning 3 days prior to injury . Gelatinase activity and neointima formation were analyzed 3 days and 14 days after balloon injury , respectively . 14 days after vascular injury , proliferative activity was assessed by staining for Ki67 . RESULTS : After 14 days , animals in the rosuvastatin group showed a decrease in total neointima formation ( 0.194±0.01 mm2 versus 0.124±0.02 mm2 , p < 0.05 ) as well as a reduced intima/media ratio ( 1.26±0.1 versus 0.75±0.09 , p < 0.05 ) . Balloon injury resulted in increased activity of P14780 3 days after intervention for both rosuvastatin treated animals and controls with no significant difference observed between the groups . There was a trend towards a reduction in the number of Ki67-positive cells 14 days after injury . CONCLUSIONS : DB01098 attenuates neointima formation without affecting early P14780 activity in a rat model of vascular injury .
