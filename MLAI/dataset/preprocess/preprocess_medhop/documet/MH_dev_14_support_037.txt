Negative feedback regulation between microRNA let-7g and the oxLDL receptor P78380 . Lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) is a surface scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) . Several transcription factors have been reported to regulate P78380 expression . MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression , but there have been no reports of P78380 expression being regulated by microRNAs . Because the microRNA let-7g has been predicted to bind to P78380 mRNA , we investigated whether let-7g can regulate P78380 expression . Our experiments first demonstrated that oxLDL can reduce let-7g expression . We later confirmed that there is a let-7g binding site on the 3'-untranslated region of P78380 mRNA . We showed that intracellular Ca(2+)-activated protein kinase C is involved in the oxLDL- P78380 -let-7g pathway . Bioinformatics predicted that the let-7g promoter has a binding site for the transcriptional repressor O75051 -1 . We used a promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation to confirm this binding . Consequently , knockdown of O75051 -1 was found to increase let-7g expression . Transfection of let-7g inhibited oxLDL-induced P78380 and O75051 -1 expression , cell proliferation and migration . Mice fed with a high-fat diet showed a decrease in let-7g and an increase in P78380 and O75051 -1 . A study on humans showed the serum levels of let-7g are lower in subjects with hypercholesterolemia compared with normal controls . Our findings identify a negative feedback regulation between let-7g and P78380 , and indicate that let-7g could be a target to treat cardiovascular disease .
