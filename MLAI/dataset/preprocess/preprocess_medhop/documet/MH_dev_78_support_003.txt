Nonsteroidal anti-Inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular risk . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) inhibit cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) enzymes , which exist in at least two isoforms , P23219 and P35354 . DB00945 and older agents in this class are nonselective inhibitors of both P23219 and P35354 . Newer agents termed " coxibs " are selective inhibitors of P35354 . Among the NSAID , only aspirin has been proven to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk , primarily through inhibition of P23219 -mediated platelet aggregation . It has been suggested that other nonselective agents , especially naproxen , may provide some lesser degree of cardioprotection , but conclusive evidence is lacking . Conversely , there are concerns that the P35354 inhibitors may increase cardiovascular risk . However , mechanisms for this potentially adverse cardiovascular effect are unknown , and it is becoming increasingly clear that our understanding of the role of P35354 in cardiovascular function is incomplete . Some studies have demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of P35354 on cardiovascular function that could be negated by P35354 inhibition , while other studies have reported improved endothelial function with P35354 inhibitors . Additionally , the impact of combined therapy with aspirin and other P36551 inhibitors is not yet clear . This article will review the studies that have examined these issues .
