Antiapoptotic effect of endothelin-1 in rat cardiomyocytes in vitro . Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes is thought to be a feature of many pathological disorders , including congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . Because recent investigations indicate that endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) plays an important role in CHF and IHD , we investigated the effect of ET-1 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis . The presence of apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes ( H9c2 and neonatal ) was evaluated by morphological criteria , electrophoresis of DNA fragments , 4',6'-diamidine-2'-phenylindole staining , and TUNEL analysis . ET-1 , but not angiotensin II , prevented apoptosis induced by serum deprivation via P25101 receptors in a dose-dependent manner ( 1 to 100 nmol/L ) . ET-1 also prevented cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol . The use of specific pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that the antiapoptotic effect of ET-1 was mediated through a tyrosine kinase pathway ( genistein and AG490 ) but not through protein kinase C ( PKC ; calphostin C ) , mitogen-activated protein kinases ( PD98059 and SB203580 ) , or PKA ( KT5270 ) pathways . Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of kinase-inactive ( KI ) c-Src reversed the antiapoptotic effect of ET-1 . We further investigated whether Bcl-xL , an antiapoptotic molecule , would be upregulated by using a luciferase-based reporter system . ET-1 upregulated Bcl-xL , and this upregulation was inhibited by genistein or AG490 but not by calphostin C . The experiments with KI mutants for various tyrosine kinases revealed that c-Src and Pyk2 ( but not P23458 , Jak2 , Syk , and Tec ) are involved in ET-1-induced upregulation of Bcl-xL expression . These findings suggest that ET-1 prevents apoptosis in cardiac myocytes through the P25101 receptor and the subsequent c-Src/Bcl-xL-dependent pathway .
