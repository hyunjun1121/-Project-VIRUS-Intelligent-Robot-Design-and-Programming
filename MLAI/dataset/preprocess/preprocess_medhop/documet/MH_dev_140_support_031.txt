Strategic combination therapy overcomes tyrosine kinase coactivation in adrenocortical carcinoma . BACKGROUND : Coactivation of tyrosine kinase limits the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors . We hypothesized that a strategic combination therapy could overcome tyrosine kinase coactivation and compensatory oncogenic signaling in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) . METHODS : We profiled 88 tyrosine kinases before and after treatment with sunitinib in H295R and SW13 ACC cells . The effects of monotherapy and strategic combination regimens were determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium ( ie , MTS ) assay . RESULTS : The minimum inhibitory concentrations ( IC(min) ) of sunitinib quenched its primary targets : P36888 , P35968 , and P07949 . In contrast , P29323 , P08631 , Chk2 , P07947 , CREB , MEK , MSK , p38 , P09769 , and P30530 were hyperactivated . Monotherapy with sunitinib or PD98059 at their IC(min) reduced proliferation by 23 % and 19 % , respectively , in H295R cells and by 25 % and 24 % , respectively , in SW13 cells . DB01268 and PD98059 in combination decreased proliferation by 68 % and 64 % in H295R and in SW13 cells , respectively ( P < .05 versus monotherapy ) . The effects of combination treatment exceeded the sum of the effects observed with each individual agent alone . CONCLUSION : We describe the first preclinical model to develop strategic combination therapy to overcome tyrosine kinase coactivation in ACC . Because many tyrosine kinase inhibitors are readily available , this model can be immediately tested in clinical trials for patients with advanced ACC .
