Pharmacology of recombinant low-voltage activated calcium channels . Several types of voltage- or ligand-activated calcium channels contribute to the excitability of neuronal cells . Low-voltage-activated ( LVA ) , T-type calcium channels are characterised by relatively negative threshold of activation and therefore they can generate low-threshold spikes , which are essential for burst firing . At least three different proteins form T-type calcium current in neurons : Ca(v)3.1 , Ca(v)3.2 and Q9P0X4 . Expression of these proteins in various brain regions is complementary . Individual channel types could be distinguished by different sensitivity towards inorganic cations . This inhibition can contribute to the toxicity of some heavy metals . Selective inhibition of T-type calcium channels by organic blockers may have clinical importance in some forms of epilepsy . DB01388 inhibits the expressed Ca(v2)3.1 , Ca(v)3.2 and Q9P0X4 channels in nanomolar concentrations with Q9P0X4 channel having lowest affinity . The sensitivity of the expressed Ca(v)3.1 channel to the antiepileptic drugs , valproate and ethosuximide , is low . Ca(v)3.1 channel is moderately sensitive to phenytoin . The Ca(v)3.2 channel is sensitive to ethosuximide , amlodipine and amiloride . All three LVA calcium channels are moderately sensitive to active metabolites of methosuximide , i.e. alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccinimide . Several neuroleptics inhibit all three LVA channels in clinically relevant concentrations . All three channels are also inhibited by the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide . A high affinity peptide blocker for these Ca channels is the scorpion toxin kurtoxin which inhibits the Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Q9P0X4 channel in nanomolar concentrations . DB06690 selectively inhibits the Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Ca(v)3.1 channel . The Ca(v)3.2 , but not the Ca(v)3.1 channel is potentiated by stimulation of Ca(2+)/ P62158 -dependent protein kinase .
