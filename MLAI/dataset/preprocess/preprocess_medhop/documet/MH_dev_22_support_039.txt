P04626 -family signalling mechanisms , clinical implications and targeting in breast cancer . Approximately 20 % of human breast cancers ( BC ) overexpress P04626 protein , and P04626 -positivity is associated with a worse prognosis . Although P04626 -targeted therapies have significantly improved outcomes for P04626 -positive BC patients , resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy remains a clinical problem . In order to better understand resistance to P04626 -targeted therapies in P04626 -positive BC , it is necessary to examine HER family signalling as a whole . An extensive literature search was carried out to critically assess the current knowledge of HER family signalling in P04626 -positive BC and response to P04626 -targeted therapy . Known mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance include reduced receptor-antibody binding ( Q99102 , p95HER2 ) , increased signalling through alternative HER family receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) , altered intracellular signalling involving loss of P60484 , reduced p27kip1 , or increased PI3K/AKT activity and altered signalling via non-HER family RTKs such as P08069 . Emerging strategies to circumvent resistance to P04626 -targeted therapies in P04626 -positive BC include co-targeting P04626 /PI3K , pan-HER family inhibition , and novel therapies such as DB05773 . There is evidence that immunity plays a key role in the efficacy of HER-targeted therapy , and efforts are being made to exploit the immune system in order to improve the efficacy of current anti-HER therapies . With our rapidly expanding understanding of P04626 signalling mechanisms along with the repertoire of HER family and other targeted therapies , it is likely that the near future holds further dramatic improvements to the prognosis of women with P04626 -positive BC .
