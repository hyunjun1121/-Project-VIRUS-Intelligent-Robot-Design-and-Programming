Cannabinoid agonists but not inhibitors of endogenous cannabinoid transport or metabolism enhance the reinforcing efficacy of heroin in rats . Accumulating evidence suggests that the endogenous cannabinoid system is involved in the reinforcing effects of heroin . In rats intravenously self-administering heroin , we investigated effects of cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonists and compounds that block transport or metabolism of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide . The natural cannnabinoid P21554 receptor agonist DB00470 ( THC , 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p. ) did not alter self-administration of heroin under a fixed-ratio one ( FR1 ) schedule , except at a high 3 mg/kg dose which decreased heroin self-administration . Under a progressive-ratio schedule , however , THC dose-dependently increased the number of 50 mug/kg heroin injections self-administered per session and the maximal ratio completed ( break-point ) , with peak increases at 1 mg/kg THC . In addition , 1 mg/kg THC increased break-points and injections self-administered over a wide range of heroin injection doses ( 25-100 microg/kg ) , indicating an increase in heroin 's reinforcing efficacy and not its potency . The synthetic cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 ( 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p. ) had effects similar to THC under the progressive-ratio schedule . In contrast , AM-404 ( 1-10 mg/kg i.p. ) , an inhibitor of transport of anandamide , and Q76M96 -597 ( 0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.p. ) , an inhibitor of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) that degrades anandamide , or their combination , did not increase reinforcing efficacy of heroin at any dose tested . Thus , activation of cannabinoid P21554 receptors facilitates the reinforcing efficacy of heroin and this appears to be mediated by interactions between cannabinoid P21554 receptors and mu-opioid receptors and their signaling pathways , rather than by an opioid-induced release of endogenous cannabinoids .
