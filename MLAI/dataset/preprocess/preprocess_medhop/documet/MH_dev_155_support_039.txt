Augmentation by citalopram of risperidone-induced monoamine release in rat prefrontal cortex . RATIONALE : A typical antipsychotics ( APDs ) , e.g. olanzapine and risperidone , have been reported to be effective adjunctive treatment for depression if selective serotonin ( 5-HT ) reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) alone are ineffective . OBJECTIVES AND METHODS : We utilized microdialysis in awake , freely moving rats to study the effect of risperidone in combination with citalopram , an SSRI , on extracellular 5-HT , dopamine ( DA ) , and norepinephrine ( NE ) efflux in rat medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) . RESULTS : DB00734 ( 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. ) , given alone , significantly increased 5-HT , DA , and NE concentrations in the mPFC . DB00215 ( 10 mg/kg , s.c. ) , by itself , produced a significant increase in 5-HT levels only . The combination of risperidone and citalopram produced significantly greater increases in efflux of both DA and NE than risperidone alone . However , the effect of this combination on extracellular 5-HT concentrations was not significantly different than that of citalopram alone . The augmentation of DA and NE efflux induced by risperidone plus citalopram could be partially blocked by the selective P08908 antagonist , WAY 100635 ( 0.2 mg/kg , s.c. ) . CONCLUSIONS : The results suggest that the ability of atypical APDs to augment the therapeutic efficacy of SSRIs in major depression and treatment-resistant depression may be due , at least in part , to potentiation of SSRI-induced increases in cortical DA and NE . The contributions of P08908 receptor stimulation and 5- Q13049 and alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonism to this augmentation are discussed .
