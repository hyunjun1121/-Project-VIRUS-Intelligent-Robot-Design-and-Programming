Efficacy and safety of vilazodone 20 and 40 mg in major depressive disorder : a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . DB06684 is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and P08908 partial agonist approved for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) treatment in adults . This was a 10-week , multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled and active-controlled , fixed-dose trial ( NCT01473381 ) . Adult patients with MDD ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th ed. , text revision criteria ) were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to vilazodone 20 or 40 mg/day , citalopram 40 mg/day , or placebo . Primary efficacy : Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) ; secondary efficacy : Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and sustained response ( MADRS total score≤12 for at least the last two consecutive double-blind visits ) . The intent-to-treat population comprised 1133 patients , ( placebo=281 ; vilazodone 20 mg/day=288 ; vilazodone 40 mg/day=284 ; citalopram=280 ) . MADRS and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity score change from baseline to week 10 was significantly greater for vilazodone 20 mg/day , vilazodone 40 mg/day , and citalopram versus placebo . Sustained response rates were numerically higher , but not significantly different , in all active treatment groups versus placebo . The most common adverse events ( ≥5 % of vilazodone patients , twice the rate of placebo ) were diarrhea , nausea , vomiting ( vilazodone 40 mg/day only ) , and insomnia . Improved sexual function ( Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire scores ) was seen in all groups ; between-group differences were not significant . DB06684 20 and 40 mg/day demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of MDD .
