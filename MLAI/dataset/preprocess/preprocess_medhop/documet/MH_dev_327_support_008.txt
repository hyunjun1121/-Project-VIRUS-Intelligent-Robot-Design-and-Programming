P22309 *28 is associated with greater decrease in serum K⁺ levels following oral intake of procaterol . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : DB01366 is a potent β2-agonist frequently used for the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The efficacy and adverse effects of β2-agonists are heterogeneous in individual patients , which may be partly caused by genetic variations in metabolizing enzymes and receptor molecules . The present study was designed to analyze the relationship between gene polymorphisms and physiological effects of procaterol in healthy subjects . METHODS : Ninety-two non-smoking healthy volunteers were given 1 µg/kg body weight ( max 50 µg ) of procaterol as a dry syrup preparation , and the serum concentrations of procaterol , serum K(+) , and the physical responses were monitored for 240 min . We genotyped β2-adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) ( Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu ) , cytochrome P450 3A4 ( rs2246709 , rs4646437 ) , and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( P22309 ) ( rs4148323 [ allele A , *6 ] , rs12479045 , rs4148328 , rs4663971 , rs12052787 , rs4148329 , A (TA)6/7 TAA [ seven-repeat allele , *28 ] ) . DB01366 concentrations in serum were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . RESULTS : No gene polymorphisms affected serum procaterol concentrations . Meanwhile , overall serum K(+) level changes were significantly lower in carriers of P22309 *28 than in non-carriers after correcting for strong effects of serum procaterol concentrations and baseline K(+) levels . No other polymorphisms were associated with serum K(+) levels . None of polymorphisms of P07550 were associated with any physical responses . CONCLUSION : The present study indicates that significant hypokalemia may occur in carriers of P22309 *28 by systemic administration of procaterol and potentially by other β2-agonists metabolized in the liver .
