P01375 alpha mediates GABA(A) receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane of spinal cord neurons in vivo . The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα contributes to cell death in central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders by altering synaptic neurotransmission . TNFα contributes to excitotoxicity by increasing P42262 -lacking AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) trafficking to the neuronal plasma membrane . In vitro , increased AMPAR on the neuronal surface after TNFα exposure is associated with a rapid internalization of GABA(A) receptors ( GABA(A)Rs ) , suggesting complex timing and dose dependency of the CNS 's response to TNFα . However , the effect of TNFα on GABA(A)R trafficking in vivo remains unclear . We assessed the effect of TNFα nanoinjection on rapid GABA(A)R changes in rats ( N = 30 ) using subcellular fractionation , quantitative western blotting , and confocal microscopy . GABA(A)R protein levels in membrane fractions of TNFα and vehicle-treated subjects were not significantly different by Western Blot , yet high-resolution quantitative confocal imaging revealed that TNFα induces GABA(A)R trafficking to synapses in a dose-dependent manner by 60 min . TNFα-mediated GABA(A)R trafficking represents a novel target for CNS excitotoxicity .
