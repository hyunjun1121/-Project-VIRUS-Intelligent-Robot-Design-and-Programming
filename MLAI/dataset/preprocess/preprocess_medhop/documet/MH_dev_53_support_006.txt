P49146 deletion attenuates the type 2 diabetic syndrome of ob/ob mice . Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) is implicated in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions , notably energy homeostasis and reproduction . Chronically elevated P01303 levels in the hypothalamus , as in genetically obese ob/ob mice , are associated with obesity , a syndrome of type 2 diabetes , and infertility . However , it is not known which of the five cloned Y receptors mediate these effects . Here , we show that crossing the P49146 knockout mouse ( P28062 (-/-) ) onto the ob/ob background attenuates the increased adiposity , hyperinsulinemia , hyperglycemia , and increased hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis activity of ob/ob mice . Compared with lean controls , ob/ob mice had elevated expression of P01303 and agouti-related protein ( AgRP ) mRNA in the arcuate nucleus and decreased expression of proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ( Q16568 ) mRNA . P28062 deletion in ob/ob mice significantly increased the hypothalamic P01189 mRNA expression , with no effect on P01303 , AgRP , or Q16568 expression . [ P28062 (-/-)ob/ob ] mice were no different from ob/ob littermates with respect to food intake and body weight , and P49146 deficiency had no beneficial effect on the infertility or the reduced hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadotropic function of ob/ob mice . These data demonstrate that P28062 receptors mediate the obese type 2 diabetes phenotype of ob/ob mice , possibly via alterations in melanocortin tonus in the arcuate nucleus and/or effects on the Q9Y251 axis .
