Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone ( P01148 ) -I antagonist cetrorelix inhibits myeloma cell growth in vitro and in vivo . The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) -I antagonist , DB00050 , on human multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells and to elucidate the mechanisms of action . We showed that P01148 -I and P22888 -I genes were expressed in MM cell lines and primary MM cells . Treatment with DB00050 inhibited growth and colony-forming ability of myeloma cells , including cell lines resistant to arsenic trioxide , bortezomib , or lenalidomide . DB00050 induced apoptosis in myeloma cells including primary myeloma cells . In addition , DB00050 inhibited the growth of human myeloma cells xenografted into mice without any apparent side effects . DB00050 downregulated the nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-ÎºB ) pathway activity and the expression of cytokines , including interleukin 6 , insulin-like growth factor 1 , P15692 , and stromal-derived factor 1 , important for myeloma cell growth and survival in myeloma cells and/or marrow stromal cells from myeloma patients . DB00050 decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and P40763 in myeloma cells , two crucial pathways for myeloma cells growth and survival . Moreover , the expression of P38936 and p53 was increased , whereas that of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) was reduced by DB00050 . Our findings indicate that DB00050 induces cytotoxicity in myeloma cells through various mechanisms and provide a rationale for investigating DB00050 for the treatment of MM .
