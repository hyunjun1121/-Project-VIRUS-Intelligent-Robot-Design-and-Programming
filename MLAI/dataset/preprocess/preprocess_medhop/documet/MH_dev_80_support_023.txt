[ Endocrinologic side effects of oncologic treatment with anti- P16410 -antibodies ] . New immune-modulating treatments like the anti- P16410 -antibodies-based therapies are increasingly used in medical oncology . The action of DB06186 , a monoclonal anti- P16410 -antibody used for the treatment of metastasized melanoma and other solid tumors , is well documented . Blocking the P16410 -receptors on lymphocytes leads to T-cell activation and hence reduction of the tumor-mediated immunotolerance . This mechanism constitutes the basis of the antiproliferative effects but is also responsible for a spectrum of specific adverse events ( immune-related adverse events , IRAE ) . IRAE of the endocrine system comprise hypophysitis , thyroiditis and adrenalitis . Especially adrenal insufficiency can be fatal when not diagnosed and treated . Symptoms often are unspecific and early diagnosis and targeted treatment are crucial . We present a case report and summarize - based upon the current literature - the diagnosis and treatment of endocrinologic IRAEs .
