Phenotypic and molecular evaluation of a chromosome 1q region with linkage and association to type 2 diabetes in humans . OBJECTIVE : Linkage to type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is well replicated on chromosome 1q21-q23 . Within this region , T2D was associated with common single nucleotide polymorphisms that marked an extended linkage disequilibrium block , including the liver pyruvate kinase gene ( P30613 ) , in several European-derived populations . In this study we sought to determine the molecular basis for the association and the phenotypic consequences of the risk haplotype . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Genes surrounding P30613 were resequenced in European-American and African-American cases and controls , and association with T2D was tested . Copy number variants ( CNVs ) were tested for four regions with real-time PCR . Expression of genes in the region was tested in adipose and muscle from nondiabetic subjects with each genotype . P01308 secretion , insulin sensitivity , and hepatic glucose production were tested in nondiabetic individuals with each haplotype combination . RESULTS : No coding variant in the region was associated with T2D . CNVs were rare and not associated with T2D . P30613 was not expressed in available tissues , but expression of genes Q9P1Z3 , P49760 , O14828 , and P14324 was not associated with haplotype combinations in adipose or muscle . Haplotype combinations were not associated with insulin secretion or peripheral insulin sensitivity , but homozygous carriers of the risk haplotype had increased hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemia . CONCLUSIONS : Noncoding variants in the P30613 region likely alter gene expression of one or more genes . Our extensive physiological and molecular studies suggest increased hepatic glucose production and reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity , thus pointing to P30613 itself as the most likely candidate gene in this population .
