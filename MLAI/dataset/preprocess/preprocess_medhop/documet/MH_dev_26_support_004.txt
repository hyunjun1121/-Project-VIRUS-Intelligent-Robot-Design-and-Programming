P09917 -activating protein inhibitors : development of 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( DB05225 ) . The potent and selective P09917 -activating protein leukotriene synthesis inhibitor 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl-1-[4-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-benzyl]-5-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)-1H-indol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propionic acid ( 11j ) is described . Lead optimization was designed to afford compounds with superior in vitro and in vivo inhibition of leukotriene synthesis in addition to having excellent pharmacokinetics and safety in rats and dogs . The key structural features of these new compounds are incorporation of heterocycles on the indole N-benzyl substituent and replacement of the quinoline group resulting in compounds with excellent in vitro and in vivo activities , superior pharmacokinetics , and improved physical properties . The methoxypyridine derivative 11j has an IC(50) of 4.2 nM in a P09917 -activating protein ( P20292 ) binding assay , an IC(50) of 349 nM in the human blood Q06643 (4) inhibition assay , and is efficacious in a murine ovalbumin model of allergen-induced asthma . Compound 11j was selected for clinical development and has successfully completed phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers .
