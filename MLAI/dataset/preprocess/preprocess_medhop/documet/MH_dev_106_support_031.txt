Polymorphisms of genes related to endothelial cells are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis patients of Cretan origin . BACKGROUND : Primary biliary cirrhosis ( P10515 ) is an organ specific autoimmune disease of still unidentified genetic etiology . We have shown that endothelins ( ETs ) , produced by the liver endothelial cells are increased in P10515 and may play a major pathogenetic role . AIMS : To study gene polymorphisms related to the endothelial cells ( P29474 , P10153 -1 genes ) and , to investigate whether the previously reported association of P16410 gene polymorphisms is replicated in a genetically homogeneous Greek population . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 P10515 patients ( 83 females , 93 % AMA+ , 74/100 Ludwig stage I-II ) and 158 healthy controls . P29474 , P16410 and ET1 polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLPs analysis . RESULTS : Both P29474 intron4 VNTR and P29474 exon7 G894T SNP were significantly associated with increased risk in P10515 . P10153 -11 rs2071942 " A " and rs5370 " T " alleles appeared a tendency for association with disease progression . No association was found between P10515 and the P16410 SNPs analyzed . CONCLUSIONS : We demonstrated that P29474 , a gene related to the liver endothelium function is associated with P10515 . Contrarily , the important in adaptive immunity gene P16410 was not associated with the disease in the homogeneous population analyzed . These results are compatible partially with our previous hypothesis that defects of the liver endothelial system , leading to endothelin overproduction , may be a fundamental early pathogenetic mechanism in P10515 .
