How I treat patients who mobilize hematopoietic stem cells poorly . Transplantation with 2-5 Ã— 10(6) mobilized P28906 (+)cells/kg body weight lowers transplantation costs and mortality . Mobilization is most commonly performed with recombinant human G- P04141 with or without chemotherapy , but a proportion of patients/donors fail to mobilize sufficient cells . BM disease , prior treatment , and age are factors influencing mobilization , but genetics also contributes . Mobilization may fail because of the changes affecting the P19526 /progenitor cell/BM niche integrity and chemotaxis . Poor mobilization affects patient outcome and increases resource use . Until recently increasing G- P04141 dose and adding P21583 have been used in poor mobilizers with limited success . However , plerixafor through its rapid direct blockage of the P61073 / P48061 chemotaxis pathway and synergy with G- P04141 and chemotherapy has become a new and important agent for mobilization . Its efficacy in upfront and failed mobilizers is well established . To maximize P19526 harvest in poor mobilizers the clinician needs to optimize current mobilization protocols and to integrate novel agents such as plerixafor . These include when to mobilize in relation to chemotherapy , how to schedule and perform apheresis , how to identify poor mobilizers , and what are the criteria for preemptive and immediate salvage use of plerixafor .
