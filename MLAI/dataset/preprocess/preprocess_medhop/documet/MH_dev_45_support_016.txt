Expression of angiogenesis- and apoptosis-related genes in chorionic villi derived from recurrent pregnancy loss patients . Angiogenesis takes place during embryogenesis , characterized by the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones . This biological process is also found in the female reproductive system , wound healing , and cancer development . Apoptosis , programmed cell death , is a physiological process in development , tissue homeostasis , and disease . Apoptosis is a normal event in several reproductive tissues including human placenta . In these studies , we investigated whether aberrant angiogenesis and apoptosis are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) . We compared the gene expression level for angiogenesis- and apoptosis-related genes in chorionic villi from RPL patients and those from normal controls . Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis revealed that 7 angiogenesis- and 12 apoptosis-related genes were abnormally expressed in chorionic villi from RPL patients . Angiogenesis-related genes that showed aberrant expression level are matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) , integrin , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , and leptin receptor . Expression levels for these genes , except for leptin receptor , showed less in chorionic villi from RPL patients than those from normal controls . In contrast , higher expression levels of 12 apoptosis-related genes ( caspase 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , Q92934 , Q07812 , P55957 , Fas , and P48023 ) were shown in chorionic villi from RPL patients than those from normal controls . Taken all together , it is likely that the lower expression of angiogenesis-related genes and the excessive expression of apoptosis-related genes are associated with RPL .
