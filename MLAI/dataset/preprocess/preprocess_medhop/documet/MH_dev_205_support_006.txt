Q99685 inhibition blocks chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors via activation of P42345 signaling . The endocannabinoid ( eCB ) system regulates mood , emotion , and stress coping , and dysregulation of the eCB system is critically involved in pathophysiology of depression . The eCB ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol ( 2-AG ) is inactivated by monoacylglycerol lipase ( Q99685 ) . Using chronic unpredictable mild stress ( CUS ) as a mouse model of depression , we examined how 2-AG signaling in the hippocampus was altered in depressive-like states and how this alteration contributed to depressive-like behavior . We report that CUS led to impairment of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition ( DSI ) in mouse hippocampal P00915 pyramidal neurons , and this deficiency in 2-AG-mediated retrograde synaptic depression was rescued by Q99685 inhibitor JZL184 . CUS induced depressive-like behaviors and decreased mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) activation in the hippocampus , and these biochemical and behavioral abnormalities were ameliorated by chronic JZL184 treatments . The effects of JZL184 were mediated by cannabinoid P21554 receptors . Genetic deletion of P42345 with adeno-associated viral ( AAV ) vector carrying the Cre recombinase in the hippocampus of mTORf/f mice recapitulated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUS and abrogated the antidepressant-like effects of chronic JZL184 treatments . Our results suggest that CUS decreases eCB- P42345 signaling in the hippocampus , leading to depressive-like behaviors , whereas Q99685 inhibitor JZL184 produces antidepressant-like effects through enhancement of eCB- P42345 signaling .
