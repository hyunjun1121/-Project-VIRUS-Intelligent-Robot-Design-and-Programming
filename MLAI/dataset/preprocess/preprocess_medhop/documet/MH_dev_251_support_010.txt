Effect of non-selective , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors on the PFA-100 closure time . The place of cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) in the peri-operative period remains under discussion . Due to the absence of P35354 in platelets , the risk of bleeding in patients who use selective NSAIDs is thought to be decreased . We studied the influence of aspirin , diclofenac , lornoxicam and rofecoxib on the in vitro bleeding time using the platelet function analyser ( PFA-100 ) . The PFA-100 simulates the process of platelet adhesion and aggregation after vascular injury in vitro . Measurements in 43 volunteers were performed at three time points : before , 3 h , and 12 h after oral ingestion of one of the randomly assigned study medications . DB00945 , diclofenac and lornoxicam had a significant effect on the in vitro closure time , while rofecoxib did not show this effect . This supports the use of P35354 selective drugs in the peri-operative period to minimise the risk of bleeding .
