Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma mimicking a giant cell tumor . Is this low grade dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma ? We report a very rare case of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma mimicking a benign giant cell tumor . A 22-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a history of mild left wrist pain after a skiing trauma . Radiology revealed an extensive meta-epiphyseal osteolytic lesion in the distal ulna , which appeared to be a giant cell tumor . Histological examination showed a biphasic tumor comprising chondroid and non-chondroid areas with a giant cell-rich lesion resembling a conventional giant cell tumor of the bone . Immunohistochemistry showed no expression of p16(INK4a) , P17948 , P35968 ( P35968 ) , P35916 , cKIT , Q00987 or P11802 . However , high expression of the tyrosine kinases P16234 and P09619 was observed . Molecular analysis showed no amplification of the cMYC gene and no activating mutations in the cKIT ( exons 9 and 11 ) or P16234 ( exon 18 ) genes . He has been on follow-up for ten months , with no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease . In summary , this report highlights a very rare case of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in which the dedifferentiated component of the tumor bears histologic resemblance to a conventional giant cell tumor of bone . We suggest that this tumor might be categorized in the group of low-grade dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas .
