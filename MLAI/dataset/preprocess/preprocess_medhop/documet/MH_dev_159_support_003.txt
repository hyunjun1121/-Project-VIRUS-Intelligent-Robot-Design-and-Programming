Gefitinib ( ' DB00317 ' , ZD1839 ) inhibits the growth response of bladder tumour cell lines to epidermal growth factor and induces P16035 . The effect of P01133 stimulation and its inhibition with gefitinib ( ' DB00317 ' , ZD1839 ) , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor , has been investigated in two P00533 -positive human bladder tumour cell lines , RT112 and RT4 . The growth of RT112 cells in a medium containing 10 % foetal bovine serum was inhibited by 50 % with 10 microM gefitinib , whereas this dose completely inhibited RT4 cell growth . Cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition in the serum-free medium . Increased growth of cells in the serum-free medium was observed with 10 or 50 ng x ml(-1) P01133 and the proliferative effect of P01133 stimulation in both cell lines was inhibited in the presence of 1 microM , but not 0.1 microM gefitinib . Zymography of the conditioned medium from RT112 cells treated with P01133 and gefitinib showed a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( P08253 ) concentrations . Western blot analysis showed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1( P01033 ) increased in the conditioned medium from RT112 cells treated with P01133 , and this was partially inhibited with both 1 and 5 microM gefitinib . Conversely , P16035 decreased with P01133 stimulation and this was reversed with gefitinib . Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 had no effect on the growth of either cell line . These studies show alterations in the balance of MMPs and their inhibitors in P01133 -stimulated bladder tumour cells , which are reversed by gefitinib , suggesting gefitinib should be investigated for its effect on human bladder tumours .
