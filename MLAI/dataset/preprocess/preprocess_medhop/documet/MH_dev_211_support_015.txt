P28562 regulates bone mass , osteoblast gene expression , and responsiveness to parathyroid hormone . Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) signaling via PTH 1 receptor ( Q03431 ) involves mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways . MAPK phosphatase 1 ( P28562 ) dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPKs in osteoblasts , the bone-forming cells . We previously showed that Q03431 activation in differentiated osteoblasts upregulates P28562 and downregulates pERK1/2-MAPK and cyclin D1 . In this study , we evaluated the skeletal phenotype of Mkp1 knockout ( KO ) mice and the effects of PTH in vivo and in vitro . Microcomputed tomography analysis of proximal tibiae and distal femora from 12-week-old Mkp1 KO female mice revealed osteopenic phenotype with significant reduction ( 8-46 % ) in bone parameters compared with wild-type ( WT ) controls . Histomorphometric analysis showed decreased trabecular bone area in KO females . Levels of serum osteocalcin ( OCN ) were lower and serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b ( TRAP5b ) was higher in KO animals . Treatment of neonatal mice with DB05829 ( 1-34 ) for 3 weeks showed attenuated anabolic responses in the distal femora of KO mice compared with WT mice . Primary osteoblasts derived from KO mice displayed delayed differentiation determined by alkaline phosphatase activity , and reduced expressions of Ocn and Runx2 genes associated with osteoblast maturation and function . Cells from KO females exhibited attenuated PTH response in mineralized nodule formation in vitro . Remarkably , this observation was correlated with decreased PTH response of matrix Gla protein expression . Expressions of pERK1/2 and cyclin D1 were inhibited dramatically by PTH in differentiated osteoblasts from WT mice but much less in osteoblasts from Mkp1 KO mice . In conclusion , P28562 is important for bone homeostasis , osteoblast differentiation and skeletal responsiveness to PTH .
