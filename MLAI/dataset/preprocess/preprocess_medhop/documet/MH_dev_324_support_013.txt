A new cell culture-based assay quantifies vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 function and reveals warfarin resistance phenotypes not shown by the dithiothreitol-driven Q9BQB6 assay . BACKGROUND : DB00682 directly inhibits the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 ( Q9BQB6 ) enzyme to effect anticoagulation . Q9BQB6 function has historically been assessed in vitro using a dithiothreitol ( DTT ) -driven vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase ( Q9BQB6 ) assay . DB00682 inhibits wild-type Q9BQB6 function by the DTT- Q9BQB6 assay . However , Q9BQB6 variants with warfarin resistance-associated missense mutations often show low Q9BQB6 activities and warfarin sensitivity instead of resistance . OBJECTIVES : A cell culture-based , indirect Q9BQB6 assay was developed and characterized that accurately reports warfarin sensitivity or resistance for wild-type and variant Q9BQB6 proteins . METHODS : Human coagulation factor (F)IX and Q9BQB6 variants were coexpressed in P29320 293T cells under standardized conditions at various warfarin concentrations . Secreted FIX activity served as surrogate marker to report wild-type and variant Q9BQB6 inhibition by warfarin . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : DB00682 dose-response curves fit to the secreted FIX activity data for coexpressed hVKORC1 wild-type , Val29Leu , Val45Ala and Leu128Arg variants . The corresponding calculated IC50 values were 24.7 , 136.4 , 152.0 and 1226.4 nm , respectively . Basal activities in the absence of warfarin for all Q9BQB6 variants were similar to that of wild-type Q9BQB6 . Ranked IC50 values from the cell culture-based assay accurately reflect elevated warfarin dosages for patients with Q9BQB6 missense mutation-associated warfarin resistance .
