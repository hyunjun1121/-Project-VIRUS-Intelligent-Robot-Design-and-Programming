Differential effects of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and methanandamide in P21554 knockout and wild-type mice . Mice devoid of P21554 cannabinoid receptors ( P21554 -/- mice ) provide a unique opportunity to further investigate the role of P21554 receptors in exocannabinoid and endocannabinoid effects . P21554 -/- mice ( N = 18 ) and their wild-type littermates ( P21554 +/+ mice ; N = 12 ) were placed in standard mouse operant chambers and trained to lever press under a fixed ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement . When stable lever press responding under the fixed ratio 10 schedule had been established , cannabinoids and noncannabinoids were administered to both groups . P21554 +/+ mice acquired the lever press response more readily than P21554 -/- mice . Delta(9)- DB00470 ( Delta(9)-THC ) decreased lever press responding in P21554 +/+ mice only , whereas methanandamide , a metabolically stable endocannabinoid analog , produced similar response rate decreases in both genotypic groups . Similar to Delta(9)-THC , another endocannabinoid analog , ( R ) - ( 20-cyano-16,16-dimethyl docosa-cis-5,8,11,14-tetraeno ) -1'-hydroxy-2'-propylamine ( O-1812 ) , decreased responding in P21554 +/+ mice , but not in P21554 -/- mice . The P21554 receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1- ( 2,4-dichlorophenyl-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride ( SR141716A ) blocked the effects of Delta(9)-THC , but not those of methanandamide . Because methanandamide binds poorly to CB2 receptors , these results suggest possible non- P21554 , non-CB2 mechanisms of action for methanandamide-induced behavioral disruption of lever press responding . DB00898 and morphine elicited greater response decreases in P21554 -/- mice than in P21554 +/+ mice , suggesting a possible role of P21554 receptors in the rate disruptive effects of these drugs . In contrast , diazepam did not produce between group differences , suggesting that P21554 receptors are not involved in diazepam-induced disruption of lever press responding .
