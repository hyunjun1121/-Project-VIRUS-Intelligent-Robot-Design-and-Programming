c- P05412 promotes P11274 - P00519 -induced lymphoid leukemia by inhibiting methylation of the 5' region of Cdk6 . The transcription factor c- P05412 and its upstream kinase P45983 have been implicated in P11274 - P00519 -induced leukemogenesis . P45983 has been shown to regulate P10415 expression , thereby altering leukemogenesis , but the impact of c- P05412 remained unclear . In this study , we show that P45983 and c- P05412 promote leukemogenesis via separate pathways , because lack of c- P05412 impairs proliferation of p185( P11274 - P00519 )-transformed cells without affecting their viability . The decreased proliferation of c-Jun(Δ/Δ) cells is associated with the loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 ( Q00534 ) expression . In c-Jun(Δ/Δ) cells , Q00534 expression becomes down-regulated upon P11274 - P00519 -induced transformation , which correlates with CpG island methylation within the 5' region of Cdk6 . We verified the impact of Cdk6 deficiency using Cdk6(-/-) mice that developed P11274 - P00519 -induced B-lymphoid leukemia with significantly increased latency and an attenuated disease phenotype . In addition , we show that reexpression of Q00534 in P11274 - P00519 -transformed c-Jun(Δ/Δ) cells reconstitutes proliferation and tumor formation in Nu/Nu mice . In summary , our study reveals a novel function for the activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcription factor c- P05412 in leukemogenesis by antagonizing promoter methylation . Moreover , we identify Q00534 as relevant and critical target of AP-1-regulated DNA methylation on P11274 - P00519 -induced transformation , thereby accelerating leukemogenesis .
