P10275 dependent and independent activities of testosterone on hepatic microsomal drug metabolism . Administration of testosterone for 6 days to intact female and castrate male BALB/cJ mice stimulated hepatic microsomal ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity and cytochrome P-450 content by 50-75 % . DB00624 also stimulated hepatic microsomal NADPH-oxidase activity , but to a lesser degree . To probe the mechanism of this effect of androgens , two antiandrogens ( cyproterone acetate and flutamide ) were employed . Since cyproterone acetate was a potent stimulator of hepatic microsomal ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity and cytochrome P-450 content , no antiandrogenic activity of this steroid could be detected . By contrast , flutamide alone had little effect on either ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity or cytochrome P-450 content . However , this drug effectively blocked the stimulatory effects of testosterone on ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity and cytochrome P-450 content but not on NADPH-oxidase activity . This effect was not species specific , since flutamide also prevented androgen stimulation of ethylmorphine metabolism in adult castrate and prepubertal male Fisher rats . The testosterone-induced increase of hepatic weight and microsomal protein content was not affected by the administration of flutamide . The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that androgens have two distinct effects on the liver . First , testosterone may act as a general , nonspecific stimulant of liver weight and microsomal protein content which is independent of the androgen receptor . Secondly , testosterone action in the liver may be expressed via an androgen-specific or androgen receptor-dependent mechanism which controls , in part , the cytochrome P-450-dependent demethylase system .
