P06401 modulator for emergency contraception : a randomized controlled trial . OBJECTIVE : Compare the efficacy and adverse effects of DB05366 , a new progesterone receptor modulator , to levonorgestrel for emergency contraception . METHODS : We performed a randomized , double-blinded noninferiority trial , enrolling healthy women seeking emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse . Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 50 mg of DB05366 , plus a placebo 12 hours later or two doses of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel taken 12 hours apart . Follow-up was scheduled 5 to 7 days after the expected onset of the next menstrual period . Posttreatment pregnancy was established by a positive urine test at follow-up and confirmed by quantitative serum beta-hCG . Daily diaries were used from the time of emergency contraception use until next menses to record adverse effects and sexual activity . RESULTS : Product efficacy was evaluable in 775 of DB05366 users and 774 of levonorgestrel users . Pregnancies occurred in 7 ( 0.9 % , 95 % confidence interval 0. P35326 .6 % ) and 13 ( 1.7 % , 95 % confidence interval 0.8-2.6 % ) women , respectively . Based on the estimated cycle day of unprotected intercourse , 85 % and 69 % of anticipated pregnancies , respectively , were averted . Nausea was reported by a somewhat greater percentage of DB05366 than levonorgestrel users ( 29 % compared with 24 % , P=.03 ) , but the distribution of other adverse effects was similar in both groups . Women in both groups experienced considerable variation in menstrual cycle length as compared with their reported individual normal cycle lengths . CONCLUSION : DB05366 is at least as effective as levonorgestrel in preventing pregnancies after unprotected intercourse and has a similar side effect profile . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : I .
