Signaling pathways mediating induction of the early response genes prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 and egr-1 by serotonin via 5- Q13049 receptors . Signaling pathways responsible for serotonin ( 5-HT ) -mediated induction of early response genes prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 ( P35354 , cyclooxygenase-2 ) and egr-1 were investigated in rat mesangial cells . Gene induction by 5-HT was dependent on 5- Q13049 receptors that were pertussis toxin insensitive indicating coupling to a G-protein of the Gq family . Binding of 5-HT to this receptor activates phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C ( P98160 ) and release of Ca2+ from internal stores , but this activation was not related to P35354 mRNA expression . Similarly , P19957 kinase was not involved in 5-HT signaling . Instead , inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific P98160 interfered with P35354 and egr-1 mRNA induction , suggesting this enzyme as a link between 5- Q13049 receptors and protein kinase C , an essential part of 5-HT-mediated signaling . The Q96HU1 kinase pathway was identified as common signaling pathway of 5-HT or phorbol ester-induced gene expression . Increase of intracellular DB02527 by forskolin or dibutyryl DB02527 did not induce P35354 or egr-1 mRNA expression by itself , but strongly inhibited 5-HT-mediated mRNA induction . P35354 mRNA and protein induction by 5-HT was also abolished by chelation of Ca2+ ions by EGTA , suggesting involvement of Ca2+-dependent enzymes . In contrast , egr-1 mRNA expression was superinduced in the presence of EGTA . Induction of Egr-1 protein was not changed by EGTA hinting to Ca2+-sensitive posttranscriptional steps . Activation of the Gq-coupled 5- Q13049 receptor thus leads to the expression of the early response genes P35354 and egr-1 , using common as well as differing signaling elements that allow differential regulation of the expression of these genes that are functionally related to renal hemodynamics and proliferation of mesangial cells , respectively .
