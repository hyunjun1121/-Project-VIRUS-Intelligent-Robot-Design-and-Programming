Decreased exercise-induced expression of nuclear factor-κB-regulated genes in muscle of patients with P48444 . BACKGROUND : Nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB activation and oxidative stress are physiologic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise but may be impaired in patients with P48444 . Therefore , we investigated NF-κB activity and expression of NF-κB-regulated genes in muscle of patients with P48444 and control subjects before and after exercise . METHODS : Quadriceps specimens were obtained before , immediately after , and 2 h after a submaximal cycle ergometry test from seven patients with P48444 ( 50.6 ± 5.7 SEM Q99581 (1) of patients with P48444 ) and seven age-matched control subjects . NF-κB DNA-binding activity in muscle and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively . mRNA expression and protein carbonylation were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot , respectively . RESULTS : In control subjects , P05231 , IκBα , tumor necrosis factor-α , IL-1β , superoxide dismutase , thioredoxin , heme oxygenase 1 , and heat shock protein-70 were upregulated in muscle after exercise , whereas in patients with P48444 only P05231 mRNA was increased . Exercise-induced antiapoptotic Bcl2 mRNA levels were attenuated in patients with P48444 compared with control subjects . Basal muscle protein oxidation was higher in patients with P48444 than in control subjects , but attenuated in response to exercise . No exercise-induced changes in NF-κB DNA-binding activity in muscle and PBMCs of either group were detected . CONCLUSIONS : Skeletal muscle of patients with P48444 is characterized by an impaired response to exercise of NF-κB-regulated genes encoding inflammatory cytokines , antioxidants , stress proteins , and survival factors .
