Secretagogue-stimulated pancreatic secretion is differentially regulated by constitutive NOS isoforms in mice . DB00435 ( NO ) and NO synthase ( NOS ) play controversial roles in pancreatic secretion . NOS inhibition reduces CCK-stimulated in vivo pancreatic secretion , but it is unclear which NOS isoform is responsible , because NOS inhibitors lack specificity and three NOS isoforms exist : neuronal ( P29475 ) , endothelial ( P29474 ) , and inducible ( P35228 ) . Mice having individual NOS gene deletions were used to clarify the NOS species and cellular interactions influencing pancreatic secretion . In vivo secretion was performed in anesthetized mice by collecting extraduodenal pancreatic duct juice and measuring protein output . Nonselective NOS blockade was induced with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine ( DB04223 ; 10 mg/kg ) . In vivo pancreatic secretion was maximal at 160 pmol.kg(-1).h(-1) CCK octapeptide ( CCK-8 ) and was reduced by NOS blockade ( 45 % ) and P29474 deletion ( 44 % ) . Secretion was unaffected by P35228 deletion but was increased by P29475 deletion ( 91 % ) . To determine whether the influence of NOS on secretion involved nonacinar events , in vitro CCK-8-stimulated secretion of amylase from isolated acini was studied and found to be unaltered by NOS blockade and P29474 deletion . Influence of NOS on in vivo secretion was further examined with carbachol . Protein secretion , which was maximal at 100 nmol.kg(-1).h(-1) carbachol , was reduced by NOS blockade and P29474 deletion but unaffected by P29475 deletion . NOS blockade by DB04223 had no effect on carbachol-stimulated amylase secretion in vitro . Thus constitutive NOS isoforms can exert opposite effects on in vivo pancreatic secretion . P29474 likely plays a dominant role , because P29474 deletion mimics NOS blockade by inhibiting CCK-8 and carbachol-stimulated secretion , whereas P29475 deletion augments CCK-8 but not carbachol-stimulated secretion .
