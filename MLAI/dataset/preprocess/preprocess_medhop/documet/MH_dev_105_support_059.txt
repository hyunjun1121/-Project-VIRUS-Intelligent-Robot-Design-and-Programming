Forced dimerization increases the activity of Δ P00533 /EGFRvIII and enhances its oncogenicity . Delta epidermal growth factor receptor ( Δ P00533 ) , an in-frame deletion mutant of the extracellular ligand-binding domain , which occurs in about 30 % of glioblastoma , is a potent oncogene that promotes tumor growth and progression . The signaling of Δ P00533 is ligand-independent and low intensity , allowing it to evade the normal mechanisms of internalization and degradation by the endocytic machinery and hence is persistent . The basis of the oncogenic potential of Δ P00533 remains incompletely understood , including whether dimerization plays an important role in its signal and whether its oncogenic potential is dependent on its relatively low intensity , when compared with the acutely activated wild-type receptor . To examine these two important questions , we have generated a chimeric Δ P00533 that allows forced dimerization via domains derived from variants of the P62942 protein that are brought together by FK506 derivatives . Forced dimerization of chimeric Δ P00533 significantly increased the intensity of its signal , as measured by receptor phosphorylation levels , suggesting that the naturally occurring Δ P00533 does not form strong or stable dimers as part of its low level signal . Interestingly , the increased activity of dimerized , chimeric Δ P00533 did not promote receptor internalization , implying that reduced rate of endocytic downregulation of Δ P00533 is an inherent characteristic . Significantly , forced dimerization enhanced the oncogenic signal of the receptor , implying that the Δ P00533 is a potent oncogene despite , not because of its low intensity .
