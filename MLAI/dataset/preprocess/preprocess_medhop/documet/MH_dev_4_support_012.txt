Neuronal influence behind the central nervous system regulation of the immune cells . Central nervous system ( CNS ) has a highly specialized microenvironment , and despite being initially considered an immune privileged site , this immune status is far from absolute because it varies with age and brain topography . The brain monitors immune responses by several means that act in parallel ; one pathway involves afferent nerves ( vagal nerve ) and the other resident cells ( neurons and glia ) . These cell populations exert a strong role in the regulation of the immune system , favoring an immune-modulatory environment in the CNS . Neurons control glial cell and infiltrated T-cells by contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms . Contact-dependent mechanisms are provided by several membrane immune modulating molecules such as Sema-7A , P48023 , P20273 , P41217 , Q08722 , P13591 , Q9UMF0 , and cadherins ; which can inhibit the expression of microglial inflammatory cytokines , induce apoptosis or inactivate infiltrated T-cells . On the other hand , soluble neuronal factors like Sema-3A , cytokines , neurotrophins , neuropeptides , and neurotransmitters attenuate microglial and/or T-cell activation . In this review , we focused on all known mechanism driven only by neurons in order to control the local immune cells .
