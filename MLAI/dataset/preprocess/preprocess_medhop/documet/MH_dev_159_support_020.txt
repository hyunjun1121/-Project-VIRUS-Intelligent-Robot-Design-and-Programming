Phospho-ΔNp63α is a key regulator of the cisplatin-induced microRNAome in cancer cells . Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cells exposed to cisplatin ( Q9NSE2 ) displayed a dramatic Q13315 -dependent phosphorylation of ΔNp63α that leads to the transcriptional regulation of downstream mRNAs . Here , we report that phospho (p)-ΔNp63α transcriptionally deregulates miRNA expression after Q9NSE2 treatment . Several p-ΔNp63α-dependent microRNA species ( miRNAs ) were deregulated in HNSCC cells upon Q9NSE2 exposure , including miR-181a , miR-519a , and miR-374a ( downregulated ) and miR-630 ( upregulated ) . Deregulation of miRNA expression led to subsequent modulation of mRNA expression of several targets ( P04637 -S46 , Q9H2X6 , Q13315 , P38936 and 1B , P42574 , P09874 and 2 , P24522 and 4 , P10415 and Q92843 , O15350 , P07947 , and P46937 ) that are involved in the apoptotic process . Our data support the notion that miRNAs are critical downstream targets of p-ΔNp63α and mediate key pathways implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs .
