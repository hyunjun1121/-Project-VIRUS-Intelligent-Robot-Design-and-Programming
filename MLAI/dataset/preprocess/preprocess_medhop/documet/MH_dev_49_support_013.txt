P01133 -like ligands mediate progesterone 's anti-apoptotic action on macaque granulosa cells . A local autocrine/paracrine role for progesterone is an absolute requirement for corpus luteum formation in primates . Despite this , the mechanism(s) remain obscure , although existing data suggest an anti-apoptotic action to be central . There are a limited number of progestin-regulated gene targets identified in the luteinizing primate follicle , suggesting that a small number of important genes may mediate progesterone action . Possible gene targets could be the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) family members amphiregulin ( P15514 ) and epiregulin ( O14944 ) . Using macaques undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation cycles , we show that the phosphorylation of P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) , P29323 1/2 , and AKT increases 6 h after an ovulatory human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) stimulus and remains activate through 24 h . Immunoreactive O14944 and P15514 ligands in the follicular fluid both increased in a time frame commensurate with P00533 phosphorylation . The mRNA expression of P15514 and O14944 in nonluteinized granulosa cells ( NLGC ) was induced in culture with hCG , an effect blocked by progesterone receptor ( P06401 ) antagonists . Overexpression of P06401 B in NLGC and treatment with a nonmetabolizable progestin did not increase either gene , indicating both progesterone and luteinizing hormone/CG are necessary . Addition of P01133 and P01133 -like ligands did not promote steroidogenesis in vitro by granulosa cells in the presence of gonadotropin , but were able to partially reverse DB00834 -induced cell death . These data suggest that progesterone promotes the expression of P15514 and O14944 , which in turn maintain viability of luteinizing granulosa cells , representing one possible mechanism whereby progesterone promotes corpus luteum formation in the primate .
