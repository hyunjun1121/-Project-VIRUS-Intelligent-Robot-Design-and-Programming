The role of serotonin receptor subtypes in the behavioural effects of neuroleptic drugs . A paw test study in rats . The present study was designed to evaluate the roles of serotonin P08908 and 5-HT2 receptors in the effects of neuroleptic drugs in the paw test . This behavioural test has been shown to model both the antipsychotic efficacy as well as the extrapyramidal side-effect liability of neuroleptic drugs . Whereas the P08908 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OHDPAT ) reduced the effects of the classical neuroleptic haloperidol , it increased the effects of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine . The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin as well as the P28335 /5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin , on the other hand reduced the effects of haloperidol , whereas the P28335 /5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ( DOI ) reduced the effects of clozapine . The most important finding , however , was that the behavioural effects of different ( putative ) neuroleptics ( fluphenazine , P35240 -39166 , remoxipride , prothipendyl , thioridazine and risperidone ) were differentially influenced by both 8-OHDPAT and DOI , suggesting that there are important differences between the neuronal mechanisms underlying the behavioural effects of these neuroleptic drugs , even within the subclasses of classical and atypical neuroleptics .
