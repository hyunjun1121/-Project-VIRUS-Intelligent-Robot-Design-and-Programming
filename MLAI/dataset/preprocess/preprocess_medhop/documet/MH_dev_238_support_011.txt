Molecular systematics of armadillos ( Xenarthra , Dasypodidae ) : contribution of maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes . The 30 living species of armadillos , anteaters , and sloths ( Mammalia : Xenarthra ) represent one of the three major clades of placentals . Armadillos ( Cingulata : Dasypodidae ) are the earliest and most speciose xenarthran lineage with 21 described species . The question of their tricky phylogeny was here studied by adding two mitochondrial genes ( P03886 [ P03886 ] and 12S ribosomal RNA [ 12S rRNA ] ) to the three protein-coding nuclear genes ( alpha2B adrenergic receptor [ P18089 ] , breast cancer susceptibility exon 11 [ P38398 ] , and P04275 exon 28 [ P04275 ] ) yielding a total of 6869 aligned nucleotide sites for thirteen xenarthran species . The two mitochondrial genes were characterized by marked excesses of transitions over transversions-with a strong bias toward CT transitions for the 12S rRNA-and exhibited two- to fivefold faster evolutionary rates than the fastest nuclear gene ( P18089 ) . Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Dasypodinae , Tolypeutinae , and Euphractinae , with the latter two armadillo subfamilies strongly clustering together . Conflicting branching points between individual genes involved relationships within the subfamilies Tolypeutinae and Euphractinae . Owing to a greater number of informative sites , the overall concatenation favored the mitochondrial topology with the classical grouping of Cabassous and Priodontes within Tolypeutinae , and a close relationship between Euphractus and Chaetophractus within Euphractinae . However , low statistical support values associated with almost equal distributions of apomorphies among alternatives suggested that two parallel events of rapid speciation occurred within these two armadillo subfamilies .
