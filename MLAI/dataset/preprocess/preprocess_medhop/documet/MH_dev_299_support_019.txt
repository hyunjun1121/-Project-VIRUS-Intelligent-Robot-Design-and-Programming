Monoclonal antibodies in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . With modern intensive combination polychemotherapy , the complete response ( CR ) rate in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) is 80 % to 90 % , and the cure rate is 40 % to 50 % . Hence , there is a need to develop effective salvage therapies and combine novel agents with standard effective chemotherapy . ALL leukemic cells express several surface antigens amenable to target therapies , including P11836 , P20273 , and P15391 . Monoclonal antibodies target these leukemic surface antigens selectively and minimize off-target toxicity . When added to frontline chemotherapy , rituximab , an antibody directed against P11836 , increases cure rates of adults with Burkitt leukemia from 40 % to 80 % and those with pre-B ALL from 35 % to 50 % . Inotuzumab ozogamicin , a P20273 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin , has resulted in marrow CR rates of 55 % and a median survival of 6 to 7 months when given to patients with refractory-relapsed ALL . DB09052 , a biallelic T cell engaging the CD3- P15391 monoclonal antibody , also resulted in overall response rates of 40 % to 50 % and a median survival of 6.5 months in a similar refractory-relapsed population . Other promising monoclonal antibodies targeting P11836 ( ofatumumab and obinutuzumab ) or P15391 or P11836 and bound to different cytotoxins or immunotoxins are under development . Combined modalities of chemotherapy and the novel monoclonal antibodies are under investigation .
