Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and its receptors P17948 and P35968 in primary and recurrent WHO grade III meningiomas . AIMS : WHO grade III meningiomas are malignant neoplasms for which new and more targeted treatment strategies are urgently needed . Although clinical trials investigating anti-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) targeted therapies are currently recruiting , knowledge about the expression of P15692 and P15692 receptors remains to be determined . METHODS : We investigated the expression of P15692 and its receptors P17948 and P35968 in 32 WHO grade III meningioma samples by immunohistochemistry . Furthermore , we performed in-situ hybridisation for P15692 . RESULTS : We found low P15692 expression in tumor and endothelial cells . Highest P15692 expression levels were seen in peri-necrotic tumor cells potentially suffering from hypoxia . P17948 and 2 were virtually absent on tumor cells , although endothelial cells displayed significantly higher levels reaching stronger expression for P35968 than P17948 . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings showing constant expression levels of P35968 in endothelial cells serve as a first indication that the use of small tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as DB01268 directly targeting the P15692 -receptors might be worth testing , also in the clinical context in cases of therapy-refractory meningiomas . Further investigations are needed to study the response to drugs targeting the P15692 pathway in relation to the expression profile of P15692 and its receptors in high grade meningiomas .
