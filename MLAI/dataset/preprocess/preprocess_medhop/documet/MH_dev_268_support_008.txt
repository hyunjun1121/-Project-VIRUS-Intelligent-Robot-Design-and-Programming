Oxyntomodulin differentially affects glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor beta-arrestin recruitment and signaling through Galpha(s) . The glucagon-like peptide ( GLP ) -1 receptor is a promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity , and there is great interest in characterizing the pharmacology of the P43220 and its ligands . In the present report , we have applied bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays to measure agonist-induced recruitment of betaarrestins and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase ( GRK ) 2 to the P43220 in addition to traditional measurements of second messenger generation . The peptide hormone oxyntomodulin is described in the literature as a full agonist on the glucagon and P0C6A0 receptors . Surprisingly , despite being full agonists in P43220 -mediated DB02527 accumulation , oxyntomodulin and glucagon were observed to be partial agonists in recruiting betaarrestins and P25098 to the P43220 . We suggest that oxyntomodulin and glucagon are biased ligands on the P43220 .
