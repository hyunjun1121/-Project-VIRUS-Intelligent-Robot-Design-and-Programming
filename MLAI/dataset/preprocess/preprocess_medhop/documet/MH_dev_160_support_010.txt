DB00203 attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress in pelvic ganglia neurons after bilateral cavernosal nerve damage . Erectile dysfunction is a common complication for patients undergoing surgeries for prostate , bladder , and colorectal cancers , due to damage of the nerves associated with the major pelvic ganglia ( P29372 ) . Functional re-innervation of target organs depends on the capacity of the neurons to survive and switch towards a regenerative phenotype . O76074 inhibitors ( PDE5i ) have been successfully used in promoting the recovery of erectile function after cavernosal nerve damage ( BCNR ) by up-regulating the expression of neurotrophic factors in P29372 . However , little is known about the effects of PDE5i on markers of neuronal damage and oxidative stress after BCNR . This study aimed to investigate the changes in gene and protein expression profiles of inflammatory , anti-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress related-pathways in P29372 neurons after BCNR and subsequent treatment with sildenafil . Our results showed that BCNR in Fisher-344 rats promoted up-regulation of cytokines ( interleukin- 1 ( IL-1 ) β , P05231 , P22301 , transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) , and oxidative stress factors ( DB02701 adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase , P05164 ( P05164 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , P01375 receptor superfamily member 5 ( P25942 ) that were normalized by sildenafil treatment given in the drinking water . In summary , PDE5i can attenuate the production of damaging factors and can up-regulate the expression of beneficial factors in the P29372 that may ameliorate neuropathic pain , promote neuroprotection , and favor nerve regeneration .
