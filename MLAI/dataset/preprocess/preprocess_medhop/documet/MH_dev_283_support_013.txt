Support for association between ADHD and two candidate genes : NET1 and P21728 . Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a common , multifactorial disorder with significant genetic contribution . Multiple candidate genes have been studied in ADHD , including the norepinephrine transporter ( NET1 ) and dopamine D1 receptor ( P21728 ) . NET1 is implicated in ADHD because of the efficacy of atomoxetine , a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor , in the treatment of ADHD . P21728 is primarily implicated through mouse models of ADHD . DNA from 163 ADHD probands , 192 parents , and 129 healthy controls was used to investigate possible associations between ADHD and polymorphisms in 12 previously studied candidate genes ( P28222 , 5- Q13049 , P28335 , P08913 , P43681 , P21964 , Q01959 , P21728 , P21917 , P21918 , NET1 , and P60880 ) . Analyses included case-control and family-based methods , and dimensional measures of behavior , cognition , and anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) . Of the 12 genes examined , two showed a significant association with ADHD . Transmission disequilibrium test ( P04053 ) analysis revealed significant association of two NET1 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with ADHD ( P < or = 0.009 ) ; case-control analysis revealed significant association of two P21728 SNPs with ADHD ( P < or = 0.008 ) . No behavioral , cognitive , or brain Q9BWK5 volume measurement significantly differed across NET1 or P21728 genotypes at an alpha of 0.01 . This study provides support for an association between ADHD and polymorphisms in both NET1 and P21728 ; polymorphisms in ten other candidate genes were not associated with ADHD . Because family-based and case-control methods gave divergent results , both should be used in genetic studies of ADHD .
