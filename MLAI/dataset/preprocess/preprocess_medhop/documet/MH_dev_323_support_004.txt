Systemic safety of anti- P15692 drugs : a commentary . INTRODUCTION : P15692 is a mediator of angiogenesis . Thus , concerns have been expressed following the use of P15692 inhibitors for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) . DB01270 , and more recently aflibercept , are P15692 inhibitors licensed for the treatment of nAMD . DB00112 is also used but unlicensed for this application . AREAS COVERED : A non-systematic review of nAMD trials was undertaken to investigate four outcomes : all-cause mortality , all systemic serious adverse events ( SSAEs ) , arteriothrombotic events ( ATEs ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) complications . Differences in event rates with injections of ranibizumab compared to bevacizumab , aflibercept , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) and sham were explored and quantified using fixed-effect meta-analyses . EXPERT OPINION : Anti- P15692 agents can influence vascular health ; however , the data suggest no difference in the risk of an ATE or death between anti- P15692 agents . Clinical trials are limited in their size and eligibility criteria and databases of patients treated in routine practice should also be scrutinized .
