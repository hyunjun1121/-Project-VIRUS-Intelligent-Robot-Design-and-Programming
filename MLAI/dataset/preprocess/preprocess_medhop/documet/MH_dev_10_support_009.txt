In vivo analysis of folate coenzymes and their compartmentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In eukaryotes , enzymes responsible for the interconversion of one-carbon units exist in parallel in both mitochondria and the cytoplasm . Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were constructed that possess combinations of gene disruptions at the SHM1 [ mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( SHMTm ) ] , SHM2 [ cytoplasmic SHMT ( SHMTc ) ] , MIS1 [ mitochondrial C1- DB00116 synthase ( C1-THFSm ) ] , ADE3 [ cytoplasmic P11586 ( C1-THFSc ) ] , GCV1 [ glycine cleavage system ( GCV ) protein T ] , and the GLY1 ( involved in glycine synthesis ) loci . Analysis of the in vivo growth characteristics and phenotypes was used to determine the contribution to cytoplasmic nucleic acid and amino acid anabolism by the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the interconversion of folate coenzymes . The data indicate that mitochondria transport formate to the cytoplasmic compartment and mitochondrial synthesis of formate appears to rely primarily on SHMTm rather than the glycine cleavage system . The glycine cleavage system and SHMTm cooperate to specifically synthesize serine . With the inactivation of SHM1 , however , the glycine cleavage system can make an observable contribution to the level of mitochondrial formate . Inactivation of SHM1 , SHM2 and ADE3 is required to render yeast auxotrophic for P54849 and methionine , suggesting that P54849 synthesized in mitochondria may be available to the cytoplasmic compartment .
