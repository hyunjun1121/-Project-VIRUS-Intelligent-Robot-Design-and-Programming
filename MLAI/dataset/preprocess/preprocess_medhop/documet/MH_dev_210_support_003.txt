Structure and function of eritadenine and its 3-deaza analogues : potent inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and hypocholesterolemic agents . d- DB03769 ( DEA ) is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase ( P23526 ) and has hypocholesterolemic activity . We have hypothesized that 3-deaza-DEA ( P01024 -DEA ) and its analogues retain high level of P23526 inhibitory activity and have resistance to deamination and glycosidic bond hydrolysis in vivo . Such P01024 -DEA analogues would have much higher hypocholesterolemic activity . P01024 -DEA , and its methyl ester ( P01024 -OMeDEA ) and its methyl amido ( P01024 -NMeDEA ) were synthesized to examine their P23526 inhibitory and hypocholesterolemic activities . A crystal structure of P23526 containing P01024 -DEA was determined and confirmed that DEA and P01024 -DEA bound to the same site of P23526 with the same binding mode . The P23526 inhibitory activities of P01024 -DEA ( K(I)=1.5 microM ) and P01024 -OMeDEA ( K(I)=1.5 microM ) are significantly lower than that of DEA ( K(I)=30 nM ) , while rats fed by P01024 -DEA and P01024 -OMeDEA decrease the total plasma cholesterol and phospholipids by 36-40 % and 23 % , respectively , which is similar to the level of reductions ( 42 % and 27 % ) by DEA . P01024 -NMeDEA lost most of the P23526 inhibitory activity ( K(I)=30 microM ) and dietary P01024 -NMeDEA does not decrease cholesterol and phospholipid in plasma but decreases the triacylglycerol level by 16 % . DEA and P01024 -DEA analogues are neither substrates nor inhibitors of adenosine deaminase .
