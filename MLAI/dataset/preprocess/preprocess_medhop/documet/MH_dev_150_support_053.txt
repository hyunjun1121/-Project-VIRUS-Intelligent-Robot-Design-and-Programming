DB00624 inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-1 production in human endometrial stromal cells in vitro . P10275 ( AR ) is reported to be expressed in human uterine endometrium , but not much information is available on the role of androgens in human endometrium . The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of androgens in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 , which is one of the important MMPs for menstruation and embryo implantation in human endometrium . Human endometrial stromal cells ( HESCs ) were obtained from human endometrium by enzymatic dissociation method . Purified HESCs were incubated with 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , testosterone , or E2 + testosterone . Progestins ( natural progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate ) or vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide ) were also added to the media instead of testosterone . Furthermore , hydroxyflutamide (FLU),a specific AR antagonist , was also supplemented to cultured media . The amounts of P03956 in cultured media and in HESC lysates were examined by ELISA measurements and western blotting analysis respectively . The expression of ARmRNA in HESCs RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR . DB00624 significantly inhibited P03956 in both cultured media and cell lysates in a dose-dependent manner . Progestins also inhibited P03956 . Furthermore , FLU completely recovered the decrease of P03956 induced by testosterone . ARmRNA was detected in all HESCs RNA . The present study demonstrated that the secretion and production of P03956 in HESCs in vitro were inhibited by testosterone through androgen receptors in a manner similar to that seen for progesterone . These findings indicate that androgen may play an important role in morphological and functional changes of human endometrium .
