DB00640 A(2A) receptor gene ( P29274 ) variants may increase autistic symptoms and anxiety in autism spectrum disorder . Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are heterogeneous disorders presenting with increased rates of anxiety . The adenosine A(2A) receptor gene ( P29274 ) is associated with panic disorder and is located on chromosome 22q11.23 . Its gene product , the adenosine A(2A) receptor , is strongly expressed in the caudate nucleus , which also is involved in P51689 . As autistic symptoms are increased in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome , and large 22q11.2 deletions and duplications have been observed in P51689 individuals , in this study , 98 individuals with P51689 and 234 control individuals were genotyped for eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in P29274 . Nominal association with the disorder was observed for rs2236624-CC , and phenotypic variability in P51689 symptoms was influenced by rs3761422 , rs5751876 and rs35320474 . In addition , association of P29274 variants with anxiety was replicated for individuals with P51689 . Findings point toward a possible mediating role of P29274 variants on phenotypic expression in P51689 that need to be replicated in a larger sample .
