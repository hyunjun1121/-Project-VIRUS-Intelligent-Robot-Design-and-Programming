Biochemical markers and genetic research of ADHD . ADHD ( attention hyperactivity disorder ) is a polygenetic disorder with various candidate genes . At this time , more than thirty dopaminergic , noradrenergic , serotonergic and GABA-ergic genes are known . The research of only some candidate genes ( P21917 , Q01959 , P21918 , P09172 , P31645 , P28222 and P60880 ) brought relatively consistent results confirming the heredity of ADHD syndromes . The results of research of other genes ( P14416 , P35462 , MAO , ADR2A , GABA A3 , GABA B3 ) are not clear yet . This paper summarizes the most important genetic data in correlations with biochemical periphery parameters ( especially for P09172 , HVA , MHPG , serotonin ) . Hypothetically , certain subgroups of ADHD may be identified by correlation of biochemical characteristics and some candidate genes . The paper discusses some implications for future research.
