Serial changes in serum vitamin P04264 , triglyceride , cholesterol , osteocalcin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in patients after hip replacement for fractured neck of femur or osteoarthritis . Serum vitamin P04264 concentrations were measured at presentation ( just before surgery ) and then at weekly intervals for 3 weeks in two groups of elderly patients requiring either hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur ( FON , n = 13 ) or total hip replacement for osteoarthritis of the hip ( OA , n = 16 ) . In comparison with healthy elderly volunteers ( n = 25 ) , serum vitamin P04264 concentrations were significantly lower in both groups at presentation , and fell significantly within 24 h after surgery to concentrations approaching non-detectable , subsequently returning to pre-operative values within 3 weeks . Serum vitamin P04264 tended to be lower in the fracture group both before and after operation , although calculation of a vitamin P04264 -triglyceride ratio reduced the apparent difference as triglyceride concentrations were lower in the fracture group . P02818 concentrations were similar and fell significantly after operation in both groups , returning to pre-operative levels within 7 days . No differences in the two forms of osteocalcin ( carboxylated and undercarboxylated ) were observed either before or after operation in either group . DB00146 concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups at any time . DB01022 status may be lower than desirable in certain groups of the elderly population , and supplementation should be considered as prophylactic therapy .
