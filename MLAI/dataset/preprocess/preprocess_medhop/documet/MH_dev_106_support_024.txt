Effects of P04626 amplicon size and genomic alterations of chromosomes 1 , 3 , and 10 on patient response to trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer . DB00072 is widely used for advanced breast cancer patients with P04626 -amplified tumors . Nevertheless , over half of these patients do not have an objective response . One reason may be altered expression of genes that might compensate for P04626 inhibition . We previously mapped the gene-rich region of chromosome 17 telomeric to P04626 , and reported considerable variability in the telomeric extent of the P04626 amplicon . Here we examined whether the variable amplicon size may be associated with patient response to trastuzumab . In addition , we looked at associations between response and several signaling pathway-related genes unrelated to the P04626 amplicon , including Q9Y243 , P60484 , P42336 , and P35354 . In 35 patients with P04626 -amplified metastatic breast cancer , with 40 % overall response to trastuzumab , fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the telomeric extent of the P04626 amplicon and the status of the several pathway-related genes . Objective response strongly correlated with the telomeric amplicon size , with 62 % of patients with shorter amplicons responding , compared with only 7 % of patients with longer amplicons ( P = 0.0015 ) . Abnormal copy number of P35354 was marginally associated with objective response ( P = 0.066 ) , while abnormal copy numbers of two reference loci , 1q25 and the chromosome 10 centromere , were significantly associated with response . Pairwise combinations of copy number status of these loci and P04626 amplicon size provided stronger associations and identified a group of patients without responders . These results suggest that patient selection for trastuzumab may be improved by considering P04626 amplicon size and genomic status of the 1q25 , P35354 , and centromere 10 loci .
