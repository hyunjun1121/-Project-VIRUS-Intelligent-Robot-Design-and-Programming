Golimumab in patients affected by moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis : an open-label study in thirty-two patients previously treated with other biologics . BACKGROUND : Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of DB06674 ( GLB ) in improving the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) . OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GLB in monotherapy in patients affected by PsA with cutaneous involvement unresponsive to other anti-tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) agents . METHODS : This study included 32 patients treated with GLB as monotherapy , at a dosage of 50 mg , subcutaneously , every 4 weeks . Patients were divided into 3 groups ( A , B , and C ) according to their number of previous anti- P01375 -α treatments ( 1 , 2 , or 3 ) . Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at weeks 0 , 12 , and 24 . RESULTS : All patients showed significant improvement of their clinical , inflammatory , and quality of life indexes . CONCLUSION : Data suggest that GLB can be successful and safe in patients affected by PsA with skin involvement previously treated with other anti- P01375 -α agents .
