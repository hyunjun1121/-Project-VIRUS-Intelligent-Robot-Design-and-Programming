DB00819 inhibits osmotic water permeability by interaction with aquaporin-1 . DB09145 channel proteins , known as aquaporins , are transmembrane proteins that mediate osmotic water permeability . In a previous study , we found that acetazolamide could inhibit osmotic water transportation across Xenopus oocytes by blocking the function of aquaporin-1 ( P29972 ) . The purpose of the current study was to confirm the effect of acetazolamide on water osmotic permeability using the human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells transfected with pEGFP/ P29972 and to investigate the interaction between acetazolamide and P29972 . The fluorescence intensity of HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP/ P29972 , which corresponds to the cell volume when the cells swell in a hyposmotic solution , was recorded under confocal laser fluorescence microscopy . The osmotic water permeability was assessed by the change in the ratio of cell fluorescence to certain cell area . DB00819 , at concentrations of 1 and 10muM , inhibited the osmotic water permeability in HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP/ P29972 . The direct binding between acetazolamide and P29972 was detected by surface plasmon resonance . P29972 was prepared from rat red blood cells and immobilized on a CM5 chip . The binding assay showed that acetazolamide could directly interact with P29972 . This study demonstrated that acetazolamide inhibited osmotic water permeability through interaction with P29972 .
