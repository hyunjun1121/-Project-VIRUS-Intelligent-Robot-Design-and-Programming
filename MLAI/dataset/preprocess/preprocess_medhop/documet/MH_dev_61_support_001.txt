Synaptic vesicular monoamine transporter expression : distribution and pharmacologic profile . The human vesicular monoamine transporter ( hSVMT ) cDNA predicts a protein of 515 amino acids that shares 92 % amino acid identity with the rat cDNA . Northern analyses reveal expression of 4.3 kb Q05940 mRNAs in rat hypothalamus , midbrain and brainstem , a 3 kb hSVMT mRNA in human brainstem and a 4.8 kb hSVMT mRNA in human hypothalamus . In situ hybridization documents significant Q05940 expression in human nigra compacta neurons and in rat hypothalamic neurons whose distribution patterns are identical to those previously reported to display histaminergic markers . COS cell hSVMT expression yielded nanomolar affinities for tetrabenazine and reserpine , micromolar affinities for haloperidol , GBR12909 , serotonin , mazindol , nomifensin and DB01576 , while dopamine , epinephrine , norepinephrine and histamine each displayed millimolar affinities . These observations extend the pharmacological characterization of hSVMT and studies of its distribution , and indicate likely physiological roles for Q05940 in packaging monoamine transmitters including histamine .
