[ Molecular relapse of chronic myeloid leukemia after discontinuation of imatinib mesylate for maintaining complete molecular response for more than 2 years ] . Although imatinib mesylate therapy is effective for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) patients , there are still some unanswered questions . It is unclear whether imatinib can actually cure CML and whether this therapy can be safely discontinued in patients showing complete cytogenetic and molecular responses . This report describes the clinical outcome of a patient with chronic phase CML who discontinued imatinib therapy after achieving molecular remission . This patient has shown a relapse based on transcription-mediated amplification-hybridization protection assay ( TMA- Q9Y251 ) to monitor P11274 - P00519 transcripts , highlighting the uncertainty of discontinuing imatinib therapy for five months .
