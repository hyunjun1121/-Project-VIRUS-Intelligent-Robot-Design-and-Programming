P10275 (CAG)n polymorphism and androgen levels in women with systemic lupus erythematosus and healthy controls . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is an autoimmune disorder that affects mainly females . Therefore , interrelations between the reproductive and immune system have been assumed . Considering the complex influence of hormones and receptors , we aimed to investigate the influence of androgens and androgen receptor ( AR ) polymorphism in women with SLE . One hundred and sixteen patients and 44 healthy women were investigated . DB00624 , sex hormone-binding globulin ( P04278 ) , dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate ( DHEAS ) concentrations and AR (CAG)n polymorphism were determined . SLE patients had significantly lower levels of total and free testosterone and DHEAS in comparison with the controls . No differences in the CAG repeat length between the groups were established . Women with two alleles carrying more than 22 CAG repeats had significantly higher levels of P04278 ( 101.51 ± 61.81 vs. 69.22 ± 45.93 nmol/l , p = 0.015 ) and DHEAS ( 3.11 ± 2.65 vs. 2.11 ± 3.06 μmol/l , p = 0.007 ) and a tendency to higher testosterone concentrations ( 2.35 ± 2.10 vs. 1.71 ± 1.70 nmol/l , p = 0.056 ) in comparison with other women . The CAG repeat length in the relatively longer (CAG)n allele was inversely related to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ P10323 index ( r = -0.258 , p = 0.009 ) . In conclusion , the androgen receptor (CAG)n polymorphism is not related to the development of SLE , but it could modulate the severity of the lupus chronic damages as well as the androgen levels in women .
