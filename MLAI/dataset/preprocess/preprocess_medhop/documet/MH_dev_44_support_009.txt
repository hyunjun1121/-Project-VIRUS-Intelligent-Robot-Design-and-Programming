Comparison of lipopeptide-based immunocontraceptive vaccines containing different lipid groups . We have previously shown that incorporating the lipid moiety dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine ( Pam2Cys ) into peptide structures effectively adjuvants otherwise weak immunogens . In this study lipopeptides based on luteinising hormone releasing hormone ( P01148 ) as a B cell epitope , [ B ] , were synthesised in tandem with a 17-residue T-helper epitope , [ T ] , derived from the fusion protein of the morbillivirus canine distemper virus . In this way vaccine candidates with the structure [ T ] -[B] were produced . These peptides were then lipidated with different diacylated moieties . The acyl moieties used were : palmitic acid ( C16 ) to give Pam2Cys , stearic acid ( C18 ) to give Ste2Cys , lauric acid ( C12 ) to give Lau2Cys and DB04519 ( Q99618 ) to give Oct2Cys . We compared the immunogenicities of these simple lipopeptides in BALB/c mice by measuring their ability to induce anti- P01148 antibodies and found that immunogenicity was dependent on the length of the alkane chains of the incorporated lipid moieties with the hierarchy C16=C18 > C12 > Q99618 . The antibody levels elicited by the lipopeptides also correlated with their ability to inhibit the reproductive capability of female mice in fertility trials . Furthermore , the C16 lipopeptide was the most effective in activating dendritic cells , measured by up regulation of surface MHC Class II molecules , and also in activating NF-kappaB in a Toll-like receptor-2 ( O60603 ) -dependent manner .
