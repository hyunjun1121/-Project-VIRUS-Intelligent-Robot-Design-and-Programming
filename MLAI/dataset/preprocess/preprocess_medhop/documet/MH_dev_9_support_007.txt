DB05692 , a thrombin receptor ( P25116 ) antagonist for the prevention and treatment of atherothrombosis . DB05692 is a novel antiplatelet agent undergoing development by Schering-Plough Corp for the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis . The compound is an orally administered himbacine analog that potently antagonizes the platelet thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) , which leaves the procoagulant function of thrombin intact . In preclinical studies , DB05692 demonstrated no effect on bleed time or coagulation parameters . In both cynomolgus monkeys and humans , the compound had high bioavailability and inhibited ex vivo TRAP ( thrombin receptor-activating peptide ) -stimulated platelet aggregation in a potent and long-lasting manner . In a phase II clinical trial of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention , DB05692 added to standard therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel did not increase major or minor thrombolysis in myocardial infarction bleeding , and demonstrated a trend toward decreased major adverse cardiovascular events versus placebo . At the time of publication , three phase III trials were underway to assess the efficacy and safety of DB05692 for at least 1 year in up to 35,000 patients with acute coronary syndromes or atherosclerosis . The distinct mechanism of action of DB05692 allows for cardiovascular protection without the liability of increased bleeding associated with other antiplatelet therapies . Phase III trials in high-risk patients will determine the use of DB05692 in cardiological practice .
