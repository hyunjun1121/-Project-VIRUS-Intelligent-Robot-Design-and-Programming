Epigenetic regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( Q9BYF1 ) by Q96EB6 under conditions of cell energy stress . Q9BYF1 ( angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ) counterbalances the actions of P12821 ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ) by metabolizing its catalytic product , the vasoactive and fibrogenic peptide AngII ( angiotensin II ) , into Ang-(1-7) [ angiotensin-(1-7) ] . Enhanced Q9BYF1 expression may be protective in diabetes , cardiovascular disease and cancer . However , relatively little is known about the specific physiological factors regulating Q9BYF1 expression . In the present paper , we show , by Western blotting and qPCR ( quantitative real-time PCR ) , that Q9BYF1 expression is increased under conditions of cell stress , including hypoxic conditions , IL (interleukin)-1β treatment and treatment with the AMP mimic AICAR ( 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside ) . The NAD+-dependent deacetylase Q96EB6 ( silent information regulator T1 ) was found to be up-regulated after AICAR treatment but , conversely , was down-regulated after IL-1β treatment . ChIP analysis demonstrated that Q96EB6 bound to the Q9BYF1 promoter and that binding was increased after AICAR treatment , but decreased after IL-1β treatment . Inhibition of Q96EB6 activity ablated the AICAR-induced increase in Q9BYF1 . In conclusion , we have established that the expression of the Q9BYF1 transcript is controlled by the activity of Q96EB6 under conditions of energy stress .
