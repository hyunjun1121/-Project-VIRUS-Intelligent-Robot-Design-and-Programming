[ Postoperative pulmonary embolism ] . Post-operative thrombo-embolic disease remains a frequent occurrence in spite of advances in their prophylaxis . Evaluation of 60 case-reports of this disease which often includes peripheral manifestations and always pulmonary manifestations , enables to specify the role of the procedure itself ( mostly orthopaedic surgery 60 % ) , pelvic surgery 20 % , the chronology of events ( possibility of early embolism between D1 and D3 and usual occurrence of manifestations between P41226 and D18 , and the importance of the background , whether investigated or not : deficiencies in anti-thrombin III , protein C and S : 4 cases . The diagnosis is based on clinical signs ( non-specific ) and the laboratory tests , especially scintigraphy ( screening ) and angiography , absolutely necessary for the diagnosis and evaluation of the amputation coefficient ( Miller index ) . With a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism , it is always necessary to look for a proximal venous thrombosis . The treatment , calls for heparin ( quite seldom ) , thrombolytics ( DB00013 , P00747 in our experience ) , the indication of which must take into consideration the delays and the nature of the previous procedure , and finally surgery ( massive forms where thrombolytics are contraindicated ) . The thrombo-embolic manifestations with thrombogenic thrombopenia secondary to heparin are quite frequent , in a surgical environment ( 10 cases ) and difficult to treat .
