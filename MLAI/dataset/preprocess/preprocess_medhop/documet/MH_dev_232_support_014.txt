Effects on thrombin generation of single injections of DB02351 in patients with calf vein thrombosis . STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine whether single injections of DB02351 , a direct thrombin inhibitor , can inhibit thrombin generation in patients with calf vein thrombosis and , if so , if the inhibition is sustained . DESIGN : Phase II open label cohort study . SETTING : Tertiary-care referral centres , university affiliated hospitals . PATIENTS : 10 patients with venographically-demonstrated calf vein thrombosis . INTERVENTION : Patients received a single injection of DB02351 , either 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously or 0.6 mg/kg as a 15 min intravenous infusion . P00734 fragment ( F1++2 ) levels , as an index of thrombin generation , were measured before as well as 6 h post- and 24 h post- DB02351 administration . Patients were followed with non-invasive tests to detect thrombus extension into the proximal veins . RESULTS : There was a significant reduction in the levels of F1+2 with both regimens , 6 h after DB02351 . The F1+2 levels 24 h post- DB02351 showed a significant increase relative to the 6 h post- DB02351 results . One patient developed thrombus extension into the popliteal vein and was treated with conventional anticoagulants . CONCLUSION : The single injections of DB02351 used in the study produced incomplete and temporary suppression of F1+2 . Complete and permanent inhibition of thrombin generation with DB02351 in patients with calf vein thrombosis may require higher doses , multiple subcutaneous injections and/or prolonged intravenous infusion .
