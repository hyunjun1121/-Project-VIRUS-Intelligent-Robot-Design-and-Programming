Activation of the P18621 pathway contributes to immune escape in P00533 -driven lung tumors . The success in lung cancer therapy with programmed death ( PD ) -1 blockade suggests that immune escape mechanisms contribute to lung tumor pathogenesis . We identified a correlation between P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) pathway activation and a signature of immunosuppression manifested by upregulation of P18621 , Q9NZQ7 , CTL antigen-4 ( P16410 ) , and multiple tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines . We observed decreased CTLs and increased markers of T-cell exhaustion in mouse models of P00533 -driven lung cancer . P18621 antibody blockade improved the survival of mice with P00533 -driven adenocarcinomas by enhancing effector T-cell function and lowering the levels of tumor-promoting cytokines . Expression of mutant P00533 in bronchial epithelial cells induced Q9NZQ7 , and Q9NZQ7 expression was reduced by P00533 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with activated P00533 . These data suggest that oncogenic P00533 signaling remodels the tumor microenvironment to trigger immune escape and mechanistically link treatment response to P18621 inhibition . SIGNIFICANCE : We show that autochthonous P00533 -driven lung tumors inhibit antitumor immunity by activating the P18621 / Q9NZQ7 pathway to suppress T-cell function and increase levels of proinflammatory cytokines . These findings indicate that P00533 functions as an oncogene through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms and raise the possibility that other oncogenes may drive immune escape .
