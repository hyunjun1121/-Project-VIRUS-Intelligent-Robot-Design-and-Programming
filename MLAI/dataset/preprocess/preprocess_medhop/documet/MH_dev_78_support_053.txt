Short-term/low-dose aspirin-induced duodenal erosions are not dependent on Helicobacter pylori infection , cyclooxygenase expression and prostaglandin E2 levels . OBJECTIVE : The mechanisms of interaction between Helicobacter pylori infection and low-dose aspirin in the induction of duodenal erosions are not fully understood . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-dose aspirin on the induction of duodenal erosions , the expression of cyclooxygenases and prostaglandin ( PG ) -E(2) levels in healthy subjects according to their H. pylori status . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty healthy volunteers ( H. pylori-negative n=10 , H. pylori-positive n=10 ) received 100 mg aspirin/day for 1 week . During esophagogastroduodenoscopy , duodenal biopsies were taken before and at days 1 , 3 , and 7 of medication . P23219 and -2 expressions were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , and immunohistochemistry ; mucosal PGE(2) levels were determined by ELISA . Three months after successful eradication of infection , nine H. pylori-positive subjects repeated the protocol . RESULTS : DB00945 -induced duodenal erosions occurred independently of whether H. pylori infection was present or not . There was no difference in duodenal P23219 and P35354 expression among the groups and expression was not affected by aspirin . Basal duodenal PGE(2) levels were similar among the different groups ( H. pylori-negative 4.3+/-4.2 , H. pylori-positive 5.2+/-1.3 , following H. pylori eradication 5.2+/-1.4 ng/microg protein ) and were not affected by low-dose aspirin . CONCLUSIONS : In healthy subjects , low-dose aspirin-induced duodenal erosions are not influenced by H. pylori status . Low-dose aspirin medication for one week does not affect either cyclooxygenase expression or duodenal PGE(2) levels and therefore is likely to induce duodenal damage mainly through topical toxicity .
