Differential regulation of type I interferon and epidermal growth factor pathways by a human Respirovirus virulence factor . A number of paramyxoviruses are responsible for acute respiratory infections in children , elderly and immuno-compromised individuals , resulting in airway inflammation and exacerbation of chronic diseases like asthma . To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections , we searched for cellular targets of the virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type 3 ( hPIV3-C ) . We found that hPIV3-C interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with P42224 and P62993 , whereas C proteins from measles or Nipah viruses failed to do so . Binding to P42224 explains the previously reported capacity of hPIV3-C to block type I interferon signaling , but the interaction with P62993 was unexpected . This adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor ( P01133 ) receptor to MAPK/ P29323 pathway , a signaling cascade recently found to be involved in airway inflammatory response . We report that either hPIV3 infection or transient expression of hPIV3-C both increase cellular response to P01133 , as assessed by Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of P27361 /2 , 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and translation initiation factor 4E ( P06730 ) . Furthermore , inhibition of MAPK/ P29323 pathway with U0126 prevented viral protein expression in infected cells . Altogether , our data provide molecular basis to explain the role of hPIV3-C as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis and demonstrate that Paramyxoviridae have evolved a single virulence factor to block type I interferon signaling and to boost simultaneous cellular response to growth factors .
