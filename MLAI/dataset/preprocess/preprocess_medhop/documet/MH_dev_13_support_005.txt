The increase of memory T cell subsets in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome . Two-color and three-color flow cytometry was carried out to determine whether the memory T cells ( CD45RO+ T cells ) play a major role in lymphocyte dysfunction of 26 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( P01308 ) . The P01308 patients were divided into three groups : ( 1 ) 10 patients who were not receiving glucocorticoid hormone ( P30793 ) and were suffering from acute nephrotic state were referred to as N1 ; ( 2 ) 8 patients who were in remission maintained by P30793 therapy alone were referred to as N2 ; ( 3 ) 8 patients who were free of P30793 therapy for at least 4 months were referred to as N3 . Group N1 demonstrated a significant increase in the percentage of CD45RO+ P01730 + T cells and CD45RO+CD8+ T cells ( p < 0.05 ) compared with 11 controls , and these subsets were noted to have a tendency to decrease to control levels in groups N2 and N3 . Furthermore , interleukin-2 receptor-alpha expressed subsets in CD45RO+ P01730 + T cells ( CD45RO+ P01730 +CD25+ T cells ) were also increased only in group N1 ( p < 0.02 ) . A similar tendency of absolute counts was observed in these subsets . These results suggest that activated memory T cells reflect lymphocyte dysfunction at initial onset or relapse in P01308 children .
