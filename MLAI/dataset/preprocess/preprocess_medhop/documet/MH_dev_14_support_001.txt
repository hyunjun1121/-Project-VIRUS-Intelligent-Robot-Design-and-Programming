Gossypin up-regulates P01130 through activation of P29323 pathway : a signaling mechanism for the hypocholesterolemic effect . Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease . This study aims to elucidate the effect of gossypin on cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells . Results indicated that gossypin significantly reduced the total cholesterol concentration in a dose-dependent manner . There was a time- and dose-dependent increase in the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) protein . However , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis , was not affected by gossypin . Moreover , gossypin had no effect on nuclear sterol regulatory element binding proteins ( SREBP ) -2 abundance . The activity of gossypin on P01130 expression was inhibited by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) inhibitor PD98059 . Western blotting analysis revealed that gossypin treatment dose- and time-dependently increased P29323 activation and preceded the up-regulation of P01130 expression . Collectively , these new findings identify gossypin as a new hypocholesterolemic agent that up-regulates P01130 expression independent of Q12772 but is dependent on P29323 activation .
