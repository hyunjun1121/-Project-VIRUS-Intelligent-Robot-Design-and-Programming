Differential interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) and IL-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria . Human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells ( P25054 ) , including dendritic cells ( DC ) and monocytes , that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like HIV-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease . We investigated the response of DC and monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria , including Escherichia coli , Enterococcus sp. , and Bacteroides fragilis . All three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers P25942 and Q01151 on myeloid dendritic cells ( mDC ) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) . However , only mDC produced cytokines , including interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) , IL-12p40/70 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -Î± ) , in response to bacterial stimulation . Cytokine profiles in whole PBMC differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species : B. fragilis induced production of IL-23 , IL-12p70 , and P22301 , whereas E. coli and Enterococcus induced an P22301 -predominant response . mDC and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced P22301 and IL-23 in response to E. coli and B. fragilis . Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of IL-23 similar to those of B. fragilis , suggesting that B. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among Bacteroides species . The addition of recombinant human P22301 to PBMC cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the IL-23 response , whereas blocking P22301 significantly enhanced IL-23 production , suggesting that P22301 controls the levels of IL-23 produced . These results indicate that blood mDC and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that P22301 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes .
