Akt-dependent heme oxygenase-1 induction by NS-398 in P13671 glial cells : a potential role for CO in prevention of oxidative damage from hypoxia . We investigated whether increased heme oxygenase ( HO ) -1 activity by NS-398 is responsible for protection against hypoxia-induced damage in P13671 cells . The expression of P09601 was analyzed by Western blot and cell viability was analyzed by lactate dehydroxygease ( LDH ) activity . NS-398 increased P09601 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner during both normoxia and hypoxia ( 95 % N(2)/5 % CO(2) ) , but the latter was much more sensitive . Because induction of P09601 occurred due to hypoxia itself , NS-398 seemed to potentiate the expression of P09601 . The reduced cell viability due to hypoxia was significantly reversed by either NS-398 or [Ru(CO)(3)(Cl)(2)](2) , a CO-donor . Zinc protophorphrin ( ZnPPIX ) , a P09601 inhibitor , inhibited the protective effect of NS-398 against hypoxia . Treatment with glucose oxidase ( Q9UJM8 , 20 mU/ml ) increased ROS production and caused apoptotic death , as assayed by DCFH-DA and TUNEL , respectively . NS-398 significantly reduced Q9UJM8 -induced cell death and ROS production ; these effects were reversed by pre-treatment with oxyhemoglobin ( HbO(2) ) , a CO/NO scavenger , or ZnPPIX . Finally , NS-398 increased P37231 luciferase activity in transiently P37231 transfected P13671 cells , which was antagonized by ZnPPIX . NS-398 increased phosphorylation of Akt , and LY-294002 , a specific PI(3) kinase inhibitor , inhibited NS-398-induced P09601 expression . Taken together , we conclude that therapeutic use of NS-398 in the treatment of oxidative stress-oriented neuronal disorders would be beneficial through dual actions : P09601 induction and P35354 inhibition .
