Correlation of somatic mutations and clinical outcome in melanoma patients treated with Carboplatin , Paclitaxel , and sorafenib . PURPOSE : DB00398 is an inhibitor of P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) , and RAF kinases , amongst others . We assessed the association of somatic mutations with clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma treated on E2603 , comparing treatment with carboplatin , paclitaxel Â± sorafenib ( CP vs. CPS ) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Pretreatment tumor samples from 179 unique individuals enrolled on E2603 were analyzed . Genotyping was performed using a custom iPlex panel interrogating 74 mutations in 13 genes . Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test , logistic regression , and Cox proportional hazards models . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods . RESULTS : P15056 and P01111 mutations were found at frequencies consistent with other metastatic melanoma cohorts . P15056 -mutant melanoma was associated with worse performance status , increased number of disease sites , and younger age at diagnosis . P01111 -mutant melanoma was associated with better performance status , fewer sites of disease , and female gender . P15056 and P01111 mutations were not significantly predictive of response or survival when treated with CPS versus CP . However , patients with P01111 -mutant melanoma trended toward a worse response and PFS on CP than those with P15056 -mutant or WT/WT melanoma , an association that was reversed for this group on the CPS arm . CONCLUSIONS : This study of somatic mutations in melanoma is the last prospectively collected phase III clinical trial population before the era of P15056 -targeted therapy . A trend toward improved clinical response in patients with P01111 -mutant melanoma treated with CPS was observed , possibly due to the effect of sorafenib on CRAF .
