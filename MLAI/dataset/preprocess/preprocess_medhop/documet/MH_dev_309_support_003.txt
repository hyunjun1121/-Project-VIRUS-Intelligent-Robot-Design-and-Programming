DB00399 -induced IPP/ApppI production in vivo . Bisphosphonates are currently the most important class of anti-resorptive drugs used for the treatment of diseases involving excess bone resorption . Recently we discovered a new mechanism of action for bisphosphonates . Previously it has been shown that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates ( N-BPs ) are not metabolized . However , our studies revealed that N-BPs induce formation of a novel pro-apoptotic DB00171 analog ( ApppI ) , as a consequence of the inhibition of P14324 in the mevalonate pathway , and the subsequent accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate ( IPP ) in vitro . The primary aim of the current study was to determine whether zoledronic acid ( a N-BP ) induces IPP/ApppI formation in vivo . Mass spectrometry was used to identify whether in vivo administration of zoledronic acid-induced IPP/ApppI production by mouse peritoneal macrophages or bone marrow cells . IPP/ApppI could be detected in extracts from peritoneal macrophages isolated from zoledronic acid-treated animals . Increasing IPP/ApppI accumulation was determined up to 7 days after drug injection , indicating prolonged P14324 inhibition by zoledronic acid . Importantly , this is the first report of in vivo production of ApppI , supporting the biological significance of this molecule .
