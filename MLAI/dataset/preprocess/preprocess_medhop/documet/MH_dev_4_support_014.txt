Immunohistochemical analysis in ethinylestradiol-treated breast cancers after prior long-term estrogen-deprivation therapy . BACKGROUND : P03372 ( ER ) positive breast cancer can often be treated by hormone therapy ; however a certain population of ER-positive patients become resistant to hormone therapy after long-term hormone treatment . DB00977 ( EE2 ) is a derivative of estrogen , which has shown promising effects in these patients . METHODS : We successfully obtained tissue samples from 6 patients undergoing EE2 treatment and examined 13 well-known breast cancer-related factors by immunohistochemistry . Of the 6 patients , 5 responded but one patient did not . RESULTS : Before EE2 treatment , staining for both ER and androgen receptor ( AR ) was strong in the nucleus , and the progesterone receptor ( PgR ) was almost no staining . EE2 treatment significantly down-regulated ER and up-regulated PgR while nuclear and cytosolic AR were oppositely down- and up-regulated , respectively . Cytosolic staining of P38398 was significantly up-regulated by EE2 whereas nuclear staining tended to decrease . Individual comparisons suggested less induction of PgR and decreasing AKT but increasing pAKT in the non-responder following EE2 treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Our observations revealed that EE2 activated ER downstream genes ; however it did not stimulate cell growth . This suggests that hormone resistant cells might receive growth signals from a non-genomic pathway and this may be reflected in their sensitivity to EE2 treatment .
