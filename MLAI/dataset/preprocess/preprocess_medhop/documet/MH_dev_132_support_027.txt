P00797 -angiotensin system is involved in the mechanism of increased serum asymmetric dimethylarginine in essential hypertension . Endothelium-dependent/nitric oxide ( NO ) -mediated vasodilation is impaired in hypertensive individuals . DB01686 ( DB01686 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase , is synthesized by many types of cells including vascular endothelial cells . The serum level of DB01686 is elevated in patients with essential hypertension , but the mechanism for this increase is unknown . Therefore , the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) is involved . Patients with essential hypertension [ systolic blood pressure ( BP ) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg ] were randomized to an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitor treatment group ( perindopril , 4mg/day for 4 weeks , n = 7 ) , an angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor antagonist treatment group ( losartan , 50 mg/day for 4 weeks , n = 7 ) or a beta-blocker treatment group ( bisoprolol , 5 mg/day for 4 weeks , n = 7 ) . Before and after the treatment , BP , serum concentration of DB01686 and plasma concentration of P04275 ( P04275 , a biological marker of endothelial injury ) were measured . DB00790 , losartan and bisoprolol decreased BP to a similar extent , and either perindopril or losartan , but not bisoprolol , significantly decreased serum DB01686 and plasma P04275 . These findings suggest that the DB01367 may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum DB01686 as well as to the endothelial injury observed in hypertensive patients . The vasculoprotective actions of P12821 inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained at least in part by amelioration of the endothelial injury through a decrease in the serum DB01686 concentration .
