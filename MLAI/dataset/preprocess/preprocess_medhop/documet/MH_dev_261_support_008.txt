Nitrergic response to cyclophosphamide treatment in blood and bone marrow . Daily intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide ( P15085 ) ( 50 mgkg(-1) of body weight ) for 5 days resulted in reduced levels of marrow and blood cellularity , which was most pronounced in 18 days post-treatment ( pt ) . On day 18 after P15085 treatment the enhancedlevels of nitric oxide ( NO ) precursors and metabolites ( L-arginine , L-citrulline , reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) ) of marrow and blood cells ( platelet , neutrophil , lymphocyte and monocyte ) resulted from up-regulation of Ca(II)/calmodulin( P62158 )-independent " inducible " NO synthase ( P35228 ) , with a lessercontribution of Ca(II)/ P62158 -dependent " constitutive " P29474 isoforms to systemic NO.Biphasic response to P15085 of marrow nitrergic system , i.e. both P35228 and P29474 showed significantly depressed activities , as well as diminished levels of NO metabolites on day 9 pt , suggested that signals in addition to NO might be involved in P15085 -induced inhibition of hematopoesis , while a gradual increase of neutrophil and platelet NOS activity appeared to be contributed to a P15085 -induced development of granulopenia , thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage .
