Cystic fibrosis modifier genes related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is one of the most common life-shortening genetic disorders , and the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is the major causal gene . However , a substantial clinical variability among patients with identical P13569 genotypes suggests the presence of modifier genes . We tested the effect of four genes involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . Analysis of a primary cohort detected eight candidate polymorphisms that were genotyped in the secondary cohort of 1579 patients ; lung function and age at first infection with P. aeruginosa were considered as the phenotypes . Both additive and codominant models were considered , adjusting for confounding variables but not for multiple comparisons . In the secondary cohort , heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) rs2071749 had the most significant effect on lung function in the pediatric group ( P=0.01 ; P(corrected)=0.03 ) , and complement factor 3 ( P01024 ) rs11569393 and P09601 rs2071746 in the adult groups ( P=0.03 for both variants ; P(corrected)=0.16 , 0.09 ) . No polymorphism of complement factor B ( P00751 ) or toll-like receptor 4 ( O00206 ) had a significant modifying effect on lung function in either group . We have identified two genes that showed nominal association with disease severity among CF patients . However , because of the multiple comparisons made , further studies are required to confirm the interaction between these modifying genes and P13569 .
