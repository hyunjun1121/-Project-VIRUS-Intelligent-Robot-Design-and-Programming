Expression of prostacyclin receptors in luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone immortalized neurons : role in the control of hormone secretion . PGs of the E series are involved in the control of P01148 secretion . The present experiments were conducted to clarify whether DB01240 ( prostacyclin ) might be also involved in such a control , using multiple methodological approaches on immortalized P01148 -secreting neurons . A RT-PCR procedure to detect mouse P43119 ( IP ) messenger RNA was first applied , and the results obtained showed the presence of a specific transcript in two cell lines of immortalized P01148 neurons ( GT1-1 and GN11 cell lines ) . Receptor binding assays on membrane preparations from GT1-1 cells showed the presence of a single specific and saturable class of binding sites ( Kd = 4.6 nM ; 10,000 sites/cell ) for [3H]iloprost , a stable analog of DB01240 . Competition experiments showed that the binding sites labeled by [3H]iloprost possess the pharmacological characteristics of IP receptors . In functional studies , DB01240 and its analogs , iloprost and cicaprost , were able to stimulate P01148 release from the GT1-1 cells with elevated potencies ( EC50 = 0.6-4.3 nM ) ; PGE1 was only slightly less active ( EC50 = 28.5 nM ) , whereas DB00917 , considered the major PG involved in P01148 secretion , was poorly effective ( EC50 = 921 nM ) . The relative potencies ( EC50 ) of these compounds in stimulating the intracellular accumulation of DB02527 were in line with their P01148 -releasing activities . In conclusion , these results indicate that immortalized P01148 -secreting neurons express IP receptors through which DB01240 may exert relevant effects on P01148 release .
