Deficiency of a phosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule influences haemopoietic progenitor binding to marrow stroma in chronic myeloid leukaemia . The interactions between haemopoietic progenitor cells and marrow stromal cells that are essential for the regulation of normal haemopoiesis are defective in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . The presence of primitive progenitor cells ( blast colony-forming cells , Bl- Q15814 ) in the blood of patients with CML is reflected by their reduced capacity to bind to marrow derived stromal layers in vitro . Whereas normal bone marrow Bl- Q15814 bind irreversibly to cultured stromal layers ( and none are found in normal blood ) , the Bl- Q15814 in CML bind transiently and then detach . The normal cell adhesion mechanism is partially sensitive to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C ( Pl- P98160 ) , indicating the participation of a phosphatidylinositol ( Pl ) -linked structure ; however , when CML cells were treated with Pl- P98160 it had no effect on progenitor binding . Two other Pl-linked structures , decay-accelerating factor ( P08174 ) and lymphocyte function associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) were normally expressed on P28906 positive CML cells and normally susceptible to Pl- P98160 treatment . The treatment of normal cells with Pl- P98160 , to mimic the situation in CML , resulted in the indiscriminate and inefficient binding of Bl- Q15814 to stroma . Moreover , treatment of the normal cells with 5637 conditioned medium ( CM ) , which contains haemopoietic growth factors , also reduced the binding capacity of normal Bl- Q15814 ; 5637CM treatment did not alter the expression of P08174 . It is proposed that a Pl-linked cell adhesion molecule ( P62158 ) is deficient in CML as a consequence of the constitutive activation of P00519 kinase whilst , in normal cells , CAMs attached in this manner are responsible for efficient adhesion to stroma and are regulated by growth factors .
