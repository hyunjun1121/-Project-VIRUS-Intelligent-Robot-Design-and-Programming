Pharmacokinetic profiles of the novel P35354 selective inhibitor cimicoxib in dogs . DB05095 ( CX ) is a novel imidazole derivative that is a cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and the latest P35354 selective inhibitor to be released for veterinary use . Currently there is limited information available on the pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of CX . The aim of the current study was to evaluate the PK features of CX after administration of the recommended dose and after administration of a more variable dose rate in the form of the commercially available tablet . In addition , the effects of food intake on the PK properties were also evaluated . In the first study , five healthy Beagle dogs received 2mg/kg CX via the oral route following a period of fasting . The second study was conducted using six healthy Labrador retriever dogs which each received an 80 mg tablet ( approximate dose 1.95-2.5mg/kg ) using a crossover design , both in the fasted and fed condition . The plasma concentrations of CX were detected by a validated HPLC method . No adverse effects were observed in any dogs during the experiment . The results from the PK analysis were similar between the studies , regardless of precision of dose and fasted and fed conditions . The mean peak concentration of CX was 0.49 and 0.43 Î¼g/mL under fasted and fed conditions , respectively . The mean half-life was about 3h after all treatments . In addition , simulated multiple dosing data revealed that time over minimal effective concentration was similar after 1.95 , 2.0 and 2.5mg/kg dose administrations . These findings suggest that slight variation from the recommended dose should not alter the therapeutic outcome . In addition , CX can be administered to fed dogs without significantly affecting blood levels .
