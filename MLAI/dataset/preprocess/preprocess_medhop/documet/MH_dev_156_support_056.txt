DB01240 -deficient mice develop ischemic renal disorders , including nephrosclerosis and renal infarction . BACKGROUND : DB01240 ( DB01240 ) is a short-lived endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation and a potent vasodilator and regulator of the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells . To study the role of DB01240 in the vascular system in vivo , DB01240 -deficient ( PGID ) mice were established by genetic disruption of the DB01240 synthase gene . METHODS AND RESULTS : DB01240 synthase-null mice were generated by replacing the exons of DB01240 synthase gene that encodes for the catalytic site of the enzyme with a neomycin resistance gene . In these mice , DB01240 levels in the plasma , kidneys , and lungs were reduced , whereas thromboxane and prostaglandin E2 levels became elevated . Blood pressure and the amounts of urea nitrogen and creatinine in plasma of the PGID mice were significantly higher than those of wild-type mice ( P < 0.05 ) . They developed progressive morphological abnormalities in the kidneys , accompanied by atrophy , surface irregularity , fibrosis , cyst , arterial sclerosis , and hypertrophy of vessel walls . Thickening of the thoracic aortic media and adventitia were observed in aged PGID mice . Importantly , these phenotypes have not been reported in P43119 -deficient mice . CONCLUSIONS : DB01240 deficiency resulted in the development of vascular disorders with the thickening of vascular walls and interstitial fibrosis , especially in mouse kidneys . The findings demonstrated in vivo that DB01240 is important in the homeostasis of blood vessels . Our established PGID mice are useful for studies on the initiation and development of vascular diseases , such as ischemic renal disorders with arterial sclerosis and infarction , and also for studies on the novel signaling pathway of DB01240 .
