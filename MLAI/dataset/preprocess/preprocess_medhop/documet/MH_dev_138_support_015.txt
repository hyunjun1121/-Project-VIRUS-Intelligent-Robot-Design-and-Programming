Muscarinic cholinergic signaling in cervical cancer cells affects cell motility via P27361 /2 signaling . AIMS : The etiology of cervical cancer depends primarily on infection with human papillomaviruses , but tobacco smoking is the most important behavioral risk factor for this cancer . Therefore , we have previously confirmed involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) in cervical cancer biology . In order to comprehensively evaluate the role of cholinergic signaling in cervical cells , we have addressed additional participation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( mAChRs ) . MAIN METHODS : We have studied the expression of mAChRs and cholinergic system components by reverse transcription PCR and Western blots , the motility of cervical cancer cells in cell culture , and the signaling from mAChRs via the P27361 /2 signaling pathway . KEY FINDINGS : The cervical cancer cells HeLa , SiHa and CaSki express four of the five mAChRs , M1 , M3 , M4 , and M5 , and the acetylcholine ( ACh ) synthesizing and degrading enzymes choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) , and vesicular ACh transporter ( Q16572 ). mAChR-dependent signaling induces cervical cell motility , which requires P27361 /2 activation , and could be abrogated by mAChR antagonists . SIGNIFICANCE : The epidemiological finding that tobacco smoke raises the prevalence of cervical cancer has led to analysis of the cholinergic signaling in cervical biology and carcinogenesis . Cervical cancer cells express several nAChRs and mAChRs , whose activation leads to changes of cellular properties such as increased motility and proliferation that favor a carcinogenic phenotype . The signaling involves intracellular phosphorylation cascades including P27361 /2 .
