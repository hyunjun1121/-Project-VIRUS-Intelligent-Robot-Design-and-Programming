A new clinical evidence-based gene-environment interaction model of depression . In our current understanding of mood disorders , the role of genes is diverse including the mediation of the effects of provoking and protective factors . Different or partially overlapping gene sets play a major role in the development of personality traits including also affective temperaments , in the mediation of the effects of environmental factors , and in the interaction of these elements in the development of depression . Certain genes are associated with personality traits and temperaments including e.g. , neuroticism , impulsivity , openness , rumination and extroversion . Environmental factors consist of external ( early and provoking life events , seasonal changes , social support etc. ) and internal factors ( hormones , biological rhythm generators , comorbid disorders etc ) . Some of these environmental factors , such as early life events and some prenatal events directly influence the development of personality traits and temperaments . In the NEWMOOD cohort polymorphisms of the genes of the serotonin transporter , P08908 , P28222 and 5- Q13049 and endocannabinoid P21554 receptors , tryptophan hydroxylase , P16220 , P23560 and GIRK provide evidence for the involvement of these genes in the development of depression . Based on their role in this process they could be assigned to different gene sets . The role of certain genes , such as promoter polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter ( 5-HTTLPR ) and P21554 receptor has been shown in more than one of the above factors . Furthermore , gene-gene interactions of these promoters associated with anxiety suggest the application of these polymorphisms in personalized medicine . In this review we introduce a new model including environmental factors , genes , trait and temperament markers based on human genetic studies .
