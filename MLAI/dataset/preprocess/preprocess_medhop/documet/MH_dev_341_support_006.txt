Reversal of dopamine D2 agonist-induced inhibition of ventral tegmental area neurons by Gq-linked neurotransmitters is dependent on protein kinase C , G protein-coupled receptor kinase , and dynamin . Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area are important components of brain pathways related to addiction . Prolonged exposure of these neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) decreases their sensitivity to inhibition by DA , a process called DA-inhibition reversal ( P30518 ) . P30518 is mediated by phospholipase C and conventional subtype of protein kinase C ( cPKC ) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1-like DA receptors , or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of 5-HT(2) or neurotensin receptors . In the present study , we further characterized this phenomenon by use of extracellular recordings in brain slices to examine whether P30518 is linked to G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 ( P25098 ) or dynamin by assessing P30518 in the presence of antagonists of these enzymes . P30518 was blocked by β- O14965 inhibitor , which inhibits P25098 , and by dynasore , which blocks dynamin . Reversal of inhibition by D2 agonist quinpirole was produced by serotonin ( 50 µM ) and by neurotensin ( 5-10 nM ) . Serotonin-induced or neurotensin-induced reversal was blocked by β- O14965 inhibitor , dynasore , or cPKC antagonist 5,6,7,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile ( Gö6976 ) . This further characterization of P30518 indicates that cPKC , P25098 , and dynamin play important roles in the desensitization of D2 receptors . As drugs of abuse produce persistent increases in DA concentration in the ventral tegmental area , reduction of D2 receptor sensitivity as a result of drug abuse may be a critical factor in the processes of addiction .
