Dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia and disruption of prepulse inhibition : evidence for a role of D3 receptors ? The dopamine D3/D2 receptor agonists 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , and PD128907 , the mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine , the D2 agonist bromocriptine , and the D1/D5 agonist SKF38393 were examined in models of hypothermia and prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in Wistar rats . As dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia has been proposed as a model of D3 receptor function , and dopamine agonists are known to disrupt PPI , drug potencies to induce hypothermia were established and compared with doses necessary to disrupt PPI . 7-OH-DPAT , quinpirole , quinelorane , PD128907 , and apomorphine , reduced body temperature and disrupted PPI with a similar rank order of potency ( quinelorane > quinpirole = 7-OH-DPAT > PD128907 = apomorphine ) . DB01200 and SKF38393 were ineffective in both models . In a separate study , the dopamine reuptake inhibitors cocaine and GBR 12909 had no effect on PPI . In a final set of studies , the D2/D3 antagonist raclopride blocked both 7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and 7-OH-DPAT-induced PPI disruption . The P08908 antagonist WAY 100,135 , and the peripheral D2-like antagonist domperidone had no effect . These findings suggest that the hypothermia and PPI disruptions seen with some of these dopamine agonists may be mediated by central D3 receptors ; however , only studies using more selective dopamine receptor ligands can definitively rule out effects at the D2 or D4 receptors .
