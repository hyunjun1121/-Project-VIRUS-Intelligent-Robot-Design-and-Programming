Gram negative bacteria increase non-small cell lung cancer metastasis via O00206 activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation . Surgery is required for the curative treatment of lung cancer but is associated with high rates of postoperative pneumonias predominantly caused by gram negative bacteria . Recent evidence suggests that these severe infectious complications may decrease long term survival after hospital discharge via cancer recurrence , but the mechanism is unclear . Lung cancer cells have recently been demonstrated to express Toll-like receptors ( TLR ) that mediate pathogen recognition . We hypothesized that incubation of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli can augment cancer cell adhesion , migration and metastasis via O00206 signaling . Incubation of murine and human NSCLC cells with E. coli increased in vitro cell adhesion to collagen I , collagen IV and fibronectin , and enhanced in vitro migration . Using hepatic intravital microscopy , we demonstrated that NSCLC cells have increased in vivo adhesion to hepatic sinusoids after coincubation with gram negative bacteria . These enhanced cell adhesion and migration phenotypes following incubation with E. coli were attenuated at three levels : inhibition of O00206 ( DB04933 ) , p38 MAPK ( BIRB0796 ) and P27361 /2 phosphorylation ( PD184352 ) . Incubation of murine NSCLC cells in vitro with E. coli prior to intrasplenic injection significantly augmented formation of in vivo hepatic metastases 2 weeks later . This increase was abrogated by NSCLC O00206 blockade using DB04933 . O00206 represents a potential therapeutic target to help prevent severe postoperative infection driven cancer metastasis .
