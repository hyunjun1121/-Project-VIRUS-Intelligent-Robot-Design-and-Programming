Hypermorphic mutation of phospholipase C , γ2 acquired in ibrutinib-resistant CLL confers Q06187 independency upon B-cell receptor activation . DB09053 has significantly improved the outcome of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Recent reports attribute ibrutinib resistance to acquired mutations in Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) , the target of ibrutinib , as well as the immediate downstream effector phospholipase C , γ2 ( P16885 ) . Although the C481S mutation found in Q06187 has been shown to disable ibrutinib 's capacity to irreversibly bind this primary target , the detailed mechanisms of mutations in P16885 have yet to be established . Herein , we characterize the enhanced signaling competence , Q06187 independence , and surface immunoglobulin dependence of the P16885 mutation at R665W , which has been documented in ibrutinib-resistant CLL . Our data demonstrate that this missense alteration elicits Q06187 -independent activation after B-cell receptor engagement , implying the formation of a novel Q06187 -bypass pathway . Consistent with previous results , P16885 (R665W) confers hypermorphic induction of downstream signaling events . Our studies reveal that proximal kinases P43405 and P07948 are critical for the activation of mutant P16885 and that therapeutics targeting P43405 and P07948 can combat molecular resistance in cell line models and primary CLL cells from ibrutinib-resistant patients . Altogether , our results engender a molecular understanding of the identified aberration at P16885 and explore its functional dependency on Q06187 , P43405 , and P07948 , suggesting alternative strategies to combat acquired ibrutinib resistance .
