DB01032 reduces infection and inflammation in acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia . The activation of inflammasome signaling mediates pathology of acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia . This suggests that the inflammasome might represent a target to limit the pathological consequences of acute P. aeruginosa lung infection . Q96RD7 ( Px1 ) channels mediate the activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1β induced by Q99572 receptor activation . The approved drug probenecid is an inhibitor of Px1 and DB00171 release . In this study , we demonstrate that probenecid reduces infection and inflammation in acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia . Treatment of mice prior to infection with P. aeruginosa resulted in an enhanced clearance of P. aeruginosa and reduced levels of inflammatory mediators , such as IL-1β . In addition , probenecid inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators in murine alveolar macrophages and human U937 cell-derived macrophages upon bacterial infection but not in human bronchial epithelial cells . Thus , Px1 blockade via probenecid treatment may be a therapeutic option in P. aeruginosa pneumonia by improving bacterial clearance and reducing negative consequences of inflammation .
