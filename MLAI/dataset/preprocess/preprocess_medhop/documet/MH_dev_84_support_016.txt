A review and proposed nomenclature for major proteins of the milk-fat globule membrane . The characteristics and possible functions of the most abundant proteins associated with the bovine milk-fat globule membrane are reviewed . Under the auspices of the Milk Protein Nomenclature Committee of the ADSA , a revised nomenclature for the major membrane proteins is proposed and discussed in relation to earlier schemes . We recommend that proteins be assigned specific names as they are identified by molecular cloning and sequencing techniques . The practice of identifying proteins according to their Mr , electrophoretic mobility , or staining characteristics should be discontinued , except for uncharacterized proteins . The properties and amino acid sequences of the following proteins are discussed in detail : P15941 , xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase , P16671 , butyrophilin , adipophilin , periodic acid Schiff 6/7 ( DB00233 6/7 ) , and fatty acid binding protein . In addition , a compilation of less abundant proteins associated with the bovine milk-fat globule membrane is presented .
