Critical role of sorafenib exposure over time for its antitumor activity in thyroid cancer . DB00398 , a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the P15692 , PDGF and P15056 pathways , has demonstrated significant clinical activity in metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer . However , all patients eventually experience disease progression with a median progression-free survival close to 10 months . Since sorafenib exposure is known to decrease over time , we hypothesized that dose adjustments aiming to restore adequate exposure could lead to further clinical activity . We report , as a proof of concept on a patient with radio-iodine resistant metastatic thyroid cancer , who experienced disease progression after an initial response to sorafenib ( 400 mg twice daily ) . Whereas the thyroglobulin-progression-free survival at standard doses was 6 months , iterative dose optimization led to a prolonged progression-free survival up to 41 months . DB00398 doses were increased up to 1600 mg bid , in order to maintain clinical activity , and to restore active plasma concentration , since sorafenib exposure had decreased over the time . Toxicity was mild and manageable for more than 2 years . However , the patient eventually experienced grade 3 proteinuria leading to treatment discontinuation . This observation opens up new horizons for daily management of radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer patients progressing under standard doses of sorafenib , and stress the need to monitor its plasma concentration .
