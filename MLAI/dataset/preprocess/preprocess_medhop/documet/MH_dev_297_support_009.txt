DB00055 attenuates coagulation-associated over-expression of fibrinolytic activity by suppressing the thrombin-dependent inactivation of P05121 . Several activated coagulation factors have been reported to enhance fibrinolysis by neutralizing plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) activity . We evaluated the physiological relevance of this mechanism using the euglobulin clot lysis time ( ECLT ) assay in the presence and absence of Ca2+ , which is controlled by P05121 and mimics physiological thrombolysis . We found that the ECLT ( 18.5 +/- 0.6 h ) was shortened by Ca2+ ( 5 mm ) ( 6.6 +/- 0.1 h ) . A significant difference was observed in thrombin generation by the presence of Ca2+ in the euglobulin fraction . P00734 was almost fully converted to thrombin within 15 min in the presence of Ca2+ , whereas essentially no conversion was observed without Ca2+ . The presence of activated protein C ( aPC ) suppressed thrombin generation , and attenuated the shortening of ECLT in a dose-dependent manner , an effect enhanced by phospholipid and protein S . In the absence of Ca2+ , aPC did not prolong the ECLT . After addition of biotin-labeled recombinant P05121 to the euglobulin fraction , P05121 was cleaved to lower molecular weight forms only in the presence of Ca2+ . This cleavage did not occur in the presence of aPC , suggesting that thrombin was the catalyst for P05121 cleavage . The cleavage and inactivation of P05121 by generated thrombin is proposed to be responsible for the shortening of ECLT by Ca2+ and for coagulation-associated over-expression of fibrinolysis . Under such conditions , aPC appeared to suppress thrombin generation and to normalize highly activated fibrinolysis .
