Proliferation of chicken neuroretina cells induced by v-src , in vitro , depends on activation of the E2F transcription factor . Quiescent chicken or quail retina neuroblasts ( NR ) can be induced to proliferate actively , in culture , by the v-src oncoprotein . The chE2F-1 transcription factor , a physiological partner of the retinoblastoma gene product , is highly expressed in vivo , in dividing chicken neuroretina cells ( P21554 ) . It is sharply down-regulated as cells enter the post-mitotic differentiation stage , thus suggesting that E2F activity is a prerequisite for NR cell proliferation . In the present paper , transient expression assays of different forms of chE2F-1 were used to investigate the function of E2F for switching P21554 cells from a quiescent to a proliferative state in vitro . Attempts to substitute the effects of v-src by an ectopic expression of Q01094 were unsuccessful . However , in the same conditions , Q01094 supports full growth of CEF in serum-depleted medium . Deletion mutants of Q01094 , with potential dominant-negative properties , were transfected in RSV infected P21554 cells . One of these truncated mutants induces a P55008 phase block in RSV-transformed P21554 cells indicating that , although Q01094 overexpression can not overcome the cell proliferation block of post-mitotic P21554 cells Q01094 , activity is an important component of the growth signal pathway delivered by v-src in these nervous cells .
