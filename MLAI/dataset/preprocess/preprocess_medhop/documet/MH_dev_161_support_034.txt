Mycoepoxydiene , a fungal polyketide inhibits MCF-7 cells through simultaneously targeting p53 and NF-κB pathways . Mycoepoxydiene ( Q9UQD0 ) is a cytotoxic polyketide that is isolated from the marine fungal strain Diaporthe sp . HLY-1 , which is associated with mangroves ; however , the mechanism of action of Q9UQD0 remains unknown . Here , we report the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis activation and growth inhibition induced by Q9UQD0 in MCF-7 cells . The present results show that Q9UQD0 induces DNA damage through the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which resulted in the phosphorylation of P16104 and the activation of the Q13315 kinase ( Q13315 ) and p53 signaling pathways . In addition , Q9UQD0 increases the accumulation of IκBα and enhances the association between IKKγ and Hsp27 via the activation of Hsp27 , which eventually resulted in the inhibition of P01375 -α-induced NF-κB transactivation . Therefore , we conclude that Q9UQD0 inhibits MCF-7 cells by simultaneously activating p53 to induce apoptosis and suppressing NF-κB to disrupt cell proliferation . Because small molecules having both of these effects are rare , further exploration of Q9UQD0 as an antitumor lead compound is needed .
