Temporal profiling of lapatinib-suppressed phosphorylation signals in P00533 / P04626 pathways . DB01259 is a clinically potent kinase inhibitor for breast cancer patients because of its outstanding selectivity for epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and EGFR2 ( also known as P04626 ) . However , there is only limited information about the in vivo effects of lapatinib on P00533 / P04626 and downstream signaling targets . Here , we profiled the lapatinib-induced time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation dynamics in SKBR3 breast cancer cells by means of quantitative phosphoproteomics . Among 4953 identified phosphopeptides from 1548 proteins , a small proportion ( 5-7 % ) was regulated at least twofold by 1-10 Î¼m lapatinib . We obtained a comprehensive phosphorylation map of 21 sites on P00533 / P04626 , including nine novel sites on P04626 . Among them , serine/threonine phosphosites located in a small region of P04626 ( amino acid residues 1049-1083 ) were up-regulated by the drug , whereas all other sites were down-regulated . We show that DB02527 -dependent protein kinase is involved in phosphorylation of this particular region of P04626 and regulates P04626 tyrosine kinase activity . Computational analyses of quantitative phosphoproteome data indicated for the first time that protein-protein networks related to cytoskeletal organization and transcriptional/translational regulation , such as Q96LT9 complexes ( i.e. hnRNP , snRNP , telomerase , ribosome ) , are linked to P00533 / P04626 signaling networks . To our knowledge , this is the first report to profile the temporal response of phosphorylation dynamics to a kinase inhibitor . The results provide new insights into P00533 / P04626 regulation through region-specific phosphorylation , as well as a global view of the cellular signaling networks associated with the anti-breast cancer action of lapatinib .
