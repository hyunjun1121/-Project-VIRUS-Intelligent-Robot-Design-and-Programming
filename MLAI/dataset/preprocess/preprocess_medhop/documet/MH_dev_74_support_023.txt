A novel tumor necrosis factor-responsive transcription factor which recognizes a regulatory element in hemopoietic growth factor genes . A conserved DNA sequence element , termed cytokine 1 ( P04264 ) , is found in the promoter regions of many hemopoietic growth factor ( P14210 ) genes . Mutational analyses and modification interference experiments show that this sequence specifically binds a nuclear transcription factor , NF-GMa , which is a protein with a molecular mass of 43 kilodaltons . It interacts with different affinities with the P04264 -like sequence from a number of P14210 genes , including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) , granulocyte ( G ) - P04141 , interleukin 3 ( P08700 ) , and P05113 . We show here that the level of NF-GMa binding is induced in embryonic fibroblasts by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) treatment and that the P04264 sequence from the G- P04141 gene is a P01375 -responsive enhancer in these cells . The NF-GMa protein is distinct from another P01375 -responsive transcription factor , NF-kappa B , by several criteria . Firstly , several NF-kappa B-binding sites , although having sequence similarity with the P04264 sequence , can not compete efficiently for NF-GMa binding to P04264 . Secondly , the P04264 sequence from both G- P04141 and GM- P04141 does not respond to phorbol ester treatment as would an NF-kappa B-binding element . These results demonstrate that NF-GMa is a novel transcription factor inducible by P01375 and binds to a common element in P14210 gene promoters .
