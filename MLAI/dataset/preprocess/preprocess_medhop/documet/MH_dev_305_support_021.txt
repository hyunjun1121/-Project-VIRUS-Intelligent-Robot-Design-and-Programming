Intraepithelial CD8-positive T lymphocytes predict survival for patients with serous stage III ovarian carcinomas : relevance of clonal selection of T lymphocytes . BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic effect of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) in serous stage III ovarian carcinoma to determine Q15399 clonality and to correlate this to Her2/neu expression . METHODS : DB03843 -fixed and paraffin-embedded ovarian carcinomas were examined for P11836 - , CD3- , P01730 - and CD8-positive lymphocytes ( n=100 ) , and for Her2/neu-positive tumour cells ( n=55/100 ) by immunohistochemistry . Clonality analysis was carried out by T-cell receptor gamma ( TCRgamma ) gene rearrangements ( n=93/100 ) . Statistical analyses included experimental and clinico-pathological variables , as well as disease-free ( DFS ) and overall ( OS ) survival . RESULTS : P11836 -positive B lymphocytes were present in 57.7 % ( stromal ) /33.0 % ( intraepithelial ) and CD3-positive T lymphocytes in 99.0 % ( stromal ) /90.2 % ( intraepithelial ) of ovarian carcinomas . Intraepithelial CD3-positive T lymphocytes were correlated with improved DFS in optimally debulked patients ( P=0.0402 ) . Intraepithelial CD8-positive T lymphocytes were correlated with improved OS in all optimally debulked patients ( P=0.0201 ) and in those undergoing paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy ( P=0.0092 ) . Finally , rarified and clonal TCRgamma gene rearrangements were detected in 37 out of 93 ( 39.8 % ) and 15 out of 93 ( 16.1 % ) cases , respectively . This was marginally associated with improved DFS ( P=0.0873 ) . Despite a significant correlation of P04626 /neu status and intraepithelial CD8-positive lymphocytes ( P=0.0264 ) , this was non-directional ( R=-0.257 ; P=0.0626 ) . CONCLUSION : Improved survival of ovarian cancer patients is related to the infiltration , clonal selection and intraepithelial persistence of T lymphocytes .
