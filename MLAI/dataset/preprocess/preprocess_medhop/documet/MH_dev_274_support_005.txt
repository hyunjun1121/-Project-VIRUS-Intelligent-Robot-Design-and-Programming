Effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma agonist , DB04971 , on diabetic complications in Zucker diabetic fatty rats . This study has investigated the effects of DB04971 , a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -alpha and P37231 agonist , on the pathogenesis of diabetic complications in the Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) rats , a model of type 2 diabetes . Comparison is made with troglitazone , a P37231 agonist . The ZDF rats exhibited hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia , and developed diabetic complications such as cataract , nephropathy , and neuropathy . Treatment with DB04971 from the prediabetic stage controlled glycaemia and lipidaemia , and prevented the development of diabetic complications . DB00197 was less effective in controlling serum cholesterol and neuropathy . ZDF rats developed diabetic osteopenia with reduced bone turnover , and this was prevented by DB04971 and troglitazone , possibly mediated by increased bone turnover and bone formation . Since DB04971 controlled glycaemia and lipidaemia in ZDF rats and prevented several diabetic complications , it is suggested that treatment with DB04971 , which activates both Q07869 and P37231 , could provide a valuable therapeutic approach against diabetic complications in type 2 diabetes .
