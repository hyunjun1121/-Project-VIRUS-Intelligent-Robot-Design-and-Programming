Influence of P14416 and Q8NFD2 genotypes on apomorphine-induced growth hormone ( GH ) response in alcohol-dependent patients . BACKGROUND : D(2) receptor function can be assessed by growth hormone ( GH ) response to apomorphine . Several association studies between dopamine receptor polymorphisms and results of the apomorphine challenge test with normal and alcohol-dependent subjects yielded inconsistent results . In this pilot study , we tested polymorphisms from the P14416 region for GH response to apomorphine challenge in more detail . METHODS : DB00714 challenge tests measuring GH responses on 5 time points were performed on day 1 of alcohol detoxification in 43 patients with alcohol dependence ; patients were genotyped for 11 polymorphisms including P14416 , Q8NFD2 , P13591 and Q9H892 . RESULTS : Associations ( p < 0.05 ) were found for Q8NFD2 ( rs11604671 , rs1800497 ) and P14416 ( rs6276 , rs1076560 ) , which are located on adjacent chromosomal positions . Consistent with PET studies suggesting a reduced D(2) receptor availability in patients carrying the Q8NFD2 rs1800497 T polymorphism ( formerly known as P14416 TaqI A1 ) we found a reduced GH response to apomorphine in those subjects . CONCLUSION : This has been the first study showing significant associations between apomorphine-induced GH response and SNPs in P14416 and Q8NFD2 in alcohol-dependent patients . In this respect , our preliminary results are in line with other reports which suggested that P14416 and Q8NFD2 polymorphisms influence D(2) receptor availability and signal transduction in the dopaminergic pathways . Small sample size in our study limits the generalizability of our results .
