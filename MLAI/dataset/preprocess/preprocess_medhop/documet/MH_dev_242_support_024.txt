Safety and efficacy evaluation of ambrisentan in pulmonary hypertension . INTRODUCTION : Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance , which can lead to right heart failure and death . P05305 binding P25101 and ETB receptors seem to play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease , and oral endothelin receptor antagonists ( ERAs ) have been shown to be an effective treatment . DB00559 and P25101 -selective ambrisentan are the ERAs currently available for PAH treatment . AREAS COVERED : On the basis of the analysis of the literature , this paper addresses the efficacy and safety of ambrisentan in the treatment for PAH . EXPERT OPINION : DB06403 has shown an efficacy comparable with other ERAs . Compared with DB00559 , ambrisentan seems to have a better safety profile with regards to hepatic safety and drug-drug interactions . On the other hand , ambrisentan shows a higher rate of other adverse events , such as nasal congestion and peripheral edema . DB06403 is a viable option for PAH treatment . However , there is still a need for more robust data about long-term mortality , treatment in non-PAH pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) ( such as PH due to left heart disease and PH due to chronic hypoxic lung diseases ) and combination therapy .
