P20711 inhibition does not influence the diuretic and natriuretic response to exogenous alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide in man . The role of dopamine synthesis in the renal actions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide ( alpha P01160 ) was investigated in six dehydrated volunteers using the P20711 inhibitor carbidopa . Each subject received oral placebo or carbidopa ( 100 mg ) followed by an infusion of alpha P01160 10 pmol.kg-1.min-1 for 1 h . The responses to placebo alone and to carbidopa alone were investigated on separate occasions. alpha P01160 produced a similar increase in plasma immunoreactive alpha P01160 whether placebo or carbidopa pretreatment had been given . Urinary dopamine excretion was increased by alpha P01160 . DB00190 pretreatment substantially attenuated this increase without affecting the natriuretic or water-diuretic response to alpha P01160 . DB00190 also failed to alter the change in filtration fraction produced by alpha P01160 . The results suggest that increased synthesis of intrarenal dopamine is not required for the renal effects of alpha P01160 in man .
