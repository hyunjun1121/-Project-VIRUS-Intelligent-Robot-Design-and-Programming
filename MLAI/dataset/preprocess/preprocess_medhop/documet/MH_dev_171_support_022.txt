A common binding site on the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein for apolipoprotein B and protein disulfide isomerase . The assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins requires the formation in the endoplasmic reticulum of a complex between apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) , a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) , and protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) . In the P55157 complex , the amino-terminal region of P55157 ( residues 22-303 ) interacts with the amino-terminal region of apoB ( residues 1-264 ) . Here , we report the identification and characterization of a site on apoB between residues 512 and 721 , which interacts with residues 517-603 of P55157 . P07237 binds in close proximity to this apoB binding site on P55157 . The proximity of these binding sites on P55157 for P07237 and amino acids 512-721 of apoB was evident from studies carried out in a yeast two-hybrid system and by co-immunoprecipitation . The expression of P07237 with P55157 and apoB16 ( residues 1-721 ) in the baculovirus expression system reduced the amount of P55157 co-immunoprecipitated with apoB by 73 % . The interaction of residues 512-721 of apoB with P55157 facilitates lipoprotein production . Mutations of apoB that markedly reduced this interaction also reduced the level of apoB-containing lipoprotein secretion .
