P61968 is an essential mediator of ErbB2/ P04626 /Neu-induced breast cancer cell cycle progression . ErbB2/ P04626 /Neu-overexpressing breast cancers are characterized by poor survival due to high proliferation and metastasis rates and identifying downstream targets of ErbB2 should facilitate developing novel therapies for this disease . Gene expression profiling revealed the transcriptional regulator LIM-only protein 4 ( P61968 ) is upregulated during ErbB2-induced mouse mammary gland tumorigenesis . Although P61968 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and P61968 -overexpressing mice develop mammary epithelial tumors , the mechanisms involved are unknown . In this study , we report that P61968 is a downstream target of ErbB2 and PI3K in ErbB2-dependent breast cancer cells . Furthermore , P61968 silencing reduces proliferation of these cells , inducing a G2/M arrest that was associated with decreased cullin-3 , an E3-ubiquitin ligase component important for mitosis . Loss of P61968 subsequently results in reduced P12004 D1 and P12004 E. Further supporting a role for P61968 in modulating proliferation by regulating cullin-3 expression , we found that P61968 expression oscillates throughout the cell cycle with maximum expression occurring during G2/M and these changes precede oscillations in cullin-3 levels . P61968 levels are also highest in high-grade/less differentiated breast cancers , which are characteristically highly proliferative . We conclude that P61968 is a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in mediating ErbB2-induced proliferation , a hallmark of ErbB2-positive disease .
