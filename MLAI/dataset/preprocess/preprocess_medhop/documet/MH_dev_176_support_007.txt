DB00051 in the management of cutaneous and oral lichen planus . Lichen planus ( LP ) is a common , chronic , inflammatory dermatosis that may involve the skin as well as oral and genital mucosa . Characterized by distinctive purplish papules often featuring white reticular scale , LP commonly is resistant to treatment . My patient presented with extensive , violaceous , and lacelike whitish lesions on the distal extremities , including the hands and feet , and the vulva . Approximately 10 % to 12 % of her body surface area ( BSA ) was involved , and her condition became progressively worse over time , with thick plaques developing on the buccal mucosa and tongue . After several conventional therapies failed , the patient underwent treatment with adalimumab , a tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonist . An almost clear response was noted by week 6 , and the patient 's lesions remained almost fully resolved after week 22 . Additional studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the treatment of LP .
