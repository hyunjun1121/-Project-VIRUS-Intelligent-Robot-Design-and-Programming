Characterization of intratumoral follicular helper T cells in follicular lymphoma : role in the survival of malignant B cells . Accumulating evidences indicate that the cellular and molecular microenvironment of follicular lymphoma ( FL ) has a key role in both lymphomagenesis and patient outcome . Malignant FL B cells are found admixed to specific stromal and immune cell subsets , in particular P01730 (pos) T cells displaying phenotypic features of follicular helper T cells ( T(FH) ) . The goal of our study was to functionally characterize intratumoral P01730 (pos) T cells . We showed that P32302 (hi) Q9Y6W8 (hi) P01730 (pos) T cells sorted from FL biopsies comprise at least two separate cell populations with distinct genetic and functional features : ( i ) CD25(pos) follicular regulatory T cells ( T(FR) ) , and ( ii ) CD25(neg) T(FH) displaying a FL-B cell supportive activity without regulatory functions . Furthermore , despite their strong similarities with tonsil-derived T(FH) , purified FL-derived T(FH) displayed a specific gene expression profile including an overexpression of several genes potentially involved directly or indirectly in lymphomagenesis , in particular P01375 , P01374 , P05112 or P29965 . Interestingly , we further demonstrated that these two last signals efficiently rescued malignant B cells from spontaneous and rituximab-induced apoptosis . Altogether , our study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating P01730 (pos) T cells are more heterogeneous than previously presumed , and underlines for the first time the crucial role of T(FH) in the complex set of cellular interactions within FL microenvironment .
