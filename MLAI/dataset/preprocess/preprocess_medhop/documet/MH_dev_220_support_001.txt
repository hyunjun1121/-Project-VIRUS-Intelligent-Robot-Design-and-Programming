The role of aquaporin-1 ( P29972 ) expression in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury . A murine model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced acute lung injury ( ALI ) was used to evaluate whether aquaporin-1 ( P29972 ) is involved in lung inflammation and lung edema formation . Swiss strain mice ( n = 122 ) had LPS ( 5 mg/kg ) instilled intratracheally ( IT ) , and were then treated with either 0.9 % saline or dexamethasone ( 5 mg/kg/day ) . Mice were euthanized at 2 days and 7 days after treatment . Inflammatory cytokines ( P01375 , P05231 ) , protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid , lung wet-to-dry weight ratio , histology , immunohistochemistry , and P29972 Western blot were performed . Lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and lung vascular permeability were also measured in the P29972 knockout mice ( n = 9 ) that received IT LPS ( 5 mg/kg ) at 2 days . Intratracheal instillation of LPS produced a severe lung injury at 2 days , characterized by elevation of P01375 , P05231 in the BAL fluid , and by histological changes consistent with increased lung vascular permeability and neutrophil infiltration . P29972 -immunoreactivity in the pulmonary capillary endothelium was reduced at 2 days and 7 days . Administration of dexamethasone improved LPS-induced ALI and retained expression of P29972 . However , depletion of P29972 did not affect lung edema formation , lung vascular permeability , or lung histology . The results suggest that although P29972 expression is decreased after lung injury , depletion of P29972 does not alter lung inflammation and lung edema induced by LPS .
