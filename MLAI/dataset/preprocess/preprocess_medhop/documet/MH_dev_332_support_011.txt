De novo mutations in moderate or severe intellectual disability . Genetics is believed to have an important role in intellectual disability ( ID ) . Recent studies have emphasized the involvement of de novo mutations ( DNMs ) in ID but the extent to which they contribute to its pathogenesis and the identity of the corresponding genes remain largely unknown . Here , we report a screen for DNMs in subjects with moderate or severe ID . We sequenced the exomes of 41 probands and their parents , and confirmed 81 DNMs affecting the coding sequence or consensus splice sites ( 1.98 DNMs/proband ) . We observed a significant excess of de novo single nucleotide substitutions and loss-of-function mutations in these cases compared to control subjects , suggesting that at least a subset of these variations are pathogenic . A total of 12 likely pathogenic DNMs were identified in genes previously associated with ID ( Q8NFD5 , CHD2 , P55316 , P28472 , Q8WXI9 , Q13224 , Q9P267 , Q71F56 , Q9Y6X0 , Q16650 , TCF4 , Q9Y484 ) , resulting in a diagnostic yield of âˆ¼29 % . We also identified 12 possibly pathogenic DNMs in genes ( Q00839 , Q9BTA9 , Q92736 , Q01105 , P18146 , P35580 , Q9UL18 , Q9Y5P4 , O43633 , P62140 , Q9UN37 , Q00005 ) that have not previously been causally linked to ID . Interestingly , no case was explained by inherited mutations . Protein network analysis indicated that the products of many of these known and candidate genes interact with each other or with products of other ID-associated genes further supporting their involvement in ID . We conclude that DNMs represent a major cause of moderate or severe ID .
