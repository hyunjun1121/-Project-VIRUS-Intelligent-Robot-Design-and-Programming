Contribution of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor in the anti-metastatic P08118 -derived peptide DB04985 cell surface binding . PURPOSE : DB04985 is an anti-metastatic synthetic peptide with promising therapeutic efficacy against hormone-refractory prostate cancer . The characterization of the DB04985 peptide cell surface binding/internalization mechanisms and of the receptors involved remained to be explored . RESULTS : [(14)C] DB04985 cell surface binding assays showed rapid and transient kinetic profile , that was inhibited by RGD peptides , laminin , hyaluronan , and type-I collagen . RGD peptides were however unable to inhibit DB04985 intracellular uptake . Far-Western ligand binding studies enabled the identification of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor ( P08865 ) as a potential ligand for DB04985 . Overexpression of the recombinant P08865 indeed led to an increase in DB04985 binding but unexpectedly not to its uptake . CONCLUSIONS : Our data support the implication of laminin receptors in cell surface binding and in transducing DB04985 anti-metastatic effects , and provide a rational for targeting cancers that express high levels of such laminin receptors .
