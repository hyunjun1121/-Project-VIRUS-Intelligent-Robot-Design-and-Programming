Suppression of 3-deoxyglucosone and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor mRNA expression by an aldose reductase inhibitor in rat vascular smooth muscle cells . Reactive carbonyl compounds and oxidative stress have been recently shown to up-regulate the expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) produced by SMC themselves . Because the polyol pathway has been reported to influence the formation of carbonyl compounds and the oxidative stress in various cells , we conducted this study to investigate whether the polyol pathway affects HB- P01133 expression along with the generation of carbonyl compounds and the oxidative stress in SMCs . We found that , compared with those cultured with 5.5mM glucose , SMCs cultured with 40 mM glucose showed the accelerated thymidine incorporation , elevated levels of intracellular sorbitol , 3-deoxyglucosone ( 3-DG ) , advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) , and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) along with the enhanced expression of HB- P01133 mRNA . An aldose reductase inhibitor ( Q9Y4X5 ) , Q9NYY3 -860 , significantly inhibited all of these abnormalities , while aminoguanidine suppressed 3-DG levels and HB- P01133 mRNA expression independent of sorbitol levels . The results suggest that the polyol pathway may play a substantial role in SMC hyperplasia under hyperglycemic condition in part by affecting HB- P01133 mRNA expression via the production of carbonyl compounds and oxidative stress .
