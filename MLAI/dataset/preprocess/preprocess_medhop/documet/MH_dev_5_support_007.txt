Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer 's disease : chemokines produced by astrocytes and chemokine receptors . Chemokines secreted by astrocytes play multiple roles in the pathology of Alzheimer 's disease , a chronic inflammation disorder of central nervous system . The level of chemokines in serum , cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue and their receptors both significantly changed in patients with Alzheimer 's disease . In this review , we briefly summarized the involvement of astrocytes and chemokines in Alzheimer 's disease , and the role of chemokine/chemokine receptors in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer 's disease . Clarification of the involvement of chemokines and their receptors , such as P13500 / P41597 , fractalkine/ P49238 , SDF-1α/ P61073 , MIP-1α/ P51681 , P02778 / P49682 , P10145 / P25024 , P25025 , and RANTES/ P32246 , P51677 , P51681 , will provide a new strategy and more specific targets for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
