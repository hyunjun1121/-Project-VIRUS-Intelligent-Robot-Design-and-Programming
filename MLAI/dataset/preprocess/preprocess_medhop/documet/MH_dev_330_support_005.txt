Q92847 agonist ( DB05657 ) accelerates gastric emptying in adults with diabetes and symptomatic gastroparesis . BACKGROUND : DB05657 is a synthetic , selective ghrelin agonist in development for gastroparesis . AIM : To assess safety and effects of DB05657 in diabetes patients with symptomatic gastroparesis . METHODS : Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus received placebo and DB05657 ( 80 , 160 , 320 or 600 microg/kg ) infusions in a cross-over manner following a radiolabelled meal . Blood glucose levels were stabilized using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . Primary endpoints were gastric half emptying and latency times . Secondary measures included assessment of gastroparesis symptoms and endocrine responses . RESULTS : Ten patients with type 1 ( n = 7 ) or 2 ( n = 3 ) diabetes , moderate-to-severe gastroparesis symptoms and > or =29 % retention 4 h after a radiolabelled solid meal were enrolled . DB05657 produced significant reductions in solid meal half-emptying ( 20 % , P = 0.043 ) and latency ( 34 % , P = 0.037 ) times vs. placebo . Reductions in overall postmeal symptom intensity ( 24 % ) and postprandial fullness ( 37 % ) following DB05657 infusion were not statistically significant . Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting and there were no identifiable differences in numbers or types of adverse events between DB05657 and placebo . CONCLUSIONS : This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the ghrelin agonist DB05657 is well-tolerated in diabetes patients with moderate-to-severe chronic gastroparesis and shows statistically significant improvements in gastric emptying .
