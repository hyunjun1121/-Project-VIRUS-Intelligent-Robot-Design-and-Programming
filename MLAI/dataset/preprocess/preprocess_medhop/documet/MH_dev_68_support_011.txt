New perspectives of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 chemical characteristics in mammals and its constant expression in type 1 diabetes rat models . Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( Q05940 ) has been exploited as a biomarker of β-cell mass in human islets . However , a current report suggested no immunoreactivity of Q05940 in the β cells of rat islets . To investigate the cellular localization of Q05940 in islets further , the pancreatic tissues from monkeys and humans were compared with those of rats and mice . The study was performed using among-species comparisons and a type 1 diabetes model ( T1DM ) for rats by Western blotting , double-label immunofluorescence , and confocal laser scanning microscopy . We found that Q05940 -immunoreactivity ( IR ) was distributed peripherally in the islets of rodents , but was widely scattered throughout the islets of primates . Consistent with rodent islets , Q05940 -IR did not exist in insulin ( P01308 ) -IR cells but was abundantly present in glucagon ( GLU ) -IR and pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) -IR cells in monkey and human islets . Q05940 -IR had no colocalization with P01308 -IR in any part of the rat pancreas ( head , body , and tail ) . P01308 -IR cells were reduced dramatically in T1DM rat islets , but no significant alteration in the proportion of Q05940 -IR cells and GLU-IR cells was observed . Furthermore , a strong colocalization of Q05940 -IR with GLU-IR was distributed in the peripheral regions of diabetic islets . For the first time , the current study demonstrates the presence of Q05940 in α cells and PP cells but not in β cells in the islets of monkeys and humans . This study provides convinced morphologic evidence that Q05940 is not present in β cells . There needs to be studies for new markers for β cell mass .
