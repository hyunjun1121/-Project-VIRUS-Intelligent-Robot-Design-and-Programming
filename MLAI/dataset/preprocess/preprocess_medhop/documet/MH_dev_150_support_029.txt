N-glucuronidation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) and N_hydroxy-PhIP by specific human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases . Glucuronidation is a major metabolic pathway in the biotransformation of many xenobiotics . Recent studies have shown that in humans , UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ( P78381 ) -mediated glucuronidation plays a critical role in the detoxification of food-borne carcinogenic heterocyclic amines . 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , the most abundant carcinogenic heterocyclic amine found in well-cooked meats , has been shown to be extensively glucuronidated in humans . To determine which P78381 isozymes are involved in the biotransformation of PhIP and the cytochrome P4501A2-mediated reactive intermediate N-hydroxy-PhIP , microsomes expressing human P22309 , -1A4 , -1A6 or -1A9 were incubated with PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP and the reaction products analyzed by HPLC and P19957 -MS . Incubations containing N-hydroxy-PhIP and P22309 expressing microsomes , with an apparent Km of 4.58 microM and a Vmax of 4.18 pmol/min/mg protein , had the highest capacity to convert N-hydroxy-PhIP to N-hydroxy-PhIP-N2-glucuronide . Microsomes expressing O60656 produced N-hydroxy-PhIP-N3-glucuronide at the highest rate with an apparent Km and Vmax of 3.73 microM and 4.07 pmol/min/mg , respectively . A third previously undefined glucuronide accounted for 31 % of the total glucuronides formed from the P22310 expressing microsomes . No glucuronide conjugates were detected from microsomes expressing P19224 . Incubations containing PhIP as substrate formed direct PhIP-glucuronides in microsomes expressing P22309 , P22310 and O60656 but at levels averaging 53-fold lower than when N-hydroxy-PhIP was used as the substrate . Knowing the glucuronidation capacity of the specific P78381 isozymes involved in PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP glucuronidation should help in determining the individual susceptibility to the potential cancer risk from exposure to PhIP .
