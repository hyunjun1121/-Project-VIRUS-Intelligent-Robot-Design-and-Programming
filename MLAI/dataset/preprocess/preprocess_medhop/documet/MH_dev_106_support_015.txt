In vivo magnetomotive optical molecular imaging using targeted magnetic nanoprobes . Dynamic magnetomotion of magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs ) detected with magnetomotive optical coherence tomography ( MM- O75051 ) represents a new methodology for contrast enhancement and therapeutic interventions in molecular imaging . In this study , we demonstrate in vivo imaging of dynamic functionalized iron oxide MNPs using MM- O75051 in a preclinical mammary tumor model . Using targeted MNPs , in vivo MM- O75051 images exhibit strong magnetomotive signals in mammary tumor , and no significant signals were measured from tumors of rats injected with nontargeted MNPs or saline . The results of in vivo MM- O75051 are validated by Q9BWK5 , ex vivo MM- O75051 , DB06783 staining of histological sections , and immunohistochemical analysis of excised tumors and internal organs . The MNPs are antibody functionalized to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 neu ) protein . Fc-directed conjugation of the antibody to the MNPs aids in reducing uptake by macrophages in the reticulo-endothelial system , thereby increasing the circulation time in the blood . These engineered magnetic nanoprobes have multifunctional capabilities enabling them to be used as dynamic contrast agents in MM- O75051 and Q9BWK5 .
