Interstitial lung disease in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors . Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) refers to a diverse range of pulmonary fibrotic disorders and may be hard to accurately diagnose , as distinguishing it from other pulmonary diseases can be difficult . Estimations of the incidence in populations are confounded by the complexity of the different forms of the disorder . In addition , ILD is a comorbid disease of lung cancer and is seen after most forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced lung cancer . Incidences of > or=10 % have been reported ; however , whatever the true incidence , both chemotherapy and radiotherapy enhance the risk of developing ILD . ILD has also been reported with the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors , including erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) and gefitinib ( IRESSA ) . In a large number of gefitinib-treated patients ( n > 185,000 ) an incidence of approx 1 % has been observed ( approx 2 % in Japan ; 0.3 % in the rest of the world ) . Nevertheless , as with other treatments for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer , the clinical benefit outweighs the risk of ILD . In this article , we review the data on ILD with P00533 inhibitors and other common lung cancer treatments .
