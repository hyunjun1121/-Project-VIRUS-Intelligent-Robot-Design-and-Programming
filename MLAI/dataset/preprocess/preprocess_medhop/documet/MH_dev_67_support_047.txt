Microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibition-a novel approach to the treatment of homozygous hypercholesterolemia . Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) represents the most severe lipoprotein disorder , generally attributable to mutation(s) of the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R ) , i.e. autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia type 1 ( P07327 ) . Much lower percentages are due to alterations of apolipoprotein B ( P00325 ) , or gain-of-function mutations of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) ( P00326 ) . In certain geographical areas a significant number of patients may be affected by an autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( Q5SW96 ) . Mutations may be also combined ( two mutations of the same gene , compound heterozygosity ) , or two in different genes ( double heterozygosity ) . Among the most innovative therapeutic approaches made available recently , inhibitors of the microsomal transfer protein ( P55157 ) system have shown a high clinical potential . P55157 plays a critical role in the assembly/secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) , and its absence leads to apo B deficiency . P55157 antagonists dramatically lower LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in animals , although a reported increase of liver fat delayed their clinical development . DB08827 , the best-studied P55157 inhibitor , reduces LDL-C by 50 % or more in HoFH patients , with modest , reversible , liver steatosis . Recent US approval has confirmed an acceptable tolerability , provided patients adhere to a strictly low-fat regimen . There are no clinical data on atherosclerosis reduction/regression , but animal models provide encouraging results .
