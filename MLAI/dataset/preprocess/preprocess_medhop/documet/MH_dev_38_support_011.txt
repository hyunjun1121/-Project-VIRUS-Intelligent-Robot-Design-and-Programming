[ Differential gene expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell with reduced and normal expression of 6A8 alpha-mannosidase ] . OBJECTIVE : To detect the differential display of mRNA expression between human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell CNE-2L2 with reduced malignancy caused by transduction of a DNA antisense to 6A8 alpha-mannosidase cDNA ( AS cell ) and the wild type cell ( W cell ) . METHODS : Differential display of mRNA expression was analyzed using DNA microarray analysis . The datasets were confirmed by Northern blotting and RT-PCR . RESULTS : Out of the 1069 genes analyzed , 34 genes were up-regulated in AS cells relative to W cells . Conversely , 42 genes were down-regulated . The genes , up-regulation of which might have suppressive effect on tumor malignant behaviors , were P130 mRNA for 130K protein , TGF-betaIIR alpha , Q9UBS5 , P36897 , Q13829 , STANIN , E-CADHERIN , P35221 and 2 , P48378 , TMPO , etc . The genes , down-regulation of which might have suppressive effect on tumor malignant behaviors , were P16070 , Q92597 , P01137 , P46782 , LEGUMAIIN , P35520 , P13987 , P09661 , etc . The microarray datasets were confirmed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis . CONCLUSIONS : In comparison to the W cell , AS cell has up-regulation of 34 genes and down-regulation of 42 genes . Changes of the gene expression may play a role in the malignancy reduction of AS cell .
