DB00159 inhibits prostaglandin D2 generation by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase-2 in cultured human mast cells . BACKGROUND : DB00159 ( EPA ) is catalysed by cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) , as is arachidonic acid , and is a competitive inhibitor of arachidonate metabolism . OBJECTIVES : We examined the effect of EPA on prostaglandin ( PG ) D2 generation in the cultured human mast cells with IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation . METHODS : Cultured human mast cells were incubated with EPA ( 1 micromol/L ) for 20 h , then challenged with anti-IgE incubation after treatment with IgE . At the same time , P36551 inhibitors were tested to identify P23219 and P35354 activity . PGD2 synthetic activity was also assayed in a cell-free homogenate of cultured mast cells with P36551 inhibitors and EPA . DB11320 in the culture medium and in cells was assayed with the HPLC-fluorescent method . PGD2 and PGD3 were assayed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the stable isotope dilution method . RESULTS : Although EPA incubation did not affect histamine release by cultured human mast cells in response to IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation , it did decrease PGD2 generation by inhibiting the P35354 pathway . In contrast , in the cell-free homogenate of cultured human mast cells , EPA inhibited both P23219 and P35354 activities . CONCLUSION : Pre-incubation with EPA primarily affects the P35354 pathway in cultured human mast cells and reduces PGD2 generation in response to IgE-anti-IgE challenge incubation . These findings suggest that P23219 and P35354 have different substrate flow systems in mast cells . They also suggest that endogenous EPA diet supplementation would reduce PGD2 production and could serve as an anti-inflammatory substrate in human mast cells .
