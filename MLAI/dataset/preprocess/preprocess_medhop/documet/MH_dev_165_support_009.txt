DB01268 as a second-line therapy for advanced GISTs after failure of imatinib : relationship between efficacy and tumor genotype in Korean patients . BACKGROUND : To assess the efficacy and safety of sunitinib with regards to primary genotypes of tumor in Korean patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) who failed an initial therapy of imatinib . METHODS : Clinical data were collected from 88 consecutive patients with metastatic/unresectable GISTs treated with sunitinib at the Asan Medical Center . RESULTS : The median time-to-progression ( TTP ) and overall survival ( OS ) times were 7.1 months and 17.6 months , respectively . Of the 74 patients tested for P10721 ( exons 9 , 11 , 13 , 17 ) and P16234 ( exons 12 and 18 ) , patients with P10721 exon 9 mutant GIST ( n = 11 , 14.9 % ) showed numerically better clinical benefit ( objective response or stable disease â‰¥ 24 weeks ) rate ( 63.6 % vs 46.8 % , p = 0.504 ) and TTP ( median 13.6 mo vs 6.9 mo , p = 0.631 ) than those with P10721 exon 11 mutant GIST ( n = 47 , 63.5 % ) . The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included neutropenia ( 34.1 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 33.0 % ) and hand-foot skin reaction ( 25.0 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB01268 is an effective and safe second-line therapy for Korean patients with advanced GIST . The superior efficacy of sunitinib against GISTs with P10721 exon 9 mutations appears to be similar in Korean patients to Western experience although statistical significance was not secured .
