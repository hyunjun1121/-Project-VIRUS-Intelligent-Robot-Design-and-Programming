P2Y(12) receptor on the verge of a neuroinflammatory breakdown . In the CNS , neuroinflammation occurring during pathologies as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) and multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is the consequence of an intricate interplay orchestrated by various cell phenotypes . Among the molecular cues having a role in this process , extracellular nucleotides are responsible for intercellular communication and propagation of inflammatory stimuli . This occurs by binding to several receptor subtypes , defined P2X/P2Y , which are widespread in different tissues and simultaneously localized on multiple cells . For instance , the metabotropic Q9H244 subtype is found in the CNS on microglia , affecting activation and chemotaxis , on oligodendrocytes , possessing a hypothesized role in myelination , and on astrocytes . By comparative analysis , we have established here that Q9H244 receptor immunolabelled by antibodies against C-terminus or second intracellular loop , is , respectively , distributed and modulated under neuroinflammatory conditions on ramified microglia or myelinated fibers , in primary organotypic cerebellar cultures , tissue slices from rat striatum and cerebellum , spinal cord sections from symptomatic/end stage P00441 -G93A P35858 mice , and finally autoptic cortical tissue from progressive MS donors . We suggest that modulation of Q9H244 expression might play a dual role as analytic marker of branched/surveillant microglia and demyelinating lesions , thus potentially acquiring a predictive value under neuroinflammatory conditions as those found in P35858 and MS .
