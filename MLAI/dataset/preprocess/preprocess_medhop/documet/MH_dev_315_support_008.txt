Q9Y2D1 polymorphisms influence P39905 function and response to treatment in children with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia . DB00023 is a standard and critical component in the therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia . DB00174 synthetase ( P08243 ) and the basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 ( Q9Y2D1 ) and arginosuccinate synthase 1 ( P00966 ) have been shown to mediate the antileukemic effect of asparaginase and to display variable expression between leukemia cells that are resistant and sensitive to treatment . Fourteen polymorphisms in the regulatory and coding regions of these genes were investigated for an association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia outcome . Lower event-free survival ( O43281 ) was associated with Q9Y2D1 T1562C , tandem-repeat P08243 polymorphism , derived haplotype , and P00966 G1343T and G34T substitutions ( P ≤ .03 ) . Associations were limited to patients who received Escherichia coli asparaginase . Variations that sustained correction for multiple testing ( Q9Y2D1 T1562C , P = .005 ; P08243 tandem-repeat and related haplotype , P ≤ .01 ) were subsequently analyzed in the replication cohort . The E coli-dependent association of the Q9Y2D1 T1562 allele with reduced O43281 was confirmed ( P = .01 ) . A gene-reporter assay showed that the haplotype tagged by T1562 had higher promoter activity ( P ≤ .01 ) . The remaining regulatory polymorphisms also appeared to affect Q9Y2D1 function ; 2 additional high-activity haplotypes were identified ( P ≤ .02 ) and were further corroborated by quantitative mRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines . The Q9Y2D1 -regulated increase in P08243 expression in response to more efficacious E coli-induced asparagine depletion may explain our observed results .
