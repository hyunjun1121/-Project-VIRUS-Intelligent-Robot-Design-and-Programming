P06748 /anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( P06748 / Q9UM73 ) oncoprotein induces the T regulatory cell phenotype by activating P40763 . The mechanisms of malignant cell transformation mediated by the oncogenic , chimeric nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( P06748 / Q9UM73 ) tyrosine kinase remain only partially understood . Here we report that the P06748 / Q9UM73 -carrying T cell lymphoma ( Q9UM73 + Q9H4E5 ) cells secrete P22301 and TGF-beta and express FoxP3 , indicating their T regulatory ( Treg ) cell phenotype . The secreted P22301 suppresses proliferation of normal immune , CD3/ P10747 -stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and enhances viability of the Q9UM73 + Q9H4E5 cells . The Treg phenotype of the affected cells is strictly dependent on P06748 / Q9UM73 expression and function as demonstrated by transfection of the kinase into BaF3 cells and inhibition of its enzymatic activity and expression in Q9UM73 + Q9H4E5 cells . P06748 / Q9UM73 , in turn , induces the phenotype through activation of its key signal transmitter , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) . These findings identify a mechanism of P06748 / Q9UM73 -mediated oncogenesis based on induction of the Treg phenotype of the transformed P01730 (+) T cells . These results also provide an additional rationale to therapeutically target the chimeric kinase and/or P40763 in Q9UM73 + Q9H4E5 .
