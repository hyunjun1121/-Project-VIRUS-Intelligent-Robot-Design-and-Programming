Survey of 548 oncogenic fusion transcripts in thyroid tumors supports the importance of the already established thyroid fusions genes . Neoplasms frequently present structural chromosomal aberrations that can alter the level of expression of a protein or to the expression of an aberrant chimeric protein . In the thyroid , the Q06710 - P37231 fusion is present in the neoplastic lesions that have a follicular architecture-follicular thyroid carcinoma ( FTC ) and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( FVPTC ) , and less frequently in follicular thyroid adenoma ( DB00499 ) , while the presence of P07949 /PTC fusions are largely restricted to papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) . The ability to detect fusion genes is relevant for a correct diagnosis and for therapy . We have developed a new fusion gene microarray-based approach for simultaneous analysis of all known and predicted fusion gene variants . We did a comprehensive screen for 548 known and putative fusion genes in 27 samples of thyroid tumors and three positive controls-one thyroid cancer cell line ( TPC-1 ) and two PTCs with known Q16204 - P07949 ( alias P07949 / Q13635 ) fusion gene , using this microarray . Within the thyroid tumors tested , only well known , previously reported fusion genes in thyroid oncology were identified . Our results reinforce the pathogenic role played by P07949 / Q13635 , P07949 /PTC3 , and Q06710 - P37231 fusion genes in thyroid tumorigenesis .
