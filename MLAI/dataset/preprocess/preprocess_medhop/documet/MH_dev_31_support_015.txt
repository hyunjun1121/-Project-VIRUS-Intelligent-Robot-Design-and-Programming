[ P35354 inhibitor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , myth or reality ? ] . The discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase , Cox-1 constitutive and Cox-2 inducible , has prompted the development of new molecules with high Cox-2 selectivity . These new NSAIDs belong to the coxib class and have theoretically a better digestive tolerability than classical NSAID have . In Belgium , rofecoxib ( ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) are commercialized . DB00533 is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis ( 12.5 to 25 mg/d ) and celecoxib is indicated in osteoarthritis ( 200 mg/d ) and in rheumatoid arthritis ( 200 to 400 mg/d ) . Several studies have demonstrated their efficacy , similarly to classical NSAID as diclofenac ( Voltaren ) , naproxen ( Naprosyne ) , ibuprofen ( DB01050 ) and their superiority compared to placebo . Their safety profile for gastrointestinal events is proven in patients without ulcer history compared to classical NSAID . However , the concomitant use of aspirin decreases the benefit as demonstrated for celecoxib at 400 mg/d but not investigated for rofecoxib . The selective inhibition of Cox-2 with no effect on Cox-1 favors cardiovascular events in patients at risk . Other side effects are similar to classical NSAID . Thus Cox-2 inhibitors NSAID are interesting molecules for their sparing gastrointestinal activity . They must be used with caution in patients with ulcer history , in the elderly and in patients requiring aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis .
