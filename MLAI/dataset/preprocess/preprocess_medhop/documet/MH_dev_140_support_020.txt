New perspectives : role of sunitinib in breast cancer . DB01268 malate ( SU11248 ) is a multitarget oral tyrosine kinase receptor ( RTKs ) inhibitor which was approved by FDA in renal cells carcinoma ( RCC ) and imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intollerant gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) . DB01268 is able to inhibit RTKs such as receptors for platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF-R alpha and beta ) and for vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFRs ) . It is able to inhibit P10721 receptor , colony stimulating factor type 1 receptor ( P04141 - 1R ) , glial cell line neutrophic factor receptor ( P07949 ) , fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ( P36888 or P36888 ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) and AKT ( protein kinase B ) in tumour cells . Many sunitinib targets play important roles in growth and survival of human breast cancer ( BC ) . The " rationale " of sunitinib in BC ( with or without others antiagiogenetic therapy ) is its ability to block simultaneously intracellular portion of RTKs inhibiting many downstream signals . We overviewed the most relevant studies concerning sunitinib in metastatic BC .
