Evaluation of growth hormone ( GH ) action in mice : discovery of P10912 antagonists and clinical indications . The discovery of a growth hormone receptor antagonist ( GHA ) was initially established via expression of mutated GH genes in transgenic mice . Following this discovery , development of the compound resulted in a drug termed pegvisomant , which has been approved for use in patients with acromegaly . DB00082 treatment in a dose dependent manner results in normalization of DB01277 levels in most patients . Thus , it is a very efficacious and safe drug . Since the GH/ DB01277 axis has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancers , many have suggested the use of pegvisomant as an anti-cancer therapeutic . In this manuscript , we will review the use of mouse strains that possess elevated or depressed levels of GH action for unraveling many of GH actions . Additionally , we will describe experiments in which the GHA was discovered , review results of pegvisomant 's preclinical and clinical trials , and provide data suggesting pegvisomant 's therapeutic value in selected types of cancer .
