Reinvestigation of carrier transport properties in liquid crystalline 2-phenylbenzothiazole derivatives . We have reinvestigated the charge carrier transport properties in a liquid crystal of 2-(4'-heptyloxyphenyl)-6-dodecylthiobenzothiazole ( 7O- P10721 - P28222 ) , for which the electronic conduction was first established in rodlike liquid crystals and for which the highest hole mobility in the smectic A ( SmA ) phase ever achieved was reported . We found that 7O- P10721 - P28222 exhibited three crystal phases , one of which appeared in a limited temperature range of 10 degrees just below the phase transition temperature from the SmA phase . In this crystal phase , nondispersive transient photohole currents were observed in time-of-flight experiments , and its hole mobility was determined to be 8 x 10(-3) cm(2)/Vs , slightly higher than that reported previously in the SmA phase . For the SmA phase , however , the hole mobility was 1 x 10(-4) cm(2)/Vs . Furthermore , we established the electron transport in the SmA phase of purified 7O- P10721 - P28222 , whose mobility was the same as the hole mobility in that phase . In order to confirm generality of the new findings in 7O- P10721 - P28222 , we investigated the carrier transport properties of its derivative having a short hydrocarbon chain , 2-(4'-heptyloxyphenyl)-6-butylthiobenzothiazole ( 7O- P10721 -S4 ) , and obtained comparable results . The present results correct a mistake in the previous report and give an idea of what a typical mobility in the SmA phase is . On the basis of these results , we discuss what determines the charge carrier mobility in smectic mesophases .
