Hsp27 regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition , metastasis , and circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer . Defining the mechanisms underlying metastatic progression of prostate cancer may lead to insights into how to decrease morbidity and mortality in this disease . An important determinant of metastasis is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and the mechanisms that control the process of EMT in cancer cells are still emerging . Here , we report that the molecular chaperone Hsp27 ( P04792 ) drives EMT in prostate cancer , whereas its attenuation reverses EMT and decreases cell migration , invasion , and matrix metalloproteinase activity . Mechanistically , silencing Hsp27 decreased P05231 -dependent P40763 phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , and P40763 binding to the Twist promoter , suggesting that Hsp27 is required for P05231 -mediated EMT via modulation of P40763 /Twist signaling . We observed a correlation between Hsp27 and Twist in patients with prostate cancer , with Hsp27 and Twist expression each elevated in high-grade prostate cancer tumors . Hsp27 inhibition by DB06094 , an antisense therapy currently in phase II trials , reduced tumor metastasis in a murine model of prostate cancer . More importantly , DB06094 treatment decreased the number of circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a phase I clinical trial . Overall , this study defines Hsp27 as a critical regulator of P05231 -dependent and P05231 -independent EMT , validating this chaperone as a therapeutic target to treat metastatic prostate cancer .
