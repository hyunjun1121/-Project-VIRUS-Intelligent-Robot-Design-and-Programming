Anti- P01375 immunotherapy is associated with increased gingival inflammation without clinical attachment loss in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis . BACKGROUND : Because periodontitis presents many similarities with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) with regard to tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) -induced bone resorption , the benefits of P01375 blockade in RA prompted us to determine its efficacy in treating coexisting periodontitis . METHODS : Periodontal status was evaluated in 40 subjects with RA who were divided into two groups : Group I contained 20 subjects who had received infliximab every 6 weeks for > or =22 months at the time of periodontal evaluation . The 20 subjects in group II were evaluated before their first infusion with infliximab . Nine subjects in group II had periodontitis . These subjects were reevaluated after they received nine infusions of infliximab . RESULTS : DB00065 tended to aggravate gingival inflammation as indicated by differences in the modified gingival and papillary bleeding indices between subjects in groups I and II with coexisting periodontitis before and after treatment . DB00563 had no effect on periodontal status . Although the plaque index revealed that bacterial infection persisted , the probing depth was equal in groups I and II and equivalent before and after treatment in subjects with periodontitis , whereas attachment loss was decreased after infliximab treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Inflammation and destruction constitute two interrelated yet separate components of periodontitis in patients with RA . Therefore , P01375 blockade could be beneficial in the treatment of periodontitis .
