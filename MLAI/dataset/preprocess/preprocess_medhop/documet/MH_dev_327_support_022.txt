Compound FLZ inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory effects via down-regulation of the P50750 -IKK and P50750 -JNK/p38MAPK pathways in RAW264.7 macrophages . AIM : The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the squamosamide derivative FLZ ( N-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl-2-(2,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-acrylamide ) on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced inflammatory mediator production and the underlying mechanism in RAW264.7 macrophages . METHODS : RAW264.7 cells were preincubated with non-toxic concentrations of compound FLZ ( 1 , 5 , and 10 micromol/L ) for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 microg/L LPS . The production of nitric oxide ( NO ) , the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) , and the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B ( NF-kappaB ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways were examined . RESULTS : FLZ significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO , as well as the expression of P35228 and P35354 at both the RNA and the protein levels in RAW264.7 cells . The LPS-induced increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB and activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) , the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 , the degradation of the inhibitory kappaBalpha protein ( P25963 ) and the phosphorylation of P25963 , O15111 ( IKK ) alpha/beta , c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 MAPKs were all suppressed by FLZ . However , the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) was not affected . Further study revealed that FLZ inhibited the phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) -activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) , which is an upstream signaling molecule required for IKKalpha/beta , JNK and p38 activation . CONCLUSION : FLZ inhibited the LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators at least partly through the downregulation of the P50750 -IKK and P50750 -JNK/p38MAPK pathways .
