E3 ubiquitin ligase Q13049 negatively regulates tumor suppressor p53 to promote tumorigenesis . P04637 has a key role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis through its regulation of cellular stress responses , including apoptosis , cell cycle arrest and senescence . To ensure its proper levels and functions in cells , p53 is tightly regulated mainly through post-translational modifications , such as ubiquitination . Here , we identified E3 ubiquitin ligase Q13049 as a novel p53 target gene and negative regulator to regulate p53-mediated stress responses . In response to stress , such as DNA damage , p53 binds to the p53 responsive element in the promoter of the Q13049 gene and transcriptionally induces the expression of Q13049 in cells . In turn , Q13049 interacts with p53 and promotes p53 degradation through ubiquitination . Thus , Q13049 negatively regulates p53-mediated apoptosis , cell cycle arrest and senescence in response to stress . Q13049 is frequently overexpressed in different types of human tumors . Q13049 overexpression promotes cell oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis in mice in a largely p53-dependent manner . Taken together , our results demonstrated that as a novel p53 target and a novel negative regulator for p53 , Q13049 has an important role in regulation of p53 and p53-mediated cellular stress responses . Furthermore , our results also revealed that impairing p53 function is a novel mechanism for Q13049 in tumorigenesis .
