Modification of Q9H2A7 functions by multi-point mutations of basic amino acid residues . Q9H2A7 can function as a scavenger receptor , a chemokine and an adhesion molecule , and it could be an interesting player in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions . Our previous studies demonstrated that basic amino acid residues in the chemokine domain of Q9H2A7 are critical for its functions . In this study the combinations of the key basic amino acids in the chemokine domain of Q9H2A7 have been identified . Five combinations of basic amino acid residues that may form conformational motif for Q9H2A7 functions were selected for multi-point mutants . The double mutants of K61AR62A , R76AK79A , R82AH85A , and treble mutants of R76AR78AK79A , R78AR82AH85A were successfully constructed by replacing the combinations of two or three basic amino acid residues with alanine . After successful expression of these mutants on the cells , the functional studies showed that the cells expressing R76AK79A and R82AH85A mutants significantly increased the activity of oxLDL uptake compared with that of wild-type Q9H2A7 . Meanwhile , the cells expressing R76AK79A mutant also dramatically enhanced the phagocytotic activity of Q9H2A7 . However , the cells expressing the construct of combination of R78A mutation in R76AK79A or R82AH85A could abolish these effects . More interestingly , the adhesive activities were remarkably down regulated in the cells expressing the multi-point mutants respectively . This study revealed that some conformational motifs of basic amino acid residues , especially R76 with Q5XKE5 in Q9H2A7 , may form a common functional motif for its critical functions . R78 in Q9H2A7 has the potential action to stabilize the function of oxLDL uptake and bacterial phagocytosis . The results obtained may provide new insight for the development of drug target of atherosclerosis .
