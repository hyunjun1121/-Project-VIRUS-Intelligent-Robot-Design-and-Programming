DB09341 -stimulated translation regulation of insulin by the 5' UTR-binding proteins . P01308 is the key regulator of glucose homeostasis in mammals , and glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis is essential for maintaining glucose levels in a narrow range in mammals . DB09341 specifically promotes the translation of insulin in pancreatic β-islet , and the untranslated regions of insulin mRNA play a role in such regulation . Specific factors in the β-islets bind to the insulin 5' UTR and regulate its translation . In the present study we identify protein-disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) as a key regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis . We show that both in vitro and in vivo P07237 can specifically associate with the 5' UTR of insulin mRNA . Immunodepletion of P07237 from the islet extract results in loss of glucose-stimulated translation indicating a critical role for P07237 in insulin biosynthesis . Similarly , transient overexpression of P07237 resulted in specific translation activation by glucose . We show that the RNA binding activity of P07237 is mediated through PABP . P07237 catalyzes the reduction of the PABP disulfide bond resulting in specific binding of PABP to the insulin 5' UTR . We also show that glucose stimulation of the islets results in activation of a specific kinase that can phosphorylate P07237 . These findings identify P07237 and PABP as important players in glucose homeostasis .
