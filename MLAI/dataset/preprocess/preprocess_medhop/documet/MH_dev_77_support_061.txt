Catecholamine-related gene expression in blood correlates with tic severity in tourette syndrome . Tourette syndrome ( TS ) is a heritable disorder characterized by tics that are decreased in some patients by treatment with alpha adrenergic agonists and dopamine receptor blockers . Thus , this study examines the relationship between catecholamine gene expression in blood and tic severity . TS diagnosis was confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) -IV criteria and tic severity measured using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) for 26 un-medicated subjects with TS . Whole blood was collected and Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) processed on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays . An Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA ) identified 3627 genes correlated with tic severity ( p < 0.05 ) . Searches of Medical Subject Headings , Gene Ontology , Allen Mouse Brain Atlas , and PubMed determined genes associated with catecholamines and located in the basal ganglia . Using GeneCards , PubMed , and manual curation , seven genes associated with TS were further examined : P14416 , Q9Y5N1 , P27338 , P23560 , P60880 , P31645 , and O75751 . These genes are highly associated with TS and have also been implicated in other movement disorders , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) . Correlation of gene expression in peripheral blood with tic severity may allow inferences about catecholamine pathway dysfunction in TS subjects . Findings built on previous work suggest that at least some genes expressed peripherally are relevant for central nervous system ( CNS ) pathology in the brain of individuals with TS .
