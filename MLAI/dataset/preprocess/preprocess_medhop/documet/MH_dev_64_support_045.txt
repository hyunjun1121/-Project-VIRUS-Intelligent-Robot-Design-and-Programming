Combined Effects of Q07869 γ Agonists and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors in Human Proximal Tubule Cells . We aimed to determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibition , in addition to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 γ ) agonist , prevents high-glucose-induced proximal tubular fibrosis , inflammation , and sodium and water retention in human proximal tubule cells exposed to normal glucose ; high glucose ; high glucose with the Q07869 γ agonist pioglitazone or with the P- P00533 inhibitor , gefitinib ; or high glucose with both pioglitazone and gefitinib . We have shown that high glucose increases AP-1 and NF κ B binding activity , downstream phosphorylation of P00533 and Erk1/2 , and fibronectin and collagen IV expression . Pioglitazone reversed these effects but upregulated P48764 and P29972 expression . Gefitinib inhibited high glucose induced fibronectin and collagen IV , and P00533 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation and reversed pioglitazone-induced increases in P48764 and P29972 expression . Our data suggests that combination of an P00533 inhibitor and a Q07869 γ agonist mitigates high-glucose-induced fibrosis and inflammation and reverses the upregulation of transporters and channels involved in sodium and water retention in human proximal tubule cells . Hence P00533 blockade may hold promise , not only in limiting tubulointerstitial pathology in diabetic nephropathy , but also in limiting the sodium and water retention observed in patients with diabetes and exacerbated by Q07869 γ agonists .
