Enhanced sensitivity to the P00533 /epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib hydrochloride in chemotherapy-resistant tumor cell lines . PURPOSE : Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) is a potent and specific inhibitor of the P00533 /epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase . In phase II clinical studies , oral erlotinib monotherapy has shown antitumor activity in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer , head and neck cancer , and ovarian cancer after the failure of standard chemotherapy . We hypothesized that some tumors treated with multiple cytotoxic therapies may become more dependent on the P00533 / P00533 signaling pathways for survival . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The growth-inhibitory effect of erlotinib was tested on 10 pairs of chemosensitive , parental , and chemoresistant tumor cell lines . RESULTS : Enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib was observed in the doxorubicin-resistant human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 , paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 , and cisplatin-resistant human cervical carcinoma cell line ME180 . The IC(50) values of erlotinib in the resistant cell lines were 2- to 20-fold lower than those in the corresponding parental cell lines . This enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib correlated with higher P00533 / P00533 and phospho- P00533 / P00533 expression when compared with the corresponding parental cell lines . Acquired resistance to cytotoxic agents was not associated with cross-resistance to erlotinib . AE-ME180/ DB00515 -resistant xenografts showed greater sensitivity to erlotinib than parental ME180 xenografts did . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that acquired resistance to cytotoxic therapy in some tumors is associated with enhanced sensitivity to P00533 / P00533 inhibitors , which correlates with increased P00533 / P00533 expression . These data may explain some of the observed clinical activity of P00533 / P00533 inhibitors in patients previously treated with multiple therapies . P00533 / P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be more effective as second- or third-line treatment for certain patients with tumors that were previously treated with multiple chemotherapy regimens .
