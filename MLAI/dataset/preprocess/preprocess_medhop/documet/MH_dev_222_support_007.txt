Antivascular agents for non-small-cell lung cancer : current status and future directions . BACKGROUND : Despite improvements in surgery and chemo(radio)therapy which have allowed for modest advances in the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , survival remains poor and further improvements are needed . Attention over recent years has focused , therefore , on targeted therapies , with notable success in the development of antivascular drugs . OBJECTIVE : To summarize the current knowledge on antivascular therapy in patients with NSCLC . METHOD : Review of randomized controlled trials exploring treatment of NSCLC patients with antivascular drugs . RESULTS/CONCLUSION : DB00112 , a humanized monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , when added to cytotoxic chemotherapy , was the first treatment to prolong the overall survival of patients with advanced NSCLC beyond 12 months , a significant breakthrough in the management of advanced NSCLC . Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and alternative antivascular strategies such as P15692 -trap and vascular disrupting agents are also being investigated and have shown promise in clinical trials . This review summarizes the most recent and important findings in antivascular agents in NSCLC .
