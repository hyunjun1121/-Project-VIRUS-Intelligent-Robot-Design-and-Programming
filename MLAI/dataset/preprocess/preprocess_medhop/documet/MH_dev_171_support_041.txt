JAK inhibitors : treatment efficacy and safety profile in patients with psoriasis . Janus kinase ( JAK ) pathways are key mediators in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis . Psoriasis treatment has evolved with the advent of targeted therapies , which inhibit specific components of the psoriasis proinflammatory cascade . JAK inhibitors have been studied in early phase trials for psoriasis patients , and the data are promising for these agents as potential treatment options . DB08895 , an oral or topically administered P23458 and P52333 inhibitor , and ruxolitinib , a topical P23458 and O60674 inhibitor , have been most extensively studied in psoriasis , and both improved clinical symptoms of psoriasis . Additional P23458 or P52333 inhibitors are being studied in clinical trials . In phase III trials for rheumatoid arthritis , tofacitinib was efficacious in patients with inadequate responses to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors , methotrexate monotherapy , or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs . The results of phase III trials are pending for these therapies in psoriasis , and these agents may represent important alternatives for patients with inadequate responses to currently available agents . Further investigations with long-term clinical trials are necessary to verify their utility in psoriasis treatment and assess their safety in this patient population .
