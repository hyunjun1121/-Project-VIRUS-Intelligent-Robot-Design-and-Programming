Rationale for investigation of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in definitive treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer . Designing targeted therapies has become an important field in cancer therapeutics . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a molecular target that has gained immense attention as preclinical and clinical studies have supported its potential role for therapy of a variety of cancers , including non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and head and neck ( HN ) cancer . Several compounds that specifically inhibit P00533 have been developed , including ZD1839 , C225 , and DB00530 . Interestingly , studies suggesting a potential role for P00533 inhibitors as an adjunct to the current combined-modality approach for therapy of NSCLC and HN cancer have been performed in the preclinical and clinical setting . Therefore , determining the potential of P00533 inhibitors to improve the efficacy of standard combined-modality regimens ( chemotherapy/radiation therapy +/- surgery ) for NSCLC and HN cancer patients is of the utmost importance . An overview of the rationale and the ongoing/proposed studies aimed at determining the role for P00533 inhibitors in combination with radiation therapy for NSCLC and HN cancer patients will be presented .
