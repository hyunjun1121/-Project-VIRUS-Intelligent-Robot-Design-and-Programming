Long-term n-3 FA deficiency modifies peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta mRNA abundance in rat ocular tissues . Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors ( Q07869 ) are a FA-response system involved in diverse cellular responses . FA regulate Q07869 activity and modulate Q07869 mRNA abundance . Increasing evidence indicates that PUFA are required for optimal neuronal development and function . To gain insight into the mechanism for nutrition-induced impairment of neuronal development and function we investigated the effect of chronic n-3 FA deficiency on Q07869 mRNA levels in rat brain and ocular tissues . Rats were fed for three generations a diet designed to reduce DB01708 levels in tissues , and the abundance of PPARalpha and PPARbeta transcripts was measured by hybridization with specific probes . Chronic consumption of the a-linolenic acid ( LNA ) -insufficient diet caused a remarkable modification in DB01708 content in membrane phospholipids . The results reported here indicate that PPARa mRNA levels did not exhibit significant variation in ocular , hepatic , or nervous tissues from rats fed the experimental diet . In contrast , PPARalpha mRNA normalized to beta-actin mRNA was 21 % higher in ocular tissue from P13726 generation rats consuming the LNA-deficient diet but was independent of diet in hepatic and nervous tissues . The absolute abundance of PPARbeta transcripts showed a 17 % increase in ocular tissue from rats consuming the LNA-deficient diet ( P13726 generation ) . The biological significance of the reported changes in PPARbeta mRNA in ocular tissue remains to be determined .
