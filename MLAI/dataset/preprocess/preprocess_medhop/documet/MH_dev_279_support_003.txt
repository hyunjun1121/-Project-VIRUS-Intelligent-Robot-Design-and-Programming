P04035 inhibitor attenuates experimental autoimmune myocarditis through inhibition of T cell activation . OBJECTIVE : This study tested the hypothesis that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitor affects T cell-mediated autoimmunity through inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) and reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) . METHODS : EAM was induced in Lewis rats by immunization with myosin . High-dose or low-dose fluvastatin or vehicle was administered orally for 3 weeks to rats with EAM . RESULTS : DB01095 reduced the pathophysiological severity of myocarditis . DB01095 inhibited expression of NFkappaB in the nuclei of myocardium in EAM . DB01095 reduced production of Th1-type cytokines , including interferon ( IFN ) -gamma and interleukin ( IL ) -2 , and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in the myocardium . Infiltration of P01730 -positive T cells into the myocardium and T cell proliferative responses were suppressed by fluvastatin . Plasma lipid levels did not differ between the groups . CONCLUSIONS : DB01095 ameliorates EAM by inhibiting T cell responses and suppressing Th1-type and inflammatory cytokines via inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB , and this activity is independent of cholesterol reduction .
