The effect of MDA and DB01454 ( " DB01454 " ) isomers in combination with pirenpirone on operant responding in mice . The behaviorally disruptive effects of the optical isomers of 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-aminopropane) ( MDA ) and its N-methyl derivative ( DB01454 ) were evaluated in 27 mice trained to bar-press for a liquid food reinforcement . In addition , a second study was conducted in which mice were pretreated with either saline or the P28223 antagonist , pirenpirone , prior to the administration of either DB01454 or MDA using the same behavioral procedure . The results indicated that the behaviorally disruptive effects produced only by R(-)-MDA , but not those of S(+)-MDA , R(-)-MDA , nor of S(+)- DB01454 , were significantly attenuated by pirenpirone . These findings support previous research findings which indicate that this isomer may be producing its behaviorally disruptive effects via an action on P28223 receptors .
