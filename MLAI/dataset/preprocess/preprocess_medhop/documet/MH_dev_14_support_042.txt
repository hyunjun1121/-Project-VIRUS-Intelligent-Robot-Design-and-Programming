Is transforming growth factor-β signaling activated in human hypertrophied prostate treated by 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ? BACKGROUND AND AIM : It is well known that androgen deprivation relates to penile fibrosis , so we hypothesize that long-term treatment with 5-alphareductase inhibitors ( 5ARIs ) may increase the risk of fibrosis of prostate . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Thirty-two BPH patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate were enrolled . The patients were divided into two groups : group one , 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with tamsulosin for 2 years ; group two , 16 patients underwent TURP who had been treated with combination of tamsulosin and dutasteride for at least 1 year . We evaluated the expressions of P29475 , P35228 , P29474 , TGF-β1 , TGF-β2 , phosphorylated- Q15796 /3 ( p- Q15796 /3 ) , P12830 , P19022 , and α-smooth muscle actin in the resected prostate tissues by western blotting , and the TGF-β concentration was determined by ELISA kit . RESULTS : The expressions of 3 isoforms of NOS were significantly increased in group 2 except of P29474 in lateral prostate , and the expressions of TGF-β1 , TGF-β2 , and p- Q15796 /3 increased about 2-fold compared with group 1 . In group 2 , the P12830 expression decreased while P19022 expression increased significantly . CONCLUSIONS : The overexpression of P29475 may contribute to prostate smooth muscle relaxation ; however , long-time treatment with 5 Q9Y4X5 increases the risk of fibrosis of prostate .
