Pituitary expression of P16410 mediates hypophysitis secondary to administration of P16410 blocking antibody . Hypophysitis is a chronic inflammation of the pituitary gland of unknown ( primary forms ) or recognizable ( secondary forms ) etiology , such as the use of ipilimumab in cancer immunotherapy . DB06186 , which blocks the T cell inhibitory molecule P16410 ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 ) , induces hypophysitis in about 4 % of patients through unknown mechanisms . We first established a model of secondary hypophysitis by repeated injections of a P16410 blocking antibody into SJL/J or C57BL/6J mice , and showed that they developed lymphocytic infiltration of the pituitary gland and circulating pituitary antibodies . We next assessed the prevalence of pituitary antibodies in a cohort of 20 patients with advanced melanoma or prostate cancer , 7 with a clinical diagnosis of hypophysitis , before and after ipilimumab administration . Pituitary antibodies , negative at baseline , developed in the 7 patients with hypophysitis but not in the 13 without it ; these antibodies predominantly recognized thyrotropin- , follicle-stimulating hormone- , and corticotropin-secreting cells . We then hypothesized that the injected P16410 antibody could cause pituitary toxicity if bound to P16410 antigen expressed " ectopically " on pituitary endocrine cells . Pituitary glands indeed expressed P16410 at both RNA and protein levels , particularly in a subset of prolactin- and thyrotropin-secreting cells . Notably , these cells became the site of complement activation , featuring deposition of C3d and C4d components and an inflammatory cascade akin to that seen in type II hypersensitivity . In summary , the study offers a mechanism to explain the pituitary toxicity observed in patients receiving ipilimumab , and highlights the utility of measuring pituitary antibodies in this form of secondary hypophysitis .
