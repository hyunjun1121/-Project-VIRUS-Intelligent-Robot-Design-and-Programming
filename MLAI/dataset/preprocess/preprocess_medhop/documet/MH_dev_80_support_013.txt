P16410 blockade by a human MAb enhances the capacity of AML-derived DC to induce T-cell responses against AML cells in an autologous culture system . BACKGROUND : Cells from AML patients can differentiate into the phenotype of DC when cultured with GM- P04141 and P05112 . Such cytokine-treated AML-derived DC ( AML-DC ) can stimulate autologous T cells . In this study we examined whether an anti- P16410 MAb ( DB06186 ) could enhance the generation of autologous anti-AML T cells . METHODS : MAb DB06186 was added to AML PBMC cultures in the presence of GM- P04141 and P05112 , a previously reported AML-DC culture method of generating anti-AML T cells . T-cell activation and proliferation were examined thereafter . RESULTS : Addition of DB06186 to GM- P04141 / P05112 -conditioned AML-DC cultures induced a mean seven-fold increase in the numbers of autologous T cells compared with cultures without DB06186 ( P < 0.007 ) . T cells stimulated by AML-DC with P16410 blockade were significantly more cytotoxic towards autologous AML cells than those without DB06186 ( 42 +/- 23 % vs. 26 +/- 15 % , E:T ratio of 20 ) . T cells stimulated by AML-DC with P16410 blockade had significantly greater proportions of T cells producing P01579 in response to autologous AML cells than those cultured with AML-DC alone ( 10.7 +/- 4.7 % vs. 4.5 +/- 2.4 % for P01730 + P01579 + Q07108 + and 9.8 +/- 4.1 % vs. 4 +/- 2.1 % for CD8+ P01579 + Q07108 + with or without DB06186 ; n = 7 ; P < 0.007 , P < 0.003 , respectively ) . DISCUSSION : P16410 blockade enhances the activity and numbers of AML-reactive T cells that can be stimulated by autologous AML-DC and may enhance the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of AML .
