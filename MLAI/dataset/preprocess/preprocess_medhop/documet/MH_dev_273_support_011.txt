BIO5192 , a small molecule inhibitor of VLA-4 , mobilizes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells . Here we show that interruption of the P19320 /VLA-4 axis with a small molecule inhibitor of VLA-4 , BIO5192 , results in a 30-fold increase in mobilization of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitors ( HSPCs ) over basal levels . An additive affect on O14818 mobilization ( 3-fold ) was observed when plerixafor ( DB06809 ) , a small molecule inhibitor of the P61073 / P48061 axis , was combined with BIO5192 . Furthermore , the combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) , BIO5192 , and plerixafor enhanced mobilization by 17-fold compared with G- P04141 alone . HSPCs mobilized by BIO5192 or the combination of BIO5192 and plerixafor mobilized long-term repopulating cells , which successfully engraft and expand in a multilineage fashion in secondary transplantation recipients . Splenectomy resulted in a dramatic enhancement of G- P04141 -induced mobilization while decreasing both plerixafor- and BIO5192-induced mobilization of HSPCs . These data provide evidence for the utility of small molecule inhibitors of VLA-4 either alone or in combination with G- P04141 or DB06809 for mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells .
