Effects of early maternal separation on biobehavioral and neuropathological markers of Alzheimer 's disease in adult male rats . Stress has been described as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer´s disease ( AD ) . In the present work we aim to study the validity of an experimental model of neonatal chronic stress in order to recapitulate the main hallmarks of AD . Male Wistar rats that were separated daily from the dam during the first 3 weeks of life ( maternal separation , MS ) showed in adulthood cognitive deficits novel object recognition test . In the hippocampus of MS rats , increases in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels , the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD , were accompanied by increased expression of the cleaving enzyme P56817 . Hyperphosphorylation of Tau associated to increased activation of the tau kinase P45983 was also found . Decreased cell number in the hippocampus was observed in stressed rats , as a consequence of both decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptotic death . Decreases in P23560 and in the synaptic markers synaptophysin and P78352 were also found in MS rats . All these effects could be related to an Q9Y251 axis hyperactivity , as reflected in significant increases in corticosterone levels and decreases in glucocorticoid receptor expression . Further , SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with corticosterone showed increased P56817 , pTau and pJNK1 expression . In addition , venlafaxine , an antidepressant able to modulate Q9Y251 axis activity , reversed all the above cited deleterious effects of chronic stress , both in vivo and in vitro . It is proposed that the MS model can be considered as an appropriate experimental model for the study of sporadic AD .
