The tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the novel antimigraine compound DB00315 in healthy male volunteers . 1. DB00315 is a novel and selective agonist at P28221 receptors , with central and peripheral actions , currently in development for the acute oral treatment of migraine . 2 . The pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles of single oral doses from 1-50 mg DB00315 were investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating study . 3 . DB00315 was well tolerated with most adverse experiences of mild and transient nature . 4 . Absorption was rapid with dose-independent kinetics . Median tmax was 2-4 h although 50-85 % of eventual Cmax was attained within 1 h . The t1/2 was 2.5-3 h with a high apparent plasma clearance ( CL/F > 2000 ml min-1 ) and apparent volume of distribution ( Vz/F ) of 400-500 l . 5 . Three metabolites were detected in plasma and urine , one of which , the N-desmethyl metabolite , has P28221 agonist activity . 6 . DB00315 showed no clinically significant effects on blood pressure , heart rate , ECG or laboratory variables at any dose and demonstrated a tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile compatible with an acute oral migraine treatment .
