Targeted therapeutic approach for an anaplastic thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo . Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( ATC ) is among the most aggressive human malignancies , being responsible for the majority of thyroid cancer-related deaths . Despite multimodal therapy including surgery , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy , the outcome of ATC is poor . The human ATC cell line MB1 , derived from tumor tissue of a 57-year-old man with thyroid cancer and pronounced neutrophilia , was established from surgically excised tumor tissue . The karyotype of the cell line shows many chromosomal abnormalities . Preclinical investigations have shown antitumor activity and effectiveness of the P15056 kinase inhibitor DB00398 and the proteasome inhibitor DB00188 . After establishment of the MB1 cell line these agents were applied in vitro and , showing activity in a cell culture model , were also used for in vivo treatment . DB00398 had some clinical effect , namely normalization of leucocytosis , but had no sustained impact on subsequent tumor growth and development of distant metastasis . Molecular diagnostics of the tumor demonstrated no P15056 mutations in exons 11 and 15 concordant with a rather modest effect of DB00398 on MB1 cell growth . Clinical benefit was seen with subsequent bortezomib therapy inducing a temporary halt to lymph node growth and a progression-free interval of 7 weeks . Our observations together with previous data from preclinical models could serve as a rationale for selecting those patients suffering from ATC most likely to benefit from targeted therapy . A prospective controlled randomized trial integrating kinase and proteasome inhibitors into a therapeutic regime for ATC is warranted .
