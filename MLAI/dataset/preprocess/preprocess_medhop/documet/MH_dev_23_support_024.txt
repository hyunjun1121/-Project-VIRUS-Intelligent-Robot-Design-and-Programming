Connexin 43 and P29323 regulate tension-induced signal transduction in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts . Periodontal ligament ( PDL ) fibroblasts play an important role in preserving periodontal homeostasis and transmitting mechanical signals to alveolar bone . Connexin 43 ( P17302 ) , a gap junction protein , is essential for bone homeostasis and regulates bone remodeling . However , the function of P17302 in human PDL fibroblast-regulated bone remodeling has not yet been elucidated . In this study , human PDL fibroblasts were exposed to cyclic mechanical tension with a maximum 5 % elongation for different durations . We then examined the expression of signaling molecules related to osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis at both the mRNA and protein levels as well as the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in human PDL fibroblasts after loading . We found that mechanical tension increased P17302 , which further upregulated osteogenic ( e.g. , Q13950 , Osterix , and O00300 ) and down-regulated osteoclastogenic ( e.g. , O14788 ) signaling molecules . Suppressing P17302 gene ( Gja1 ) by siRNA inhibited the increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced O14788 expression . Similar to P17302 , activated P27361 /2 was also enhanced by mechanical tension and suppressed by P17302 siRNA . Inhibition of P27361 /2 signaling using PD98059 reduced the tension-regulated increase in osteogenesis-related molecules but enhanced that of osteoclastogenesis-related ones . These findings suggest that cyclic tension may involve into the osteogenic or osteoclastogenetic differentiation potential of human PDL fibroblasts via the P17302 - P27361 /2 signaling pathway .
