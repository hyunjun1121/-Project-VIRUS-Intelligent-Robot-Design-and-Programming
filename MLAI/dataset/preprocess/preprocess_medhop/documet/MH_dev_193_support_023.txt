A study of natural killer cell lectin-like receptor P04264 gene ( P26718 / P26718 ) region polymorphisms in a European population sample . Recent evidence has reinforced the belief in immunosurveillance as a powerful mechanism against cancer development . The natural killer ( NK ) cell has been recognized as a potent agent of cancer immunosurveillance . A Japanese cohort study correlated natural cytotoxic activity levels with subsequent cancer development and identified NK cell lectin-like receptor P04264 gene ( P26718 / P26718 ) polymorphisms as genetic markers of cancer predisposition . In the present study , we genotyped 82 reference cell lines and 388 newborn samples at 10 P26718 region variants by TaqMan ( ( R ) ) allelic discrimination assays and showed that the same polymorphisms occur at similar frequencies in Europeans . The same haplotype block that has been associated with lower natural cytotoxic activity also occurred with the highest frequency in our sample . We further detected evidence suggestive of natural selection at some of the loci analyzed and more importantly , sex specificity of this selection . It appeared that heterozygosity at loci forming a haplotype block was unfavorable for boys . Given the relevance of NK cells in fetal survival , this finding has potential implications in the study of genetics of maternofetal recognition . Our preliminary findings are of marginal statistical significance and should be replicated in a larger sample . We believe that our results will increase awareness of the involvement of P26718 in cancer immunosurveillance and possibly in prenatal selection .
