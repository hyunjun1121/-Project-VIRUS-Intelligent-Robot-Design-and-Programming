Dietary soy protein isolate attenuates metabolic syndrome in rats via effects on Q07869 , LXR , and SREBP signaling . To determine the effects of feeding soy or isoflavones on lipid homeostasis in early development , weanling rats were fed AIN-93G diets made with casein , soy protein isolate ( SPI+ ) , isoflavone-reduced SPI+ ( SPI- ) , or casein supplemented with genistein or daidzein for 14 d . PPARalpha-regulated genes and proteins involved in fatty acid degradation were upregulated by SPI+ ( P < 0.05 ) accompanied by increased promoter binding and expression of PPARalpha mRNA ( P < 0.05 ) . Feeding SPI- or pure isoflavones did not alter PPARalpha-regulated pathways . SPI+ feeding had similar effects on PPARgamma signaling . SPI+ , SPI- , and casein plus isoflavones all increased liver Q9UBH6 (LXR)alpha-regulated genes and enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis . Feeding SPI+ increased promoter binding of LXRalpha , expression of the transcription factor mRNA , and protein ( P < 0.05 ) . In a second experiment , male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed casein diets from postnatal d ( P01160 ) 24 to PND64 or were fed high-fat Western diets containing 5 g x kg(-1) cholesterol made with either casein or SPI+ . P01308 resistance , steatosis , and hypercholesterolemia in the Western diet-fed rats were partially prevented by SPI+ ( P < 0.05 ) . Nuclear sterol receptor element binding protein ( SREBP ) -1c protein and mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis were increased by feeding Western diets containing casein but not SPI+ ( P < 0.05 ) . These data suggest that activation of Q07869 and LXR signaling and inhibition of SREBP-1c signaling may contribute to insulin sensitization and improved lipid homeostasis in SPI+-fed rats after consumption of diets high in fat and cholesterol .
