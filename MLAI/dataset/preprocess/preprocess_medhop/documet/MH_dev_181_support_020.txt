Further evidence that central tachykinin NK-1 receptors mediate the inhibitory effect of tachykinins on angiotensin-induced drinking in rats . The order of potency of tachykinin ( TK ) receptor agonists suggests that TK NK-1 receptors mediate their inhibitory effect on water intake induced by intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v. ) injection of angiotensin II ( AngII ) in rats . The present study was aimed at further evaluating which TK receptor subtype mediates the effect , using selective antagonists for the TK receptor subtypes . Pulse i.c.v. injection of the TK agonist neuropeptide gamma ( NP gamma ) , 31-250 ng/rat , markedly inhibited AngII-induced water intake . The i.c.v. injection of the P25103 antagonist SR14033 , 0.5 microgram/rat , significantly reduced , while 1 microgram/rat completely abolished the inhibitory effect of NP gamma , 125 ng/rat . The selective P21452 antagonist SR48968 and the selective P29371 antagonist R820 were devoid of any effect up to the i.c.v. dose of 2 micrograms/rat . On the other hand , i.c.v. injection of SR140333 , 1 microgram/rat , did not increase drinking induced by i.c.v. injection of AngII , 0.1-10 ng/rat , and did not increase drinking in water sated or water deprived rats . The results of the present study confirm that central TKergic mechanisms inhibit AngII-induced drinking in rats , and provide further evidence that TK NK-1 receptors mediate the effect . Failure of i.c.v. injected DB05790 to increase AngII-induced drinking , as well as water intake in sated or deprived rats suggests that brain P25103 mechanisms apparently do not exert a tonic control on AngII-induced drinking and , in general , on water intake in rats . From a pharmacological point of view , the inhibitory effect of TKs on the dipsogenic action of AngII can represent a functional test for activity at central NK-1 receptors in rats .
