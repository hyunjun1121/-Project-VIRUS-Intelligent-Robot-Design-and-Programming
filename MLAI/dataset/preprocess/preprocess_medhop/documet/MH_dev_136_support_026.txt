Effect of clopidogrel on circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and endothelial activation . Angiogenic cytokines have been shown to influence vessel injury , and platelets represent a disposable circulating pool of angiogenic molecules . In the present study , objectives were to determine whether clopidogrel could have a potential effect on levels of circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and endothelial activation . We explored 28 healthy white male volunteers treated for 7 days with clopidogrel 75 mg/day . We quantified angiogenic growth factors that have been shown to be correlated to cardiovascular risk or endothelial progenitor cell mobilization such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -A and its soluble receptor forms P17948 and P35968 , placenta growth factor , and stromal cell-derived factor-1 . We also quantified soluble P16581 and P04275 to evaluate endothelial activation . Blood samples were drawn just before the first clopidogrel intake on day 1 , and after the last dosing ( day 7 ) . As expected , we observed a decrease in platelet reactivity in response to clopidogrel , confirmed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay . However , the 7-day intake of clopidogrel did not significantly modify the levels of the selected angiogenic factors or biomarkers of endothelial activation . These results show that circulating angiogenic factor level in healthy subjects is not driven by Q9H244 platelet receptor-induced activation and clopidogrel does not modify in a significant way the endothelial activation level .
