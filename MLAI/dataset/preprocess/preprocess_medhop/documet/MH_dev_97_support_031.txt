Wistar rats : a forgotten model of age-related hearing loss . Age-related hearing loss ( ARHL ) is one of the most frequent sensory impairments in senescence and is a source of important socio-economic consequences . Understanding the pathological responses that occur in the central auditory pathway of patients who suffer from this disability is vital to improve its diagnosis and treatment . Therefore , the goal of this study was to characterize age-related modifications in auditory brainstem responses ( Q12979 ) and to determine whether these functional responses might be accompanied by an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in the cochlear nucleus of Wistar rats . To do so , Q12979 recordings at different frequencies and immunohistochemistry for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 ( Q9P2U7 ) and the vesicular GABA transporter ( Q9H598 ) in the ventral cochlear nucleus ( VCN ) were performed in young , middle-aged and old male Wistar rats . The results demonstrate that there was a significant increase in the auditory thresholds , a significant decrease in the amplitudes and an increase in the latencies of the Q12979 waves as the age of the rat increased . Additionally , there were decreases in Q9P2U7 and Q9H598 immunostaining in the VCN of older rats compared to younger rats . Therefore , the observed age-related decline in the magnitude of auditory evoked responses might be due in part to a reduction in markers of excitatory function ; meanwhile , the concomitant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory markers might reflect a common central alteration in animal models of ARLH . Together , these findings highlight the suitability of the Wistar rat as an excellent model to study ARHL .
