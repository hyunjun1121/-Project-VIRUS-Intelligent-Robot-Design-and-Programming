Identification of N-(4-piperidinyl)-4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide ( DB05037 ) , a novel cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor using fragment-based X-ray crystallography and structure based drug design . The application of fragment-based screening techniques to cyclin dependent kinase 2 ( P24941 ) identified multiple ( > 30 ) efficient , synthetically tractable small molecule hits for further optimization . Structure-based design approaches led to the identification of multiple lead series , which retained the key interactions of the initial binding fragments and additionally explored other areas of the DB00171 binding site . The majority of this paper details the structure-guided optimization of indazole ( 6 ) using information gained from multiple ligand- P24941 cocrystal structures . Identification of key binding features for this class of compounds resulted in a series of molecules with low nM affinity for P24941 . Optimisation of cellular activity and characterization of pharmacokinetic properties led to the identification of 33 ( DB05037 ) , which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers .
