A pharmacokinetic and clinical assessment of tofacitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . INTRODUCTION : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic painful and debilitating autoimmune disease . Although the outcome for patients with RA has improved markedly in the past decades , driven largely by the advent of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) and updated management strategies , adequate disease control can not be achieved in a substantial proportion of patients . Since RA is a syndrome with different biological subsets , DMARDs , with a novel mechanism of action , may represent a valuable addition to the current armamentarium . DB08895 is a novel synthetic DMARD that selectively inhibits Janus kinases ( JAKs ) , particularly P23458 and P52333 . AREAS COVERED : This review describes the pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib . Furthermore , the article summarizes and comments the drug 's efficacy and safety profile in RA patients . The authors furthermore assess data derived from the FDA 's RA development program . EXPERT OPINION : DB08895 is an oral synthetic DMARD displaying linear pharmacokinetics . Metabolism , primarily mediated by P08684 , accounts for 70 % of the total clearance of the drug ; the remaining 30 % are renally excreted . DB08895 monotherapy , or in combination with traditional DMARDs , has demonstrated its efficacy while having an acceptable safety profile in RA patients who have responded inadequately to current DMARDs , including P01375 antagonists . In view of its undetermined benefit to risk ratio , in the real-world population , tofacitinib should , for now , only be prescribed to selected patients .
