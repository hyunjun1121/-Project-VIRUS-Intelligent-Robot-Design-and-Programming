Construction of a steric map of the binding pocket for cannabinoids at the cannabinoid receptor . In order to gain information about the topology of the brain cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) , a Receptor Steric ( RS ) Map for cannabinoids at this receptor was calculated . The classical cannabinoids (-)-11-hydroxy- DB00470 ( P04264 = 210 +/- 56 nM ) , (-)-9-nor-9-beta-hydroxy-hexahydrocannabinol ( P04264 = 124 +/- 17 nM ) , nabilone ( P04264 = 120 +/- 13 nM ) , and the non-classical cannabinoid , CP-55,244 ( P04264 = 1.4 +/- .3 nM ) were used as template molecules . The RS map was obtained as the union of the van der Waals ' volumes of only those accessible conformers identified by P08253 calculations that were able to clear a region of steric interference at the P21554 receptor previously characterized by us [ Reggio , P.H. , Panu , A.M. and Miles , S. ( 1993 ) , J. Med. Chem. , 36 , 1761-1771 ] . The utility of the RS Map was explored by screening the accessible conformers of the classical cannabinoid , cannabinol ( CBN ) , ( P04264 = 3200 +/- 450 nM ) , for its ability to fit within the RS map . Only the global minimum energy conformer of CBN ( 53.2 % abundance at 298K ) was able to fit within the RS map . These results imply that one reason for the reduced affinity of CBN may be that only 53.2 % of CBN molecules are shaped properly to fit in the binding pocket for cannabinoids at the P21554 receptor .
