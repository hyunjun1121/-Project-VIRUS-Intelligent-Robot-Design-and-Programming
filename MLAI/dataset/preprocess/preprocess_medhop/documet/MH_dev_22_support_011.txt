DB06366 protects the achilles ' heel of trastuzumab -- emtansine . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) represents a significant advancement in the treatment of P04626 (+) breast cancers . Its clinical efficacy however will be limited by the development of therapeutic resistance . In this report , the P21860 ligand neuregulin is shown to mediate DB05773 resistance , which was overcome by administration of pertuzumab , a steric inhibitor of P04626 dimerization .
