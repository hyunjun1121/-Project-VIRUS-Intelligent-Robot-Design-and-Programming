Immunohistochemical localization of adherens junction components in blood-brain barrier microvessels of the rat . The morphology and molecular composition of intercellular adherens junctions have most frequently been described in epithelial cells and the fascia adhaerens of the intercalated disc . A group of cytoplasmic molecules is known to be associated with adherens junctions . The intercellular bond is mediated by cadherins which bridge the cells by homophilic binding . Recently , endothelial cells have also been shown to form intercellular junctions of the adherens-type . However , they are morphologically less distinct and little is known about their molecular components . In this study we report the localization of some adherens junction components in intact microvessels of the blood-brain barrier in the rat . We used antibodies raised against alpha-actinin , vinculin , zyxin , cadherin ( antipan-cadherin antibody ) and A- P62158 ( P19022 ) in immunohistochemical experiments at light and electron microscopical levels . Microvessel walls reacted positively for all antigens throughout postnatal development . All antigens were localised , though not necessarily exclusively , to interendothelial junctions . At the ultrastructural level , pan-cadherin reactivity was present throughout the entire length of the cleft . These results could mean that in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells the complex tight junction is embedded in an adherens junction which occupies the entire length of the cleft .
