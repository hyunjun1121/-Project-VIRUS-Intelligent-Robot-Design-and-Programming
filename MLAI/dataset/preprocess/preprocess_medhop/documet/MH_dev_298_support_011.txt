DB00114 ( PLP ) deficiency might contribute to the onset of type I diabetes . The incidence of type I diabetes is rising worldwide , particularly in young children . Type I diabetes is considered a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition and environmental factors participating . Currently , despite years of research , there is no consensus regarding the factors that initiate the autoimmune response . Type I diabetes is preceded by autoimmunity to islet antigens , among them the protein glutamic acid decarboxylase , Q05329 . DB00114 ( PLP ) is formed from vitamin B6 by the action of pyridoxal kinase . Interaction of Q05329 with PLP is necessary for Q05329 -mediated synthesis of the neurotransmitter Î³-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) . PLP is also a required cofactor for dopamine synthesis by L-aromatic decarboxylase ( L- P20711 ) . Both Q05329 and L- P20711 are expressed in pancreatic islets . Here it is proposed that lack of the vitamin B6 derivative pyridoxal 5'-phosphate might contribute to the appearance of pancreatic islet autoimmunity and type I diabetes onset .
