Gene clustering analysis in human osteoporosis disease and modifications of the jawbone . OBJECTIVE : An analysis of the genes involved in both osteoporosis and modifications of the jawbone , through text mining , using a web search tool , of information regarding gene/protein interaction . DESIGN : The final set of genes involved in the present phenomenon was obtained by expansion-filtering loop . Using a web-available software ( STRING ) , interactions among all genes were searched for , and a clustering procedure was performed in which only high-confidence predicted associations were considered . RESULTS : Two hundred forty-two genes potentially involved in osteoporosis and in modifications of the jawbone were recorded . Seven " leader genes " were identified ( P35222 , P01584 , P05231 , P05412 , Q13950 , P10451 , P01137 ) , while another 10 genes formed the cluster B group ( P12643 , P18075 , P02452 , P05362 , IGF1 , P22301 , P14780 , P19838 , O14788 , P15692 ) . Ninety-eight genes had no interactions , and were defined as " orphan genes " . CONCLUSIONS : The expansion of knowledge regarding the molecular basis causing osteoporotic traits has been brought about with the help of a de novo identification , based on the data mining of genes involved in osteoporosis and in modification of the jawbone . A comparison of the present data , in which no role was verified for 98 genes that had been previously supposed to have a role , with that of the literature , in which another 81 genes , as obtained from GWAS reviews and meta-analyses , appeared to be strongly associated with osteoporosis , probably attests to a lack of information on osteoporotic disease .
