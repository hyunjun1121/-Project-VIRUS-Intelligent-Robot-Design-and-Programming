Myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in hypertensive and heart failure-prone rats . Acute increases in blood pressure ( BP ) increase myocardial tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production , but it is not known whether chronic hypertensive stress elevates myocardial P01375 production , possibly contributing to cardiac remodeling , decreased cardiac function , and faster progression to heart failure . BP , cardiac function , and size were evaluated in normotensive [ Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) ] , spontaneously hypertensive ( SHR ) , and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure-prone ( SHHF ) rats at 6 , 12 , 15 , and 18 mo of age and in failing SHHF . Left ventricular tissues were evaluated for secretion of bioactive P01375 and inhibition of P01375 secretion by phosphodiesterase inhibitors . All ventricles secreted bioactive and immunoreactive P01375 , but secretion decreased with age . SHR and SHHF rats secreted more P01375 than SD rats at 6 mo of age , but only failing SHHF rats secreted significantly more P01375 at 18 mo . DB01427 inhibited P01375 secretion in all rats and was less potent but more efficacious than RO-201724 in all strains . P01375 secretion correlated with BP and left ventricular mass in 6-mo-old rats , but this relationship disappeared with age . Results suggest that hypertension and/or cardiac remodeling is associated with elevated myocardial P01375 , and , although hypertension , per se , did not maintain elevated cardiac P01375 levels , SHHF rats increase P01375 production during the end stages of failure .
