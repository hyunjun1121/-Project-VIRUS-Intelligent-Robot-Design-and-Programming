P62158 -mediated effects of loperamide on chloride transport by brush border membrane vesicles from human ileum . We investigated whether the synthetic opiate loperamide-HCl is able to regulate specific transport systems for sodium and chloride in brush border membrane vesicles ( BBMVs ) from human ileum and whether such activities are mediated by calcium/calmodulin . In BBMVs we studied Na+/H+ antiport , Cl+/OH- antiport , Na+/Cl- cotransport , and the Cl- conductive pathway . Brush border membrane vesicles were incubated with 10 microM loperamide over 4 h at 5 degrees C before the uptake experiments . In ileal BBMVs , loperamide stimulated intravesicular accumulation of Na+ in the presence of Cl- and vice versa . After 1 min of incubation , the stimulatory effect was 35 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) of the control without loperamide . DB00836 also stimulated Cl-/OH- antiport by 30 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) in BBMVs of ileum . In addition , we studied the role of Ca2+/calmodulin in the action of loperamide on chloride transport by human BBMVs . In loperamide-pretreated BBMVs , calmodulin activity was significantly decreased ( 12 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein ) . When loperamide-pretreated vesicles were incubated with 2 microM calcium ( free concentration ) plus 5 microM calmodulin for 1 h at 5 degrees C , complete inhibition of the stimulatory effect of loperamide on Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport was observed . Increasing the Ca2+/calmodulin activity of loperamide-pretreated BBMVs with 2 microM calcium plus 5 microM calmodulin led to a significant inhibition of Cl-/OH- antiport and Na+/Cl- cotransport by 40 % +/- 5 % ( p less than 0.005 ) .
