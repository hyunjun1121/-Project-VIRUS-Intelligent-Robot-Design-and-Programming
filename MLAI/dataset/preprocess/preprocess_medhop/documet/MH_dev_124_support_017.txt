A homozygous inactivating calcium-sensing receptor mutation , Pro339Thr , is associated with isolated primary hyperparathyroidism : correlation between location of mutations and severity of hypercalcaemia . BACKGROUND : Inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) , a G-protein-coupled receptor with extracellular ( O95905 ) , transmembrane ( TMD ) and intracellular ( ICD ) domains , cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia , neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism and occasionally primary hyperparathyroidism in adults . OBJECTIVE : To investigate a patient with typical symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism for P41180 abnormalities . PATIENT AND DESIGN : A 51-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism was investigated for P41180 abnormalities as her severe hypercalcaemia ( 3·75 mm ) persisted after the removal of two large parathyroid adenomas and she was the daughter of normocalcaemic consanguineous parents . Following informed consent , P41180 mutational analysis was undertaken using leucocyte DNA . Wild-type and mutant P41180 constructs were expressed in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells and assessed by measuring their intracellular calcium responses to changes in extracellular calcium . Clinical data were pooled with previous studies to search for genotype-phenotype correlations . RESULTS : The proband was homozygous for a Pro339Thr P41180 missense mutation , located in the O95905 , and her normocalcaemic relatives were heterozygous . The mutant Thr339 P41180 had a rightward shift in its dose-response curve with a significantly higher EC(50) = 3·18 mm ± 0·19 compared to the wild-type EC(50) = 2·16 mm ± 0·1 ( P < 0·01 ) , consistent with a loss-of-function mutation . An analysis of P41180 mutations in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism revealed that those of the O95905 were associated with a significantly greater hypercalcaemia that was less likely to be corrected after removal of the parathyroid tumours . CONCLUSIONS : A P41180 missense mutation causing a loss-of-receptor-function can cause symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism in adulthood .
