Inhibition of noradrenaline release via presynaptic P28222 receptors of the rat vena cava . In the rat inferior vena cava preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline , the effects of nine serotonin ( 5-HT ) receptor agonists and of eight antagonists ( including two beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents ) on the electrically evoked 3H overflow were determined . 1 . 5-HT , 5-carboxamido-tryptamine , 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)-1H-indole ( RU 24969 ) , 5-methoxytryptamine , N,N-dimethyl-5HT , tryptamine and 5-aminotryptamine inhibited the evoked 3H overflow . The potencies of these agonists in inhibiting overflow were significantly correlated with their affinities for P28222 binding sites , but not with their affinities for P08908 , P28335 or 5-HT2 binding sites . 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , a P08908 receptor agonist , and ipsapirone , a partial agonist at these receptors , did not inhibit overflow . 2 . Cyanopindolol facilitated the evoked 3H overflow , an effect which was abolished by propranolol . The maximum inhibition of overflow obtainable with 5-HT was diminished by cyanopindolol . 3 . The concentration-response curve for 5-HT was shifted to the right by metitepine , metergoline , quipazine , 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine ( MK 212 ) and propranolol which , given alone , did not affect 3H overflow . The apparent pA2 values of these antagonists tended to be correlated with their affinities for P28222 ( but not P08908 , P28335 or 5-HT2 ) binding sites . Ketanserin , a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist , and spiperone , which blocks 5-HT2 and P08908 but not P28222 or P28335 receptors , failed to antagonize the effect of 5-HT.
