Identification of genes associated with enhanced metastasis of a large cell lung carcinoma cell line . We have compared the transcriptional profile of large cell lung tumor cell lines NIH-H460 and H460-M making use of the Affymetrix GeneChip system . H460-M is derived from NIH-H460 and displays enhanced experimental and spontaneous metastasis in nude mice . Out of the 12,600 genes investigated , 73 ( 0.6 % ) were up-regulated and 114 ( 0.9 % ) were down-regulated on the basis of the scoring criteria . We have classified the de-regulated genes according to the following categories : immune response , enzymes , modulation of transcription , signal transduction , cytoskeleton/adhesion and extracellular matrix associated proteins , cell-cycle/apoptosis , transporters and ' others ' . Among the remarkable features of this system are the up-regulation of the steady-state mRNA levels of neuroendocrine markers such as neurotensin ( P30990 ) , neuroendocrine-specific protein ( NSP ) , neural cell adhesion molecule 1 ( P13591 ) and gamma-aminobutyric acid B-type receptor ( O75899 ) in cell line H460-M . Semaphorin 3B ( Q13214 ) was dramatically down-regulated in cell line H460-M and emerged as the most interesting gene for target validation .
