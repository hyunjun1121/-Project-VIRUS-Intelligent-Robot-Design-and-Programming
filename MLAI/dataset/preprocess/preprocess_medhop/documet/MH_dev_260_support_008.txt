Genetically rescued tetrahydrobiopterin-depleted mice survive with hyperphenylalaninemia and region-specific monoaminergic abnormalities . One of the possibly mutated genes in DOPA-responsive dystonia ( DRD , Segawa 's disease ) is the gene encoding P30793 , which is the rate-limiting enzyme for tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) biosynthesis . Based on our findings on 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase ( Q03393 ) gene-disrupted ( Pts(-/-) ) mice , we suggested that the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) protein in dopaminergic nerve terminals is regulated by the intracellular concentration of BH4 . In this present work , we rescued Pts(-/-) mice by transgenic introduction of human Q03393 cDNA under the control of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase promoter to examine regional differences in the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to BH4-insufficiency . The DPS-rescued ( Pts(-/-) , DPS ) mice showed severe hyperphenylalaninemia . Human Q03393 was efficiently expressed in noradrenergic regions but only in a small number of dopaminergic neurons . DB03886 and dopamine contents , and TH activity in the striatum were poorly restored compared with those in the midbrain . TH-immunoreactivity in the lateral region of the striatum was far weaker than that in the medial region or in the nucleus accumbens . We concluded that dopaminergic nerve terminals projecting to the lateral region of the striatum are the most sensitive to BH4-insufficiency . Biochemical and pathological changes in DPS-rescued mice were similar to those in human malignant hyperphenylalaninemia and DRD .
