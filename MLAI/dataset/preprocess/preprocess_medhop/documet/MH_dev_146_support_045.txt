Multiplex protein signature for the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . PURPOSE : Accurate urine assays for bladder cancer detection would benefit patients and health care systems . Through extensive genomic and proteomic profiling of urine components we previously identified a panel of 8 biomarkers that can facilitate the detection of bladder cancer in voided urine samples . In this study we confirmed this diagnostic molecular signature in a diverse multicenter cohort . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We performed a case-control , phase II study in which we analyzed voided urine from 102 subjects with bladder cancer and 206 with varying urological disorders . The urinary concentration of 8 biomarkers ( P10145 , P14780 and 10 , P05121 , P15692 , P03950 , Q16790 and P02649 ) was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Diagnostic performance of the panel of tested biomarkers was evaluated using ROCs and descriptive statistical values , eg sensitivity and specificity . RESULTS : Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer . The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model , which had an AUROC of 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.84-0.93 ) , and 74 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity . In contrast , the sensitivity of voided urine cytology and the UroVysionÂ® cytogenetic test in this cohort was 39 % and 54 % , respectively . Study limitations include analysis performed on banked urine samples and the lack of voided urine cytology and cytogenetic test data on controls . CONCLUSIONS : The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays .
