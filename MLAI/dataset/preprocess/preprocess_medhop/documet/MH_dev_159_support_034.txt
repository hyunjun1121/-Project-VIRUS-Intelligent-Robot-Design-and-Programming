Cytokines and growth factors stimulate hyaluronan production : role of hyaluronan in epithelial to mesenchymal-like transition in non-small cell lung cancer . In this study , we investigated the role of hyaluronan ( HA ) in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) since close association between HA level and malignancy has been reported . HA is an abundant extracellular matrix component and its synthesis is regulated by growth factors and cytokines that include epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) . We showed that treatment with recombinant P01133 and IL-1beta , alone or in combination with TGF-beta , was able to stimulate HA production in lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 . TGF-beta/IL-1beta treatment induced epithelial to mesenchymal-like phenotype transition ( EMT ) , changing cell morphology and expression of vimentin and P12830 . We also overexpressed hyaluronan synthase-3 ( O00219 ) in epithelial lung adenocarcinoma cell line H358 , resulting in induced HA expression , EMT phenotype , enhanced P14780 and P08253 activities and increased invasion . Furthermore , adding exogenous HA to A549 cells and inducing HA H358 cells resulted in increased resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitor , DB00317 . Together , these results suggest that elevated HA production is able to induce EMT and increase resistance to DB00317 in NSCLC . Therefore , regulation of HA level in NSCLC may be a new target for therapeutic intervention .
