Differential sensitivity to cardiotonic drugs of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases isolated from canine ventricular and sinoatrial-enriched tissues . A cardiac phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) which specifically hydrolyzes DB02527 and is inhibited by cyclic GMP has been suggested to be the site of action of new cardiotonic drugs . To investigate the effect of inhibitors , canine cyclic nucleotide PDEs were isolated from left ventricle and from sinoatrial node-enriched tissue , using identical techniques . Four PDE forms could be chromatographically resolved from each tissue , including a peak I PDE ( calmodulin-activated phosphodiesterase , P62158 -PDE ) , a peak II PDE ( cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase , O00408 ) and a peak III PDE ( specific for cyclic AMP ) . The latter was further fractionated into two forms : One was inhibited by cyclic GMP and by the platelet antiaggregant AAL 05 ( CGI-PDE ) , and the second was insensitive to cyclic GMP and was inhibited by rolipram ( ROI-PDE ) . Reference PDE inhibitors , isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ( DB07954 ) and papaverine , nonselectively inhibited the four forms isolated from the two tissues . Cardiotonic drugs ( CI 930 , LY 181512 , piroximone , enoximone , and SK & F 94120 ) selectively inhibited CGI-PDE from ventricular tissue but were poorly active on both CGI-PDE and ROI-PDE from the sinoatrial-enriched fraction . In contrast , milrinone inhibited CGI-PDEs and ROI-PDEs from both ventricular and sinoatrial tissues . These results are in good agreement with pharmacologic data in the literature on the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of the studied drugs in the dog . They provide a possible basis for the dissociation of these two properties of PDE inhibitors .
