Inhibition by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 of activin A-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemic P12259 -5 cells . DB00136 ( 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 ) and other vitamin D3 ( VD3 ) analogs enhanced the inhibitory effect of Activin A on murine erythroleukemia ( P61006 ) cell proliferation and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner . 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited differentiation more potently than proliferation by one order of magnitude . The VD3 analog study demonstrated either effect of VD3 on P61006 cells via vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , as evidenced from the close relationship with the reported affinities for P11473 . The effects of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 were preceded by the suppression of ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) activity , a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine metabolism . Difluoromethylornithine ( DB06243 ) , an inhibitor of ODC , inhibited P61006 cell proliferation , which was reversed by the simultaneous addition of putrescine , a product of ODC , but did not affect differentiation . 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited cell differentiation during the phenotype-expression stage as reflected by the inhibition of beta-globin gene expression , while it inhibited proliferation in the commitment stage . Furthermore , it seems unlikely that the different effects of VD3 on proliferation and differentiation may be a result of upregulation of P11473 or nongenomic action . In summary , it was suggested that 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited Activin A-induced P61006 cell proliferation and differentiation by distinct mechanisms and inhibited the proliferation by inhibiting ODC activity . We demonstrated the presence of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 action on leukemic cells at physiological concentration , which was distinct from the pharmacological effect of VD3 reported thus far .
