P01308 -like growth factor-I:vitronectin complex-induced changes in gene expression effect breast cell survival and migration . Recent studies have demonstrated that P05019 associates with vitronectin ( VN ) through IGF-binding proteins ( IGFBP ) , which in turn modulate IGF-stimulated biological functions such as cell proliferation , attachment , and migration . Because IGFs play important roles in transformation and progression of breast tumors , we aimed to describe the effects of P05019 :IGFBP:VN complexes on breast cell function and to dissect mechanisms underlying these responses . In this study we demonstrate that substrate-bound P05019 :IGFBP:VN complexes are potent stimulators of MCF-7 breast cell survival , which is mediated by a transient activation of P29323 /MAPK and sustained activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathways . Furthermore , use of pharmacological inhibitors of the MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways confirms that both pathways are involved in P05019 :IGFBP:VN complex-mediated increased cell survival . Microarray analysis of cells stimulated to migrate in response to P05019 :IGFBP:VN complexes identified differential expression of genes with previously reported roles in migration , invasion , and survival ( P52799 , Sharp-2 , Tissue-factor , P31947 , P05121 , P35568 ) . These changes were not detected when the P05019 analogue ( [L(24)][A(31)]- P05019 ) , which fails to bind to the P08069 , was substituted ; confirming the P05019 -dependent differential expression of genes associated with enhanced cell migration . Taken together , these studies have established that P05019 :IGFBP:VN complexes enhance breast cell migration and survival , processes central to facilitating metastasis . This study highlights the interdependence of extracellular matrix and growth factor interactions in biological functions critical for metastasis and identifies potential novel therapeutic targets directed at preventing breast cancer progression .
