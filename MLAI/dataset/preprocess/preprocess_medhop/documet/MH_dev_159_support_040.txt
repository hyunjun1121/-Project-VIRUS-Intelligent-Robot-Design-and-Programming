DB01017 with aspirin : a therapeutic approach in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy . Enhanced production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) in diabetes leads to degradation of extracellular matrix in blood vessels and leads to complications of diabetes . In the present study , we have targeted P08253 and P14780 overactivation in diabetic neuropathy using a known P08253 and P14780 inhibitor , minocycline , with a non-selective P36551 inhibitor , aspirin . DB00428 -induced diabetic neuropathy was carried out in male Wistar rats and monitored by measuring the sensory nerve conduction velocity ( SNCV ) , motor nerve conduction velocity ( MNCV ) , tail flick latency and hot plate latency . Three weeks of treatment with a combination of minocycline and aspirin showed significant improvement in SNCV , MNCV , hot plate latency and tail flick latency when compared with diabetic control . The results of the present study suggest that P08253 and P14780 inhibition in the presence of P36551 inhibitor prevents the development of experimental diabetic neuropathy in rats and can be a potential approach for the treatment .
