Safety and efficacy of panitumumab following cetuximab : retrospective review of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering experience . There are two highly selective antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) now available for use in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . In P01116 wild type patients , cetuximab ( Cmab ) -an IgG1 chimeric molecule -- has activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy for the first , second and third-line settings . DB01269 ( Pmab ) -- a fully humanized IgG2 molecule -- has activity as a single agent in chemorefractory mCRC and shows promising activity in combination with chemotherapy . It remains unclear which antibody to use . This retrospective review of our experience with Pmab in 13 P00533 antibody-naive patients and in 22 patients previously treated with Cmab for mCRC highlights a lack of hypersensitivity reactions ( HSR ) with Pmab , even in patients who experienced HSR to Cmab . In patients who received Cmab , 22 % developed grade 3-4 HSR . There were no HSR on subsequent treatment with Pmab . We demonstrate similar activity in 95 % of cases , between Cmab and Pmab both alone and in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRC . In one case we report unique sensitivity to Pmab after progression with Cmab .
