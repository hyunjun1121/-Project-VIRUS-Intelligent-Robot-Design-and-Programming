DB01017 promotes dendritic spine maturation and improves behavioural performance in the fragile X mouse model . BACKGROUND : Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) is the most common single gene inherited form of mental retardation , with behaviours at the extreme of the autistic spectrum . Subjects with FXS and fragile X mental retardation gene knock out ( Fmr1 KO ) mice , an animal model for FXS , have been shown to exhibit defects in dendritic spine maturation that may underlie cognitive and behavioural abnormalities in FXS . DB01017 is a tetracycline analogue that has been used in clinical trials for stroke , multiple sclerosis and several neurodegenerative conditions . METHODS : We evaluated the effects of minocycline on dendritic spine development in the hippocampus of young Fmr1 KO mice , and in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons isolated from those mice . Cognitive effects of minocycline in young WT and Fmr1 KO mice were also evaluated using established behavioural tests for general cognition , activity and anxiety . RESULTS : Our studies demonstrate that minocycline promotes dendritic spine maturation both in cultures and in vivo . The beneficial effects of minocycline on dendritic spine morphology are also accompanied by changes in the behavioural performance of 3-week-old Fmr1 KO mice . DB01017 treated Fmr1 KO mice show less anxiety in the elevated plus maze and more strategic exploratory behaviour in the Y maze as compared to untreated Fmr1 KO mice . Our data suggest that these effects of minocycline may relate to its inhibitory action on P14780 expression and activity , which are higher in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice . CONCLUSION : These findings establish minocycline as a promising therapeutic for the treatment of fragile X mental retardation .
