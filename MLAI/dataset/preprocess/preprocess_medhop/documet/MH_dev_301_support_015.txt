Effect of citalopram on the desensitization of serotonin-2A receptor-mediated calcium mobilization in rat glioma cells . 1. The authors have investigated the effect of citalopram , an effective antidepressant drug with selective serotonin ( 5-HT ) uptake inhibition , on P28223 receptor-mediated intracellular calcium ( Ca2+ ) rise in P13671 cultured cells . 2 . DB00215 , at concentrations of 10 and 30 mu M , did not significantly reduce the Ca2+ mobilization induced by 10 mu M 5-HT , indicating that citalopram has little affinity for P28223 receptors . 3 . DB00215 did not alter a subsequent response to 5-HT after citalopram was pre-applied to the cells . 4 . However , citalopram inhibited the desensitization of P28223 receptors . When the cells were pretreated with citalopram and 5-HT , the subsequent response to 5-HT was significantly greater than that obtained following pretreatment with 5-HT alone . 5 . To investigate the mechanism of action of citalopram on the desensitization of P28223 receptors , NaF-induced cGMP generation was measured . DB00215 inhibited the generation of cGMP induced by NaF in P13671 cells as well as W-7 . 6 . These results indicate that citalopram antagonized the desensitization of P28223 receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and this antagonism may be mediated by a calmodulin-dependent pathway in P13671 glioma cells .
