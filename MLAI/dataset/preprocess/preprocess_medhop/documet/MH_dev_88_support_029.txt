P10912 blocker administration and muscle-tendon collagen synthesis in humans . CONTEXT : The growth hormone ( GH ) /insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) axis stimulates collagen synthesis in tendon and skeletal muscle , but no studies have investigated the effect of reducing P05019 on collagen synthesis in healthy humans . OBJECTIVE : We hypothesised , that a GH blockade would decrease P05019 and collagen synthesis in the connective tissue of skeletal muscle and tendon . DESIGN : The study was randomised and double blinded . PARTICIPANTS : 20 healthy young males completed the study . INTERVENTION : The participants were randomised to 2 weeks of P10912 blocker supplementation ( pegvisomant , 5 mg/day , n=9 ) or placebo ( n=11 ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum levels of GH , P05019 and P17936 ( P17936 ) were measured before and after pegvisomant/placebo supplementation . Fractional synthesis rates ( FSR ) for collagen and myofibrillar protein were determined with stable isotopes in tendon and muscle , and mRNA for collagen ( P02452 and P02461 ) as well as P05019 isoforms ( Ea and Ec ) were measured in skeletal muscle . RESULTS : DB00082 decreased serum P05019 by 20 % ( p < 0.01 ) and serum P17936 by 10 % ( p < 0.05 ) . DB00082 supplementation had no effect on collagen synthesis in tendon and skeletal muscle , nor was muscle myofibrillar protein synthesis affected . Similarly , pegvisomant supplementation had no effect on mRNA expression of P05019 and collagen in skeletal muscle . CONCLUSION : P10912 blocker administration in healthy humans resulted in a moderate decrease in serum P05019 . Collagen synthesis in tendon and skeletal muscle , as well as skeletal muscle P05019 and collagen mRNA expression , was unaffected by P10912 blocker supplementation .
