DB00501 induces interleukin-18 production through H2-agonist activity in monocytes . The present study demonstrates a possible mechanism for the improvement of gastrointestinal cancer patients ' prognosis by the histamine receptor type 2 ( P25021 ) antagonist cimetidine . This agent , but not the P25021 antagonists ranitidine and famotidine , induced the production of an antitumor cytokine , interleukin ( IL ) -18 , by human monocytes and dendritic cells ( DC ) . In fact , ranitidine and famotidine antagonized cimetidine-induced Q14116 production . DB00501 induced the activation of caspase-1 , which is reported to modify immature Q14116 to mature/active Q14116 , and the elevation of intracellular DB02527 , leading to the activation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) . The PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the Q14116 production induced by cimetidine . Moreover , the effects of cimetidine on Q14116 production were reproduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from wild-type mice , but not in those from P25021 knockout mice . In conclusion , cimetidine , a partial agonist for P25021 , has a pharmacological profile different from ranitidine and famotidine , possibly contributing to its antitumor activity on gastrointestinal cancers .
