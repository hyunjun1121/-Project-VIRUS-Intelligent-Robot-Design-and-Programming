Targeted deletion of ER chaperone P14625 in the liver results in injury , repopulation of P14625 -positive hepatocytes , and spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma development in aged mice . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) often results from chronic liver injury and severe fibrosis or cirrhosis , but the underlying molecular pathogenesis is unclear . We previously reported that deletion of glucose regulated protein 94 ( P14625 ) , a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone , in the bone marrow and liver leads to progenitor/stem cell expansion . Since liver progenitor cell ( Q16549 ) proliferation can contribute to liver tumor formation , here we examined the effect of P14625 deficiency on spontaneous liver tumorigenesis . Utilizing liver-specific Grp94 knockout mice driven by Albumin-Cre ( cGrp94(f/f) ) , we discovered that while wild-type livers are tumor free up to 24 months , cGrp94(f/f) livers showed abnormal small nodules at 15 months and developed HCC and ductular reactions ( DRs ) by 21 months of age , associating with increased liver injury , apoptosis and fibrosis . cGrp94(f/f) livers were progressively repopulated by P14625 -positive hepatocytes . At 15 months , we observed expansion of LPCs and mild DRs , as well as increase in cell proliferation . In examining the underlying mechanisms for HCC development in cGrp94(f/f) livers , we detected increase in TGF-Î²1 , activation of Q15796 /3 , P29323 , and JNK , and cyclin D1 upregulation at the premalignant stage . While epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was not evident , P12830 expression was elevated . Correlating with the recurrence of P14625 positive-hepatocytes , the HCC was found to be P14625 -positive , whereas the expanded LPCs and DRs remained P14625 -negative . Collectively , this study uncovers that P14625 deficiency in the liver led to injury , Q16549 expansion , increased proliferation , activation of oncogenic signaling , progressive repopulation of P14625 -positive hepatocytes and HCC development in aged mice .
