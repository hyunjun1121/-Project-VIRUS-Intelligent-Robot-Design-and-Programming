Transient estrogen exposure from birth affects uterine expression of developmental markers in neonatal gilts with lasting consequences in pregnant adults . Disruption of estrogen-sensitive , estrogen receptor ( ER ) -dependent events during porcine uterine development between birth ( postnatal day= P01160 0 ) and P01160 14 affects patterns of uterine morphoregulatory gene expression in the neonate with lasting consequences for reproductive success . Uterine capacity for conceptus support is reduced in pregnant adult gilts exposed to estradiol valerate ( EV ) for 14 days from birth . Objectives here were to determine effects of EV exposure from birth through P01160 13 on neonatal uterine and adult endometrial markers of growth , patterning , and remodeling . Targets included the relaxin receptor ( Q9HBX9 ) , estrogen receptor-alpha ( P03372 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , morphoregulatory markers P31260 and O00755 , and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)2 and P14780 . Gilts were treated daily with EV ( 50 microg/kg body weight per day , i.m. ) or corn oil vehicle from birth through P01160 13 . Uteri were obtained from neonates on P01160 14 and from adults on pregnancy day 12 ( PxD 12 ) . In neonates , EV exposure from birth increased uterine Q9HBX9 gene expression , and both P03372 and P15692 proteins . At PxD 12 , endometrial Q9HBX9 mRNA remained elevated , while P03372 protein was reduced . Early EV treatment decreased neonatal uterine O00755 , but increased P31260 expression . O00755 expression was reduced in EV-treated adults . Transient EV exposure increased P14780 transcripts at P01160 14 , whereas both latent and active P14780 activity was increased due to early EV treatment in adults on PxD 12 . Results support the hypothesis that transient , estrogen-induced disruption of porcine uterine development from birth alters early programming events that lead to functional consequences in the adult .
