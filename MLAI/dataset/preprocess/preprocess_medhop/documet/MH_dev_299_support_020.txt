Prolonged inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by atorvastatin inhibits apo B-100 and triglyceride secretion from HepG2 cells . DB01076 is a new P04035 inhibitor that strongly lowers plasma cholesterol and triglyceride ( TG ) levels in humans and animals . Since previous data indicated that atorvastatin has prolonged inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis , we tested whether this longer duration of inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis decreased hepatic lipoprotein secretion in vitro . We used the HepG2 hepatoma cell line to : ( 1 ) determine the time required until levels of secreted apo B-100 and TG declined significantly , ( 2 ) examine the relation to the mass of cellular cholesteryl ester ( CE ) and ( 3 ) test microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) activity which leads to decreased apo B-100 production . Although atorvastatin significantly inhibited cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 cells regardless of treatment duration ( 1 , 14 or 24 h ) , it did not inhibit TG synthesis . P04114 and TG secretion were unchanged after 1-h atorvastatin treatment , but declined significantly after 24-h treatment . DB01076 treatment also reduced cellular CE mass , exhibiting both time- and dose-dependency . Mevalonolactone , a product of P04035 , attenuated the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin . DB01076 strongly reduced mRNA levels of P55157 , whereas it did not inhibit P55157 activity as measured by TG transfer assay between liposomes . Simvastatin also induced treatment- and time-dependent reductions in apo B-100 , whereas the P55157 inhibitor BMS-201038 exhibited no time dependency , instead inhibiting this variable even on 1-h treatment . These results indicate that reduced apo B-100 secretion caused by atorvastatin is a secondary result owing to decreased lipid availability , and that atorvastatin 's efficacy depends on the duration of cholesterol synthesis inhibition in the liver .
