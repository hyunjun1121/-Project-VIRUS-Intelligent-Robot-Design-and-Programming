5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptor activation inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine1B-like receptor function via arachidonic acid metabolism . We previously reported that in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B-like ( CHO/ P28222 ) receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated DB02527 accumulation is inhibited by activation of transfected human P28335 receptors but not 5- Q13049 receptors . In the current study , we investigated the mechanism involved in the regulation of receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase as a means to further elucidate differences between the signal transduction cascades of the 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptor subtypes . Activation of P28335 receptors with 5-HT or (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane increased release of arachidonic acid via a phospholipase A2 ( P04054 ) -dependent mechanism . Incubation with (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ( 1 microM ) abolished 5-carboxamidotryptamine ( 5 nM ) -mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated DB02527 accumulation , which was blocked by the P04054 inhibitor mepacrine ( 100 microM ) and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin ( 2 microM ) . Furthermore , purinergic receptor-mediated P04054 activation as well as direct activation of P04054 with melittin reduced CHO/ P28222 responsiveness . These data indicate that activation of the P04054 /arachidonic acid signaling cascade mediates P28335 receptor regulation of the CHO/ P28222 receptor pathway . Consistent with our previous report and in contrast to activation of P28335 or purinergic receptors , activation of 5- Q13049 receptors had no effect on CHO/ P28222 receptor function , although 5- Q13049 receptor-mediated activation of P04054 was measured . Interestingly , purinergic receptor-mediated inhibition of CHO/ P28222 receptor function was blocked when 5- Q13049 receptors were activated simultaneously . These data suggest that the lack of 5- Q13049 mediated regulation of CHO/ P28222 receptors may be due to activation of a third pathway ( in addition to P98160 and P04054 pathways ) , which results in the inhibition of the production or the actions of a cyclooxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid metabolite .
