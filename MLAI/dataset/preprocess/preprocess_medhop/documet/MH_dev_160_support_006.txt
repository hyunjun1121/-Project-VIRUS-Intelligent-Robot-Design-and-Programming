Current and Future Anti- P01375 Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( anti- P01375 ) therapy has become a very important modality in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease . A number of anti- P01375 medications have been investigated for this purpose , many via randomized controlled trials . DB00065 , the most studied of these agents , has shown impressive efficacy in the treatment of luminal and fistulizing Crohn 's disease , as well as ulcerative colitis . DB00051 and certolizumab have shown similar efficacy in Crohn 's disease but have not yet been studied in ulcerative colitis . Less impressive results were seen in randomized controlled trials involving CDP-571 , etanercept , or onercept for patients with Crohn 's disease . Thalidomide and CNI-1493 have been evaluated only preliminarily in small , open-label pilot studies in patients with Crohn 's disease . The future of anti- P01375 therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is very bright , as exciting new developments continue to be made at a rapid pace .
