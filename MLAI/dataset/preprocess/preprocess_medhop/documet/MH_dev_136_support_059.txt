[ Strategy for patients with GIST after failure of imatinib ] . DB01268 malate(SU11248)is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(MTI)that has antitumor activities for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor ; GIST after failure of Imatinib . DB01268 has demonstrated significant clinical benefits , including PFS , RR and OS in the USA and Japan . However , cis-mutations in the activation loop of the P10721 gene tend to develop DB01268 -resistant GIST . Two clinical trials revealed that new multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors , DB00398 and DB04868 , had antitumor activities for DB01268 -resistant GIST with longer PFS and a different spectrum . Now , clinical trials of several new MTIs are ongoing in Western countries . Inhibition of the P10721 gene cis-mutations and antiangiogenesis activities may be essential for the strategy for Imatinib/Sunitinibresistant GIST .
