Regulation by nitric oxide of endotoxin-induced tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in endothelial cells . The increase in nitric oxide ( NO ) production in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced sepsis is thought to contribute to the development of shock . However , NO could also play an antithrombotic role . Little is known about the modulating effect of NO on the endothelial overexpression and production of tissue factor ( TF ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) occurring in endotoxemia . We analyzed the effect of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester ( L-NAME ) , an inhibitor of NO synthases , and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine ( P60880 ) , a NO donor , on the expression and synthesis of TF and P05121 by LPS-challenged human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) : L-NAME enhanced the increase in TF mRNA and antigen levels ( P < 0.05 ) observed in LPS-treated HUVEC ; P60880 down-regulated the LPS-induced TF increment ( p < 0.05 ) . However , no effects of NO on regulation of the LPS-dependent increase in P05121 could be seen . Thus , NO could play an antithrombotic role in sepsis by down-regulating the endothelial overexpression and production of TF .
