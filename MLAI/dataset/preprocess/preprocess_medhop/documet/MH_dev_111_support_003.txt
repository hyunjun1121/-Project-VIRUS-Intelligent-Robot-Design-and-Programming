Differential radiosensitisation by ZD1839 ( DB00317 ) , a highly selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in two related bladder cancer cell lines . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is expressed in a wide variety of epithelial tumours including carcinoma of the bladder . Stimulation of the P00533 pathway is blocked by ZD1839 ( DB00317 ) , a highly selective P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Radical radiotherapy is an established organ sparing treatment option for muscle invasive bladder cancer and this study has explored the possibility for the use of ZD1839 as a radiosensitiser in this scenario . The effect of combination treatment with ZD1839 ( 0.01 microM ) and ionising radiation in the established bladder cancer cell lines MGH-U1 and its radiosensitive mutant clone S40b was measured by clonogenic assays . A highly significant radiosensitising effect was seen in both cell lines ( P < 0.001 for MGH-U1 and S40b cell lines ) . This effect was independent of the concentration of the drug and the duration of exposure prior to treatment with ionising radiation . Cell cycle kinetics of both cell lines was not significantly altered with ZD1839 ( 0.01 microM ) as a single agent . A modest induction of apoptosis was observed with ZD1839 ( 0.01 microM ) as a single agent , but a marked induction was observed with the combination treatment of ZD1839 and ionising radiation . These results suggest a potentially important role for ZD1839 in combination with radiotherapy in the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer .
