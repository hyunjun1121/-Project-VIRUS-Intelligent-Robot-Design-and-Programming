Genomic organization , expression and evolution of porcine Q15648 , 2 , and 3 . Recently we identified and characterized porcine calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide ( CRSP ) 1 , O60244 and Q9ULK4 as members of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CT/ P80511 ) family . In the present study , the genomic sequences and organization of Q15648 , 2 , and 3 were determined , and the expression of the genes in the porcine brain was investigated using in situ hybridization . Analysis of 5'-upstream regions of the three CRSPs demonstrated that Q15648 and O60244 have almost identical sequences ( > 98 % similarity ) and high sequence similarities including functional transcription binding sites with the corresponding region of human CALCA ( CT/alpha P80511 ) , whereas Q9ULK4 retains less similarity with the above genes . RH mapping of CRSPs demonstrated that they resided in a region of swine chromosome 2 ( Q9NXB9 ) . The arrangement of the genes in the region was found to be conserved in corresponding human and mouse regions . In situ hybridization demonstrated sense transcripts of the three genes in cerebrum , hippocampus , hypothalamus , pons/midbrain , and thalamus of 3-month-old pigs , and O60244 sense transcripts additionally in tractus opticus . The sense transcripts of alpha P80511 and P10092 ( beta P80511 ) were detected in cerebrum , hippocampus , and pons/midbrain of newborn mice , and to a lesser extent in pons/midbrain of 8-week-old mice . These results taken together with the chromosomal conservation and phylogenetic clustering of CT/ P80511 family indicate that Q15648 , 2 , and 3 may be functionally different from alpha P80511 and beta P80511 , though they are indicated to have a common progenitor gene .
