DB00099 -induced stem cell mobilization in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients during imatinib therapy : safety , feasibility and evidence for an efficient in vivo purging . Therapy with imatinib mesylate is limited by cellular resistance in chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . Further , the limited availability of matching stem cell donors or an unfavourable risk profile for allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) reduces the number of therapeutic options in a number of patients . To assess the possibility of stem cell mobilization ( DB00919 ) during imatinib therapy we performed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim)-induced DB00919 and subsequent aphaeresis in 15 chronic phase and three accelerated phase CML patients . Aphaeresis was successful in 13 patients ( 72 % ) ( > or =2.0 x 10(6) P28906 + cells/kg body weight ) and five ( 28 % ) harvests could be obtained , which were negative for P11274 / P00519 mRNA as assessed by nested-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . All harvests , except one , were negative after first round RT-PCR , implicating a low level of CML cell contamination . There was no significant change in peripheral P11274 / P00519 transcript load after DB00919 as assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR . Fifteen patients remained stable in complete cytogenetic remission ( CCR ) during a median observation period of 9.3 months . One patient achieved a molecular remission shortly after DB00919 . Another patient who exhibited rising P11274 / P00519 mRNA levels before DB00919 achieved CCR after autologous P09683 with the generated harvest . One patient with a Philadelphia chromosome-negative , P11274 / P00519 -positive CML showed a cytogenetic relapse 6 months after DB00919 . We conclude that filgrastim-induced P28906 + cell aphaeresis under simultaneous imatinib medication is safe and feasible in CML patients . Additionally , we found evidence that this procedure could generate stem cell harvests that exhibit non-detectable levels of P11274 / P00519 mRNA .
