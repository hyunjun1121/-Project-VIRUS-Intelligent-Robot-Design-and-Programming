Role of serotonin in the regulation of interferon-gamma production by human natural killer cells . Monocytes , recovered directly from peripheral blood by counter-current centrifugal elutriation ( CCE ) , were shown to provide two regulatory signals for induction of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) in natural killer ( NK ) cells in response to interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) : an upregulating signal and an inhibitory signal . The inhibitory signal was time-dependent , irreversible , and operating on a pretranslational level , as indicated by the inability of enriched NK cells to accumulate P01579 mRNA in the presence of elutriated monocytes . Monocyte-induced inhibition of P01579 production was abrogated by the biogenic amine serotonin , acting via the 5-hydroxytryptamine , or serotonin ( P08908 ) , subset of serotonin receptors ( 5-HTR ) . Thereby , serotonin effectively promoted P01579 production in the presence of monocytes . We conclude that serotonergic P08908 receptors transduce signals that are required for NK cells to produce P01579 in response to P60568 .
