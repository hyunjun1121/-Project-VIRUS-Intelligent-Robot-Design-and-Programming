Serotonin induces the expression of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , or 5-HT ) , released from activated platelets , not only accelerates aggregation of platelets but also is known to promote mitosis , migration , and contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . These effects are considered to contribute to thrombus formation and atherosclerosis . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT on the expressions of coagulative and fibrinolytic factors in rat aortic endothelial cells . Endothelial cells were stimulated with various concentrations of 5-HT ( 0.1 approximately 10 microM ) , and the expressions of tissue factor ( TF ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( P10646 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( TPA ) messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) were evaluated by Northern blot analysis . The activities of TF and P05121 were also measured . TF and P05121 mRNA were increased significantly in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . However , P10646 and TPA mRNA expression did not change . The inductions of TF and P05121 mRNAs were inhibited by a 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist ( methiothepin ) and a selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ( D6RGH6 -9042 ) . These results indicate that 5-HT increases procoagulant activity and reduces fibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells through the 5- Q13049 receptor . It was concluded that the modulation of procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic activities of endothelial cells by 5-HT synergistically promotes thrombus formation at the site of vessel injury with the platelet aggregation , VSMC contraction , and VSMC proliferation .
