DB06186 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in extensive-disease-small-cell lung cancer : results from a randomized , double-blind , multicenter phase 2 trial . BACKGROUND : DB06186 , an anti- P16410 monoclonal antibody , demonstrated survival benefit in melanoma with immune-related ( ir ) adverse events ( irAEs ) managed by the protocol-defined guidelines . This phase 2 study evaluated ipilimumab+paclitaxel ( DB01229 ) /carboplatin in extensive-disease-small-cell lung cancer ( ED-SCLC ) . DESIGN : Patients ( n=130 ) with chemotherapy-na√Øve ED-SCLC were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2 ) /carboplatin ( area under the curve=6 ) with either placebo ( control ) or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg in two alternative regimens , concurrent ipilimumab ( ipilimumab+paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by placebo+paclitaxel/carboplatin ) or phased ipilimumab ( placebo+paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by ipilimumab+paclitaxel/carboplatin ) . Treatment was administered every 3 weeks for a maximum of 18 weeks ( induction ) , followed by maintenance ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks . End points included progression-free survival ( PFS ) , irPFS , best overall response rate ( BORR ) ; irBORR , overall survival ( OS ) , and safety . RESULTS : Phased ipilimumab , but not concurrent ipilimumab , improved irPFS versus control [ HR ( hazard ratio ) =0.64 ; P=0.03 ] . No improvement in PFS ( HR=0.93 ; P=0.37 ) or OS ( HR=0.75 ; P=0.13 ) occurred . Phased ipilimumab , concurrent ipilimumab and control , respectively , were associated with median irPFS of 6.4 , 5.7 and 5.3 months ; median PFS of 5.2 , 3.9 and 5.2 months ; median OS of 12.9 , 9.1 and 9.9 months . Overall rates of grade 3/4 irAEs were 17 , 21 and 9 % for phased ipilimumab , concurrent ipilimumab and control , respectively . CONCLUSION : These results suggest further investigation of ipilimumab in ED-SCLC .
