DB00065 use in patients with severe graft-versus-host disease and other emerging risk factors of non-Candida invasive fungal infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients : a cohort study . Acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . It has been proposed that tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) blockade with infliximab may be an effective treatment for severe ( grades III-IV ) GVHD . We determined if infliximab use in this high-risk population was associated with an additional increased risk of non-Candida invasive fungal infections ( IFIs ) . Records of the 2000-2001 HSCT cohort at our institution were reviewed . Fifty-three ( 20 % ) of 264 evaluable patients developed severe GVHD and 11 of these 53 ( 21 % ) received infliximab for treatment . Proven or probable IFI was documented in 10 ( 19 % ) of 53 patients with severe GVHD ( incidence rate of 0.99 cases/1000 GVHD patient-days ) . When stratified by infliximab use , 5 of 11 infliximab recipients developed an IFI ( 6.78 cases/1000 GVHD patient-days ) , compared with 5 of 42 IFI cases among nonrecipients ( 0.53 cases/1000 GVHD patient-days ) . In a time-dependent Cox regression model among patients with severe GVHD , the adjusted IFI hazard ratio of infliximab exposure was 13.6 ( P =.004 ; 95 % CI , 2.29-80.2 ) . We conclude that infliximab administration is associated with a significantly increased risk of non-Candida IFI in HSCT recipients with severe GVHD disease . Pre-emptive systemic antifungal therapy against molds should be considered in patients who develop severe GVHD after HSCT if infliximab is used .
