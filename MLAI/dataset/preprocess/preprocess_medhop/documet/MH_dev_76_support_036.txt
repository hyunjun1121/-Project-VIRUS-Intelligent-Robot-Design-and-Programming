Pharmacology of the calcium sensing receptor . DB01373 sensing receptor ( P41180 ) is a G-protein couple receptor which plays a key role in calcium homeostasis in vertebrates . Its extracellular domain is sensitive to divalent cations , aminoacids and polyamines . In parathyroid glands , P41180 activation causes parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) reduction and subsequently a decrease in blood calcium concentration . In PTH-dependent disorders , e.g. primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism ( Q9HD23 ) , the need for therapeutic options other than surgery led to the synthesis of various allosteric P41180 agonists ( calcimimetics ) , such as cinacalcet . DB01012 is the only calcimimetic approved for Q9HD23 secondary to chronic kidney disease ( CDK ) , parathyroid carcinoma , and , in some countries , primary Q9HD23 . Clinical trials showed that cinacalcet reduced PTH and calcemia both in CDK and primary Q9HD23 , lowering the risk of bone fractures , surgery , and cardiovascular complications in the former patients . Long-term safety and pharmacoeconomics have to be fully tested yet . Few both in vitro and in vivo studies showed an association between Arg990Gly- P41180 polymorphism and cinacalcet sensitivity , though in patients with severe P41180 inactivating mutations the drug substantially retained its positive clinical effects . Recently , a new class of allosteric antagonists of P41180 , i.e. calcilytics , has been synthesized . Calcilytics are structurally similar to calcimimetics , but exert their effects acting on a different allosteric site . Infusion of calcilytics was followed by transient rise in PTH and calcium . One of these compounds , DB05255 , was able to increase femur BMD in post menopausal women , but with induction of mild hyperparathyroidism . In the future , calcilytics may contribute to the osteoporosis treatment choice .
