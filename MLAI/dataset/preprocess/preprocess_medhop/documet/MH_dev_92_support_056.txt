Supplementation of Lactobacillus curvatus HY7601 and Lactobacillus plantarum KY1032 in diet-induced obese mice is associated with gut microbial changes and reduction in obesity . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the functional effects of probiotic treatment on the gut microbiota , as well as liver and adipose gene expression in diet-induced obese mice . DESIGN : Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet ( HFD ) for 8 weeks to induce obesity , and then randomized to receive HFD+probiotic ( Lactobacillus curvatus HY7601 and Lactobacillus plantarum KY1032 , n = 9 ) or HFD+placebo ( n = 9 ) for another 10 weeks . Normal diet ( ND ) fed mice ( n = 9 ) served as non-obese controls . RESULTS : Diet-induced obese mice treated with probiotics showed reduced body weight gain and fat accumulation as well as lowered plasma insulin , leptin , total-cholesterol and liver toxicity biomarkers . A total of 151,061 pyrosequencing reads for fecal microbiota were analyzed with a mean of 6,564 , 5,274 and 4,464 reads for the ND , HFD+placebo and HFD+probiotic groups , respectively . Gut microbiota species were shared among the experimental groups despite the different diets and treatments . The diversity of the gut microbiota and its composition were significantly altered in the diet-induced obese mice and after probiotic treatment . We observed concurrent transcriptional changes in adipose tissue and the liver . In adipose tissue , pro-inflammatory genes ( TNFα , P05231 , IL1β and MCP1 ) were down-regulated in mice receiving probiotic treatment . In the liver , fatty acid oxidation-related genes ( PGC1α , CPT1 , P23786 and Q15067 ) were up-regulated in mice receiving probiotic treatment . CONCLUSIONS : The gut microbiota of diet-induced obese mice appears to be modulated in mice receiving probiotic treatment . Probiotic treatment might reduce diet-induced obesity and modulate genes associated with metabolism and inflammation in the liver and adipose tissue .
