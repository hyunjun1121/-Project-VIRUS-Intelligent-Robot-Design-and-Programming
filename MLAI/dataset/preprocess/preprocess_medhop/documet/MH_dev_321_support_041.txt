The cholinergic system is involved in regulation of the development of the hematopoietic system . Gene expression profiling demonstrated that components of the cholinergic system , including choline acetyltransferase , acetylcholinesterase and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) , are expressed in embryonic stem cells and differentiating embryoid bodies ( EBs ) . Triggering of nAChRs expressed in EBs by nicotine resulted in activation of MAPK and shifts of spontaneous differentiation toward hemangioblast . In vivo , non-neural nAChRs are detected early during development in fetal sites of hematopoiesis . Similarly , in vivo exposure of the developing embryo to nicotine resulted in higher numbers of hematopoietic progenitors in fetal liver . However postpartum , the number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ( O14818 ) was decreased , suggesting an impaired colonization of the fetal bone marrow with HSPCs . This correlated with increased number of circulating O14818 and decreased expression of P61073 that mediates migration of circulating cells into the bone marrow regulatory niche . In addition , protein microarrays demonstrated that nicotine changed the profile of cytokines produced in the niche . While the levels of IL1alpha , IL1beta , P60568 , P15248 and P22301 were not changed , the production of hematopoiesis-supportive cytokines including DB00099 , GM- P04141 , P08700 , P05231 and P17936 was decreased . This correlated with the decreased repopulating ability of O14818 in vivo and diminished hematopoietic activity in bone marrow cultures treated with nicotine . Interestingly , nicotine stimulated the production of P05112 and P05113 , implying a possible role of the cholinergic system in pathogenesis of allergic diseases . Our data provide evidence that the nicotine-induced imbalance of the cholinergic system during gestation interferes with normal development and provides the basis for negative health outcomes postpartum in active and passive smokers .
