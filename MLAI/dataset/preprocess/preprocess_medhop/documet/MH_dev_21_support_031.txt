DB00013 binds to a plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2-like molecule in placental microvillous membranes . Placental microvillous membranes exhibited saturable binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator with plateau achieved by 30 min at 4 degrees C and 10 min at 37 degrees C . The binding was essentially irreversible . The capacity was about 8 pmol urokinase per mg membrane protein . Half-maximal displacement of 125I-labelled urokinase was achieved with about 1.0 nM unlabelled urokinase when using 75 micrograms membrane protein/ml . 125I-labelled urokinase did not bind when treated with diisopropylfluorophosphate to block the catalytic activity . Single-chain urokinase ( prourokinase ) , devoid of catalytic activity , did not bind . Catalytically active tissue-type plasminogen activator did compete with 125I-labelled urokinase for binding although less efficiently than urokinase . Binding activity remained in the 100,000 x g pellet after treatment of the membranes with 3 M DB00761 , alkaline stripping at pH 12 or extraction by the detergent Triton X-100 . The binding was essentially blocked by antibodies against plasminogen activator inhibitor-type-2 ( P05120 ) . DB00815 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized membranes with bound 125I-labelled urokinase showed that the urokinase- P05120 complexes largely migrated in fractions corresponding to a very large Mr although no clearly defined peaks were observed . It is suggested that P05120 occurs in a form anchored to syncytiotrophoblast microvilli , possibly to the cytoskeleton .
