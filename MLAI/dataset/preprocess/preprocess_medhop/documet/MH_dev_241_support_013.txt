DB02546 , an HDAC inhibitor attenuates epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma growth by dampening P42345 signaling pathway in a human xenograft murine model . Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors are potent anticancer agents and show efficacy against various human neoplasms . DB02546 is a potent HDAC inhibitor and has shown potential to inhibit growth of human xenograft tumors . However , its effect on the growth of skin neoplasm remains undefined . In this study , we show that vorinostat ( 2 Î¼M ) reduced expression of Q13547 , 2 , 3 , and 7 in epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells . Consistently , it increased acetylation of histone H3 and p53 . DB02546 ( 100mg/kg body weight , IP ) treatment reduced human xenograft tumor growth in highly immunosuppressed nu/nu mice . Histologically , the vorinostat-treated tumor showed features of well-differentiation with large necrotic areas . Based on proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) staining and expression of cyclins D1 , D2 , E , and A , vorinostat seems to impair proliferation by down-regulating the expression of these proteins . However , it also induced apoptosis . The mechanism by which vorinostat blocks proliferation and makes tumor cells prone to apoptosis , involved inhibition of P42345 signaling which was accompanied by reduction in cell survival AKT and extracellular-signal regulated kinase ( P29323 ) signaling pathways . Our data provide a novel mechanism-based therapeutic intervention for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . DB02546 may be utilized to cure skin neoplasms in organ transplant recipient ( OTR ) . These patients have high morbidity and surgical removal of these lesions which frequently develop in these patients , is difficult .
