P10275 mediates non-genomic activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase in androgen-sensitive epithelial cells . Androgens are known to modulate many cellular processes such as cell growth and survival by binding to the androgen receptor ( AR ) and activating the transcription of target genes . Recent data suggested that AR can also mediate non-transcriptional actions outside the nucleus in addition to its ligand-inducible transcription factor function . Here , we describe a transcription-independent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase ( P19957 -K ) signaling pathway by androgens . Using non-transformed androgen-sensitive epithelial cells , we show that androgens enhance the P19957 -K activity by promoting accumulation of phosphoinositide-3-P phospholipids in vitro . This activation is found in conjunction with an increased time-dependent phosphorylation of the downstream kinase AKT/protein kinase B on both DB00133 (473) and DB00156 (308) residues . Hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT requires AR since incubation with the anti-androgen bicalutamide completely abolishes the androgen-stimulated AKT phosphorylation . Accordingly , we show that androgens increase AKT phosphorylation level in prostatic carcinoma PC3 cells only once they have been transfected with AR . Downstream , androgens enhance phosphorylation of transcription factor Q12778 ( Q12778 ) - Q9NUQ9 and proapoptotic Bad protein and promote cell survival as they can counteract an apoptotic process . We also report that non-genomic effects of androgens are based on direct interaction between AR and the p85alpha regulatory subunit of class I(A) P19957 -K . Together , these novel findings point out an important and physiologically relevant link between androgens and the P19957 -K/AKT signaling pathway in governing cell survival .
