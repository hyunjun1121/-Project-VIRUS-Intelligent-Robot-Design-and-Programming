Profile of cabozantinib and its potential in the treatment of advanced medullary thyroid cancer . Medullary thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignancy for which until recently little effective treatment existed . It is often characterized by mutation and overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinases P07949 ( rearranged during transfection ) , P35968 ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ) and MET ( mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor ) , which make attractive targets for drug development . DB08875 is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor which blocks MET , VEGRF2 and P07949 , and has shown considerable activity in medullary thyroid cancer in a Phase III trial , including in heavily pretreated patients . Its novel combination of vascular endothelial growth factor and MET inhibition is believed to address the MET escape pathway , which is thought to be the cause of nonsustained tumor responses resulting from inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor alone .
