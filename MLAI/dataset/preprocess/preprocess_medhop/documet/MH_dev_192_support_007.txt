N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids regulate lipid metabolism through several inflammation mediators : mechanisms and implications for obesity prevention . Obesity is a growing problem that threatens the health and welfare of a large proportion of the human population . The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) are dietary factors that have potential to facilitate reduction in body fat deposition and improve obesity-induced metabolic syndromes . The n-3 PUFA up-regulate several inflammation molecules including serum amyloid A ( P0DJI8 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) in hepatocytes and adipocytes . Actions of these inflammation mediators resemble those of n-3 PUFA in the modulation of many lipid metabolism-related genes . For instance , they both suppress expressions of perilipin , sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 ( P36956 ) and lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) to induce lipolysis and reduce lipogenesis . This review will connect these direct or indirect regulating pathways between n-3 PUFA , inflammation mediators , lipid metabolism-related genes and body fat reduction . A thorough knowledge of these regulatory mechanisms will lead us to better utilization of n-3 PUFA to reduce lipid deposition in the liver and other tissues , therefore presenting an opportunity for developing new strategies to treat obesity .
