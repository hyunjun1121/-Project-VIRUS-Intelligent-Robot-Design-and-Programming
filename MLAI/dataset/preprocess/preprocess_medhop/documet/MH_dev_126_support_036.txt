Epithelial growth factor receptor interacting agents . The data reviewed here have further established the promise of anti- P00533 -targeted therapies . This statement is supported by the evidence of antitumor activity of the TK inhibitors ZD1839 and DB00530 against several tumor types and by the ability of the monoclonal antibody IMC-C225 to reverse clinical chemotherapy resistance . These results are further supported by an emerging number of compounds , monoclonal antibodies , and TK inhibitors directed at the P00533 that are in clinical development ( see Fig. 2 , Table 1 ) . Among the TK inhibitors , these compounds can be further categorized by their receptor specificity and reversibility of binding . In the case of anti- P00533 monoclonal antibodies , compounds in clinical development include chimeric , humanized , and bispecific antibodies . The fundamental observation is that these compounds have shown activity in several tumor types , including NSCL cancer , prostate carcinoma , colorectal carcinoma , ovarian carcinoma , renal cell carcinoma , and head and neck cancers . These findings observed with different agents and in different tumor types validate P00533 as a target for cancer therapy . The results of ongoing studies with these agents in diverse indications and tumor types may establish the role of these promising therapies to our current cancer treatments .
