PP2Cdelta ( Ppm1d , O15297 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of p38 MAPK , is regulated along with Trp53 and Cdkn2a following p38 MAPK inhibition during mouse preimplantation development . Preimplantation embryos utilize mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling ( MAPK ) pathways to relay signals from the external environment to prepare appropriate responses and adaptations to a changing milieu . It is therefore important to investigate how MAPK pathways are regulated during preimplantation development . This study was conducted to investigate whether PP2Cdelta ( Ppm1d , O15297 ) is expressed during mouse preimplantation development and to determine the influences of p38 MAPK inhibition on expression of Trp53 ( p53 ) , Ppm1d , ( O15297 ) , and Cdkn2a ( p16 ) during mouse preimplantation development . Our results indicate that Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a mRNAs and TRP53 and PP2Cdelta proteins are expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development . Treatment of 2-cell embryos with DB04338 ( potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK alpha/beta/ Q16539 /11 ) significantly increased Trp53 , Ppm1d and Cdkn2a and Mapk14 mRNA levels at 12 and 24 hr . Treatment of 8-cell embryos with DB04338 for 12 hr increased Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a mRNA levels , but not Mapk14 mRNA levels . Treatment of 8-cell embryos for 24 hr increased Trp53 , and Ppm1d mRNA levels , but decreased Cdkn2a and Mapk14 mRNA levels . Therefore , blockade of p38 MAPK activity is associated with embryo stage specific influences on Trp53 , Ppm1d , Cdkn2a , and Mapk14 expression during mouse preimplantation development . These results define downstream targets of p38 MAPK during preimplantation development and indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway regulates Trp53 , Ppm1d , and Cdkn2a expression . This study increases our understanding of the mechanisms controlling preimplantation development and of the interactions between preimplantation embryos and their culture environments .
