DB00398 in melanoma . INTRODUCTION : DB00398 is an orally available multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits tumor proliferation by targeting multiple kinases including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors P17948 , P35968 , P35916 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor P09619 , and it targets tumor progression by inhibiting P36888 , C-Kit and P15056 . Since P15056 mutations are frequent in melanoma , sorafenib was investigated in various Phase I , II and III clinical trials . The drug is well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse effects , which are mostly limited to cutaneous toxicity , diarrhea and fatigue . AREAS COVERED : Systematic literature review of the randomized trials using PubMed was performed . Original articles were reviewed and citations from those were also considered . Additionally , clinical trial databases were examined to identify and summarize ongoing trials of sorafenib in melanoma patients . EXPERT OPINION : DB00398 as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy is of limited use . Combining it with dacarbazine doubled the response rate and the progression-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients . Unfortunately , these results have never been evaluated in large randomized Phase III clinical trials . According to the trials conducted so far a subpopulation of patients experience substantial benefit , therefore it is essential to identify biomarkers to select the subgroups of patients that are more likely to respond to sorafenib . Furthermore , other less frequent subtypes such as mucosal or ocular melanoma still constitute promising targets ; academic institutions are currently launching investigator-initiated trials in these indications .
