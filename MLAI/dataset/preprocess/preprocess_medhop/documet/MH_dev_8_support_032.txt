Growth factors and their receptors : new targets for prostate cancer therapy . Stimulation of the signal transduction pathway of the epidermal growth-factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase family of receptors in tumor cells enhances cellular proliferation , prevents apoptosis , and promotes tumor-cell mobility , adhesion , and invasion . Therapeutic approaches used to target the P00533 and its signal transduction cascade include ( 1 ) monoclonal antibodies ( eg , cetuximab [ IMC-C225 ] ) directed against the extracellular binding domain of the receptor ; and ( 2 ) trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody binding to the P04626 receptor ; immunotoxin conjugates use an antibody directed against P00533 joined to a cell toxin . All are in clinical trials for a number of cancers , including prostate cancer . Antisense strategies are in preclinical development . Low-molecular-weight inhibitors of the P00533 tyrosine kinase also in clinical development include DB00530 , PD182905 , PKI-166 , DB05424 , and ZD1839 . ZD1839 has shown encouraging results in patients with prostate cancer in phase 1 trials. mn
