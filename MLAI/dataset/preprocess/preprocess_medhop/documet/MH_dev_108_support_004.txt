Current therapies in rheumatoid arthritis : a Latin American perspective . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a systemic inflammatory disease affecting the synovium of joints , tendons , and some extra-articular sites . RA prevalence in Latin America ranges from 0.4 to 1.6 % . Early treatment of RA translates into a substantial reduction in the cost to society . In light of this , early disease clinics are being established in some countries . Barriers to RA management , such as delay in referral to rheumatologists and limited access to therapy , have been identified . Evidence-based treatment guidelines have been adapted by countries according to their own situations . The need for keeping accurate records of biologics prescribed has been addressed by biologic registries , thereby contributing toward a better understanding of rheumatic diseases and their treatment . Current biologics include the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α inhibitors ( etanercept , infliximab , and adalimumab ) , B-cell depletion agent ( rituximab ) , interleukin-6 receptor blocker ( tocilizumab ) , and T-cell co-stimulatory blocker ( abatacept ) . Future therapies include kinase inhibitors ( tofacitinib and fostamatinib ) , alternative P01375 -α inhibitors ( DB06674 and certolizumab ) , and biosimilars .
