Small molecular anti-cytokine agents . The recent successful introduction of the anti-cytokine biologicals DB00005 , DB00065 , DB00051 , and DB00026 has stimulated the search for anti-cytokine small-molecules . A number of molecular targets have been identified for the development of such small molecular anti-cytokine agents . The focus of this review will be on those inhibitors of cytokine production , which target either p38 mitogen activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase , P01375 converting enzyme ( P78536 ) , or IL-1beta converting enzyme ( ICE ) . O75791 Q96HU1 kinase occupies a central role in the signaling network responsible for the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1beta ( IL-1beta ) and P01375 , and regulates their biosynthesis at both the transcriptional and translational level . P78536 and ICE are two proteases required for the processing of proTNF-alpha and proIL-1beta , respectively into their mature , proinflammatory form . Since the mid-1990s , a plethora of inhibitors of p38 Q96HU1 kinase , P78536 , and ICE has been characterized in vitro , and individual representatives from all three inhibitor classes have in the meantime been advanced into clinical trials . This review will highlight the correlation between effective inhibition at the molecular target and cellular activity in functional assays of cytokine , particularly P01375 and IL-1beta , production . Structure-activity relationships ( SAR ) will be discussed regarding activity at the respective enzyme target , but also with regard to properties required for efficient in vitro and in vivo cellular activity ( e.g. , oral availability , solubility , cell penetration , etc. ) .
