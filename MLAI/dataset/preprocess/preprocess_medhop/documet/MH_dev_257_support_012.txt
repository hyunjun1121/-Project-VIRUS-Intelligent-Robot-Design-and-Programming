Membranous glomerulonephritis with the use of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis . OBJECTIVE : To report a case of membranous glomerulonephritis with the use of etanercept in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis . CASE SUMMARY : A 60-year-old female with severe ankylosing spondylitis and no history of renal disease was started on etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously once a week after standard treatment modalities failed . She had not been on any nephrotoxic drugs , including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs , for over 1 year . After 2 months of etanercept therapy , the patient presented with anasarca , proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , and normal serum creatinine . Renal biopsy showed features classic for membranous glomerulonephritis ( MGN ) . DB00005 was discontinued , with resolution of anasarca and proteinuria over the following 3 months . DISCUSSION : Very few cases of MGN in patients with ankylosing spondylitis have been reported in the literature ; additionally , MGN following etanercept therapy has not been described in patients with ankylosing spondylitis so far . The exact pathogenesis of etanercept-induced MGN in ankylosing spondylitis is not known . P01375 -Î± antagonists have been associated with the formation of autoantibodies and induction of lupus-like ailments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . It is possible that a similar dysregulation of the immune system might have accounted for the development of MGN in this patient . The Naranjo probability scale showed that this patient 's MGN was probably associated with etanercept therapy . CONCLUSIONS : In addition to the well-described serious adverse drug events , including serious infections , the use of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis can be associated with the development of MGN . Health care providers , especially rheumatologists , should be aware of this potentially serious adverse drug reaction .
