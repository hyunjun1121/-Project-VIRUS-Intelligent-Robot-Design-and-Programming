Inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase attenuates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo . P14324 ( FPPS ) , as a key branchpoint of the mevalonate pathway , catalyzes the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates . The isoprenoid intermediates are needed for protein isoprenylation to participate in cardiac remodeling . We have previously demonstrated that both knockdown of FPPS with small interfering RNA and inhibition of FPPS by alendronate could prevent Ang II-induced hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes . In this study , we evaluated the effects of FPPS inhibition in Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo . Wild type mice were separately treated with saline , Ang II ( 2.88 mg/kg per day ) , FPPS inhibitor alendronate ( 0.1 mg/kg per day ) , or the combination of Ang II ( 2.88 mg/kg per day ) and alendronate ( 0.1 mg/kg per day ) for 4 weeks . The results showed that Ang II increased FPPS expression , and the increases of Ang II-induced synthesis of the isoprenoid intermediates , FPP and GGPP , were significantly inhibited by FPPS inhibitor . In the meantime , FPPS inhibition attenuated Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as indexed by the heart weight to body weight ratio , echocardiographic parameters , histological examinations and expression of P01160 and DB04899 mRNA . Furthermore , it was also found that FPPS inhibitor attenuated Ang II-induced increases of RhoA activity and p-38 MAPK phosphorylation and TGF-β1 mRNA expression . In conclusion , FPPS might play an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in vivo , at least in part through RhoA , p-38 MAPK and TGF-β1 .
