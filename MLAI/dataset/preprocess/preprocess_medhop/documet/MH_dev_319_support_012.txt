LiCABEDS II . Modeling of ligand selectivity for G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors . The cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 ( CB2 ) is a promising therapeutic target for blood cancer , pain relief , osteoporosis , and immune system disease . The recent withdrawal of DB06155 , which targets another closely related cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) , accentuates the importance of selectivity for the development of CB2 ligands in order to minimize their effects on the P21554 receptor . In our previous study , LiCABEDS ( Ligand Classifier of Adaptively Boosting Ensemble Decision Stumps ) was reported as a generic ligand classification algorithm for the prediction of categorical molecular properties . Here , we report extension of the application of LiCABEDS to the modeling of cannabinoid ligand selectivity with molecular fingerprints as descriptors . The performance of LiCABEDS was systematically compared with another popular classification algorithm , support vector machine ( SVM ) , according to prediction precision and recall rate . In addition , the examination of LiCABEDS models revealed the difference in structure diversity of P21554 and CB2 selective ligands . The structure determination from data mining could be useful for the design of novel cannabinoid lead compounds . More importantly , the potential of LiCABEDS was demonstrated through successful identification of newly synthesized CB2 selective compounds .
