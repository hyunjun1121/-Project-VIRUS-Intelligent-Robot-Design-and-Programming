Novel positron emission tomography tracer distinguishes normal from cancerous cells . Development of tumor-specific probes for imaging by positron emission tomography has broad implications in clinical oncology , such as diagnosis , staging , and monitoring therapeutic responses in patients , as well as in biomedical research . P04818 ( P04818 ) -based de novo biosynthesis of DNA is an important target for drug development . Increased DNA replication in proliferating cancerous cells requires P04818 activity , which catalyzes the reductive methylation of DB03800 to dTMP using ( R ) -N(5),N(10)-methylene- DB00116 ( MTHF ) as a cofactor . In principle , radiolabeled MTHF can be used as a substrate for this reaction to identify rapidly dividing cells . In this proof-of-principle study , actively growing ( log phase ) breast cancer ( MCF7 , MDA-MB-231 , and hTERT- P31947 ) , normal breast ( human mammary epithelial and MCF10A ) , colon cancer ( HT-29 ) , and normal colon ( FHC ) cells were incubated with [(14)C]MTHF in culture medium from 30 min to 2 h , and uptake of radiotracer was measured . Cancerous cell lines incorporated significantly more radioactivity than their normal counterparts . The uptake of radioactively labeled MTHF depended upon a combination of cell doubling time , folate receptor status , S phase percentage , and P04818 expression in the cells . These findings suggest that the recently synthesized [(11)C]MTHF may serve as a new positron emission tomography tracer for cancer imaging .
