[ Level of neuropeptide Y in serum of patients with chronic congestive heart failure ] . The purpose of the study was to measure plasma concentrations of neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , endothelin-1,2 ( ET-1,2 ) , alpha atrial natriuretic polypeptide ( P01160 ) and noradrenaline ( NA ) in relation to cardiac index ( CI ) and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) in patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . There were significant increases in venous blood concentrations of P01303 , Na , ET-1,2 , P01160 in the patients with CHF . Plasma concentrations of P01303 correlated with plasma NA concentrations but plasma noradrenaline concentrations alone correlated with CI and LVEF . In patients with CHF plasma NA concentrations seems to be more sensitive index of cardiac dysfunction then the concentrations of neuropeptide Y .
