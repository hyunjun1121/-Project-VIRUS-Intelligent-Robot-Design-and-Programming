The effects of a cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression and inhibition on human uveal melanoma cell proliferation and macrophage nitric oxide production . BACKGROUND : P35354 ( P35354 ) expression has previously been identified in uveal melanoma although the biological role of P35354 in this intraocular malignancy has not been elucidated . This study aimed to investigate the effect of a P35354 inhibitor on the proliferation rate of human uveal melanoma cells , as well as its effect on the cytotoxic response of macrophages . METHODS : Human uveal melanoma cell lines were transfected to constitutively express P35354 and the proliferative rate of these cells using two different methods , with and without the addition of Amfenac , was measured . DB00435 production by macrophages was measured after exposure to melanoma-conditioned medium from both groups of cells as well as with and without Amfenac , the active metabolite of DB06802 . RESULTS : Cells transfected to express P35354 had a higher proliferation rate than those that did not . The addition of Amfenac significantly decreased the proliferation rate of all cell lines . DB00435 production by macrophages was inhibited by the addition of melanoma conditioned medium , the addition of Amfenac partially overcame this inhibition . CONCLUSION : Amfenac affected both P35354 transfected and non-transfected uveal melanoma cells in terms of their proliferation rates as well as their suppressive effects on macrophage cytotoxic activity .
