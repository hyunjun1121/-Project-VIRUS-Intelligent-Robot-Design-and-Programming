Identification of candidate genes and mutations in QTL regions for immune responses in chicken . There are two categories of immune responses - innate and adaptive immunity - both having polygenic backgrounds and a significant environmental component . In our study , adaptive immunity was represented by the specific antibody response toward DB05299 ( KLH ) ; innate immunity was represented by natural antibodies toward lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) . Defining genetic bases of immune responses leads from defining quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) toward a single mutation responsible for variation in the phenotypic trait . The goal of the reported study was to define candidate genes and mutations for the immune traits of interest in chicken by performing an association study of SNPs located in candidate genes defined in QTL regions . Candidate genes and SNPs in QTL regions were selected in silico . SNP association was based on a custom SNP panel , GoldenGate genotyping assay ( Illumina ) and two statistical models : random mixed model and CAR score . The most significant SNP for immune response toward KLH was located in the Q6NYC1 gene located on GGA18 . Four SNPs in candidate genes Q92949 ( GGA18 ) , P54762 ( GGA9 ) , P35408 ( GGAZ ) and P05771 ( GGA14 ) showed association with natural antibodies for LPS . A single SNP in P16144 ( GGA18 ) was associated with natural antibodies for P01374 . All associated SNPs mentioned above showed additive effects .
