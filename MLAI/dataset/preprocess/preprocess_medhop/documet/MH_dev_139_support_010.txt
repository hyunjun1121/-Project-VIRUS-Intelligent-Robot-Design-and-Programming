Retinoids induce P14780 expression through RARalpha during mammary gland remodeling . Retinoic acid ( RA ) is a signaling molecule in the morphogenesis of the mammary gland , modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . The aim of this paper was to study the role of RA during weaning , which consists of three events : apoptosis of the secretory cells , degradation of the extracellular matrix , and adipogenesis . CRABP II and P09455 -1 carrier proteins increased significantly during weaning compared with lactating glands but reverted to control values after the litter resuckled . The effects of RA are mediated by the nuclear receptors RARalpha , RARbeta , RARgamma , and RXRalpha , which underwent an increase in protein levels during weaning . In an attempt to elucidate the RARalpha-dependent signaling pathway , ChIP assays were performed . The results showed the binding of RARalpha to the P14780 promoter after 24- and 72-h weaning together with its coactivator p300 ; this fact could be responsible for the increase found in P14780 mRNA and protein levels in these conditions . Expression of related MMPs ( P08253 and P08254 ) was also increased during weaning . Using gelatine zymography , we observed a time-dependent increase in active forms of P14780 and P08253 . On the other hand , the inhibitor of MMPs , P01033 , was almost undetectable at 24- and 72-h weaning by Western blot . The role of retinoids in matrix remodeling is reinforced by the fact that administration of an acute dose of retinol palmitate to control lactating rats also induces P14780 expression . This emphasizes the importance of retinoids in vivo to regulate mammary gland involution .
