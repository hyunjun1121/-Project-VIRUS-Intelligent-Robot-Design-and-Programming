Role of histone deacetylation in cell-specific expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase . Histone acetylation plays an important role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression . The molecular mechanisms involved in cell-specific expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( P29474 ) are not fully understood . In this study we investigated whether histone deacetylation was involved in repression of P29474 expression in non-endothelial cells . Induction of P29474 expression by histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors trichostatin A ( P32119 ) and sodium butyrate was observed in all four different types of non-endothelial cells examined . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the induction of P29474 expression by P32119 was accompanied by a remarkable increase of acetylation of histone H3 associated with the P29474 5'-flanking region in the non-endothelial cells . Moreover , DNA methylation-mediated repression of P29474 promoter activity was partially reversed by P32119 treatment , and combined treatment of P32119 and DB01262 ( AzadC ) synergistically induced P29474 expression in non-endothelial cells . The proximal Sp1 site is critical for basal activity of P29474 promoter . The induction of P29474 by inhibition of HDACs in non-endothelial cells , however , appeared not mediated by the changes in Sp1 DNA binding activity . We further showed that Sp1 bound to the endogenous P29474 promoter and associated with Q13547 in non-endothelial HeLa cells . Combined P32119 and AzadC treatment increased Sp1 binding to the endogenous P29474 promoter but decreased the association between Q13547 and Sp1 in HeLa cells . Our data suggest that Q13547 plays a critical role in P29474 repression , and the proximal Sp1 site may serve a key target for HDCA1-mediated P29474 repression in non-endothelial cells .
