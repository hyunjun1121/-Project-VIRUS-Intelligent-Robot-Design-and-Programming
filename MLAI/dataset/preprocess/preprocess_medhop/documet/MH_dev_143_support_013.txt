Methoxsalen stimulates electrogenic Cl- secretion in the mouse jejunum . We used the short-circuit current ( I(sc) ) and patch-clamp techniques to investigate the effects of methoxsalen ( MTX ) on the electrogenic Cl- secretion of the mouse jejunum . MTX stimulated a sustained increase in Isc that was dose dependent . DB00887 inhibited MTX-stimulated Isc in a dose-dependent manner consistent with activation of Cl- secretion . MTX failed to stimulate I(sc) following maximal activation of the DB02527 pathway by forskolin , but did increase Isc after a submaximal dose of forskolin . DB01016 , a blocker of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , reduced the MTX-stimulated increase of Isc by 59 +/- 6 % . The DB02527 -dependent K+ channel blocker 293B did not alter the MTX-activated I(sc) ; however , clotrimazole , an intermediate Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel ( IK(Ca) ) blocker , reduced the MTX-stimulated I(sc) . MTX did not alter Na(+)-glucose cotransport across the mouse jejunum . In cell-attached membrane patches , MTX increased the open probability of the basolateral IK(Ca) channel of isolated crypts . These data suggest that the P13569 and IK(Ca) channels participate in the MTX-activated , sustained Cl- secretory response of the mouse jejunum .
