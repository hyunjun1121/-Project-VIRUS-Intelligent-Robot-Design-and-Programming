Plasmid DNA adsorbed onto cationic microparticles mediates target gene expression and antigen presentation by dendritic cells . Dendritic cells ( DC ) play a key role in antigen presentation and activation of specific immunity . Much current research focuses on harnessing the potency of DC for vaccines , gene therapy , and cancer immunotherapy applications . However , DC are not readily transfected in vitro by traditional nonviral techniques . A novel DNA vaccine formulation was used to determine if DC are transfected in vitro . The formulation consists of plasmid DNA adsorbed on to cationic microparticles composed of the biodegradable polymer polylactide-co-glycolide ( P00747 ) and the cationic surfactant , cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB ) . Using preparations of fluorescent-labeled plasmid DNA formulated on P00747 -CTAB microparticles to study internalization by macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo , we found that most , but not all , of the fluorescence was concentrated in endosomal compartments . Furthermore , uptake of plasmid DNA encoding HIV p55 gag adsorbed to P00747 -CTAB microparticles by murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells resulted in target gene expression , as detected by RT-PCR . The antigen was subsequently processed and presented , resulting in stimulation of an H-2kd-restricted , gag-specific T cell hybridoma . Activation of the hybridoma , detected by P60568 production , was dose-dependent in the range of 0.1-20 microg DNA ( 10-2000 microg P00747 ) and was sustained up to 5 days after transfection . Thus , adsorption of plasmid DNA on P00747 -CTAB microparticles provides a potentially useful nonviral approach for in vitro transfection of dendritic cells . Gene Therapy ( 2000 ) 7 , 2105-2112 .
