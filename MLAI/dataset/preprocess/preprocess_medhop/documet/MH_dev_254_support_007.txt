Cellular mechanisms of the hemostatic effects of desmopressin ( DB00035 ) . The synthetic analog of vasopressin desmopressin ( DB00035 ) is widely used for the treatment of patients with von Willebrand disease ( VWD ) , hemophilia A , several platelet disorders , and uremic bleeding . DB00035 induces an increase in plasma levels of P04275 ( P04275 ) , coagulation factor VIII ( FVIII ) , and tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . It also has a vasodilatory action . In spite of its extensive clinical use , its cellular mechanism of action remains incompletely understood . Its effect on P04275 and t-PA as well as its vasodilatory effect are likely explained by a direct action on the endothelium , via activation of endothelial vasopressin P30518 receptor and DB02527 -mediated signaling . This leads to exocytosis from Weibel Palade bodies where both P04275 and t-PA are stored , as well as to nitric oxide ( NO ) production via activation of endothelial NO synthase . The mechanism of action of DB00035 on FVIII plasma levels remains to be elucidated . The hemostatic effect of DB00035 likely involves additional cellular effects that remain to be discovered .
