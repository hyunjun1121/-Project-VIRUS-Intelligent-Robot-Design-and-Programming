P25874 -mediated free fatty acid uncoupling of isolated cortical mitochondria from fasted animals : correlations to dietary modulations . Uncoupling proteins ( P25874 ) translocate protons from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the matrix , thereby " uncoupling " electron transport from the production of DB00171 . It has been shown that these proteins are highly expressed in animals maintained on the ketogenic diet ( KD ) . Although the exact mechanism remains unclear , it is known that these proteins are activated within a protective antireactive oxygen species ( ROS ) mechanism by free fatty acids ( FFA ) . In our current studies , mitochondrial samples were probed for the presence of P55851 , which is the most ubiquitously expressed P25874 isoform . We found that both traumatic brain injury and fasting upregulated the expression of P55851 , with a synergistic upregulation in fasted injured animals . We then used mitochondria from fasted naive animals to screen a number of FFA for their activation of uncoupling as well as their ability to reduce ROS . We found that arachidonic acid ( AA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , palmitoleic acid , myristic acid , and butyric acid increased mitochondrial uncoupling when added after oligomycin . These FFA , along with oleic acid , also reduced ROS in mitochondria incubated with oligomycin . In order to correlate our data to KD and fasting , both of which have been shown to be neuroprotective after neurologic insult , we determined the serum levels of FFA in KD and fasted animals using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy . We also determined brain and cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) FFA levels from fasted animals .
