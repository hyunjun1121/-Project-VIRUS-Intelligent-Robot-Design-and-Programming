Anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibody treatment in rheumatic disease . Interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of biological activities . P05231 transgene into mice gives rise to the abnormalities such as hypergammaglobulinaemia , thrombocytosis , infiltration of inflammatory cells into the tissues , mesangial cell proliferation of the kidney as well as splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy , which are predictable by the biological functions of P05231 shown in vitro . Continuous overproduction of P05231 is observed in patients with some immune-inflammatory diseases such as Castleman 's disease and rheumatoid arthritis that are frequently associated with similar abnormalities to those of P05231 transgenic mice , strongly suggesting the involvement of P05231 in the human diseases . Successful treatment of the model animals for immune-inflammatory diseases with anti- P05231 receptor ( P08887 ) antibody thus indicates the possible application of P05231 blocking agents to treat the P05231 related immune-inflammatory diseases of humans . In this review , the new therapeutic strategy for Castleman 's disease and RA using humanized antibody to human P05231 receptor , DB06273 , is discussed .
