P35354 induction and prostacyclin release by protease-activated receptors in endothelial cells require cooperation between mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB pathways . The functional significance of protease-activated receptors ( PARs ) in endothelial cells is largely undefined , and the intracellular consequences of their activation are poorly understood . Here , we show that the serine protease thrombin , a P25116 -selective peptide ( TFLLRN ) , and SLIGKV ( P55085 -selective peptide ) induce cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) protein and mRNA expression in human endothelial cells without modifying P23219 expression . P35354 induction was accompanied by sustained production of 6-keto-PGF1alpha , the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin , and this was inhibited by indomethacin and the P35354 -selective inhibitor NS398 . P25116 and P55085 stimulation rapidly activated both P27361 /2 and p38MAPK , and pharmacological blockade of MEK with either PD98059 or U0126 or of p38MAPK by SB203580 or SB202190 strongly inhibited thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced P35354 expression and 6-keto-PGF1alpha formation . Thrombin and peptide agonists of P25116 and P55085 increased luciferase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with an NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter adenovirus , and this , as well as PAR-induced 6-keto-PGF1alpha synthesis , was inhibited by co-infection with adenovirus encoding wild-type or mutated ( Y42F ) P25963 . Thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced P35354 expression and 6-keto-PGF1alpha generation were markedly attenuated by the NF-kappaB inhibitor PG490 and partially inhibited by the proteasome pathway inhibitor MG-132 . Activation of P25116 or P55085 promoted nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65-NF-kappaB , and thrombin-induced but not P55085 -induced p65-NF-kappaB phosphorylation was reduced by inhibition of MEK or p38MAPK . Activation of Q96RI0 by AYPGKF increased phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and p38MAPK without modifying NF-kappaB activation or P35354 induction . Our data show that P25116 and P55085 , but not Q96RI0 , are coupled with P35354 expression and sustained endothelial production of vasculoprotective prostacyclin by mechanisms that depend on P27361 /2 , p38MAPK , and P25963 -dependent NF-kappaB activation .
