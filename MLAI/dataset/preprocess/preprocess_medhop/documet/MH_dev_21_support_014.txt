Smad6s regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 through a protein kinase C-beta-dependent up-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is a serpin class protease inhibitor that plays a central role in the regulation of vascular function and tissue remodeling by modulating thrombosis , inflammation , and the extracellular matrix . A central mediator controlling P05121 is transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) , which induces its expression and promotes fibrosis . We have found that a unique member of the Smad family of signal transduction molecules , Smad6s , modulates the expression of P05121 . Overexpression of Smad6s in endothelial cells increases promoter activity and P05121 secretion , and an antisense to Smad6s suppresses the induction of P05121 by TGF-beta . The effect of Smad6s on the P05121 promoter appeared to be the result of increase binding of the forkhead winged helix factor FoxD1 to a TGF-beta-responsive element . Furthermore , the effect of Smad6s on P05121 up-regulation and on FoxD1 binding was found to result from up-regulation of TGF-beta and could be inhibited by the blocking TGF-beta signaling with O15105 . The ability of Smad6s to regulate the TGF-beta promoter and subsequent P05121 induction was suppressed by a selective protein kinase C-beta ( P05771 ) inhibitor . Consistent with the in vitro data , we found that increased Smad6s in diseased vessels correlated with increased TGF-beta and P05121 levels . Overall , our results demonstrate that the level of Smad6s can alter the level of TGF-beta and the subsequent induction of P05121 via a FoxD1 transcription site . Furthermore , our data suggest that this process , which is up-regulated in diseased vessels , can be modulated by the inhibition of P05771 .
