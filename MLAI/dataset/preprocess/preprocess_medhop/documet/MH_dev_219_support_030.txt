Intraspinal sarcoidosis : clinical features , MR imaging and electrophysiological study . We presented the case of a 58-year-old woman with spinal sarcoidosis at the C4- P13671 level . The lesion itself as visualized with magnetic resonance imaging , and its neurological findings responded favorably to treatment with prednisolone . Comparison of pre- and post-treatment values for somatosensory evoked potential ( O43157 ) and central motor conduction time ( CMCT ) also showed improvement . Analysis of O43157 and CMCT can be a useful tool for following up spinal sarcoidosis .
