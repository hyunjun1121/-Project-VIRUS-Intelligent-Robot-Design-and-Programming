Differential regulation of the serotonin 1 A transcriptional modulators five prime repressor element under dual repression-1 and nuclear-deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor by chronic stress . Chronic stress is known to affect brain areas involved in learning and emotional responses . These changes , thought to be related to the development of cognitive deficits are evident in major depressive disorder and other stress-related pathophysiologies . The serotonin-related transcription factors ( Q6P1N0 / Q6P1N0 ; five prime repressor element under dual repression/coiled-coil P06681 domain 1a , and O75398 /Deaf-1 ; nuclear-deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor ) are two important regulators of the P08908 receptor . Using Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) we examined the expression of mRNA and proteins for Q6P1N0 , O75398 , and the P08908 receptor in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) of male rats exposed to chronic restraint stress ( CRS ; 6 h/day for 21 days ) . After 21 days of CRS , significant reductions in both Q6P1N0 mRNA and protein were observed in the P27918 ( 36.8 % and 32 % , respectively ; P < 0.001 ) , while the levels of both O75398 protein and mRNA did not change significantly . Consistent with reduced Q6P1N0 protein , P08908 receptor mRNA levels were equally upregulated in the P27918 , while protein levels actually declined , suggesting post-transcriptional receptor downregulation . The data suggest that CRS produces distinct alterations in the serotonin system specifically altering Q6P1N0 and the P08908 receptor in the P27918 of the male rat while having no effect on O75398 . These results point to the importance of understanding the mechanism for the differential regulation of Q6P1N0 and O75398 in the P27918 as a basis for understanding the related effects of chronic stress on the serotonin system ( serotonin-related transcription factors ) and stress-related disorders like depression .
