Pharmacologic characterization of endothelin receptor responses in the isolated perfused rat lung . Endothelin receptor subtypes were characterized in isolated perfused rat lungs using the peptide P25101 -receptor antagonists BQ 610 and BQ 123 , the nonpeptide mixed P25101 -/ETB-receptor antagonist DB00559 , and the ETB-receptor agonist IRL 1620 . Intra-arterial injection of 1 nmol IRL 1620 caused an enhanced reduction in pulmonary conductance compared with 1 nmol endothelin ( ET-1 ) or 0.33 nmol IRL 1620 . Pretreatment of lungs with BQ 610 , BQ 123 , or DB00559 aggravated the bronchoconstriction induced by 1 nmol ET-1 so that it was comparable to that induced by 1 nmol IRL 1620 . Although perfusion with 1 nmol IRL 1620 had only minor effects on vascular conductance , 1 nmol ET-1 caused a marked decrease in this parameter . This vasonconstriction was prevented by BQ 610 , BQ 123 , or DB00559 . High concentrations of the stable prostacyclin metabolite , 6-keto-PGF1 alpha , were found in the perfusate of lungs treated with 1 nmol IRL 1620 or 1 nmol ET-1 . The ET-1-induced release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was blocked by DB00559 , but not by BQ 610 . ET-1 , but not IRL 1620 , provoked the release of thromboxane B2 . The main effect of P25101 -receptor stimulation is vasoconstriction , whereas ETB-receptor stimulation causes bronchoconstriction . Both actions , however , are attenuated by the other receptor , i.e. , the P25101 -induced vasoconstriction is attenuated by ETB-receptor-induced release of vasodilators such as prostacyclin , whereas the ETB-receptor-induced bronchoconstriction is attenuated by an unknown P25101 -receptor-dependent bronchodilatory mechanism .
