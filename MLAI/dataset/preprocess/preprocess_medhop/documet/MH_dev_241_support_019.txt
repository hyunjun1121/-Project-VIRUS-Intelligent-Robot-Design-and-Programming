3,3',4 ' , 5'-Tetramethoxychalcone inhibits human oral cancer cell proliferation and migration via p53-mediated mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis . BACKGROUND/AIM : The current study aimed to identify an attractive target against human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The effect of 3,3',4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone ( P46977 ) on OSCC cell proliferation , cell-cycle phase distribution , expression of markers of cell apoptosis , and cell migration were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay , flow cytometry , western blot , and transwell migration assay , respectively . RESULTS : Experimental results revealed that P46977 inhibited the OSCC cell proliferation ( fifty percent inhibitory concentrations range=1.0-4.5 μM ) by inducing G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle . P46977 caused DNA double-strand breaks , and enhanced expression of caspase-3 and -9 , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase , cytochrome c , calpain-1 and -2 , phosphorylation of histone P16104 , phosphorylation of checkpoint kinases 2 , p53 , P10415 -antagonist/killer and P10415 -associated × protein , while reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential , and expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 . In addition , P46977 reduced the migration potential of OSCC cells by attenuating the C-C chemokine ligand 5/ P51681 axis . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that P46977 may be considered an interesting target for further development of chemotherapeutic agents against oral cancer .
