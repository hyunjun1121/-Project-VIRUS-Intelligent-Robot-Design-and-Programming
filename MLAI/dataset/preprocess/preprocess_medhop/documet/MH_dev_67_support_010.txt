Rotenone remarkably attenuates oxidative stress , inflammation , and fibrosis in chronic obstructive uropathy . Mitochondrial abnormality has been shown in many kidney disease models . However , its role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases ( CKDs ) is still uncertain . In present study , a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone was applied to the mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) . Following 7-days rotenone treatment , a remarkable attenuation of tubular injury was detected by DB00233 staining . In line with the improvement of kidney morphology , rotenone remarkably blunted fibrotic response as shown by downregulation of fibronectin ( FN ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , collagen I , collagen III , and α-SMA , paralleled with a substantial decrease of TGF-β 1 . Meanwhile , the oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and heme oxygenase 1 ( P09601 ) and inflammatory markers P01375 -α , IL-1β , and P05362 were markedly decreased . More importantly , the reduction of mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial P03886 ( mtND1 ) expression in obstructed kidneys was moderately but significantly restored by rotenone , suggesting an amelioration of mitochondrial injury . Collectively , mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone protected kidneys against obstructive injury possibly via inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress , inflammation , and fibrosis , suggesting an important role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of obstructive kidney disease .
