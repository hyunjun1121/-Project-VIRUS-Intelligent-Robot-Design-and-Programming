[ Autoimmune aspects of treatment with P01375 inhibitors ] . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease , ankylosing spondylitis , psoriatic arthritis , and juvenile chronic arthritis . Recent years have brought improvement in the understanding of the pathogeneses of these diseases , resulting in the production of new groups of biological drugs , including , among others , anti- P01375 antibodies . The use of P01375 inhibitors has been a great advance in the treatment of patients with these inflammatory diseases . DB00065 and adalimumab are monoclonal antibodies that bind to and neutralize the activity of P01375 . DB00065 is a mouse/human chimera that joins the variable regions of a mouse antibody to the constant region of human IgG1 . DB00051 is a fully human IgG1 antibody . DB00005 is a dimeric fusion protein that joins the human p75 P01375 receptor to the Fc domain of human IgG1 . The beneficial effects of the anti- P01375 monoclonal antibodies infliximab and adalimumab and the soluble receptor fusion protein etanercept in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , especially in patients resistant to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) , are discussed . We observe stoppage of articular destruction during treatment with P01375 inhibitors . Soon after the introduction of this therapy it was found that these agents have a propensity for stimulating the production of autoantibodies and antibodies against themselves . In this review , recent studies analyzing the effect of P01375 blockade ( infliximab , etanercept , and adalimumab ) on the Q14201 , anti-dsDNA , and anticardiolipin antibody profiles in autoimmune diseases are discussed .
