Acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and interstitial nephritis secondary to iodine and mefenamic acid . DB00784 ingestion , usually in excess and over prolonged period is known to produce interstitial nephritis , or less commonly papillary necrosis , with acute renal failure . However , it is not dose-dependent for the induction of tubulointerstitial damage . Excess iodine ingestion is known to produce toxicity and possible death , but acute renal failure is rare . There is evidence from clinical and experimental data that iodine has toxic effect on tubular epithelial cells . Iodine has not been documented to produce red cell hemolysis and hemoglobinuria . We present a unique case of acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and acute interstitial nephritis secondary to suicidal ingestion of potassium iodide solution and also ingestion of a few mefenamic acid tablets . These agents led to potentiation of the renal injury from hemoglobinuric tubulopathy , probably from the iodine , and renal dysfunction from alteration of renal perfusion by selective P23219 inhibition of prostaglandin production , and induction of acute interstitial nephritis from mefenamic acid , leading to acute renal failure which was reversible by hemodialysis and supportive therapy .
