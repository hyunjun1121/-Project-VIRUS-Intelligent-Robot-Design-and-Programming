Species difference in glucuronidation formation kinetics with a selective P42345 inhibitor . The mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) is a protein kinase that shows key involvement in age-related disease and promises to be a target for treatment of cancer . In the present study , the elimination of potent DB00171 -competitive P42345 inhibitor 3-(6-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)-N-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-2-amine ( compound 1 ) is studied in bile duct-cannulated rats , and the metabolism of compound 1 in liver microsomes is compared across species . Compound 1 was shown to undergo extensive N-glucuronidation in bile duct-catheterized rats . N-glucuronides were detected on positions N1 ( M2 ) and N2 ( M1 ) of the pyrazole moiety as well as on the primary amine ( M3 ) . All three N-glucuronide metabolites were detected in liver microsomes of the rat , dog , and human , while primary amine glucuronidation was not detected in cynomolgus monkey . In addition , N1- and N2-glucuronidation showed strong species selectivity in vitro , with rat , dog , and human favoring N2-glucuronidation and monkey favoring N1-glucuronide formation . Formation of M1 in monkey liver microsomes also followed sigmoidal kinetics , singling out monkey as unique among the species with regard to compound 1 N-glucuronidation . In this respect , monkeys might not always be the best animal model for N-glucuronidation of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( P78381 ) 1A9 or P22309 substrates in humans . The impact of N-glucuronidation of compound 1 could be more pronounced in higher species such as monkey and human , leading to high clearance in these species . While compound 1 shows promise as a candidate for investigating the impact of pan- P42345 inhibition in vivo , opportunities may exist through medicinal chemistry efforts to reduce metabolic liability with the goal of improving systemic exposure .
