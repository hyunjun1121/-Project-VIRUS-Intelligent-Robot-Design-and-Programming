Effects of chimeric somatostatin-dopamine molecules on human peripheral blood lymphocytes activation . O43521 23A761 , selective for somatostatin receptors subtypes 2 , 5 and the dopamine receptor subtype 2 , and O43521 23A757 with affinity for P30874 and DAR2 were studied on human PBL proliferation and activation . O43521 23A761 was significantly more potent than specific SSTR and DAR2 agonists in suppressing lymphocyte proliferation induced by mitogen or alloantigen , while O43521 23A757 was more potent than specific P30874 and DAR2 agonists in suppressing antigen induced proliferation only . Both molecules displayed enhanced potency in suppressing IFNgamma and P05231 secretion compared with the SSTR and DAR2 analogs , while only O43521 23A761 was able to inhibit P60568 secretion and its effect is more potent than the control analogs . Furthermore O43521 23A761 inhibit cell progression into the S phase and then into the G2/M , while O43521 23A757 inhibited bromodeoxyuridine incorporation only during the S phase . Both chimeric molecules resulted significantly more effective than the respective controls .
