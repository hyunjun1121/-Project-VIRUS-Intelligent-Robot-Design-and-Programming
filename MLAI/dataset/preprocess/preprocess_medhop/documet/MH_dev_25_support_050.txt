Cell cycle arrest induced by engagement of Q7Z7D3 on Epstein-Barr virus-positive B-cell lymphoma cell lines . Q7Z7D3 is a recently discovered P33681 family member that has inhibitory effects on T-cell immunity . However , the reverse signalling mechanism of the Q7Z7D3 -expressing cells remains unclear . Previous work has shown that Q7Z7D3 expression was enhanced on B cells following Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection , and engagement of cell-surface-expressed Q7Z7D3 induces cell death of EBV-transformed B cells . Here we found that Q7Z7D3 was constitutively expressed on EBV-positive lymphoma cells , Raji and IM-9 cells , but was not expressed on EBV-negative lymphoma cells ( Ramos ) . Engagement of Q7Z7D3 significantly reduced cell growth of Raji and IM-9 cells and resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0- P55008 phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner . To clarify the mechanism of cell cycle arrest via activation of Q7Z7D3 , cell cycle regulatory factors were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting . We found that Q7Z7D3 triggered down-regulation of P11802 /6 and up-regulation of P38936 expression at both protein and RNA levels . Furthermore , P24941 and cyclin E/D expression was down-regulated by Q7Z7D3 triggering . Additionally , the down-regulation of phospho-AKT and phospho-cyclin E were clearly detected in Q7Z7D3 -activated Raji cells , but the phosphorylation of p53 was constitutively maintained . These results indicate that Q7Z7D3 -mediated signalling on EBV-positive B-cell lymphoma cells modulates the cell cycle through down-regulation of the AKT pathway . Consequently , Q7Z7D3 may be a new potential target for use in EBV-positive lymphoma therapy .
