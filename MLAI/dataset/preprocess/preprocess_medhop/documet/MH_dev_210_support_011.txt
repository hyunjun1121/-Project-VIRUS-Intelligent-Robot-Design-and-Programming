[ Effects of plasminogen and streptokinase on the vital functions of nervous tissue cells in culture ] . In the protein-deficient media plasminogen stimulated the vital functions of cells and in concentrations 10(-7)-10(-10) M it protected cells of sympathetic ganglia , neocortex and continues cell lines under damaging actions of H2O2 ( 0.0001 M ) , NH4CI ( 0.01 M ) and cooling . DB00086 essentially influenced the mode of damaging effect of DB00171 ( 0.001 M ) . Even a short-term exposition ( 20 min ) of PC12 cells with both proteins ( each in the concentration 10(-9) M ) led to sharp alterations in intracellular DB00171 - or Ca(2+)-activated proteolysis . In some cases plasminogen and streptokinase provided acceleration of cultured tissue maturation , improvement of cell adhesion , high survival rate , the increase in quantity and length of processes and their arborisation . Electronic microscopy established the character of structural rearrangements of nervous tissue cells ( neurons , astrocytes , oligodendrocytes ) , reflecting the protective action of plasminogen and streptokinase . In the presence of plasminogen and especially streptokinase , the total number of cultured glioma P13671 and neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells , the intracellular contents of protein , RNA and DNA increased several-fold . Addition of plasminogen promoted formation of processes by neuroblastoma cells , this suggests initiation of differentiation of cellular elements . In cultures of sensitive and sympathetic ganglia streptokinase increased proliferation of Schwann cells . These proteins did not cause transformation of PC12 enterochromaffine cells to neurons , though plasminogen facilitated it . P00747 addition to cell cultures did not increase fibrinolytic activity of the culture medium in the culture medium , and streptokinase did not lose its plasminogen-activating capacity .
