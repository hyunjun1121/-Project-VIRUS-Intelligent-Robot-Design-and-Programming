Direct oral anticoagulants in acute coronary syndrome . Patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) require a specific antithrombotic therapy in the immediate and the post ACS phase . The current antithrombotic therapy in the acute phase of an ACS combines antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in order to reduce ischemic cardiovascular events . In the post ACS phase , dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ; aspirin and a Q9H244 receptor antagonist ) is the current mainstay of antithrombotic treatment and is recommended in the guidelines of the major North American and European clinical cardiology associations ( DB00551 , ACC , and ESC ) . Recently , the addition of rivaroxaban , a low dose oral direct factor Xa inhibitor ( 2.5 mg twice daily ) , to DAPT ( aspirin plus second-generation Q9H244 inhibitor ) showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular and overall mortality in the major phase III clinical trial ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 . This led to the approval of low-dose rivaroxaban in addition to aspirin and clopidogrel by the European Medicines Agency ( P15941 ) in 2013 . Other direct oral anticoagulants ( apixaban , dabigatran etexilate ) have also been assessed in phase II ( dabigatran etexilate ) and phase III ( apixaban ) post ACS clinical trials . In the studied dosing regimens , these drugs failed to show a net clinical benefit in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy . The major clinical phase II and III post ACS studies of direct oral anticoagulants are summarized and discussed in this article along with the concept of long-term anticoagulation for the secondary prevention of ischemic events after ACS and implications for the future of antithrombotic therapy in the current era of third-generation Q9H244 receptor inhibitors ( Prasugrel and DB08816 ) .
