Neural cell adhesion molecules modulate tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin in nerve growth cone membranes . Triggering neural cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily with specific ligands or antibodies inhibited the phosphorylation of tryosyl residues in a subpopulation of alpha- and beta-tubulin associated with membranes from a subcellular fraction of nerve growth cones from fetal rat brain . Preincubation of these membranes with purified extracellular fragments of Q9NUQ9 , N- P62158 , or myelin-associated glycoprotein , or with antibodies directed against the extracellular domains of Q9NUQ9 or N- P62158 , inhibited P12931 -dependent phosphorylation of tubulin in an endogenous membrane kinase reaction . Other proteins that affect neurite outgrowth ( fibronectin , laminin , antibodies against P19022 ) had no effect . The results suggest that cell adhesion molecules transduce cell surface events to intracellular signals by modulating the activity of protein tyrosine kinases or phosphatases in axonal membranes to influence cytoskeletal dynamics at the growth cone .
