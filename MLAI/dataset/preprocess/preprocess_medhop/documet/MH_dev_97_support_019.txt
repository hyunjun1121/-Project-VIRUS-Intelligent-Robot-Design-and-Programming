Effects of chrisotherapeutic gold compounds on prostaglandin E2 production . The mechanism of action of anti-rheumatic gold compounds on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) -induced prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) production in rat peritoneal macrophages were examined . DB00995 ( AF ) at 3-10 muM inhibited TPA-induced PGE(2) production in a concentration-dependent manner . In the pharmacological experiments , prostaglandin G/H synthase ( PGHS ) -2-dependent PGE(2) production was inhibited by 10 muM of AF . The enzyme activities of both P23219 and P35354 were not affected by the 10 muM AF . Other gold compounds , aurothioglucose ( ATG ) and aurothiomalate ( Q13315 ) did not inhibit DB00917 production at 10 muM . AF decreased the P35354 protein content , but had no effect on the P23219 protein content . AF at 3-10 muM decreased the P35354 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) level by RT-PCR determination . Then , the effect of AF on nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) , one of the transcription factors known to regulate transcription of a group of proinflammatory proteins , was determined . AF at 1-10 muM inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a concentration-dependent manner . ATG and Q13315 at 10 muM did not inhibit NF-kappaB nuclear translocation , but with 20 h preincubation , ATG and Q13315 inhibited PGE(2) production and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation . AF , ATG , and Q13315 did not affect the binding of NF-kappaB to its specific DNA . These observations may suggest that the effects of gold compounds on the inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation plays one of the major role in its anti-inflammatory effects in rat peritoneal macrophages .
