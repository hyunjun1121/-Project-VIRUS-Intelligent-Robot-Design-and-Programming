Five-year safety and efficacy of belatacept in renal transplantation . DB06681 is a first-in-class co-stimulation blocker in development for primary maintenance immunosuppression . A Phase II study comparing belatacept with cyclosporine ( DB00091 ) for prevention of acute rejection and protection of renal function in kidney transplant recipients demonstrated similar efficacy and significantly higher measured Q92565 at 1 year for belatacept , but the incidence of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was higher . Here , we present the results for the extension of this trial , which aimed to assess long-term safety and efficacy of belatacept . Seventy-eight of 102 patients who were receiving belatacept and the 16 of 26 who were receiving DB00091 completed the long-term extension period . Q92565 remained stable in patients who were receiving belatacept for 5 years , and the incidences of death/graft loss or acute rejection were low . The frequencies of serious infections were 16 % for belatacept and 27 % for DB00091 , and neoplasms occurred in 12 % of each group . No patients who were treated with belatacept and one patient who was treated with DB00091 developed posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder during the follow-up period . Serious gastrointestinal disorders occurred more frequently with belatacept ( 12 % belatacept versus 8 % DB00091 ) , and serious cardiac disorders occurred more frequently with DB00091 ( 2 % belatacept versus 12 % DB00091 ) . Pharmacokinetic analyses showed consistent exposure to belatacept over time . P42081 receptor saturation was higher in patients who were receiving belatacept every 4 weeks ( 74 % ) compared with every 8 weeks ( 56 % ) . In conclusion , this study demonstrated high patient persistence with intravenous belatacept , stable renal function , predictable pharmacokinetics , and good safety with belatacept over 5 years .
