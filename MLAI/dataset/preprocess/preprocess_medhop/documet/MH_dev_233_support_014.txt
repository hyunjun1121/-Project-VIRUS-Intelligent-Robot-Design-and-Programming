Reverse-phase protein array for prediction of patients at low risk of developing bone metastasis from breast cancer . BACKGROUND : A biomarker that predicts bone metastasis based on a protein laboratory assay has not been demonstrated . Reverse-phase protein array ( RPPA ) enables quantification of total and phosphorylated proteins , providing information about their functional status . The aim of this study was to identify bone-metastasis-related markers in patients with primary breast cancer using RPPA analysis . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Tumor samples were obtained from 169 patients with primary invasive breast carcinoma who underwent surgery . The patients were categorized by whether they developed breast cancer bone metastasis ( BCBM ) during follow-up . Clinical characteristics and protein expression by RPPA were compared and verified by leave-one-out cross-validation . RESULTS : Lymph node status ( p = .023 ) and expression level of 22 proteins by RPPA were significantly correlated with BCBM in logistic regression analysis . These variables were used to build a logistic regression model . After filtering the variables through a stepwise algorithm , the final model , consisting of 8 proteins and lymph node status , had sensitivity of 30.0 % , specificity of 90.5 % , positive predictive value of 30.0 % , and negative predictive value of 90.5 % in the cross-validation . Most of the identified proteins were associated with cell cycle or signal transduction ( P24941 , P38936 , Rb1 , Src , phosphorylated-ribosomal S6 kinase , P04626 , Q9H165 , and P35749 ) . CONCLUSION : Our validated model , in which the primary tumor is tested with RPPA , can predict patients who are at low risk of developing BCBM and thus who likely would not benefit from receiving a bisphosphonate in the adjuvant setting . Clinical trials excluding these patients have the potential to clarify the benefit of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting .
