DB01708 prevents the aggregation of platelets obtained from postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus through the activation of the PKC/ P29474 /NO pathway . The steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone ( DB01708 ) , suggested to be a cardioprotector , prevents platelet aggregation in healthy humans . This hormone is reduced in postmenopausal women by 60 % of its normal value . Platelets in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) are more sensitive to aggregation , which has been attributed to a reduced ability to produce nitric oxide ( NO ) . In light of these precedents and considering that DB01708 is able to increase the production of NO in cultured endothelial cells , we suggest that DB01708 prevents the aggregation of platelet from postmenopausal women with T2D through the activation of PKC/ P29474 /NO/cGMP pathway . To determine the effect of DB01708 in platelet aggregation , platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) obtained from postmenopausal women with T2D was preincubated with DB01708 , and aggregation induced by ADP was determined in the presence or absence of DB04223 ( LNG-nitroarginine ) , Rottlerin , NOS , or PKC delta inhibitors , respectively . Platelet NO production was measured with the fluorescent probe DAF2DA and P29474 activation was determined by Western blot , using an anti-p- P29474 ( ser 1177 ) antibody . DB01708 1 ) prevented platelet aggregation by 40 % compared to control , 2 ) increased NO production by 63 % , 3 ) increased p- P29474 ( phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase ) levels , and 4 ) increased cGMP production . These effects were reduced in the presence of DB04223 or Rottlerin . DB01708 prevents platelet aggregation induced by ADP . This effect is mediated by the activation of the PKCÎ´/ P29474 /NO/cGMP pathway . Our results suggest that DB01708 could be considered to be a potential therapeutic tool in the prevention of atherothrombotic processes in postmenopausal women with T2D .
