Association analysis between 12 genetic variants of ten genes and personality traits in a young chinese Han population . Some genes involved in neurotransmission synthesis and transmission have been hypothesized to affect personality traits . To investigate the possible roles of these genes in personality traits of 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire , we performed a population-based study in a young Chinese Han cohort . In the study , we selected some functional variations in ten candidate genes ( P21964 , P09172 , DRD(2) , DRD(3) , Q01959 , P21397 , GRM(1) , Q13224 , 5-TH(2A) , and 5-TH(6) ) encoding components in dopamine , glutamate , and 5-hydroxytryptamine pathways . The results showed the T102C in 5-TH(2A) was associated with X3 ( emotional and quiet alertness ) and B ( reasoning ) ( F = 4.71 and 6.23 ; p = 0.009 and 0.002 ) , Val158Met in P21964 with E ( dominance ) ( F = 7.01 ; p = 0.0009 ) , while the variations in P09172 , DRD(2) , DRD(3) , P21397 , GRM(1) , Q13224 , and 5-TH(6) were not associated with any of the personality traits . This finding suggests that T102C in 5-TH(2A) and Val158Met in P21964 play roles in some human personality traits .
