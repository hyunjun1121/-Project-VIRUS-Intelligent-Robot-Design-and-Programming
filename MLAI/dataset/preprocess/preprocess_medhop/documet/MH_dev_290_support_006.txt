DB00139 modulates Ca(2+) transient and cardiomyocyte viability through PKA-dependent pathway . Q9BXA5 is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that has been characterized as a receptor for succinate , a citric acid cycle intermediate , in several tissues . In the heart , the role of succinate is unknown . We now report that rat ventricular cardiomyocytes express Q9BXA5 . We found that succinate , through Q9BXA5 , increases the amplitude and the rate of decline of global Ca(2+) transient , by increasing the phosphorylation levels of ryanodine receptor and phospholamban , two well known Ca(2+) handling proteins . The effects of succinate on Ca(2+) transient were abolished by pre-treatment with adenylyl cyclase and DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) inhibitors . Direct PKA activation by succinate was further confirmed using a FRET-based A-kinase activity reporter . Additionally , succinate decreases cardiomyocyte viability through a caspase-3 activation pathway , effect also prevented by PKA inhibition . Taken together , these observations show that succinate acts as a signaling molecule in cardiomyocytes , modulating global Ca(2+) transient and cell viability through a PKA-dependent pathway .
