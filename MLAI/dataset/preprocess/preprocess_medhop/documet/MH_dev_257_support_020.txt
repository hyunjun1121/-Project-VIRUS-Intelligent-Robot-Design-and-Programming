P51587 and P84022 synergize in regulation of gene transcription . P84022 is an essential component in the intracellular signaling of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFbeta ) , which is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation . P51587 is a tumor suppressor involved in early onset of breast , ovarian and prostate cancer . Both P84022 and P51587 possess transcription activation domains . Here , we show that P84022 and P51587 interact functionally and physically . We found that P51587 forms a complex with P84022 in vitro and in vivo , and that both MH1 and MH2 domains of P84022 contribute to the interaction . TGFbeta1 stimulates interaction of endogenous P84022 and P51587 in non-transfected cells . P51587 co-activates P84022 -dependent transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) . P84022 increases the transcriptional activity of P51587 fused to the DNA-binding domain ( DBD ) of Gal4 , and reciprocally , P51587 co-activates DBD-Gal4- P84022 . Thus , our results show that P51587 and P84022 form a complex and synergize in regulation of transcription .
