Evidence that Q13507 is a molecular component of the DB00136 -activated capacitative calcium entry ( CCE ) in muscle and osteoblast cells . In chick skeletal muscle and in rat osteoblast-like cells ( ROS 17/2.8 ) , 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-Vitamin-D(3) [ 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] stimulates release of Ca(2+) from inner stores and extracellular cation influx through both voltage-dependent and capacitative Ca(2+) entry ( CCE ) channels . We investigated the involvement of TRPC proteins in CCE induced by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) . Two fragments were amplified by RT-PCR , exhibiting > 85 % sequence homology with human Q13507 . Northern and Western blots employing Q13507 -probes and anti- Q13507 antibodies , respectively , confirmed endogenous expression of a Q13507 -like protein . Both cell types transfected with anti- Q13507 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides showed reduced CCE and Mn(2+) entry induced by either thapsigargin or 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) . In muscle cells , anti- P11473 antisense inhibited steroid-induced Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) influx and co-immunoprecipitation of Q13507 and P11473 was observed , suggesting an association between both proteins and a functional role of the receptor in 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) activation of CCE . In osteoblasts , two PCR fragments showing high homology with human INAD-like sequences were obtained . Northern blot and antisense functional assays suggested the involvement of the INAD-like protein in CCE regulation by the hormone . Therefore , we propose that an endogenous Q13507 protein mediates 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) modulation of CCE in muscle and osteoblastic cells , which seems to implicate P11473 - Q13507 association and the participation of a INAD-like scaffold protein .
