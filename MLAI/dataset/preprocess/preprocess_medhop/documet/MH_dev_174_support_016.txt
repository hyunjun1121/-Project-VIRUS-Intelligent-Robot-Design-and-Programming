Characterization of novel germline c-kit gene mutation , P10721 -Tyr553Cys , observed in a family with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors . We found a novel type germline mutation at exon 11 of the c-kit gene , which results in a substitution of DB00135 to DB00151 at codon 553 of the c-kit gene product ( P10721 -Tyr553Cys ) , in a 68-year-old female patient with multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) . In the present study , we carried out mutational analysis in her family members to determine the carriers and characterized the mutation by introducing the corresponding mutation ( murine P10721 -Tyr552Cys ) into expression vector possessing murine c-kit cDNA . Mutational analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes of her family members revealed that a 44-year-old son had the same mutation , but at present he had neither apparent symptoms nor images of multiple GISTs . By transfection with the expression vector possessing the murine mutant c-kit cDNA , interleukin-3-dependent Ba/ P13726 murine lymphoid cells started growing autonomously without any growth factors , indicating that the mutation was considered to be of gain-of-function . Imatinib , a small molecule of tyrosine kinase inhibitor , effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of P10721 -Tyr552Cys . DB04868 , another small molecule of the P10721 inhibitor , also effectively inhibited autophosphorylation of P10721 -Tyr552Cys . In fact , proliferation of Ba/ P13726 cells expressing P10721 -Tyr552Cys was effectively inhibited by both imatinib and nilotinib . These findings indicate that the novel type human P10721 -Tyr553Cys mutation is the cause of the present familial and multiple GISTs , and that both imatinib and nilotinib might effectively inhibit the growth of GISTs developing in the patients of this family .
