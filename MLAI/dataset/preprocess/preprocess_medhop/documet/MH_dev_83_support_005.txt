Aggravated endoplasmic reticulum stress as a basis for enhanced glioblastoma cell killing by bortezomib in combination with celecoxib or its non-coxib analogue , 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib . The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( Velcade ) is known to trigger endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress via the accumulation of obsolete and damaged proteins . The selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor celecoxib ( DB00482 ) causes ER stress through a different mechanism ( i.e. , by causing leakage of calcium from the ER into the cytosol ) . Each of these two mechanisms has been implicated in the anticancer effects of the respective drug . We therefore investigated whether the combination of these two drugs would lead to further increased ER stress and would enhance their antitumor efficacy . With the use of human glioblastoma cell lines , we show that this is indeed the case . When combined , bortezomib and celecoxib triggered elevated expression of the ER stress markers P11021 / P11021 and P35638 / P35638 , caused activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and ER stress-associated caspase-4 , and greatly increased apoptotic cell death . Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the protective ER chaperone P11021 / P11021 further sensitized the tumor cells to killing by the drug combination . The contribution of celecoxib was independent of the inhibition of P35354 because a non-coxib analogue of this drug , 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib ( Q6UXB2 ) , faithfully and more potently mimicked these combination effects in vitro and in vivo . Taken together , our results show that combining bortezomib with celecoxib or Q6UXB2 very potently triggers the ER stress response and results in greatly increased glioblastoma cytotoxicity . We propose that this novel drug combination should receive further evaluation as a potentially effective anticancer therapy .
