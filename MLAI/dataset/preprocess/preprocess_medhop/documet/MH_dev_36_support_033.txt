Q9NQ38 and P07550 haplotypes are risk factors for asthma in Mexican pediatric patients . BACKGROUND : Asthma is one of the most common respiratory diseases worldwide , and the complexity of its etiology has been widely documented . Chromosome 5q31-33 is one of the main loci implicated in asthma and asthma-related traits . P35225 , P08571 and P07550 , which are located in this risk locus , are among the genes most strongly associated with asthma susceptibility . OBJECTIVES : This study evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes at 5q31-33 conferred risk for asthma in Mexican-Mestizo pediatric patients . METHODS : We performed a case-controlled study including 851 individuals , 421 of them affected with childhood-onset asthma and 430 ethnically matched unaffected subjects . We used the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay to genotype 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within P05113 , Q92878 , P35225 , P05112 , P08571 , Q9NQ38 , Q13639 , P07550 and P29460 . RESULTS : Although no association was detected for any risk allele , three Q9NQ38 haplotypes ( O75223 : p = 6 × 10(-6) ; AATC : p = 0.0001 ; AGTT : p = 0.0001 ) and five P07550 haplotypes ( AGGACC : p = 0.0014 ; AGGAAG : p = 0.0002 ; TGAGAG : p = 0.0001 ; AGGAAC : p = 0.0002 ; AAGGAG : p = 0.003 ) were associated with asthma . Notably , the AGTT Q9NQ38 haplotype exhibited a male gender-dependent association ( p = 7.6 × 10(-5) ) . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that Q9NQ38 and P07550 haplotypes might play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma .
