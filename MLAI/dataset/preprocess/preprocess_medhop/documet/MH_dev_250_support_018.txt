Antagonizing amyloid-β/calcium-sensing receptor signaling in human astrocytes and neurons : a key to halt Alzheimer 's disease progression ? Astrocytes ' roles in late-onset Alzheimer 's disease ( LOAD ) promotion are important , since they survive soluble or fibrillar amyloid-β peptides ( Aβs ) neurotoxic effects , undergo alterations of intracellular and intercellular Ca(2+) signaling and gliotransmitters release via the Aβ/α7-nAChR ( α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ) signaling , and overproduce/oversecrete newly synthesized Aβ42 oligomers , NO , and P15692 via the Aβ/ P41180 ( calcium-sensing receptor ) signaling . Recently , it was suggested that the NMDAR ( N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ) inhibitor nitromemantine would block the synapse-destroying effects of Aβ/α7-nAChR signaling . Yet , this and the progressive extracellular accrual and spreading of Aβ42 oligomers would be stopped well upstream by P0C0P6 2143 , an allosteric P41180 antagonist ( calcilytic ) .
