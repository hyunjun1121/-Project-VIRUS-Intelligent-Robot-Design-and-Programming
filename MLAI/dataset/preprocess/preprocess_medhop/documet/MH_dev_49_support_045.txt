Molecular pathways : the basis for rational combination using MEK inhibitors in P01116 -mutant cancers . Mutations in DB01367 oncogenes are frequently observed in human cancers , and the mutations result in activation of the DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , leading to cell proliferation and survival . The pathway is , therefore , a potent therapeutic target in the DB01367 -mutant cancers . MEK inhibitors can specifically block the pathway and are one of the key types of drugs for the treatment of the DB01367 -mutant cancers . As DB01367 proteins activate other downstream signaling proteins in addition to the DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 pathway , combination therapeutic approaches with MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated . Moreover , MEK inhibitors can arrest cancer cells in P55008 phase and repress prosurvival Bcl2 family proteins such as Q07820 and P10415 /BCLXL , and increase expression of Bim , a proapoptotic BH3-only family protein . This mechanism may explain the efficacy of the combination of MEK inhibitors with cytotoxic agents or other targeted inhibitors . A better understanding of the pathway will help us with development of rational combinations for the treatment of the DB01367 -mutant cancers .
