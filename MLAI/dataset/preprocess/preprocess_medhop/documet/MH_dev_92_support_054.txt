A case of CPT deficiency , homoplasmic mtDNA mutation and ragged red fibers at muscle biopsy . A 45-year-old male patient had an episode of acute renal failure with myoglobinuria , myalgias , weakness , and markedly increased serum CK levels . Similar episodes had occurred in the past . DB00583 palmitoyl-transferase II ( P23786 ) deficiency was documented both biochemically and genetically . Interestingly , muscle biopsy also showed some ragged red fibers ( Q96E11 ) and complete mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) sequence disclosed a homoplasmic T3394C point mutation . This mutation is described in Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( LHON ) or in patients with diabetes mellitus .
