P00747 activators and plasmin in lung cancer . DB00013 plasminogen activator and plasmin contribute to detach neoplastic cells from solid tumor and facilitate the movement of these cells through interstitium and capillary walls as well as infiltration of the surrounding structures . P00747 activators inhibitors fulfill a regulatory function in these processes . Determining activity and concentration , finding subcellular , cellular and zonal localization of every component of plasminogen activation system has diagnostic and prognostic importance in different lung cancer types .
