Influence of cholecalciferol supplementation in hemodialysis patients on monocyte subsets : a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Although most hemodialysis patients share a significant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] deficiency , supplementation is controversially discussed . A potential influence on monocyte and T lymphocyte dysfunction advocates blood level-adapted supplementation as recommended by K/DOQI guidelines . This was a prospective double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial examining immune effects of 12 weeks of cholecalciferol supplementation . METHODS : We initiated serum level-adapted de novo cholecalciferol supplementation in 38 hemodialysis patients . Outcome measures were : monocyte subset cell counts ( P08571 +CD16++ vs. P08571 ++CD16+ vs. P08571 ++CD16- ) , lymphocyte Th1/Th2 differentiation frequencies , serum inflammatory proteins CRP and TNFα , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , Q9GZV9 , and α- Q9UEF7 . RESULTS : At baseline , the mean 25(OH)D serum level in the study population was 31.7 ± 14.3 nmol/l , and only 3 % of patients had levels within the normal range . At 12 weeks , 25(OH)D levels were normalized in the verum group ( 87.8 ± 22.3 vs. placebo 24.6 ± 8.0 nmol/l , p < 0.0001 ) . In parallel , 1,25(OH)2D levels increased in the verum group . Monocyte subset cell counts as well as Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte frequencies did not change significantly after 12 weeks of cholecalciferol supplementation . There was also no significant difference in PTH , alkaline phosphatase , calcium , phosphate , TNFα , Q9GZV9 , α- Q9UEF7 and CRP levels . CONCLUSIONS : Oral cholecalciferol supplementation according to the K/DOQI recommendations normalizes 25(OH)D levels without relevant side effects such as hyperphosphatemia or hypercalcemia . However , beneficial pleiotropic effects on monocyte subset cell counts , T cell differentiation , or cytokine production could not be confirmed at least at the used dosage . PTH and Q9GZV9 levels were not affected during cholecalciferol administration .
