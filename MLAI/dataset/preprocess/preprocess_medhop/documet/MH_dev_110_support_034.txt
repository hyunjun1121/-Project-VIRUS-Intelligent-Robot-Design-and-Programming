[ Neuropsychopharmacology of DB00470 ] . Today , the main route of introduction of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the main active substance of cannabis , into the human body is via the lungs , from smokes produced by combustion of a haschich-tobacco mixture . The use of a water pipe ( nargileh-like ) intensifies its fast supply to the body . THC reaches the brain easily where it stimulates P21554 receptors ; their ubiquity underlies a wide variety of effects . THC disappears from extracellular spaces by dissolving in lipid rich membranes , and not by excretion from the body . This is followed by a slow release , leading to long lasting effects originating from brain areas containing a large proportion of spare receptors ( " reserve receptors " ) . Far from mimicking the effects of endocannabinoids , THC caricatures and disturbs them . It induces both psychical and physical dependencies , but the perception of withdrawal is weak on account of its very slow elimination . THC disturbs cognition . Acutely , it develops anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects , which causes a lot of users to abuse THC , thus leading to a tolerance ( desensitization of P21554 receptors ) making anxiety and depression to reappear more intensely than originally . THC has close relationships with schizophrenia . It incites to tobacco , alcohol and heroine abuses .
