Evolution of spatially coexpressed families of type-2 vomeronasal receptors in rodents . The vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) is an olfactory structure for the detection of pheromones . VNO neurons express three groups of unrelated G-protein-coupled receptors . Type-2 vomeronasal receptors ( V2Rs ) are specifically localized in the basal neurons of the VNO and are believed to sense protein pheromones eliciting specific reproductive behaviors . In murine species , V2Rs are organized into four families . Family-ABD V2Rs are expressed monogenically and coexpress with family-C V2Rs of either subfamily C1 ( V2RC1 ) or subfamily P06681 ( V2RC2 ) , according to a coordinate temporal diagram . Neurons expressing the phylogenetically ancient V2RC1 coexpress family-BD V2Rs or a specific group of subfamily-A V2Rs ( V2RA8-10 ) , whereas a second neuronal subset ( V2RC2-positive ) coexpresses a recently expanded group of five subfamily-A V2Rs ( V2RA1-5 ) along with vomeronasal-specific Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules ( H2-Mv ) . Through database mining and Sanger sequencing , we have analyzed the onset , diversification , and expansion of the P30518 -families throughout the phylogeny of Rodentia . Our results suggest that the separation of V2RC1 and V2RC2 occurred in a Cricetidae ancestor in coincidence with the evolution of the H2-Mv genes ; this phylogenetic event did not correspond with the origin of the coexpressing V2RA1-5 genes , which dates back to an ancestral myomorphan lineage . Interestingly , the evolution of receptors within the V2RA1-5 group may be implicated in the origin and diversification of some of the P30518 putative cognate ligands , the exocrine secreting peptides . The establishment of V2RC2 , which probably reflects the complex expansion and diversification of family-A V2Rs , generated receptors that have probably acquired a more subtle functional specificity .
