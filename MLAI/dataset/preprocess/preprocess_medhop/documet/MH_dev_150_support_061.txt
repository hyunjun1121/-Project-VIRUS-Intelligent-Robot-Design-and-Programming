Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction caused by anti-M antibody in a patient receiving interleukin-2 and interferon for metastatic renal cell cancer . Anti-M is usually a naturally occurring cold-reactive immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody , often with an immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) component , and is seldom implicated in delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions ( P10275 ) . However , cases have been reported . In the majority , a P10275 is not suspected until further blood is requested and a new antibody is detected on pretransfusion testing . We describe the case of a young man receiving therapy with interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) and interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) for metastatic renal cell cancer who developed a clinically suspected P10275 that was confirmed serologically to be caused by anti-M , reactive at 37 degrees C . We discuss the possible role of his biochemotherapy in the development of the P10275 .
