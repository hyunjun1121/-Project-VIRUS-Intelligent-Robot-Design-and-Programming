Inhibition of the leukotriene synthetase of rat basophil leukemia cells by diethylcarbamazine , and synergism between diethylcarbamazine and piriprost , a P09917 inhibitor . DB00711 inhibited the formation of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes in rat basophil leukemia ( RBL ) cells ( 50 % inhibitory concentration , EC50 , 3 mM ) . Similar concentrations also inhibited the formation of leukotriene C4 ( LTC4 ) by LTC synthetase , a detergent-solubilized cell free particulate enzyme from RBL cells which is capable of coupling P09960 to glutathione . By contrast , the conversion of P09960 to LTC4 using enzymes from rat liver was at least ten times less sensitive to this inhibitor . The EC50 for inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase of RBL cells was directly proportional to the P09960 concentration in the incubations , ranging from 1.5 mM at 10 microM P09960 to over 40 mM at 500 microM P09960 . Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition of the leukotriene C synthetase reaction by diethylcarbamazine was competitive with respect to P09960 . In contrast to diethylcarbamazine , piriprost ( U-60,257 ; 6,9-deepoxy-6,9-(phenylimino)-delta 6,8-prostaglandin I1 ) , which inhibits the formation of sulfidopeptide leuktrienes in RBL cells at the P09917 step ( EC50 5 microM ) , did not inhibit the leukotriene synthetase of these cells . On the other hand , low concentrations of piriprost , which had no demonstrable inhibitory activity on leukotriene formation by themselves , markedly synergized the inhibitory activity of diethylcarbamazine . These results are consistent with the interpretation that both piriprost and diethylcarbamazine inhibit leukotriene formation but that they act on sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway in such a manner as to synergistically interfere with the availability or utilization of P09960 in the leukotriene C synthetase reaction .
