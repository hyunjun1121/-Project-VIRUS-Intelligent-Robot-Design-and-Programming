The receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor amuvatinib ( DB05216 ) sensitizes tumor cells to radio- and chemo-therapies in part by inhibiting homologous recombination . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Q06609 is a key protein involved in homologous recombination ( HR ) and a potential target for radiation- and chemotherapies . Amuvatinib ( formerly known as DB05216 ) is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c- P10721 and PDGFRÎ± and can sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation ( IR ) . Here , we studied amuvatinib mechanism on Q06609 and functional HR . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Protein and RNA analyses , direct repeat green fluorescent protein ( DR-GFP ) assay and polysomal fractioning were used to measure HR efficiency and global translation in amuvatinib-treated H1299 lung carcinoma cells . Synergy of amuvatinib with IR or mitomycin c ( DB00305 ) was assessed by clonogenic survival assay . RESULTS : Amuvaninib inhibited Q06609 protein expression and HR . This was associated with reduced ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and inhibition of global translation . Amuvatinib sensitized cells to IR and DB00305 , agents that are selectively toxic to HR-deficient cells . CONCLUSIONS : Amuvatinib is a promising agent that may be used to decrease tumor cell resistance . Our work suggests that this is associated with decreased Q06609 expression and function and supports the further study of amuvatinib in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
