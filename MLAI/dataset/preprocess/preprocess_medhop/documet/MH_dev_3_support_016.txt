A comparison of the effects of 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment of different behavioural responses to 8-OH-DPAT . The effects of daily pretreatments with the prototypical P08908 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) ( 1.0 mg/kg s.c. ) on behavioural responses to challenge by 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg s.c. ) due to activation of P08908 receptors were determined . The responses had strikingly different susceptibilities to pretreatment . These were not explicable by different effects on pre- and postsynaptic responses . Thus , two components of the 5-HT syndrome due to action at postsynaptic sites ( i.e. flat body posture and reciprocal forepaw treading ) were substantially attenuated 1 day after a single pretreatment with 8-OH.DPAT , but the tail-flick response , though due to action at postsynaptic P08908 sites , was completely unimpaired by 14 pretreatments while the hypothermic response which also probably involves postsynaptic sites showed progressively increased attenuation on 14 pretreatments . 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperphagia which depends on activation of presynaptic sites was unimpaired by the pretreatment schedule . The results are discussed in relation to receptor reserve , second messenger changes and effects at DB01221 receptors . They imply a need for caution in the use of chronic effects of 5-HTergic drugs on specific P08908 receptor-dependent responses as indices of mechanisms for the therapeutic actions of the drugs .
