Effect of olopatadine and other histamine H1 receptor antagonists on the skin inflammation induced by repeated topical application of oxazolone in mice . P35367 antagonists have long been prescribed for atopic dermatitis as an adjuvant therapy with topical therapy by local applied steroids . Olopatadine is one of the second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists that are treated for allergic disorders . We investigated that the effect of olopatadine on oxazolone-induced chronic contact hypersensitivity response in BALB/c mice compared with other histamine H1 receptor antagonists loratadine , cetirizine and fexofenadine . The chronic contact hypersensitivity induced by repeated application of oxazolone was treated with olopatadine and other histamine H1 receptor antagonists at the effective doses on histamine-induced paw edema in mice . The effects of these drugs in the oxazolone-induced model were quantified by measurements of ear swelling , and levels of cytokines in the lesioned ear . Olopatadine significantly inhibited the ear swelling and the increased production of P05112 , IL-1beta , P05231 , GM- P04141 and P01138 in the lesioned ear . On the other hand , the other histamine H1 receptor antagonists did not significantly suppress the increase in ear thickness . Moreover , they did not affect the production of cytokines in the lesioned ear . These results indicate that olopatadine appears to exert additional biological effects besides its blockade of the histamine H1 receptor .
