Resistance to killing by tumor necrosis factor in an adipocyte cell line caused by a defect in arachidonic acid biosynthesis . We have found that Q96RJ0 -R6 , which are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) in the presence of cycloheximide ( Reid , T. R. , Torti , F. , and Ringold , G. M. ( 1989 ) J. Biol. Chem. 264 , 4583-4589 ) , have reduced ability to release arachidonic acid ( 20:4 ) from membrane phospholipids in response to either P01375 or the calcium ionophore A23187 treatment . However , no defect in the activity of phospholipase A2 , the principal enzyme responsible for the release of 20:4 from phospholipids , was observed in these cells . Detailed biochemical characterization of these P01375 -resistant cells has revealed that these cells are unable to synthesize 20:4 endogenously because of a defect in delta 6-desaturase , the rate-limiting enzyme of 20:4 biosynthesis . This deficiency leads to a marked decrease in the steady-state levels of 20:4 present in choline-containing phospholipid ( PC ) and ethanolamine-containing phospholipid ( PE ) . The Q96RJ0 -R6 cells , however , are capable of incorporating exogenous 20:4 into PC and PE , and when loaded in such manner they become significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of P01375 in the presence of cycloheximide . Therefore , the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids appears to be a critical element in the signaling pathway utilized by P01375 and is essential to the rapid cytotoxic response elicited by P01375 in the absence of protein synthesis in wild-type Q96RJ0 cells .
