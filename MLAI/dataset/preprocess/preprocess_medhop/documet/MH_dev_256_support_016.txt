Transient , P41595 receptor-mediated facilitation in neuropathic pain : Up-regulation of PKCγ and engagement of the DB01221 receptor in dorsal horn neurons . Spinal nociception can be facilitated by 5-HT2 receptors in neuropathic pain . We investigated the involvement of glutamate receptors in dorsal neuron hyperexcitation that is promoted by P41595 receptor ( 5-HT2BR ) after spinal nerve ligation ( Q16658 ) in the rat . Augmentation of C-fiber-evoked potentials by spinal superfusion with 5-HT2BR agonist BW 723C86 in nerve-ligated rats was impeded by co-administration of DB01221 receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonist D-AP5 , but not by Q13255 /5 antagonist Q96BJ3 or Q14416 /3 antagonist LY 341495 . Evoked potentials were increased by cis-ACPD in nerve-injured rats , irrespective of simultaneous 5-HT2BR blockade by SB204741 . In uninjured rats , NMDAR agonist cis-ACPD enhanced evoked potentials in the presence of BW 723C86 but not if administered alone or during exposure to protein kinase C γ ( PKCγ ) inhibitor peptide . Triple immunofluorescence labelings revealed co-localization of NMDAR and 5-HT2BR in PKCγ-expressing perikarya in lamina II neurons . As a result of Q16658 , PKCγ was transiently and bilaterally up-regulated in synaptic fraction from dorsal horn homogenates , peaking at day 2 and returning to basal levels by day 9 . Chronic blockade of 5-HT2BR with selective antagonist SB 204741 after Q16658 bilaterally decreased the following : ( i ) PKCγ up-regulation in synaptic fraction , ( ii ) phosphorylation of NMDAR subunit Q9UHB4 ( serine 889 ) in synaptic fraction , and ( iii ) co-localization of both PKCγ and phosphorylated Q9UHB4 with postsynaptic marker P78352 . Chronic delivery of SB 204741 bilaterally attenuated thermal and mechanical allodynia occurring after Q16658 , particularly at day 2 post injury . These findings suggest that transient activation of the PKCγ/NMDAR pathway is critically involved in 5-HT2BR-mediated facilitation in the Q16658 model of neuropathic pain .
