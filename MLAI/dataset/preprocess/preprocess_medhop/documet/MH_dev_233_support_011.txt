Metronomic chemotherapy dosing-schedules with estramustine and temozolomide act synergistically with anti- P35968 antibody to cause inhibition of human umbilical venous endothelial cell growth . The effects of ' metronomic ' or extended chemotherapy dosing schedules ( ECS ) are mediated through poorly understood anti-angiogenic mechanisms . ECS combined with biological anti-angiogenic agents have produced promising pre-clinical results . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We have expanded the list of agents with an in vitro ECS profile to include the methylating agent temozolomide ( DB00853 ) and the anti-mitotic agent estramustine ( Estracyt ) . These agents were also combined with a specific anti-angiogenic inhibitor DB06101 and a non-specific agent with anti-angiogenic properties , Compound 5h . The in vitro HUVEC ECS model system was optimised and cell proliferation assays undertaken . RESULTS : As a single agent , estramustine inhibited endothelial cell proliferation with an IC50 of 4.5 microM and was active at 10-33 % of the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) from clinical schedules , whilst temozolomide had IC50 of 6.6 microM and was active at 1-6 % of MTD . In combination , significant synergy was seen with DB06101 in combination with either drug , whilst modest additive effects were observed with Compound 5h . None of the combinations resulted in significant cytotoxicity or apoptosis . DISCUSSION : The results show that ECS of temozolomide and estramustine can be significantly enhanced when combined with specific anti-angiogenic inhibitors in an in vitro HUVEC system .
