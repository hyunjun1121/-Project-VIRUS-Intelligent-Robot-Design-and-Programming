Characterization of proapoptotic compounds from the bark of Garcinia oblongifolia . Twenty compounds from Garcinia oblongifolia were screened for proapoptotic activity using FRET-based HeLa- P01024 sensor cells . Among them , oblongifolins F and G ( 1 and 2 ) , 1,3,5-trihydroxy-13,13-dimethyl-2H-pyran[7,6-b]xanthone ( 3 ) , nigrolineaxanthone T ( 4 ) , and garcicowin B ( 5 ) showed significant proapoptotic activity at a concentration of 10 μM . Bioassessments were then performed to evaluate the potential of these compounds for therapeutic application . All five compounds showed significant cytotoxicity and caspase-3-activating ability in cervical cancer HeLa cells , with compounds 1 and 2 having the highest potencies . All five compounds specifically induced caspase-dependent apoptosis , which could be prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk . In particular , 3 induced apoptosis through mitotic arrest . Compounds 1-5 displayed similar IC50 values ( 3.9-16.5 μM ) against the three cancer cell lines HeLa , MDA-MB-435 , and HepG2 . In addition , compounds 1 , 2 , and 4 exhibited similar and potent IC50 values ( 2.4-5.1 μM ) against several breast and colon cancer cell lines , including those overexpressing either P04626 or P-glycoprotein . P04626 and P-glycoprotein are known factors that confer resistance to anticancer drugs in cancer cells . This is the first study on the cytotoxicity , caspase-3-activing ability , and specificity of proapoptotic compounds isolated from G. oblongifolia in HeLa cells . The potential application of these compounds against P04626 - or P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cancer cells was investigated .
