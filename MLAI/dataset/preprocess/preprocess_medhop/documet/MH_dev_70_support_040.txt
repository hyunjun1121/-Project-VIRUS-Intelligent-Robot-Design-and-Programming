Development of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines as antimalarials based on inhibition of the S108N and C59R+S108N mutants of dihydrofolate reductase from pyrimethamine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum . The reduced binding of pyrimethamine to Ser108Asn ( S108N ) mutants of parasite dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , which forms the basis of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to pyrimethamine , is largely due to steric constraint imposed by the bulky side chain of N108 on Cl of the 5-p-Cl-phenyl group . This and other S108 mutants with bulky side chains all showed reduced binding to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil . Less effect on binding to some bulky mutants was observed for trimethoprim , with greater flexibility for the 5-substituent . S108N P00374 also binds poorly with other pyrimethamine derivatives with bulky groups in place of the p-Cl , and the binding was generally progressively poorer for the double ( C59R+S108N ) mutant . Removal of the p-Cl or replacement with m-Cl led to better binding with the mutant DHFRs . DB00205 analogues with unbranched hydrophobic 6-substituents showed generally good binding with the mutant DHFRs . A number of compounds were identified with high affinities for both wild-type and mutant DHFRs , with very low to no affinity to human P00374 . Some of these compounds show good antimalarial activities against pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum containing the mutant DHFRs with low cytotoxicity to three mammalian cell lines .
