DB00091 modulates the response to hypoxia-reoxygenation in pulmonary artery endothelial cells . BACKGROUND : Depletion of macrophages , neutrophils , or lymphocytes confers only partial protection against experimental lung reperfusion injury , suggesting that inflammatory responses in other cell types contribute to tissue injury . Endothelial cell activation has previously been shown to be critical to the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury in other vascular beds . Furthermore , cyclosporine ( Q13216 ) reduces in vivo lung reperfusion injury through attenuated secretion of proinflammatory mediators . These studies determined whether pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( PAEC ) , subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation , promote inflammation and whether Q13216 afforded any modulation of that response . METHODS : Isolated rat PAEC were subjected in vitro to 2 hours hypoxia followed by up to 4 hours reoxygenation . Cells were pretreated with Q13216 or a cremaphor vehicle . Differences in activation of signaling kinases and transcription factors were assessed , as was cytokine-chemokine protein secretion . RESULTS : There was significant signaling kinase ( extracellular signal regulated kinase [ P29323 1/2 ] ) activation by 15 minutes reoxygenation , which was temporally associated with marked activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) and early growth response one ( P18146 ) . At 4 hours reoxygenation there were significant increases in chemokine protein secretion . The Q13216 decreased P29323 1/2 phosphorylation and significantly attenuated transcription factor transactivation at 15 minutes reoxygenation . The Q13216 was found to be selective in reducing cytokine-chemokine elaboration at 4 hours reoxygenation . CONCLUSIONS : Hypoxia-reoxygenation induces P29323 1/2 phosphorylation , as well as transactivation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and P18146 in PAEC . DB00091 selectively reduces proinflammatory mediator secretion , likely by transcriptional regulation through NFkappaB and P18146 . This is the first demonstration of P29323 1/2 inhibition afforded by Q13216 .
