Severe malnutrition among young children -- Georgia , January 1997-June 1999 . In October 1999 , the Georgia Department of Human Resources ( GDHR ) was notified of two cases of severe malnutrition in toddlers . Both cases were associated with the use of commercial alternative milk . In response , GDHR and CDC reviewed Georgia hospital records to assess the frequency and cause of hospitalized cases of rickets and protein energy malnutrition ( P15941 ) . The findings of this review indicated that , although no new cases were associated with milk alternatives , three children had P15941 and six had vitamin D deficiency rickets . The children with rickets had been breast fed for approximately 6 months while receiving no vitamin D supplementation . Rickets is preventable through the adequate intake of vitamin D . The American Academy of Pediatrics ( P08697 ) is examining vitamin D supplementation among breast-fed infants .
