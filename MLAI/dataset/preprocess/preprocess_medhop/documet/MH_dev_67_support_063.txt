DB00227 induces the expression of bradykinin type 2 receptors in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells . Cardioprotective bradykinin type-2 receptors ( BK-2Rs ) are downregulated in the myocardial endothelium of both human and rat failing hearts . Statins are cardioprotective drugs that reduce the level of plasma cholesterol but also exert cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects . Here we examined the effect of lovastatin on BK-2R expression in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells . The effect of lovastatin on the expression of BK receptors in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) was examined by real-time PCR , Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry . DB00227 induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in both BK-2R and BK-1R mRNA expression in the cultured HCAECs . Also , the number of functional BK-2Rs capable of inducing BK-mediated NO production and cGMP signaling was increased in the lovastatin-treated HCAECs . Mevalonate , the direct metabolite of P04035 , reversed the effect of lovastatin . Furthermore , lovastatin inhibited Rho activation and a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases , Y-27632 , induced a similar increase in BK-2R expression as lovastatin . In contrast , a specific inhibitor of P35354 , NS398 , significantly inhibited the lovastatin-induced expression of BK-2Rs . Here we show for the first time that lovastatin induces the expression of BK-2Rs in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells through a novel cholesterol-independent pleiotropic mechanism that involves RhoA kinase inhibition and P35354 activation . Thus , reported beneficial effects of statins in cardiovascular diseases may be partly mediated by an increased expression of cardioprotective BK-2Rs in the endothelial cells of the coronary tree . Moreover , the use of P35354 inhibitors may affect the level of endothelial BK-2Rs in a negative fashion .
