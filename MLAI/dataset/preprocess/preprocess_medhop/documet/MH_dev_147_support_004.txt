Therapy with interferon-beta modulates endogenous catecholamines in lymphocytes of patients with multiple sclerosis . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the endogenous dopaminergic/adrenergic system of lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients during treatment with interferon ( IFN ) -beta . METHODS : Patients with relapsing-remitting MS undergoing IFN-beta treatment were prospectively studied during the first year of treatment . Circulating lymphocytes were obtained at baseline and after 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months of treatment and assayed for catecholamine ( CA ) production and mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH , the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of CA ) , beta(2)-adrenoceptors ( AR ) and D2 , D3 and D5 dopaminergic receptors ( DR ) . RESULTS : In cells from patients treated with IFN-beta for 12 months the production of CA hugely increased and was less sensitive to P01579 -induced inhibition . Expression of mRNA for TH , beta(2)-AR and P21918 was already enhanced after 1 month and further increased up to 6-12 months of treatment . On the contrary , P14416 mRNA progressively decreased and P35462 mRNA did not significantly change over the whole study period . CONCLUSIONS : In MS patients IFN-beta treatment enhances the ability of lymphocytes to produce CA , and induces extensive modifications of both beta(2)-AR and DR-operated pathways . The clinical relevance of these effects deserves consideration .
