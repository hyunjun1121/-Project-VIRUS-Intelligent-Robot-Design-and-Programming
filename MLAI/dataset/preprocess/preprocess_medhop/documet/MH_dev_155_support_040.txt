Developmental changes of glutamate receptors in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus . We studied the immunohistochemical localization of the glutamate receptors ( P42261 , -2 , and -3 , ) in the developing rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus using antibodies to GluR1 and to an epitope common to GluR2 and GluR3 ( GluR2/3 ) subunits . In the cerebral cortex , GluR1 immunoreactivity appeared in the neurons from postnatal day ( P01160 ) 0 , increased with maturation , was highest at P01160 10 , decreased until P01160 30 , and thereafter remained at the same level as on P01160 0 . GluR2/3 immunoreactivity appeared earlier in scattered neurons on embryonal day ( ED ) 18 , increased with maturation and reached a peak between P01160 10 and P01160 15 , after which the immunoreactivity gradually decreased and reached a plateau at P01160 30 . For both GluR1 and GluR2/3 , some of the pyramidal neurons showed intense staining . In the pyramidal layers of the hippocampus , GluR1 and GluR2/3 immunoreactivity was found in all the pyramidal neurons of the P00915 -4 area from ED 20 . In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus , GluR1 and GluR2/3 immunoreactivity was found in the neurons of the granule cells after P01160 0 . Immunoreactivity in the neurons of the subiculum was found after P01160 5 and that of the polymorphic cell layers was found after P01160 15-20 . Our results indicate that the development of glutamate receptor subunits in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus is expressed in different spatial patterns and distinct temporal patterns throughout development and is scheduled during the early postnatal period , when synaptic plasticity or synaptic connection occurs in these regions .
