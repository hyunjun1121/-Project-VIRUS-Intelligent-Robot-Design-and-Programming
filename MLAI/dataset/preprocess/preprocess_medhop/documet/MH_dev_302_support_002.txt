Phenotypic rescue of a Drosophila model of mitochondrial P12235 disease . A point mutation in the Drosophila gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase ( ANT ) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [ stress-sensitive B(1) ( sesB(1) ) ] . We characterized the organismal , bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of sesB(1) flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype . In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures , sesB(1) flies have an impaired response to sound , defective male courtship , female sterility and curtailed lifespan . These phenotypes , excluding the latter two , are shared with the mitoribosomal protein P28222 mutant , tko(25t) . Mitochondria from sesB(1) adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase . sesB(1) adults exhibited DB00171 depletion , lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis , characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways . Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis , and their eggs , although fertilized , failed to develop to the larval stages . The sesB(1) phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background . Female sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase ( Q15067 ) from the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis , whereas Q15067 did not alleviate developmental delay . Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases , based on alleviating metabolic stress .
