P01375 alpha blockade reduces the synovial cell infiltrate early after initiation of treatment , but apparently not by induction of apoptosis in synovial tissue . OBJECTIVE : To determine whether treatment with the chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody infliximab could reduce cellularity by the induction of apoptosis in synovial tissue . METHODS : Twenty-four rheumatoid arthritis patients with active disease were randomized to receive either infliximab ( 3 mg/kg ) ( n = 12 ) or placebo ( n = 12 ) intravenously . All patients were subjected to arthroscopic synovial biopsy directly before initiation of treatment . A second arthroscopic synovial biopsy of the same index joint was performed 48 hours after the first arthroscopy . After the second arthroscopy , the patients who had initially received placebo were also treated with infliximab in an extension study . A third arthroscopy was performed in all patients on day 28 . Immunohistologic analysis was performed to characterize the cell infiltrate . In situ detection of apoptotic cells was performed by TUNEL assay and electron microscopy . RESULTS : At 48 hours after initiation of infliximab treatment , there was a significant reduction in the number of intimal macrophages ; this was not observed in the placebo group . The number of sublining macrophages , T cells , and plasma cells also tended to be decreased in infliximab-treated patients , but not in the placebo group . Of interest , we did not detect any increase in the number of apoptotic cells after infliximab treatment . CONCLUSION : DB00065 therapy may reduce the number of inflammatory cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue as soon as 48 hours after initiation of treatment , but apparently not by induction of apoptosis . Conceivably , decreased cell infiltration primarily results from early inhibition of cell migration .
