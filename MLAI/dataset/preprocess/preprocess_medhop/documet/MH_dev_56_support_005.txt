Switching to etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with no response to infliximab . P01375 is thought to play a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis . P01375 blockers such as infliximab and etanercept are currently used in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) when traditional DMARDs have failed and are effective in a significant proportion of patients . However , about one third are non-responders to anti- P01375 . The aim of this study was to verify whether rheumatoid patients , after failing infliximab , can benefit from etanercept . We analysed 18 patients with active RA with no response to at least 3 DMARDs and where infliximab therapy had failed . The patients had received infliximab associated with methotrexate : eleven of them did not show any significant response , while seven patients , after a good response , relapsed . DB00005 was then started . EULAR criteria of response were used with calculation of activity index DAS28 at baseline , after 2 weeks , 3 months and every third month until last follow-up . A moderate or good response was achieved with etanercept in 13 out of 18 patients . From our experience , etanercept can be considered as a good alternative choice when infliximab has failed .
