DB00472 -induced proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells isolated from rat postnatal cerebellum . Previous studies have shown that the serotonin-reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine affects neural progenitors derived from postnatal cerebellum or adult hippocampus and stimulates their proliferation . In the human cerebellum , the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells ( CGC ) continues until the 11th postnatal month and could be influenced in infants by breastfeeding-delivered SSRIs . Current information about fluoxetine effects on postnatal cerebellar neural progenitors is limited . Here we report the characterization of fluoxetine actions on rat postnatal cerebellar neural progenitors . RT-PCR and immunostaining revealed the expression of serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) , 5HT(1A) receptors , tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) , and serotonin ( 5HT ) . Protracted in vitro fluoxetine treatment increased cell proliferation and differentiation . The proliferative effects of fluoxetine , 5HT , and the selective agonist of 5HT(1A) receptors trans-8-hydroxy-2-(N-n-propyl-N-3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)aminotetralin ( 8-OH-PIPAT ) were abolished by the selective antagonist of 5HT(1A) receptors , N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride ( WAY-100635 ) . Furthermore , fluoxetine-induced activation of both the DB02527 -response element-binding ( CREB ) protein and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ( P27361 /2 ) , which was abolished by the selective inhibitor of Q96HU1 kinase kinase ( MEK ) 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene ( U0126 ) , and increased cyclin D1 expression . All these effects were prevented by WAY-100635 . Collectively , our results demonstrate that rat postnatal cerebellum contains neural progenitors capable of proliferating and differentiating in response to fluoxetine exposure , possibly through the activation of 5HT(1A) receptors . The relevance of these findings for possible SSRI effects on the developing postnatal/infant human cerebellum should be explored .
