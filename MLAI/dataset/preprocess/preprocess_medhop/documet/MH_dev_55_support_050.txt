Pro- P08253 activation by the PPARgamma agonist , ciglitazone , induces cell invasion through the generation of ROS and the activation of P29323 . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor modulating a variety of biological functions including cancer cell proliferation and differentiation . However , the role of PPARgamma and its ligands in tumor invasion is unclear . To evaluate a possible role for PPARgamma ligands in tumor invasion , we examined whether PPARgamma agonists including pioglitazone , troglitazone , rosiglitazone , and ciglitazone could affect the activity of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) in the HT1080 cell line , a well-studied and well-characterized cell line for MMP research . The gelatin zymography assay showed that ciglitazone activated pro- P08253 significantly . In addition , ciglitazone increased the expression of P08253 , which was accompanied by an increase of membrane type 1-MMP ( P50281 ) expression . The PPARgamma antagonist , GW9662 attenuated the ciglitazone-induced PPARgamma activation but it did not affect the pro- P08253 activation by ciglitazone , suggesting that the action of ciglitazone on the pro- P08253 activation bypassed the PPARgamma pathway . Antioxidants and various inhibitors of signal transduction were used to investigate the mechanism of ciglitazone-induced pro- P08253 activation . We found that the sustained production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was required for pro- P08253 activation by ciglitazone . We also found that PB98059 , an inhibitor of MEK- P29323 , significantly blocked ciglitazone-induced pro- P08253 activation and that extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) was hyperphosphorylated by ciglitazone . Moreover , cell invasion was significantly increased by ciglitazone in the HT1080 cell lines , whereas cell motility was not affected . This study suggests that ciglitazone-induced pro- P08253 activation increases PPARgamma-independent tumor cell invasion through ROS production and P29323 activation in some types of cancer cells .
