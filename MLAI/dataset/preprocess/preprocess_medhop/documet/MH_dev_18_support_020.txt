Inhibition of functional HER family members increases the sensitivity to docetaxel in human ovarian cancer cell lines . Human epidermal growth factor ( HER ) family-targeted therapy combined with standard cytotoxic agents might improve the treatment of ovarian cancer . Human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 , IGROV-1 , and SKOV-3 with differential P00533 , P04626 , and P21860 expression levels were used to study whether P00533 -directed ( cetuximab ) or P04626 -directed ( trastuzumab , pertuzumab ) monoclonal antibodies inhibited cell growth and abrogated activated receptor signaling routes . Possible increase of antiproliferative effects and further activation of caspase-3 as a read-out for apoptosis were analyzed when monoclonal antibodies were combined with docetaxel . Cetuximab alone inhibited cell growth in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , which was more pronounced when combined with pertuzumab in OVCAR-3 . SKOV-3 cell growth was not significantly affected by any of the antibodies . Cetuximab increased the 50 % growth-inhibiting effects of docetaxel in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , but not in SKOV-3 . Coaddition of pertuzumab to cetuximab plus docetaxel in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , and , to a lesser extent trastuzumab in OVCAR-3 , inhibited cell growth even further . P42574 activation by docetaxel was enhanced after addition of cetuximab in OVCAR-3 and after addition of cetuximab plus pertuzumab in IGROV-1 and SKOV-3 . Functional P00533 -signaling , P04626 -signaling , and P21860 -signaling routes as shown from abrogation of P01133 -stimulated and heregulin-stimulated phosphorylated P27361 /2 by cetuximab , trastuzumab , and pertuzumab , respectively , were shown in OVCAR-3 and IGROV-1 , but hardly in SKOV-3 . DB06366 was able to abrogate phosphorylated P04626 by P01133 and heregulin , except in SKOV-3 . In conclusion , a combination of docetaxel with inhibitors of HER family members , such as cetuximab plus pertuzumab , may be considered for a clinical trial in ovarian carcinomas with functional receptors .
