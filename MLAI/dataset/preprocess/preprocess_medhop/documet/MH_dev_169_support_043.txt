Neonatal platelets are less reactive than adult platelets to physiological agonists in whole blood . Previous studies have reported that the platelets of healthy term neonates have either diminished or normal reactivity compared to the platelets of adults . To circumvent the methodologic problems of previous studies , we used a whole blood flow cytometric method to study neonatal platelet reactivity to thrombin , a combination of ADP and epinephrine , and U46619 ( a stable thromboxane A2 analogue ) . Inclusion in the assay of the peptide GPRP ( an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization ) enabled us to study platelet reactivity to human alpha-thrombin in whole blood . Umbilical cord blood and day 1 peripheral blood were collected from 30 healthy term neonates and compared to peripheral blood from 20 normal adults . In whole blood samples without added agonist , there were no significant differences between neonates and adults in the platelet binding of monoclonal antibodies 6D1 ( GPIb-specific ) or DB00054 ( P08514 -IIIa complex-specific ) . As determined by P28222 ( a P16109 -specific monoclonal antibody ) , neither neonates nor adults had circulating degranulated platelets . However , in both cord and peripheral whole blood samples , neonatal platelets were significantly less reactive than adult platelets to thrombin , ADP/epinephrine , and U46619 , as determined by the extent of increase in the platelet surface expression of P16109 and the P08514 -IIIa complex , and the extent of decrease in the platelet surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex.
