P01138 deprivation-induced gene expression : after ten years , where do we stand ? Nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) is required for the survival of developing sympathetic and sensory neurons . In the absence of P01138 , these neurons undergo protein synthesis-dependent apoptosis . Ten years have gone by since the first reports of specific genes being upregulated during P01138 deprivation-induced cell death . Over the last decade , a few additional genes ( DP5 , Bim , Q9GZT9 ) have been added to a list that began with cyclin D1 and c-jun . In this chapter , we discuss the evidence that these genes act as regulators of neuronal cell death . We also suggest a hypothesis for how one gene , Q9GZT9 , may function to suppress a self-protection mechanism in P01138 -deprived neurons .
