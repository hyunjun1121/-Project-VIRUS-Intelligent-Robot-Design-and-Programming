Oxidative stress and DNA hypermethylation status in renal cell carcinoma arising in patients on dialysis . Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) is more frequently observed in patients on dialysis than in patients with normal renal function . However , the mechanism underlying carcinogenesis in RCC patients on dialysis is still unclear . We hypothesized that oxidative stress affects patients on dialysis and generates new neoplasms , and therefore analysed the correlation between the influences of various markers of oxidative stress and carcinogenesis in those patients . We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of oxidative stress markers , such as P35228 , 8-OHdG , and P35354 in 42 cases on dialysis and 51 cases with normal renal function as a control . The methylation status of p16INK4a , Q8N726 , P40337 , and RASSF1A was analysed together with clinicopathological factors . Histologically , the papillary type was observed more frequently in dialysis RCC than in sporadic RCC . Immunohistochemically , overexpression of P35228 ( p < 0.0001 ) and P35354 ( p = 0.0002 ) was more frequently observed in dialysis RCC . Furthermore , the 8-OHdG labelling index was significantly higher in dialysis RCC than in sporadic RCC . Hypermethylation of p16INK4a was more frequently found in dialysis RCC ( p < 0.05 ) . However , no significant correlations between oxidative stress markers and DNA hypermethylation status were observed . The overexpression of P35228 , P35354 , and 8-OHdG in dialysis RCC suggests that patients on dialysis are affected by oxidative stress and that this effect plays an important role in the genesis of dialysis RCC .
