Evolution of subterranean diving beetles ( Coleoptera : Dytiscidae : Hydroporini , Bidessini ) in the arid zone of Australia . Calcrete aquifers in arid inland Australia have recently been found to contain the world 's most diverse assemblage of subterranean diving beetles ( Coleoptera : Dytiscidae ) . In this study we test whether the adaptive shift hypothesis ( ASH ) or the climatic relict hypothesis ( P06850 ) is the most likely mode of evolution for the Australian subterranean diving beetles by using a phylogeny based on two sequenced fragments of mitochondrial genes ( CO1 and 16S-tRNA- P03886 ) and linearized using a relaxed molecular clock method . Most individual calcrete aquifers contain an assemblage of diving beetle species of distantly related lineages and/or a single pair of sister species that significantly differ in size and morphology . Evolutionary transitions from surface to subterranean life took place in a relatively small time frame between nine and four million years ago . Most of the variation in divergence times of the sympatric sister species is explained by the variation in latitude of the localities , which correlates with the onset of aridity from the north to the south and with an aridity maximum in the Early Pliocene ( five mya ) . We conclude that individual calcrete aquifers were colonized by several distantly related diving beetle lineages . Several lines of evidence from molecular clock analyses support the P06850 , indicating that all evolutionary transitions took place during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene as a result of aridification .
