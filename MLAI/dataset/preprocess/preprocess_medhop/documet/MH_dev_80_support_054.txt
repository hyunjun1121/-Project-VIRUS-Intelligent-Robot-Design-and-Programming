Update on immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer . BACKGROUND : The immune checkpoint proteins , including the P33681 / P10747 receptor superfamily , have become increasingly important targets for pharmacologic blockade . Several classes of new agents have impressive clinical activity , and their eventual approval for treatment of lung cancer seems likely . METHODS : This article discusses the current development of these agents , including the P16410 , P18621 , and Q9NZQ7 inhibitory pathways , killer immunoglobulin receptor ( P55040 ) inhibition , and other checkpoint proteins . RESULTS : DB06186 in combination with chemotherapy has exhibited encouraging results in small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer alike . Reported phase I trials of the monoclonal antibodies nivolumab , MK-3475 , MEDI4736 , and MPDL3280A are demonstrating durable overall radiological response rates in the 20 % to 25 % range in lung cancer . This exceptional activity includes squamous lung cancers , a population historically bereft of significant therapeutic advances . Retrospective examination of tumor Q9NZQ7 expression suggests that Q9NZQ7 may eventually be evaluable as a predictive biomarker . Dual checkpoint blockade strategies , such as those combining anti- P16410 , anti- P18627 , or anti- P55040 , are being tested to increase the proportion and durability of tumor responses . Examination of acquired immune resistance and post-immunotherapy relapse strategies are underway . CONCLUSIONS : These emerging antibodies hold great potential for the systemic control of epithelial cancers such as lung cancer .
