Induction of prostacyclin/ DB01240 synthase expression after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion . DB01240 ( DB01240 ) , a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and leukocyte activation , is crucial in vascular diseases such as stroke . Q16647 ( PGIS ) is the key enzyme for DB01240 synthesis . Although expression of PGIS was noted in the brain , its role in ischemic insult remains unclear . Here we reported the temporal and spatial expression of PGIS mRNA and protein after 60-min transient ischemia . Northern blot and in situ hybridization revealed a delayed increase of PGIS mRNA in the ischemic cortex at 24- to 72-h after ischemia ; PGIS was detected mainly in the ipsilateral penumbra area , pyriform cortex , hippocampus , and leptomeninges . Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PGIS proteins were expressed temporally and spatially similar to PGIS mRNA . PGIS was heavily colocalized with P16284 to endothelial cells at the leptomeninges , large and small vessels , and localized to neuronal cells , largely at the penumbra area . A substantial amount of PGIS was also detected in the macrophage and glial cells . To evaluate its role against ischemic infarct , we overexpressed PGIS by adenoviral gene transfer . When infused 72 h before ischemia ( - 72 h ) , Adv-PGIS reduced infarct volume by approximately 50 % . However , it had no effect on infarct volume when infused immediately after ischemia ( 0 h ) . Eicosanoid analysis revealed selective elevation of DB01240 at - 72 h while DB01240 and TXB2 were both elevated at 0 h , altering the DB01240 /thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) ratio from 10 to 4 . These findings indicate that PGIS protects the brain by enhancing DB01240 synthesis and creating a favorable DB01240 /TXA2 ratio .
