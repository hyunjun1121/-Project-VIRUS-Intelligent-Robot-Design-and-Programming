Antidiabetic sulfonylurea enhances secretagogue-induced adrenocorticotropin secretion and proopiomelanocortin gene expression in vitro . The presence of high-affinity binding sites for antidiabetic sulfonylureas ( SUs ) and the expression of SU receptor ( Q09428 ) messenger RNA in the adenohypophyseal cells have recently been reported . In this study , we examined the effects of SU on P01189 gene expression and DB01285 secretion using the AtT20PL cell line , a subclone of AtT20 in which the rat P01189 5'-promoter-luciferase fusion gene was stably incorporated . A representative SU glibenclamide inhibited the basal P01189 5'-promoter activity . In contrast , glibenclamide enhanced forskolin- or P06850 -induced P01189 expression in a dose-dependent manner . Interestingly , the latter effect was not observed under treatment with DB07954 , a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor . Furthermore , diazoxide , an opener of the DB00171 -sensitive K+ channel , only antagonized the suppressive effect of glibenclamide . Lastly , RT-PCR analysis showed that mouse Q09428 ( but not SUR2 ) messenger RNA was expressed in this cell line . These results suggest that , in AtT20PL cells , SU has dual effects , i.e. a suppressive effect on basal P01189 expression through diazoxide-sensitive ( DB00171 -sensitive ) K+-channel-mediated mechanism , and an enhancing effect on DB02527 /protein kinase A-stimulated P01189 expression through a different mechanism ( probably mediated by phosphodiesterase ) . To our knowledge , this is the first report showing the effect of SU on the expression of the anterior pituitary hormone gene .
