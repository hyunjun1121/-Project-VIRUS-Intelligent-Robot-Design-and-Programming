P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in late stage clinical trials . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a cell membrane receptor that plays a key role in cancer development and progression . Ligand-activated P00533 -dependent signalling is involved in cell proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis and metastatic spread . Targeting the P00533 , therefore , represents a promising molecular approach in cancer treatment . Several anti- P00533 agents are in clinical development . Three drugs are currently in Phase II and III development as single agents , or in combination with other anticancer modalities : IMC-225 ( cetuximab/Erbitux ; ImClone ) , a chimaeric human-mouse monoclonal IgG(1) antibody , which blocks ligand binding and functional activation of the P00533 ; DB00530 ( erlotinib/Tarceva ; Genentech/OSI/Roch ) and ZD1839 ( gefitinib/ DB00317 ; AstraZeneca ) , two small molecule P00533 -selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity , which prevent P00533 autophosphorylation and activation . DB00317 is the first P00533 -targeting agent to be registered as an anticancer drug in Japan , in Australia and in the US for the third-line treatment of chemoresistant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients . This review will focus on the preclinical background and on the results from the first series of clinical trials with these drugs . Furthermore , continuing clinical trials and a series of open clinical issues for the development of optimal strategies of using P00533 -targeting agents will be discussed .
