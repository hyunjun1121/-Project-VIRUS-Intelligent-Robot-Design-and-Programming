DB06212 , a selective oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist , ameliorates podocyte injury in puromycin aminonucleoside nephrotic rats . BACKGROUND : Proteinuria caused by glomerular disease is characterized by podocyte injury . P30518 antagonists are effective in reducing albuminuria , although their actions on glomerular podocytes have not been explored . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of tolvaptan , a selective oral V2 receptor antagonist , on podocytes in a puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) -induced nephrosis rat model . METHODS : Rats were allocated to a control , PAN nephrosis , or tolvaptan-treated PAN nephrosis group ( n = 9 per group ) . Urinary protein excretion and serum levels of total protein , albumin , creatinine , and total cholesterol were measured on day 10 . The influence of tolvaptan on podocytes was examined in renal tissues by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy . RESULTS : PAN induced massive proteinuria and serum creatinine elevation on day 10 , both of which were significantly ameliorated by tolvaptan . Immunofluorescence studies of the podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and podocin revealed granular staining patterns in PAN nephrosis rats . In tolvaptan-treated rats , nephrin and podocin expressions retained their normal linear pattern . Electron microscopy showed foot process effacement was ameliorated in tolvaptan-treated rats . CONCLUSIONS : DB06212 is protective against podocyte damage and proteinuria in PAN nephrosis . This study indicates that tolvaptan exerts a renoprotective effect by affecting podocyte morphology and probably function in PAN nephrosis . DB06212 is a promising pharmacological tool in the treatment of renal edema .
