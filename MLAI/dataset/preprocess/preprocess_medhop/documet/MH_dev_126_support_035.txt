Biologically targeted treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer : focus on epidermal growth factor receptor . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) has emerged in recent years as a key target of molecular therapy for solid tumors . The postembryonic role of P00533 is normally limited . In cancer , however , abnormal P00533 -tyrosine kinase ( TK ) activity plays a central role in many of the processes involved in tumor progression , such as proliferation , angiogenesis , invasiveness , decreased apoptosis , and loss of differentiation . Several different approaches have been taken to inhibit P00533 -mediated activity in tumor cells , including monoclonal antibodies directed at the ligand-binding portion of the P00533 and small-molecule agents that directly inhibit the intracellular TK domain of P00533 . Two of these TK inhibitors , gefitinib and erlotinib ( DB00530 , Tarceva ) , have shown antitumor activity and good tolerability across several tumor types in early dose-finding clinical trials , particularly for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . In heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC , gefitinib showed clinically significant tumor responses and symptom relief with good tolerability . Based on these results , gefitinib has now been approved for the third-line treatment of advanced NSCLC . The use of gefitinib in standard treatment programs or combined with other molecular targeted agents may substantially improve the outlook for patients with NSCLC or other types of solid tumors
