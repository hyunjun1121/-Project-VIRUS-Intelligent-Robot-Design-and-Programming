Integration of Q96HU1 kinase signal transduction pathways at the serum response element . The ternary complex factor ( TCF ) subfamily of ETS-domain transcription factors bind with serum response factor ( P11831 ) to the serum response element ( SRE ) and mediate increased gene expression . The TCF protein Elk-1 is phosphorylated by the JNK and P29323 groups of mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases causing increased DNA binding , ternary complex formation , and transcriptional activation . Activated SRE-dependent gene expression is induced by JNK in cells treated with interleukin-1 and by P29323 after treatment with phorbol ester . The Elk-1 transcription factor therefore integrates Q96HU1 kinase signaling pathways in vivo to coordinate biological responses to different extracellular stimuli .
