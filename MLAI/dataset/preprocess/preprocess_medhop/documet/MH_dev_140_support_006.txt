DB00435 and superoxide inhibit platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphotyrosine phosphatases . Platelet derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) became tyrosine autophosphorylated in rat mesangial cells shortly after platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ligation in a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( tyrphostin AG 1296 ) sensitive manner . Ligand-independent , massive tyrosine P09619 phosphorylation was achieved by diverse NO releasing compounds . Phosphorylation was slow compared to PDGF , revealed a concentration- and time-dependency , and was not mimicked by lipophilic cyclic-GMP analogues . P01584 / DB02527 activated mesangial cells released NO and in turn showed P09619 phosphorylation . A NO-synthase involvement was assured by L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester inhibition . P09619 phosphorylation was also achieved by the redox cycler 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone . NO- and O2(.-)-evoked PGDFR phosphorylation was DB06151 reversible . Cell free dephosphorylation assays revealed P09619 dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases . Receptor dephosphorylation by cytosolic phosphatases was completed within 30 min and was sensitive to the readdition of NO donors or orthovanadate . In addition , phosphatase activity determined in a direct dephosphorylation assay using the substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate was attenuated by NO or vanadate . We conclude that cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatases are targeted by exogenously supplied or endogenously generated NO in mesangial cells . Radical ( NO. or O2.- ) formation shifts the phosphorylation -- dephosphorylation equilibrium towards phosphorylation , thus integrating redox-mediated responses into established signal transducing pathways .
