Q96EB6 deacetylase promotes acquisition of genetic mutations for drug resistance in CML cells . P11274 - P00519 transforms bone marrow progenitor cells and promotes genome instability , leading to development of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib effectively treats CML , but acquired resistance can develop because of P11274 - P00519 mutations . Mechanisms for acquisition of P11274 - P00519 mutations are not fully understood . Using a novel culture model of CML acquired resistance , we show that inhibition of Q96EB6 deacetylase by small molecule inhibitors or gene knockdown blocks acquisition of P11274 - P00519 mutations and relapse of CML cells on tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Q96EB6 knockdown also suppresses de novo genetic mutations of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase gene in CML and non-CML cells upon treatment with DNA damaging agent camptothecin . Although Q96EB6 can enhance cellular DNA damage response , it alters functions of DNA repair machineries in CML cells and stimulates activity of error-prone DNA damage repair , in association with acquisition of genetic mutations . These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of Q96EB6 for promoting mutation acquisition in cancer , and have implication for targeting Q96EB6 to overcome CML drug resistance .
