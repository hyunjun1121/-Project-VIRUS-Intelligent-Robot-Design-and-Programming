Essential erbB family phosphorylation in osteosarcoma as a target for DB05424 inhibition . BACKGROUND : The role of erbB tyrosine kinases , especially Her-2 , in osteosarcoma has engendered intense debate . Some investigators identified an association between low-level Her-2 expression , compared to none , and poor patient outcome . Others questioned the importance of apparent cytoplasmic expression of Her-2 , since membranous overexpression is associated with poor outcome in carcinomas . We previously demonstrated that primary osteosarcoma cells express cell-surface P00533 and Her-2 , with the p80 isoform of Her-4 localized to the nucleus . We wished to determine if erbB kinases in osteosarcoma were phosphorylated , and if this was required for growth . PROCEDURES : We cultured early passage osteosarcoma cell lines in the presence or absence of the pan-erbB inhibitor DB05424 and examined the phosphorylation status of P00533 , Her-2 , and Her-4 by immunohistochemistry , cell-based ELISA , flow cytometry and two dimensional Western blot . We also assessed the impact of DB05424 upon osteosarcoma growth and survival in vitro . RESULTS : P00533 , Her-2 , and Her-4 were constitutively phosphorylated in early passage osteosarcoma cells cultured in vitro . DB05424 abrogated erbB receptor phosphorylation and caused growth inhibition and apoptosis in a titratible fashion with concentrations of 1 muM or more . CONCLUSIONS : P00533 , Her-2 , and Her-4 are constitutively phosphorylated in early passage osteosarcoma cells in tissue culture , and erbB signaling provides essential growth and anti-apoptotic signals to osteosarcoma cells . This suggests that erbB overexpression is not required for erbB to promote malignancy , but rather that overexpression is one of several mechanisms that generate unregulated erbB signaling .
