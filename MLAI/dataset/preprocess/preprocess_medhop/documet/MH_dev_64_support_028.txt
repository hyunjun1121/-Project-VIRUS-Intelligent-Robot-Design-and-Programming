The role of afatinib in the management of non-small cell lung carcinoma . INTRODUCTION : Despite initial patient benefit , drug resistance to first-generation P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) is inevitable . One of the key mechanisms responsible for the development of acquired drug resistance is the secondary T790M missense mutation in exon 20 of the P00533 kinase domain . DB08916 is an DB00171 -competitive small molecule inhibitor that potently and irreversibly inhibits P00533 and mutated P00533 including the T790M variant , as well as other members of the ErbB family in preclinical studies . AREAS COVERED : The authors describe the rationale and provide the preclinical background to afatinib and its potential as a NSCLC therapy . Specifically , the authors detail the drug 's pharmaco-kinetic profile and review its clinical efficacy and toxicity profile . EXPERT OPINION : DB08916 is an effective treatment option for therapy-naive advanced NSCLC harboring an activating P00533 mutation . Furthermore , it is also of potential benefit to patients with acquired resistance to P00533 kinase inhibitors . In the future , the authors envision the clinical development of third-generation P00533 mutation-specific inhibitors in NSCLC , which may potentially spare normal tissue toxicity . Nevertheless , afatinib currently represents a bona fide treatment option in the NSCLC therapeutic armamentarium .
