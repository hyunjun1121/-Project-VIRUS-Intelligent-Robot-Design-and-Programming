DB00175 -induced changes in receptor-mediated metabolism of low density lipoprotein in guinea pigs . The effect of pravastatin , an inhibitor of P04035 , on the metabolism of human low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) was examined in guinea pigs . DB00175 treatment significantly reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by 15.6 mg/dl ( 38.8 % ) and 12.7 mg/dl ( 42.9 % ) , respectively . We investigated the metabolism of LDL in pravastatin-treated and untreated guinea pigs using the simultaneous intravenous injection of 131I-labeled LDL and 125I-labeled , galactose-treated LDL to quantify the P01130 pathway . DB00175 increased the fractional catabolic rate ( FCR ) of the P01130 -dependent pathway . The treatment with pravastatin did not alter the FCR of the P01130 -independent pathway . The FCR of the P01130 -dependent pathway was higher for LDL isolated from pravastatin-treated subjects than for LDL isolated from control subjects . These findings suggest that pravastatin mainly reduced plasma cholesterol levels by accelerated FCR of the P01130 -mediated pathway .
