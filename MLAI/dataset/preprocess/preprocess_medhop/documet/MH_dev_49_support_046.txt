P06401 activation of extranuclear signaling pathways in regulating p53 expression in vascular endothelial cells . We previously showed that progesterone ( P4 ) inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) through a p53-dependent pathway . Now we investigated further the molecular mechanism underlying the hormone activity . In cultured HUVECs , P4 increased the protein levels of phosphorylated Src ( p-Src ) , P04049 , and P29323 . The levels of p-Src and p-Src-progesterone receptor complex in HUVECs were increased by P4 treatment . These effects were blocked by pretreatment with a progesterone receptor antagonist , DB00834 . The P4-induced increase in p53 transactivity was abolished by pretreatment with Src kinase inhibitors . Moreover , administration with cSrc antisense oligonucleotide prevented the P4-induced increases of the levels of p53 mRNA and protein . These data suggest that P4-induced up-regulation of p53 might be mediated through activation of cSrc . Pretreatment with Src kinase inhibitors also prevented P4-induced membrane translocation of Kras and increases of the protein levels of phosphorylated Raf and phosphorylated P29323 . Transfection with dominant-negative P28482 prevented the P4-induced increases of protein level and promoter activity of p53 and a decrease of thymidine incorporation . P4 also increased nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) nuclear translocation and NF-κB binding onto the p53 promoter . These effects were abolished by pretreatment with P29323 inhibitors . The P4-induced up-regulation of the p53 promoter activity was prevented by preadministration with dominant-negative P28482 or NF-κB inhibitors . Taken together , our data suggest that the cSrc/Kras/ P04049 / P28482 /NF-κB signaling pathway contributes to the P4-induced up-regulation of p53 in HUVECs . These findings highlight progesterone receptor activation of extranuclear signaling pathways in regulating p53 and cell cycle progression in HUVECs .
