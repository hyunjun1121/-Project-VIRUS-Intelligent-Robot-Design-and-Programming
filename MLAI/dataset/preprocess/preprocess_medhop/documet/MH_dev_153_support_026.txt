Exenatide blocks P23458 - P42224 in pancreatic beta cells . Exenatide ( Ex-4 ) is an antidiabetic drug that acts through the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and has recently been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus . Ex-4 also has been shown to affect beta cell gene expression and increase beta cell mass in rodent models of type 1 diabetes mellitus , but the mechanisms are not fully understood . We therefore analyzed the pathways affected by Ex-4 in human islets by using oligonucleotide microarrays and the PathwayStudio software ( Ariadne Genomics , Rockville , MD ) . We identified the P23458 - P42224 pathway as a novel target of Ex-4 and confirmed the Ex-4-mediated down-regulation of P23458 and P42224 by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in human islets and P01308 -1 cells . P23458 - P42224 is the major signaling pathway mediating the interferon gamma effects on beta cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes mellitus . Thus , these findings suggest that Ex-4 treatment may also be beneficial in type 1 diabetes mellitus , where it may help protect beta cells from cytokine-induced cell death by inhibiting P23458 - P42224 .
