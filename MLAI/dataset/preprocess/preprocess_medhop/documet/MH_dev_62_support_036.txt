The use of P01375 blocking agents in rheumatoid arthritis : an overview . P01375 has been found to play a pivotal role in the pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The overexpression of P01375 in RA synovium , the data from in vitro synovial cell cultures with the use of anti- P01375 antibody and the results from P01375 blockade in animal models of arthritis argued for the importance of this cytokine in RA . Drugs targeting P01375 have been developed to neutralise the deleterious effects of this inflammatory cytokine . There are currently three drugs available in the treatment of RA patients with active disease , which was refractory to conventional treatments including methotrexate , infliximab ( a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody ) , etanercept ( a fusion protein combining 2 p75 P01375 receptors with a Fc fragment of human IgG ( 1 ) ) and adalimumab ( a fully human monoclonal antibody ) . These three drugs have proved to be effective and safe in appropriate and well conducted clinical trials and showed effectiveness in slowing and even arresting the progression of radiographic damage . With the long-term surveillance of these drugs serious adverse events were described , particularly intracellular organism infections such as tuberculosis . Other drugs targeting P01375 are in development and include monoclonal antibody ( CDP571 ) , pegylated molecules ( DB08904 and PEG-r-Hu-sTNF-RI ) or soluble p55 P01375 receptor construct ( lenercept ) . These new biological therapies blocking P01375 undoubtedly constitute a considerable advance in the management of RA , but careful evaluation at the initiation of the treatment and long-term surveillance of the patients receiving such drugs remains necessary .
