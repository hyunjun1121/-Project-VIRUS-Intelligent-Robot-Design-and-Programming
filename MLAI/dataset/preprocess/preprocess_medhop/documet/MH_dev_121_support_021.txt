Arm-cranking exercise assisted by Functional Electrical Stimulation in P13671 tetraplegia : a pilot study . Tetraplegic volunteers undertook progressive exercise training , using novel systems for arm-cranking exercise assisted by Functional Electrical Stimulation ( P07332 ) . The main aim was to determine potential training effects of P07332 -assisted arm-crank ergometry ( P07332 - P12821 ) on upper limb strength and cardiopulmonary ( fitness ) in tetraplegia . Surface P07332 was applied to the biceps and triceps during exercise on an instrumented ergometer . Two tetraplegic volunteers with P13671 Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) went through muscle strengthening , baseline exercise testing and three months of progressive P07332 - P12821 training . Repeat exercise tests were carried out every four weeks during training , and post-training , to monitor upper-limb strength and cardiopulmonary fitness . At each test point , an incremental test was carried out to determine peak work rate , peak oxygen uptake , gas exchange threshold and oxygen uptake-work rate relationship during P07332 - P12821 . Peak oxygen uptake for Subject A increased from 0.7 l/min to 1.1 l/min , and peak power output increased from 7 W to 38 W after P07332 - P12821 training . For Subject B , peak oxygen uptake was unchanged , but peak power output increased from 3 W to 8 W . These case studies illustrate potential benefits of P07332 - P12821 in tetraplegia , but also the differences in exercise responses between individuals .
