DB04868 : a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative with activity against P11274 - P00519 , P10721 and P09619 kinases . The P11274 - P00519 kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is currently the standard therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . However , mutations within the P00519 kinase domain interfering with drug binding have been identified as the main mechanism of resistance to imatinib . Multiple distinct P11274 - P00519 kinase mutant isoforms conferring varying degrees of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been reported . DB04868 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 30-fold more potent than imatinib against P11274 - P00519 kinase . DB04868 is active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant P11274 - P00519 mutant isoforms , except for T315I . Results from Phase II studies of nilotinib for patients with CML after failure or intolerance to imatinib therapy have shown a favorable toxicity profile and confirmed the high efficacy of nilotinib in this setting . Studies addressing the activity of nilotinib in newly-diagnosed patients with CML are underway . Furthermore , nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of P10721 and P09619 kinases . Here , we review the preclinical development of nilotinib and the activity of this agent in patients with CML and in tumors driven by P10721 and/or P09619 mutant kinases , such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and some forms of clonal hypereosinophilia .
