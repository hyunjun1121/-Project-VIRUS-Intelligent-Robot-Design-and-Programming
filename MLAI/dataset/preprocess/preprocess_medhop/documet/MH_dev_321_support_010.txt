DB01599 alleviates atherosclerosis and improves high density lipoprotein function . BACKGROUND : DB01599 is a unique hypolipidemic agent that decreases high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . However , it is not definite that whether probucol hinders the progression of atherosclerosis by improving HDL function . METHODS : Eighteen New Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into the control , atherosclerosis and probucol groups . Control group were fed a regular diet ; the atherosclerosis group received a high fat diet , and the probucol group received the high fat diet plus probucol . Hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages were isolated for [ (3)H ] labeled cholesterol efflux rates and expression of O95477 and SR-B1 at gene and protein levels ; venous blood was collected for serum paraoxonase 1 , myeloperoxidase activity and lipid analysis . Aorta were prepared for morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis after 12 weeks . RESULTS : Compared to the atherosclerosis group , the paraoxonase 1 activity , cholesterol efflux rates , expression of O95477 and Q8WTV0 in hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages , and the level of O95477 and Q8WTV0 in aortic lesions were remarkably improved in the probucol group , But the serum HDL cholesterol concentration , myeloperoxidase activity , the IMT and the percentage plaque area of aorta were significantly decreased . CONCLUSION : DB01599 alleviated atherosclerosis by improving HDL function . The mechanisms include accelerating the process of reverse cholesterol transport , improving the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant functions .
