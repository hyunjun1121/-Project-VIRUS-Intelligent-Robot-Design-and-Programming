Pharmacophore definition and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship study on structurally diverse prostacyclin receptor agonists . DB01240 is an endogenous mediator that shows potent platelet inhibitory activity and powerful relaxation of peripheral resistance vessels . P43119 agonists are valuable drugs in the treatment of various vascular diseases spanning primary pulmonary hypertension to Raynaud 's syndrome . Although agonists from various structural classes were synthesized , a common pharmacophore was never defined . Therefore , an attempt was made to integrate the different agonists into a single model . A dataset of structurally diverse prostacyclin receptor agonists was tested for its affinity to the human platelet prostacyclin receptor . The dataset included prostanoid and nonprostanoid ligands comprising iloprost , cicaprost , and BMY45778 . Extensive conformational analyses were performed for both classes of compounds because of the absence of rigid templates . The search and superimposition procedure yielded a pharmacophore that aligns the essential carboxylate group of the agonists as well as demonstrates that different functional groups in prostanoid and nonprostanoid agonists can be arranged in a uniform conformation . A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship study was performed using the programs O75791 and GOLPE . This analysis yielded a cross-validated correlation coefficient of 0.77 . With this model , it is possible to predict the affinity of untested compounds .
