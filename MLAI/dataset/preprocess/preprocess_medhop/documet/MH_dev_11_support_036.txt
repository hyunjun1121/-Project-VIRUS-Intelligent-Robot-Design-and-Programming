Expression of cytosolic retinoid-binding protein genes in human skin biopsies and cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts . Using reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction we have studied the mRNA expression of serum retinol-binding protein and cytosolic receptors for retinol and retinoic acid in skin biopsies , and in cultured epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts . Transcripts for cellular retinol-binding protein ( P09455 ) I and cellular retinoic-acid-binding protein ( CRABP ) I were found in normal skin , keratinocytes , and fibroblasts . CRABP II transcripts were detected in skin and keratinocytes . A decreased mRNA expression of CRABP I and an increased mRNA expression of CRABP II were found in lesional psoriatic skin compared with uninvolved skin . mRNA transcripts for serum retinol-binding protein ( s- P02753 ) were detected in all tissues and cells . The biological importance of s- P02753 expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts is not known , but hypothetically this protein may be involved in the intracellular shuttling of retinol and retinoic acid , or in the retransportation of cellular retinoids into the extracellular space .
