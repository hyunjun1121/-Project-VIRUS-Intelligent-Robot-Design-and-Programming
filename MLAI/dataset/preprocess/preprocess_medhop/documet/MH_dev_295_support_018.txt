Potential opposite roles of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) pathway in autism spectrum and bipolar disorders . Signal transduction from the synapse to the nucleus subsequently involves transient increases in synaptic Ca2+ , activation of P62158 kinases , activation of the GTPase Ras , activation of the P29323 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , and finally GSK3 inhibition and CREB-activation . Genetic studies in autism have identified mutations and copy number variations in a number of genes involved in this synapse to nucleus signaling path . In particular , a gain of function mutation in the Q13936 gene , deletions and disruption of the Q96PV0 gene , a copy number variation encompassing the P27361 gene and a duplication of P62258 indicate that in a subset of autism patients the P29323 cascade is inappropriately activated . Predicted functional consequences of this hyperactivation would be an increase in complexity of the dendritic tree , and via inhibition of GSK3 , a delayed circadian phase . The latter effect indeed fits the frequent sleep disturbances observed in autistic patients . Interestingly , the sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder patients are frequently characterized as phase advanced . A selective evaluation of genetic mutations in bipolar patients indicates that the activity of the P29323 cascade , at least in a subset of patients , presumably is hypoactive . Thus , with respect to the P29323 pathway , autism and bipolar disorder seem each other 's counter pole .
