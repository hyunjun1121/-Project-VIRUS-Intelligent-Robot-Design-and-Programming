DB01590 -treated renal transplant recipients have a more robust CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell response compared with cyclosporine- or mycophenolate-treated patients . BACKGROUND : In renal transplant recipients , mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitors have been reported to protect against cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease . Here , we questioned whether P42345 inhibitors specifically influence human CMV-induced T-cell responses . METHODS : We studied renal transplant recipients treated with prednisolone , cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , and mycophenolate sodium ( MPS ) for the first 6 months after transplantation followed by double therapy consisting of prednisolone/everolimus , which is an P42345 inhibitor ( P/ Q9UI08 ; n=10 ) , prednisolone/ DB00091 ( P/ DB00091 ; n=7 ) , or prednisolone/MPS ( P/MPS ; n=9 ) . All patients were CMV-IgG positive before transplantation . CMV reactivation was detectable in the first 6 months after transplantation and not thereafter . None of the patients included in this study suffered from CMV disease . Both CD27CD8 and CD27CD28CD4 effector-type T-cell counts , known to be associated with CMV infection , were measured before transplantation and at 6 and 24 months after transplantation . Additionally , we determined both number and function of CMV-specific CD8 T cells at these time points . RESULTS : The number of total CD8 T cells , CD27CD8 T cells , and CD28CD4 T cells increased significantly after switch to therapy with P/ Q9UI08 but not after switch to P/ DB00091 or P/MPS . Specifically , CMV-specific CD8 T-cell counts significantly increased after switch to therapy with P/ Q9UI08 . Furthermore , the P42345 inhibitor sirolimus strongly inhibited alloresponses in vitro , whereas it did not affect CMV-specific responses . CONCLUSION : We observed a significant increase in ( CMV-specific ) effector-type CD8 and P01730 T-cell counts in everolimus-treated patients . These findings may at least in part explain the reported low incidence of CMV-related pathology in everolimus-treated patients .
