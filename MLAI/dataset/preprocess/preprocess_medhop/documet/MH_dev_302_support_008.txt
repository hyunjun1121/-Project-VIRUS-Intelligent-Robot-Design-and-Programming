Modulation of a number of genes on personality traits in a sample of healthy subjects . A large number of studies investigated the genetic modulation of personality with mixed results . As a confirmatory analysis of previous findings , we firstly examined the association between several previously examined single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and personality traits in a sample of 158 healthy subjects . As a secondary aim , we tested the potential modulation of additional never previously investigated genes on personality . A blood sample was collected and the Temperament and Character Inventory ( TCI ) has been administered to all participants . Multivariate analysis of covariance , controlling for sex and age , was used to test SNP influence on TCI scores . Examination of previously studied gene variants showed an effect of adrenergic alpha 2B receptor ( P18089 ) on Cooperativeness and of serotonin receptor P28223 on Self Directedness . Examination of new variants revealed that sex hormone binding protein ( P04278 ) was associated with reward dependence . Moreover , several additional variants showed a tendency towards association with some TCI traits , confirming previous results . This study suggests that P18089 , P28223 and P04278 genes may be involved in the modulation of personality in healthy subjects . The major limitation of this study was the small sample size .
