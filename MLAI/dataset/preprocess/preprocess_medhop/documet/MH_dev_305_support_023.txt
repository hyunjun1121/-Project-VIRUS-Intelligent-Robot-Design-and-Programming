Rheb protein binds CAD ( carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 , aspartate transcarbamoylase , and dihydroorotase ) protein in a GTP- and effector domain-dependent manner and influences its cellular localization and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase ( CPSase ) activity . Rheb small GTPases , which consist of Rheb1 and Q8TAI7 ( also known as RhebL1 ) in mammalian cells , are unique members of the Ras superfamily and play central roles in regulating protein synthesis and cell growth by activating P42345 . To gain further insight into the function of Rheb , we carried out a search for Rheb-binding proteins and found that Rheb binds to P27708 ( carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 , aspartate transcarbamoylase , and dihydroorotase ) , a multifunctional enzyme required for the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides . CAD binding is more pronounced with Q8TAI7 than with Rheb1 . Rheb binds CAD in a GTP- and effector domain-dependent manner . The region of CAD where Rheb binds is located at the C-terminal region of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase domain and not in the dihydroorotase and aspartate transcarbamoylase domains . Rheb stimulated carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity of CAD in vitro . In addition , an elevated level of intracellular UTP pyrimidine nucleotide was observed in Tsc2-deficient cells , which was attenuated by knocking down of Rheb . Immunostaining analysis showed that expression of Rheb leads to increased accumulation of CAD on lysosomes . Both a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that blocks membrane association of Rheb and knockdown of Rheb mislocalized CAD . These results establish CAD as a downstream effector of Rheb and suggest a possible role of Rheb in regulating de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis .
