DB06699 . DB06699 is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptor antagonist that , in common with P30968 agonists ( e.g. leuprolide , goserelin and triptorelin ) , is indicated for use as an androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer . In 1-year , randomized , open-label , phase II or III trials in patients with all stages of prostate cancer , subcutaneous degarelix was associated with rapid , profound and sustained suppression of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , without evidence of testosterone surges or microsurges . In the phase III trial , degarelix ( 240 mg initially followed by 80 mg every 28 days ) was considered to be effective and noninferior to intramuscular leuprolide ( 7.5 mg every 28 days ) with regard to inducing and maintaining suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels ( i.e. < or=0.5 ng/mL ) . DB06699 induced testosterone suppression more rapidly than leuprolide . Median serum testosterone levels of < or=0.5 ng/mL were achieved by day 3 in degarelix recipients , but not until day 28 in leuprolide recipients . PSA suppression was also more rapid with degarelix than with leuprolide , with significant between-group differences in serum PSA levels favouring degarelix at 14 and 28 days . DB06699 treatment for 1 year was generally well tolerated ; the adverse events reported were mostly related to subcutaneous drug administration ( i.e. injection-site reactions ) and hormonal androgen deprivation ( e.g. hot flushes ) .
