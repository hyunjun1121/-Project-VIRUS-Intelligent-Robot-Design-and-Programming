20-hydroxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid mediates endothelial dysfunction via O15111 -dependent endothelial nitric-oxide synthase uncoupling . Endothelial dysfunction and activation occur in the vasculature and are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases . We have shown that 20-hydroxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid ( 20-HETE ) , a cytochrome P450 4A-derived eicosanoid that promotes vasoconstriction in the microcirculation , uncouples endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and reduces nitric oxide ( NO ) levels via the dissociation of the 90-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP90 ) from P29474 . It also causes endothelial activation by stimulating nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and increasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines . In this study , we examined signaling mechanisms that may link 20-HETE-induced endothelial dysfunction and activation . Under conditions in which 20-HETE inhibited NO production , it also stimulated inhibitor of NF-kappaB ( IkappaB ) phosphorylation . Both effects were prevented by inhibition of tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) /extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) . It is noteworthy that inhibitor of O15111 ( IKK ) activity negated the 20-HETE-mediated inhibition of NO production . Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that treatment of ionophore-stimulated cells with 20-HETE brings about a decrease in HSP90- P29474 association and an increase in HSP90-IKKbeta association , suggesting that the activation by 20-HETE of NF-kappaB is linked to its action on P29474 . Furthermore , addition of inhibitors of tyrosine kinase MAPK and IKK restored the 20-HETE-mediated impairment of acetylcholine-induced relaxation in rat renal interlobar arteries . The results indicate that 20-HETE mediates P29474 uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction via the activation of tyrosine kinase , MAPK , and IKK , and these effects are linked to 20-HETE-mediated endothelial activation .
