Modulation of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side effects by medications for mood disorders . Antipsychotic drugs are widely used not only for schizophrenia , but also for mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression . To evaluate the interactions between antipsychotics and drugs for mood disorders in modulating extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) , we examined the effects of antidepressants and mood-stabilizing drugs on haloperidol ( P42357 ) -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy in mice and rats . The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , fluoxetine and paroxetine , and the tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) clomipramine , which showed no EPS by themselves , significantly potentiated P42357 -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy in a dose-dependent manner . In contrast , the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA ) mirtazapine failed to augment , but rather attenuated P42357 -induced bradykinesia and catalepsy . DB06148 also tended to reduce the EPS induction . In addition , neither treatment with lithium , sodium valproate nor carbamazepine potentiated P42357 -induced EPS . Furthermore , treatment of animals with ritanserin ( 5- Q13049 /2C antagonist ) , ondansetron ( 5- Q9H205 antagonist ) , and SB-258585 ( P50406 antagonist ) significantly antagonized the EPS augmentation by fluoxetine . Intrastriatal injection of ritanserin or SB-258585 , but not ondansetron , also attenuated the EPS induction . The present study suggests that NaSSAs are superior to SSRIs or TCAs in combined therapy for mood disorders with antipsychotics in terms of EPS induction . In addition , 5- Q13049 /2C , 5- Q9H205 and P50406 receptors seem to be responsible for the augmentation of antipsychotic-induced EPS by serotonin reuptake inhibitors .
