Blockade of P30556 reduces oxidative stress in adipose tissue and ameliorates adipocytokine dysregulation . Dysregulated production of adipocytokines may be involved in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associated with metabolic syndrome . The aim of this study was to determine the effects of treatment with angiotensin II ( Ang II ) type-1 receptor blocker ( ARB ) on the regulation of adipocytokines . DB00275 , an ARB , significantly blunted the age- and body weight-associated falls in plasma adiponectin both in genetically and diet-induced obese mice , without affecting body weight , but had no effect on plasma adiponectin levels in lean mice . DB00275 also ameliorated dysregulation of adipocytokines in obesity , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and serum amyloid A3 . DB00275 significantly reduced reactive oxygen species originating from accumulated fat and attenuated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phospho hydrogenase oxidase subunits in adipose tissue . In cultured adipocytes , olmesartan acted as an antioxidant and improved adipocytokine dysregulation . Our results indicate that blockade of Ang II receptor ameliorates adipocytokine dysregulation and that such action is mediated , at least in part , by targeting oxidative stress in obese adipose tissue . Ang II signaling and subsequent oxidative stress in adipose tissue may be potential targets for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in metabolic syndrome and also in metabolic syndrome-based CKD .
