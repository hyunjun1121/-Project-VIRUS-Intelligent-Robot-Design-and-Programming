The sulphydryl containing P12821 inhibitor Zofenoprilat protects coronary endothelium from Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis . Pediatric and adult cancer patients , following the use of the antitumor drug Doxorubicin develop cardiotoxicity . Pharmacological protection of microvascular endothelium might produce a double benefit : ( i ) reduction of myocardial toxicity ( the primary target of Doxorubicin action ) and ( ii ) maintenance of the vascular functionality for the adequate delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells . This study was aimed to evaluate the mechanisms responsible of the protective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) Zofenoprilat against the toxic effects exerted by Doxorubicin on coronary microvascular endothelium . We found that exposure of endothelial cells to Doxorubicin ( 0.1-1Î¼M range ) impaired cell survival by promoting their apoptosis . P27361 /2 related p53 activation , but not reactive oxygen species , was responsible for Doxorubicin induced caspase-3 cleavage . P04637 mediated-apoptosis and impairment of survival were reverted by treatment with Zofenoprilat . The previously described PI-3K/ P29474 /endogenous fibroblast growth factor signaling was not involved in the protective effect , which , instead , could be ascribed to cystathionine gamma lyase dependent availability of H2S from Zofenoprilat . Furthermore , considering the tumor environment , the treatment of endothelial/tumor co-cultures with Zofenoprilat did not affect the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin . In conclusion the ACEI Zofenoprilat exerts a protective effect on Doxorubicin induced endothelial damage , without affecting its antitumor efficacy . Thus , sulfhydryl containing ACEI may be a useful therapy for Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity .
