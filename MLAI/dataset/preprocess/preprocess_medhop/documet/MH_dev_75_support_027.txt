Two types of prostacyclin receptor coupling to stimulation of adenylate cyclase and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in a cultured mast cell line , BNu-2cl3 cells . DB01240 ( DB01240 ) -mediated signal transduction was examined in interleukin 3 ( P08700 ) -dependent BNu-2cl3 mast cells . DB01088 , a stable DB01240 analogue , induced the accumulation of intracellular DB02527 and IP3 , and an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration . Pretreatment of the cells with a protein kinase C activator , 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate , suppressed the iloprost-induced IP3 accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization , but inversely potentiated the DB02527 accumulation , suggesting that neither of these signal transduction pathways of iloprosts is the result of a secondary effect of activation of the other . Removal of P08700 from the culture medium reduced the iloprost-induced IP3 accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization , while it had no effect on the iloprost-induced DB02527 accumulation at all . These results taken together suggest that BNu-2cl3 cells express two types of P43119 ; one couples to stimulation of adenylate cyclase , its expression being independent of P08700 , while the other couples to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis , its expression being dependent on P08700 .
