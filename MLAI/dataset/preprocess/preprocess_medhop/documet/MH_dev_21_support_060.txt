Expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in human articular chondrocytes : association with caveolin and beta 1-integrin . The urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) in concert with other proteolytic enzymes plays a critical role in cartilage degradation during osteoarthritis . DB00013 receptor ( Q03405 ) , a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein present on the cell surface of various cell types such as cancer cells , fibroblasts , synoviocytes , and chondrocytes , is a key regulator of the plasmin-mediated pericellular proteolysis . Recently , in arthritic synovial tissue increased Q03405 expression has been detected . By immunohistochemical analysis we observed , in addition , enhanced expression of Q03405 in chondrocytes of arthritic samples of human cartilage compared to non-arthritic controls . Using in vitro cultured human chondrocytes , we analyzed whether Q03405 is associated with structural proteins , which are known to be involved in cell signaling and activation . Q03405 in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated chondrocytes colocalized with caveolin as well as beta 1-integrin , as demonstrated by double immunostaining with specific antibodies . Furthermore , Q03405 was present in caveolae-like structures of chondrocytes as detected by immunoelectron microscopy . Finally , both caveolin and beta 1-integrin were coprecipitated with Q03405 -specific antibodies from cell extracts suggesting that these proteins may form functional complexes in human chondrocytes . The localization of Q03405 in caveolae and its close association with caveolin and beta 1-integrin points to a significance of Q03405 -mediated signaling pathways in human chondrocytes .
