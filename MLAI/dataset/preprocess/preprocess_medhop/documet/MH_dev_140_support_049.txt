P00747 /plasmin regulates c-fos and egr-1 expression via the MEK/ P29323 pathway . In this study , we showed that plasminogen ( Plg ) and plasmin ( Pla ) bind to lysine-binding sites on cell surface and trigger a signaling pathway that activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) MEK and P27361 /2 , which in turn leads to the expression of the primary response genes c-fos and early growth response gene egr-1 . Our data show that the Plg/Pla-stimulated steady-state mRNA levels of both genes reached a maximum by 30 min and then returned to basal levels by 1h . The gene induction was sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of MEK . Leupeptin , a serine protease inhibitor , suppressed Pla but not Plg-induced c-fos and egr-1 expression , emphasizing the role played by the serine protease activity associated with Pla . Pre-incubation with cholera toxin completely blocked the Plg/Pla-induced gene expression , suggesting that another signaling pathway , which recruits G protein-coupled receptors , may also be involved . Furthermore , Plg/Pla also stimulated AP-1 and P18146 DNA-binding activities , which were abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of MEK . Altogether , these results suggest that Plg/Pla stimulates c-fos and egr-1 expression via activation of the MEK/ P29323 pathway .
