Corticospinal tract conduction block results in the prolongation of central motor conduction time in compressive cervical myelopathy . OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to analyze corticospinal function in patients with compressive cervical myelopathy and to elucidate the mechanism underlying its prolonged central motor conduction time ( CMCT ) . METHODS : Motor evoked potentials following transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) and peripheral conduction time in the ulnar and tibial nerves following electrical stimulation were measured from the abductor digiti minimi ( P35318 ) and abductor hallucis ( AH ) muscles in 24 patients with compressive cervical myelopathy and used to calculate CMCT . Spinal cord evoked potentials ( SCEPs ) following transcranial electric stimulation were recorded intraoperatively from the P06681 -3 to P13671 -7 intervertebral levels . Correlations between prolonged CMCT and SCEP values were then estimated . RESULTS : The shorter/longer CMCT between the patients ' right and left P35318 and AH were 8.5+/-2.9/11.5+/-3.3 and 16.2+/-3.1/18.4+/-3.3 ms , respectively ( mean+/-SD ) . The SCEPs amplitude at P13671 -7 , compared to P06681 -3 , was 25.7+/-21.0 % . The attenuation of SCEP amplitude , but not latency , at P13671 -7 correlated significantly with CMCT prolongation . CONCLUSIONS : Our data support the view that CMCT prolongation is primarily due to corticospinal conduction block , rather than conduction delay . SIGNIFICANCE : Insight was provided into the mechanism of corticospinal dysfunction in compressive cervical myelopathy .
