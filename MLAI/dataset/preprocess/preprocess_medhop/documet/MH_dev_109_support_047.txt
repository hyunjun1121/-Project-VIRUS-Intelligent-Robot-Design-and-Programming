Opposed effects of lithium on the MEK- P29323 pathway in neural cells : inhibition in astrocytes and stimulation in neurons by GSK3 independent mechanisms . DB01356 is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder , but despite its proven therapeutic efficacy , the molecular mechanisms of action are not fully understood . The present study was undertaken to explore lithium effects of the MEK/ P29323 cascade of protein kinases in astrocytes and neurons . In asynchronously proliferating rat cortical astrocytes , lithium decreased time- and dose-dependently the phosphorylation of MEK and P29323 , with 1 mM concentrations achieving 60 and 50 % inhibition of P29323 and MEK , respectively , after a 7-day exposure . DB01356 also inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest . In serum-deprived , quiescent astrocytes , pre-exposure to lithium resulted in the inhibition of cell cycle re-entry as stimulated by the mitogen endothelin-1 : under this experimental setting , lithium did not affect the rapid , peak phosphorylation of MEK taking place after 3-5 min , but was effective in inhibiting the long-term , sustained phosphorylation of MEK . DB01356 inhibition of the astrocyte MEK/ P29323 pathway was independent of inositol depletion . Further , compound SB216763 inhibited Tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and stabilized cytosolic beta-catenin , consistent with the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta ( P49841 ) , but failed to reproduce lithium effects on MEK and P29323 phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest . In cerebellar granule neurons , millimolar concentrations of lithium enhanced MEK and P29323 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner , again through an inositol and P49841 independent mechanism . These opposing effects in astrocytes and neurons make lithium treatment a promising strategy to favour neural repair and reduce reactive gliosis after traumatic injury .
