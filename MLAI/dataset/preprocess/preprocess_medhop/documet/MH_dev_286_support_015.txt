Phosphorylation of thymidylate synthase from various sources by human protein kinase CK2 and its catalytic subunits . P04818 ( TS ) was found to be a substrate for both catalytic subunits of human CK2 , with phosphorylation by CK2alpha and CK2alpha ' characterized by similar K(m) values , 4.6microM and 4.2microM , respectively , but different efficiencies , the apparent turnover number with CK2alpha being 10-fold higher . With both catalytic subunits , phosphorylation of human TS , like calmodulin and P55957 , was strongly inhibited in the presence of the regulatory subunit CK2beta , the holoenzyme being activated by polylysine . Phosphorylation of recombinant human , rat , mouse and Trichinella spiralis TSs proteins was compared , with the human enzyme being apparently a much better substrate than the others . Following hydrolysis and TLC , phosphoserine was detected in human and rat , and phosphotyrosine in T. spiralis , TS , used as substrates for CK2alpha . MALDI-TOF MS analysis led to identification of phosphorylated DB00133 (124) in human TS , within a sequence LGFS(124)TREEGD , atypical for a CK2 substrate recognition site . The phosphorylation site is located in a region considered important for the catalytic mechanism or regulation of human TS , corresponding to the loop 107-128 . Following phosphorylation by CK2alpha , resulting in incorporation of 0.4mol of phosphate per mol of dimeric TS , human TS exhibits unaltered K(m) values for DB03800 and N(5,10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate , but a 50 % lower turnover number , pointing to a strong influence of DB00133 (124) phosphorylation on its catalytic efficiency .
