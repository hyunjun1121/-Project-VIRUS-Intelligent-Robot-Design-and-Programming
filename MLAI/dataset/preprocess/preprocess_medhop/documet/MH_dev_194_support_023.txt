Oxidative stress and inflammatory response evoked by transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion : effects of the Q07869 agonist WY14643 . This study investigated the effects of the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( Q07869 ) agonist WY14643 on ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury in the rat hippocampus . Transient cerebral ischemia ( 30 min ) , followed by 1-24 h reperfusion , significantly increased the generation of reactive oxygen species , nitric oxide ( NO ) , and lipid peroxidation end-products , as well as markedly reducing levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione . Reperfusion for 3-6 h led to increased expression of the proteins heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) . Pretreatment with WY14643 suppressed oxidative stress and expression of P09601 , P35228 , and P05362 , but had no effect on P35354 . These effects are due to suppression of the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB . The Q07869 antagonist MK886 abolished the beneficial effects of WY14643 . The levels of P04271 protein , a marker of cerebral injury used in stroke trials to monitor injury , were high in the hippocampus of rats exposed to I/R , but markedly reduced by WY14643 . We propose that WY14643 protects the brain against excessive oxidative stress and inflammation and may thus be useful in treating stroke .
