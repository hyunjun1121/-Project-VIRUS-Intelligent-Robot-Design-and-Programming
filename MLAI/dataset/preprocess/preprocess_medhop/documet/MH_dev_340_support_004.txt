Proinflammatory cytokines promote glial heme oxygenase-1 expression and mitochondrial iron deposition : implications for multiple sclerosis . Proinflammatory cytokines , pathological iron deposition , and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) . P09601 mRNA levels and mitochondrial uptake of [(55)Fe]Cl(3)-derived iron were measured in rat astroglial cultures exposed to interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) alone or in combination with the heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) inhibitors , tin mesoporphyrin ( DB04912 ) or dexamthasone ( DEX ) , or interferon beta1b ( P27352 -beta ) . P09601 expression in astrocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of spinal cord tissue derived from MS and control subjects . IL-1beta or P01375 promoted sequestration of non-transferrin-derived (55)Fe by astroglial mitochondria . P09601 inhibitors , mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( P55157 ) blockers and antioxidants significantly attenuated cytokine-related mitochondrial iron sequestration in these cells . IFN-beta decreased P09601 expression and mitochondrial iron sequestration in IL-1beta- and P01375 -challenged astroglia . The percentage of astrocytes coexpressing P09601 in affected spinal cord from MS patients ( 57.3 % +/- 12.8 % ) was significantly greater ( p < 0.05 ) than in normal spinal cord derived from controls subjects ( 15.4 % +/- 8.4 % ) . P09601 is over-expressed in MS spinal cord astroglia and may promote mitochondrial iron deposition in MS plaques . In MS , IFN-beta may attenuate glial P09601 gene induction and aberrant mitochondrial iron deposition accruing from exposure to proinflammatory cytokines .
