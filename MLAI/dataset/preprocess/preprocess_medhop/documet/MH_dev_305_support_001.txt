Human lipopolysaccharide-binding protein ( P18428 ) and P08571 independently deliver triacylated lipoproteins to Q15399 ( Q15399 ) and O60603 and enhance formation of the ternary signaling complex . Bacterial lipoproteins are the most potent microbial agonists for the O60603 ( O60603 ) subfamily , and this pattern recognition event induces cellular activation , leading to host immune responses . Triacylated bacterial lipoproteins coordinately bind Q15399 and O60603 , resulting in a stable ternary complex that drives intracellular signaling . The sensitivity of TLR-expressing cells to lipoproteins is greatly enhanced by two lipid-binding serum proteins known as lipopolysaccharide-binding protein ( P18428 ) and soluble P08571 ( sCD14 ) ; however , the physical mechanism that underlies this increased sensitivity is not known . To address this , we measured the ability of P18428 and sCD14 to drive ternary complex formation between soluble extracellular domains of Q15399 and O60603 and a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide agonist . Importantly , addition of substoichiometric amounts of either P18428 or sCD14 significantly enhanced formation of a TLR1Â· O60603 lipopeptide ternary complex as measured by size exclusion chromatography . However , neither P18428 nor sCD14 was physically associated with the final ternary complex . Similar results were obtained using outer surface protein A ( OspA ) , a naturally occurring triacylated lipoprotein agonist from Borrelia burgdorferi . Activation studies revealed that either P18428 or sCD14 sensitized TLR-expressing cells to nanogram levels of either the synthetic lipopeptide or DB00045 agonist . Together , our results show that either P18428 or sCD14 can drive ternary complex formation and TLR activation by acting as mobile carriers of triacylated lipopeptides or lipoproteins .
