[ Cyfra 21-1 new marker for non-small cell lung cancer ] . The aim of the study is to estimate the new tumor marker CYFRA 21-1 in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients and comparison of this results with SCC-Ag . The investigation was carried out on 115 NSCLC patients ( 55 with squamous cell , 35 with adenocarcinoma , 25 with large cell ) qualified for surgical treatment and in 48 nonmalignant lung diseases patients . CYFRA 21-1 was determined by the means of IRMA method ( Q9NSE2 bio international -- GIF- Q09428 -Yvette , France ) and SCC-Ag -- MEIA method ( IMx system Abbott ) . Elevated levels of CYFRA 21-1 were obtained in 48.7 % and SCC-Ag in Q04695 % . Elevated levels of examined markers most frequently occurred in squamous cell type ( SCC ) . It was found out that CYFRA 21-1 dependent on : a ) SCC stage ( I-40 % , II-61.1 % , III-85.2 % ) , b ) tumor size ( T1-38.4 % , P24752 -73.1 % , DB00279 -87.5 % ) , c ) mediastinal lymph nodes metastases ( No and N1-53.8 % and N2-86.9 % ) . Similar correlations were not observed in SCC-Ag examination . Simultaneous determination of CYFRA 21-1 and SCC-Ag showed minimal sensitivity increase from 48.7 % to 52.1 % in NSCLC and from 69.1 % to 70.1 % in SCC and decrease of specificity from 95.8 % to 85.4 % . To sum up , determination of CYFRA 21-1 in NSCLC patients ( especially in SCC patients ) is useful in diagnosis and clinical stage determination .
