P10275 -mediated antagonism of estrogen-dependent low density lipoprotein receptor transcription in cultured hepatocytes . Postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than women who do not receive hormone treatment . Multiple mechanisms are likely to underlie estrogen 's cardioprotective action , including lowering of plasma low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol . Using an in vitro system exhibiting normal regulation of P01130 ( P01130 ) gene transcription , we show that 17beta-estradiol activates the P01130 promoter in transiently transfected HepG2 cells . P01130 activation by estrogen in HepG2 cells is dependent on the presence of exogenous estrogen receptor , and the estrogen-responsive region of the P01130 promoter colocalizes with the sterol response element previously identified . The estrogen response is concentration dependent , saturable , and sensitive to antagonism by estrogen receptor antagonists . Further , we show that compounds with androgen receptor agonist activity attenuate the estrogen-induced up-regulation of P01130 in our model system . Progestins with androgen receptor agonist activity , such as medroxyprogesterone acetate , also suppress estrogen 's effects on P01130 expression through their androgenic properties . Characterization of the interplay between these hormone receptors on the P01130 in vitro system may allow a better understanding of the actions of sex steroids on P01130 gene expression and their roles in cardiovascular disease .
