A potent peptidomimetic inhibitor of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A has a very different conformation than P60880 substrate . Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A is the most lethal of all known toxins . Here , we report the crystal structure , along with SAR data , of the zinc metalloprotease domain of DB00083 bound to a potent peptidomimetic inhibitor ( K(i)=41 nM ) that resembles the local sequence of the P60880 substrate . Surprisingly , the inhibitor adopts a helical conformation around the cleavage site , in contrast to the extended conformation of the native substrate . The backbone of the inhibitor 's P1 residue displaces the putative catalytic water molecule and concomitantly interacts with the " proton shuttle " E224 . This mechanism of inhibition is aided by residue contacts in the conserved S1 ' pocket of the substrate binding cleft and by the induction of new hydrophobic pockets , which are not present in the apo form , especially for the P2 ' residue of the inhibitor . Our inhibitor is specific for DB00083 as it does not inhibit other BoNT serotypes or thermolysin .
