Progressive changes in the leukemogenic signaling in P11274 / P00519 -transformed cells . Our previous study indicated that P11274 / P00519 SH2 domain and P11274 / P00519 SH3 domain+SH2 domain complex are required for immediate activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI-3k ) --> Akt serine/threonine kinase pathway and of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( P42229 ) , respectively , in hematopoietic cells . We show here that the defect in activation of PI-3k/Akt by P11274 / P00519 DeltaSH2 mutant ( SH2 domain deleted ) and of P42229 by P11274 / P00519 DeltaSH3+DeltaSH2 mutant ( SH3 and SH2 domains deleted ) is not permanent and both Akt and P42229 could be ' re-activated ' by in vitro culture . This phenomenon was responsible for increased resistance to apoptosis , growth factor-independent proliferation and leukemogenesis in SCID mice . Incubation of cells with P11274 / P00519 tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 abrogated the ' re-activation ' of Akt or P42229 by P11274 / P00519 SH3+SH2 mutants in some clones , in the others Akt and P42229 activation became independent on P11274 / P00519 kinase activity . The immediate upstream activators of Akt and P42229 such as PI-3k and Jak-2 were also activated . In addition , the common beta subunit of P08700 / P05113 /GM- P04141 receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated in the clones in which ' re-activation ' was dependent on the P11274 / P00519 kinase activity . These results suggested that ' re-activation ' of Akt and P42229 , in the absence of functional P11274 / P00519 SH3+SH2 domains , may be achieved by two different mechanisms : ( i ) P11274 / P00519 kinase-dependent activation of alternative pathway(s) and ( ii ) additional genetic changes stimulating Akt and P42229 independently of P11274 / P00519 .
