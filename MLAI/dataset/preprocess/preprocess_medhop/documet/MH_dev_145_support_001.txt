Development of T cell-mediated immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation : prolonged impairment of antigen-stimulated production of gamma-interferon . The conditioning regimens for autologous P09683 ( auto- P09683 ) lead to impairment of the immune system and concomitant increase in susceptibility to infections . We studied the recovery of cellular immunity by in vitro analysis of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production profiles during the first 15 months after auto- P09683 in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PBMC were collected at 6 , 9 and 15 months after transplantation and stimulated with a combination of P06729 and P10747 monoclonal antibodies , with PHA or with tetanus toxoid as recall antigen . A multiplex enzyme linked immunoassay was used to determine levels of Th1 cytokines P60568 , P01579 and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , Th2 cytokines P05112 , P05113 and P35225 , the regulatory cytokine P22301 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha , IL-1beta , P05231 and the chemokine P10145 . T-cell proliferation progressively increased from 6 to 15 months after auto- P09683 . Overall , cytokine production increased after auto- P09683 . Production of Th2 cytokines P05113 and P35225 was superior to production of Th1 cytokines P01579 and P01375 . We hypothesize that prolonged impairment of P01579 production might contribute to the relatively high incidence of viral infections after auto- P09683 .
