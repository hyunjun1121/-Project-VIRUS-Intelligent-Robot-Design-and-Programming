Targeted deletion of P28482 in cardiomyocytes attenuates hypertrophic response but provokes pathological stress induced cardiac dysfunction . Mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) are involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and myocyte survival . Extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) are key components in the MAPK signaling pathways . Dysfunction of P27361 /2 in congenital heart diseases ( Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome ) leads to cardiac hypertrophy . P28482 contributes 70 % of protein content to total P27361 /2 content in myocardium ; however , the specific role of P28482 in regulating cardiac hypertrophy is yet to be further defined . To investigate the specific role of P28482 played in the cardiomyocytes , we generated and examined mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the erk2 gene ( P28482 (cko) mice ) . Following short-term pathological hypertrophic stresses , the mutant mice showed attenuated hypertrophic remodeling characterized by a blunted increase in the cross-sectional area of individual myocytes , downregulation of hypertrophic foetal gene markers ( P01160 and DB04899 ) , and less interstitial fibrosis . However , increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis was observed . Upon prolonged stimulation , P28482 (cko) mice developed deterioration in cardiac function . However , absence of P28482 did not affect physiological hypertrophy induced by 4weeks of swimming exercise . These results revealed an essential role for P28482 in cardiomyocytes in the development of pathological hypertrophic remodeling and resistance to cell death .
