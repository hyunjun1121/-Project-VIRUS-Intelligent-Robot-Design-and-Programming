A non-innovator version of etanercept for treatment of arthritis . DB00005 is a soluble tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) receptor originally approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , and psoriatic arthritis . We have developed a non-innovator version of the recombinant protein etanercept , with the investigational name AVG01 ( trade name AVENT™ ) , using a novel expression vector-based technology . Here we show , by extensive analytical characterization , that AVG01 is highly similar to the reference product Enbrel® and demonstrates similar efficacy in pre-clinical studies .
