Nursing supports neonatal porcine testicular development . The lactocrine hypothesis suggests a mechanism whereby milk-borne bioactive factors delivered to nursing offspring affect development of neonatal tissues . The objective of this study was to assess whether nursing affects testicular development in neonatal boars as reflected by : ( 1 ) Sertoli cell number and proliferation measured by GATA-4 expression and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining patterns ; ( 2 ) Leydig cell development and steroidogenic activity as reflected by insulin-like factor 3 ( P51460 ) , and P450 side chain cleavage ( scc ) enzyme expression ; and ( 3 ) expression of estrogen receptor-alpha ( P03372 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) A , and relaxin family peptide receptor ( RXFP ) 1 . At birth , boars were randomly assigned ( n = 6-7/group ) to nurse ad libitum or to be pan fed porcine milk replacer for 48 h . Testes were collected from boars at birth , before nursing and from nursed and replacer-fed boars at 50 h on postnatal day ( P01160 ) 2 . Sertoli cell proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index increased ( P < 0.01 ) from birth to P01160 2 in nursed , but not in replacer-fed boars . Sertoli cell number and testicular GATA-4 protein levels increased ( P < 0.01 ) from P01160 0 to P01160 2 only in nursed boars . Neither age nor nursing affected testicular P51460 , P450scc , P03372 , or P15692 levels . However , testicular relaxin family peptide receptor 1 ( Q9HBX9 ) levels increased ( P < 0.01 ) with age and were greater in replacer-fed boars on P01160 2 . Results suggest that nursing supports neonatal porcine testicular development and provide additional evidence for the importance of lactocrine signaling in pigs .
