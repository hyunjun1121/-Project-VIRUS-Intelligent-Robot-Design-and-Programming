Arachidonic acid metabolism in Q9HBL0 -induced chronic and immunologic enteritis in rats , and the effect of DB00244 . Inflammation of the rat distal intestine was induced by intradermal sensitization and subsequent multiple intrajejunal challenge with the hapten 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ( TNBS ) via an implanted catheter . The time course of the inflammatory reaction was followed by determination of the enteritis score and measurement of in vitro eicosanoid formation of homogenates of the gut after 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 and 21 days of local daily challenge with 0.08 % TNBS . There was a small initial increase of eicosanoid formation , reached at days 1 and 2 , followed by a significant increase in metabolism of arachidonic acid on day 21 . Although at day 1 a four-fold increase in inflammation score was reached , no further significant changes were observed during the following 3 weeks . The greatest increase in metabolite formation was observed in prostanoids TxB(2) , PGE(2). and P52209 (2) and the P09917 product LTC(4) , whereas minor changes were found for Q06643 (4) and other lipoxygenase products such as 12- and 15-HETE . The formation of these metabolites was already inhibited by low-dose DB00244 ( DB00244 ) , given orally twice daily during the 3 weeks challenge period , while the enteritis score was affected dosedependently .
