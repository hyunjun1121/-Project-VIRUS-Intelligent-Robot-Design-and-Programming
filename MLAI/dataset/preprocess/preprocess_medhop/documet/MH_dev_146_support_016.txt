DB08875 overcomes crizotinib resistance in P08922 fusion-positive cancer . PURPOSE : P08922 rearrangement leads to constitutive P08922 activation with potent transforming activity . In an ongoing phase I trial , the Q9UM73 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring P08922 fusions ; however , cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in P08922 . Thus , understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in P08922 -rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The sensitivity of P04233 - P08922 -transformed Ba/ P13726 cells to multiple Q9UM73 inhibitors was examined . Acquired P08922 inhibitor-resistant mutations in P04233 - P08922 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/ P13726 cells . To overcome the resistance mutation , we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials . The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the P04233 - P08922 -mutant Ba/ P13726 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells ( MGH047 ) harboring G2032R-mutated P04233 - P08922 . RESULTS : We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the P08922 kinase domain , including the G2032R mutation . As the result of high-throughput drug screening , we found that the cMET/ P07949 /VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib ( DB05153 ) effectively inhibited the survival of P04233 - P08922 wild-type ( WT ) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/ P13726 and MGH047 cells . Furthermore , cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations . CONCLUSIONS : We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to P08922 inhibitors in NSCLC with P08922 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance .
