Effects of Q07869 agonists on proliferation and differentiation in human urothelium . Systemic treatment of rats with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) agonists ( mainly of dual alpha/gamma activity ) has indicated that they may invoke non-genotoxic carcinogenesis in the epithelial lining of the urinary tract ( urothelium ) . Although there is evidence in the male rat to support an indirect effect via a crystaluria-induced urothelial damage response , there is other evidence to indicate a direct signalling effect on the urothelium and hence the full implication for using these drugs in man is unclear . Numerous reports have demonstrated that PPARs are expressed within the urothelium of different species , including man , and from an early developmental stage . We have developed methods to maintain normal human urothelial ( NHU ) cells in culture , where the cells retain Q07869 expression and express a highly proliferative phenotype , mediated via autocrine stimulation of the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptor . We have shown that specific activation of PPARgamma results in a programme of gene expression changes associated with late/terminal cytodifferentiation , including induction of cytokeratins CK13 and CK20 , tight junction-associated claudin 3 , and uroplakins UPK1a and O00526 , but this is dependent upon inhibition of the signalling cascade downstream of the P01133 receptor . This indicates a subtle balance in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in urothelium , with PPARgamma agonists promoting differentiation . Our data indicate that human urothelium is a target tissue for PPARgamma signalling , but it has yet to be determined whether dual agonists could have a modulatory effect on the proliferation/differentiation balance .
