TNP-470 blockage of P15692 synthesis is dependent on MAPK/ P35354 signaling pathway in DB00102 -activated hepatic stellate cells . Angiogenesis is a key pathogenic event in hepatic fibrogenesis , which is mediated by activated hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) . TNP-470 is a known anti-angiogenic agent in cancer , and in this study , we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of TNP-470 blockage of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) synthesis in activated HSCs . Primary HSCs were isolated from rat liver , cultured in vitro , and activated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB ( DB00102 ) . After treatment with TNP-470 , DB04743 , PD98059 , SB203580 or SP600125 , activated HSCs were analyzed by immunoblotting , quantitative RT-PCR , and ELISA for mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) family [ ERKs , JNK , and p38 ] , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , and P15692 levels . Phosphorylation of Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK , which was followed by increased expressions of P35354 and P15692 , was observed in DB00102 -activated HSCs ; these events could be ameliorated by addition with TNP-470 in time- and dose-dependent manners . TNP-470 also inhibited the secretion of P15692 from activated HSCs into culture supernatant . Furthermore , TNP-470 blockage of P15692 production in activated HSCs could be nullified by exogenous inoculation with prostaglandin E(2) . In summary , our findings suggest that TNP-470 exhibits the observed anti-angiogenic properties in activated HSCs by targeting the P35354 /phospho- Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK pathway to inhibit P15692 production .
