Pharmacological management of gastrointestinal stromal tumours : an update on the role of sunitinib . The efficacy and tolerability of the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , sunitinib malate , have been demonstrated in phase I-III clinical trials of patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( GIST ) as well as in a worldwide expanded-access study and in a continuous daily dosing ( CDD ) trial . Tumour genotype may have a significant influence on the activity of sunitinib in patients with imatinib-resistant GIST . DB01268 activity was observed across different GIST genotypes and particularly in patients with wild-type and P10721 exon 9 mutations ( all relatively resistant to standard-dose imatinib ) and in patients with secondary P10721 exons 13 and 14 mutations . Adverse events with sunitinib were generally mild to moderate and easily managed by dose reduction , dose interruption or standard supportive measures . Treatment discontinuation can be avoided in most patients by close monitoring before and during treatment with appropriate adverse event management as necessary . The correlation between treatment exposure and clinical response is prompting the search for new approaches to treatment optimisation to ensure that patients derive maximum benefit from sunitinib therapy , including dose adjustments based on blood testing to ensure optimal drug exposure , and the use of the alternative CDD regimen to avoid treatment interruption .
