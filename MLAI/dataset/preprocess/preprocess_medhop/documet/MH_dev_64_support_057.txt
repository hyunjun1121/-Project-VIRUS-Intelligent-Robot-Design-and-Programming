Activation by Q99572 agonists of two phospholipases A2 ( P04054 ) in ductal cells of rat submandibular gland . Coupling of the calcium-independent P04054 with kallikrein secretion . Isolated ductal cells of rat submandibular gland phospholipid pools were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid ( AA ) . The tracer was incorporated preferentially to phosphatidylcholine ( 46 % of the lipidic fraction ) . Extracellular DB00171 induced the release of [3H]AA to the extracellular medium in a time- and dose-dependent manner ( EC50 = 220 microM ) . Among other agents tested , only 2 ' , 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate ( Bz- DB00171 ) was able to mimic the effect of DB00171 ( EC50 = 15 microM ) , without activation of phospholipase C . The purinergic antagonists oxidized DB00171 , suramin , and Coomassie Blue partly inhibited the response to 1 mM DB00171 and 100 microM Bz- DB00171 ; the response was also blocked by the addition of Mg2+ or Ni2+ . Expression of Q99572 receptor mRNA in these cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . In the presence of extracellular calcium , the phospholipase A2 inhibitor 2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid ( a nonspecific inhibitor ) , arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone ( AACOCF3 , an inhibitor of the calcium-dependent cytosolic P04054 ( P47712 ) ) , and bromoenol lactone ( an inhibitor of the calcium-independent P04054 ( iPLA2 ) ) inhibited the release of [3H]AA induced by DB00171 and Bz- DB00171 . In the absence of extracellular calcium , the release of [3H]AA in response to the purinergic agonists was still observed ; this response was not affected by AACOCF3 and completely blocked by bromoenol lactone . DB00171 and Bz- DB00171 stimulated a calcium-independent secretion of kallikrein , which could be blocked by BEL but which was enhanced by AACOCF3 . It is concluded that the Q99572 receptor in ductal cells is coupled to kallikrein secretion through a calcium-dependent P47712 and a calcium-independent iPLA2 .
