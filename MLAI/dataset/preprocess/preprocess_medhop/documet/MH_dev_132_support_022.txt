Identification of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites on calmodulin . P01308 enhances calmodulin phosphorylation in vivo . To determine the insulin-sensitive phosphorylation sites , phosphocalmodulin was immunoprecipitated from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human insulin receptors ( CHO/IR ) . P62158 was constitutively phosphorylated on serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues , and insulin enhanced phosphate incorporation on serine and tyrosine residues . Phosphocalmodulin immunoprecipitated from control and insulin-treated CHO/IR cells , and calmodulin phosphorylated in vitro by the insulin receptor kinase and casein kinase II were resolved by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping . Several common phosphopeptides were detected . The phosphopeptides from the in vitro maps were eluted and phosphoamino acid analysis , manual sequencing , strong cation exchange chromatography , and additional proteolysis were performed . This strategy demonstrated that DB00135 -99 and DB00135 -138 were phosphorylated in vitro by the insulin receptor kinase and DB00156 -79 , DB00133 -81 , DB00133 -101 and DB00156 -117 were phosphorylated by casein kinase II . In vivo phosphorylation sites were identified by comigration of phosphopeptides on two-dimensional maps with phosphopeptides derived from calmodulin phosphorylated in vitro and by phosphoamino acid analysis . This approach revealed that DB00135 -99 and DB00135 -138 of calmodulin were phosphorylated in CHO/IR cells in response to insulin . Additional sites remain to be identified . The identification of the insulin-stimulated in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites should facilitate the elucidation of the physiological role of phosphocal-modulin .
