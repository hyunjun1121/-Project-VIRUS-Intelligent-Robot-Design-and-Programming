Serotonin via P34969 receptors activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C epsilon resulting in interleukin-6 synthesis in human U373 MG astrocytoma cells . Serotonin [ 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) ] is a widely distributed neurotransmitter which is involved in neuroimmunomodulatory processes . Previously , it has been demonstrated that 5-HT may induce interleukin ( IL ) -6 expression in primary rat hippocampal astrocytes . The present study was undertaken to investigate the molecular pathways underlying this induction of P05231 synthesis . As a model system , we used the human astrocytoma cell line U373 MG , which synthesizes P05231 upon stimulation with various inducers . 5-HT dose- and time-dependently induced P05231 protein synthesis . We identified several 5-HT receptors to be expressed on U373 MG cells , including the P28221 , 5- Q13049 , 5- Q9H205 and P34969 receptors . In this report , we show that the 5-HT-induced P05231 release is mediated by the P34969 receptor based on several agonist/antagonists that were used . 5-HT-induced P05231 synthesis is inhibited by the partially selective P34969 receptor antagonist , pimozide , and the selective antagonist SB269970 . Furthermore , P05231 synthesis was induced by the P34969 receptor agonist carboxamidotryptamin . In addition , we found p38 MAPKs and protein kinase C ( PKC ) epsilon to be involved in 5-HT-induced P05231 synthesis as specific inhibitors of these enzymes ( SB202190 and RO-31-8425 , respectively ) blocked 5-HT-induced P05231 synthesis . Furthermore , 5-HT mediated the phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK as well as the PKC epsilon isoform . The Q8NFH3 /44 MAPKs , however , were not involved in 5-HT-induced P05231 synthesis . This study shows , for the first time , a central role of P34969 receptor linked to p38 MAPK and PKC epsilon for the induction of cytokine synthesis in astrocytic cells .
