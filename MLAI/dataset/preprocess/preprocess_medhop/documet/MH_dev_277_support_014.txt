Phase I evaluation of DB05243 , an oral , potent , and selective O60674 inhibitor . This phase I study evaluated selective O60674 inhibitor DB05243 in 30 patients with myelofibrosis . The initial dose cohorts were 100 , 200 , and 300 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle . Central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity developed in all patients . Subsequently , patients were treated on lower doses ; neurotoxicity was again observed , leading to study termination . Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 50 % , and central neurotoxicity in all patients within months after therapy cessation . Myelosuppression was minimal . The terminal half-life of DB05243 was approximately 21 h , with steady state reached by Day 8 . International Working Group defined responses were seen in three ( 10 % ) patients .
