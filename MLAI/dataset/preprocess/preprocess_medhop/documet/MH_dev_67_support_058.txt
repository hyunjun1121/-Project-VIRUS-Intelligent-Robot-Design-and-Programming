P30968 concentration differentially regulates intracellular signaling pathways in GGH3 cells . Pituitary cell lines ( GGH3 ) expressing the P30968 ( GnRHR ) were used to investigate the effect of GnRHR concentration on the ability of a DB00644 agonist to activate second messenger systems . Four different strategies were utilized to generate cells expressing functionally different concentrations of receptors : ( 1 ) transient transfection with different concentrations of wild type GnRHR into GH3 cells , ( 2 ) utilization of two cell lines derived from a common stably transfected line expressing high ( 4,209 +/- 535 receptors/cell ) or low ( 1,031 +/- 36 receptors/cell ) concentrations of GnRHR , ( 3 ) co-incubation of GGH3-1 ' cells with a DB00644 agonist ( DB06719 ) and a DB00644 antagonist to compete for binding sites , and ( 4 ) photo-affinity binding to GnRHR with a DB00644 antagonist to change effective receptor concentration . A range of receptor concentrations ( 1,000-8,000 receptors/cell ) were generated by these techniques . Inositol phosphate ( IP ) and DB02527 accumulation were quantified to assess the effect of receptor concentration on receptor-effector coupling . Under all four paradigms , the efficacy and potency of DB06719 stimulated IP production was dependent on receptor concentration . In contrast , DB06719 stimulated DB02527 release was relatively unchanged at varying concentrations of GnRHR . This suggests that the cellular concentration of GnRHR affects the induction of cell signaling pathways . These results demonstrate that a single ligand-receptor-complex can differentially activate second messenger systems and present a mechanism by which multiple physiological endpoints can be differentially regulated by a single hormone/receptor interaction .
