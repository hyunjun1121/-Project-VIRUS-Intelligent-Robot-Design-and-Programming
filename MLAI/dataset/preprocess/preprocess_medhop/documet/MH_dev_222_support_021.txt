Is olomoucine , a weak P24941 inhibitor , able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells ? DB02116 ( OLO ) , a substituted purine analogue , is a much weaker inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases than other closely related DB00171 derivatives . It has been recently reported that OLO did not affect the viability of normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts , but it inhibited the proliferation of human HL-60 leukemia cells . Therefore , it was interesting to explore the antiproliferative effect of OLO and to characterize its action on distinct human cancer cells differing in the functional status of the cell cycle . Human HeLa cervical carcinoma and HL-60 leukemia cells were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of OLO for 24 h and 48 h or alternatively , cells after treatment for 24 h were postincubated in a drug-free medium . Surprisingly , OLO more strongly affected the proliferation of HL-60 cells than that of HeLa cells . Flow cytometric analyses revealed that OLO at higher doses increases the frequency of a hypoploid HL-60 cell population representing cells undergoing apoptosis . These results substantiated the data of the determination of the number of viable cells . Moreover , OLO at higher doses modulates the cell cycle progression of tested cancer cells . Detailed analyses of the DNA concentration in single cells revealed that OLO-mediated reduction of the number of G(1)-phase cells was accompanied by an increase of the frequency of G(2)-phase cells . The kinetics of these changes differed between both tested cancer cell lines , suggesting that some cancer cells exhibit increased susceptibility to OLO action . It remains to clarify whether the strong proapoptotic effect of OLO observed in HL-60 cells depends on their differentiation status .
