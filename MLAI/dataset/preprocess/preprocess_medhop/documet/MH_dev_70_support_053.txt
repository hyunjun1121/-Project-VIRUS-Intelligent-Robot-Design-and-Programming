Genetic and biochemical markers in patients with Alzheimer 's disease support a concerted systemic iron homeostasis dysregulation . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly individuals , resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors . Impaired brain iron homeostasis has been recognized as an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of this disease . Nevertheless , the knowledge gathered so far at the systemic level is clearly insufficient . Herein , we used an integrative approach to study iron metabolism in the periphery , at both genotypic and phenotypic levels , in a sample of 116 patients with AD and 89 healthy control subjects . To assess the potential impact of iron metabolism on the risk of developing AD , genetic analyses were performed along with the evaluation of the iron status profile in peripheral blood by biochemical and gene expression studies . The results obtained showed a significant decrease of serum iron , ferritin , and transferrin concentrations in patients compared with the control subjects . Also , a significant decrease of ferroportin ( Q9NP59 ) and both transferrin receptors P02786 and Q9UP52 transcripts was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients . At the genetic level , significant associations with AD were found for single nucleotide polymorphisms in TF , Q9UP52 , P21399 , and Q9NP59 genes . P02649 gene , a well-known risk factor for AD , was also found significantly associated with the disease in this study . Taken together , we hypothesize that the alterations on systemic iron status observed in patients could reflect an iron homeostasis dysregulation , particularly in cellular iron efflux . The intracellular iron accumulation would lead to a rise in oxidative damage , contributing to AD pathophysiology .
