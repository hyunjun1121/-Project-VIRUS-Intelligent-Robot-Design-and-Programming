Antiinflammatory effect of lactic acid bacteria : inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by suppressing nuclear factor-kappaB in Raw264.7 macrophage cells . Lactobacillus casei 3260 ( L. casei 3260 ) was evaluated in relation to the inflammatory response mediated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression in Raw264.7 macrophage cells . The treatment of Raw264.7 cells with L. casei 3260 significantly inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) and prostaglandins E2 ( DB00917 ) , followed by suppression of P35354 . To clarify the molecular mechanism , the inhibitory effect of L. casei 3260 on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway was examined based on the luciferase reporter activity . Although the treatment of Raw264.7 cells with L. casei 3260 did not affect the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB , it did inhibit NF-kappaB activation , as determined by the cytosolic p65 release and degradation of I-kappaBalpha . Therefore , these findings suggest that the suppression of P35354 through inhibiting the NF-kappaB activation by LPS may be associated with the antiinflammatory effects of L. casei 3260 on Raw264.7 cells .
