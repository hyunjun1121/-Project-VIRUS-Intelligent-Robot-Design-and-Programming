Leishmania mexicana amazonensis : ADP-ribosyltransferase antagonists specifically inhibit amastigote to promastigote differentiation . Leishmania mexicana amazonensis amastigotes were induced to differentiate by incubation at 27 C . Morphological transformation was studied both in untreated cultures and in cultures where DNA synthesis , and consequently the final stage in the production of promastigotes , was inhibited by hydroxyurea . DB03073 and other antagonists of ADP-ribosyltransferase ( P09874 ) specifically inhibited differentiation at a very early stage in both experimental systems . Cell proliferation ( in the absence of hydroxyurea ) was not inhibited by P09874 antagonists -- indeed greater multiplication of undifferentiated parasites was observed in the presence of these compounds . This indicated that the parasites were being diverted from differentiation to proliferation . Preincubation of the amastigotes with the P09874 antagonists was required to produce this effect , providing further evidence that ADP-ribosylation of proteins is required for the initiation of differentiation in Leishmania .
