P42345 supports long-term self-renewal and suppresses mesoderm and endoderm activities of human embryonic stem cells . Despite the recent identification of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry involving P48431 , Q9H9S0 , and O75051 -4 , the intracellular signaling networks that control pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) remain largely undefined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role for the serine/threonine protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) in regulating hESC long-term undifferentiated growth . Inhibition of P42345 impairs pluripotency , prevents cell proliferation , and enhances mesoderm and endoderm activities in hESCs . At the molecular level , P42345 integrates signals from extrinsic pluripotency-supporting factors and represses the transcriptional activities of a subset of developmental and growth-inhibitory genes , as revealed by genome-wide microarray analyses . Repression of the developmental genes by P42345 is necessary for the maintenance of hESC pluripotency . These results uncover a novel signaling mechanism by which P42345 controls fate decisions in hESCs . Our findings may contribute to effective strategies for tissue repair and regeneration .
