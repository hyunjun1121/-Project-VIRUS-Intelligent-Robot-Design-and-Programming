Adverse effects of DB01262 on spermatogenesis include reduced sperm function and selective inhibition of de novo DNA methylation . The anticancer agent , DB01262 ( 5-azaCdR , decitabine ) , causes DNA hypomethylation and a robust , dose-dependent disruption of spermatogenesis . Previously , we have shown that altered testicular histology and reduced sperm production in 5-azaCdR-treated animals is associated with decreased global sperm DNA methylation and an increase in infertility and/or a decreased ability to support preimplantation embryonic development . The goal of this study was to determine potential contributors to 5-azaCdR-mediated infertility including alterations in sperm motility , fertilization ability , early embryo development , and sequence-specific DNA methylation . We find that although 5-azaCdR-treatment adversely affected sperm motility and the survival of sired embryos to the blastocyst stage , the major contributor to infertility was a marked ( 56-70 % ) decrease in fertilization ability . Sperm DNA methylation was investigated using Southern blot , restriction landmark genomic scanning , and quantitative analysis of DNA methylation by real-time polymerase chain reaction . Interestingly , hypomethylation was restricted to genomic loci that have been previously determined to acquire methylation during spermatogenesis , demonstrating that 5-azaCdR selectively inhibits de novo methylation activity . Similar to previous studies , we show that mice that are heterozygous for a nonfunctional P26358 gene are partially protected against the deleterious effects of 5-azaCdR ; however , methylation levels are not restored in these mice , suggesting that adverse effects are due to another mechanism(s) in addition to DNA hypomethylation . These results demonstrate that clinically relevant doses of 5-azaCdR specifically impair de novo methylation activity in male germ cells ; however , genotype-specific differences in drug responses suggest that adverse reproductive outcomes are mainly mediated by the cytotoxic properties of the drug .
