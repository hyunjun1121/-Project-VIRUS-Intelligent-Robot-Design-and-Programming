Clinical pharmacology of cyclooxygenase inhibition and pharmacodynamic interaction with aspirin by floctafenine in Thai healthy subjects . DB08976 , a hydroxyquinoline derivative with analgesic properties , is widely used in Thailand and many other countries . The objectives of this study were to evaluate in Thai healthy volunteers : i ) the inhibition of whole blood cyclooxygenase( P36551 )-2 and P23219 activity by floctafenine and its metabolite floctafenic acid in vitro and ex vivo after dosing with floctafenine ; ii ) the possible interference of floctafenine administration with aspirin antiplatelet effects . We performed an open-label , cross-over , 3-period study , on 11 healthy Thai volunteers , who received consecutively floctafenine(200mg/TID) , low-dose aspirin(81mg/daily) or their combination for 4 days , separated by washout periods . DB08976 and floctafenic acid resulted potent inhibitors of P23219 and P35354 in vitro ( floctafenic acid was more potent than floctafenine ) showing a slight preference for P23219 . After dosing with floctafenine alone , whole blood P23219 and P35354 activities were inhibited ex vivo in a time-dependent fashion which paralleled floctafenic acid plasma concentrations . DB00945 alone inhibited profoundly and persistently platelet P23219 activity and AA-induced platelet aggregation throughout 24-h dosing interval which was affected by the co-administration of floctafenine . At 24 h after dosing with aspirin and floctafenine , the inhibition of platelet thromboxane(TX)B2 generation and aggregation were significantly ( P less than 0.05 ) lower than that caused by aspirin alone . Therapeutic dosing with floctafenine profoundly inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis through the rapid conversion to floctafenic acid . DB08976 interfered with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin . Our results suggest that floctafenine should be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease under treatment with low-dose aspirin .
