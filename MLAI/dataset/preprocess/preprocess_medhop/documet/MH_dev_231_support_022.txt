Lobe-specific calcium binding in calmodulin regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation . BACKGROUND : Human endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) requires calcium-bound calmodulin ( P62158 ) for electron transfer but the detailed mechanism remains unclear . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Using a series of P62158 mutants with E to Q substitution at the four calcium-binding sites , we found that single mutation at any calcium-binding site ( B1Q , B2Q , B3Q and B4Q ) resulted in âˆ¼2-3 fold increase in the P62158 concentration necessary for half-maximal activation ( EC50 ) of citrulline formation , indicating that each calcium-binding site of P62158 contributed to the association between P62158 and P29474 . DB00155 formation and cytochrome c reduction assays revealed that in comparison with P29475 or P35228 , P29474 was less stringent in the requirement of calcium binding to each of four calcium-binding sites . However , lobe-specific disruption with double mutations in calcium-binding sites either at N- ( B12Q ) or at C-terminal ( B34Q ) lobes greatly diminished both P29474 oxygenase and reductase activities . Gel mobility shift assay and flavin fluorescence measurement indicated that N- and C-lobes of P62158 played distinct roles in regulating P29474 catalysis ; the C-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form was responsible for the binding of canonical P62158 -binding domain , while N-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form controlled the movement of Q68DA7 domain . Limited proteolysis studies further demonstrated that B12Q and B34Q induced different conformational change in P29474 . CONCLUSIONS : Our results clearly demonstrate that P62158 controls P29474 electron transfer primarily through its lobe-specific calcium binding .
