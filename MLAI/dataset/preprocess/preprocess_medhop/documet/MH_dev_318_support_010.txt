Clinical and pathogenic aspects of candidate genes for lithium prophylactic efficacy . A number of candidate genes for lithium prophylactic efficacy have been proposed , some of them being also associated with a predisposition to bipolar illness . The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible association between polymorphisms of 14 common genes with the quality of prophylactic lithium response in patients with bipolar mood disorder , in relation to the putative role of these genes in the pathogenesis of this disorder . Some association with lithium prophylactic efficacy was found for the polymorphisms of P31645 , P21728 , P21964 , P23560 and P06241 genes , but not for 5HT2A , 5HT2C , P14416 , P35462 , P21917 , GSK-3 , Q16620 , Q13224 and P14780 . Possible aspects of these genes with regard to the mechanism of lithium activity and pathogenesis of bipolar mood disorder are discussed .
