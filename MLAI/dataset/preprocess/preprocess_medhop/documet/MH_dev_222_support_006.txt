Heterozygous missense mutations in the insulin gene are linked to permanent diabetes appearing in the neonatal period or in early infancy : a report from the French ND ( Neonatal Diabetes ) Study Group . OBJECTIVE : Permanent neonatal diabetes ( P01160 ) is defined by chronic hyperglycemia due to severe nonautoimmune insulin deficiency diagnosed in the first months of life . Several genes , including Q14654 and Q09428 , which encode the two subunits of the DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channel ( K( DB00171 ) channel ) can cause P01160 . Mutations in the insulin ( P01308 ) gene have been recently described in families with neonatal diabetes . Our study aimed to investigate the genetic anomalies and clinical heterogeneity in P01160 patients who are negative for a K( DB00171 ) channel mutation . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We screened the P01308 gene by direct sequencing in 38 P01160 patients and in one child with nonautoimmune early-infancy diabetes , where no mutation in GCK , Q14654 , and Q09428 was identified . A detailed clinical phenotyping of the patients was carried out to specify the diabetes features in those found with an P01308 mutation . RESULTS : We identified three missense mutations in the P01308 gene in four probands . Two of four mutations were inherited in a dominant manner , and the familial description evidenced a marked variability in age of diagnosis and disease progression . In our cohort , the P01308 mutations may represent approximately 10 % of all permanent neonatal diabetes cases , having a later presentation of diabetes and no associated symptoms compared with cases with K( DB00171 ) channel mutations . CONCLUSIONS ; Heterozygous P01308 gene mutations can cause isolated permanent early-infancy diabetes and should be assessed in neonatal as well as in childhood diabetes appearing like type 1 , when autoimmune markers are absent . New pharmacogenomic strategies may be applicable , since residual beta-cell function is still present in some patients .
