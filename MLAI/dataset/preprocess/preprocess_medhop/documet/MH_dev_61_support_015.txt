Induction of nerve growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA following clenbuterol : contrasting anatomical and cellular localization . RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization were used to analyze the temporal and cellular changes in nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) mRNA content evoked by the lipophilic beta-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol in adult rat brain . DB01407 elicited a threefold increase in P01138 mRNA expression which was limited to the cerebral cortex . This increase was maximal at 5 h , still evident by 10 h , and declined to control levels by 24 h . By 10 h P01138 protein was also increased . Elevated P01138 mRNA hybridization following clenbuterol was localized in the superficial cortical layers II and III in large Nissl-pale cells , suggesting that P01138 mRNA induction occurs in neurons . In the same animals , clenbuterol induced a twofold increase in the levels of P09038 mRNA in cerebral cortex and hippocampus . This increase was localized primarily in glial cells as demonstrated by P09038 mRNA hybridization over all cortical regions and by labeling of the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the hippocampus . Our results suggest that enhanced noradrenergic tone regulates expression of these two trophic factors by different synaptic mechanisms and suggest that neurotransmitter(s) can coordinate trophic influences on different cell populations .
