A one-hour infusion of infliximab during maintenance therapy is safe and well tolerated : a prospective cohort study . BACKGROUND : DB00065 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 Î± ) with efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission of inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis . DB00065 is generally administered over 2h with a further 1-h postinfusion observation . This time interval has substantial impact on healthcare resources and is costly in terms of patient 's time away from work . AIM : To examine the safety and tolerability of a 1-h , relative to a 2-h maintenance of infusion of infliximab , and to determine the effect of corticosteroid premedication and concurrent immunosuppressor use on infusion reaction rates . METHOD : A prospective cohort study with variable follow-up duration of 2165 consecutive infliximab infusions in 415 patients during 2009 was conducted . Diagnosis , infusion episode number , infusion rate , premedication , concurrent immunosuppressor therapy , the nature and the outcome of infusion reactions were examined . RESULTS : The majority of infusions ( 74 % ) were for management of inflammatory bowel disease . Infusion reactions clustered within the first eight infusions with subsequent sporadic reactions . The infusion reaction incidence rate per 1000 person days in 274 1-h infusions from 54 patients and 1356 2-h infusions from 256 patients were 0.08 and 0.28 respectively ( P=0.07 ) . Poisson regression model confirmed that the concurrent use of immunosuppressor therapy was associated with a lower infusion reaction rate , whereas corticosteroid premedication was not . CONCLUSIONS : During maintenance therapy , infliximab infusion can be safely administered over 1h in patients with no past history of significant infliximab infusion reaction . Corticosteroid premedication had no impact on the infusion reaction rates .
