Association between apolipoprotein E4 and rehabilitation outcome in hospitalized ischemic stroke patients . OBJECTIVE : To determine the value of apolipoprotein E4 ( P02649 *E4 ) allele in predicting discharge impairment and disability in ischemic stroke patients after acute rehabilitation . DESIGN : Prospective study comparing results of rehabilitation in patients with different P02649 genotypes . SETTING : Acute neurologic rehabilitation department in Israel . PARTICIPANTS : One hundred one consecutive patients 75 years old or less with a first ischemic stroke . INTERVENTIONS : Not applicable . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Impairment , as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) , and disability , as assessed with the Q9UBW7 trade mark instrument . RESULTS : On admission , there was no significant difference in the Q9UBW7 or NIHSS measurements between the apo E4 group and other patients , but the prevalence of aphasia was 2.07 times more frequent in those with the P02649 *E4 genotype ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.98-4.4 ) . A logistic regression model demonstrated that score measurements on admission were highly predictive of the NIHSS score at discharge ( receiver operator curve=96.1 % ) , whereas the presence of the P02649 *E4 genotype did not add significantly to the model in predicting poorer rehabilitation treatment outcome as measured by the Q9UBW7 or the NIHSS . CONCLUSIONS : The presence of the apo E4 allele did not predict a poorer outcome of rehabilitation treatment after ischemic stroke , but it was associated with an increased prevalence of aphasia . Further studies are warranted to confirm this association .
