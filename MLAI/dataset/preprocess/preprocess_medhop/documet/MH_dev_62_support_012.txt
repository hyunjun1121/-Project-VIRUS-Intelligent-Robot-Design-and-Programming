DB08904 in rheumatoid arthritis : current update . INTRODUCTION : The development of P01375 -α inhibitors ( P01375 -is ) represents a major advancement in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Currently , there are five agents licensed for moderate-to-severely active RA . DB08904 ( CZP ) is a novel PEGylated , constant fragment-free P01375 -i therapy , which is the focus of this review . AREAS COVERED : Data from Phase III randomised controlled trials in terms of clinical efficacy , radiographic progression , patient-reported outcomes and safety profile are reviewed . These include long-term data from open-label extension studies . EXPERT OPINION : The advantages of CZP include rapid reduction of disease activity , low rates of injection-site reaction and may be safe for use in pregnancy . The long-term data strengthen the position of CZP for use either as monotherapy or preferably in combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) , in moderate-to-severely active RA , comparable to other P01375 -is . Notably , prolonged CZP exposure is not associated with increased risk of severe infection compared to general population , contrasting with preliminary analysis of short-term data . Over the next few years , evidence will be available on the use of CZP in combination with methotrexate for remission induction in DMARD-naïve patients , biomarkers and the development and licensing of P01375 -i biosimilars .
