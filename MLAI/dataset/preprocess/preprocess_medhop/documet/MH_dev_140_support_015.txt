Role of presynaptic serotonergic receptors on the mechanism of action of P08908 and P28222 agonists on masculine sexual behaviour : physiological and pharmacological implications . In order to establish whether the P08908 or the 5HT1B agonists , 8-OH-DPAT or TFMPP , produce their facilitatory or inhibitory actions on masculine sexual behaviour via a mechanism involving : ( a ) the serotonin synthesis or release ; ( b ) the stimulation of presynaptic receptors , or ( c ) the stimulation of somatodendritic receptors , three series of experiments were performed . The administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor , p-chlorophenylalanine ( p- P15085 , 300 mg/kg x 3 days ) , facilitated sexual behaviour but does not interfere neither with the inhibitory nor with the facilitatory effects of TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) or 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) , respectively . The icv or the intraraph√© administration of the serotonergic neurotoxin , 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine ( 5,7- DB02901 ) , slightly stimulated masculine sexual behaviour and produced a decrease in serotonin and its metabolite levels . In lesioned animals TFMPP ( 0.5 mg/kg ) resulted in an inhibitory effect reflected as a prolongation of the ejaculation latency . The inhibitory effect of this drug on mounting behaviour was not observed in 5,7- DB02901 treated rats . In lesioned animals 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.5 mg/kg ) produced the same facilitatory effect . Present data indicate that serotonergic postsynaptic receptors mediate both the inhibitory and the facilitatory actions of TFMPP or 8-OH-DPAT in copulation . All data further support the idea that endogenous serotonin acts via the stimulation of P28222 receptors to induce its inhibitory effects on masculine sexual behaviour .
