Phenotypic analysis of conditionally immortalized cells isolated from the Q06187 model of ARPKD . To study the pathophysiology of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ) , we sought to develop conditionally immortalized control and cystic murine collecting tubule ( CT ) cell lines . CT cells were isolated from intercross breedings between Q06187 mice ( bpk(+/-) ) , a murine model of ARPKD , and the Immorto mice ( H-2K(b)-ts-A58(+/+) ) . Second-generation outbred offspring ( Q06187 x Immorto ) homozygous for the Q06187 mutation ( bpk(-/-) ; Im(+/+/-) ; cystic Q06187 /H-2K(b)-ts-A58 ) , were phenotypically indistinguishable from inbred cystic Q06187 animals ( bpk(-/-) ) . Cystic Q06187 /H-2K(b)-ts-A58 mice developed biliary ductal ectasia and massively enlarged kidneys , leading to renal failure and death by postnatal day 24 . Principal cells ( PC ) were isolated from outbred cystic and noncystic Q06187 /H-2K(b)-ts-A58 littermates at specific developmental stages . Epithelial monolayers were under nonpermissive conditions for markers of epithelial cell polarity and PC function . Cystic and noncystic cells displayed several properties characteristic of PCs in vivo , including amiloride-sensitive sodium transport and aquaporin 2 expression . Cystic cells exhibited apical epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) mislocalization but normal expression of ZO-1 and P12830 . Hence , these cell lines retain the requisite characteristics of PCs , and cystic Q06187 /H-2K(b)-ts-A58 PCs retained the abnormal P00533 membrane expression characteristic of ARPKD . These cell lines represent important new reagents for studying the pathogenesis of ARPKD .
