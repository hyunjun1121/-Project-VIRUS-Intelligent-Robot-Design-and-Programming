DB00005 for therapy-resistant macrophage activation syndrome . Macrophage activation syndrome ( P04201 ) is a severe , potentially fatal complication of childhood rheumatic diseases , especially systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( SoJIA ) . We report a 4-year-old girl with probable SoJIA who presented with P04201 . She did not respond to pulse methyl prednisolone and DB00091 A ( DB00091 ) . She also failed to respond to intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) therapy . DB00005 was started , based on the observation of increased serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) in patients with P04201 . Her condition improved following etanercept , suggesting that etanercept might have a therapeutic role in resistant P04201 .
