P04626 -positive breast cancer : beyond trastuzumab . The outlook for patients with P04626 -positive breast cancer was revolutionized by the development of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , a humanized murine monoclonal antibody . Use of this agent led to improved overall survival when it was added to chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Improved understanding of mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab has facilitated the development of novel agents for P04626 -positive breast cancer , and also resulted in superior outcomes when added to chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting . This review explores the use of several such agents , including lapatinib ( DB01259 ) , HSP90 inhibitors , DB05773 , and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Emerging data from trials of these agents indicate that the P04626 pathway remains a valid therapeutic target following disease progression on trastuzumab , and suggest a promising role for combined P04626 blockade with two or more agents .
