[ The concept of aspirin " resistance " : mechanisms and clinical relevance ] . DB00945 , a 110-year-old molecule , is a cornerstone in the treatment of atherothrombotic patients . The concept of aspirin " resistance " emerged approximately 15 years ago and is of growing interest . DB00945 resistance , defined as a lack of inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) , is a rare phenomenon and its clinical relevance can hardly be studied . On the contrary , residual platelet hyperactivity is more common and affects 20 to 30 % of aspirin-treated patients . This latter phenomenon corresponds to sustained platelet reactivity despite a proper inhibition of P23219 by aspirin . Several meta-analyses suggest that residual platelet hyperactivity could be a risk factor for the recurrence of ischemic events in aspirin-treated patients . Causes of biological non-responsiveness to aspirin are discussed , including the role of compliance , drug-drug interactions , genetic polymorphisms and diabetes mellitus . Ongoing studies are designed to find out the mechanisms of residual platelet hyperactivity , determine its potential clinical relevance and delineate the more appropriate assays in order to identify patients who may benefit of a tailored antiplatelet therapy .
