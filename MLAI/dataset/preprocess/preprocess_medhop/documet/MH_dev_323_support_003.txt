Partial trypsin digestion as an indicator of mis-folding of mutant alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and chaperone effects of specific ligands . Study of a spectrum of missense mutants . DB00160 :glyoxylate aminotransferase ( AGT ) is a liver peroxisomal enzyme whose deficiency results in primary hyperoxaluria type 1 ( P78364 ) . More than 75 P78364 mutations are now documented in the AGT gene ( P21549 ) , of which about 50 % are missense . We have previously demonstrated that many such mutants expressed by transcription/translation are subject to generalized degradation by the proteasome and a specific limited trimming by an endogenous DB00171 -independent protease activity . Here , we report the results of partial digestion using trypsin as a mimic for the endogenous non-proteasomal protease and the use of N-terminal protein sequencing to determine the sensitive site . Partial trypsin digestion also provided an indicator of proper folding of the mutant enzyme . For selected mutations the sensitivity to trypsin could be ameliorated by addition of pyridoxal phosphate or aminooxy acetic acid as specific pharmacological chaperones .
