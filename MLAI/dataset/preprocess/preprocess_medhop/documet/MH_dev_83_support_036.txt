[ The effects of DB00482 on mammary tumorigenesis and aging in P04626 /neu transgenic mice ] . It is well known that cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) plays an important role in the development of many tumors including breast cancer . Our study was concerned with evaluating the effects of the selective P35354 inhibitor , celecoxib , on mammary tumorigenesis and aging in P04626 /neu transgenic mice ( 24 ) . Celecoxib ( celebrex ) 25 mg/kg was administered 5 times a week from the age of 2 months . Twenty-four intact females were in control . Monitoring kept track of tumor detection time , size , presence of lung metastases , food and water consumption , estral function , body weight and temperature . No significant differences between the two groups were reported as far as life-span , tumor growth rate , size and number of metastases to the lung is concerned . To sum up , celecoxib treatment failed to produce any significant effect on carcinogenesis in P04626 /neu transgenic mice .
