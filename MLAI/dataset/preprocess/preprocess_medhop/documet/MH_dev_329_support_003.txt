Immune responses to murine monoclonal antibody- DB04964 correlate with prolonged survival of women with recurrent ovarian cancer . OBJECTIVE : We evaluated the therapeutic efficiency of the murine monoclonal antibody- DB04964 in the treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer . STUDY DESIGN : This was a retrospective study of immune responses and survival in 44 patients who were treated with technetium 99m-labeled monoclonal antibody- DB04964 , a murine monoclonal antibody that is directed against the tumor-associated antigen Q8WXI7 . Most patients were pretreated heavily . Biologic activity was quantified by the assay of immune responses to the human anti-murine antibodies against the monoclonal antibody- DB04964 variable region ( Ab(2) ) and antibodies that target the CA 125 antigen itself ( anti-CA 125 antibody ) . RESULTS : More than one half of patients ( 56.8 % ) survived for > 12 months after the first dose of monoclonal antibody DB04964 ; 34.1 % of the patients survived > 24 months . To date , 6 of the 44 patients are alive , with survival times of 4 to 7.5 years after the start of the antibody treatment . More than 60 % of the evaluable patients met predefined criteria for robust , treatment-emergent human anti-murine antibodies and Ab(2) responses , and these responses were associated with improved survival rates . Median survival time increased approximately 3-fold for human anti-murine antibody responders ( 22.6 months ) versus nonresponders ( 7.2 months ; P < .0016 , log-rank test ) and 2-fold for Ab(2) responders ( 18.3 months ) versus nonresponders ( 9.3 months ) . No serious drug-associated adverse events were reported . CONCLUSION : The associations between multiple types of immune response and improved clinical outcomes suggest that monoclonal antibody- DB04964 should be further evaluated for potential use as an immunotherapy for Q8WXI7 -expressing malignancies .
