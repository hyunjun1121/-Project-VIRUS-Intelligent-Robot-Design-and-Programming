The molecular mechanisms underlying the reduction of LDL apoB-100 by ezetimibe plus simvastatin . The combination of ezetimibe , an inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein ( Q9UHC9 ) , and an P04035 inhibitor decreases cholesterol absorption and synthesis . In clinical trials , ezetimibe plus simvastatin produces greater LDL-cholesterol reductions than does monotherapy . The molecular mechanism for this enhanced efficacy has not been defined . P04114 ( apoB-100 ) kinetics were determined in miniature pigs treated with ezetimibe ( 0.1 mg/kg/day ) , ezetimibe plus simvastatin ( 10 mg/kg/day ) , or placebo ( n = 7/group ) . DB00973 decreased cholesterol absorption ( -79 % ) and plasma phytosterols ( -91 % ) , which were not affected further by simvastatin . DB00973 increased plasma lathosterol ( +65 % ) , which was prevented by addition of simvastatin . The combination decreased total cholesterol ( -35 % ) and LDL-cholesterol ( -47 % ) . VLDL apoB pool size decreased 26 % , due to a 35 % decrease in VLDL apoB production . LDL apoB pool size decreased 34 % due to an 81 % increase in the fractional catabolic rate , both of which were significantly greater than monotherapy . Combination treatment decreased hepatic microsomal cholesterol ( -29 % ) and cholesteryl ester ( -65 % ) and increased P01130 ( P01130 ) expression by 240 % . The combination increased Q9UHC9 expression in liver and intestine , consistent with increased Q12772 expression . DB00973 plus simvastatin decreases VLDL and LDL apoB-100 concentrations through reduced VLDL production and upregulation of P01130 -mediated LDL clearance .
