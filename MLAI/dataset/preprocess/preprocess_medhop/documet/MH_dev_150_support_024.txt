Recent androgen receptor antagonists in prostate cancer . P10275 has been shown to promote prostate cell growth and carcinogenesis of prostate cancer by up-regulating its target genes . DB00624 and dihydrotestosterone are two major hormones which bind to and activate androgen receptor . Targeting both the androgen receptor and the enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone has been shown to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer . Prostate cancer can become castration-resistant after long term treatment with chemo drugs , so efforts in finding compounds with improved efficiency to castration-resistant prostate cancer are urgently needed . In this review we summarized the studies on recent progress in the development of small molecular AR antagonists for the treatment of prostate cancer .
