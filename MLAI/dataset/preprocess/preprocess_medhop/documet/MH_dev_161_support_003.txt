Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . DB08895 is the first in a new class of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) , a targeted , synthetic DMARD , approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARD . DB08895 , an orally administered Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , decreases T-cell activation , pro-inflammatory cytokine production , and cytokine signaling by inhibiting binding of type I cytokine receptors family and Î³-chain cytokines to paired P23458 / P52333 receptors . The net effect of tofacitinb 's mechanism of action is decreased synovial inflammation and structural joint damage in RA patients . To date , six phase 3 trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib under the oral rheumatoid arthritis triaLs ( ORAL ) series . This review describes the pharmacology of the novel agent , tofacitinib , and details the safety and efficacy data of the ORAL trials .
