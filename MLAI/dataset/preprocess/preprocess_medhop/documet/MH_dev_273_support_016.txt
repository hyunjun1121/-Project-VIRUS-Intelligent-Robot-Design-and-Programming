Novel mechanism of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation mediated by caveolae internalization in endothelial cells . Q03135 , the caveolae scaffolding protein , binds to and negatively regulates P29474 activity . As caveolin-1 also regulates caveolae-mediated endocytosis after activation of the 60-kDa albumin-binding glycoprotein gp60 in endothelial cells , we addressed the possibility that endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) -dependent NO production was functionally coupled to caveolae internalization . We observed that gp60-induced activation of endocytosis increased NO production within 2 minutes and up to 20 minutes . NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine ( DB04223 ) prevented the NO production . To determine the role of caveolae internalization in the mechanism of NO production , we expressed dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant ( K44A ) or treated cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin . Both interventions inhibited caveolae-mediated endocytosis and NO generation induced by gp60 . We determined the role of signaling via Src kinase in the observed coupling of endocytosis to P29474 activation . Src activation induced the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 , Akt and P29474 , and promoted dissociation of P29474 from caveolin-1 . Inhibitors of Src kinase and Akt also prevented NO production . In isolated perfused mouse lungs , gp60 activation induced NO-dependent vasodilation , whereas the response was attenuated in P29474 (-/-) or caveolin-1(-/-) lungs . Together , these results demonstrate a critical role of caveolae-mediated endocytosis in regulating P29474 activation in endothelial cells and thereby the NO-dependent vasomotor tone .
