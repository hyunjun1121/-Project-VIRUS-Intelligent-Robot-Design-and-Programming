A novel O00408 reporter cell line : characterization of the cellular activity of PDE inhibitors . We report here the generation and pharmacological characterization of a phosphodiesterase 2A ( O00408 ) reporter cell line . Human O00408 was stably transfected in a parental cell line expressing the atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) receptor and the cyclic nucleotide-gated ( CNG ) cation channel Q16280 , acting as the biosensor for intracellular cGMP . In this reporter cell line , cGMP levels can be monitored in real-time via aequorin luminescence stimulated by calcium influx through the CNG channel . By using different PDE inhibitors , we could show that our O00408 reporter assay specifically monitors O00408 inhibition with high sensitivity . In the absence of P01160 stimulation , the O00408 selective inhibitors EHNA , BAY 60-7550 and Q9P0J1 did not increase basal luminescence levels in this experimental setting . However , in combination with P01160 , these inhibitors stimulated luminescence signals and induced leftward shifts of P01160 concentration-response curves . Similar results were obtained when using DB07954 , trequinsin and dipyridamole , which inhibit O00408 nonselectively with lower potency . Q9P0J1 , the most potent O00408 inhibitor known to date , was found to exhibit much lower cellular activity as anticipated from its biochemical O00408 inhibitory activity . By cellular uptake and transport studies we could show that Q9P0J1 's cell permeability is low and that the compound is a substrate for an efflux transporter . Other PDE inhibitors including vinpocetine , milrinone , rolipram , sildenafil , zaprinast , O95696 50481 and BAY 73-6691 did not stimulate luminescence signals on our O00408 reporter cell line . The results imply that this novel O00408 reporter assay provides an efficient , high throughput means for the identification and characterization of O00408 inhibitors .
