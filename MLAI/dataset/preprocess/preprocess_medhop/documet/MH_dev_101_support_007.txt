DB01197 attenuates matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in rats . Little is known about the influence of angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors on matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) in right ventricular remodeling . We investigated the effect of captopril , an P12821 inhibitor , on P08253 and P14780 in monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy . Six-week-old male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with monocrotaline ( 60 mg/kg ) or saline . The rats were administrated captopril ( 30 mg/kg per day ) or a vehicle orally for 24 days from the day of monocrotaline injection . At day 25 , echocardiography was performed and hearts were excised . Expressions and activities of P08253 and P14780 were measured by Western blotting and by gelatin zymography , respectively . In monocrotaline-injected rats , right ventricular weight/tail length ratio increased significantly . Histological analysis revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in right ventricular sections . Echocardiography showed right ventricular dysfunction compared with saline-injected rats . The right ventricular hypertrophy , fibrosis , and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril . However , captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure . P08253 and P14780 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them . These findings indicate that captopril attenuates the development of monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy in association with inhibition of P08253 and P14780 in rats .
