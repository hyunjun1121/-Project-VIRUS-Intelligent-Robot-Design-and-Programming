P43119 up-regulates the expression of angiogenic genes in human endometrium via cross talk with epidermal growth factor Receptor and the extracellular signaling receptor kinase 1/2 pathway . DB01240 ( P06744 ) is a member of the prostanoid family of lipid mediators that mediates its effects through a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor ( IP receptor ) . Recent studies have ascertained a role for prostanoid-receptor signaling in angiogenesis . In this study we examined the temporal-spatial expression of the IP receptor within normal human endometrium and additionally explored the signaling pathways mediating the role of IP receptor in activation of target angiogenic genes . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the highest endometrial expression of the IP receptor during the menstrual phase compared with all other stages of the menstrual cycle . Immunohistochemical analysis localized the site of IP receptor expression to the glandular epithelial compartment with stromal and perivascular cell immunoreactivity . Expression of the immunoreactive IP receptor protein was greatest during the proliferative and early secretory phases of the menstrual cycle . To explore the role of the IP receptor in glandular epithelial cells , we used the Ishikawa endometrial epithelial cell line . Stimulation of Ishikawa cells and human endometrial biopsy explants with 100 nm iloprost ( a P06744 analog ) rapidly activated P27361 /2 signaling and induced the expression of proangiogenic genes , basic fibroblast growth factor , angiopoietin-1 , and angiopoietin-2 , in an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) -dependent manner . Furthermore , P00533 colocalized with IP receptor in the glandular epithelial compartment . These data suggest that P06744 -IP interaction within glandular epithelial cells can promote the expression of proangiogenic genes in human endometrium via cross talk with the P00533 .
