Raddeanin A , a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Anemone raddeana , suppresses the angiogenesis and growth of human colorectal tumor by inhibiting P35968 signaling . Raddeanin A ( RA ) is an active triterpenoid saponin from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb , Anemone raddeana Regel . It was previously reported that RA possessed attractive antitumor activity through inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of multiple cancer cells . However , whether RA can inhibit angiogenesis , an essential step in cancer development , remains unknown . In this study , we found that RA could significantly inhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) proliferation , motility , migration , and tube formation . RA also dramatically reduced angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) , restrained the trunk angiogenesis in zebrafish , and suppressed angiogenesis and growth of human HCT-15 colorectal cancer xenograft in mice . Western blot assay showed that RA suppressed P15692 -induced phosphorylation of P35968 and its downstream protein kinases including PLCÎ³1 , O60674 , Q05397 , Src , and Akt . Molecular docking simulation indicated that RA formed hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions within the DB00171 binding pocket of P35968 kinase domain . Our study firstly provides the evidence that RA has high antiangiogenic potency and explores its molecular basis , demonstrating that RA is a potential agent or lead candidate for antiangiogenic cancer therapy .
