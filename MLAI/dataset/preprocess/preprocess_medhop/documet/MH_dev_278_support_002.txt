DB00140 ( vitamin B2 ) deficiency impairs P04839 ( Nox2 ) priming and defense against Listeria monocytogenes . DB00140 , also known as vitamin B2 , is converted by riboflavin kinase ( Q969G6 ) into flavin mononucleotide ( Q68DA7 ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide ( DB03147 ) , which are essential cofactors of dehydrogenases , reductases , and oxidases including the phagocytic P04839 ( Nox2 ) . DB00140 deficiency is common in young adults and elderly individuals , who are at the coincidental risk for listeriosis . To address the impact of acute riboflavin deficiency on host defense against Listeria monocytogenes ( L.m. ) , we generated conditional Q969G6 knockout ( KO ) strains of mice . Phagocyte-specific Q969G6 KO impaired the capability of phagocytes to control intracellular L.m. , which corresponded to a greater susceptibility of mice to in vivo challenge with L.m . The oxidative burst of Q969G6 -deficient phagocytes in response to L.m. infection was significantly reduced . Mechanistically , P01375 -induced priming of Nox2 , which is needed for oxidative burst , was defective in Q969G6 -deficient phagocytes . Lack of riboflavin in wild-type macrophages for only 6 h shut down P01375 -induced , Q969G6 -mediated de novo Q68DA7 / DB03147 generation , which was accompanied by diminished ROS production and impaired anti-listerial activity . Vice versa , ROS production by riboflavin-deprived macrophages was rapidly restored by riboflavin supplementation . Our results suggest that acute riboflavin deficiency immediately impairs priming of Nox2 , which is of crucial relevance for an effective phagocytic immune response in vivo .
