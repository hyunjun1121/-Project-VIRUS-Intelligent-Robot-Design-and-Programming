DB00428 -induced increase in cholesterol ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) and its reversal by insulin in transgenic mice expressing human P11597 . High plasma triacylglycerol and low high-density lipoprotein levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease in diabetes . Plasma high-density lipoprotein levels are regulated by cholesterol ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) . The regulation of P11597 under diabetic conditions is not clear , and this is due to a lack of appropriate models . We used transgenic mice expressing human P11597 to study the regulation of this protein under type-1 diabetic conditions and further investigated whether insulin reverses the effect of diabetes . Mice expressing human P11597 under the control of its natural flanking region and age-matched littermates not expressing this protein were made diabetic by injecting streptozotocin , and the reversal of diabetes was assessed by injecting insulin . The plasma total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol , and triacylglycerol concentrations were elevated , whereas high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations were reduced after the onset of diabetes . P01308 injection partially recovered this effect . The plasma cholesterol ester transfer activity , P11597 mass , and hepatic P11597 mRNA abundance were significantly higher in diabetic mice that were partially restored by insulin administration . There was a strong correlation between high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol ester transfer activity . These results suggest that an increase in P11597 under diabetic conditions might be a major factor responsible for increased incidence of diabetes-induced atherosclerosis .
