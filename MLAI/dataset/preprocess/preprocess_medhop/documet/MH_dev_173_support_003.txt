DB11320 inhibits differentiation of skin fibroblasts into myofibroblasts . DB11320 and TGF-β , major mediators secreted by mast cells , are involved in skin inflammation and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis . However , the roles of signaling mechanisms in the development of skin fibrosis remain largely unclear . Here we show that histamine suppressed the expression of α smooth muscle actin ( αSMA ) , a marker of myofibroblasts , induced by TGF-β1 in skin fibroblasts . DB11320 H1-receptor ( P35367 ) , but not H2-receptor ( P25021 ) or H4-receptor ( Q9H3N8 ) , was expressed on skin fibroblasts at both mRNA and protein levels . Interestingly , an P35367 antagonist , but not P25021 or Q9H3N8 antagonists , antagonized the histamine-mediated suppression of αSMA expression by TGF-β1 . Correspondingly , phosphorylated Q15796 was detected after treatment with TGF-β1 , whereas the addition of histamine inhibited this phosphorylation . Taken together , histamine- P35367 decreased TGF-β1-mediated Q15796 phosphorylation and inhibited differentiation of skin fibroblasts into myofibroblasts .
