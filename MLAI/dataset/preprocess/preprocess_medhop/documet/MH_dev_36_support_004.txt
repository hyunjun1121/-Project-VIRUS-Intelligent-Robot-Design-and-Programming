A genomic insight into diversity among tribal and nontribal population groups of Manipur , India . Twenty autosomal markers , including linked markers at two gene markers , are used to understand the genomic similarity and diversity among three tribal ( Paite , Thadou , and Kom ) and one nontribal communities of Manipur ( Northeast India ) . Two of the markers ( P01730 and HB9 ) are monomorphic in Paite and one ( the P01730 marker ) in Kom . Data suggest the Meitei ( nontribal groups ) stand apart from the three tribal groups with respect to higher heterozygosity ( 0.366 ) and presence of the highest ancestor haplotypes of P14416 markers ( 0.228 ) ; this is also supported by principal co-ordinate analysis . These populations are found to be genomically closer to the Chinese population than to other Indian populations .
