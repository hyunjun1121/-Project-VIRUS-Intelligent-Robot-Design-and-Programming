A new mechanism of drug resistance in breast cancer cells : fatty acid synthase overexpression-mediated palmitate overproduction . Multidrug resistance is a major problem in successful cancer chemotherapy . Various mechanisms of resistance , such as ABC transporter-mediated drug efflux , have been discovered using established model cancer cell lines . While characterizing a drug-resistant breast cancer cell line , MCF7/AdVp3000 , we found that fatty acid synthase ( P49327 ) is overexpressed . In this study , we showed that ectopic overexpression of P49327 indeed causes drug resistance and that reducing the P49327 expression increased the drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 but not in the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A1 . Use of P49327 inhibitor , DB01083 , at low concentrations also sensitized cells with P49327 overexpression to anticancer drugs . The P49327 -mediated drug resistance appears to be due to a decrease in drug-induced apoptosis from an overproduction of palmitic acid by P49327 . Together with previous findings of P49327 as a poor prognosis marker for breast cancer patients , our results suggest that P49327 overexpression is a new mechanism of drug resistance and may be an ideal target for chemosensitization in breast cancer chemotherapy .
