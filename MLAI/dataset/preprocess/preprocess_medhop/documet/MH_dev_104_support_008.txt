P43119 in tumor endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis in an autocrine manner . Molecules highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells ( TEC ) are important for specific targeting of these cells . Previously , using DNA microarray analysis , we found that the prostacyclin receptor ( IP receptor ) gene was upregulated in TEC compared with normal endothelial cells ( NEC ) . Although prostacyclin is implicated in re-endothelialization and angiogenesis , its role remains largely unknown in TEC . Moreover , the effect of the IP receptor on TEC has not been reported . In the present study we investigated the function of the IP receptor in TEC . The TEC were isolated from two types of human tumor xenografts in nude mice , while NEC were isolated from normal counterparts . DB01240 secretion levels in TEC were significantly higher than those in NEC , as shown using ELISA . Real-time RT-PCR showed that the IP receptor was upregulated in TEC compared with NEC . Furthermore , migration and tube formation of TEC were suppressed by the IP receptor antagonist RO1138452 . Immunohistostaining showed that the IP receptor was specifically expressed in blood vessels of renal cell carcinoma specimens , but not in glomerular vessels of normal renal tissue . These findings suggest that the IP receptor is a TEC-specific marker and might be a useful therapeutic target .
