A randomized , placebo-controlled study of the effects of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB- DB05250 on blood biomarkers of inflammation in P48444 patients . The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling upregulates inflammation and is known to be increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . The authors assessed the pharmacology of the novel p38 MAPK inhibitor SB- DB05250 using blood biomarkers in P48444 . Seventeen P48444 patients ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second 50 % -80 % predicted ) using short-acting bronchodilators participated in a double-blind , double-dummy , randomized , crossover study . Patients received single oral doses of SB- DB05250 7.5 mg and 25 mg , prednisolone 10 mg and 30 mg , and placebo . Blood was obtained predose and at 1 , 2 , 6 , and 24 hours postdose . Whole-blood sorbitol-induced phosphorylated ( p ) heat shock protein ( HSP ) 27 levels as a marker of p38 pathway activation and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production were assessed . Both doses of SB- DB05250 , but not prednisolone , significantly ( P < .0001 ) reduced weighted mean ( WM ) pHSP27 ( 0-6 hours ) by 58 % compared with placebo . WM P01375 production ( 0-24 hours ) was significantly reduced compared with placebo by SB- DB05250 25 mg ( 40 % , P = .005 ) and 7.5 mg ( 33.4 % , P = .02 ) , while prednisolone 30 mg and 10 mg caused 81.5 % and 58.2 % suppression , respectively ( both P < .0001 ) . SB- DB05250 inhibited the p38 MAPK pathway to a greater degree than prednisolone did . SB- DB05250 inhibited P01375 production . SB- DB05250 is a potent p38 MAPK inhibitor that potentially suppresses inflammation in P48444 .
