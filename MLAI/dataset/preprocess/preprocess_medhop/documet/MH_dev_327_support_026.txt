P07550 -mediated effects on sinus rate and atrial and ventricular contractility on isolated , blood-perfused dog heart preparations . Changes in the sinus rate , right atrial contractile force and left ventricular contractile force in response to isoproterenol , epinephrine , dobutamine , salbutamol and procaterol were studied in isolated , blood-perfused right atrial or left ventricular cardiac preparations of the dog . Each substance elicited dose-dependent increases in the three parameters and the ranking of the potency ( ED50 ) for each effect was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than dobutamine greater than or equal to salbutamol greater than or equal to procaterol . The ED50 of procaterol for changing sinus rate was lower than for altering atrial and ventricular contractile force , whereas the ED50 of dobutamine for changing sinus rate was higher . Ranking on the basis of the ratio of increase in sinus rate to increase in atrial tension induced by the agonists gave the following order : procaterol greater than or equal to salbutamol greater than epinephrine greater than or equal to isoproterenol greater than dobutamine . DB01366 -induced increases in sinus rate and atrial contractile force were dose-dependently inhibited by the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist , ICI 118,551 , but only attenuated slightly by the beta-1 antagonist , atenolol . On the other hand , the positive chrono- and inotropic effects on the right atrium induced by dobutamine and isoproterenol were blocked completely by atenolol . The epinephrine- or salbutamol-induced positive chrono- and inotropic responses in the right atrium were inhibited moderately by both antagonists , but ICI 118,551 inhibited sinus rate increases more effectively than the atrial tension increases.
