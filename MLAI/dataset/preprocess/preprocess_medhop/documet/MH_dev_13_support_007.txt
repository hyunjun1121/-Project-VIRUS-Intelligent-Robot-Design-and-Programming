Potent and selective activation of the pancreatic beta-cell type K( DB00171 ) channel by two novel diazoxide analogues . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : We investigated the pharmacological properties of two novel DB00171 sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channel openers , 6-Chloro-3-isopropylamino-4 H-thieno [ 3,2- e ] -1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide ( NNC 55-0118 ) and 6-chloro-3-(1-methylcyclopropyl)amino-4 H-thieno[3,2-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide ( NN414 ) , on the cloned cardiac ( Kir6.2/SUR2A ) , smooth muscle ( Kir6.2/SUR2B ) and pancreatic beta cell ( Kir6.2/ Q09428 ) types of K( DB00171 ) channel . METHODS : We studied the effects of these compounds on whole-cell currents through cloned K( DB00171 ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells ( HEK293 ) . We also used inside-out macropatches excised from Xenopus oocytes . RESULTS : In P29320 293 cells , NNC 55-0118 and NN414 activated Kir6.2/ Q09428 currents with EC(50) values of 0.33 micromol/l and 0.45 micromol/l , respectively , compared with that of 31 micro mol/l for diazoxide . Neither compound activated Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B channels expressed in oocytes , nor did they activate Kir6.2 expressed in the absence of Q09428 . Current activation was dependent on the presence of intracellular MgATP , but was not supported by MgADP . CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION : Both NNC 55-0118 and NN414 selectively stimulate the pancreatic beta-cell type of K( DB00171 ) channel with a higher potency than diazoxide , by interaction with the Q09428 subunit . The high selectivity and efficacy of the compounds could prove useful for treatment of disease states where inhibition of insulin secretion is beneficial .
