Gene expression analysis of troglitazone reveals its impact on multiple pathways in cell culture : a case for in vitro platforms combined with gene expression analysis for early ( idiosyncratic ) toxicity screening . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) agonists of the thiazolidinedione family are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to their ability to reduce glucose and lipid levels in patients with this disease . Three thiazolidinediones that were approved for treatment are Rezulin ( troglitazone ) , Avandia ( rosiglitazone ) , and Actos ( pioglitazone ) . DB00197 was withdrawn from the market due to idiosyncratic drug toxicity . Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are still on the market for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . The authors present data from a gene expression screen that compares the impact these three compounds have in rats , in rat hepatocytes , and in the clone 9 rat liver cell line . The authors monitored the changes in expression in multiple genes , including those related to xenobiotic metabolism , proliferation , DNA damage , oxidative stress , apoptosis , and inflammation . Compared to the other two compounds , troglitazone had a significant impact on many of the pathways monitored in vitro although no major perturbation was detected in vivo . The changes detected predict not only general toxicity but potential mechanisms of toxicity . Based on gene expression analysis , the authors propose there is not just one but multiple ways troglitazone could be toxic , depending on a patient 's environment and genetic makeup , including immune response-related toxicity .
