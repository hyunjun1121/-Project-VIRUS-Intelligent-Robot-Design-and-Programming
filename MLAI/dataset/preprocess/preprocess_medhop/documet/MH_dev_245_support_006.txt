Association of P35462 and Q13224 with impulse control and related behaviors in Parkinson 's disease . We aimed to assess whether allelic variants of dopamine receptor , glutamate receptor , and serotonin transporter genes are associated with the appearance of impulse control and related behaviors ( ICRB ) in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) with dopamine replacement therapy ( P29323 ) . We surveyed ICRB in consecutive Korean patients with PD who were treated with stable P29323 using modified Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview over a period of 4 months . In the 404 patients who completed the interview and the 559 Korean healthy normal controls , genotyping was performed for variants of the P35462 p.S9G , P14416 Taq1A , Q13224 c.366C > G , c.2664C > T and c.-200T > G , and the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTTLPR ) . Behavioral abnormalities suggestive of ICRB including compulsive buying , gambling , sexual behavior and eating , and punding , were present in 14.4 % of the patients . Variants of P14416 and 5-HTTLPR were not associated with the risk of developing ICRB . However , the AA genotype of P35462 p.S9G and the CC genotype of Q13224 c.366C > G were more frequent in patients with ICRB than in nonaffected patients ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.21 , P = 0.0094 ; and 2.14 , P = 0.0087 , after adjusting for age and sex ) . After controlling for clinical variables in the multivariate analysis , carriage of either AA genotype of P35462 or CC genotype of Q13224 was identified as an independent risk factor for ICRB ( adjusted OR : 2.57 , P = 0.0087 ) . Variants of P35462 p.S9G and Q13224 c.366C > G may be associated with the appearance of ICRB in PD .
