A unique structure for epidermal growth factor receptor bound to GW572016 ( DB01259 ) : relationships among protein conformation , inhibitor off-rate , and receptor activity in tumor cells . GW572016 ( DB01259 ) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development for cancer that is a potent dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 , ErbB-1 ) and ErbB-2 . We determined the crystal structure of P00533 bound to GW572016 . The compound is bound to an inactive-like conformation of P00533 that is very different from the active-like structure bound by the selective P00533 inhibitor DB00530 ( Tarceva ) described previously . Surprisingly , we found that GW572016 has a very slow off-rate from the purified intracellular domains of P00533 and ErbB-2 compared with DB00530 and another P00533 selective inhibitor , ZD-1839 ( DB00317 ) . Treatment of tumor cells with these inhibitors results in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation . We evaluated the duration of the drug effect after washing away free compound and found that the rate of recovery of receptor phosphorylation in the tumor cells reflected the inhibitor off-rate from the purified intracellular domain . The slow off-rate of GW572016 correlates with a prolonged down-regulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells . The differences in the off-rates of these drugs and the ability of GW572016 to inhibit ErbB-2 can be explained by the enzyme-inhibitor structures .
