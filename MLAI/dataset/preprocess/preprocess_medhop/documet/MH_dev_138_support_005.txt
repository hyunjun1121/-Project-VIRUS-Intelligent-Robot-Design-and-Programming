Proangiogenesis action of the thyroid hormone analog 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid ( DITPA ) is initiated at the cell surface and is integrin mediated . We have recently described the proangiogenesis effects of thyroid hormone in the chick chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) model . Generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels was promoted 2- to 3-fold by either T(4) or T(3) at 10(-8)-10(-7) M total hormone concentrations . In the present studies , nanomolar concentrations of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid ( DITPA ) , a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotropic properties , exhibited potent proangiogenic activity that was comparable to that obtained with T(3) and T(4) in both the P62158 model and in an in vitro three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting assay . The proangiogenesis effect of DITPA was inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid , a thyroid hormone analog that competes with T(4) and T(3) for a novel cell surface hormone receptor site on integrin alphavbeta3 . The thyroid hormone analogs DITPA , T(4) , and T(4)-agarose , as well as basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor , demonstrated comparable proangiogenic effects in the P62158 model and in the three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting model . The proangiogenesis effect of either DITPA or b-FGF was blocked by PD 98059 , an inhibitor of the P27361 /2 signal transduction cascade . Additionally , a specific integrin alphavbeta3 small molecule antagonist , XT199 , effectively inhibited the proangiogenesis effect of DITPA and b-FGF . Thus , the proangiogenesis actions of thyroid hormone and its analog DITPA are initiated at the plasma membrane , apparently at integrin alphavbeta3 , and are MAPK dependent .
