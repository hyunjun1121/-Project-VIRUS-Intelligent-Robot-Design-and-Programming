Anti-inflammatory activities of mogrosides from Momordica grosvenori in murine macrophages and a murine ear edema model . Momordica grosvenori ( Luo Han DB02857 ) , grown primarily in Guangxi province in China , has been traditionally used for thousands of years by the Chinese to make hot drinks for the treatment of sore throat and the removal of phlegm . The natural noncaloric sweetening triterpenoid glycosides ( mogrosides ) contained in the M. grosvenori fruits are also antioxidative , anticarcinogenic , and helpful in preventing diabetic complications . The aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of mogrosides in both murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and a murine ear edema model . The results indicate that mogrosides can inhibit inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) in RAW 264.7 cells by down-regulating the expression of key inflammatory genes P35228 , P35354 , and P05231 and up-regulating some inflammation protective genes such as P09874 , BCL2l1 , TRP53 , and P45984 . Similarly , in the murine ear edema model , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced inflammation was inhibited by mogrosides by down-regulating P35354 and P05231 and up-regulating P09874 , BCL2l1 , TRP53 , P45984 , and PPARÎ´ gene expression . This study shows that the anticancer and antidiabetic effects of M. grosvenori may result in part from its anti-inflammatory activity .
