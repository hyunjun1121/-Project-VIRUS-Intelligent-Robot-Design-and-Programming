DB01370 alters iron and manganese uptake and regulation of surface transferrin receptors in primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures . P02787 ( Tf ) is a major transport protein for both iron ( Fe ) and aluminum ( Al ) , as well as manganese ( Mn ) and it can mediate cellular uptake of these elements via cell surface Tf receptors . To study the effect of Al-Tf on Tf receptor regulation , primary oligodendrocyte cultures were prepared from cortices of newborn rats . The effects of Al-Tf on 54Mn and 59Fe uptake were compared to those of apo- , Fe- , or Mn-Tf ( 1.25 microM ) . To examine changes in cell surface Tf binding capacity , preincubation ( 4 h , 37 degrees C ) was performed with apo- , Al- or Fe-Tf and homologous receptor binding studies were subsequently conducted with 125I-Fe-Tf at 4 degrees C . Incubation with Al-Tf , but not with equimolar amounts of Al chloride or Al citrate , led to dose-related increases in cellular Al . Incubation with either Al- or Fe-Tf decreased 59Fe uptake , while incubation with either Al- or Mn-Tf decreased 54Mn uptake . Surface Tf receptor sites/cell were 1.05 , 0.60 and 0.46 x 10(5) after incubations with equivalent amounts of apo- , Fe- , and Al-Tf respectively . The data suggest that Al-Tf down-regulates surface Tf receptors on oligodendrocytes and can limit Fe and Mn uptake through this mechanism .
