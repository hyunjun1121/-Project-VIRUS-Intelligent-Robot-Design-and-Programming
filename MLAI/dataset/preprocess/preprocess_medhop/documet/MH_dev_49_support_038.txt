Induction of apoptosis by a dominant negative H- DB01367 mutant ( 116Y ) in K562 cells . Recent extensive work on apoptosis has begun to reveal its molecular mechanisms . Several genes that regulate apoptosis have been identified . Among them , the P10415 gene is considered to be an important gene that inhibits apoptosis . However , there must be other genes , yet to be identified , which suppress apoptosis . It has been suggested that the activation of DB01367 function by P11274 - P00519 fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia may be an important mechanism in the P11274 - P00519 mediated transformation . Therefore , in this study we have investigated whether the suppression of endogenous H- DB01367 function inhibits the P11274 - P00519 mediated transforming activity in a K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line . The induced expression of a dominant negative v-H- DB01367 mutant ( 116Y ) in K562 cells has resulted in cell death . The morphological characteristics and the detection of fragmented DNA by gel electrophoresis in the dead cells have revealed that this cell death is apoptosis . These results directly indicate that the DB01367 gene as well as the P10415 gene has an ability to suppress apoptosis .
