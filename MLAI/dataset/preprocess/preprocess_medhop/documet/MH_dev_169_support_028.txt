The retrograde ventriculo-sinus shunt ( El Shafei RVS shunt ) . Rationale , evolution , surgical technique and long-term results . Since 1990 , 110 retrograde ventriculo-sinus ( RVS ) shunts were implanted ; 98 patients ( 89.1 % ) benefited - 1 of them ( 0.9 % ) after shunt revision . The manifestations of high intra cranial pressure ( ICP ) disappeared , there were no problems related to improper cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) drainage , and the transcranial Doppler ( P24386 ) resistive index ( RI ) measurements decreased to within normal ranges . Radiologically , the ventriculomegaly showed no regression in patients with open craniums and variable degrees of mild regression in patients with rigid craniums . Complications that needed shunt removal or revision occurred in 13 patients ( 11.8 % ) ; 1 patient ( 0.9 % ) died before shunt revision ; they were all due to technical errors committed during the stages of evolution of the surgical technique for shunt implantation . The follow-up ranged between 4 months and 11 years ( mean 3.42 years ) . CONCLUSION : the RVS shunt is a simple , minimally invasive , physiological procedure for treatment of hydrocephalus and is suitable for all ages .
