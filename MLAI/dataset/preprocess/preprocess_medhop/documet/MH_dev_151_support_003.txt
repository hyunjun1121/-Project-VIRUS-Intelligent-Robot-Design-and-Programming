Human epidermal Langerhans ' cells are targets for the immunosuppressive macrolide tacrolimus ( FK506 ) . BACKGROUND : The immunosuppressive macrolide tacrolimus ( FK506 ) has been shown to inhibit allergic contact dermatitis in animal models as well as in human beings . More recently , successful treatment of atopic dermatitis with an ointment containing tacrolimus has been reported . OBJECTIVES : We explored the effects of this compound on epidermal Langerhans ' cells ( LCs ) , which are known to play an important pathophysiologic role in inflammatory skin diseases . METHODS : The expression of the intracellular FK506 binding protein ( P62942 ) was monitored on freshly isolated and cultured epidermal LCs . Phenotyping and functional exploration of LCs treated with different concentrations of tacrolimus and beta-methasone valerate ( betaMv ) were performed . RESULTS : P62942 is expressed in freshly isolated LCs but is lost while they are maturating into mature dendritic cells . DB00864 inhibited the expression of IL-2R ( CD25 ) and of the costimulatory molecules P33681 ( P33681 .1 ) and P25942 . Expression of MHC class I and II was also affected , whereas P42081 ( P33681 .2 ) expression was not altered . In contrast , betaMv strongly increased the expression of CD25 . Paradoxically , while decreasing P25942 and MHC class I expression , betaMv significantly increased the expression of MHC class II , P33681 , and P42081 on cultured LCs but impaired their allostimulatory activity . DB00864 was about 100 times more potent than betaMv at inhibiting LC stimulatory function . CONCLUSION : DB00864 can exert immunopharmacologic alterations on LCs , which may account , at least in part , for the therapeutic effect of this compound in eczematous skin diseases .
