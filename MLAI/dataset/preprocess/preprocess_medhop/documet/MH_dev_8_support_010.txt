Blocking both type A and B endothelin receptors in the kidney attenuates renal injury and prolongs survival in rats with remnant kidney . Renal disease progression in the rat is associated with a time-dependent upregulation of renal endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) gene expression and synthesis . We have previously demonstrated that endothelin A receptor subtype ( P25101 ) blockade in rats with remnant kidney reduced signs of disease activity , suggesting that ET-1 exerts part of its deleterious effects on the kidney through P25101 . No data are available so far on the role of ETB receptor in progressive renal injury . We first studied renal P25101 and ETB receptor gene expression in rats with remnant kidney on days 7 , 30 , and 120 after the surgical procedure . While renal expression of P25101 was unaffected , ETB receptor gene was significantly upregulated with time in rats with remnant kidney , being 3.5-fold and sixfold higher than shamoperated rats at days 30 and 120 . We also evaluated whether DB00559 , a nonpeptidic P25101 and ETB receptor antagonist , offered better protection against renal disease progression than reported for P25101 -selective blockers and whether it improved survival in animals with renal ablation . Two groups of rats with renal mass reduction ( n = 11 each ) were given DB00559 100 mg/kg/d orally or its vehicle ( carboxymethyl cellulose ) beginning day 7 after the surgical procedure and were followed until the death of the vehicle-treated animals . Sham-operated animals comprised the control group . DB00559 partially prevented increases in blood pressure and proteinuria , but had a remarkable protective effect on renal function and significantly prolonged animal survival . These data suggest that blocking both renal P25101 and ETB receptors might have major implications in the treatment of human progressive nephropathies .
