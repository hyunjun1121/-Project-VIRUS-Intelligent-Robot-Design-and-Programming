A multi-analyte assay for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer . Accurate urinary assays for bladder cancer ( BCa ) detection would benefit both patients and healthcare systems . Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine components , we have previously identified a panel of biomarkers that can outperform current urine-based biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of BCa . Herein , we report the diagnostic utility of various multivariate combinations of these biomarkers . We performed a case-controlled validation study in which voided urines from 127 patients ( 64 tumor bearing subjects ) were analyzed . The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers ( P10145 , P14780 , P09238 , P18827 , P55774 , P05121 , P16070 , P15692 , P03950 , Q16790 , A1AT , P10451 , PTX3 , and P02649 ) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test . An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis ( sensitivity 92 % , specificity 97 % ) , but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers ( P10145 , P15692 , and P02649 ) was also highly accurate ( sensitivity 90 % , specificity 97 % ) . For comparison , the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79 % and a specificity of 83 % , and voided urine cytology detected only 33 % of BCa cases in the same cohort . These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection . Further validation studies are under way to investigate the clinical utility of this panel of biomarkers for BCa diagnosis and disease monitoring .
