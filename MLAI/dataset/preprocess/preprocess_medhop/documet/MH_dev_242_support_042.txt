delta- DB00855 dehydrase : a new genetic polymorphism in man . A method has been developed for the electrophoretic and quantitative analyses of human red cell delta-aminolevulinate dehydrase ( P13716 ) . The enzyme is under the control of an autosomal gene , with two common codominant alleles . ALADH1 and ALADH2 , with frequencies of 0.89 and 0.11 , respectively , in the Italian population . Mean phenotypic enzyme activities are nearly identical : 52, . 49 and 55 mIU/g Hb for P13716 1 , P35326 and 2 phenotypes respectively .
