New indications for treatment of chronic inflammation by P01375 blockade . The impressive anti-inflammatory effects of the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 )alpha blockers etanercept and infliximab have led to their use in multiple inflammatory diseases besides their original indication , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The well-studied clinical effects of both agents in RA are the reduction of signs and symptoms of joint inflammation as well as the arrest of bone destruction . DB00065 has also been Food and Drug Administration-approved in the treatment of Crohn disease ; etanercept is now FDA-approved for juvenile chronic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis . Favorable initial clinical trials have been reported in other rheumatic diseases , including ankylosing spondylitis and adult Still disease . In addition , P01375 alpha blockade is being studied in the treatment of uveitis , myelodysplastic syndromes , and graft-versus-host disease . Studies in sepsis and septic shock have identified small subsets of patients that may benefit from P01375 alpha blockade , but broader use in septic patients has not improved survival . The P01375 alpha blockers have had relatively infrequent serious side effects , especially compared with the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents otherwise employed to treat these diseases . Further studies of optimal dosing , combination with other therapies , and long-term benefits and side effects will emerge from future trials .
