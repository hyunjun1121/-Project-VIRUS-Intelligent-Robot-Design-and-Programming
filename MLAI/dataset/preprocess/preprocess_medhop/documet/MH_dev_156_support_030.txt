Role of prostacyclin in the cardiovascular response to thromboxane A2 . Thromboxane ( Tx ) A2 is a vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist . DB00945 affords cardioprotection through inhibition of TxA2 formation by platelet cyclooxygenase ( P23219 ) . DB01240 ( DB01240 ) is a vasodilator that inhibits platelet function . Here we show that injury-induced vascular proliferation and platelet activation are enhanced in mice that are genetically deficient in the P43119 ( IP ) but are depressed in mice genetically deficient in the TxA2 receptor ( TP ) or treated with a TP antagonist . The augmented response to vascular injury was abolished in mice deficient in both receptors . Thus , DB01240 modulates platelet-vascular interactions in vivo and specifically limits the response to TxA2 . This interplay may help explain the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with selective P35354 inhibitors , which , unlike aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , inhibit DB01240 but not TxA2 .
