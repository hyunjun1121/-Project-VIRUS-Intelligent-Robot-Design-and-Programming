Activation of c-fos by lipopolysaccharide in glial cells via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation of serum or cyclic AMP/calcium response element . Pathological conditions such as ischaemic stroke and inflammatory disorders cause c-fos activation in the brain . This activation contributes to the initiation of the brain 's inflammatory response , orchestrated by activated glial cells . The inflammatory signalling cascades leading to c-fos activation in glial cells are not well characterized . Thus , we have attempted a detailed analysis of the cis-acting elements , transcription factors and upstream kinase pathways involved in the activation of c-fos by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in primary rat cortical glial cells . We found that ( 1 ) LPS-induced c-fos mRNA levels were sensitive to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibitors but not to mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitors , ( 2 ) LPS activated both serum response element ( SRE ) and cyclic AMP/calcium response element ( CRE ) -driven luciferase reporters in transient transfection assays , ( 3 ) LPS induced the phosphorylation of Elk1 CRE-binding protein ( CREB ) /activated transcription factor-1 ( P39905 -1 ) and the activation of GAL4-Elk1 and GAL4-CREB chimeric proteins , and ( 4 ) mutation of both SRE and CRE elements was necessary and sufficient to completely abolish LPS induction of a rat c-fos proximal promoter-luciferase reporter . Thus , c-fos activation by LPS in glial cells occurs via the SRE or CRE in an independent manner , and involves the Elk1 or CREB/ P39905 -1 transcription factors . Elk1-mediated transactivation was dependent on p38 MAPK , suggesting a crucial role of these factors in mediating inflammatory responses in the CNS .
