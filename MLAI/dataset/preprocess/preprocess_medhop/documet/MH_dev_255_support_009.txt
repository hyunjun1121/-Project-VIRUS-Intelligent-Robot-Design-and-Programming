Combined effect of oxidative stress-related gene polymorphisms on atherosclerosis . It is well known that oxidative stress plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . In this study , we enrolled 1746 type 2 diabetic subjects , determined 4 common genetic variants related to oxidative stress ( glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit ( P48507 ) C-588T , myeloperoxidase G-463A , human paraoxonase 1 Gln192Arg and NAD(P)H oxidase P13498 C242T polymorphisms ) , and measured carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) as a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis . P48507 C-588T polymorphism was associated with average IMT ( AveIMT ) ( r=0.090 , p=0.0008 ) , but the association between the other 3 polymorphisms and AveIMT did not reach the statistical significance . However , AveIMT was significantly greater as the total number of 4 concomitant " pro-oxidant alleles " in each subject was increased ( r=0.108 , p < 0.0001 ) . Furthermore , the number of " pro-oxidant alleles " was a risk factor for a high AveIMT independently of conventional risk factors ( p=0.0003 ) . In conclusion , accumulation of oxidative stress-associated alleles was associated with carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients .
