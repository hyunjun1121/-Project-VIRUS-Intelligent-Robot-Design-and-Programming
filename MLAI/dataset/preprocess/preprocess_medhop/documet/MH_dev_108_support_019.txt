Emerging drugs for the treatment of axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis . INTRODUCTION : The topic under discussion is of strong relevance to the field of spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) because , in addition to established biological , there are new promising compounds . The reason for the review is to put all available data together to allow for an overview on recent developments and to especially inform readers about emerging drugs , biologics and small molecules in the field of SpA . AREAS COVERED : This review on new therapies in axial and peripheral SpA comprising psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) shows , that , in addition to the established anti- P01375 agents infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , DB06674 , certolizumab and the first biosimilar approved in the EU , there are at least two emerging biologics in the field of SpA : ustekinumab , a compound targeting IL12/IL-23 via the p40 subunit of both cytokines works for psoriasis and PsA and probably also for Crohn 's disease , and the anti- Q16552 antibody secukinumab which has also been shown to work in psoriasis , both compounds seem to also work in ankylosing spondylitis . In addition , the potential of two small molecules , apremilast a phoshodiesterase4 inhibitor and tofacitinib , a januskinase inhibitor is discussed . EXPERT OPINION : Since , in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis , the therapeutic array in SpA is currently limited to P01375 -blockers , and since there is still an unmet need because some patients do not respond to anti- P01375 therapy at all or they loose response , new agents with a different mechanism of action are eagerly awaited .
