Anti- P04626 cancer therapy and cardiotoxicity . A significant milestone in the treatment of breast cancer is the identification of the P04626 receptor as a drug target for cancer therapies . DB00072 ( Herceptin ) , a monoclonal antibody that blocks the P04626 receptor , is among the first of such drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for targeted cancer therapy . Clinical studies have shown that DB00072 significantly improves the overall survival of breast cancer patients . However , an unforeseen significant side-effect of cardiotoxicity manifested as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure . Concurrent studies have demonstrated the essential role of the P04626 receptor in cardiac development and maintaining the physiological function of an adult heart . The P04626 receptor , therefore , has become a critical link between the oncology and cardiology fields . In addition to DB00072 , new drugs targeting the P04626 receptor , such as DB01259 , DB06366 and DB08916 , are either approved or being evaluated in clinical trials for cancer therapy . With the concern of cardiotoxicity caused by P04626 inhibition , it becomes clear that new therapeutic strategies for preventing such cardiac side effects need to be developed . It is the intent of this paper to review the potential cardiac impact of anti- P04626 cancer therapy .
