P10997 -driven metabolic reprogramming induces regression of p53-deficient tumours in vivo . P04637 is commonly altered in human cancer , and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours in vivo in mice ( P04637 and Tp53 are also known as p53 ) . This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically , and here we examine an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members , Tp63 and Tp73 ( also known as p63 and p73 , respectively ) . The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing ( TA ) isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53 , whereas the ΔN isoforms ( lacking the acidic transactivation domain ) of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative fashion against p53 , TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive functions . The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that promote tumour suppression , such as apoptosis and autophagy , thus a clear understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the p53 pathway . Here we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient tumours through upregulation of P10997 , the gene that encodes amylin , a 37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the β cells of the pancreas . We found that P10997 is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor ( CalcR ) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 ( O60896 ) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and apoptosis . DB01278 , a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes , caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient thymic lymphomas , representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers .
