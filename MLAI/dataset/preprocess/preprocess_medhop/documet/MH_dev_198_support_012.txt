O14777 binds to the seventh regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome and modulates the proteolysis of mitotic cyclins . A newly identified nuclear protein rich in leucine heptad repeats called O14777 is important for mitosis . To elucidate its mechanism of action , the region containing leucine heptad repeats was used to identify cellular proteins that potentially interact with O14777 . Complementary DNAs encoding several proteins including P35998 , P29466 , Nek2 , and Smc1/Smc2 , known to be important for G2/M progression , were identified . The interaction between O14777 and P35998 , the seventh regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome , was further demonstrated by in vitro Q86UG4 pull-down assays . O14777 is not a part of the 26 S proteasome and interacts with P35998 only when it is dissociated from the complex during M phase . Purified P35998 specifically hydrolyzes DB00171 , an activity inhibited by O14777 . In addition , O14777 inhibits the proteolysis of mitotic cyclin B in vitro . Consistent with this biochemical activity , ectopic expression of O14777 inhibits the degradation of mitotic cyclins after telophase , resulting eventually in cell death . These results show that O14777 is a negative regulator of P35998 and suggest that it may modulate M phase progression , in part , through the regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins .
