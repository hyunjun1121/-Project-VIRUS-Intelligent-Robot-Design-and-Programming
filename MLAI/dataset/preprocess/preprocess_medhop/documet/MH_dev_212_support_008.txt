A dose ranging phase I/II trial of the P04275 inhibiting aptamer DB05202 in patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) is a very rare but potentially life-threatening disorder . This phase I/II trial compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and safety of three different administration modes of the anti- P04275 ( P04275 ) aptamer DB05202 . This was a prospective clinical trial with a partial cross-over design : three periods comprised subcutaneous injections of 50 mg of DB05202 on seven subsequent days , a low-dose infusion of DB05202 ( 0.002 mg/kg/min ) for 24-72 hours and a high-dose infusion ( 0.004-0.006 mg/kg/min ) up to 72 hours . DB05202 concentrations were determined with high performance liquid chromatography , P04275 inhibition was measured with enzyme immunoassay and platelet function was determined with the platelet function analyser ( PFA-100 ) and impedance aggregometry . DB05202 was well tolerated without any bleeding at concentrations spanning over three orders of magnitude . The daily s.c. injection yielded plasma levels ( 0.5 μg/ml ) of the drug that were too low to sufficiently suppress P04275 . The low-dose i.v. infusion increased platelet counts in one patient , whereas the high i.v. dose increased plasma concentrations up to 69 μg/ml , completely blocked free A1 domains , P04275 -dependent platelet plug formation and enhanced platelet counts in 2/3 patients . In conclusion , infusion of DB05202 dose-dependently inhibits P04275 -dependent platelet function and during infusion DB05202 increases or stabilises platelet counts in congenital TTP . However , the tested doses , particularly the daily s.c. injections , did not correct all clinical or laboratory features of TTP .
