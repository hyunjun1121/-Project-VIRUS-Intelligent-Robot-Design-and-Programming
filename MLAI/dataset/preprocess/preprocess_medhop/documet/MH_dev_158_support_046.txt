The influence of costimulation and regulatory P01730 + T cells on intestinal IgA immune responses . It is thought that IgA B-cell differentiation is highly dependent on activated P01730 + T cells . In particular , cell-cell interactions in the Peyer 's patches involving P25942 and/or P33681 / P42081 have been implicated in germinal-center formation and IgA B-cell development . Also soluble factors , such as P05112 , P05113 , P05231 , and TGF beta may be critical for IgA B-cell differentiation in vivo . Here we report on some paradoxical findings with regard to IgA B-cell differentiation and specific mucosal immune responses that we have recently made using gene knockout mice . More specifically , we have investigated to what extent absence of P01730 + T cells , relevant cytokines , or T-cell-B-cell interactions would influence IgA B-cell differentiation in vivo . Using P01730 - or P05112 -gene knockout mice or mice made transgenic for DB01281 , we found that , although specific responses were impaired , total IgA production and IgA B-cell differentiation appeared to proceed normally . However , a poor correlation was found between , on the one hand , GC formation and IgA differentiation and , on the other hand , the ability to respond to T-cell-dependent soluble protein antigens in these mice . Thus , despite the various deficiencies in P01730 + T-cell functions seemingly intact IgA B-cell development was observed .
