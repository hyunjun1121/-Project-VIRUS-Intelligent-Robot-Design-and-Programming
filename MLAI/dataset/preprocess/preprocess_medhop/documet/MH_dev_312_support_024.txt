The efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV type 1-infected patients treated in Curaçao compared with Antillean , Surinam , and Dutch HIV type 1-infected patients treated in The Netherlands . We compared the efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) of Antillean HIV-1-infected patients treated on the Caribbean island of Curaçao ( CUR-AN ) with Antillean ( NL-AN ) , Surinam ( NL- Q09428 ) , and Dutch ( NL-NL ) patients treated in The Netherlands . In total 2118 therapy-naive patients who started cART between January 2005 and August 2008 were included in the comparison . The CUR-AN patients initiated cART at a median P01730 cell count of 141 cells/mm(3) and 63 % had counts below 200 cells/mm(3) . Within 12 months of the start of cART 76 % of the CUR-AN patients achieved viral suppression , defined as HIV-1 RNA plasma levels below 80 copies/ml . The percentage achieving viral suppression was higher in patients treated in The Netherlands ( NL-AN = 87 % , NL- Q09428 = 93 % , and NL-NL = 96 % ) . Lost to follow-up after 30 months of cART was 10 % among CUR-AN patients and was higher than observed among patients treated in The Netherlands ( NL-AN = 8 % , NL- Q09428 = 3 % , and NL-NL = 2 % ) . A similar pattern was found for progression to AIDS and death ( 10 % of CUR-AN vs. 5 % , 6 % , and 7 % of NL-AN , NL- Q09428 , and NL-NL patients , respectively ) . Late start of cART and limited viral suppression after the start of cART determine the higher rate of disease progression to AIDS and death among Antillean patients treated in Curaçao . The high percentage of lost to follow-up may result in an underestimation of AIDS and AIDS-related death among HIV-1-infected Antilleans treated in Curaçao .
