Somatostatin analogues inhibit cancer cell proliferation in an P30874 -dependent manner via both cytostatic and cytotoxic pathways . Somatostatin receptors ( SSTRs ) are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in normal and cancer cells . Somatostatins ( P61278 ) are the natural ligands for SSTRs and act as inhibitory regulators of hormone secretion and proliferation . DB00104 and RC-160 ( vapreotide ) are two well tolerated P30874 / P35346 selective somatostatin analogues ( SSA ) that have been used in the treatment of cancers with mixed outcomes . Loss-of-expression of P30874 in tumor tissues has been suggested to correlate to tumor progressions and to the poor outcomes of somatostatin analogue treatment in certain clinical trials . In this study , exogenous human P30874 was overexpressed in two cancer cell lines , capan-2 cells and A549 cells , which had different profiles of endogenous SSTR expression . It was shown that overexpression of P30874 dramatically inhibited the proliferation of P30874 -positive and P30874 -negative cancer cells . Further growth inhibition of these cancer cells overexpressing P30874 was observed by application of octreotide/RC-160 in a dose-dependent fashion . In addition , immunoassay demonstrated that SSA/ P30874 inhibited proliferation via both cell cycle arresting and promoting apoptosis . The results suggested that P30874 could be a promising candidate for gene therapy for P30874 -positive and P30874 -negative tumors . The cellular level of P30874 might be a critical factor that could affect both tumor progression and the outcomes of somatostatin analogue treatment .
