Estrogen upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression in fetal pulmonary artery endothelium . NO , produced by endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) , is a key mediator of pulmonary vasodilation during cardiopulmonary transition at birth . The capacity for NO production is maximal at term because pulmonary P29474 expression increases during late gestation . Since fetal estrogen levels rise markedly during late gestation and there is indirect evidence that the hormone enhances nonpulmonary NO production in adults , estrogen may upregulate P29474 in fetal pulmonary artery endothelium . Therefore , we studied the direct effects of estrogen on P29474 expression in ovine fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( PAECs ) . DB00783 caused a 2.5-fold increase in NOS enzymatic activity in PAEC lysates . This effect was evident after 48 hours , and it occurred in response to physiological concentrations of the hormone ( 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L ) . The increase in NOS activity was related to an upregulation in P29474 protein expression , and P29474 mRNA abundance was also enhanced . P03372 antagonism with DB00947 completely inhibited estrogen-mediated P29474 upregulation , indicating that estrogen receptor activation is necessary for this response . In addition , immunocytochemistry revealed that fetal PAECs express estrogen receptor protein . Furthermore , transient transfection assays with a specific estrogen-responsive reporter system have demonstrated that the endothelial estrogen receptor is capable of estrogen-induced transcriptional transactivation . Thus , estrogen upregulates P29474 gene expression in fetal PAECs through the activation of PAEC estrogen receptors . This mechanism may be responsible for pulmonary P29474 upregulation during late gestation , thereby optimizing the capacity for NO-mediated pulmonary vasodilation at birth .
