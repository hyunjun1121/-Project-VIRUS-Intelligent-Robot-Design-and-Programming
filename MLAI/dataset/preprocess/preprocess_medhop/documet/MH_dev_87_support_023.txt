Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by sulfasalazine is mediated by direct inhibition of IkappaB kinases alpha and beta . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Activation of NF-kappaB/Rel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . Various drugs used in the treatment of Q9UKU7 , such as glucocorticoids , DB00244 , and sulfasalazine , interfere with NF-kappaB/Rel signaling . The aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which sulfasalazine inhibits NF-kappaB activation . METHODS : The effects of sulfasalazine and its moieties on NF-kappaB signaling were evaluated using electromobility shift , transfection , and immune complex kinase assays . The direct effect of sulfasalazine on O15111 ( IKK ) activity was investigated using purified recombinant O15111 and -beta proteins . RESULTS : NF-kappaB/Rel activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , or overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , O15111 , O14920 , or constitutively active O15111 and O14920 mutants was inhibited dose dependently by sulfasalazine . Sulfasalazine inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced activation of endogenous IKK in Jurkat T cells and SW620 colon cells , as well as the catalytic activity of purified O15111 and O14920 in vitro . In contrast , the moieties of sulfasalazine , DB00244 , and sulfapyridine or DB00233 had no effect . Activation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) 1 and 2 , c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) 1 , and p38 was unaffected by sulfasalazine . The decrease in substrate phosphorylation by O15111 and -beta is associated with a decrease in autophosphorylation of IKKs and can be antagonized by excess adenosine triphosphate . CONCLUSIONS : These data identify sulfasalazine as a direct inhibitor of O15111 and -beta by antagonizing adenosine triphosphate binding . The suppression of NF-kappaB activation by inhibition of the IKKs contributes to the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of sulfasalazine .
