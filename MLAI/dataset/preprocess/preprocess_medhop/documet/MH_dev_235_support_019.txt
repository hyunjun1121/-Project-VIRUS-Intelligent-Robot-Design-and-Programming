Q9H4A3 activates large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels through modulation of P27361 /2 signaling . With no lysine ( WNK ) kinases are members of the serine/threonine kinase family . We previously showed that Q96J92 inhibits renal large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) ( BK ) channel activity by enhancing its degradation through a lysosomal pathway . In this study , we investigated the effect of Q9H4A3 on Q12791 activity . In HEK293 cells stably expressing the α subunit of BK ( P29320 -BKα cells ) , siRNA-mediated knockdown of Q9H4A3 expression significantly inhibited both BKα channel activity and open probability . Knockdown of Q9H4A3 expression also significantly inhibited BKα protein expression and increased P27361 /2 phosphorylation , whereas overexpression of Q9H4A3 significantly enhanced BKα expression and decreased P27361 /2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells . Knockdown of P27361 /2 prevented Q9H4A3 siRNA-mediated inhibition of BKα expression . Similarly , pretreatment of P29320 -BKα cells with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 reversed the inhibitory effects of Q9H4A3 siRNA on BKα expression in a dose-dependent manner . Knockdown of Q9H4A3 expression also increased the ubiquitination of BKα channels . Notably , mice fed a high-K(+) diet for 10 days had significantly higher renal protein expression levels of BKα and Q9H4A3 and lower levels of P27361 /2 phosphorylation compared with mice fed a normal-K(+) diet . These data suggest that Q9H4A3 enhances Q12791 function by reducing P27361 /2 signaling-mediated lysosomal degradation of the channel .
