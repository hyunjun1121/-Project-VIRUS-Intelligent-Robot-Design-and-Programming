Shed P04626 extracellular domain in P04626 -mediated tumor growth and in trastuzumab susceptibility . The question of the serum P04626 extracellular domain ( P04626 / O95905 ) measurement for prediction of response to the anti- P04626 antibody DB00072 is still an open and current matter of clinical debate . To elucidate the involvement of shed P04626 / O95905 in P04626 -driven tumor progression and in guiding therapy of individual patients , we examined biological effects exerted by elevated P04626 / O95905 in cancer growth and in response to DB00072 . To this purpose SKOV3 tumor cells were stably transfected to release a recombinant P04626 / O95905 molecule ( rECD ) . Transfectants releasing high levels of 110-kDa rECD , identical in size to native P04626 / O95905 ( nECD ) , grew significantly slower than did controls , which constitutively released only basal levels of nECD . While transmembrane P04626 and P00533 were expressed at equal levels by both controls and transfected cells , activation of these molecules and of downstream P28482 and Akt was significantly reduced only in rECD transfectants . Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed heterodimerization of the rECD with P00533 , -2 , and -3 . In cell growth bioassays in vitro , shed P04626 significantly blocked P04626 -driven tumor cell proliferation . In mice , high levels of circulating rECD significantly impaired P04626 -driven SKOV3 tumor growth but not that of P04626 -negative tumor cells . In vitro and in mice , DB00072 significantly inhibited tumor growth due to the rECD-facilitated accumulation of the antibody on tumor cells . Globally our findings sustain the biological relevance of elevated P04626 / O95905 levels in the outcome of P04626 -disease and in the susceptibility to DB00072 -based therapy .
