P10275 in nuclei of rat testis . Testis nuclei of hypophysectomized rats selectively accumulate labeled testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone following the injection of tritiated testosterone in vivo . DB00624 and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone are bound to macromolecules in nuclei and can be extracted with 0.5 M DB00761 . Accumulation of protein bound radioactive androgens in nuclei of isolated seminiferous tubules is similar to that of whole testis . The relative amounts of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in purified nuclei were similar to the relative amounts bound to cytoplasmic receptors , suggesting that cytoplasmic androgen-receptor complexes may be transported into the nuclei . Binding of labeled androgen is saturable and inhibited by prior injection of unlabeled testosterone or cyproterone acetate . Nuclear binding sites are destroyed by the proteolytic enzyme pronase , but not by DNase . Like the cytoplasmic androgen-receptor complexes in rat testis , nuclear androgen-protein complexes are heat labile and dissociate slowly at 0 degrees C. androgens fail to accumulate in testis nuclei of the Stanley-Gumbreck androgen insensitive rat , a species lacking cytoplasmic androgen receptors in testis and other androgen target tissues .
