Chemically synthesized SDF-1alpha analogue , N33A , is a potent chemotactic agent for P61073 / P61073 / P61073 -expressing human leukocytes . Stromal cell-derived factor ( SDF ) 1 is a potent chemoattractant for leukocytes through activation of the receptor P61073 / P61073 / P61073 , which is a fusion co-factor for the entry of T lymphocytotropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) . This P61073 -mediated HIV-1 fusion can be inhibited by P48061 . Because of its importance in the study of immunity and AIDS , large scale production of P48061 is desirable . In addition to recombinant technology , chemical synthesis provides means by which biologically active proteins can be produced not only in large quantity but also with a variety of designed modifications . In this study , we investigated the binding and function of an SDF-1alpha analogue , N33A , synthesized by a newly developed native chemical ligation approach . Radioiodinated N33A showed high affinity binding to human monocytes , T lymphocytes , as well as neutrophils , and competed equally well with native recombinant SDF-1alpha for binding sites on leukocytes . N33A also showed equally potent chemoattractant activity as native recombinant SDF-1alpha for human leukocytes . Further study with P61073 / P61073 / P61073 transfected P29320 293 cells showed that N33A binds and induces directional migration of these cells in vitro . These results demonstrate that the chemically synthesized SDF-1alpha analogue , N33A , which can be produced rapidly in large quantity , possesses the same capacity as native SDF-1alpha to activate P61073 -expressing cells and will provide a valuable agent for research on the host immune response and AIDS .
