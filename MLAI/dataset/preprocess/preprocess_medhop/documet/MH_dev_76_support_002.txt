Epithelial calcium-sensing receptor activation by eosinophil granule protein analog stimulates collagen matrix contraction . BACKGROUND : Eosinophils reside in normal gastrointestinal tracts and increase during disease states . Receptors for eosinophil-derived granule proteins ( EDGPs ) have not been identified , but highly cationic molecules , similar to eosinophil proteins , bind extracellular calcium-sensing receptors ( CaSRs ) . We hypothesized that stimulation of CaSRs by eosinophil proteins activates epithelial cells . METHODS : Caco2 intestinal epithelial cells , AML14.3D10 eosinophils , wild-type ( WT ) human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells not expressing CaSRs ( P29320 -WT ) , and P41180 -transfected HEK293 cells ( P29320 - P41180 ) were stimulated with an eosinophil protein analog poly-L-arginine ( PA ) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)1 and pERK2 were measured . Functional activation was measured with collagen lattice contraction assays . RESULTS : Coculture of Caco2 cells with AML14.3D10 eosinophils augmented lattice contraction as compared with lattices containing Caco2 cells alone . PA stimulation of Caco2 lattices augmented contraction . P29320 - P41180 stimulation with PA or Ca(2+) resulted in greater pERK activation than that of stimulated P29320 -WT cells . PA stimulated greater P29320 - P41180 lattice contraction than unstimulated lattices . Contraction of PA-stimulated and PA-unstimulated P29320 -WT lattices did not differ . CONCLUSION : Exposure of intestinal epithelia to the EDGP analog PA stimulates P41180 -dependent P29323 phosphorylation and epithelial-mediated collagen lattice contraction . We speculate that EDGP release within the epithelial layers activates the P41180 receptor , leading to matrix contraction and tissue fibrosis .
