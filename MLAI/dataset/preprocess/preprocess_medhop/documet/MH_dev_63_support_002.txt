Intracellular volume and apparent diffusion constants of perfused cancer cell cultures , as measured by NMR . Diffusion NMR spectroscopy was used to study intracellular volume and apparent water diffusion constants in different cell lines ( DU145 , human prostate cancer ; P01008 , rat prostate cancer ; MCF-7 , human breast cancer ; Q9HBH0 -1 , mouse fibrosacroma ) . The cells were grown on various matrices ( collagen sponge , collagen beads , polystyrene beads ) which enabled continuous growth in perfused high density cell culture suitable for NMR studies . In perfused cell systems , the attenuation of the water signal versus the squared gradient strength was fitted by the sum of two decaying exponentials . For the slowly decaying component the apparent water diffusion constant at 37 degrees C was 0.22 ( +/-0.02 ) x 10(-9) s/m2 for all cell lines at diffusion times > 100 ms . It continuously increased up to 0.47 ( +/-0.05 ) x 10(-9) s/m2 when the diffusion time was decreased to 8 ms , indicating restricted diffusion . No significant effect of the matrices was observed . The fractional volume of the slow component as determined from the biexponential diffusion curve correlated with the relative intracellular volume , as obtained from the cell density in the sample and the cell size as measured by light microscopy . Therefore , this simple NMR approach can be used to determine intracellular volume in perfused cell cultures suitable for NMR studies . Using this information in combination with spectroscopic data , changes in intracellular metabolite concentration can be detected even when the cellular volume is changing during the experiment . The apparent diffusion constant for the fast diffusing component varied with growth matrix , cell density and cell type and also showed the typical characteristics of restricted diffusion ( increase of apparent diffusion constant with time ) .
