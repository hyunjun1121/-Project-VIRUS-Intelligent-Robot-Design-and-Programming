[ Diagnosis and treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia ] . OBJECTIVE : To explore the clinical feature , therapeutic effect and prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia . METHODS : The clinical characteristics , laboratory findings , treatment and outcome of 40 patients were retrospectively analyzed . The main treatment was a low-protein diet supplemented with L-carnitine and special milk free of leucine , valine , threonine and methionine . DB00115 was also given to cobalamin responders . The patients were followed up every 1-3 months . RESULTS : Mutations in the P22033 gene were identified in 30 of 33 patients who had accepted DNA testing . Thirty cases were treated and followed up regularly for from 1 month to 8 years . Eight cases had died , 8 had developed normal intelligence , among whom 4 from newborn screening were asymptomatic . Psychomotor developmental delay and mental retardation were present in 14 cases . The propionylcarnitine level , ratio of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine in blood , methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid levels in urine have decreased significantly , with the median values reduced respectively from 24.15 ( 7.92-81.02 ) μmol/L , 1.08 ( 0.38-6.01 ) , 705.34 ( 113.79-3078.60 ) and 7.71 ( 0.52-128.21 ) to 10.50 ( 3.00-30.92 ) μmol/L , 0.63 ( 0.25-2.89 ) , 166.23 ( 22.40-3322.21 ) and 3.96 ( 0.94-119.13 ) ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : The prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia may be predicted with the enzymatic subgroup , age at onset and cobalamin responsiveness . Outcome is unfavorable in neonatal patients and those who were non-responsive to cobalamin .
