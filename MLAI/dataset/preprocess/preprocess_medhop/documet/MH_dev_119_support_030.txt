15-Deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 inhibits the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in endothelial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide . P04141 ( GM- P04141 ) , one of major hematopoietic growth factors , activates mature leukocytes . GM- P04141 is produced by endothelial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , and the LPS-induced GM- P04141 production may play an important role in the activation of neutrophils on the endothelial surface . 15-Deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 ( 15d-PGJ2 ) is a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) and modulates inflammatory reactions by regulating the expression of various genes . We studied the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the LPS-induced GM- P04141 expression in endothelial cells . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were cultured and the expressions of GM- P04141 mRNA and protein were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively . 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the LPS-induced GM- P04141 expression in a concentration-dependent manner ; but ciglitazone , another agonist for P37231 , had no effect . This suggests that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits GM- P04141 expression through a mechanism unrelated to P37231 . 15d-PGJ2 induced , by itself , the expression of interleukin-8 , a potent proinflammatory chemokine , in HUVEC . 15d-PGJ2 may regulate inflammatory reactions by controlling the balance of various cytokines .
