Q07869 agonists for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes . Diabetes is a complex disease defined by hyperglycaemia ; however , strong associations with abdominal obesity , hypertension and dyslipidaemia contribute to the high risk of cardiovascular disease . Although aggressive glycaemic control reduces microvascular complications , the evidence for macrovascular complications is less certain . The theoretical benefits of the mode of action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) agonists are clear . In clinical practice , Q07869 -α agonists such as fibrates improve dyslipidaemia , while Q07869 -γ agonists such as thiazolidinediones improve insulin resistance and diabetes control . However , although these agents are traditionally classed according to their target , they have different and sometimes conflicting clinical benefit and adverse event profiles . It is speculated that this is because of differing properties and specificities for the Q07869 receptors ( each of which targets specific genes ) . This is most obvious in the impact on cardiovascular outcomes -- in clinical trials pioglitazone appeared to reduce cardiovascular events , whereas rosiglitazone potentially increased the risk of myocardial infarction . The development of a dual Q07869 -α/γ agonist may prove beneficial in effectively managing glycaemic control and improving dyslipidaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes . Yet , development of agents such as muraglitazar and tesaglitazar has been hindered by various serious adverse events . DB08915 , a balanced dual Q07869 -α/γ agonist , is currently the most advanced in clinical development and has shown promising results in phase II clinical trials with beneficial effects on glucose and lipid variables . A phase III study , ALECARDIO , is ongoing and will establish whether improvements in laboratory test profiles translate into an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes .
