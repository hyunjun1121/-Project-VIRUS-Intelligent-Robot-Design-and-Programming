Delineation of gastric cancer subtypes by co-regulated expression of receptor tyrosine kinases and chemosensitivity genes . Chemotherapy plays a key role in improving disease-free survival and overall survival of gastric cancer ( GC ) ; however , response rates are variable and a non-negligible proportion of patients undergo toxic and costly chemotherapeutic regimens without a survival benefit . Several studies have shown the existence of GC subtypes which may predict survival and respond differently to chemotherapy . It is also known that the expression level of chemotherapy-related and target therapy-related genes correlates with response to specific antitumor drugs . Nevertheless , these genes have not been considered jointly to define GC subtypes . In this study , we evaluated seven genes known to influence chemotherapeutic response ( P07992 , P38398 , P23921 , Q13509 , P16949 , P04818 and P11388 ) and five receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) ( P00533 , P04626 , P09619 , P17948 and P35968 ) . We demonstrate significant heterogeneity of gene expression among GC patients and identified four GC subtypes using the expression profiles of eight genes in two co-regulation groups : chemosensitivity ( P38398 , P16949 , P04818 and P11388 ) and RTKs ( P00533 , P09619 , P17948 and P35968 ) . The results are of immediate translational value regarding GC diagnostics and therapeutics , as many of these genes are curently widely used in relevant clinical testing .
