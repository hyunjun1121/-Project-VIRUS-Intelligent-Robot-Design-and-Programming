Thrombin regulates the function of human blood dendritic cells . Thrombin is the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade and activates endothelial cells , neutrophils and monocytes via protease-activated receptors ( PARs ) . At the inflammatory site , immune cells have an opportunity to encounter thrombin . However little is known about the effect of thrombin for dendritic cells ( DC ) , which are efficient antigen-presenting cells and play important roles in initiating and regulating immune responses . The present study revealed that thrombin has the ability to stimulate blood DC . Plasmacytoid DC ( P20941 ) and myeloid DC ( MDC ) isolated from PBMC expressed P25116 and released P13500 , P22301 , and IL-12 after thrombin stimulation . Unlike blood DC , monocyte-derived DC ( MoDC ) , differentiated in vitro did not express P25116 and were unresponsive to thrombin . Effects of thrombin on blood DC were significantly diminished by the addition of anti- P25116 Ab or hirudin , serine protease inhibitor . Moreover , thrombin induced HLA-DR and P42081 expression on DC and the thrombin-treated DC induced allogenic T cell proliferation . These findings indicate that thrombin plays a role in the regulation of blood DC functions .
