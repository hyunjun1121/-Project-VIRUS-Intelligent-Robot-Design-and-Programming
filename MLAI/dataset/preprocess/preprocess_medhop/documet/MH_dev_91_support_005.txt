Genetic variants associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with and without lung cancer . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) is a strong risk factor for lung cancer . Published studies about variations of genes encoding glutathione metabolism , DNA repair , and inflammatory response pathways in susceptibility to P48444 were inconclusive . We evaluated 470 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) from 56 genes of these three pathways in 620 cases and 893 controls to identify susceptibility markers for P48444 risk , using existing resources . We assessed SNP- and gene-level effects adjusting for sex , age , and smoking status . Differential genetic effects on disease risk with and without lung cancer were also assessed ; cumulative risk models were established . Twenty-one SNPs were found to be significantly associated with risk of P48444 ( P < 0.01 ) ; gene-based analyses confirmed two genes ( P48506 and P48637 ) and identified three additional genes ( Q9H4Y5 , P07992 , and P23921 ) . Carrying 12 high-risk alleles may increase risk by 2.7-fold ; eight SNPs altered P48444 risk without lung cancer by 3.1-fold and 4 SNPs altered the risk with lung cancer by 2.3-fold . Our findings indicate that multiple genetic variations in the three selected pathways contribute to P48444 risk through P48506 , P48637 , Q9H4Y5 , P07992 , and P23921 genes . Functional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of these genes in the development of P48444 , lung cancer , or both .
