Analgesics . DB00945 and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are often incriminated in hypersensitivity reactions leading to anaphylaxis . Two populations are at the high risk of developing such reactions : patients with asthma and those with urticaria . In a subset of asthmatics , NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) precipitate non-allergic , hypersensitivity reactions , characterized by violent attacks of dyspnea . These patients suffer from a distinct clinical syndrome , called aspirin induced asthma ( AIA ) , which includes chronic eosinophilic rhinusinusitis and persistent asthma . Inpatients with chronic idiopathic urticaria , and less commonly in patients without chronic urticaria , NSAIDs usually acting through inhibition of P23219 can induce or exacerbate skin eruptions . While alterations in eicosanoid biosynthesis characterized both AIA and aspirin-triggered urticaria , other patients may rarely manifest IgE-mediated reactions .
