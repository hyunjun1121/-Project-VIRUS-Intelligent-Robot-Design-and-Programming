Modulating micro-opioid receptor phosphorylation switches agonist-dependent signaling as reflected in PKCepsilon activation and dendritic spine stability . A new role of G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) phosphorylation was demonstrated in the current studies by using the μ-opioid receptor ( P35372 ) as a model . Morphine induces a low level of receptor phosphorylation and uses the PKCε pathway to induce P29323 phosphorylation and receptor desensitization , whereas etorphine , fentanyl , and [ D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol ] -enkephalin ( DAMGO ) induce extensive receptor phosphorylation and use the β-arrestin2 pathway . Blocking P35372 phosphorylation ( by mutating Ser363 , Thr370 and Ser375 to Ala ) enabled etorphine , fentanyl , and DAMGO to use the PKCε pathway . This was not due to the decreased recruitment of β-arrestin2 to the receptor signaling complex , because these agonists were unable to use the PKCε pathway when β-arrestin2 was absent . In addition , overexpressing G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ( P25098 ) decreased the ability of morphine to activate PKCε , whereas overexpressing dominant-negative P25098 enabled etorphine , fentanyl , and DAMGO to activate PKCε . Furthermore , by overexpressing wild-type P35372 and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons , we demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation contributes to the differential effects of agonists on dendritic spine stability . Phosphorylation blockage made etorphine , fentanyl , and DAMGO function as morphine in the primary cultures . Therefore , agonist-dependent phosphorylation of GPCR regulates the activation of the PKC pathway and the subsequent responses .
