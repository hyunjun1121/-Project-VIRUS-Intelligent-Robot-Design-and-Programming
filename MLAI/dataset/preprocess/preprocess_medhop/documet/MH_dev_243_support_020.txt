Oral leucine supplementation is sensed by the brain but neither reduces food intake nor induces an anorectic pattern of gene expression in the hypothalamus . DB00149 activates the intracellular mammalian target of the rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway , and hypothalamic P42345 signaling regulates food intake . Although central infusion of leucine reduces food intake , it is still uncertain whether oral leucine supplementation is able to affect the hypothalamic circuits that control energy balance . We observed increased phosphorylation of p70s6k in the mouse hypothalamus after an acute oral gavage of leucine . We then assessed whether acute oral gavage of leucine induces the activation of neurons in several hypothalamic nuclei and in the brainstem . DB00149 did not induce the expression of Fos in hypothalamic nuclei , but it increased the number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the area postrema . In addition , oral gavage of leucine acutely increased the 24 h food intake of mice . Nonetheless , chronic leucine supplementation in the drinking water did not change the food intake and the weight gain of ob/ob mice and of wild-type mice consuming a low- or a high-fat diet . We assessed the hypothalamic gene expression and observed that leucine supplementation increased the expression of enzymes ( P54687 , O15382 and O14874 ) that metabolize branched-chain amino acids . Despite these effects , leucine supplementation did not induce an anorectic pattern of gene expression in the hypothalamus . In conclusion , our data show that the brain is able to sense oral leucine intake . However , the food intake is not modified by chronic oral leucine supplementation . These results question the possible efficacy of leucine supplementation as an appetite suppressant to treat obesity .
