Negative pressure accelerated monolayer keratinocyte healing involves Cdc42 mediated cell podia formation . BACKGROUND : Negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) is developed to facilitate wound healing at controlled subatmospheric pressures in modern medicine . Molecular mechanism for this therapy is still undefined . OBJECTIVE : This study highlights the localization and time-course of the cell division control protein 42 ( Cdc42 ) in the cell membrane at ambient pressure ( AP ) and negative pressures of 75mmHg ( NP75 ) , 125mmHg ( NP125 ) and 175mmHg ( NP175 ) . METHODS : The prepared cells were cultured in a negative pressure incubator with the same O2 and CO2 tensions at the four different pressures . The effective time , complete wound closure time , cell volume , cell viability , and the fluorescence of proliferating cell nuclear antigens ( P12004 ) and actins were evaluated in cells at different pressures . Wound-healing process and Cdc42 fluorescence were examined in cells with the knockdown of Cdc42 . Cdc42 pathway proteins in cell membranes were analyzed after incubation at different pressures for 6 and 12h . RESULTS : The cells at NP125 had less wound closure time and obvious cell podia . Similar P12004 fluorescent intensity was observed in cells at different pressures . The Cdc42 , neural P42768 , and actin expression increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) in plasma membranes of cells at NP125 for 12h . The knockdown of active Cdc42 resulted in the absence of Cdc42 expression at the cell leading edge . CONCLUSIONS : The activation and localization of Cdc42 pathway proteins in the cell membrane are involved in the cell podia formation in keratinocytes at NP125 . NPWT may facilitate cell migration to accelerate wound healing .
