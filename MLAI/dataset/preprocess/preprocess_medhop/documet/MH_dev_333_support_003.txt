DB00125 metabolic enzymes , nitric oxide and infection . DB00435 ( NO ) is synthesized from arginine by NO synthase ( NOS ) , and the availability of arginine is one of the rate-limiting factors in cellular NO production . DB00155 that is formed as a by-product of the NOS reaction can be recycled to arginine by successive actions of argininosuccinate synthetase ( AS ) and argininosuccinate lyase ( AL ) , forming the citrulline-NO cycle . AS and sometimes AL have been shown to be coinduced with inducible NOS ( P35228 ) in various cell types including activated macrophages , microglia , vascular smooth muscle cells , glial cells , neuronal PC12 cells , retinal pigment epithelial cells , and pancreatic beta-cells . Coinduction of endothelial NOS ( P29474 ) , AS , and AL are observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . In contrast , arginase can downregulate NO production by decreasing intracellular arginine concentrations . P35228 and arginase activities are regulated reciprocally in macrophages by cytokines , and this may guarantee the efficient production of NO . In contrast , P35228 and arginase isoforms ( type I and/or II ) are coinduced in immunostimulated macrophages , but not in PC12 cells and glial cells . These results indicate that NO production is modulated by the recycling and degradation of arginine . Arginase also plays an important role in regulation of polyamine and proline synthesis .
