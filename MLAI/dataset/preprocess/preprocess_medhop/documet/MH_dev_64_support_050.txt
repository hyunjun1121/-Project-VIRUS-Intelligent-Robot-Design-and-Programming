DB08916 in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . INTRODUCTION : Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in the United States . Treatment of locally advanced disease is associated with significant acute side effects and can lead to chronic disabilities , while the prognosis of recurrent or metastatic disease is very poor . This highlights the need for better therapeutic options . P00533 is overexpressed in 90 % of HNSCC patients and is an attractive therapeutic target in this patient population . DB08916 is a potent , irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor . Preliminary studies in HNSCC show promising activity . AREAS COVERED : This article reviews the current data evaluating small molecules inhibitors of the ErbB family in the treatment of HNSCC with a specific emphasis on afatinib , a second-generation , irreversible , pan-ErbB inhibitor . It also provides a description of afatinib 's drug characteristics , pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile as well as details of the published and ongoing clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in HNSCC patients . EXPERT OPINION : Phase II trials in HNSCC show that daily oral treatment with afatinib is tolerable . Most common toxicities are skin rash and diarrhea . DB08916 has clinical activity as a single agent in a subset of refractory and/or metastatic HNSCC patients . It is thought that ongoing Phase III trials should better clarify the role of this compound in the treatment of HNSCC .
