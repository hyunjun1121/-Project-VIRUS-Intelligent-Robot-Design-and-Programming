DB03203 kinase-1 activation causes acquired resistance against DB01268 in renal cell carcinoma cells . Multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor DB01268 has been widely used in cancer treatment , including metastatic renal cell carcinoma . However , most patients who initially benefit from DB01268 develop resistance with extended usage of DB01268 , which is referred to as " acquired resistance " . The molecular mechanisms contributing to this acquired resistance remain poorly understood . In this present study , we established DB01268 -resistant cell lines from human renal cell lines ( 786-O , A498 , ACHN and CAKI1 ) by continuous treatment with DB01268 to explore the molecular mechanism leading to DB01268 resistance . We found that P09619 -Î² expression in cell seems to be a protective factor against DB01268 resistance formation . In addition , we found that both SK1 and P29323 were activated in DB01268 -resistance cell lines and SK1 and P29323 inhibitors could resensitize DB01268 -resistant cell lines . In conclusion , our observations suggest that SK1 and P29323 activation is a feature of resistant cell lines , which serves as an alternative pathway evading anti-tumor activity of DB01268 .
