P35372 and P00533 contribute to skin pigmentation differences between Indigenous Americans and Europeans . Contemporary variation in skin pigmentation is the result of hundreds of thousands years of human evolution in new and changing environments . Previous studies have identified several genes involved in skin pigmentation differences among African , Asian , and European populations . However , none have examined skin pigmentation variation among Indigenous American populations , creating a critical gap in our understanding of skin pigmentation variation . This study investigates signatures of selection at 76 pigmentation candidate genes that may contribute to skin pigmentation differences between Indigenous Americans and Europeans . Analysis was performed on two samples of Indigenous Americans genotyped on genome-wide SNP arrays . Using four tests for natural selection -- locus-specific branch length ( LSBL ) , ratio of heterozygosities ( lnRH ) , Tajima 's D difference , and extended haplotype homozygosity ( EHH ) -- we identified 14 selection-nominated candidate genes ( SNCGs ) . SNPs in each of the SNCGs were tested for association with skin pigmentation in 515 admixed Indigenous American and European individuals from regions of the Americas with high ground-level ultraviolet radiation . In addition to Q71RS6 and Q9UMX9 , genes previously associated with European/non-European differences in skin pigmentation , P35372 and P00533 were associated with variation in skin pigmentation in New World populations for the first time .
