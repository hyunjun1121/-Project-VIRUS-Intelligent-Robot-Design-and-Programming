Signaling by retinol and its serum binding protein . DB00162 , retinol , circulates in blood bound to retinol-binding protein ( P02753 ) which , in turn , associates with transthyretin ( P02766 ) to form a retinol- P02753 - P02766 ternary complex . At some tissues , retinol-bound ( holo- ) P02753 is recognized by a membrane protein termed Q9BX79 , which transports retinol from extracellular P02753 into cells and , concomitantly , activates a O60674 / P40763 /5 signaling cascade that culminates in induction of P35610 target genes . Q9BX79 -mediated retinol transport and cell signaling are critically inter-dependent , and they both require the presence of cellular retinol-binding protein 1 ( P09455 ) , an intracellular retinol acceptor , as well as a retinol-metabolizing enzyme such as lecithin:retinol acyltransferase ( O95237 ) . Q9BX79 thus functions as a " cytokine signaling transporter " which couples vitamin A homeostasis and metabolism to cell signaling , thereby regulating gene transcription . Recent studies provided molecular level insights into the mode of action of this unique protein .
