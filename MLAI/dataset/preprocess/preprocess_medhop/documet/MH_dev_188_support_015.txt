Inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 ( P40763 ) signaling pathway by 4-oxo-1-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid esters . The JAK- P40763 pathway regulates genes that are important in cell proliferation and thus is a promising target for cancer therapy . A high-throughput screening ( HTS ) campaign using an Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase 3/7 assay in U266 cells identified 4-oxo-1-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester 4 as a potential P40763 pathway inhibitor . Optimization of this HTS hit led to the identification of the 7-cyano analogue 8 , which inhibited P40763 -Y705 phosphorylation with an EC 50 of 170 nM . Compound 8 also inhibited cytokine induced JAK activation but did not inhibit P11274 - P00519 activated P42229 phosphorylation in K562 cells .
