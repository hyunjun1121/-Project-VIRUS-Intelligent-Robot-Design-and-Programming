Partial agonists of the α3β4* neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor reduce ethanol consumption and seeking in rats . DB00898 use disorders ( AUDs ) impact millions of individuals and there remain few effective treatment strategies . Despite evidence that neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) have a role in AUDs , it has not been established which subtypes of the nAChR are involved . Recent human genetic association studies have implicated the gene cluster P32297 - P30532 - P30926 encoding the α3 , α5 , and β4 subunits of the nAChR in susceptibility to develop nicotine and alcohol dependence ; however , their role in ethanol-mediated behaviors is unknown due to the lack of suitable and selective research tools . To determine the role of the α3 , and β4 subunits of the nAChR in ethanol self-administration , we developed and characterized high-affinity partial agonists at α3β4 nAChRs , CP-601932 , and PF-4575180 . Both CP-601932 and PF-4575180 selectively decrease ethanol but not sucrose consumption and operant self-administration following long-term exposure . We show that the functional potencies of CP-601932 and PF-4575180 at α3β4 nAChRs correlate with their unbound rat brain concentrations , suggesting that the effects on ethanol self-administration are mediated via interaction with α3β4 nAChRs . Also varenicline , an approved smoking cessation aid previously shown to decrease ethanol consumption and seeking in rats and mice , reduces ethanol intake at unbound brain concentrations that allow functional interactions with α3β4 nAChRs . Furthermore , the selective α4β2(*) nAChR antagonist , DHβE , did not reduce ethanol intake . Together , these data provide further support for the human genetic association studies , implicating P32297 and P30926 genes in ethanol-mediated behaviors . CP-601932 has been shown to be safe in humans and may represent a potential novel treatment for AUDs .
