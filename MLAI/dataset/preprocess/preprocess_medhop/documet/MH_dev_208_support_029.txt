P06401 -induced gene expression in primary mouse granulosa cell cultures . The progesterone receptor ( P06401 ) is induced by luteinizing hormone ( LH ) in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles , and the P06401 -A isoform is essential for ovulation based on the phenotypes of Pgr isoform-specific knockout mice . Although several genes regulated by P06401 -A in vivo have been identified , whether these genes are primary targets of P06401 -A or if their expression also depends on other signaling molecules that are induced by the LH surge has not been resolved . Therefore , to identify genes that are either induced or repressed by P06401 in the absence of LH-mediated signaling cascades , we infected primary cultures of mouse granulosa cells with either P06401 -A or P06401 -B adenoviral vectors without or with R-5020 as a P06401 ligand . Total RNA was extracted from infected cells at 16 h and analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 microarrays . P06401 -A in the presence or absence of ligand significantly induced approximately 50 genes 2-fold or more ( local pooled error test at P < or= 0.01 ) . Fewer and different genes were induced by P06401 -B in the absence of ligand . Edn1 , Apoa1 , and Cited1 were primarily regulated by P06401 -A as verified by additional RT-PCR analyses , suppression by the P06401 antagonist DB00834 , and the lack of induction by protein kinase A , protein kinase C , or epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) -like factors pathways . P06401 regulation of these genes was confirmed further by gene expression analyses in hormonally primed Pgr mutant mouse ovaries . Because Edn1 , Apoa1 , and Cited1 are known to regulate angiogenesis , P06401 may affect the neovascularization of follicles that is initiated with ovulation .
