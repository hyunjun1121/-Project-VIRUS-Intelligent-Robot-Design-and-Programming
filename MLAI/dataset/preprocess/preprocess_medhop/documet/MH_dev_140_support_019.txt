Gastrointestinal stromal tumor . Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract . These form a distinct category of tumors characterized by oncogenic mutations of the P10721 receptor tyrosine kinase in a majority of patients . P10721 is used not only for diagnosis but also for targeted therapy of GISTs . Imatinib , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , is widely used in the treatment of advanced and metastatic GISTs and has been recently employed in the neo adjuvant and adjuvant set-up with encouraging results . Certain specific mutations in an exon ( such as in exon 9 ) of the P10721 gene result in GISTs that are relatively unresponsive to the Imatinib treatment . New therapeutic agents like DB01268 have now been approved for the treatment of Imatinib-resistant GIST . This review summarizes the salient features of GIST along with a detailed review of targeted multi-disciplinary approach to the treatment of these special tumors .
