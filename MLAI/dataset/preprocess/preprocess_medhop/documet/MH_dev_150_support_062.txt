P10275 negatively influences the expression of chemokine receptors ( P61073 , P32246 ) and ligand-mediated migration in prostate cancer DU-145 . We previously reported that androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a role in the regulation of adhesion to the extracellular matrix and invasion of human prostate cancer cells by influencing the expression of specific integrin subunits . It is now considered that chemokines play a significant role in organ-selective cancer metastasis . In this study , we hypothesized that AR may influence the expression of these chemokine receptors and cell function . The mRNA expression of chemokine receptors in human prostate cancer cell line DU-145 and DU-145 cells expressing AR ( DU-145/AR ) was investigated by RT-PCR . DU-145 cells selectively expressed P61073 and P32246 mRNA at high levels compared with DU-145/AR cells . DU-145 showed vigorous migratory responses to its ligand P48061 ( also called stromal-derived factor-1alpha , SDF-1alpha ) and P10147 ( also called macrophage inflammatory protein-1 , MIP-1alpha ) . In contrast , neither P48061 nor P10147 affected the migration of DU-145/AR cells . These results indicate that expression of AR down-regulates the migratory responses of human prostate cancer cells via chemokine and its receptor systems .
