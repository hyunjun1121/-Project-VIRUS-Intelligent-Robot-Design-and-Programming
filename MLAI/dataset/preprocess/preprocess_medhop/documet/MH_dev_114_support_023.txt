Reactive oxygen species-dependent P01375 converting enzyme activation through stimulation of P41595 and alpha1D autoreceptors in neuronal cells . A major determinant of neuronal homeostasis is the proper integration of cell signaling pathways recruited by a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal factors . By taking advantage of a neuroectodermal cell line ( 1C11 ) endowed with the capacity to differentiate into serotonergic ( 1C115-HT ) or noradrenergic ( 1C11NE ) neurons , we identified serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) - and norepinephrine ( NE ) -dependent signaling cascades possibly involved in neuronal functions . First , we establish that P41595 receptors and 1D adrenoceptors are functionally coupled to reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) synthesis through NADPH oxidase activation in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells . This observation constitutes the prime evidence that bioaminergic autoreceptors take part in the control of the cellular redox equilibrium in a neuronal context . Second , our data identify P78536 ( P01375 - Converting Enzyme ) , a member of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) family , as a downstream target of the P41595 and 1D receptor-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways . Upon P41595 or 1D receptor stimulation , ROS fully govern P01375 - shedding in the surrounding milieu of 1C115-HT or 1C11NE cells . Third , P41595 and 1Dreceptor couplings to the NADPH oxidase- P78536 cascade are strictly restricted to 1C11-derived progenies that have implemented a complete serotonergic or noradrenergic phenotype . Overall , these observations suggest that P41595 and 1D autoreceptors may play a role in the maintenance of neuron- and neurotransmitter-associated functions . Eventually , our study may have implications regarding the origin of oxidative stress as well as up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in neurodegenerative disorders , which may relate to the deviation of normal signaling pathways .
