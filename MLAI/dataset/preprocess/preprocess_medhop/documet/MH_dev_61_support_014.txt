[ Relationship between basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and cell proliferation , invasion in pituitary adenoma ] . P09038 ( P09038 ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) were examined by immunohistochemistry in fifty-one pituitary adenomas . The results showed that the intensity of P09038 expression was strong or intermediate in twenty-nine adenomas , which was positively related to cell proliferation , there was positive relationship between P09038 expressin and tumor invasion in non-functional adenomas . The data suggest that P09038 may play some role in the origin and progression of pituitary adenomas .
