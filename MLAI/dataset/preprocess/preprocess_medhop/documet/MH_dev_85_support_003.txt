In vivo selection for human and murine hematopoietic cells transduced with a therapeutic P16455 lentiviral vector that inhibits HIV replication . We have developed an HIV-based lentiviral vector , DB05251 , which efficiently transduces human P28906 + progenitors and P01730 + T lymphocytes . DB05251 contains an antisense sequence against the HIV envelope and is currently being evaluated for safety in a clinical trial for treatment of HIV . Selective outgrowth of transduced hematopoietic cells in vivo is anticipated to increase the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment by maximizing the persistence of virus-resistant cells in the body . Although HIV resistance is selective , additional selection may aid in treatment efficacy due to the vast quantity of target cells . Therefore , we engineered DB05251 to express the P140K P16455 gene to drive potent drug-mediated in vivo selection for transduced hematopoietic long-term repopulating cells . Suboptimally transduced T cell cultures treated with O6-benzylguanine and DB00262 were selected from 3 to 100 % , and after selection cultures did not support HIV replication . Primary P28906 + progenitors derived from G- P04141 -mobilized peripheral blood were transduced at 27 to 35 % efficiency . Approximate sixfold selection was observed for transduced P28906 + progenitors , colony-forming units , and long-term culture-initiating cells . Multilineage in vivo selection was demonstrated for transduced murine hematopoietic cells in human P28906 (+)-derived hematopoietic cells in NOD-SCID mice . These results establish efficient ex vivo and in vivo selection for hematopoietic cells transduced with lentiviral vectors and support the potential therapeutic benefit of this strategy in human gene therapy .
