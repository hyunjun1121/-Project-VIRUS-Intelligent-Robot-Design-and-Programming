Immunotoxicity of aminocarb . III . Exposure route-dependent immunomodulation by aminocarb in mice . Aminocarb , a phenylsubstituted methylcarbamate pesticide ( 4-dimethylamino-3-methyl-N-carbamate ; matacil ) , previously suspected of a relatively low immunotoxic potential , was administered by four different exposure routes to C57BL/6 mice . A single sublethal exposure by oral and dermal routes stimulated humoral immune response at a relatively low dose ; 1/256 LD50 of aminocarb . Intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection decreased the humoral P27918 response , whereas inhalation of aminocarb had no marked effect on peripheral immune status in exposed animals . Thus , i.p. exposure resulted in higher immunotoxicity over oral administration of aminocarb . Similarly , marked route-related exposure differences in immunomodulatory effects of aminocarb were noted for mitogenic stimulation of spleen lymphocytes and mixed lymphocyte response . Other indices , such as delayed type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) and production of interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) were unchanged . Interestingly , expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II by purified , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated B cells increased equally after i.p. and oral exposures to aminocarb . Overall , a weak immunosuppressive potential of aminocarb was concluded , which was possibly due to indirect interaction of the pesticide with the immune system . However , aminocarb may represent an autoimmunity-inducing toxic .
