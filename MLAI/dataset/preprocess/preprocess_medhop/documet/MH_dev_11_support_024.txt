Effects of retinol binding protein-4 on vascular endothelial cells . The study was designed to investigate the effect of retinol binding protein ( P02753 ) -4 on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways , which mediate the effects of insulin in vascular endothelial cells . The effects of P02753 on nitric oxide ( NO ) and insulin-stimulated endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) secretion and on phosphorylation ( p ) of Akt , endothelial NO synthetase ( P29474 ) , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 were investigated in bovine vascular aortic endothelial cells ( BAECs ) . P02753 showed an acute vasodilatatory effect on aortic rings of rats within a few minutes . In BAECs , P02753 -treatment for 5min significantly increased NO production , but inhibited insulin-stimulated ET-1 secretion . P02753 -induced NO production was not inhibited by tetraacetoxymethylester ( BAPTA-AM ) , an intracellular calcium chelator , but was completely abolished by wortmannin , a PI3K inhibitor . P02753 significantly increased p-Akt and p- P29474 production , and significantly inhibited p- P27361 /2 production . Triciribine , an Akt inhibitor , and wortmannin significantly inhibited P02753 -induced p-Akt and p- P29474 production . Inhibition of Akt1 by small interfering RNA decreased p- P29474 production enhanced by P02753 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . In conclusion , P02753 has a robust acute effect of enhancement of NO production via stimulation of part of the PI3K/Akt/ P29474 pathway and inhibition of P27361 /2 phosphorylation and insulin-induced ET-1 secretion , probably in the MAPK pathway , which results in vasodilatation .
