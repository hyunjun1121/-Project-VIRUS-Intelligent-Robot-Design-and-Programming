Tetrandrine inhibits proinflammatory cytokines , P35228 and P35354 expression in human monocytic cells . Tetrandrine ( TET ) , a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the dried root of hang-fang-chi ( Stephania tetrandra S. Moore ) , is traditionally used in China for treating inflammation , hypertension and silicosis . In this study , our aim was to examine the anti-inflammatory mechanism of TET through measuring the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , cyclooxygenase-1 , and -2 ( P23219 and P35354 ) expression , cytokines ( P01375 , P05112 and P10145 ) formation , nitric oxide ( NO ) release and prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) generation in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced human monocytic ( THP-1 ) cells . Results showed that TET remarkably suppressed the LPS ( 1 microg/ml ) induction of NO release and DB00917 generation . It also significantly attenuated the LPS-induced transcription of proinflammatory cytokines ( P01375 , P05112 and P10145 ) in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore , TET at 100 microM significantly blocked the LPS induction of P35228 and P35354 expression , but not the P23219 . Taken together , these results suggest that TET exerts anti-inflammatory effects probably through the suppression of P35354 and P35228 expression .
