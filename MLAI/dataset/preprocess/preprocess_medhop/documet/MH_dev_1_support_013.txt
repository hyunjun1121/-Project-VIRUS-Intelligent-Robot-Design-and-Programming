Proteomic analysis for the identification of proteins related to methotrexate resistance . DB00563 (MTX) is one of the most important and frequently used drugs in cancer therapy , but the efficacy of this drug is often compromised by the development of resistance in cancer cells . To seek and identify differentially expressed proteins related to MTX resistance and provide clues for the mechanism of MTX resistance , proteins from cell line MTX300 ( resistant to 300 micromol/L MTX ) and its control cell line 3T3R500 were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-DE ) . The colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue-stained 2-DE gels were subjected to image analysis , which revealed several spots with high levels of differential expression between MTX300 and 3T3R500 . The protein spot with highest differential expression was submitted for tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting(PMF) for identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF-MS ) . MS analysis and database searches revealed it to be dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , which was subsequently confirmed by Western blot . The result suggested that P00374 might play an important role in the MTX resistance .
