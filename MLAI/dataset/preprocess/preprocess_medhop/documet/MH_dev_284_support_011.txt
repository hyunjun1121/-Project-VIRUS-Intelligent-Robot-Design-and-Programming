Caenorhabditis elegans expressed sequence tags identify gene families and potential disease gene homologues . A database containing mapped partial cDNA sequences from Caenorhabditis elegans will provide a ready starting point for identifying nematode homologues of important human genes and determining their functions in C. elegans . A total of 720 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) have been generated from 585 clones randomly selected from a mixed-stage C. elegans cDNA library . Comparison of these ESTs with sequence databases identified 422 new C. elegans genes , of which 317 are not similar to any sequences in the database . Twenty-six new genes have been mapped by YAC clone hybridization . Members of several gene families , including cuticle collagens , GTP-binding proteins , and RNA helicases were discovered . Many of the new genes are similar to known or potential human disease genes , including P13569 and the P01130 .
