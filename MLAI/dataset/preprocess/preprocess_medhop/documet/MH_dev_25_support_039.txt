Suppression of IL-12 production by soluble P29965 : evidence for involvement of the Q8TCB0 /42 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . IL-12 is a key cytokine in skewing immune responses toward Th1-like reactions . Human monocytes/macrophages produce high amounts of bioactive IL-12 when a priming signal ( P01579 or GM- P04141 ) precedes a second signal ( e.g. , LPS ) . We and others have previously shown that preincubation with LPS before this stimulation procedure can efficiently and selectively suppress the production of IL-12 by human monocytes . In this study , we show that an almost complete suppression of IL-12 production can also be observed after preincubation of monocytes with costimulatory cell surface molecules that bind to members of the TNFR superfamily ( P29965 , O14788 ( O14788 ) ) . The suppression of IL-12 was observable on the mRNA and protein levels and was not due to endogenous production of known IL-12 antagonists ( i.e. , P22301 , P05112 , and PGE(2) ) , to an increased number of cells undergoing apoptosis , nor to down-regulation of the P01579 or P25942 receptor . Cell surface expression of the costimulatory molecules P33681 and P42081 was not reduced by the preincubation procedure , and only a moderate reduction of P05231 production was observed . Several studies have identified signal transduction pathways that are activated by P25942 signaling , including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases . The presence of the extracellular signal-related kinase-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-specific inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 abrogated suppression induced by sCD40 ligand or other second signals . This indicates that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 contributes to the underlying mechanism of IL-12 suppression . This mechanism may be relevant in other inflammatory responses and may help to develop therapeutic strategies in Th1-mediated diseases .
