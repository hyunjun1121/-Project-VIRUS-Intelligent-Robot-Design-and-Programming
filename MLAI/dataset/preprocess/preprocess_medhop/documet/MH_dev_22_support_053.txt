DB05773 : a clinical update of the novel antibody-drug conjugate for P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer . DB00072 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against the P04626 tyrosine kinase receptor . Although trastuzumab is a very active agent in P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer , the majority of patients with metastatic P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer who initially respond to trastuzumab develop resistance within 1 year of initiation of treatment and , in the adjuvant setting , progress despite trastuzumab-based therapy . The antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) was designed to combine the biological activity of trastuzumab with the targeted delivery of a highly potent antimicrotubule agent , DM1 ( N-methyl-N-[3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl]-l-alanine ester of maytansinol ) , a maytansine derivative , to P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer cells . DB05773 is the first antibody-drug conjugate with a nonreducible thioether linker in clinical trials . Phase I and II clinical trials of DB05773 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel and pertuzumab have shown clinical activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Two randomized phase III trials of DB05773 are awaiting final results ; the EMILIA trial is evaluating DB05773 compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine , and early positive results have been reported . The MARIANNE trial is evaluating DB05773 plus placebo versus DB05773 plus pertuzumab versus trastuzumab plus a taxane . Here , we summarize evidence from clinical studies and discuss the potential clinical implications of DB05773 .
