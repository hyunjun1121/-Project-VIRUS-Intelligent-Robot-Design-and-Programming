Requirement of methotrexate in combination with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy for adequate suppression of osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis . OBJECTIVE : To determine that concomitant use of methotrexate ( MTX ) is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction in treating rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) -inhibiting biologic therapy . We quantitatively compared the suppressive effects of treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX and treatment with each of these 2 agents alone on bone destruction in SCID-HuRAg-pit mice . METHODS : Tissue derived from human RA pannus was implanted with a slice of dentin subcutaneously in the backs of SCID mice ( SCID-HuRAg-pit model ) . DB00065 was administered daily to SCID-HuRAg-pit mice using an osmotic pump for 2 weeks with or without oral administration of MTX . Histological changes in tissue and the pits formed on the dentin slice were examined 8 weeks after transplant . Serum concentrations of P01375 and interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) were also measured . RESULTS : Treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX suppressed pit formation significantly , while treatment with neither infliximab alone nor MTX alone had a significant effect on pit formation . Synovial inflammation and serum P01375 and P05231 levels were suppressed by infliximab with or without MTX . CONCLUSION : This is the first evidence in an animal model of arthritis that concomitant use of MTX is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction when treating RA with a P01375 -inhibiting biologic . Our findings suggest that infliximab suppresses bone destruction through a mechanism of action different from that mediating its antiinflammatory effects in the treatment of RA .
