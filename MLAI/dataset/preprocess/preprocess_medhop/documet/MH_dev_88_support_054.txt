Additional metabolic effects of adding P10912 antagonist to long-acting somatostatin analog in patients with active acromegaly . OBJECTIVE : Somatostatin analogs , dopamine agonists and GH-receptor antagonist -- pegvisomant are used in medical therapy of acromegaly . Since pegvisomant has not antitumor effect , the combination of pegvisomant and somatostatin analog could be an attractive option . Aim of study was to assess the effects of pegvisomant and octreotide P10586 treatment on GH and DB01277 levels , and glucose tolerance in acromegaly , and to assess efficacy and tolerability of rapid ( after 7 days ) pegvisomant dose titration . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Six patients ( 4 men , 2 women ) aged 47.5 years ( median ) with active acromegaly , after neurosurgery failed , resistant to maximal doses of octreotide , received daily 10-20 mg pegvisomant throughout 2 weeks . They were given octreotide P10586 30 mg monthly for at least 6 months before pegvisomant therapy . Clinical symptoms , GH , DB01277 , fasting glucose and insulin levels were measured on the 0 , 8th and 15th day of pegvisomant therapy . On the 8th day pegvisomant dose was titrated based on serum DB01277 level . RESULTS : DB01277 levels reduced from 739 at the beginning to 418 ng/ml ( medians ) on the 15th day of treatment and normalized in one patient . These changes were associated with improvement of glucose metabolism . One diabetic patient could even stop insulin therapy . CONCLUSIONS : DB00082 is an attractive adjuvant therapy for controlling acromegaly . DB00082 improves insulin sensitivity as well as glucose tolerance . The P10912 antagonist is good option for patients with active acromegaly coexistent with disturbances of glucose metabolism , especially with diabetes mellitus . Rapid pegvisomant dose increasing to efficient or maximal is well tolerated and effective .
