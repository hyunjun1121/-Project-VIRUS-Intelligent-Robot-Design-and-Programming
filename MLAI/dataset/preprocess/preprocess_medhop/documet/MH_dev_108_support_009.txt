Safety and efficacy of ustekinumab or DB06674 in patients with chronic sarcoidosis . Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating granulomas that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines , including interleukin ( IL ) -12 , IL-23 , and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α . Ustekinumab and DB06674 are monoclonal antibodies that specifically inhibit IL-12/IL-23 and P01375 -α , respectively . Patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis ( lung group ) and/or skin sarcoidosis ( skin group ) received either 180 mg ustekinumab at week 0 followed by 90 mg every 8 weeks , 200 mg DB06674 at week 0 followed by 100 mg every 4 weeks , or placebo . Patients underwent corticosteroid tapering between weeks 16 and 28 . The primary end-point was week 16 change in percentage predicted forced vital capacity ( ΔFVC % pred ) in the lung group . Major secondary end-points were : week 28 for ΔFVC % pred , 6-min walking distance , St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( lung group ) , and Skin Physician Global Assessment response ( skin group ) . At week 16 , no significant differences were observed in ΔFVC % pred with ustekinumab ( -0.15 , p = 0.13 ) or DB06674 ( 1.15 , p = 0.54 ) compared with placebo ( 2.02 ) . At week 28 , there were no significant improvements in the major secondary end-points , although a nonsignificant numerically greater Skin Physician Global Assessment response was observed following DB06674 treatment ( 53 % ) when compared with the placebo ( 30 % ) . Serious adverse events were similar in all treatment groups . Although treatment was well tolerated , neither ustekinumab nor DB06674 demonstrated efficacy in pulmonary sarcoidosis . However , trends towards improvement were observed with DB06674 in some dermatological end-points .
