Hexarelin suppresses high lipid diet and vitamin D3-induced atherosclerosis in the rat . Growth hormone-releasing peptides ( Q92847 ) and ghrelin are synthetic and natural ligands of growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( Q92847 ) respectively and are shown to exert protective actions on cardiac dysfunction . Because ghrelin has been reported to inhibit proinflammatory responses in human endothelium and Q92847 has been identified in blood vessels , we hypothesized that Q92847 could alleviate the development of atherosclerosis ( As ) . Atherosclearosis was induced by a short period ( 4 days ) of vitamin D(3) and chronic ( three months ) intragastric feeding of high fat emulsion ( containing 0.5 % propylthiouracil ) in adult SD rats . Some As rats received chronic hexarelin ( a variant of Q92847 ) injection ( SC P55957 , 30 days ) and normal rats received placebo as control . Significant atherosclerosis developed in animals fed with the emulsion . Serum total cholesterol and LDL-c increased , and HDL-c and aortic nitric oxide ( NO ) decreased significantly in As group . Hexarelin suppressed the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and neointima , partially reversed serum HDL-c/LDL-c ratio and increased the levels of serum NO and aortic mRNAs of P29474 , Q92847 and P16671 in As rats . Hexarelin also decreased [ (3)H ] -TdR incorporation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) and calcium sedimentation in aortic wall . Furthermore , foam cell formation induced by ox-LDL was decreased by hexarelin . In conclusion , hexarelin suppresses high lipid diet and vitamin D3-induced atherosclerosis in rats , possibly through upregulating HDL-c/LDL-c ratio , vascular NO production and downregulating the VSMC proliferation , aortic calcium sedimentation and foam cell formation . These novel anti-atherosclerotic actions of hexarelin suggest that the peptide might have a clinical potential in treating atherosclerosis .
