Association of polymorphisms in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene ( P43681 ) , mu-opioid receptor gene ( P35372 ) , and ethanol-metabolizing enzyme genes with alcoholism in Korean patients . Findings obtained from several studies indicate that ethanol enhances the activity of alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and support the possibility that a polymorphism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit gene ( P43681 ) modulates enhancement of nicotinic receptor function by ethanol . To identify the association between the CfoI polymorphism of the P43681 and alcoholism , we examined distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies in Korean patients diagnosed with alcoholism ( n = 127 ) and Korean control subjects without alcoholism ( n = 185 ) with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods . We were able to detect the association between the CfoI polymorphism of the P43681 and alcoholism in Korean patients ( genotype P = .023 ; allele frequency P = .047 ) . The genotypes and allele frequencies of known polymorphisms in other alcoholism candidate genes , such as alcohol metabolism-related genes [ alcohol dehydrogenase 2 ( P00325 ) , aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( P05091 ) , alcohol dehydrogenase 3 ( P00326 ) , and cytochrome P450 2E1 ( P05181 ) ] and mu-opioid receptor gene ( P35372 ) , were studied . The polymorphisms of P00325 , P05091 , and P05181 were significantly different in Korean patients with alcoholism and Korean control subjects without alcoholism , but P00326 and P35372 did not differ between the two groups .
