Cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin expression in human breast cancer cell lines : relationship to morphology and invasive capacities . Loss of cell-cell adhesion in carcinoma cells may be an important step in the acquisition of an invasive , metastatic phenotype . We have examined the expression of the epithelial-specific cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin ( P12830 , cell- P12830 , L- P62158 ) in human breast cancer cell lines . We find that fibroblastoid , highly invasive , vimentin-expressing breast cancer cell lines do not express uvomorulin . Of the more epithelial-appearing , less invasive , keratin-expressing breast cancer cell lines , some express uvomorulin , and some do not . We examined the morphologies of the cell lines in the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel and measured the ability of the cells to traverse a Matrigel-coated filter as in vitro models for detachment of carcinoma cells from neighboring cells and invasion through basement membrane into surrounding tissue . Colonies of uvomorulin-positive cells have a characteristic fused appearance in Matrigel , whereas uvomorulin-negative cells appear detached . Cells which are uvomorulin negative and vimentin positive have a stellate morphology in Matrigel . We show that uvomorulin is responsible for the fused colony morphology in Matrigel since treatment of uvomorulin-positive MCF-7 cells with an antibody to uvomorulin caused the cells to detach from one another but did not induce invasiveness in these cells , as measured by their ability to cross a Matrigel-coated polycarbonate filter in a modified Boyden chamber assay . Two uvomorulin-negative , vimentin-negative cell lines are also not highly invasive as measured by this assay . We suggest that loss of uvomorulin-mediated cell-cell adhesion may be one of many changes involved in the progression of a carcinoma cell to an invasive phenotype .
