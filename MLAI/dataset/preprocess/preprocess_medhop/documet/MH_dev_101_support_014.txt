Holocarboxylase synthetase interacts physically with nuclear receptor co-repressor , histone deacetylase 1 and a novel splicing variant of histone deacetylase 1 to repress repeats . P50747 ( holocarboxylase synthetase ) is a nuclear protein that catalyses the binding of biotin to distinct lysine residues in chromatin proteins . P50747 -dependent epigenetic marks are over-represented in repressed genomic loci , particularly in repeats . Evidence is mounting that P50747 is a member of a multi-protein gene repression complex , which determines its localization in chromatin . In the present study we tested the hypothesis that P50747 interacts physically with O75376 ( nuclear receptor co-repressor ) and Q13547 ( histone deacetylase 1 ) , thereby contributing toward the removal of H3K9ac ( Lys‚Åπ-acetylated histone H3 ) gene activation marks and the repression of repeats . Physical interactions between P50747 and O75376 , Q13547 and a novel splicing variant of Q13547 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation , limited proteolysis and split luciferase complementation assays . When P50747 was overexpressed , the abundance of H3K9ac marks decreased by 50 % and 68 % in LTRs ( long terminal repeats ) 15 and 22 respectively in P29320 ( human embryonic kidney ) -293 cells compared with the controls . This loss of H3K9ac marks was linked with an 83 % decrease in mRNA coding for LTRs . Similar patterns were seen in pericentromeric alpha satellite repeats in chromosomes 1 and 4 . We conclude that interactions of P50747 with O75376 and HDACs contribute towards the transcriptional repression of repeats , presumably increasing genome stability .
