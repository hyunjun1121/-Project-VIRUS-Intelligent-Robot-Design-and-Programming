Intracellular retention and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor , two distinct processes mediated by benzoquinone ansamycins . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) stimulates the growth of various types of cells via its cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor . The P01133 receptor ( P01133 -R ) has an oncogenic potential when overexpressed in a wide range of tumor cells . DB02424 ( GA ) and herbimycin ( HA ) , specific inhibitors of the cytosolic chaperone P08238 and its endoplasmic reticulum homologue GRP 94 , were shown to accelerate degradation of the P01133 -R and of its homologue p185(c-)(erbB-2) . Here we compared the effects of GA and HA on intracellular degradation and maturation of P01133 -R . By using an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation , we learned that GA , but not HA , blocks processing of newly synthesized P01133 -R . The effects of GA and HA on receptor degradation are mediated by the cytosolic portion of P01133 -R and could be conferred to the erythropoietin receptor ( P19235 ) , by employing the respective chimera . Neither HA nor GA affected stability of newly synthesized P01133 -R lacking the cytosolic domain ( Ex P01133 -R ) , but GA caused intracellular retention of this mutant . Taken together , our results imply that GA has two distinct targets of action on the P01133 -R , one for promoting its degradation and another for mediating its intracellular retention . Apparently , degradation of the P01133 -R mediated by GA or HA requires the presence of the P01133 -R cytosolic domain , whereas intracellular retention in the presence of GA is coupled to the extracellular domain of the P01133 -R .
