Sodium butyrate decreases the activation of NF-κB reducing inflammation and oxidative damage in the kidney of rats subjected to contrast-induced nephropathy . BACKGROUND : Contrast-induced nephropathy ( Q96GD0 ) is associated with a combination of hypoxic and toxic renal tubular damage , renal endothelial dysfunction and altered intra-renal microcirculation . Recently , sodium butyrate ( SB ) has been focused on since it possesses anti-inflammatory activities . Thus , based on the lack of information on the effects of SB in acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , we investigated the possible effects of SB after Q96GD0 in rats . METHODS : Wistar rats were divided into three groups : ( 1 sham ) control , ( 2 MI ) AKI treated with contrast medium and ( 3 MI + SB ) AKI plus SB . Six days after contrast administration , blood and kidney were removed for the determination of creatinine , interleukin ( IL ) -6 levels , oxidative damage parameters and histologic analyses . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) , pIκBα and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( P50552 ) protein content were determined by immunoblotting . RESULTS : After 6 days , the levels of creatinine increased significantly in the MI group , and this was attenuated using SB . SB treatment was associated with a decrease on the levels of lipid peroxidation , but not the protein oxidation , and P05231 levels , as well as tubular damage . These effects are probably mediated , in part , by a decrease on the activation of NF-κB in the kidney , but not alteration in pVASP content . CONCLUSIONS : The current experiment suggests that NF-κB induced an inflammatory response after Q96GD0 and SB could inhibit NF-κB expression protecting against Q96GD0 in rats .
