DB00203 induces angiogenic response in human coronary arteriolar endothelial cells through the expression of thioredoxin , hemeoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor . This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of phosphodiesterase-5 ( O76074 ) inhibitor , sildenafil , on angiogenic response in human coronary arteriolar endothelial cells ( HCAEC ) . The cells exposed to sildenafil ( 1-20 microM ) demonstrated significantly accelerated tubular morphogenesis with the induction of thioredoxin-1 ( P10599 -1 ) , hemeoxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) and P15692 . DB00203 induced P15692 and angiopoietin specific receptors such as P35968 , Tie-1 and Tie-2 . This angiogenic response was repressed by tinprotoporphyrin IX ( SnPP ) , an inhibitor of P09601 enzyme activity . DB00203 below 1 muM has no angiogenic effect as evidenced by reduced tuborogenesis . DB00203 along with SnPP inhibited both P15692 and Q15389 ( Ang-1 ) protein expression . Therefore our results demonstrated for the first time that sildenafil is a very potent pro-angiogenic factor .
