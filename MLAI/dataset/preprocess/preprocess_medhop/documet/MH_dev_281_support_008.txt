Association of dopamine-related gene alleles , smoking behavior and decline in FEV1 in subjects with P48444 : findings from the lung health study . Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . Specific dopamine related gene alleles have previously been found to be associated with smoking initiation , maintenance and cessation . We investigated the association between specific dopamine related gene alleles and both change in smoking behavior and lung function change over time in individuals with mild-to-moderate P48444 . Subjects included a subset of participants in the Lung Health Study ( LHS ) , a smoking intervention study in smokers with mild to moderate P48444 . Smoking status was determined and lung function performed at baseline and annually for 5 years . In post-hoc analyses , we assessed the association of the dopamine receptor ( P14416 ) TaqI A1(+) allele ( A1A1 , A1A2 genotypes ) and A1(-) allele ( A2A2 genotype ) , and the dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) 9R(+) allele ( 9R9R and 9R10R genotypes ) and 9R(-) allele ( 10R10R genotype ) with both changes in smoking status and lung function in a subset of LHS subjects . No significant associations were noted between variants in these genes and success in smoking cessation . However , in exploratory analyses that did not adjust for multiple comparisons , sustained male ( but not female ) quitters with the P14416 A1(-) allele and/or the Q01959 9R(+) allele showed an accelerated decline in Q99581 (1) similar to that of continuing smokers over 5 years after quitting smoking . These preliminary findings suggest that dopamine-related genes may play a role in the progression of P48444 , at least in the subset of male ex-smokers whose disease continues to progress despite sustained quitting , and warrants additional confirmatory and mechanistic studies .
