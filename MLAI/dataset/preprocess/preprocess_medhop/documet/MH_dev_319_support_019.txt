The c- DB00134 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor DB05216 radiosensitizes glioblastoma cells . PURPOSE : Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is resistant to current cytotoxic therapies , in part because of enhanced DNA repair . Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- DB00134 has been shown to protect cancer cells from DNA damage . We hypothesized that inhibiting c- DB00134 would decrease this protection and thus sensitize resistant tumor cells to the effects of radiation therapy . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eight human GBM cell lines were screened for radiosensitivity to the small-molecule c- DB00134 inhibitor DB05216 with colony-count assays . Double-strand ( ds ) DNA breaks was quantified by using antibodies to gamma P16104 . Western blotting demonstrate expression of Q06609 , glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK ) -3beta , and other proteins . A murine xenograft tumor flank model was used for in vivo radiosensitization studies . RESULTS : DB05216 reduced c- DB00134 phosphorylation and enhanced radiation-induced cell kill by 0.4 logs in SF767 cells . Cells pretreated with DB05216 had more ds DNA damage than cells treated with radiation alone . Mechanistically , DB05216 was shown to inhibit dsDNA break repair and increase apoptosis . DB05216 influences various survival and DNA repair related proteins such as pAKT , Q06609 and GSK3beta . In vivo , the addition of DB05216 to radiation resulted in a tumor-growth-delay enhancement ratio of 2.9 over radiation alone and extended survival time . CONCLUSIONS : GBM is a disease site where radiation is often used to address both macroscopic and microscopic disease . Despite attempts at dose escalation outcomes remain poor . DB05216 , a potent small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c- DB00134 , radiosensitized several GBM cell lines both in vitro and in vivo , and may help to improve outcomes for patients with GBM .
