P13726 and factor VIIa as therapeutic targets in disorders of hemostasis . For hemophilia patients with inhibitors against FVIII or FIX , the development of recombinant factor VIIa ( DB00036 ) raises the possibility of a therapeutic alternative whose availability and convenience of treatment are comparable to those of FVIII or FIX . In support of this new concept for the treatment of bleeding episodes , pharmacological doses of FVIIa have been shown to induce hemostasis . Pharmacological doses of DB00036 enhance thrombin generation on thrombin-activated platelets , thereby facilitating the formation of strong , well-structured fibrin plugs resistant to premature proteolysis . Modified DB00036 molecules with a stronger hemostatic potential have been produced . Inhibition of the FVII-TF-dependent pathway ( P10646 and rFVIIai ) has been tried in attempts to prevent thrombosis , with promising results in animal models so far not confirmed in clinical trials .
