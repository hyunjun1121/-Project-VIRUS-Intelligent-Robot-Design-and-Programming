A case of a novel mutant vasopressin receptor-dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with bilateral non-obstructive hydronephrosis in a middle aged man : differentiation from aquaporin-dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by response of factor VII and P04275 to 1-diamino-8-arginine vasopressin administration . We describe a case of a novel mutant vasopressin 2 receptor ( P30518 ) -dependent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) with bilateral non-obstructive hydronephrosis in a middle aged man . This could be distinguished from aquaporin 2 ( P41181 ) -dependent NDI by the response of factor VIII and P04275 ( P04275 ) to DB00035 ( DB00035 ) administration . A 47-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of polyuria , which had been present from infancy and was suspected of causing non-obstructive hydronephrosis . DB00117 mother 's father , the older brother of his mother and his second daughter also all had polyuria . Sodium concentration , osmolality and vasopressin in blood were high , while sodium concentration and osmolality in urine were low . There were no changes in urine osmolality , factor VIII and P04275 in response to DB00035 infusion . Neither was heart rate , diastolic blood pressure nor facial flushing affected . These findings suggested this case was P30518 -dependent NDI rather than P41181 -dependent NDI . Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated that the patient had a P30518 missense mutation involving a substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 104 ( R104C ) located in the first extracellular loop of the P30518 . It was also found that the patient 's mother and his second daughter were heterozygous for this R104C mutation .
