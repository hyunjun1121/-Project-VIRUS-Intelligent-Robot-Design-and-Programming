P01375 induces P15941 gene transcription in lung epithelial cells : its signaling pathway and biological implication . The current study was conducted to elucidate the mechanism through which P01375 stimulates expression of P15941 , a membrane-tethered mucin . A549 human lung alveolar cells treated with P01375 exhibited significantly higher P15941 protein levels in detergent lysates compared with cells treated with vehicle alone . Increased P15941 protein levels were correlated with significantly higher levels of P15941 mRNA in P01375 -treated cells compared with controls . However , P01375 did not alter P15941 transcript stability , implying increased de novo transcription induced by the cytokine . P01375 increased P15941 gene promoter activity in A549 cells transfected with a promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid . Both U0126 , an inhibitor of Q02750 /2 , and dominant negative P27361 prevented P01375 -induced P15941 promoter activation , and anti- P19438 antibody blocked P01375 -stimulated P27361 /2 activation . P15941 promoter activation by P01375 also was blocked by mithramycin A , an inhibitor of Sp1 , as well as either deletion or mutation of a putative Sp1 binding site in the P15941 promoter located between nucleotides -99 and -90 . P01375 -stimulated binding of Sp1 to the P15941 promoter in intact cells was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay . We conclude that P01375 induces P15941 gene transcription through a P19438 --> Q02750 /2 --> P27361 --> Sp1 pathway .
