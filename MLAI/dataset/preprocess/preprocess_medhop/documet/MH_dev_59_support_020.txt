Nongenomic , glucocorticoid receptor-mediated regulation of serotonin transporter cell surface expression in embryonic stem cell derived serotonergic neurons . Depressive disorders have been linked to the combined dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) -axis and the serotonergic system . The Q9Y251 -axis and serotonergic ( 5-HT ) neurons exert reciprocal regulatory actions . It has been reported that glucocorticoid-glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) signaling influences serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) transcription but data also points to the fact that 5-HTT expression is regulated nongenomically via redistribution of 5-HTT from the cell surface into intracellular compartments . In order to analyze the acute effects of glucocorticoids on 5-HTT cell surface localization we differentiated serotonergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells derived from the C57BL/6N blastocysts . These postmitotic 5-HT neurons express all relevant serotonergic markers following the application of a growth factor-based differentiation protocol . Increasing concentrations of the GR agonist dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) resulted in enhanced , dose-dependent 5-HTT cell surface localization in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide already 1h after incubation . Inhibition of GR function by the specific GR-antagonist mifepristone abolished the increase in 5-HTT cell surface localization . Hence , our data account for a nongenomic upregulation of 5-HTT cell surface expression by glucocorticoid-GR interaction which likely constitutes a rapid physiological response to increased levels of glucocorticoids as seen during stress . Taken together , we provide a cellular model to analyze and dissect glucocorticoid- P31645 interactions on a molecular level that corresponds to in vivo animal models using C57BL/6N mice .
