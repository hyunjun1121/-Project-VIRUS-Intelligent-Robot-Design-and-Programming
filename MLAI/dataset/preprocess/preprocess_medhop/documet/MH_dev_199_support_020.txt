DB06693 and simvastatin , but not pravastatin , induce bone morphogenetic protein-2 in human osteosarcoma cells . Bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) -2 , a member of the BMP family , plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation . To discover small molecules that induce P12643 , a luciferase reporter vector containing the 5'-flanking promoter region of the human P12643 gene was constructed and transfected into human osteosarcoma ( Q9UKB1 ) cells . By the screening of an in-house natural product library with stably transfected Q9UKB1 cells , a fungal metabolite , compactin , known as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , was isolated . The stimulation of the promoter activity by compactin seemed to be specific for P12643 gene in Q9UKB1 cells , since it had little effect on P12644 or SV40 promoter activity and the stimulation was not observed in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells . RT-PCR analysis and alkaline phosphatase assay revealed that compactin induced an increase in the expression of P12643 mRNA and protein . Like compactin , simvastatin also activated the P12643 promoter , whereas pravastatin did not . The statin-mediated activation of P12643 promoter was completely inhibited by the downstream metabolite of P04035 , mevalonate , indicating that the activation was a result of the inhibition of the enzyme . These results suggest that statins , if they are selectively targeted to bone , have beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoporosis or bone fracture .
