Polymorphisms influencing olanzapine metabolism and adverse effects in healthy subjects . OBJECTIVE : The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine and response to treatment could be affected by polymorphisms in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes , transporters , or receptors . The aim of this study was to identify genetic markers predictive of pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and adverse effects of olanzapine . METHODS : Sixty-three healthy volunteers receiving a single 5-mg oral dose of olanzapine were genotyped for 39 genetic variants that could be related to the response to olanzapine . All genetic variants were analyzed by PharmaChip , but P14416 Taq1A polymorphism was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction . Olanzapine was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry . The relationship of gender and polymorphisms with olanzapine pharmacokinetics , the change in prolactin levels , and the incidence of adverse effects were evaluated by multiple regression analysis . RESULTS : The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine was influenced by polymorphisms in P20815 , P21266 , and Q13224 . P01236 levels were affected by gender and polymorphisms in P14416 and 5- P28223 . Polymorphisms in P11712 , P51580 , P22309 , P08183 , and 5- P28223 were related to some adverse effects of olanzapine . CONCLUSIONS : Several polymorphisms can explain differences in the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and safety of olanzapine in healthy subjects . Whether these genetic factors influence the risk of therapeutic failure or tolerability in patients remains to be established .
