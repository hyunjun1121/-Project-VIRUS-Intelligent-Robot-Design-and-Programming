2(3H)-benzoxazolone and bioisosters as " privileged scaffold " in the design of pharmacological probes . The 2(3H)-benzoxazolone heterocycle and its bioisosteric surrogates ( such as 2(3H)-benzothiazolinone , benzoxazinone , etc. ) have received considerable attention from the medicinal chemists owing to their capacity to mimic a phenol or a catechol moiety in a metabolically stable template . These heterocycles and pyrocatechol have indeed similar pKa 's , electronic charge distribution , and chemical reactivity . Therapeutic applications of this template are very broad , and range from analgesic anti-inflammatory compounds ( including P37231 antagonists ) to antipsychotic and neuroprotective anticonvulsant compounds . High affinity ligands have been obtained also for dopaminergic ( D2 and D4 ) , serotoninergic ( P08908 and P28223 ) , sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors . Owing to the high number of positive hits encountered with this heterocycle and its congeners , 2(3H)-benzoxazolone template certainly deserves the title of " privileged scaffold " in medicinal chemistry .
