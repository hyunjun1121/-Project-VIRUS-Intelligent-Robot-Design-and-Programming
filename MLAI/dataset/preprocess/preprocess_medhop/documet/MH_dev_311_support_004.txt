Improving prediction of type 1 diabetes by testing non-HLA genetic variants in addition to HLA markers . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to explore whether non-human leukocyte antigen ( non-HLA ) genetic markers can improve type 1 diabetes(T1D) prediction in a prospective cohort with high-risk HLA-DR,DQ genotypes . METHODS : The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young ( DAISY ) follows prospectively for the development of T1D and islet autoimmunity (IA)children at increased genetic risk . A total of 1709 non-Hispanic White DAISY participants have been genotyped for 27 non-HLA single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and one microsatellite . RESULTS : In multivariate analyses adjusting for family history and HLA- Q93038 /4 genotype , Q9Y2R2 ( rs2476601 ) and two P57075 ( rs11203203 and rs9976767 ) SNPs were associated with development of IA [ hazard ratio(HR)=1.87 , 1.55 , and 1.54 , respectively , all p ≤ 0.003 ] , while Q8NEA6 and P01589 showed borderline association with development of IA . P01308 , P57075 , and Q9BYX4 were significantly associated with progression from IA to diabetes ( HR=1.65 , 1.44 , and 1.47 , respectively , all p ≤ 0.04 ) , while Q9Y2R2 and IL27 showed borderline association with progression from IA to diabetes . In survival analysis , 45 % of general population DAISY children with Q9Y2R2 rs2476601 TT or HLA- Q93038 /4 and P57075 rs11203203 AA developed diabetes by age 15 , compared with 3 % of children with all other genotypes ( p < 0.0001 ) . Addition of non-HLA markers to HLA- Q93038 /4,DQ8 did not improve diabetes prediction in first-degree relatives . CONCLUSION : Addition of Q9Y2R2 and P57075 SNPs to HLA-DR,DQ genotyping can improve T1D risk prediction .
