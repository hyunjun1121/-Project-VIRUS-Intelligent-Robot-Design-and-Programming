P42898 , Q99707 , and P11586 gene polymorphisms compared to homocysteine and asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations and their metabolites in epileptic patients treated with antiepileptic drugs . PURPOSE : The purpose of the study was to determine the frequency of occurrence of polymorphisms of genes P42898 ( C677T ) , Q99707 ( A2756G ) , and P11586 ( G1958A ) , as well as to analyze the concentration of homocysteine ( Hcy ) , methionine ( DB00134 ) , asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) , and arginine ( DB00125 ) in epileptics treatment with antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , and controls . METHOD : The study included 65 epileptic patients treated with variable AEDs and 61 controls . The levels of Hcy and DB00134 were determined by HPLC/EC , DB01686 and DB00125 by HPLC with fluorescence detection . Polymorphisms of the studied genes were determined by PCR-RFLP . RESULTS : The study demonstrates that AEDs treatment in epileptics leads to increase in Hcy ( p < 0.05 ) and DB01686 ( p < 0.01 ) concentrations . Greater increases in Hcy concentration during AEDs treatment appear to occur in individuals with the P42898 CT ( C677T ) and P11586 GG ( G1958A ) genotypes . Genetic conditions also appear to be related with changes in the ratios of Hcy , DB00134 , DB00125 , and DB01686 . It seems that in cases of AEDs treatment 's effect on hyperhomocysteinemia , epileptic individuals appear to have a disturbed control of Hcy over DB01686 . CONCLUSIONS : It is possible , that polymorphisms of genes related to Hcy-to- DB00134 metabolism , in epileptics treated with AEDs may have an effect on the regulation of levels of risk factors of vascular diseases , Hcy and DB01686 .
