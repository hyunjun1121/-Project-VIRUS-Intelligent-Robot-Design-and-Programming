P78423 activates a signal transduction pathway similar to Q9H244 and is associated with impaired clopidogrel responsiveness . OBJECTIVE : P78423 ( P78423 ) activates a G(αi) protein-coupled signaling pathway similar to the one activated by ADP via P2Y(12) , which is the drug target of clopidogrel . P78423 levels are increased under several disease conditions associated with impaired clopidogrel responsiveness . METHODS AND RESULTS : Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and from 40 patients under chronic clopidogrel treatment . P78423 reduced prostaglandin E1-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation by ≈ 25 % ( P < 0.01 ) at least partially mimicking the effect of ADP via P2Y(12) . In vitro , P78423 increased platelet reactivity index in clopidogrel-treated patients indicating potential activation of downstream targets of P2Y(12) . When stratifying patients by their P78423 levels , patients within the highest quartile of P78423 ( 2042 ± 25 pg/mL ) had the weakest response to clopidogrel ( platelet reactivity index , 68 ± 4 % ) , and patients within the lowest quartile ( 479 ± 50 pg/mL ) had the strongest response ( platelet reactivity index , 48 ± 7 % ; P=0.0106 ) . P78423 by itself induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation leading to Akt phosphorylation at DB00133 (473) ( P < 0.01 versus basal ) . CONCLUSIONS : In addition to desensitizing platelets to prostaglandin E1 via G(αi) , P78423 induces phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent Akt phosphorylation via a G(βγ) protein similar to ADP signaling through P2Y(12) . P78423 increased the platelet ADP response in clopidogrel-treated patients . Once released from an atherosclerotic lesion , this mechanism could contribute locally to impaired clopidogrel responsiveness at the vulnerable plaque .
