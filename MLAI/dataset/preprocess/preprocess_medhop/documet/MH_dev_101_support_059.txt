P04035 inhibitors deplete circulating classical and non-classical monocytes following human heart transplantation . BACKGROUND : Monocytes mediate immune responses following solid organ transplantation via cytokine secretion and differentiation to macrophage/dendritic cell lineages . To date , the pleiotropic immunomodulatory effect of statins on human monocytes following human heart transplantation has yet to be elucidated . This study was designed to assess the effects of statin administration on the monocyte repertoire . METHODS : 108 patients were recruited into the study . Clinical data were collected from patients ' notes . Peripheral blood immunophenotype was determined via flow cytometry ( using CD11c , P08571 , CD16 , CD49d , CD64 , P33681 and CD195 ) . RESULTS : There were fewer circulating classical ( p=0.0001 ) and non-classical ( p=0.0013 ) monocytes in patients treated with a statin . CD64 expression was down-regulated ( p=0.011 and p=0.049 ) whereas CD49d expression was up-regulated ( p=0.004 and p=0.022 ) on classical and non-classical monocytes in this group . Patients receiving DB01076 had fewer circulating classical monocytes ( p=0.001 ) compared to patients administered DB00175 . Patients receiving DB00175 had fewer circulating non-classical monocytes ( p=0.029 ) compared to patients administered DB01076 . DISCUSSION : Statin administration alters the circulating monocyte repertoire following heart transplantation , including population size , FcgammaRI and VLA-4 adhesion molecule expression . Furthermore , different statin treatments are associated with a selective depletion of macrophage or DC (re)generating monocytes .
