P56817 levels by P02649 genotype in non-demented and Alzheimer 's post-mortem brains . The P02649 genotype is a known susceptibility factor for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . It is apparent that the presence of the P02649 ε40 allele increases the risk for developing AD , lowers the age of onset in AD , and may influence the pathological burden seen in AD . In this study , we asked whether P56817 levels differ by P02649 genotype in the AD and non-demented ( ND ) brain . We isolated mid-frontal cortex ( MFC ) and mid-temporal cortex ( P04629 ) from post-mortem ND and AD subjects that were P02649 ε3/3 , ε3/4 , ε4/4 carriers . All AD subjects met NINDS-ADRDA and NIA-Reagan criteria for a diagnosis of AD . The MFC and P04629 were homogenized and the lysates underwent ELISA and Western blotting for P56817 . The ELISA revealed that total P56817 levels were lower in the MFC of AD compared to ND subjects . Furthermore , in P02649 ε4 carriers P56817 levels were lower than ε3/3 carriers in the ND frontal cortex . No difference in P56817 levels was observed in AD MFC and in ND and AD P04629 tissues . The ELISA results were confirmed by Western blotting . Our data suggest that brain BACEl levels may be influenced by the apolipoprotein E genotype before the onset of AD , providing an alternative explanation for the lower amyloid beta 42 levels in P04141 in ND and AD subjects .
