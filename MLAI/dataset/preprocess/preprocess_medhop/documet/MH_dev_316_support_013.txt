Lack of glibenclamide response in a case of permanent neonatal diabetes caused by incomplete inactivation of glucokinase . BACKGROUND : Hypoglycaemic drugs that close the KATP channel have been tested in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes due to glucokinase mutations ( PNDM-GCK ) . From the results obtained , it has been suggested that this treatment may be beneficial in patients carrying GCK mutations with mild kinetic defects . The aim of this study was to evaluate the kinetic analysis of glucokinase activity as a predictive factor for response to sulphonylureas in PNDM-GCK . METHODS : The clinical characteristics of two siblings with PNDM born to non-consanguineous parents are described . Mutation analysis of Q14654 , P01308 and GCK genes was done by sequencing . A comprehensive functional characterisation of GCK mutation was undertaken . DB01016 treatment was assayed for 16 weeks in one child . Response to treatment was evaluated by means of fasting glycaemia , C-peptide and HbA1c levels . RESULTS : Compound heterozygous GCK mutations ( p.Ile19Asn and p.Ser441Trp ) were identified . Functional analysis of GCK(p.Ile19Asn) indicated that this mutant retained more than 70 % of wild-type catalytic activity in vitro , with a slight increase of thermolability . This mutation did not impair the interaction with the glucokinase regulatory protein , and the enzymatic activity of the GCK(p.Ile19Asn) mutant is restored to wild-type levels in the presence of GCK allosteric activator LY2121260 . However , glibenclamide treatment of the patient on a reduced dose of insulin did not reduce HbA1c levels , and C-peptide increased only very slightly . CONCLUSION : Hypoglycaemic drugs acting on the KATP channel might not be useful in the treatment of PNDM-GCK , even in patients carrying GCK mutations with mild kinetic defects .
