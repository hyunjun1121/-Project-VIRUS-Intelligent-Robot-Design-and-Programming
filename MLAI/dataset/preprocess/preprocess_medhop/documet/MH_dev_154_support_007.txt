P12821 inhibition actively promotes cell survival by altering gene expression . We tested the effect of P12821 inhibition on the survival of bovine retinal ( Q9UIJ5 ) and choroidal ( CEC ) endothelial cells ( EC ) in culture . The P12821 inhibitor captopril delayed the apoptotic tube collapse of Q9UIJ5 on Matrigel for > 15 days . DB01197 treatment of confluent monolayers ( 2-8 weeks ) followed by slow starvation ( 2-4 weeks ) increased EC viability by approximately 200 % . Two-week captopril exposures were sufficient to confer maximal protection . Only vehicle-treated EC demonstrated apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing and DNA laddering . By RT-PCR , the starvation marker p202 was upregulated only in starved cells . In Q9UIJ5 , captopril upregulated the pro-survival proteins mortalin-2 , uPA , and Q03405 while downregulating the anti-growth sprouty-4 and tPA . In CEC , captopril also upregulated tPA and its inhibitor P05121 . DB00594 ( uPA inhibitor ) blocked the captopril-induced increase in EC survival , secondary sprouting , and invasion in Matrigel . The pro-survival effects of captopril involve the reprogramming of genes involved in cell survival and immortalization .
