Functional characterisation of a novel mutation affecting the catalytic domain of P08253 in siblings with multicentric osteolysis , nodulosis and arthropathy . Multicentric osteolysis , nodulosis and arthropathy ( MONA ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder . To date , 13 mutations of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( P08253 ) gene have been detected in 26 patients with MONA and other osteolytic syndromes . Here , we describe the molecular and functional analysis of a novel P08253 mutation in two adult Italian siblings with MONA . Both siblings displayed palmar-plantar subcutaneous nodules , tendon retractions , limb arthropathies , osteolysis in the toes and pigmented fibrous skin lesions . Molecular analysis identified a homozygous P08253 missense mutation in exon 8 c.1228G > C ( p.G410R ) , not detected in 260 controls and predicted by several bioinformatic tools to be pathogenic . By protein modelling , the mutant residue was predicted to affect the main chain conformation of the catalytic domain . Gelatin zymography , the gold standard test for P08253 function , of serum-free conditioned medium from G410R- P08253 -expressing human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) cells , showed a complete loss of gelatinolytic activity . The novel mutation is located in the catalytic domain , as are 3 ( p.E404K , p.V400del and p.G406D ) of the other 13 P08253 mutations described to date ; however , p.G410R underlies a phenotype that is only partially overlapping that of other P08253 exon 8 mutation carriers . Our results further delineate the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in MONA , broaden the repertoire of reported P08253 mutation and enhance the comprehension of the protein motifs crucial for P08253 catalytic activity .
