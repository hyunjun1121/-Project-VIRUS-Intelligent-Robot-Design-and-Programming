Enhanced immune system regeneration in humans following allogeneic or autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation by temporary sex steroid blockade . PURPOSE : To determine if temporarily blocking sex steroids prior to stem cell transplantation can increase thymus function and thus enhance the rate of T cell regeneration . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : This was a pilot study of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist ( P01148 -A ) goserelin given 3 weeks prior to allogeneic or autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation and administered up to 3 months posttransplantation . Patients ( with or without P01148 -A administration ) were assessed from 1 week to 12 months posttransplantation for multiple immunologic variables by flow cytometry ( particularly naïve T cells ) , quantitative PCR to assess T-cell receptor excision circle levels ( as a correlate of thymus function ) , CDR3 length analysis to determine the variability of the TCR repertoire , and in vitro assays to determine functional T cell responses . RESULTS : P01148 -A administration prior to stem cell transplantation significantly increased neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers within the first month of posttransplantation . Most importantly , total and naïve P01730 (+) T cell regeneration together with T-cell receptor excision circle production , T cell repertoire regeneration , and peripheral T cell function were also significantly enhanced at multiple time points posttransplant . In addition , an increase in disease-free survival ( P = 0.04 ) was seen in the autologous setting . Although P01148 -A administration increased T cell responses in vitro , it did not exacerbate graft-versus-host disease in the allogeneic setting . CONCLUSIONS : This study provides an important new approach to the improvement of immune reconstitution in patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation and may have generic applications in many T cell-based disorders .
