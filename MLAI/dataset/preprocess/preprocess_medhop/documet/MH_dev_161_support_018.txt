Preclinical to clinical translation of tofacitinib , a Janus kinase inhibitor , in rheumatoid arthritis . A critical piece in the translation of preclinical studies to clinical trials is the determination of dosing regimens that allow maximum therapeutic benefit with minimum toxicity . The preclinical pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile of tofacitinib , an oral Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis ( mCIA ) model was compared with clinical PK/PD data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Preclinical evaluations included target modulation and PK/PD modeling based on continuous subcutaneous infusion or oral once- or twice-daily ( P55957 ) dosing paradigms in mice . The human PK/PD profile was obtained from pooled data from four phase 2 studies in patients with RA , and maximal effect models were used to evaluate efficacy after 12 weeks of tofacitinib treatment ( 1-15 mg P55957 ) . In mCIA , the main driver of efficacy was inhibition of cytokine receptor signaling mediated by P23458 heterodimers , but not O60674 homodimers , and continuous daily inhibition was not required to maintain efficacy . Projected efficacy could be predicted from total daily exposure irrespective of the oral dosing paradigm , with a total steady-state plasma concentration achieving 50 % of the maximal response ( Cave50 ) of ~100 nM . DB08895 potency ( ED50 ) in clinical studies was ~3.5 mg P55957 ( 90 % confidence interval : 2.3 , 5.5 ) or total Cave50 of ~40 nM , derived using Disease Activity Scores from patients with RA . The collective clinical and preclinical data indicated the importance of Cave as a driver of efficacy , rather than maximum or minimum plasma concentration ( Cmax or Cmin ) , where Cave50 values were within ~2-fold of each other .
