Expression and mutational status of treatment-relevant targets and key oncogenes in 123 malignant salivary gland tumours . BACKGROUND : Malignant tumours of the salivary glands ( MSGT ) are rare and pleomorphic entities . Patients with advanced disease may benefit from targeted therapy ; however , specific targets for optimising and personalising treatments are yet to be identified . DESIGN : Immunohistochemistry for C- P10721 , P00533 , P04626 , P15941 , phospho- P42345 , androgen/estrogens/progesterone receptors and Ki67 was carried out and evaluated in terms of progression-free and overall survival . High throughput molecular screening of key oncogenes was done in 107 patients using routine diagnostic methods and Sequenom technology . RESULTS : Several therapy leads were identified , including high levels of P04626 and androgen receptors in salivary duct carcinomas , C- P10721 in myoepithelial carcinomas and P00533 in mucoepidermoid carcinomas . Recurrent mutations involving downstream elements of the P00533 pathway were found in P01112 , notably in tumours with a myoepithelial component , and in other key oncogenes ( P01116 / P01111 /PI3KCA/ P15056 /MAP2K ) . On the other hand , < 1 % of samples had P00533 or P04626 mutations . CONCLUSION : Several tumour subtypes overexpressed targets of directed therapies suggesting potential therapy leads . Genotyping results suggest activation downstream of P00533 in 18 of the 107 samples that could be associated with low efficacy of P00533 inhibitors . Other molecules , such as PI3K/MEK or P42345 inhibitors , may have anti-tumour activity in this subgroup . The high mutation rate in P01112 highlights a novel key oncogenic event in MSGT .
