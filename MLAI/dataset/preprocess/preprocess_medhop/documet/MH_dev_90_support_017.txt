Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 )α and -γ regulate IFNγ and Q16552 production by human T cells in a sex-specific way . Women develop certain autoimmune diseases more often than men . It has been hypothesized that this may relate to the development of more robust T-helper (Th)1 responses in women . To test whether women exhibit a Th1 bias , we isolated naïve cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of healthy women and men and measured the proliferation and cytokine production by these cells in response to submaximal amounts of anti-CD3 and anti- P10747 . We observed that P01730 (+) T cells from women produced higher levels of IFNγ as well as tended to proliferate more than male P01730 (+) T cells . Intriguingly , male P01730 (+) T cells instead had a predilection toward Q16552 production . This sex dichotomy in Th cytokine production was found to be even more striking in the Swiss/Jackson Laboratory ( SJL ) mouse . Studies in mice and humans indicated that the sexual dimorphism in Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was dependent on the androgen status and the T-cell expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( Q07869 )α and PPARγ . Androgens increased PPARα and decreased PPARγ expression by human P01730 (+) T cells . PPARα siRNA-mediated knockdown had the effect of increasing IFNγ by male P01730 (+) T cells , while transfection of P01730 (+) T cells with PPARγ siRNAs increased Q16552 production uniquely by female T cells . Together , our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFNγ and Q16552 that may be driven by expressions of PPARα and PPARγ .
