Molecular characterisation of a panel of human ovarian carcinoma xenografts . In a panel of 16 human ovarian tumours transplanted in nude mice , the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and in response to drug treatment were characterised . In the 16 tumours analysed we could not detect overexpression of Erb-B2 oncogene while expression of P08183 mRNA was not detected in 11/15 samples and was low in 4/15 tumours . Only three tumours had mutations in the p53 gene exons 5-8 and one of these mutations did not result in any amino acid alteration . The levels of mRNA for cyclins A , D1 and E were heterogeneous with some tumours expressing high levels and others not expressing them at all . The same was found for the cyclin dependent kinases ( CDK ) P24941 and P11802 and for CDK inhibitors P38936 / P38936 , p27/ P46527 and p16/CDKN2 . Two genes belonging to the nucleotide excision repair , P07992 and P19447 were detectable in all the samples examined , as were the genes P16455 and P20916 , also involved in DNA repair . The data indicate a heterogeneity in the expression of genes considered to be involved in the cellular responses to cytotoxic drug treatment and indicate the possibility of using these tumour models to test specifically molecules with a defined mechanism of action .
