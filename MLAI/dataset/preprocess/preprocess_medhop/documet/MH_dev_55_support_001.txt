Obesity and breast cancer : the roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 . Breast cancer is the most prominent cancer among females in the United States . There are a number of risk factors associated with development of breast cancer , including consumption of a high-fat diet and obesity . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is a cytokine upregulated in obesity whose expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer . As a key mediator of adipogenesis and regulator of adipokine production , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( Q07869 -γ ) is involved in P05121 expression from adipose tissue . We summarize the current knowledge linking Q07869 -γ and P05121 expression to high-fat diet and obesity in the risk of breast cancer .
