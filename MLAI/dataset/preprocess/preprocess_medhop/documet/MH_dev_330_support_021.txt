Expression of P35354 and DB01221 receptor genes at the cochlea and midbrain in salicylate-induced tinnitus . OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS : The expression of the genes for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and DB01221 receptor ( NR ) has seldom been reported in tinnitus . We hypothesized that expression of P35354 and NR was altered in the cochlea and midbrain in salicylate-induced tinnitus . STUDY DESIGN : Experimental study on mice . METHODS : We evaluated the tinnitus score and mRNA expression levels of P35354 and NR subtype 2B ( Q13224 ) in the cochlea and midbrain in response to intraperitoneal injections of salicylate for 4 days . RESULTS : At day 4 of tinnitus induction , the mean weights of the whole body and midbrain did not change greatly in both control and salicylate groups . The tinnitus score was not elevated from day 1 to day 4 in the control group , but increased day by day in the salicylate group . The mRNA expression level of P35354 decreased slightly in the salicylate group in the cochlea ( 1.1 ± 0.33 vs. 1.3 ± 0.49 , P = .0752 ) and in the midbrain ( 0.9 ± 0.10 versus 1.0 ± 0.35 , P = .0489 ) . Inversely , the expression levels of the Q13224 gene increased moderately in the salicylate group in the cochlea ( 3.7 ± 0.47 versus 2.3 ± 1.13 , P < 0.0001 ) and in the midbrain ( 1.6 ± 0.64 versus 1.0 ± 0.44 , P = .0007 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Salicylate induced tinnitus and altered the expression of the P35354 and Q13224 genes in the cochlea and midbrain of mice . These findings might contribute to further understanding of pathophysiology and therapy of tinnitus .
