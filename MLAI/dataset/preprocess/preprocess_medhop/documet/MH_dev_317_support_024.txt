Serum free thyrotropin subunit in congenital isolated thyrotropin deficiency . In two patients with congenital isolated thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) deficiency , serum DB00024 determined by a sensitive immunoradiometric assay ( IRMA ) was consistently undetectable . The basal levels of serum free P01215 subunit ( P01215 ) determined by a specific radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) were elevated in the hypothyroid state , and decreased to the undectable level during displacement therapy with thyroid hormone . The serum free P01215 significantly increased following intravenous administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone ( TRH ) . Serum free P01222 subunit ( P01222 ) was undectable . These findings suggest that DB00024 deficiency in this disease is not due to absence of thyrotroph in the pituitary gland or deficiency of P01215 , but to abnormalities of the P01222 gene .
