DNA hypomethylation , transient neonatal diabetes , and prune belly sequence in one of two identical twins . One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24 . The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect , affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia , urinary tract abnormalities , and cryptorchidism develop , has been suggested . We investigated a family , including one twin , with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence . Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes . Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic . We identified no mutations in Q9NU63 , Q14654 , Q09428 , GCK , P20823 , P35680 , Q9Y261 , P52945 , O43316 , or O60481 . The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci P11717 , O95661 , and Q5EB52 , while the other family members , including the healthy monozygotic twin , had normal findings . The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome , which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence .
