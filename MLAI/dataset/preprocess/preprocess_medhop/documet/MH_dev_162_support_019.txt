Reduced P25874 -1 content in in vitro differentiated beige/brite adipocytes derived from preadipocytes of human subcutaneous white adipose tissues in obesity . INTRODUCTION : Brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) is a potential therapeutic target to reverse obesity . The purpose of this study was to determine whether primary precursor cells isolated from human adult subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( WAT ) can be induced to differentiate in-vitro into adipocytes that express key markers of brown or beige adipose , and whether the expression level of such markers differs between lean and obese young adult males . METHODS : Adipogenic precursor cells were isolated from lean and obese individuals from subcutaneous abdominal WAT biopsies . Cells were grown to confluence , differentiated for 2.5 weeks then harvested for measurement of gene expression and P25874 protein . RESULTS : There was no difference between groups with respect to differentiation into adipocytes , as indicated by oil red-O staining , rates of lipolysis , and expression of adipogenic genes ( P15090 , P37231 ) . WAT genes ( P31274 , P06400 ) were expressed equally in the two groups . Post differentiation , the beige adipose specific genes Q99966 and Q07011 were significantly increased in both groups , but classic Q14032 markers Q15915 and Q68G74 decreased significantly . Cell lines from both groups also equally increased post-differentiation expression of the thermogenic-responsive gene Q9UBK2 ( P20142 -1Î± ) . P25874 gene expression was undetectable prior to differentiation , however after differentiation both gene expression and protein content were increased in both groups and were significantly greater in cultures from lean compared with obese individuals ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : Human subcutaneous WAT cells can be induced to attain Q14032 characteristics , but this capacity is reduced in WAT cells from obese individuals .
