17 DB00783 overcomes a P55008 block induced by P04035 inhibitors and fosters cell cycle progression without inducing P27361 and -2 Q96HU1 kinases activation . P04035 inhibitors , such as DB00227 and Simvastatin , cause cell cycle arrest by interfering with the mitogenic activity of mitogens present in culture media . Cells are induced to pause in P55008 and can readily resume growth upon removal of the enzymatic block . DB00286 , acting via their nuclear receptor , are mitogens for different normal and transformed cell types , where they foster cell cycle progression and cell division . In estrogen-responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells , but not in non responsive cells , 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) induces cells arrested with DB00227 or Simvastatin to proliferate in the presence of inhibitor , without restoring P04035 activity or affecting the protein prenylation pattern . Mitogenic stimulation of P55008 -arrested MCF-7 cells with E2 includes primary transcriptional activation of c-fos , accompanied by transient binding in vivo of the estrogen receptor and/or other factors to the ERE and the estrogen-responsive DNA region of this proto-oncogene , as detected by dimethylsulphate genomic footprinting analysis . Mitogenic stimulation of growth-arrested MCF-7 cells by E2 occurs , under these conditions , without evident activation of P27361 and -2 kinases , and thus independently from the mitogen-responsive signal transduction pathways that converge on these enzymes .
