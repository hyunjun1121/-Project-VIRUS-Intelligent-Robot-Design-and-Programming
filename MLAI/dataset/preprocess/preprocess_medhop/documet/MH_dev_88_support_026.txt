Insights from growth hormone receptor blockade . DB00082 is a genetically manipulated growth hormone ( GH ) that disables signal transduction through the P10912 and thus functions as a P10912 antagonist . In a series of studies of the metabolic effects of GH in healthy male individuals , pegvisomant has been used to create a model of acute GH deficiency but without the typical alterations in body composition . This review summarizes studies of the effects of P10912 blockade and fasting , either alone or in combination , on determinants of GH release . Based on these and other data we present a model to explain the somatotroph hyperactivity of fasting
