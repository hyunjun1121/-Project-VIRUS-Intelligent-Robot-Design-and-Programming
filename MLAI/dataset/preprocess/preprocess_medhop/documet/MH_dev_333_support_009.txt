Ras-dependent P29323 activation by the human G(s)-coupled serotonin receptors Q13639 (b) and P34969 (a) . Receptor tyrosine kinases activate mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases through Ras , P04049 , and MEK . Receptor tyrosine kinases can be transactivated by G protein-coupled receptors coupling to G(i) and G(q) . The human G protein-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT(4(b)) and 5-HT(7(a)) couple to G(s) and elevate intracellular DB02527 . Certain G(s)-coupled receptors have been shown to activate Q96HU1 kinases through a protein kinase A- and Rap1-dependent pathway . We report the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) 1 and 2 ( Q8TCB0 and Q8NFH3 Q96HU1 kinase ) through the human serotonin receptors 5-HT(4(b)) and 5-HT(7(a)) in COS-7 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells . In transfected HEK293 cells , 5-HT-induced activation of P27361 /2 is sensitive to H89 , which indicates a role for protein kinase A . The observed activation of P27361 /2 does not require transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors . Furthermore , 5-HT induced activation of both Ras and Rap1 . Whereas the presence of P47736 did not influence the 5-HT-mediated activation of P27361 /2 , the activation of P27361 /2 was abolished in the presence of dominant negative Ras ( RasN17 ) . P27361 /2 activation was reduced in the presence of " dominant negative " Raf1 ( RafS621A ) and slightly reduced by dominant negative B-Raf , indicating the involvement of one or more Raf isoforms . These findings suggest that activation of P27361 /2 through the human G(s)-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT(4(b)) and 5-HT(7(a)) in HEK293 cells is dependent on Ras , but independent of Rap1 .
