Con A-propagated , auto-reactive T cell clones that secrete factors promoting high IgA responses . Four BALB/c T cell clones from among a set propagated in the presence of concanavalin A ( Con A ) were selected on the basis of their ability to produce supernatant factors promoting high IgA plaque-forming cell ( P27918 ) responses by 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-conjugated DB05299 ( TNP-KLH ) -primed splenic B cells in the presence of TNP-SRBC . Such clones could be derived from cultures containing T cells not only from gut-associated lymphoid tissue , but also from the spleen . The selected clones all proliferated well in the presence of syngeneic , irradiated P25054 without either Con A or exogenous P60568 , but required both P25054 and Con A to produce helper factors . Factors from three of the clones helped B cells both to proliferate and to differentiate into IgM , IgG and IgA P27918 . Factors from the fourth clone helped B cells differentiate into IgA and IgG P27918 and may have promoted switching to these isotypes but did not support either B cell proliferation or generation of IgM P27918 . Cross-linking of B cell receptors for antigen was not required for the response to the helper factors since TNP-SRBC were unnecessary and high concentrations of them were actually inhibitory .
