DB08860 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 . We recently reported that lysophosphatidylcholine ( lysoPC ) acts on vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) to produce a mitogenic response through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . In this study , we examined the role of P04035 inhibitors on lysoPC-induced VSMC proliferation . DB08860 , a new P04035 inhibitor , suppressed lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis in primary cultured rat VSMCs . Since lysoPC-induced P27361 /2 activation contributes to smooth muscle cell proliferation , we explored the effect of pitavastatin on P27361 /2 activation . DB08860 inhibited lysoPC-induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation and P27361 /2 activation . The other P04035 inhibitors , atrovastatin and fluvastatin , also inhibited lysoPC-induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation . DB08860 also inhibited lysoPC-induced c-fos mRNA expression . To gain insight into the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of pitavastatin on P27361 /2 activation by lysoPC , we examined the role of the mevalonate pathways . Mevalonate and farnesylpyrophosphate reduced the inhibition of P27361 /2 phosphorylation by pitavastatin . These studies demonstrate that pitavastatin may inhibit lysoPC-induced VSMC proliferation , at least in part , by inactivating P27361 /2 , which is linked to mevalonate metabolism .
