Prostanoid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a novel assay for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Prostanoids are a large family of lipid mediators originating from prostaglandin H synthase ( PGHS ) activity on the 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DB00154 ) , arachidonic acid ( AA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid . The two mouse PGHS isoforms , P23219 and P35354 , were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( yeast ) , as was a signal-peptide-deleted version of P23219 ( PGHS-1MA ) . P23219 showed high activity with both AA and DB00154 as substrate , whereas P35354 activity was high with DB00154 but low with AA . Signal peptide removal reduced the activity of PGHS-1MA by > 50 % relative to P23219 , but the residual activity indicated that correct targeting to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum may not be necessary for enzyme function . Coexpression of P23219 with cDNAs encoding mouse prostaglandin I synthase and thromboxane A synthase , and with Trypanosoma brucei genomic DNA encoding prostaglandin F synthase in AA-supplemented yeast cultures resulted in production of the corresponding prostanoids , prostaglandin I(2) , thromboxane A(2) and prostaglandin F(2alpha) . The inhibitory effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) on prostanoid production were tested on yeast cells expressing P23219 in AA-supplemented culture . Dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin H(2) production by aspirin , ibuprofen and indomethacin demonstrated the potential utility of this simple expression system in screening for novel NSAIDs .
