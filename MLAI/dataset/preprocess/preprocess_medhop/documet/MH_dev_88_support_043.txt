P01308 reverses growth hormone-induced homologous desensitization . Growth hormone ( GH ) is secreted in a pulsatile pattern to promote body growth and metabolism . GH exerts its function by activating several signaling pathways , including O60674 / P35610 and MEK/ P29323 . P27361 /2 activation by GH plays important roles in gene expression , cell proliferation , and growth . We previously reported that in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells after an initial GH exposure , a second GH exposure induces P42229 phosphorylation but not P27361 /2 phosphorylation ( Ji , S. , Frank , S. J. , and Messina , J. L. ( 2002 ) J. Biol. Chem. 277 , 28384-28393 ) . In this study the mechanisms underlying GH-induced homologous desensitization were investigated . A second GH exposure activated the signaling intermediates upstream of MEK/ P29323 , including O60674 , Ras , and P04049 . This correlated with recovery of P10912 levels , but was insufficient for GH-induced phosphorylation of Q02750 /2 and P27361 /2 . P01308 restored the ability of a second GH exposure to induce phosphorylation of Q02750 /2 and P27361 /2 without altering P10912 levels or GH-induced phosphorylation/activation of O60674 and P04049 . GH and insulin synergized in promoting cell proliferation . Further investigation suggested that insulin increased the amount of MEK bound to Q8IVT5 ( kinase suppressor of Ras ) and restored GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Q8IVT5 . Previous GH exposure also induced desensitization of P42224 and P40763 phosphorylation , but this desensitization was not reversed by insulin . Thus , insulin-regulated resensitization of GH signaling may be necessary to reset the complete response to GH after a normal , physiologic pulse of GH .
