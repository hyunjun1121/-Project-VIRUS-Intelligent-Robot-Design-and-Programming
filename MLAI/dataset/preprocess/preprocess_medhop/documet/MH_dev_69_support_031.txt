Dopamine receptor agonists reverse behavioral abnormalities of alpha-synuclein transgenic mouse , a new model of Parkinson 's disease . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is characterized by loss of nigral dopaminergic ( DAergic ) neurons and presence of Lewy bodies , whose major component is alpha-synuclein . We had previously generated transgenic mice termed Syn130m that express truncated human alpha-synuclein ( amino acid residues 1-130 ) in DAergic neurons . Syn130m mice showed significant loss of DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . Subsequently , the striatal DA level and spontaneous locomotor activity of the mice were decreased significantly . In the present study , we investigated behavioral responses of Syn130m mice to DB01235 and DA receptor agonists . Administration of DB01235 dose dependently ameliorated the reduction of spontaneous locomotor activity of Syn130m mice . Similarly , D(2) agonists , quinpirole and talipexole , and a D1/D2 agonist , pergolide , were effective against the reduction . Syn130m mice also showed significant reduction in exploratory behavior compared with non-Tg littermates when they were placed in a novel environment , but this abnormality was ameliorated by treatment with pergolide . These results strongly suggest that the behavioral abnormalities of Syn130m mice were caused by low striatal DA content . On the other hand , the expression of postsynaptic D(2)-like receptors ( P14416 ) in the striatum was not increased in Syn130m mice , although the low striatal DA level is known to induce compensatory expression of P14416 . Because the abnormalities could be rectified by treatment with DA receptor agonists , it is likely that Syn130m mice provide a useful tool to explore therapeutic possibilities for PD as a new animal model of the disease .
