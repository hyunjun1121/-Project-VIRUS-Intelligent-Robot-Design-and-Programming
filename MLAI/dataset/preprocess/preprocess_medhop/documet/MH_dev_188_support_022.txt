DB03128 and muscarinic receptor function in cerebral cortex of diabetic young and old male Wistar rats and the role of muscarinic receptors in calcium release from pancreatic islets . We investigated acetylcholine esterase ( P22303 ) activity , acetylcholine and muscarinic M1 , M3 receptors kinetics in the cerebral cortex of young and old streptozotocin induced and insulin treated diabetic rats . The role of muscarinic receptors in intracellular calcium release from pancreatic islets was studied in vitro . Wistar rats of 7 and 90-weeks old were used . All studies were done in cerebral cortex . P22303 assay was done by spectrophotometric method . Radioreceptor binding assays were done for DB03128 , Muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors using specific ligands . DB01373 imaging was done using fluo4-AM in pancreatic cells . Ninety-weeks old control rats showed significantly decreased Vmax and increased Km for P22303 compared to 7-weeks old control rats . An increased Vmax observed in both 7 and 90-weeks old diabetic groups with significant decrease in Km . Scatchard analysis using specific agonists showed significant decrease in the B ( max ) and K ( d ) of acetylcholine and muscarinic M1 receptors in 90-weeks old control rats compared to 7-weeks old control . Binding studies for M3 receptors showed no significant change compared to 7-weeks old control . DB03128 , muscarinic M1 and M3 receptor number significantly increased in 90-weeks old diabetic rat groups compared to their respective controls . P01308 treatment significantly reversed the binding parameters to near control compared to diabetic group . In vitro studies showed that acetylcholine through muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors ' stimulated calcium release from the pancreatic islets . Thus our studies suggest that P01308 signaling play an important part in differentially regulating pancreatic cholinergic activity , and the diabetes mediated cortical dysfunctions with age .
