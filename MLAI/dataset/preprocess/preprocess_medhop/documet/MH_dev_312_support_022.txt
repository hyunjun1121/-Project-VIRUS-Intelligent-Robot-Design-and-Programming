Ligand-induced transrepression by P11473 through association of Q9UIG0 with acetylated histones . We have previously shown that the novel DB00171 -dependent chromatin-remodeling complex WINAC is required for the ligand-bound vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) -mediated transrepression of the DB00146 1alpha-hydroxylase ( 1alpha(OH)ase ) gene . However , the molecular basis for P11473 promoter association , which does not involve its binding to specific DNA sequences , remains unclear . To address this issue , we investigated the function of Q9UIG0 in terms of the association between WINAC and chromatin for ligand-induced transrepression by P11473 . Results of in vitro experiments using chromatin templates showed that the association of unliganded P11473 with the promoter required physical interactions between Q9UIG0 and both P11473 and acetylated histones prior to P11473 association with chromatin . The acetylated histone-interacting region of Q9UIG0 was mapped to the bromodomain , and a Q9UIG0 mutant lacking the bromodomain served as a dominant-negative mutant in terms of ligand-induced transrepression of the 1alpha(OH)ase gene . Thus , our findings indicate that WINAC associates with chromatin through a physical interaction between the Q9UIG0 bromodomain and acetylated his tones , which appears to be indispensable for P11473 /promoter association for ligand-induced transrepression of 1alpha(OH)ase gene expression .
