Identification and characterization of nucleolin as a COUP-TFII coactivator of retinoic acid receptor β transcription in breast cancer cells . INTRODUCTION : The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII plays an undefined role in breast cancer . Previously we reported lower COUP-TFII expression in tamoxifen/endocrine-resistant versus sensitive breast cancer cell lines . The identification of COUP-TFII-interacting proteins will help to elucidate its mechanism of action as a transcriptional regulator in breast cancer . RESULTS : FLAG-affinity purification and multidimensional protein identification technology ( MudPIT ) identified nucleolin among the proteins interacting with COUP-TFII in MCF-7 tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer cells . Interaction of COUP-TFII and nucleolin was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells . In vitro studies revealed that COUP-TFII interacts with the C-terminal arginine-glycine repeat ( RGG ) domain of nucleolin . Functional interaction between COUP-TFII and nucleolin was indicated by studies showing that siRNA knockdown of nucleolin and an oligonucleotide aptamer that targets nucleolin , DB04998 , inhibited endogenous COUP-TFII-stimulated RARB2 expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells . Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed COUP-TFII occupancy of the RARB2 promoter was increased by all-trans retinoic acid ( atRA ) . RARβ2 regulated gene RRIG1 was increased by atRA and COUP-TFII transfection and inhibited by siCOUP-TFII . Immunohistochemical staining of breast tumor microarrays showed nuclear COUP-TFII and nucleolin staining was correlated in invasive ductal carcinomas . COUP-TFII staining correlated with ERα , Q15788 , Q9Y6Q9 , Pea3 , P08253 , and phospho-Src and was reduced with increased tumor grade . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate that nucleolin plays a coregulatory role in transcriptional regulation of the tumor suppressor RARB2 by COUP-TFII .
