Characterisation of the cellular and molecular responses of ovine oocytes and their supporting somatic cells to pre-ovulatory levels of LH and DB00094 during in vitro maturation . The response of Graafian follicles to pre-ovulatory surge levels of DB00094 and LH in vivo triggers the terminal differentiation of granulosa cells and oocyte maturation . In polyovular species , the LH-driven signalling uses the epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) -like ligands P15514 , O14944 and P35070 to promote oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion . This experimental series used a physiologically relevant ovine in vitro maturation ( IVM ) system to evaluate the impact of exposure to pre-ovulatory levels ( 100 ng/ml ) of LH and DB00094 on ovine cumulus cell expression of P01133 -like ligands in vitro . The serum-free sheep IVM system supported high levels ( 91.4 % ) of gonadotrophin-induced maturation of cumulus-enclosed oocytes and embryo development to the blastocyst stage ( 34.5 % ) . Results were equivalent to a serum-based IVM system ( 85.1 % IVM , 25.8 % blastocyst rate ; P > 0.05 ) but were significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) to serum-free medium without gonadotrophins ( 69.5 % IVM ; 8.0 % blastocyst rate ) . Ovine P35070 was cloned and sequenced . Gonadotrophin-induced P15514 , O14944 , P35070 and P00533 expressions were quantified in cumulus and mural granulosa cells during IVM . A rapid induction of P15514 expression was apparent in both cell types within 30 min of gonadotrophin exposure in vitro . P22888 ( LHR ) was detected in mural cells and P23945 in both cumulus and mural granulosa cells . The data confirm the involvement of P15514 and P00533 during gonadotrophin-induced cumulus expansion , oocyte maturation and the acquisition of developmental competence by sheep oocytes matured in vitro .
