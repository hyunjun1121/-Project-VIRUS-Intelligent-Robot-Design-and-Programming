DB08870 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma . INTRODUCTION : DB08870 , a novel anti- P28908 antibody-drug conjugate , delivers a cytotoxic agent into P28908 (+) cells . P28908 expression is characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) and Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . AREAS COVERED : We reviewed data on brentuximab vedotin , focusing on ALCL and discuss pharmacology , clinical trials leading to approval and future research directions . Systemic ALCL , 3 % of adult Q9NZ71 , is characterized by large anaplastic P28908 (+) cells . The fusion protein P06748 - Q9UM73 , when present in systemic ALCL , confers better prognosis , although even Q9UM73 - patients with IPI score â‰¥ 3 are high-risk . For patients with systemic ALCL , 25 - 45 % relapse after frontline therapy , and > 50 % of patients will relapse following high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support . There has been no standard therapy for relapsed/refractory systemic ALCL . DB08870 , combines a monoclonal antibody targeted to P28908 with a microtubule disrupting agent and was recently approved for treatment of patients with systemic ALCL that is refractory or relapsed after at least one multiagent chemotherapy regimen . EXPERT OPINION : DB08870 provides targeted therapy to P28908 (+) lymphomas , including ALCL and HL , with high response rates and manageable toxicity , predominantly myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy .
