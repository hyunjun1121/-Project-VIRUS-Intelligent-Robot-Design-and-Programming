Ventilation-induced increases in P00533 ligand mRNA are not altered by intra-amniotic LPS or ureaplasma in preterm lambs . Chorioamnionitis and mechanical ventilation are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) in preterm infants . Mechanical ventilation at birth activates both inflammatory and acute phase responses . These responses can be partially modulated by previous exposure to intra-amniotic ( IA ) LPS or Ureaplasma parvum ( UP ) . P00533 ( P00533 ) ligands participate in lung development , and angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) 1 and Q9BYF1 contribute to lung inflammation . We asked whether brief mechanical ventilation at birth altered P00533 and P12821 pathways and if antenatal exposure to IA LPS or UP could modulate these effects . Ewes were exposed to IA injections of UP , LPS or saline multiple days prior to preterm delivery at 85 % gestation . Lambs were either immediately euthanized or mechanically ventilated for 2 to 3 hr . IA UP and LPS cause modest changes in the P00533 ligands amphiregulin ( P15514 ) , epiregulin ( O14944 ) , heparin binding epidermal growth factor ( HB- P01133 ) , and betacellulin ( P35070 ) mRNA expression . Mechanical ventilation greatly increased mRNA expression of P15514 , O14944 , and HB- P01133 , with no additional increases resulting from IA LPS or UP . With ventilation P15514 and O14944 mRNA localized to cells in terminal airspace . P00533 mRNA also increased with mechanical ventilation . IA UP and LPS decreased ACE1 mRNA and increased Q9BYF1 mRNA , resulting in a 4 fold change in the ACE1/ Q9BYF1 ratio . Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volumes increased both ACE1 and Q9BYF1 expression . The alterations seen in P12821 with IA exposures and P00533 pathways with mechanical ventilation may contribute to the development of BPD in preterm infants .
