P00533 inhibition in lung cancer : the evolving role of individualized therapy . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is the major cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA and worldwide . Most patients present with advanced disease , and treatment options for these patients are generally limited to platinum-based chemotherapy and a few targeted therapies . Targeted agents currently in use for NSCLC inhibit oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase pathways , such as the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) pathway . While current P00533 -targeted agents , including erlotinib and gefitinib , may result in dramatic responses , they demonstrate efficacy in only a fraction of patients , and resistance to these agents frequently develops . In order to select patients most likely to benefit from blockade of P00533 pathways , investigators have focused on identifying molecular correlates of response to anti- P00533 therapy . New strategies to minimize the risk of resistance to P00533 inhibition have been employed in the development of next-generation P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as PF00299804 and DB08916 ; these include irreversibility of target binding , inhibition of multiple P00533 family receptors , and/or simultaneous inhibition of P00533 and other oncogenic pathways .
