Cannabinoid receptors in acute and chronic complications of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is the primary cause of myocardial infarction and stroke , which occur after sudden thrombotic occlusion of an artery . A growing body of evidence suggests that cannabinoid signalling plays a fundamental role in atherosclerosis development and its clinical manifestations . Thus , CB2 receptors are protective in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion and implicated in the modulation of chemotaxis , which is crucial for the recruitment of leukocytes during inflammation . Delta-9- DB00470 ( THC ) -mediated activation has been shown to inhibit atherosclerotic plaque progression in a CB2 dependent manner . Although P21554 and CB2 expression has been reported on platelets , their involvement in thrombus formation is still controversial . While several reports suggest that P21554 receptors may have a relevant role in neuroprotection after ischaemic stroke , recent studies show the protective effects in various forms of neuroprotection are not related to P21554 stimulation , and a protective role of P21554 blockade has also been reported . In addition , vascular and myocardial P21554 receptors contribute to the modulation of blood pressure and heart rate . It is tempting to suggest that pharmacological modulation of the endocannabinoid system is a potential novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of atherosclerosis . For these purposes , it is important to better understand the complex mechanisms of endocannabinoid signalling and potential consequences of its pharmacological modulation , as it may have both pro- and anti-atherosclerotic effects .
