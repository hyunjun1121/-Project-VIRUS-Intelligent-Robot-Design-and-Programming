Stress-induced alterations in P08908 receptor transcriptional modulators O75398 and Q6P1N0 . The effect of stress on the mRNA and protein level of the P08908 receptor and two of its key transcriptional modulators , O75398 and Q6P1N0 , was examined in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) and hippocampus ( Hp ) using rodent models : olfactory bulbectomy ( OB ) and prenatal stress ( PS ) in male and female rats ; chronic mild stress in male rats ( CMS ) and pregnancy stress . In P27918 , CMS induced the most widespread changes , with significant reduction in both mRNA and protein levels of O75398 , P08908 receptor and in Q6P1N0 mRNA ; while in Hp P08908 receptor and Q6P1N0 protein levels were also decreased . In male , but not female OB rats P27918 Q6P1N0 and P08908 receptor protein levels were reduced , while in Hp P08908 receptor , Q6P1N0 and O75398 mRNA 's but not protein were reduced . In PS rats P27918 P08908 receptor protein was reduced more in females than males ; while in Hp Q6P1N0 protein was increased in females . In pregnancy stress , P27918 O75398 , Q6P1N0 and P08908 protein receptor levels were reduced , and in HP P08908 receptor protein levels were also reduced ; in HP only O75398 and Q6P1N0 mRNA levels were reduced . Overall , CMS and stress during pregnancy produced the most salient changes in P08908 receptor and transcription factor expression , suggesting a primary role for altered transcription factor expression in chronic regulation of P08908 receptor expression . By contrast , OB ( in males ) and PS ( in females ) produced gender-specific reductions in P27918 P08908 receptor protein levels , suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation . These and previous data suggest that chronic stress might be a key regulator of O75398 / Q6P1N0 gene expression .
