Expression of calcium-sensing receptor and characterization of intracellular signaling in human pituitary adenomas . Extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) has been recently identified in rat and mouse pituitary and in AtT-20 cells . The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of P41180 in the human pituitary and its signaling pathway . Normal parathyroid biopsies , autoptic normal pituitaries , and seven nonfunctioning and six GH-secreting adenomas were studied . Southern blot analysis of the RT-PCR products from pituitary adenomas indicated that the PCR fragments obtained were products of specific amplification of P41180 messenger ribonucleic acid . Sequence analysis showed nucleotide identity of these products with the available human parathyroid P41180 . By immunoblotting analysis P41180 , was detected in normal and adenomatous pituitary tissues . In all tumors studied , extracellular Ca2+ ( 2.5 mmol/L ) induced a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ , mainly due to Ca2+ mobilization ( from 82.7+/-11 to 148+/-36 nmol/L ; P < 0.001 ) . Similar results were obtained with the P41180 activators gadolinium and neomycin . Moreover , P41180 activators significantly increased DB02527 levels ; this effect was not mimicked by other agents able to increase intracellular Ca2+ , such as TRH . P41180 agonists did not increase resting GH secretion in any GH-secreting adenomas , but amplified the GH response to P01286 . In this study we first demonstrate P41180 expression in the human pituitary and provides evidence for an additional mechanism by which calcium might regulate pituitary cell function .
