Interactions between prostaglandin E2 and inhibitors of platelet aggregation which act through cyclic AMP . Prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 potentiates platelet aggregation at low concentrations ( 10(-8)-10(-6) M ) . It also inhibits aggregation at a higher concentration ( 10(-5) M ) , probably by acting through cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) . The mechanism of this biphasic effect of DB00917 and its implications for thrombosis are not clearly understood . Using a sensitive cyclic AMP assay , in conjunction with platelet aggregation studies , we have examined the interactions between DB00917 and other inhibitors of platelet aggregation which act through cyclic AMP . Low concentrations of DB00917 reversed the inhibition of platelet aggregation and increase in cyclic AMP levels induced by DB01240 , PGD2 and adenosine ( which stimulate adenylate cyclase ( AC ) through separate and specific platelet receptors ) . In contrast , low concentrations of DB00917 added to the inhibition of platelet aggregation and increase in cyclic AMP levels induced by forskolin ( which stimulates AC directly ) and AH-P 719 and DN-9693 ( which inhibit cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase ( PDE ] . These results suggest that the biphasic effect of DB00917 may be mediated by interaction with two separate platelet receptors . Low concentrations appear to potentiate aggregation by acting at a receptor which is directly coupled to an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein ( Gi ) , possibly the putative PG endoperoxide receptor . High concentrations of DB00917 appear to inhibit aggregation by acting at an additional receptor , probably the P43119 . The ease with which DB00917 reverses the effects of DB01240 , PGD2 and adenosine , but adds to the effects of AH-P 719 and DN-9693 , suggests that PDE inhibitors might offer greater potential than these AC stimulators as an anti-thrombotic strategy.
