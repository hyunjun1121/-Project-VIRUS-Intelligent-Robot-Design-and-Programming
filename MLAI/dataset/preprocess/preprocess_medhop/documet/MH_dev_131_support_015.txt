P62937 as a target of DB00515 chemosensitizers . Platinum-based chemotherapeutics are the mainstay of treatment of a range of tumors achieving high response rates but limited in the course of disease by appearance of drug resistance . Tumor cells respond with reduced uptake and increased intracellular inactivation of the drugs , as well as increased DNA repair and general resistance to chemotherapyinduced cell death . DB00515 is known to induce expression of cyclophilins , a group of proteins that have peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) and molecular chaperone activities , as stress response . P62937 ( CypA ) and other members of this family are inhibited by cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) which sensitized diverse drug-resistant tumor cell lines in vitro to cisplatin . This effect of DB00091 was attributed to metabolic changes , inhibition of DNA repair , enhancement of apoptosis , altered intracellular signal transduction or increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , although no definitive explanation was provided so far . Several clinical trials employing cisplatin/carboplatin in combination with DB00091 yielded unsatisfactory results . Since viral replication was found to be dependent on cyclophilins of the host cells , effective new inhibitors , different from DB00091 or with low or absent immunosuppressive activity , are in development or clinical trials . Sanglifehrins are more potent than DB00091 and proved to increase toxicity of cisplatin against hepatocellular cancer cells in vitro . These novel cyclophilin inhibitors may offer new opportunities to achieve reversal of resistance to platinumbased drugs in refractory patients . Responsive cancer patients may be enriched in clinical trials by an identification of the downstream targets of Cyps responsible for chemoresistance .
