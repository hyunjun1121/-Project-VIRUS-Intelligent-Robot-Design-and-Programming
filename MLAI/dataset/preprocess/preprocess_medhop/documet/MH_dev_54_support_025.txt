Endo- P07237 is required for TNFα-induced angiogenesis . Protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) and its homologs are oxidoreductases facilitating protein folding in the ER . Endo- P07237 ( also termed Q8NBS9 ) is highly expressed in endothelial cells . It belongs to the P07237 family but its physiological function is largely unknown . We studied the role of Endo- P07237 in endothelial angiogenic responses . Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( with TNFα ( 10ng/ml ) increased P27361 /2 phosphorylation . This effect was largely attenuated by Endo- P07237 siRNA , whereas JNK and p38 Q96HU1 kinase phosphorylation was Endo- P07237 independent . Similarly , TNFα-stimulated NF-κB signaling determined by IκBα degradation as well as TNFα-induced ICAM expression was unaffected by Endo- P07237 siRNA . The action of Endo- P07237 was not mediated by extracellular thiol exchange or cell surface P07237 as demonstrated by nonpermeative inhibitors and P07237 -neutralizing antibody . Moreover , exogenously added P07237 failed to restore P27361 /2 activation after Endo- P07237 knockdown . This suggests that Endo- P07237 acts intracellularly potentially by maintaining the Ras/Raf/MEK/ P29323 pathway . Indeed , knockdown of Endo- P07237 attenuated Ras activation measured by G-LISA and Raf phosphorylation . P29323 activation influences gene expression by the transcriptional factor AP-1 , which controls P14780 and cathepsin B , two proteases required for angiogenesis . TNFα-stimulated P14780 and cathepsin B induction was reduced by silencing of Endo- P07237 . Accordingly , inhibition of cathepsin B or Endo- P07237 siRNA blocked the TNFα-stimulated angiogenic response in the spheroid outgrowth assays . Moreover ex vivo tube formation and in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis in response to TNFα were attenuated by Endo- P07237 siRNA . In conclusion , our study establishes Endo- P07237 as a novel , important mediator of AP-1-driven gene expression and endothelial angiogenic function .
