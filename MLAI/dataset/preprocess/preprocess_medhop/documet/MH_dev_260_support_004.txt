Recombinant human P05155 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency ( DB05341 -HAE ) . The lack of C1 inhibitor function that results in excessive production of bradykinin causing the angioedema seen in hereditary angioedema ( HAE ) is well established . Several drugs have been developed to treat and prevent attacks in patients suffering from HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency ( DB05341 -HAE ) . Plasma-derived C1INH has been used to replace the deficiency of C1 inhibitor ( C1INH ) and has been approved for both treatment of attacks and for prophylactic therapy to prevent attacks . P03952 inhibitor ( ecallantide ) and bradykinin receptor antagonist ( icatibant ) are both effective for treatment of acute attacks , but their short half-life limits the use for prophylaxis . Androgens , in particular danazol , are effective for long-term prophylaxis , but adverse event profile can limit its use . Recombinant C1 inhibitor derived from transgenic rabbits has recently been approved for use in treatment of DB05341 -HAE attacks and is effective and appears safe with minimal adverse event profile .
