FK506 binding protein mutational analysis . Defining the surface residue contributions to stability of the calcineurin co-complex . The 12- and 13-kDa FK506 binding proteins ( P62942 and P26885 ) are cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that bind the macrolides FK506 ( DB00864 ) and rapamycin ( DB00877 ) . The P62942 .FK506 complex is immunosuppressive , acting as an inhibitor of the protein phosphatase calcineurin . We have examined the role of the key surface residues of P62942 and P26885 in calcineurin interactions by generating substitutions at these residues by site-directed mutagenesis . All mutants are active catalysts of the prolyl isomerase reaction , and bind FK506 or rapamycin with high affinity . Mutations at P62942 residues DB00128 -37 , DB00125 -42 , DB00117 -87 , and DB00167 -90 decrease calcineurin affinity of the mutant P62942 .FK506 complex by as much as 2600-fold in the case of I90K . Replacement of three P26885 surface residues ( Gln-50 , Ala-95 , and Lys-98 ) with the corresponding homologous P62942 residues ( DB00125 -42 , DB00117 -87 , and DB00167 -90 ) generates an P26885 variant that is equivalent to P62942 in its affinity for FK506 , rapamycin , and calcineurin . These results confirm the role of two loop regions of P62942 ( residues 40-44 and 84-91 ) as part of the effector face that interacts with calcineurin .
