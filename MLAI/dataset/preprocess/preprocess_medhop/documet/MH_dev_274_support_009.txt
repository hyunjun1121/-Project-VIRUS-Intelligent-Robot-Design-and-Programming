Characterization of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor heterologously produced using the baculovirus/insect cell and the Semliki Forest virus systems . 1. Two eukaryotic viral systems , the baculovirus/insect cell and the Semliki Forest virus systems , were tested for heterologous expression of human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor ( GnRHR ) cDNA . 2 . An unmodified as well as a c-myc epitope-tagged human P30968 was produced in two insect cell lines ( Spodoptera frugiperda , Trichoplusia ni ) after infection with the respective recombinant baculoviruses . In both insect cell lines , the receptor was identified by immunoblot analysis as a triplet of bands between 35 and 40 kDa . After deglycosylation of the receptor the molecular mass decreased to 35 kDa . The P30968 was localized in membrane compartments within the infected insect cells . However , only in membranes of infected Trichoplusia ni insect cells could approximately 2000 receptors per cell be detected . 3 . Production of the P30968 in BHK cells using the Semliki Forest virus system resulted in approximately 50,000 receptors per cell . A maximal yield of 0.42 pmol/mg membrane protein was obtained 24 hr after electroporation of BHK cells with in vitro synthesized RNA . Binding of the antagonist [125I] DB00050 was saturable with a KD of 1.3 nM . The receptor produced in the BHK cells was further characterized by ligand displacement studies . The rank order of agonist and antagonist affinities was DB00050 > DB06825 > Antide > DB00644 .
