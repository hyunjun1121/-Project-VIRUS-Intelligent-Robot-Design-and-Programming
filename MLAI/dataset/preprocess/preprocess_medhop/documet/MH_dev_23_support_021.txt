Multiple pathways of apolipoprotein E signaling in primary neurons . P02649 is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease , and the apoE protein is associated with beta-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer 's disease brain . We examined signaling pathways stimulated by apoE in primary neurons in culture . ApoE and an apoE-derived peptide activated several intracellular kinases , including prominently extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . P27361 /2 activation by apoE was blocked by an inhibitor of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family , the specific DB01221 glutamate receptor antagonist MK 801 and other calcium channel blockers . Activation of apoE receptors also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 , an adaptor protein of apoE receptors , but experiments in Dab1 knockout neurons demonstrated that Dab1 was not necessary for P29323 activation . In contrast , apoE treatment of primary neurons decreased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase , a kinase that interacts with another apoE receptor adaptor protein , c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein . This change also depended on interactions with the low-density lipoprotein receptor family but was independent of calcium channels . c-Jun N-terminal kinase deactivation by apoE was blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors and pertussis toxin . These results demonstrate that apoE affects several signaling cascades in neurons : increased disabled phosphorylation , activation of the P27361 /2 pathway ( dependent on calcium influx via the DB01221 receptor ) and inhibition of the P45983 /2 pathway ( dependent on gamma-secretase and G proteins ) .
