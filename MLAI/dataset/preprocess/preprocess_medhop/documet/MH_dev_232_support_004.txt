ICE/ P29466 inhibitors as novel anti-inflammatory drugs . In recent years , several strategies that selectively inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines , have yielded effective protein-based therapies for inflammatory disorders , validating the therapeutic hypothesis that intervention in cytokine signalling can provide clinical benefit . However , these protein-based products must be administered by injection , a constraint associated with inconvenience , adverse effects and expense for patients , caregivers and insurers . Besides interfering with the effects of cytokines such as P01375 or IL-1beta that have already been produced , inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production or signalling with low-molecular weight orally-active drugs would combine the convenience of conventional pharmaceuticals with the focused efficacy of the protein therapies . Reducing IL-1beta and Q14116 production by inhibition of IL-1beta converting enzyme ( ICE , caspase-1 ) is one promising strategy because of the key roles of these cytokines in many inflammatory diseases . DB04875 , the first orally available , potent and selective ICE inhibitor to enter clinical trials , is currently under investigation in rheumatoid arthritis .
