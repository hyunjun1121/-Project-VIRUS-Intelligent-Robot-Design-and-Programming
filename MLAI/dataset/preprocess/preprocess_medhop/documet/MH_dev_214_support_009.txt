DB01373 -activated , calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity in bovine thyroid cytosol . Bovine thyroid 100,000 X g supernatant contained calcium-activated , calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( PK- P62158 ) activity . The PK- P62158 was partially purified using ion-exchange chromatography and characterized . PK- P62158 , using casein as exogenous substrate , was not stimulated by Ca2+ ( 0-500 microM ) or calmodulin ( 1-10 micrograms ) by themselves , but was stimulated by the combination of the two by 100 % . The activation of the enzyme by Ca2+ and calmodulin was dose-dependent with maximal stimulation evident at 1 microM free-Ca2+ and 3 micrograms calmodulin . Both chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine inhibited the thyroid enzyme in a dose-related manner . The molecular weight ( MW ) of the PK- P62158 , based on gel filtration , was approximately 500,000 . PK- P62158 could also be demonstrated using endogenous thyroid cytosol proteins as substrate . Separation of these 32P-labelled proteins by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography revealed that one major protein of approximately 56,000 MW was phosphorylated by PK- P62158 . In some experiments , a second , less-intense protein band of approximately 64,000 MW was also phosphorylated . Evidence is presented , suggesting that these two protein bands may result from the autophosphorylation of the PK- P62158 holoenzyme . These results offer a molecular mechanism , in addition to protein kinase C , by which Ca2+ effects may be mediated in thyroid .
