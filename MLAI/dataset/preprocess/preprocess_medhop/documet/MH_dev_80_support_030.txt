New therapeutical strategies in the treatment of metastatic disease . Metastatic melanoma is a very aggressive cancer . For decades , although dacarbazine has been the standard of care as first-line therapy , new therapies have now been shown their superiority either alone or in association with dacarbazine . DB06186 ( anti- P16410 monoclonal antibody ) and vemurafenib ( P15056 V600E inhibitor ) have been recently approved by the Food and Drugs Association and European Medicine Agency for their use in metastatic melanoma patients . Other compounds targeting the Q96HU1 kinase pathway ( anti-MEK , anti- P29323 , other anti- P15056 ) are under clinical evaluation as well as molecules targeting alternate pathways . Along with the development of these targeted agents , an initial molecular characterization of each patient melanoma has become the first step to define the best therapeutic options . The recent published data shed the light on advanced melanoma management . Herein we review the latest development of these molecules and their impact on the treatment strategy .
