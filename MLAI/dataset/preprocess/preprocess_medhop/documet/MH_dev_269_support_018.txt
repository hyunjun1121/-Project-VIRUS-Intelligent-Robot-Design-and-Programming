P04629 and Q16620 receptors facilitate follicle assembly and early follicular development in the mouse ovary . Recent studies have demonstrated that neurotrophins ( NTs ) and their NTRK tyrosine kinase receptors , thought to be exclusively required for the development of the nervous system , are also involved in controlling ovarian development . Here , we show that primordial follicle formation is decreased in the absence of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) or its receptor P04629 , and in the absence of Q16620 , the receptor for neurotrophin-4 ( P34130 ) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) . This deficiency is not due to premature oocyte loss , because the ovaries of Ntrk1(-/-) and Ntrk2(-/-) mice do not show an increased rate of oocyte death antedating the initiation of folliculogenesis . Moreover , exposure of P01138 -deficient ovaries to P01138 rescues the defect in follicular assembly , if P04629 receptors are present , suggesting that the absence of NTs causes a delay , and not an irretrievable loss , of follicle formation . Both the number of secondary follicles and DB00094 receptor ( P23945 ) expression are diminished in Ntrk1- and Ntrk2-null ovaries , but not in ovaries lacking the common NT receptor P08138 . Transient exposure of wild-type ovaries to P34130 increases Fshr gene expression and enhances the ability of the ovary to respond to DB00094 with formation of cyclin D2 , a cell cycle protein mediating the proliferative actions of DB00094 in the ovary . These results indicate that both P04629 and Q16620 receptors are necessary for the timely assembly of primordial follicles and for sustaining early follicular development . They also suggest that a mechanism by which Q16620 receptors facilitate subsequent follicle development is by inducing the formation of functional P23945 .
