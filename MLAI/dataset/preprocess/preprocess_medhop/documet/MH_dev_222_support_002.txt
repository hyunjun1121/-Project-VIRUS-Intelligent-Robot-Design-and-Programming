Cell cycle actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein in non-small cell lung carcinoma . P12272 ( P12272 ) , a paraneoplastic protein expressed by two-thirds of human non-small cell lung cancers , has been reported to slow progression of lung carcinomas in mouse models and to lengthen survival of patients with lung cancer . This study investigated the effects of ectopic expression of P12272 on proliferation and cell cycle progression of two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that are normally P12272 negative . Stable transfection with P12272 decreased H1944 cell DNA synthesis , measured by thymidine incorporation , bromodeoxyuridine uptake , and MTT proliferation assay . A substantial fraction of P12272 -positive cells was arrested in or slowly progressing through P55008 . P12004 D2 and cyclin A2 protein levels were 60-70 % lower in P12272 -expressing cells compared with control cells ( P < 0.05 , N = 3 independent clones per group ) , while expression of p27(Kip1) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , was increased by 35 +/- 9 % ( mean +/- SE , P < 0.05 ) in the presence of P12272 . Expression of other cyclins , including cyclins D1 and D3 , and cyclin-dependent kinases was unaffected by P12272 . P12272 did not alter the phosphorylation state of Rb , but decreased cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 2-cyclin A2 complex formation . Ectopic expression of P12272 stimulated P29323 phosphorylation . In MV522 cells , P12272 had similar effects on DNA synthesis , cyclin A2 expression , P06400 levels , P24941 -cyclin A2 association , and P29323 activation . In summary , P12272 appears to slow progression of lung cancer cells into S phase , possibly by decreasing activation of P24941 . Slower cancer cell proliferation could contribute to slower tumor progression and increased survival of patients with P12272 -positive lung cancer .
