Effective motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation for black blood magnetic resonance imaging of the heart . PURPOSE : To investigate the effectiveness of flow signal suppression of a motion-sensitizing magnetization preparation ( MSPREP ) sequence and to optimize a 2D MSPREP steady-state free precession ( SSFP ) sequence for black blood imaging of the heart . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Using a flow phantom , the effect of varying field of speed ( P01100 ) , b-value , voxel size , and flow pattern on the flow suppression was investigated . In seven healthy volunteers , black blood images of the heart were obtained at 1.5T with MSPREP-SSFP and double inversion recovery fast spin echo ( P30518 -FSE ) techniques . Myocardium and blood signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) and myocardium-to-blood contrast-to-noise ratio ( P21554 ) were measured . The optimal P01100 that maximized the P21554 for MSPREP-SSFP was determined . RESULTS : Phantom data demonstrated that the flow suppression was induced primarily by the velocity encoding effect . In humans , P01100 =10-20 cm/s was found to maximize the P21554 for short-axis ( SA ) and four-chamber ( 4C ) views . Compared to P30518 -FSE , MSPREP-SSFP provided similar blood SNR efficiency in the SA basal and mid-views and significantly lower blood SNR efficiency in the SA apical ( P=0.02 ) and 4C ( P=0.01 ) views , indicating similar or better blood suppression . CONCLUSION : Velocity encoding is the primary flow suppression mechanism of the MSPREP sequence and 2D MSPREP-SSFP black blood imaging of the heart is feasible in healthy subjects .
