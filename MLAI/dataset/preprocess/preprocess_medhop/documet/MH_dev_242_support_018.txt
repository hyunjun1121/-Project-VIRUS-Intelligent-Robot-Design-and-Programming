Association of folate with hearing is dependent on the 5,10-methylenetetrahdyrofolate reductase 677C --> T mutation . Vascular disease and its risk factors have been associated with the age-related hearing loss . We examined the association of elevated plasma homocysteine and its determinants with hearing levels . Pure-tone air conduction thresholds in 728 individuals with sensorineural hearing loss were not associated with homocysteine , erythrocyte folate and DB00165 . Low concentrations of serum folate and DB00115 were associated with better hearing . When folate status was below the median , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( P42898 ) 677TT homozygotes had similar hearing levels to subjects with a C allele . However , when folate status was above the median , P42898 677TT homozygotes had on an average 5 dB ( p = 0.037 ) and 2.6 dB ( p = 0.021 ) lower P03951 -high and P03951 -low hearing thresholds , respectively , than the subjects with a 677C allele . The relationship between serum folate and hearing thresholds appeared to be dependent on P42898 677 genotype ( CC , r = 0.13 , p = 0.034 ; TT , r = -0.10 , p = 0.291 ) . This supports the hypothesis that a greater one-carbon moiety commitment to de novo synthesis of nucleotides and an increase in formyl-folate derivatives relative to methyl-folate derivatives is protective for hearing .
