P33261 polymorphism is associated with reduced clopidogrel response in cerebrovascular disease . PURPOSE : DB00758 is a prodrug that requires transformation into an active metabolite by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) in the liver in order to irreversibly inhibit the Q9H244 adenosine diphosphate platelet receptor . P33261 polymorphism has been reported to correlate with reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel in coronary artery disease . We assessed the association between P33261 polymorphism and clopidogrel resistance in patients with cerebrovascular disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We retrospectively gathered data from patients who experienced cerebrovascular disease , received clopidogrel , and were tested for clopidogrel resistance and P33261 polymorphism . DB00758 resistance was tested by the VerifyNow Q9H244 system , and the P33261 polymorphism was tested by the Seeplex P33261 P12821 Genotyping system . DB00758 resistance was expressed in Q9H244 reaction units ( PRU ) and percent inhibition . High PRU and low percent inhibition suggests clopidogrel resistance . P33261 polymorphisms were expressed as extensive , intermediate , and poor metabolizers . DB00758 resistance was assessed according to the subgroup of P33261 polymorphism . RESULTS : A total of 166 patients were evaluated . The PRU values of extensive P33261 metabolizers ( 195.0±84.9 ) were significantly lower than those of intermediate and poor metabolizers ( 237.9±88.0 , 302.2±58.9 ) . The percent inhibition of extensive metabolizers ( 44.6±21.8 ) was significantly higher than that of intermediate and poor metabolizers ( 30.5±21.5 , 14.0±13.4 ) . CONCLUSION : Intermediate and poor metabolizing P33261 polymorphism is associated with reduced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in patients with cerebrovascular disease . The clinical implications of this finding require further investigation .
