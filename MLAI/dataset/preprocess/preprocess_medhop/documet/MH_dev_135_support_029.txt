Dissociable fronto-striatal effects of dopamine D2 receptor stimulation on cognitive versus motor flexibility . Genetic and pharmacological studies suggest an important role of the dopamine D2 receptor ( P14416 ) in flexible behavioral adaptation , mostly shown in reward-based learning paradigms . Recent evidence from imaging genetics indicates that also intentional cognitive flexibility , associated with lateral frontal cortex , is affected by variations in P14416 signaling . In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) study , we tested the effects of a direct pharmacological manipulation of P14416 stimulation on intentional flexibility in a task-switching context , requiring switches between cognitive task rules and between response hands . In a double blind , counterbalanced design , participants received either a low dose of the P14416 agonist bromocriptine or a placebo in two separate sessions . DB01200 modulated the blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal during rule switching : rule-switching-related activity in the left posterior lateral frontal cortex and in the striatum was increased compared to placebo , at comparable performance levels . Fronto-striatal connectivity under bromocriptine was slightly increased for rule switches compared to rule repetitions . Hand-switching-related activity , in contrast , was reduced under bromocriptine in sensorimotor regions . Our results provide converging evidence for an involvement of P14416 signaling in fronto-striatal mechanisms underlying intentional flexibility , and indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying different types of flexibility ( cognitive vs motor ) are affected differently by increased dopaminergic stimulation .
