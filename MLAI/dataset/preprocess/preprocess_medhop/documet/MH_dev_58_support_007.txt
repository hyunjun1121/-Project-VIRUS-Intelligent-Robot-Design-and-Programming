Evaluation of a microarray for genotyping polymorphisms related to xenobiotic metabolism and DNA repair . We present an oligonucleotide microarray ( " MetaboChip " ) based on the arrayed primer extension ( P27695 ) technique , allowing genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in genes of interest for cancer susceptibility and pharmacogenetics . P27695 consists of a sequencing reaction primed by an oligonucleotide anchored with its 5' end to a glass slide and terminating one nucleotide before the polymorphic site . The extension with one fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide complementary to the template reveals the polymorphism . Ninety-three SNPs in 42 genes were selected among those resequenced in the context of the SNP500 project , using a set of 102 reference DNA samples from the Coriell Biorepository . Selected SNPs belong to the following genes : P00325 , P05091 , P27695 , CDKN2A , P21964 , P04798 , P05177 , Q16678 , P11509 , P33261 , P11712 , P05181 , P08684 , P14416 , P21917 , P07099 , P07992 , P18074 , Q92889 , P28715 , P30550 , O15217 , P21266 , P09211 , GSTT2 , LIG3 , Q00987 , P16455 , P05164 , NAT1 , NAT2 , P15559 , O15527 , P12004 , P06746 , Q01959 , P04179 , P04637 , P18887 , O43543 , O43542 , and O15287 . We assessed the performance of P27695 by comparing the results obtained with MetaboChip against those reported by the SNP500 . Among 88 SNPs that yielded signals , 6 showed less than 99 % of concordance , whereas 82 performed accurately , showing that P27695 is a reliable and sensitive genotyping method .
