Changes in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations following administration of the leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) /IgG1 fusion protein alefacept . DB00092 , a recombinant leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) /IgG1 fusion protein approved for the treatment of psoriasis , is reported to reduce selectively the numbers of circulating P01730 (+) CD45RO(+) and CD8(+) CD45RO(+) T cells , while sparing the naive cells . The purpose of the present study was to elucidate further the effect of alefacept on various circulating lymphocyte subsets . Sixteen patients , 12 with chronic plaque psoriasis and four with pustular psoriasis , received alefacept 7.5 mg once weekly for 12 weeks . Blood samples collected at study entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were analysed by four-colour flow cytometry . There were statistically significant reductions in the total number of conventional memory ( CD45RA(-) P26842 (+) ) and effector ( CD45RA(-) P26842 (-) or CD45RA(+) P26842 (-) ) T cells , including P01730 (+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing CD161 and CD8(+) T cells expressing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen ( DB01211 ) . Natural killer ( NK ) T cells were also reduced significantly , while no statistically significant changes were seen in NK cells and P01730 (+) CD25(high) cells . The affected subpopulations were all characterized by a high expression of P06729 . However , P01730 (+) CD25(low) , and P01730 (+) DB01211 (+) cells , which also expressed relative high levels of P06729 , were not reduced significantly . Our results suggest a heterogeneous effect of alefacept on the circulating memory T cell population , indicating that high expression of P06729 may not , by itself , be sufficient to explain the reduction in cell count for a specific subpopulation .
