Treatment of peripapillary choroidal neovascularization with intravitreal bevacizumab . PURPOSE : Peripapillary choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) is an uncommon condition and often shows a growth tendency towards the fovea during spontaneous progression that threatens visual acuity . Treatment of peripapillary CNV is difficult . The authors report results of intravitreal bevacizumab therapy for peripapillary CNV . METHODS : Four patients with CNV located in the temporal or superior peripapillary area received intravitreal bevacizumab injections . Ophthalmologic examinations including O75051 were performed at baseline and at 6-week intervals . DB00693 angiography was performed at baseline and depending on clinical and O75051 findings . The mean follow-up was 34+/-20 ( 22-69 ) weeks . RESULTS : The patients received an average of 3.5+/-3.1 ( 1-8 ) injections . In all patients fluorescein angiography showed inactivation of peripapillary CNV . No further increase in size was observed in any of the patients . The O75051 showed a decrease of intraretinal and subretinal fluid . No intraocular or systemic side effects were observed . CONCLUSIONS : In this series of patients , intravitreal bevacizumab appears to be efficacious . A progression of peripapillary CNV could be prevented in all patients and the lesion was successfully inactivated . Anti- P15692 treatment with bevacizumab represents a promising therapy option for peripapillary CNV .
