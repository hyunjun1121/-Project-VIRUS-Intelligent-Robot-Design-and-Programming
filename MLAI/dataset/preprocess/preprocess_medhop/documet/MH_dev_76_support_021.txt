Novel strategies in drug discovery of the calcium-sensing receptor based on biased signaling . A hallmark of chronic kidney disease is hyperphosphatemia due to renal phosphate retention . Prolonged parathyroid gland exposure to hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism characterized by hyperplasia of the glands and excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , which causes renal osteodystrophy . PTH secretion from the parathyroid glands is controlled by the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) that senses extracellular calcium . High extracellular calcium activates the P41180 causing inhibition of PTH secretion through multiple signaling pathways . DB01012 is the first drug targeting the P41180 and can be used to effectively control and reduce PTH secretion in PTH-related diseases . DB01012 is a positive allosteric modulator of the P41180 and affects PTH secretion from parathyroid glands by shifting the calcium-PTH concentration-response curve to the left . One major disadvantage of cinacalcet is its hypocalcemic side effect , which may be caused by increased P41180 -mediated calcitonin secretion from the thyroid gland . However , multiple studies indicate that PTH and calcitonin secretion are stimulated by different signaling pathways , and therefore it might be possible to develop a P41180 activating drug that selectively activates signaling pathways that inhibit PTH secretion while having no effect on signaling pathways involved in calcitonin secretion . Such a drug would have the same therapeutic value as cinacalcet in lowering PTH secretion while eliminating the side effect of hypocalcemia by virtue of it not affecting calcitonin secretion . The present review will focus on recent advancements in understanding signaling and biased signaling of the P41180 , and how that may be utilized to discover new and smarter drugs targeting the P41180 .
