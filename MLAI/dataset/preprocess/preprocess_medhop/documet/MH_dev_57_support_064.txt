Farnesoid X receptor agonist for the treatment of liver and metabolic disorders : focus on 6-ethyl- DB06777 . 6-ethyl-chedeoxycholic acid ( 6E- DB06777 ) is a farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) ligand endowed with agonistic activity under development for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis ( P10515 ) and liver-related metabolic disorders including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Q96RI1 is a bile sensor that acts in coordination with other nuclear receptors to regulate essential steps of bile acid uptake , metabolism and excretion . 6E- DB06777 has been investigated in preclinical models of cholestasis , liver fibrosis and diet-induced atherosclerosis . In a phase II clinical trial in patients with P10515 , 6E- DB06777 met the primary endpoint of a reduction in alkaline phosphatase levels but safety data indicated that the drug exacerbated pruritus , one of the main symptoms of P10515 , suggesting that 6E- DB06777 or Q96RI1 are mediators of pruritus in humans . Treatment of patients with diabetes and liver steatosis resulted in amelioration of insulin sensitivity despite a reduction a slight reduction in HDL and increased levels of LDL were observed . These side effects on bile acids and lipid metabolism were all predicted by pre-clinical studies , suggesting that potent Q96RI1 ligands hold promise but potential side effects might limit their development .
