[ Clinical and cytogenetic analyses of 45 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ] . OBJECTIVE : To analyze the correlation between clinical features and cytogenetic finding of 45 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , and to assess the value of chromosomal examination for the diagnosis and prognosis . METHODS : Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) was utilized for detecting the P11274 / P00519 fusion gene and P04637 gene . Median survival time ( MST ) of patients was compared using Log-rank test . RESULTS : Respectively , the MST of patients with white blood cell count ( WBC ) ≤30 × 10(9)/L , normal karyotype , or without a Philadelphia chromosome were significantly greater than those with WBC > 30 × 10(9)/L , abnormal karyotype or Philadelphia chromosome ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : WBC , karyotype abnormalities and presence of Philadelphia chromosome are independent factors for the prognosis of ALL in adult patients .
