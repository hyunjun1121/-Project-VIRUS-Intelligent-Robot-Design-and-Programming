DB08904 attenuates the pro-inflammatory state in endothelial cells in a manner that is atheroprotective . OBJECTIVES : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular death . Anti- P01375 therapy is thought to reduce clinical cardiovascular disease risk and improve vascular function in RA patients . However , the specific effects of P01375 inhibitors on endothelial cell function are largely unknown . Our aim was to explore the effects of certolizumab pegol ( CZP ) on P01375 -activated human aortic endothelial cells ( HAoECs ) . METHODS : HAoECs were cultured in vitro and exposed to i ) P01375 alone , ii ) P01375 plus CZP , or iii ) neither agent . Microarray analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to analyse gene expression . Activation of NF-κB was investigated using immunocytochemistry , high content analysis and western blotting . Flow cytometry was performed to detect microparticle release from HAoECs . RESULTS : P01375 alone had strong effects on endothelial gene expression , while P01375 and CZP together produced a global gene expression pattern similar to untreated controls . In particular , genes for P16581 , P19320 and P05362 were significantly up-regulated by P01375 treatment . Notably , the P01375 /CZP cocktail prevented the up-regulation of these genes . P01375 -induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB was abolished by treatment with CZP . In addition the increased production of endothelial microparticles in P01375 -activated HAoECs was prevented by treatment with CZP . CONCLUSIONS : We have found at cellular level , that a clinically available P01375 inhibitor , CZP i ) reduces adhesion molecule expression ; ii ) prevents P01375 -induced activation of the NF-κB pathway and iii ) prevents the production of microparticles by activated endothelial cells . This could be central to the prevention of inflammatory environments underlying these conditions .
