Farnesyl diphosphate synthase : the art of compromise between substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity . Farnesyl diphosphate ( FPP ) synthase catalyzes the consecutive head-to-tail condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate ( IPP , P01031 ) with dimethylallyl diphosphate ( DMAPP , P01031 ) and geranyl diphosphate ( GPP , Q99622 ) to give ( E,E ) -FPP ( C15 ) . The enzyme belongs to a genetically distinct family of chain elongation enzymes that install E-double bonds during each addition of a five-carbon isoprene unit . Analysis of the Q99622 and C15 products from incubations with avian P14324 reveals that small amounts of neryl diphosphate ( Z- Q99622 ) and ( Z,E ) -FPP are formed along with the E-isomers during the P01031 --> Q99622 and Q99622 --> C15 reactions . Similar results were obtained for P14324 from Escherichia coli , Artemisia tridentata ( sage brush ) , Pyrococcus furiosus , and Methanobacter thermautotrophicus and for GPP and FPP synthesized in vivo by E. coli P14324 . When ( R ) -[2-2H]IPP was a substrate for chain elongation , no deuterium was found in the chain elongation products . In contrast , the deuterium in ( S ) -[2-2H]IPP was incorporated into all of the products . Thus , the pro-R hydrogen at P06681 of IPP is lost when the E- and Z-double bond isomers are formed . The synthesis of Z-double bond isomers by P14324 during chain elongation is unexpected for a highly evolved enzyme and probably reflects a compromise between optimizing double bond stereoselectivity and the need to exclude DMAPP from the IPP binding site .
