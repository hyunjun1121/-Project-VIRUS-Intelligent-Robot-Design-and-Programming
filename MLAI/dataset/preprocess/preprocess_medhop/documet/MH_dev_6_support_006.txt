Relationship of Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) -associated herpesvirus viremia and KS disease in Zimbabwe . The relationship between Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) viremia and KS disease was investigated in 500 subjects who received treatment in Harare , Zimbabwe . Subjects were grouped by results of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 serological tests , KS diagnosis , and KS clinical stage . The plasma KSHV DNA concentration was associated with concomitant KS and HIV-1 infection ( AIDS-KS ; P < .001 ) and AIDS-KS clinical stage ( P=.01 ) . Plasma KSHV DNA levels were greater in AIDS-KS than in matched HIV-1-seronegative KS ( P=.04 ) . The plasma KSHV DNA level was not associated with age , sex , systemic symptoms , or P01730 + lymphocyte count . Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell KSHV DNA concentrations were linearly related ( r2=.44 ; P < .001 ) , and the nucleotide sequence of the P04264 gene highly variable region was identical in both compartments . These findings provide evidence that KSHV viremia is common in advanced AIDS-KS in Zimbabwe and suggest a relationship between KSHV lytic replication and untreated HIV-1 infection .
