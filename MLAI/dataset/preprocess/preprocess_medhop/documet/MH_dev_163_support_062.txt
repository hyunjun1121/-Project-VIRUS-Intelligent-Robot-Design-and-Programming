DB00136 induces capacitative calcium entry involving a Q13507 protein in skeletal muscle and osteoblastic cells . This work describes the involvement of TRPC proteins in capacitative calcium entry ( CCE ) induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3 [ DB00136 ] in chick skeletal muscle and in rat osteoblast-like cells ( ROS 17/2.8 ) and the role of the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in this non-genomic rapid response mediated by the hormone . We propose that an endogenous Q13507 protein mediates DB00136 modulation of CCE in these cells , which seems to implicate P11473 - Q13507 association and the participation of an INAD-like scaffold protein .
