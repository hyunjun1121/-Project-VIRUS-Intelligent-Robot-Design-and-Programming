Lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between argatroban and warfarin . The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between argatroban and warfarin was studied . In a randomized , crossover study , healthy volunteers participated in three treatment periods , each separated by a nine-day washout interval . Drug regimens consisted of a single oral 7.5-mg dose of warfarin , intravenous argatroban infused at a rate of 1.25 micrograms/kg/min for 100 hours , or both . Blood samples were collected at intervals up to 104 hours to determine clearance ( CL ) and the apparent first-order elimination rate constant ( kel ) for argatroban and the area under the concentration-versus-time curve ( AUC ) and maximum concentration ( Cmax ) for R- and S-warfarin . An interaction was defined as a > 25 % difference in the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic values between administration of one drug alone and coadministration with the other agent . Twelve adult subjects were enrolled . The mean CL and lel for argatroban administered alone differed by < 7 % from the mean values when the two drugs were coadministered . When warfarin was administered alone , the mean Cmax and AUC of R- and S-warfarin differed from the mean values when the two drugs were coadministered by < 10 % . P00734 time was prolonged comparably when argatroban was administered alone and with warfarin . No deaths or serious adverse events were reported . No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were detected between i.v. argatroban 1.25 micrograms/kg/min and a single 7.5-mg oral dose of warfarin . DB00278 was well tolerated when administered alone or with warfarin .
