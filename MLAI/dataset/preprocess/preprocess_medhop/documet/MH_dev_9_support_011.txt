Q08462 selectively couples to E prostanoid type 2 receptors , whereas adenylyl cyclase 3 is not receptor-regulated in airway smooth muscle . Adenylyl cyclases ( ACs ) are important regulators of airway smooth muscle function , because β-adrenergic receptor ( βAR ) agonists stimulate AC activity and DB02527 production . We have previously shown in a number of cell types that AC6 selectively couples to βAR and these proteins are coexpressed in lipid rafts . We overexpressed AC2 , O60266 , and AC6 in mouse bronchial smooth muscle cells ( mBSMCs ) and human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells by using recombinant adenoviruses and assessed their localization and regulation by various G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . O60266 and AC6 were expressed primarily in caveolin-rich fractions , whereas AC2 expression was excluded from these domains . AC6 expression enhanced DB02527 production in response to isoproterenol but did not increase responses to butaprost , reflecting the colocalization of AC6 with β(2)AR but not E prostanoid type 2 receptor ( EP(2)R ) in lipid raft fractions . AC2 expression enhanced butaprost-stimulated DB02527 production but had no effect on the β(2)AR-mediated response . O60266 did not couple to any GPCR tested . DB02587 -induced arborization of mBSMCs was assessed as a functional readout of DB02527 signaling . Arborization was enhanced by overexpression of AC6 and O60266 , but AC2 had no effect . GPCR-stimulated arborization mirrored the selective coupling observed for DB02527 production . With the addition of the phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) inhibitor rolipram AC2 accelerated forskolin-stimulated arborization . Thus , AC2 selectively couples to EP(2)R , but signals from this complex are limited by DB05876 activity . O60266 does not seem to couple to GPCR in either mBSMCs or P29320 -293 cells , so it probably exists in a distinct signaling domain in these cells .
