Interaction of the cholinergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as a risk factor for depression : evidence from a genetic association study . Chronic stress and related disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity is a known risk factor for depression . Besides its effects on glucocorticoids , stress also impacts the cholinergic system . Therefore , the interaction of two polymorphisms , one on the cholinergic P43681 receptor gene and one on the glucocorticoid receptor gene ( P04150 ) , on depression was investigated . In a sample of 800 healthy participants , we genotyped for the P24385 rs41423247 and the P43681 rs1044396 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed depressiveness by means of the Beck Depression Inventory . We identified a significant epistasis effect P24385 by P43681 showing that carriers of the CC genotype at the P24385 locus who were also homozygous for the T allele at the P43681 locus had the highest depression scores . This is the first evidence from molecular genetics to show that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cholinergic system -- both involved in stress reactivity -- represent a combined risk factor for depression .
