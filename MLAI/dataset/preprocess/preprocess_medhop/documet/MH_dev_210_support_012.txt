Antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel can be reduced by calcium-channel blockers . PURPOSE : DB00758 is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) system into its active thiol metabolite . P08684 is involved in the metabolism of both clopidogrel and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers ( CCBs ) . A few reports have suggested an inhibitory interaction between CCBs and clopidogrel . Accordingly , the aim of this study was to determine the effect of CCBs on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel by serial Q9H244 reaction unit ( PRU ) measurements . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We assessed changes in antiplatelet activity in patients receiving both clopidogrel and CCBs for at least 2 months prior to enrollment in the study . The antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel was measured by VerifyNow Q9H244 assay in the same patient while medicated with CCBs and at 8 weeks after discontinuation of CCBs . After discontinuation of the CCBs , angiotensin receptor blockers were newly administered to the patients or dosed up for control of blood pressure . RESULTS : Thirty patients finished this study . PRU significantly decreased after discontinuation of CCBs ( 238.1±74.1 vs. 215.0±69.3 ; p=0.001 ) . Of the 11 patients with high post-treatment platelet reactivity to clopidogrel ( PRU≥275 ) , PRU decreased in nine patients , decreasing below the cut-off value in seven of these nine patients after 8 weeks . Decrease in PRU was not related to P33261 genotype . CONCLUSION : CCBs inhibit the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel .
