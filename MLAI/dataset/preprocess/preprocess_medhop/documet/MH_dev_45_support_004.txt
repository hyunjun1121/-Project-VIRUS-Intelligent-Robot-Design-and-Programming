aChE and BuChE inhibition by rivastigmin have no effect on peripheral insulin resistance in elderly patients with Alzheimer disease . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance ( IR ) may play a role in most pathogenic processes that promote the development of Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ( LOAD ) . This study was designed to determine the interaction between inhibition of both butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) with rivastigmine and peripheral insulin resistance ( IR ) in LOAD . METHODS : Seventy-Nine consecutive elderly patients , 31 late onset AD and 48 non-demented patients were evaluated . IR was calculated with HOMA . All of the patients were evaluated through comprehensive geriatric assessments at baseline and in the 6th and 12th months . RESULTS : End of the study , compared to the baseline values , there was a significant increase in the 6th month in both MMSE and IADL scores ( t =2.200 , p = 0.036 for MMSE and t =2.724 , p= 0.011 for IADL , respectively ) . DB00989 was improved both the scores of MMSE and IADL in elderly patients with LOAD , but there was no significance or correlation between HOMA scores and cognitive status . CONCLUSION : In conclusion , inhibition of both BuChE and P22303 with rivastigmine was improved the cognition without affecting on the peripheral IR in the elderly patients with LOAD by HOMA . Due to the complexity of disease pathogenesis , it is too early to make general comments , and further longitudinal and long-term studies on this issue are needed .
