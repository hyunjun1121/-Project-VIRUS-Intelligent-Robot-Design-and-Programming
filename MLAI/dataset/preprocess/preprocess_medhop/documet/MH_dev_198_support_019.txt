C. elegans vulval development as a model system to study the cancer biology of P00533 signaling . Molecular genetic studies of C. elegans vulval development have helped to define an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway from an P01133 -like ligand through P01133 -receptor , Ras and Q96HU1 kinase to the nucleus . Further studies have identified novel positive regulators such as Q8IVT5 -1 and Q09428 -8/ Q5T124 -2 and negative regulators such as cbl/SLI-1 . The many negative regulatory proteins might serve to prevent inappropriate signaling , and thus are analogous to tumor suppressor genes .
