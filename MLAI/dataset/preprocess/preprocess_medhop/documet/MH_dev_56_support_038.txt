DB00005 : long-term clinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis . DB00005 is a dimeric fusion protein based on the p75 P01375 receptor . It binds to P01375 and blocks its biologic activity . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials , etanercept has therapeutic activity in rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis . DB00005 improves joint inflammation , physical function and slows/halts structural damage , especially when combined with methotrexate . A sustained response is observed in a substantial percentage of patients . Although some safety issues should be considered before starting etanercept treatment , in general terms , etanercept is a well tolerated drug with an acceptable safety profile . The use of any P01375 antagonist must be in agreement with the National Recommendations for Biologic Therapy , and in difficult clinical situations , a balance between risk/benefit needs to be obtained .
