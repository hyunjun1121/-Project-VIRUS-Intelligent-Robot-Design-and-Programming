Ectopic expression of human acidic fibroblast growth factor 1 in the medicinal plant , Salvia miltiorrhiza , accelerates the healing of burn wounds . BACKGROUND : Healing of burns is a complex process and very few effective treatments exist to facilitate the burn recovery process . Human acidic fibroblast growth factor 1 ( P05230 ) plays an important role in a variety of biological processes , including angiogenesis , and tissue repair . Salvia miltiorrhiza is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as an herb for the treatment of various diseases , including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases , and traumatic injuries . We present that expression of P05230 in S. miltiorrhiza significantly accelerates the healing of burn wounds . RESULTS : The human fgf-1 gene was fused with a barley Î±-amylase signal peptide DNA sequence and driven by a 35S promoter for constitutive expression in transgenic S. miltiorrhiza plants . The highest yield of recombinant P05230 obtained from leaves of transgenic S. miltiorrhiza lines was 272 ng/fresh weight . Aqueous extracts from transgenic S. miltiorrhiza exhibited P05230 activity approximately 19.2-fold greater than that of the standard P05230 . Compared to the standard P05230 or the extracts obtained from non-transgenic plants , it stimulated proliferation of Balb/c 3 DB00279 mouse fibroblast cells assessed with the standard MTT assay and promoted angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) assay . Topical application of the extract significantly accelerated the burn wound healing process . CONCLUSIONS : The product appears to retain the biological activity of both P05230 as well as the medicinal properties of the plant . The extracts from transgenic S. miltiorrhiza combines the therapeutic functions of P05230 and the medicinal plant , S. miltiorrhiza . Topical application of the product can reduce the costs associated with extraction , purification , and recovery .
