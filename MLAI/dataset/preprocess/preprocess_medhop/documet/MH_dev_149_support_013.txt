P07237 -mediated ER retention and proteasomal degradation of procollagen I in corneal endothelial cells . Procollagen I in corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) is intracellularly degraded immediately after its synthesis . In this study , we investigated the mechanism of intracellular degradation of procollagen I by determining the role of protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) retention and further determined the degradation pathway of procollagen I in CECs . When association of P07237 to monomeric proalpha chains or the trimeric procollagen I carboxyl propeptides ( PICPs ) was analyzed , immune complex precipitated with anti-PICP antibody contained more P07237 than that precipitated with antibodies to monomeric chains . PICPs were completely colocalized with P07237 . When CECs were transfected with P07237 vector , procollagen I and the recombinant P07237 were colocalized in the ER , whereas CECs transfected with P07237 minus KDEL ( the ER retrieval sequence ) vector demonstrated that the two proteins were localized in the Golgi and were subsequently secreted into the medium . DB03615 ( an inhibitor of the chaperone activity of P07237 ) blocked colocalization of P07237 and procollagen I . Cells treated with chloroquine ( lysosome inhibitor ) did not alter the subcellular localization of procollagen I , because the inhibitor failed to induce the accumulation of procollagen I at Golgi . On the other hand , procollagen I was colocalized with ubiquitin in the cytoplasm , and proteasomal inhibitors further facilitated the colocalization of the two proteins and accumulation of ubiquitinated procollagen I ladders . These results suggest that association of P07237 with procollagen I , whether monomeric or trimeric , leads to ER retention of procollagen I before intracellular degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
