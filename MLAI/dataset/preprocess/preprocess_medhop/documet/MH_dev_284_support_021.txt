[ Larval stages of Ascaris lumbricoides : hyaluronan-binding capacity ] . DB08818 has important functions in inflammatory and tissue reparation processes . Owing to the varied strategies of the parasites to evade the host 's immune response , as well as the multiple functions and physiological importance of hyaluronic acid , the aim was to study the hyaluronan binding capacity by Ascaris lumbricoides larval stages . Larval concentrates were prepared by hatching A. lumbricoides eggs . The larvae were collected by the Baermann method . The test of serum soluble P16070 detection by Agregation Inhibition was modified . All the larval concentrates presented hyaluronan binding capacity . The obtained results allow to suppose the existence of an hyaluronic acid specific receptor in A. lumbricoides . This receptor eventually might compete with the usual receptors of the host . The parasite might use this mechanism to evade the immune response .
