Suppression of P01730 + T lymphocyte activation in vitro and experimental encephalomyelitis in vivo by the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitor PIK-75 . Class IA phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinases ( P19957 -K ) are important targets in cancer therapy and are essential to immune responses , particularly through costimulation by P10747 and Q9Y6W8 . Thus , small P19957 -K inhibitors are likely candidates to immune intervention . PIK-75 is an efficient inhibitor of the P19957 -K P42336 catalytic subunits that suppresses tumor growth , and its effects on immune and autoimmune responses should be studied . Here , we describe the effect of PIK-75 on different immune parameters in vitro and in vivo . PIK-75 at concentrations commonly used in vitro ( & #8805;0.1 & #956;M ) inhibited T and B cell activation by Concanavalin A and LPS , respectively , and survival of non-stimulated spleen cells . In naive P01730 + T lymphocytes , PIK-75 induced apoptosis of resting or activated cells that was prevented by caspase inhibitors . At low nanomolar concentrations ( & #8804;10 nM ) , PIK-75 inhibited naive P01730 + T cell proliferation , and P60568 and P01579 production induced by anti-CD3 plus anti- P10747 . In activated P01730 + T blasts costimulated by Q9Y6W8 , PIK-75 ( less than 10 nM ) inhibited P01579 , Q16552 , or Q9HBE4 secretion . Furthermore , PIK-75 ( 20 mg/kg p.o. ) suppressed clinical symptoms in ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) and inhibited Q16653 -specific responses in vitro . Thus , PIK-75 is an efficient suppressor of EAE , modulating lymphocyte function and survival .
