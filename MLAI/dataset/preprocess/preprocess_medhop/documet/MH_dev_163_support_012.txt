DB00136 inhibits transcriptional potential of nuclear factor kappa B in breast cancer cells . 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( VD(3) ) , the biologically active form of vitamin D , may have either pro- or anti-inflammatory activities because of its diverse actions on nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) . Previous studies indicated that VD(3) can either activate or inhibit NF-kappaB via Akt-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation and increase in I kappaB alpha synthesis respectively . At present , the relevant contribution of each mechanism has not been fully explored . We observed a VD(3)-mediated NF-kappaB inhibitory effect in vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) -positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells . We showed that VD(3) induced P11473 -dependent I kappaB alpha expression but still able to lead on transient NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation through Akt-induced I kappaB alpha phosphorylation . Upon TNFalpha stimulation , VD(3) was not capable to inhibit I kappaB alpha degradation , p65 nuclear translocation and p65/p50-DNA binding . Here , we found that VD(3) strongly repressed p65 transactivation in MCF-7 cells using Gal4-p65 chimeras system . P11473 was required for the VD(3)-mediated transrepression and mutations in P11473 affected its suppressive ability . We also demonstrated that neither inhibition of p65 phosphorylation nor acetylation was responsible for the transrepression . In fact , we found that treatment of MCF-7 cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors abrogated VD(3)-induced p65 transrepression . In addition , knockdown of two nuclear corepressors O15379 and Q9Y618 relieved p65 transactivation and particular TNFalpha-triggered gene expression . In conclusion , the reduction of gene activation by VD(3) in breast cancer cells was caused by the interference of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB p65 subunit . Our studies provide a scientific background for rational use of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases .
