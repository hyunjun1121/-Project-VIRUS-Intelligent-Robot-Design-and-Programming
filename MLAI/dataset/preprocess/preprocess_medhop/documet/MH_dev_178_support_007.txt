Clinical and genetic factors associated with nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving opioids . BACKGROUND : This study investigates whether demographical , disease-related and genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among patients receiving opioids for cancer pain . METHODS : Cancer patients receiving opioids were included from 17 centres in 11 European countries . Intensities of nausea and vomiting were reported by 1579 patients on four-point categorical scales . In stratified regression models including demographical and disease-related factors as covariates , 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 16 candidate genes related to opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways ( P08183 , P35372 , P41145 , P32121 , P42226 , P21964 , P20309 , P08912 , P35367 , P14416 , P35462 , P25103 , P46098 , O95264 , Q8WXA8 , P21554 ) were analysed for association with nausea and vomiting . FINDINGS : Age , body mass index , Karnofsky Performance Status , gender , use of antiemetics , type of opioid , type of cancer and eight SNPs were associated with the inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients treated with opioids ( p < 0.01 ) . The SNPs were rs1176744 , rs3782025 and rs1672717 in O95264 ; rs165722 , rs4680 and rs4633 in P21964 ; rs10802789 and rs685550 in P20309 . Only the SNP rs1672717 in O95264 passed the Benjamini-Hochberg criterion for a 10 % false discovery rate . INTERPRETATION : Clinical characteristics and SNPs within the O95264 , P21964 and P20309 genes may be associated with the variability in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients receiving opioids . This knowledge may help to identify patients at particular risk for nausea and vomiting during treatment with opioids for cancer pain .
