Coactivators for the orphan nuclear receptor RORalpha . A mutation in the nuclear orphan receptor RORalpha results in a severe impairment of cerebellar development by unknown mechanisms . We have shown previously that RORalpha contains a strong constitutive activation domain in its C terminus . We therefore searched for mammalian RORalpha coactivators using the minimal activation domain as bait in a two-hybrid screen . Several known and putative coactivators were isolated , including glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 ( Q9Y3R0 ) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -binding protein ( PBP/ Q15648 / Q15648 ) . These interactions were confirmed in vitro and require the intact activation domain of RORalpha although different requirements for interaction with Q9Y3R0 and PBP were detected . Even in the absence of exogenous ligand , RORalpha interacts with a complex or complexes of endogenous proteins , similar to those that bind to ligand-occupied thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors . Both PBP and Q9Y3R0 were shown to be present in these complexes . Thus we have identified several potential RORalpha coactivators that , in contrast to the interactions with hormone receptors , interact with RORalpha in yeast , in bacterial extracts , and in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro in the absence of exogenous ligand . Q9Y3R0 functioned as a coactivator for the RORalpha both in yeast and in mammalian cells . Thus , Q9Y3R0 is the first proven coactivator for RORalpha .
