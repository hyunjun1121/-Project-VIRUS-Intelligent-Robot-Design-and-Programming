DB00820 , a further innovation in the treatment of sexual dysfunction . In recognition of the large number of sufferers of sexual dysfunction worldwide , and the variety of etiologies of the condition , investigation into effective pharmacological agents has been expanded . One method of intervention is inhibition of the phosphodiesterase type 5 ( O76074 ) enzyme , which has already been exploited with a considerable degree -- though not complete -- success . A number of new agents that inhibit O76074 are under development . Notable among these is tadalafil , which has demonstrated a high level of selectivity for O76074 over the other phosphodiesterases and has shown efficacy in improving erectile function and sexual satisfaction in phase III trials . Throughout the clinical development program for tadalafil , the drug has been well tolerated and without serious side effects . The manufacturer , Lilly Q9Y6W8 , received an approvable letter from the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the drug as a treatment for erectile dysfunction on April 30 , 2002 . Lilly Q9Y6W8 hopes to market tadalafil , with the trade name DB00820 , in the USA in 2003 .
