Simultaneous identification of mycobacterial isolates to the species level and determination of tuberculosis drug resistance by PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to both isoniazid ( DB00951 ) and rifampin ( Q9HBH0 ) is spreading . It has become a public health problem in part because the standard culture methods used to determine the appropriate treatment regimen for patients often take months following the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis . Furthermore , the misidentification of nontuberculosis mycobacteria ( Q9P121 ) in patients presumably suffering from tuberculosis results in additional human and health care costs . The mechanisms of resistance for several drugs used to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis are well understood and therefore should be amenable to determination by rapid molecular methods . We describe here the use of PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( PCR/ P19957 -MS ) in an assay that simultaneously determines DB00951 and Q9HBH0 resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and identifies and determines the species of NTMs . The assay panel included 16 primer pairs in eight multiplexed reactions and was validated using a collection of 1,340 DNA samples from cultured specimens collected in the New York City area , the Republic of Georgia , and South Africa . Compared with phenotypic data , the PCR/ P19957 -MS assay had 89.3 % sensitivity and 95.8 % specificity in the determination of DB00951 resistance and 96.3 % sensitivity and 98.6 % specificity in the determination of Q9HBH0 resistance . Based on a set of 264 previously characterized liquid culture specimens , the PCR/ P19957 -MS method had 97.0 % sensitivity and 99.9 % specificity for determination of Q9P121 identity . The assay also provides information on ethambutol , fluoroquinolone , and diarylquinoline resistance and lineage-specific polymorphisms , to yield highly discriminative digital signatures potentially suitable for epidemiology tracking .
