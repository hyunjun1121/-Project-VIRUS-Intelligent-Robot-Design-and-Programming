Expression of retinoic acid receptor beta in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans . BACKGROUND : P10826 ( RAR beta ) has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in many solid human tumors . To investigate the putative role of RAR beta in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) , we examined the expression of RAR beta in DFSPs and analyzed the correlation of expression patterns between RAR beta and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 as well as clinicopathological variables . METHODS : Using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry , we evaluated nuclear RAR beta staining and cytoplasm P35354 staining in 53 DFSPs . RESULTS : 48 DFSPs ( 90.58 % ) were immunopositive for RAR beta , while 32 DFSPs ( 60.38 % ) were immunopositive for P35354 . RAR beta staining was significantly inversely correlated with P35354 staining ( p < 0.001 ; r =-0.668 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicated that RAR beta expressed in DFSPs and correlated with P35354 expression . RAR beta may be a potential therapeutic target for unresectable DFSP cases .
