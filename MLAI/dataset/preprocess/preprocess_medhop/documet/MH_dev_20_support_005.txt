Serotonin : a local regulator in the mammary gland epithelium . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) is a very simple molecule that plays key roles in complex communication mechanisms within the animal body . In the mammary glands , serotonin biosynthesis and secretion are induced in response to dilation of the alveolar spaces . Since its discovery several years ago , mammary 5-HT has been demonstrated to perform two homeostatic functions . First , serotonin regulates lactation and initiates the transition into the earliest phases of involution . Second , serotonin is a local signal that induces parathyroid hormone-related peptide ( P12272 ) , which allows the mammary gland to drive the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton . These processes use different receptor types , P34969 and 5-HT2 , respectively . In this review , we provide synthetic perspectives on the fundamental processes of lactation homeostasis and the adaptation of calcium homeostasis for lactation . We analyze the role of the intrinsic serotonin system in the physiological regulation of the mammary glands . We also consider the importance of the mammary serotonin system in pathologies and therapies associated with lactation and breast cancer .
