Safety profile of maraviroc in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis B or C included in the maraviroc expanded access program . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the safety of maraviroc with other antiretrovirals in patients with HIV-1 coinfected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) or hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . METHODS : This was a multicenter , noncomparative , open-label , expanded access program ( EAP ) initiated in February 2007 . Patients with P51681 -tropic HIV-1 and HIV-1 RNA â‰¥ 1000 copies/mL on their current treatment received maraviroc 300 mg ( 150 mg with protease inhibitors ) twice daily with optimized background therapy ( OBT ) , which could include the newer agents raltegravir , etravirine , and darunavir . The adverse event ( AE ) profile was compared with the active and placebo arms of the maraviroc phase III clinical trials MOTIVATE 1 and 2 , where the OBT did not include these agents . RESULTS : A total of 1,032 patients were enrolled : 51 HIV/HBV coinfected ; 149 HIV/HCV coinfected , 9 HIV/HBV/HCV coinfected , and 823 HIV-1 monoinfected . Most ( 76 % ) received at least 1 newer agent . Overall AE frequency was comparable across coinfection groups ( 63 % -72 % ) . Hepatobiliary events were more common in HIV/HCV coinfection than in HIV monoinfection or HIV/HBV coinfection ( 10.0 , 4.8 , and 3.1 per 100 patient-years , respectively ) . Across all coinfection groups , there was a trend toward lower exposure-adjusted rates of serious and hepatobiliary AEs in the EAP than in the MOTIVATE studies . Grade 3/4 transaminase elevations in patients receiving maraviroc in the EAP and MOTIVATE were comparable with those seen in the MOTIVATE placebo arm . CONCLUSION : DB04835 plus an OBT did not increase the incidence of AEs or severe laboratory liver abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients coinfected with HBV or HCV .
