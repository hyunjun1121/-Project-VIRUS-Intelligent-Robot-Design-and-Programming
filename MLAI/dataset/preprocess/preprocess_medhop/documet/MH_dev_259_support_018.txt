[ Potentiation of the photocytotoxic effect of photofrin II : synergistic action of verapamil and lovastatin ] . DB00707 ( P2 ) is at the present time the most used drug in the photochemotherapy of tumors . As previous studies from our group have demonstrated that P2 is taken up by cells mainly via the low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor pathway , we tried to increase the amount of drug delivered to cells by enhancing the P01130 expression . For this purpose , we used hydroxy methyl glutaryl DB01992 ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin . In the present work , we show that the calcium antagonist verapamil , which is currently used in human chemotherapy to overcome multidrug resistance , enhances in a synergistic manner the potentiating action of lovastatin on the photocytotoxic effect of P2 .
