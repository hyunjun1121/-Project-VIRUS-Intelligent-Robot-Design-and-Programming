The effects of pharmacologic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inhibition in acute and chronic rejection in murine cardiac allografts . BACKGROUND : Acute rejection and graft arterial disease ( Q99259 ) in cardiac transplantation limit the long-term survival of recipients ; these processes are enhanced by inflammation and thrombus formation . P00747 activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 is critical in the inflammation and thrombus formation . However , little is known about the effect of P05121 in heart transplantation . Thus , the objective was to clarify the role of P05121 in the progression of cardiac rejection . METHODS : Murine hearts were heterotopically transplanted using major mismatch combinations for evaluation of acute rejection and class II mismatch combinations for the Q99259 . We administered the specific P05121 inhibitor ( IMD-1622 ) into murine recipients after cardiac allografts . RESULTS : Nontreated allografts of the major mismatch group were acutely rejected , whereas the P05121 inhibitor prolonged their survival . Although severe cell infiltration and intimal thickening with enhancement of inflammatory factors were observed in untreated allografts of class II mismatch group on day 60 , the P05121 inhibitor attenuated these changes . CONCLUSION : The P05121 inhibitor is potent for the suppression of both acute rejection and Q99259 .
