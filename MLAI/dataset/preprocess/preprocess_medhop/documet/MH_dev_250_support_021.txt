ROS-mediated autophagy induced by dysregulation of lipid metabolism plays a protective role in colorectal cancer cells treated with gambogic acid . Gambogic acid ( GA ) , the main active component of gamboge resin , has potent antitumor activity both in vivo and in vitro . However , the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear . In this study , we found that GA could initiate autophagy in colorectal cancer cells , and inhibition of the autophagy process accelerated the effect of proliferative inhibition and apoptotic cell death induced by GA , implying a protective role of autophagy . Two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics showed that GA treatment altered the expression of multiple proteins involved in redox signaling and lipid metabolism . Functional studies revealed that GA-induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism could activate P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) , resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation , followed by inhibition of Akt- P42345 signaling and autophagy initiation . Finally , results using a xenograft model suggested ROS-induced autophagy protect against the antitumor effect of GA . Taken together , these data showed new biological activities of GA against colorectal cancer underlying the protective role of ROS-induced autophagy . This study will provide valuable insights for future studies regarding the anticancer mechanisms of GA .
