The role of heat shock proteins in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis : The therapeutic potential of DB05025 . DB05025 is a hydroxylamine derivative , a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression , but only under conditions of cellular stress . DB05025 has been found to be neuroprotective in a number of neurodegenerative disease models , including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( P35858 ) , and in mutant Superoxide Dismutase 1 ( P00441 ) mice that model P35858 , DB05025 rescues motor neurons , improves neuromuscular function and extends lifespan . The therapeutic potential of DB05025 is currently under investigation in a Phase II clinical trial for P35858 patients with P00441 mutations . In this review we summarize the evidence for the neuroprotective effects of enhanced heat shock protein expression by DB05025 and other inducers of the Heat Shock Response . P35858 is a complex , multifactorial disease affecting a number of cell types and intracellular pathways . Cells and pathways affected by P35858 pathology and which may be targeted by a heat shock protein-based therapy are also discussed in this review . For example , protein aggregation is a characteristic pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases including P35858 . Enhanced heat shock protein expression not only affects protein aggregation directly , but can also lead to more effective clearance of protein aggregates via the unfolded protein response , the proteasome-ubiquitin system or by autophagy . However , compounds such as DB05025 have effects beyond targeting protein mis-handling and can also affect additional pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress . Therefore , by targeting multiple pathological mechanisms , compounds such as DB05025 may be particularly effective in the development of a disease-modifying therapy for P35858 and other neurodegenerative disorders .
