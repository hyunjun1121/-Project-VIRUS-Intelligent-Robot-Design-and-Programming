Small interfering RNA knocks down the molecular target of alendronate , farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase , in osteoclast and osteoblast cultures . P14324 ( FPPS ) , an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway , is the inhibition target of alendronate , a potent FDA-approved nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate ( N-BP ) drug , at the molecular level . DB00630 not only inhibits osteoclasts but also has been reported to positively affect osteoblasts . This study assesses the knockdown effects of siRNA targeting FPPS compared with alendronate in both osteoclast and osteoblast cultures . Primary murine bone marrow cell-induced osteoclasts and the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell line were used to assess effects of anti-FPPS siRNA compared with alendronate . Results show that both FPPS mRNA message and protein knockdown in serum-based culture is correlated with reduced osteoclast viability . FPPS siRNA is more potent than 10 μM alendronate , but less potent than 50 μM alendronate on reducing osteoclast viability . Despite FPPS knockdown , no significant changes were observed in osteoblast proliferation . FPPS knockdown promotes osteoblast differentiation significantly but not cell mineral deposition . However , compared with 50 μM alendronate dosing , FPPS siRNA does not exhibit cytotoxic effects on osteoblasts while producing significant effects on ostoblast differentiation . Both siRNA and alendronate at tested concentrations do not have significant effects on cultured osteoblast mineralization . Overall , results indicate that siRNA against FPPS could be useful for selectively inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and improving bone mass maintenance by influencing both osteoclasts and osteoblasts in distinct ways .
