LDL subfractions in acromegaly : relation to growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I . Acromegaly is associated with changes in lipoprotein metabolism and an excess in cardiovascular mortality . We have examined low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) subfraction distribution in 24 patients with active acromegaly and in controls matched for age , sex and body mass index . LDL was subfractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation . The concentration of small dense LDL-III was significantly higher in the acromegalic patients compared to the controls ( 94.2 +/- 44.9 versus 67.2 +/- 30.4 mg/dl , P < 0.05 ) and there was a concomitant reduction in the intermediate subfraction LDL-II ( 124.8 +/- 31.3 versus 149.9 +/- 30.0 mg/dl , P < 0.05 ) . Univariate analysis showed that both growth hormone ( GH ) and insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I correlated with LDL-III and inversely with LDL-II . Acromegalic patients were found to have lower hepatic lipase ( HL ) and lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) activities than controls ( HL : 13.29 +/- 6.56 versus 21.58 +/- 7.27 micromol FFA released/ml/h , P < 0.001 : P06858 : 7.22 +/- 3.04 versus 11.53 +/- 7.85 micromol FFA released/ml/h , P < 0.05 ) whereas plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) activity was significantly increased ( 8.15 +/- 1.81 versus 5.54 +/- 1.86 pmol/microl/h , P < 0.001 ) . Both GH and P05019 were significantly associated with HL , P06858 and P11597 activities . Multivariate analysis on this relatively small sample size showed that in normal subjects , triglyceride and HL activity were the major determinants of LDL-III . In contrast , GH and HDL were the main determinants in acromegaly , accounting for 32 and 24 % in the variability of LDL-III respectively . In conclusion , GH excess has a direct effect on LDL subfraction distribution .
