Cannabis-induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cell lines : the role of the cannabinoid receptors and the MAPK pathway . Delta9- DB00470 ( THC ) is the active metabolite of cannabis . THC causes cell death in vitro through the activation of complex signal transduction pathways . However , the role that the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors ( P21554 -R and CB2-R ) play in this process is less clear . We therefore investigated the role of the CB-Rs in mediating apoptosis in 3 leukemic cell lines and performed microarray and immunoblot analyses to establish further the mechanism of cell death . We developed a novel flow cytometric technique of measuring the expression of functional receptors and used combinations of selective P21554 -R and CB2-R antagonists and agonists to determine their individual roles in this process . We have shown that THC is a potent inducer of apoptosis , even at 1 x IC(50) ( inhibitory concentration 50 % ) concentrations and as early as 6 hours after exposure to the drug . These effects were seen in leukemic cell lines ( CEM , HEL-92 , and HL60 ) as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Additionally , THC did not appear to act synergistically with cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin . One of the most intriguing findings was that THC-induced cell death was preceded by significant changes in the expression of genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signal transduction pathways . Both apoptosis and gene expression changes were altered independent of p53 and the CB-Rs .
