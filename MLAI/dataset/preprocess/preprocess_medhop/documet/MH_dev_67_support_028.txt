Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate ( DB02527 ) and DB02527 responsive element-binding protein are involved in the transcriptional regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptor by DB00644 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway in Q92820 (3) cells . Stimulation of mouse P30968 promoter by a DB00644 agonist ( DB06719 ) , or by a DB02527 analogue , significantly increased reporter ( luciferase ) activity . Overexpression of P04049 , P27361 , or P28482 partially blocked DB06719 -stimulated luciferase activity . In contrast , treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) kinase inhibitor ( PD 98059 ) activated basal and DB06719 -stimulated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner . Transient transfection of the deleted DB02527 response element expression vector followed by pretreatment with PD98059 prior to DB06719 stimulation showed that the transcriptional response was decreased compared to wild-type promoter . A gel-mobility shift assay using a probe containing the DB02527 response element showed the presence of two specific protein-DNA complexes that contain one or more members of the DB02527 responsive element-binding ( CREB ) protein family . These results suggest that DB02527 and CREB participate in the DB00644 activation of P30968 promoter activity and that the MAPK cascade is involved in the negative regulation of basal and DB00644 -stimulated P30968 transcriptional activity .
