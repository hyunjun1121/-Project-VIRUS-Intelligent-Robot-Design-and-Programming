GM- P04141 priming drives bone marrow-derived macrophages to a pro-inflammatory pattern and downmodulates DB00917 in response to O60603 ligands . In response to pathogen recognition by Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) on their cell surface , macrophages release lipid mediators and cytokines that are widely distributed throughout the body and play essential roles in host responses . Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) is important for the immune response during infections to improve the clearance of microorganisms . In this study , we examined the release of mediators in response to O60603 ligands by bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) primed with GM- P04141 . We demonstrated that when stimulated with O60603 ligands , non-primed BMDMs preferentially produced PGE(2) in greater amounts than Q06643 (4) . However , GM- P04141 priming shifted the release of lipid mediators by BMDMs , resulting in a significant decrease of PGE(2) production in response to the same stimuli . The decrease of PGE(2) production from primed BMDMs was accompanied by a decrease in PGE-synthase mRNA expression and an increase in P01375 -α and nitric oxide ( NO ) production . Moreover , some GM- P04141 effects were potentiated by the addition of IFN-γ . Using a variety of O60603 ligands , we established that PGE(2) release by GM- P04141 -primed BMDMs was dependent on O60603 co-receptors ( Q15399 , Q9Y2C9 ) , P08571 , MyD88 and the nuclear translocation of NFκB but was not dependent on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( Q07869 -γ ) activation . Indeed , GM- P04141 priming enhanced O60603 , O00206 and MyD88 mRNA expression and phospho-IκBα formation . These findings demonstrate that GM- P04141 drives BMDMs to present a profile relevant to the host during infections .
