DB00315 , a new central and peripherally acting P28221 receptor agonist in the acute oral treatment of migraine : a double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-range finding study . DB00315 is a novel , centrally and peripherally , acting 5-hydroxytryptamine1D receptor agonist . We investigated the efficacy and safety of 1 , 5 , and 25 mg of oral DB00315 in the acute treatment of migraine in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group clinical trial involving 84 patients . The proportion of patients in whom the headache improved within 2 hours from moderate or severe to mild or no pain ( primary efficacy measure ) was 15 % for placebo-treated patients and 27 % ( 1 mg ) , 62 % ( 5 mg ) , and 81 % ( 25 mg ) for patients treated with DB00315 . Treatment differences compared with placebo were 12 % ( 95 % CI - 12 , 37 ; p = 0.460 ) for 1 mg DB00315 , 47 % ( CI 21 , 73 ; p < 0.005 ) for 5 mg DB00315 , and 66 % ( CI 43,89 ; p < 0.001 ) for 25 mg DB00315 . Photophobia and nausea also showed improvement after DB00315 . Adverse events were generally mild and transient in all treatment groups . There were no clinically significant changes in ECG recordings , blood pressure , or laboratory tests . Oral DB00315 ( 5 and 25 mg ) is highly effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine . The response rates and treatment differences compared with placebo in this study suggest possible superiority over existing antimigraine therapies . This needs to be confirmed in formal comparative trials .
