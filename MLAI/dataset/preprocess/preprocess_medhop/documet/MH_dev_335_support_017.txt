Genetic aspects of pancreatitis . Acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis are complex inflammatory disorders of the pancreas with unpredictable severity , complications , and clinical courses . Growing evidence for genetic risk and modifying factors , plus strong evidence that only a minority of patients with these disorders are heavy alcohol drinkers , has revolutionized our concept of these diseases . Once considered a self-inflicted injury , pancreatitis is now recognized as a complex inflammatory condition like inflammatory bowel disease . Genetic linkage and candidate gene studies have identified six pancreas-targeting factors that are associated with changes in susceptibility to acute and/or chronic pancreatitis , including cationic trypsinogen ( P07477 ) , anionic trypsinogen ( P07478 ) , serine protease inhibitor Kazal 1 ( P00995 ) , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , chymotrypsinogen C ( Q99895 ) and calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) . Patients with mutations in these genes are at increased risk of pancreatitis caused by a variety of stresses including hyperlipidemia and hypercalcemia . Multiple studies are reporting new polymorphisms , as well as complex gene x gene and gene x environmental interactions .
