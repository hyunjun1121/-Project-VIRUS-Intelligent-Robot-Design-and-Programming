P60568 regulates expression of C- O75444 in human P01730 T cells . Blockade of IL-2R with humanized anti-CD25 Abs , such as daclizumab , inhibits Th2 responses in human T cells . Recent murine studies have shown that P60568 also plays a significant role in regulating Th2 cell differentiation by activated P42229 . To explore the role of activated P42229 in the Th2 differentiation of primary human T cells , we studied the mechanisms underlying P60568 regulation of C- O75444 expression . Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that P60568 induced P42229 binding to specific sites in the C- O75444 promoter . These sites corresponded to regions enriched for markers of chromatin architectural features in both resting P01730 and differentiated Th2 cells . Unlike P05231 , P60568 induced C- O75444 expression in P01730 T cells with or without prior TCR stimulation . TCR-induced C- O75444 expression was significantly inhibited by treatment with daclizumab or a P52333 inhibitor , R333 . Furthermore , P60568 and P05231 synergistically induced C- O75444 expression in TCR-activated T cells , suggesting functional cooperation between these cytokines . Finally , both TCR-induced early P05112 mRNA expression and P05112 cytokine expression in differentiated Th2 cells were significantly inhibited by IL-2R blockade . Thus , our findings demonstrate the importance of P60568 in Th2 differentiation in human T cells and support the notion that IL-2R-directed therapies may have utility in the treatment of allergic disorders .
