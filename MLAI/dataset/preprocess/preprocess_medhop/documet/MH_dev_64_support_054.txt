Personalized medicine and pharmacogenetic biomarkers : progress in molecular oncology testing . In the field of oncology , clinical molecular diagnostics and biomarker discoveries are constantly advancing as the intricate molecular mechanisms that transform a normal cell into an aberrant state in concert with the dysregulation of alternative complementary pathways are increasingly understood . Progress in biomarker technology , coupled with the companion clinical diagnostic laboratory tests , continue to advance this field , where individualized and customized treatment appropriate for each individual patient define the standard of care . Here , we discuss the current commonly used predictive pharmacogenetic biomarkers in clinical oncology molecular testing : P15056 V600E for vemurafenib in melanoma ; Q9HC35 - Q9UM73 for crizotinib and P00533 for erlotinib and gefitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer ; P01116 against the use of cetuximab and panitumumab in colorectal cancer ; P04626 ( P04626 /neu ) for trastuzumab in breast cancer ; P11274 - P00519 for tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia ; and P29590 /RARÎ± for all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia .
