Host genetic background at P51681 chemokine receptor and vitamin D receptor loci and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 disease progression among HIV-seropositive injection drug users . The effect of polymorphisms on genes encoding the P51681 chemokine receptor and vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 disease progression was analyzed in a cohort of 185 HIV-seropositive injection drug users . Results confirmed a lack of association in patients with HIV disease between P51681 wtDelta32 heterozygosity and a slow progression to AIDS and to a P01730 cell count < 200 cells/microL . In contrast , a more rapid disease progression was associated with the P11473 -BB genotype . A higher proportion of this genotype was found in patients with < 200 P01730 cells/microL ( P=.009 ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.3-4.7 ) , as well as a faster progression both to AIDS ( 1993 CDC classification [ CDC 1993 ] ) and to a P01730 cell count < 200 cells/microL . When the analysis was restricted to patients with a P11473 -bb genetic background , patients with P51681 wtDelta32 heterozygosity were overrepresented in CDC 1993 nonprogressors ( P=.033 ; OR , 0.28 ; 95 % CI , 0.08-0.92 ) and in those with > 200 P01730 cells/microL ( P=.062 ; OR , 0.26 ; 95 % CI , 0.06-1.08 ) . Also , patients with P51681 wtDelta32 heterozygosity showed a slow progression both to AIDS CDC 1993 and to a P01730 cell count < 200 cells/microL .
