Down-regulation of c-Cbl by morphine accounts for persistent P27361 /2 signaling in delta-opioid receptor-expressing HEK293 cells . Opioids display ligand-specific differences in the time course of P27361 /2 signaling . Whereas full agonists , like etorphine , induce only transient activation of P27361 /2 , the partial agonist morphine mediates persistent stimulation of mitogenic signaling . Here we report that in stably delta-opioid receptor ( Q8IXH6 ) -expressing HEK293 ( P29320 / Q8IXH6 ) cells , the transient nature of etorphine-induced P27361 /2 signaling is due to desensitization of epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptor-mediated activation of the Ras/ P04049 / P27361 /2 cascade . Desensitization of P27361 /2 activity by etorphine is associated with down-regulation of P01133 receptors , an effect mediated by the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl . In contrast , chronic morphine treatment failed to desensitize P01133 receptors , resulting in unimpeded P27361 /2 signaling . The failure of morphine to desensitize P27361 /2 signaling is mediated by persistent activation of c-Src , which induces degradation of c-Cbl . The role of c-Src in opioid-specific P27361 /2 signaling is further demonstrated by pretreatment of the cells with Q99463 and P12755 -I as well as overexpression of a dominant negative c-Src mutant ( c-Src(dn) ) or a c-Src-resistant c-Cbl mutant ( CblY3F ) , both of which facilitate desensitization of P27361 /2 signaling by morphine . Conversely , overexpression of c-Src as well as down-regulation of c-Cbl by small interfering RNA results in persistent etorphine-induced stimulation of P27361 /2 activity . Subcellular fractionation experiments finally attributed the ability of morphine to persistently activate c-Src to its redistribution from Triton X-100-insensitive membrane rafts to Q8IXH6 and P01133 receptor containing high density membrane compartments implicated in P27361 /2 signaling . These results demonstrate that agonist-specific differences in the temporal and spatial pattern of c-Src activation determine the kinetics of Q8IXH6 -mediated regulation of P27361 /2 signaling .
