PEGylated exendin-4 , a modified P0C6A0 analog exhibits more potent cardioprotection than its unmodified parent molecule on a dose to dose basis in a murine model of myocardial infarction . A Site-specifically PEGylated exendin-4 ( denoted as PEG-Ex4 ) is an exendin-4 ( denoted as Ex4 ) analog we developed by site-specific PEGylation of exendin-4 with a high molecular weight trimeric poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( tPEG ) . It has been shown to possess prolonged half-life in vivo with similar receptor binding affinity compared to unmodified exendin-4 by our previous work . This study is sought to test whether PEG-Ex4 is suitable for treating myocardial infarction ( MI ) . In the MI model , PEG-Ex4 was administered every 3 days while equivalent amount of Ex4 was administered every 3 days or twice daily . Animal survival rate , heart function , remodeling and neoangiogenesis were evaluated and compared . Tube formation was examined in endothelial cells . In addition , Western blotting and histology were performed to determine the markers of cardiac hypertrophy and angiogenesis and to explore the possible molecular mechanism involved . PEG-Ex4 and Ex4 showed comparable binding affinity to P43220 . In MI mice , PEG-Ex4 given at 3 days interval achieved similar extent of protection as Ex4 given twice daily , while Ex4 given at 3 days interval failed to produce protection . PEG-Ex4 elevated endothelial tube formation in vitro and capillary density in the border area of MI . PEG-Ex4 increased Akt activity and P15692 production in a P43220 dependent manner in endothelial cells and antagonism of P43220 , Akt or P15692 abolished the protection of PEG-Ex4 in the MI model . PEG-Ex4 is a potent long-acting P43220 agonist for the treatment of chronic heart disease . Its protection might be attributed to enhanced angiogenesis mediated by the activation of Akt and P15692 .
