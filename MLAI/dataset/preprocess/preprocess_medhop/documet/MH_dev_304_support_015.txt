P42345 repression by 3,3'-diindolylmethane inhibits invasion and angiogenesis in platelet-derived growth factor-D-overexpressing PC3 cells . Platelet-derived growth factor-D ( Q9GZP0 ) is a newly recognized growth factor known to regulate many cellular processes , including cell proliferation , transformation , invasion , and angiogenesis . Recent studies have shown that Q9GZP0 and its cognate receptor P09619 are expressed in prostate tumor tissues , suggesting that Q9GZP0 might play an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer . However , the biological role of Q9GZP0 in tumorigenesis remains elusive . In this study , we found that Q9GZP0 -overexpressing PC3 cells ( PC3 cells stably transfected with Q9GZP0 cDNA and referred to as PC3 Q9GZP0 ) exhibited a rapid growth rate and enhanced cell invasion that was associated with the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) and reduced Akt activity . DB00877 repressed P42345 activity and concomitantly resulted in the activation of Akt , which could attenuate the therapeutic effects of P42345 inhibitors . In contrast , B-DIM ( BR-DIM from Bioresponse , Inc. ; a chemopreventive agent ) significantly inhibited both P42345 and Akt in PC3 Q9GZP0 cells , which were correlated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion . Moreover , conditioned medium from PC3 Q9GZP0 cells significantly increased the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells , which was inhibited by B-DIM treatment concomitant with reduced full-length and active form of Q9GZP0 . Our results suggest that B-DIM could serve as a novel and efficient chemopreventive and/or therapeutic agent by inactivation of both P42345 and Akt activity in Q9GZP0 -overexpressing prostate cancer .
