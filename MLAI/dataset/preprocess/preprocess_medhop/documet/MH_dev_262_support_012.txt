Nuclear receptors in pancreatic tumor cells . AIM : This review focuses on nuclear receptors expressed in pancreatic cancer . MATERIALS AND METHODS : An extensive search of articles published up to March 2013 was conducted using the MEDLINE database . The key words used were " pancreatic cancer " , " molecular receptors " and " growth factors " . A total of 112 articles referred to pancreatic cancer , molecular receptors and/or growth factors were included . RESULTS : Receptors of growth factors , such as the epithelial growth factor receptor , insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and others , such as integrin α5β1 , somatostatin receptors , the death receptor 5 , claudin , notch receptors , mesothelin receptors , follicle-stimulating hormone receptors , the P15941 receptor , the adrenomedullin receptor , the farnesoid X receptor , the transferrin receptor , sigma-2 receptors , the chemokine receptor P61073 , the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor , the ephrine A2 receptor , the P42263 receptor , the Q04912 receptor and the angiotensin II receptor O00400 are expressed in pancreatic tumor cells . These molecules are implicated in tumor growth , apoptosis , angiogenesis , metastasis etc . CONCLUSION : After identifying the molecular receptors associated with the pancreatic cancer , many more target molecules playing important roles in tumor pathophysiology and senescence-associated signal transduction in cancer cells will be identified . This may have a significant influence on diagnosis , therapy and prognosis of pancreatic cancer .
