Significant pathways detection in osteoporosis based on the bibliometric network . BACKGROUND : Osteoporosis is a significant public health issue worldwide . The underlying mechanism of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation . However , the exact pathology is still unclear , and more related genes are on demand . AIM : Here , we aim to identify the differentially expressed genes in osteoporosis patients and control . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Biblio-MetReS , a tool to reconstruct gene and protein networks from automated literature analysis , was used for identifying potential interactions among target genes . Relevant signaling pathways were also identified through pathway enrichment analysis . RESULTS : Our results showed that 56 differentially expressed genes were identified . Of them , P42224 , P02778 , O14543 , P35318 , P07996 , P04179 , and Q9H252 have been demonstrated involving in osteoporosis . Further , a bibliometric network was constructed between DEGs and other genes through the Biblio-MetReS . CONCLUSIONS : The results showed that P42224 could interact with P02778 through Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and Chemokine signaling pathway . P42224 interacted with O14543 through JAK/ P35610 pathway .
