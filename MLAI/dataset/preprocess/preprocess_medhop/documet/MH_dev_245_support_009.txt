Oxidative stress in susceptibility to breast cancer : study in Spanish population . BACKGROUND : Alterations in the redox balance are involved in the origin , promotion and progression of cancer . Inter-individual differences in the oxidative stress regulation can explain a part of the variability in cancer susceptibility.The aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms in genes codifying for the different systems involved in oxidative stress levels can have a role in susceptibility to breast cancer . METHODS : We have analyzed 76 single base polymorphisms located in 27 genes involved in oxidative stress regulation by SNPlex technology . First , we have tested all the selected SNPs in 493 breast cancer patients and 683 controls and we have replicated the significant results in a second independent set of samples ( 430 patients and 803 controls ) . Gene-gene interactions were performed by the multifactor dimensionality reduction approach . RESULTS : Six polymorphisms rs1052133 ( O15527 ) , rs406113 and rs974334 ( GPX6 ) , rs2284659 ( P08294 ) , rs4135225 ( P10599 ) and rs207454 ( P47989 ) were significant in the global analysis . The gene-gene interactions demonstrated a significant four-variant interaction among rs406113 ( GPX6 ) , rs974334 ( GPX6 ) , rs105213 ( O15527 ) and rs2284659 ( P08294 ) ( p-value = 0.0008 ) with high-risk genotype combination showing increased risk for breast cancer ( OR = 1.75 [ 95 % CI ; 1.26-2.44 ] ) . CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study indicate that different genotypes in genes of the oxidant/antioxidant pathway could affect the susceptibility to breast cancer . Furthermore , our study highlighted the importance of the analysis of the epistatic interactions to define with more accuracy the influence of genetic variants in susceptibility to breast cancer .
