Brominated cyclodipeptides from the marine sponge Geodia barretti as selective 5-HT ligands . The brominated cyclodipeptides barettin ( cyclo[(6-bromo-8-entryptophan)arginine] ) and 8,9-dihydrobarettin ( cyclo[(6-bromotryptophan)arginine] ) isolated from the marine sponge Geodia barretti have previously been shown to inhibit settlement of barnacle larvae in a dose-dependent manner in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 25 microM . To further establish the molecular target and mode of action of these compounds , we investigated their affinity to human serotonin receptors . The tryptophan residue in the barettins resembles that of endogenous serotonin [ 5-hydroxytryptamine ] . A selection of human serotonin receptors , including representatives from all subfamilies ( 1-7 ) , were transfected into P29320 -293 cells . Barettin selectively interacted with the serotonin receptors 5- Q13049 , P28335 , and Q13639 at concentrations close to that of endogenous serotonin , with the corresponding Ki values being 1.93 , 0.34 , and 1.91 microM , respectively . 8,9-Dihydrobarettin interacted exclusively with the P28335 receptor with a Ki value of 4.63 microM ; it failed to show affinity to 5- Q13049 and Q13639 , indicating that the double bond between the tryptophan and arginine residue plays an important role in the interaction with the receptor proteins .
