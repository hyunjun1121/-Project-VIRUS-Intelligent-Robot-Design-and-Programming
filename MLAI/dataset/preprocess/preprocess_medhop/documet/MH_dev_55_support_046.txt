Diabetes mellitus and macrovascular disease : mechanisms and mediators . Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition initiated in the endothelium in response to injury and maintained through the interactions between modified lipoproteins , macrophages , and arterial wall constituents . Risk for macrovascular disease is substantially increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Factors underlying the link between insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease include reduced adiponectin concentration , increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and consequent adhesion of T-lymphocytes to the coronary endothelium , procoagulability with increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) -1 , and instability of atherosclerotic plaques resulting from increased expression by macrophages of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma and increase adiponectin . TZD therapy is associated with decreases in hepatic fat content and glycosylated hemoglobin and an increase in hepatic glucose disposal . TZDs lower circulating free fatty acid concentration and triglyceride content in the liver , but not in skeletal muscle . Effects of P37231 agonists in vitro and in animal models provide evidence for additional potential antiatherosclerotic benefits in patients with diabetes beyond the treatment of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia , including the reduction of expression of macrophage MMPs and scavenger receptor-1 , and indirect reduction of P05121 and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation , via suppression of type 1 angiotensin-2 receptor expression . Dual Q07869 /gamma agonists , retinoid receptor agonists , and , to a lesser extent , TZDs , also stimulate cholesterol efflux from macrophages in vitro .
