Agonists and antagonists of DB00644 and -II reduce metastasis formation by triple-negative human breast cancer cells in vivo . Metastasis to bone is a frequent problem of advanced breast cancer . Particularly breast cancers , which do not express estrogen and progesterone receptors and which have no overexpression/amplification of the P04626 -neu gene , so called triple-negative breast cancers , are considered as very aggressive and possess a bad prognosis . About 60 % of all human breast cancers and about 74 % of triple-negative breast cancers express receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) , which might be used as a therapeutic target . Recently , we could show that bone-directed invasion of human breast cancer cells in vitro is time- and dose-dependently reduced by DB00644 analogs . In the present study , we have analyzed whether DB00644 analogs are able to reduce metastases of triple-negative breast cancers in vivo . In addition , we have evaluated the effects of DB00644 analogs on tumor growth . To quantify formation of metastasis by triple-negative MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancers , we used a real-time PCR method based on detection of human-specific alu sequences measuring accurately the amount of human tumor DNA in athymic mouse organs . To analyze tumor growth , the volumes of breast cancer xenotransplants into nude mice were measured . We could demonstrate that DB00644 analogs significantly reduced metastasis formation by triple-negative breast cancer in vivo . In addition , we could show that DB00644 analogs significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer into nude mice . Side effects were not detectable . In conclusion , DB00644 analogs seem to be suitable drugs for an efficacious therapy for triple-negative , P30968 -positive human breast cancers to prevent metastasis formation .
