Comparative kinome analysis to identify putative colon tumor biomarkers . Kinase domains are the type of protein domain most commonly found in genes associated with tumorigenesis . Because of this , the human kinome ( the protein kinase component of the genome ) represents a promising source of cancer biomarkers and potential targets for novel anti-cancer therapies . Alterations in the human colon kinome during the progression from normal colon ( NC ) through adenoma ( AD ) to adenocarcinoma ( AC ) were investigated using integrated transcriptomic and proteomic datasets . Two hundred thirty kinase genes and 42 kinase proteins showed differential expression patterns ( fold change â‰¥ 1.5 ) in at least one tissue pair-wise comparison ( AD vs. NC , AC vs. NC , and/or AC vs. AD ) . Kinases that exhibited similar trends in expression at both the mRNA and protein levels were further analyzed in individual samples of NC ( n = 20 ) , AD ( n = 39 ) , and AC ( n = 24 ) by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR . Individual samples of NC and tumor tissue were distinguishable based on the mRNA levels of a set of 20 kinases . Altered expression of several of these kinases , including chaperone activity of bc1 complex-like ( Q8NI60 ) kinase , bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 1B ( Q9UIG0 ) kinase , calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit delta ( Q13557 ) , serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 ( Q9Y6E0 ) , vaccinia-related kinase 3 ( Q8IV63 ) , and DB01361 kinase 3 ( Q9H2K8 ) , has not been previously reported in tumor tissue . These findings may have diagnostic potential and may lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions for colorectal cancer .
