Nongenotropic , anti-apoptotic signaling of 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 and analogs through the ligand binding domain of the vitamin D receptor in osteoblasts and osteocytes . Mediation by Src , phosphatidylinositol 3- , and JNK kinases . Because sex steroids regulate the life span of bone cells by modulating cytoplasmic kinase activity via a nongenotropic action of their classical receptors , we have explored the possibility that the vitamin D nuclear receptor ( P11473 ) might exhibit similar nongenotropic actions . We report that the conformationally flexible full P11473 agonist , 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) , and the 6-s-cis-locked 1alpha,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 ( JN ) analog , also acting through the P11473 but with poor transcriptional activity , protected murine osteoblastic or osteocytic cells from apoptosis . This effect was reproduced in HeLa cells transiently transfected with either wild type P11473 or a mutant consisting of only the P11473 ligand binding domain . The P11473 ligand binding domain bound [3H] DB00136 as effectively as wild type P11473 but did not induce vitamin D response element-mediated transcription . The anti-apoptotic effects of DB00136 and the 6-s-cis-locked 1alpha,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 analog in calvaria cells were blocked by three cytoplasmic kinase inhibitors : Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ( P50391 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor Wortmannin , and the JNK kinase inhibitor SP600125 . However , inhibition of p38 with SB203580 or P29323 with either U0126 or a transfected dominant negative MEK did not interfere with these anti-apoptotic actions . Further , DB00136 induced rapid ( 5 min ) association of P11473 with Src kinase in OB-6 cells . Finally , actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented the anti-apoptotic effect of DB00136 , indicating that transcriptional events are also required . These findings suggest that nongenotropic modulation of kinase activity is also a general property of the P11473 and that ligands that activate nongenotropic signals , but lack transcriptional activity , display different biological profiles from the steroid hormone DB00136 .
