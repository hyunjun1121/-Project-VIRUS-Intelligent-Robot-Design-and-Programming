Oral aspirin challenges in patients with a history of intolerance to single non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Summary Background In the clinical practice patients with a history of acute urticaria induced by a single non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) and seeking for safe alternative drugs generally undergo tolerance tests with alternative NSAIDs that have little or no cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) enzyme inhibitory activity . This practice does not allow for the detection of single NSAID reactors and may lead to unnecessary avoidance of many potentially useful NSAIDs . OBJECTIVE : Evaluate aspirin challenge as a means to distinguish single from multiple NSAID intolerance in patients with a clinical history of acute urticaria induced by a single NSAID . Methods One hundred and seventeen otherwise normal subjects with a history of acute urticaria following the ingestion of a single NSAID ( pyrazolones ( n=58 ) , nimesulide ( n=17 ) , propionic acid derivatives ( n=13 ) , aryl acetic acid derivatives ( n=14 ) , acetaminophen ( n=9 ) , piroxicam ( n=5 ) , and indometacin ( n=1 ) ) underwent single-blind placebo-controlled oral challenges with aspirin . DB00945 -intolerant subjects underwent further tolerance tests drugs exerting little or no inhibitory activity on P23219 enzyme ( including paracetamol , nimesulide , rofecoxib , tramadol , and floctafenine ) . Results DB00945 induced urticaria in 28/117 ( 24 % ) patients . Five out of 28 ( 18 % ) aspirin reactors did not tolerate alternative NSAID on subsequent oral challenges . Conclusion In subjects with a history of urticaria induced by a single NSAID ( other than aspirin ) the diagnostic workup should start with an aspirin challenge in order to detect single/multiple NSAID reactors .
