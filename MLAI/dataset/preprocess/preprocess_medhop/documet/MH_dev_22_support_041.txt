Exposure-response relationship of DB05773 : insight into dose optimization for patients with P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Exposure-response ( E-R ) analyses for ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 , Kadcyla ) were performed using data from a randomized , active control ( lapatinib plus capecitabine ) trial in patients with human epidermal growth factor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer . Kaplan-Meier survival analyses stratified by DB05773 trough concentration on day 21 of cycle 1 ( Cmin,C1D21 ) were performed for overall survival ( OS ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) . E-R analyses indicated that after adjusting for baseline risk factors , higher DB05773 exposure is associated with improved efficacy . DB05773 -treated patients with Cmin,C1D21 lower than the median value had values of OS and PFS comparable to those of the active control arm . The percentage of patients who received DB05773 dose adjustments was similar across the exposure range and was lower than that of the active control arm . Our findings suggest that there may be an opportunity to optimize Kadcyla dose in the patient subgroup with low DB05773 exposure for improved efficacy with acceptable tolerability .
