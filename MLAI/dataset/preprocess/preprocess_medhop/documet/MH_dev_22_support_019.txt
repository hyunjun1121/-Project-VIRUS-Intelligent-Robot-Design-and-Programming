Enhanced antitumor activity of trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) in combination with pertuzumab in a P04626 -positive gastric cancer model . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -targeted therapy by trastuzumab has become increasingly important for treating P04626 -positive cancers , and trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) is expected to serve as an effective alternative to trastuzumab . DB06366 , a P04626 dimerization inhibitor , showed prolonged progression-free survival when used with trastuzumab for P04626 -positive breast cancer . In this study , we investigated the effect of combining DB05773 and pertuzumab on xenografted gastric tumors . DB05773 as a single agent showed significant antitumor activity in all the three P04626 -high expression tumor models tested ( NCI-N87 , P35240 and 4-1ST ) but was ineffective against two P04626 -low expression tumors ( SNU-16 and MKN-28 ) . Using the DB05773 -sensitive NCI-N87 model , the combination efficacy of DB05773 and pertuzumab was elucidated . The combination induced significant tumor regression , whereas DB05773 or pertuzumab alone did not . In cultured NCI-N87 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) or heregulin-Î± , concomitant treatment of DB05773 and pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent alone . Only the combination significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of P00533 or P21860 , and its downstream factor AKT . Suppressed P21860 phosphorylation by the combination was also seen in the NCI-N87 xenografted tumors . Compared to single agent treatments , the combination treatment significantly enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) against NCI-N87 cells . These findings suggest that DB05773 in combination with pertuzumab shows significant antitumor activity by increasing AKT signal inhibition and ADCC in P04626 -positive gastric cancers .
