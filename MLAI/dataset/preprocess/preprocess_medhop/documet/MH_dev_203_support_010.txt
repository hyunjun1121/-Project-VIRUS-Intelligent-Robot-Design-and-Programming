Follicular carcinoma presenting as autonomous functioning thyroid nodule and containing an activating mutation of the DB00024 receptor ( T620I ) and a mutation of the Ki- DB01367 ( G12C ) genes . Most autonomous functioning thyroid nodules ( AFTN ) are benign thyroid follicular neoplasms . There are rare reports of malignant hot nodules , in which activating mutations of the DB00024 receptor ( P16473 ) were found . We report a case of follicular carcinoma presenting as an AFTN causing subclinical hyperthyroidism in a 64-year-old woman who had a 6-cm hot nodule in the left thyroid lobe . Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues from the tumor and extratumoral thyroid tissue . Sequence analyses revealed point mutations in two different genes : the normal ACC sequence at codon 620 of the P16473 gene was replaced by ATC , changing the threonine by isoleucine ( T620I ) ; and the wild-type P19440 at codon 12 of Ki- DB01367 mutated to TGT , replacing glycine by cysteine ( G12C ) . In transfection experiments the T620I mutant showed constitutive activity in terms of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( DB02527 ) production when permanently transfected in 3T3 cells . Here , we describe for the first time an activating mutation in 3codon 620 of the P16473 . In addition , the cancerous AFTN also contained a G12C Ki- DB01367 mutation . We hypothesize that the combination of these two mutations might have played an important role in both the hyperfunction of the tumor and the carcinogenetic process .
