Upregulation of P51787 / P15382 K+ channels by Q9UEF7 . Q9UEF7 is a transmembrane protein expressed primarily in kidney , parathyroid gland , and choroid plexus . The extracellular domain could be cleaved off and released into the systemic circulation . Q9UEF7 is in part effective as β-glucuronidase regulating protein stability in the cell membrane . Q9UEF7 is a major determinant of aging and life span.Overexpression of Q9UEF7 increases and Q9UEF7 deficiency decreases life span . Q9UEF7 deficiency may further result in hearing loss and cardiac arrhythmia . The present study explored whether Q9UEF7 modifies activity and protein abundance of P51787 / P15382 , a K(+) channel required for proper hearing and cardiac repolarization . To this end , cRNA encoding P51787 / P15382 was injected in Xenopus oocytes with or without additional injection of cRNA encoding Q9UEF7 . P51787 / P15382 expressing oocytes were treated with human recombinant Q9UEF7 protein ( 30 ng/mL ) for 24 h . Moreover , oocytes which express both P51787 / P15382 and Q9UEF7 were treated with 10 μM DSA L ( D-saccharic acid-1,4-lactone ) , a β-glucuronidase inhibitor . The P51787 / P15382 depolarization-induced current ( I(Ks) ) was determined utilizing dual electrode voltage clamp , while P51787 / P15382 protein abundance in the cell membrane was visualized utilizing specific antibody binding and quantified by chemiluminescence . P51787 / P15382 channel activity and P51787 / P15382 protein abundance were upregulated by coexpression of Q9UEF7 . The effect was mimicked by treatment with human recombinant Q9UEF7 protein ( 30 ng/mL ) and inhibited by DSA L ( 10 μM ) . In conclusion , Q9UEF7 upregulates P51787 / P15382 channel activity by “mainly” enhancing channel protein abundance in the plasma cell membrane , an effect at least partially mediated through the β-glucuronidase activity of Q9UEF7 protein .
