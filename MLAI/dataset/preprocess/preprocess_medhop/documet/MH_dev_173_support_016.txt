The pulse wave analysis of normal pregnancy : investigating the gestational effects on photoplethysmographic signals . OBJECTIVE : Normal pregnancy is associated with profound alterations in the maternal cardiovascular system and PPG represents a sensitive and convenient technique capable of tracking changes in the pulsatile function of arteries . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal cardiovascular alterations on the finger tip photoplethysmography ( PPG ) during normal gestation . METHODS : Thirty five healthy pregnant women were studied at each trimester of pregnancy and again on gestational age using PPG signals , peripheral blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) . RESULTS : Comparing with nonpregnant controls , several characteristic differences in PPG derived parameters and morphologies occurred in the pregnant . P05121 , RI , PTT as well as AUC1 and Q03519 of bcAUC1 were different and significant difference had been found in second and third trimester , despite little change in the peripheral blood pressure . The mean heart rate increased linearly with gestational age . CONCLUSION : This study has confirmed that normal pregnancy is associated with profound alterations in PPG signals occurred principally as a result of maternal cardiovascular adaptation and PPG-based noninvasive assessment of cardiovascular activities is feasible throughout pregnancy . Using this technique we demonstrated a delay in wave reflection within the arterial tree and a reduction in magnitude of arterial wave reflections in normal pregnancy which is consistent with previous observations and the known cardiovascular changes of pregnancy .
