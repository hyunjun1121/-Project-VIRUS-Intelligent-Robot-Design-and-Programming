Imatinib inhibits P15692 -independent angiogenesis by targeting neuropilin 1-dependent P00519 activation in endothelial cells . To enable new blood vessel growth , endothelial cells ( ECs ) express neuropilin 1 ( NRP1 ) , and NRP1 associates with the receptor tyrosine kinase P35968 after binding the vascular endothelial growth factor A ( P15692 ) to enhance arteriogenesis . We report that NRP1 contributes to angiogenesis through a novel mechanism . In human and mouse ECs , the integrin ligand fibronectin ( FN ) stimulated actin remodeling and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion component paxillin ( P49023 ) in a P15692 / P35968 -independent but NRP1-dependent manner . NRP1 formed a complex with P00519 that was responsible for FN-dependent P49023 activation and actin remodeling . This complex promoted EC motility in vitro and during angiogenesis on FN substrates in vivo . Accordingly , both physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the retina were inhibited by treatment with Imatinib , a small molecule inhibitor of P00519 which is widely used to prevent the proliferation of tumor cells that express P11274 - P00519 fusion proteins . The finding that NRP1 regulates angiogenesis in a P15692 - and P35968 -independent fashion via P00519 suggests that P00519 inhibition provides a novel opportunity for anti-angiogenic therapy to complement P15692 or P35968 blockade in eye disease or solid tumor growth .
