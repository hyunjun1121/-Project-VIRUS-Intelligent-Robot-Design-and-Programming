Meloxicam . Meloxicam ( DB00814 trade mark , Boehringer Ingelheim ) is a relatively new oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the US . It has also been evaluated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis and acute ' rheumatic ' pain . Meloxicam has been shown to be P35354 preferential , particularly at its lowest therapeutic dose , and is anti-inflammatory by inhibiting prostanoid synthesis in inflammatory cells . Since it is P35354 preferential , it would be expected to have less gastrointestinal toxicity than non-selective NSAIDs . In clinical trials of meloxicam in osteoarthritis , it was found to be as effective as piroxicam , diclofenac and naproxen with less clinical gastrointestinal symptoms and less perforations , obstructions and bleeds by meta-analysis . Adverse events , including peripheral oedema and hypertension , occurred at a similar rate as with traditional NSAIDs .
