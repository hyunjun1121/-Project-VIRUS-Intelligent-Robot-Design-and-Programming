P08069 targeted therapeutics : novel compounds and novel treatment strategies for cancer medicine . The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) and its associated signalling system has provoked considerable interest over recent years as a novel therapeutic target in cancer . A brief outline of the IGF-1R signalling system and the rationale for its use in cancer medicine is given . This is followed by a discussion of the different possible targets within the IGF-1R system , and drugs developed to interact at each target . A systems-based approach is then used to review the in vitro and in vivo data in the published literature of the following compounds targeting IGF-1R components using specific examples : growth hormone releasing hormone antagonists ( e.g. JV-1-38 ) , growth hormone receptor antagonists ( e.g. pegvisomant ) , IGF-1R antibodies ( e.g. CP-751,871 , AVE1642/EM164 , DB05759 , P35240 -717454 , BIIB022 , Q99217 479 , MK-0646/h7C10 ) , and IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( e.g. BMS-536942 , BMS-554417 , DB00238 -AEW541 , DB00238 -ADW742 , AG1024 , potent quinolinyl-derived imidazo (1,5-a)pyrazine PQIP , picropodophyllin PPP , Nordihydroguaiaretic acid Insm-18/NDGA ) . The following tumour types are specifically discussed : lung , breast , colorectal , pancreatic , NETs , sarcoma , prostate , leukaemia , multiple myeloma . Other tumour types are mentioned briefly : squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck , melanoma , glioblastoma , ovary , gastric and mesothelioma . Results of early stage clinical trials , involving recently patented drugs. are included where appropriate . We then outline the current understanding of toxicity related to IGF-1R targeted therapy , and finally outline areas for further research .
