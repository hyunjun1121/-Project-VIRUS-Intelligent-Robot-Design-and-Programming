DB08816 increases adenosine plasma concentration in patients with an acute coronary syndrome . OBJECTIVES : This study aimed to investigate the impact of ticagrelor on adenosine plasma concentration ( P25054 ) in acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patients . BACKGROUND : DB08816 is a direct-acting Q9H244 -adenosine diphosphate receptor blocker . The clinical benefit of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in ACS patients suggests that the drug has non-platelet-directed properties . Animal and in vitro models suggested that the " pleiotropic " properties of ticagrelor may be related to an interaction with adenosine metabolism . METHODS : We prospectively randomized 60 ACS patients to receive ticagrelor or clopidogrel . The P25054 was measured by liquid chromatography . To assess the mechanism of P25054 variation , we measured adenosine deaminase concentration , adenosine uptake by red blood cells , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate production by cells overexpressing adenosine receptors . The Q9H244 -adenosine diphosphate receptor blockade was assessed by the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein index . RESULTS : Patients receiving ticagrelor had significantly higher P25054 than patients receiving clopidogrel ( 1.5 μM [ interquartile range : 0.98 to 1.7 μM ] vs. 0.68 μM [ interquartile range : 0.49 to 0.78 μM ] ; p < 0.01 ) . The P25054 was not correlated with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( p = 0.16 ) . Serum-containing ticagrelor inhibited adenosine uptake by red blood cells compared with clopidogrel or controls ( p < 0.01 for both comparisons ) . DB00640 deaminase activity was similar in serum of patients receiving clopidogrel or ticagrelor ( p = 0.1 ) . DB08816 and clopidogrel had no direct impact on adenosine receptors ( p = not significant ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB08816 increases P25054 in ACS patients compared with clopidogrel by inhibiting adenosine uptake by red blood cells .
