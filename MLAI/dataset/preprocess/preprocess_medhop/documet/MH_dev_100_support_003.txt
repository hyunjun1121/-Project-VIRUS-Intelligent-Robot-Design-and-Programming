Effect of lipoteichoic acid on P60568 and P05113 release from T lymphocytes in asthma and P48444 . Susceptibility to infections with gram-positive bacteria , which are an important trigger of exacerbations , is increased in P48444 and asthma . Unraveling the underlying mechanisms may help developing therapeutic strategies to reduce exacerbation rates . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) , a danger signal from gram-positive bacteria , on T cell cytokines related to bacterial infection defense in P48444 and asthma . T cell populations within peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were ex-vivo activated towards T(H)2/T(C)2 subtypes and subsequently stimulated with P01374 . P60568 and P05113 concentrations in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA comparative between non-smokers ( NS ) , current smokers without airflow limitation ( S ) , smokers with moderate to severe P48444 and mild to moderate asthmatics ( A ) ( each n=10 ) . P60568 and P05113 baseline levels were without differences between the cohorts . After T cell activation , P60568 and P05113 releases were increased in all cohorts , however , for P60568 this increase was significantly higher in S and by trend in P48444 compared to the other groups . P01374 time-dependently suppressed P60568 release in NS , S and P48444 but not in A . P01374 reduced P05113 release in P48444 and A but not in NS and S. Summarized , P01374 reduces T(H)2/T(C)2 cytokines indicating immunosuppressive effects , which are dysregulated in P48444 and asthma . This implies a misguided response to gram-positive bacterial infections , which might help to explain the increased susceptibility to bacterial infections in P48444 and asthma .
