Effects of docosahexaenoic acid on some megakaryocytic cell gene expression of some enzymes controlling prostanoid synthesis . Beneficial effects of docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) intake in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases are known , and platelets play a crucial role in cardiovascular complications . However , high doses of DB01708 may increase lipid peroxidation and induce deleterious effects , notably in platelets . This led us to investigate the effect of DB01708 on gene expression of some enzymes controlling redox status and prostanoid formation in human megakaryoblastic cells ( P29074 -01 cell line ) . P29074 -01 cells were incubated in presence of DB01708 ( 10 and 100 micromol/L ) for 6h . DB01708 enrichment up-regulated glutathione peroxidase-1 and thromboxane synthase mRNA . DB01708 increased gene catalase expression and up-regulated Q07869 beta/delta and Q07869 gamma mRNA in presence of high concentration of DB01708 . In conclusion , our results support an antioxidant mechanism of DB01708 . The effects of DB01708 on cellular redox status could , with others , provide an explanation for the beneficial influence of low consumption of DB01708 on cardiovascular events .
