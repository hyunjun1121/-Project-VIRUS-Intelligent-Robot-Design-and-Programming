[ Changes in chemokine receptor 4 , interleukin-6 , and collagen X expression in the ATDC5 cell line stimulated by cyclic tensile strain and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ] . OBJECTIVE : This study further explores the stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) /chemokine receptor 4 ( P61073 ) signaling axis mechanism in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis ( OA ) by detecting the changes in P61073 , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , and collagen X expression in the ATDC5 cell line stimulated by the cyclic tensile strain and P48061 . METHODS : P01308 -transferrin-selenium ( ITS ) was used to induce ATDC5 cells to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells . After three weeks , the cells were divided into two groups : those with and without cyclic tensile strain . These groups were further divided into the negative control and P48061 groups . Strain force of 20 % was applied . After 12 h , the total proteins were extracted from cells of the four groups , and Western blot analysis was used to detect the changes in P61073 , P05231 , and collagen X expression . RESULTS : P48061 could enhance P61073 , P05231 , and collagen X expressions in the chondrocytes , and 20 % tensile strain force could further upregulate the three factors . CONCLUSION : Under abnormal tensile force , P48061 can upregulate its specific receptor P61073 , thus increasing its-binding efficiency and resulting in the activation of the P48061 / P61073 axis . This condition enhances the expressions of P05231 and other inflammatory factors and directly damages to cartilage tissue . Such damage directly promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy , which enhances collagen X expression .
