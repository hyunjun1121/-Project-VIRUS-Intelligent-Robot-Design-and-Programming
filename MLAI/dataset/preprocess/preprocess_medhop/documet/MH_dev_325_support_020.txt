Production of leukotrienes in gonadotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated pituitary cells : potential role in luteinizing hormone release . DB00644 ( DB00644 ) stimulated the formation of two major metabolites of the P09917 pathway , leukotriene ( LT ) B4 and LTC4 , as well as luteinizing hormone ( LH ) release in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells . Several lines of evidence suggested the presence of a DB00644 -dependent pituitary endocrine system in which LTs act as second messengers for LH release : ( i ) DB00644 -dependent LT formation was observed within 1 min and immediately preceded DB00644 -induced LH release , whereas exogenous LTs stimulated LH release at low concentrations ; ( ii ) the dose responses of DB00644 -induced LT production and LH release were similar and both effects required the presence of extracellular Ca2+ ions ; ( iii ) DB00644 -induced LH release was blocked by up to 45 % following the administration of several LT receptor antagonists ; ( iv ) LTE4 action on LH secretion was entirely abolished by LT receptor antagonists ; and ( v ) an activator of protein kinase C acted synergistically with LTE4 to induce LH release . The major source of LT formation in the pituitary cell cultures appeared to be the gonadotrophs , as shown by P30968 desensitization experiments . The results demonstrate the presence of a DB00644 -activatable P09917 pathway in anterior pituitary cells and provide strong support for the hypothesis that LTs play a role in LH release in the DB00644 signaling pathway .
