[ GIST refractory to imatinib treatment ] . After the introduction of imatinib , the outcome for patients with advanced gastro-intestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) was vastly improved . However , resistance to imatinib has become a new problem . The cause of resistance to imatinib is the low sensitivity of gene mutations in the P10721 gene or PDGFRÎ± , or an acquisition of additional mutations , and a low plasma level of imatinib . DB01268 is the first drug that showed an effectiveness for treating GIST refractory to imatinib . New molecular target drugs for overcoming imatinib resistance are being developed now .
