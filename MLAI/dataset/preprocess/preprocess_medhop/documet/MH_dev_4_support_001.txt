The N-end rule pathway counteracts cell death by destroying proapoptotic protein fragments . In the course of apoptosis , activated caspases cleave ∼500 to ∼1,000 different proteins in a mammalian cell . The dynamics of apoptosis involve a number of previously identified , caspase-generated proapoptotic protein fragments , defined as those that increase the probability of apoptosis . In contrast to activated caspases , which can be counteracted by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , there is little understanding of antiapoptotic responses to proapoptotic protein fragments . One possibility is the regulation of proapoptotic fragments through their selective degradation . The previously identified proapoptotic fragments DB00151 - Q13546 , DB00151 - Q13077 , DB00128 - P38398 , DB00149 - P53667 , DB00135 - Q14511 , DB00125 - P55957 , DB00128 -BCL(XL) , DB00125 - O43521 (EL) , DB00128 - P54764 , and DB00135 -MET bear destabilizing N-terminal residues . Tellingly , the destabilizing nature ( but not necessarily the actual identity ) of N-terminal residues of proapoptotic fragments was invariably conserved in evolution . Here , we show that these proapoptotic fragments are short-lived substrates of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway . Metabolic stabilization of at least one such fragment , DB00151 - Q13546 , greatly augmented the activation of the apoptosis-inducing effector caspase-3 . In agreement with this understanding , even a partial ablation of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway in two specific N-end rule mutants is shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis . We also found that caspases can inactivate components of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway , suggesting a mutual suppression between this pathway and proapoptotic signaling . Together , these results identify a mechanistically specific and functionally broad antiapoptotic role of the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway . In conjunction with other apoptosis-suppressing circuits , the DB00125 /N-end rule pathway contributes to thresholds that prevent a transient or otherwise weak proapoptotic signal from reaching the point of commitment to apoptosis .
