Combined immunohistochemistry for the differential diagnosis of cystic jaw lesions : its practical use in surgical pathology . AIMS : Histopathological distinction of cystic jaw lesions , including odontogenic tumours , is challenging because their lining epithelia , which are basically stratified squamous epithelia , resemble each other , especially when they become hyperplastic from inflammatory reaction . The aim of this study was to seek practical measures to differentiate such lesions . METHODS AND RESULTS : Nineteen surgical specimens from unicystic ameloblastomas ( UAs ) , 17 from keratocystic odontogenic tumours ( KCOTs ) , 13 from dentigerous cysts ( DCs ) , 10 from lateral periodontal cysts ( LPCs ) and 20 from radicular cysts ( RCs ) , all of which contained both typical flat and rete-peg-shaped lining epithelia , were examined for their immunohistochemical profiles . Among them , keratin ( K ) 10 , Q04695 , perlecan , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) and UEA-I lectin binding ( UEA ) were selected as useful immunohistochemical markers for their differential diagnosis . P13645 was positive ( + ) in KCOT and DC . Q04695 was not present in RC . P98160 was found in UA , KCOT and Q16549 . P12004 + cells were found frequently in UA and KCOT . These localization patterns were constant even when linings were not flat . CONCLUSIONS : Using a combination of six kinds of immunohistochemical pattern , it is now possible to discriminate reliably and objectively these five cystic jaw lesions in routine practice .
