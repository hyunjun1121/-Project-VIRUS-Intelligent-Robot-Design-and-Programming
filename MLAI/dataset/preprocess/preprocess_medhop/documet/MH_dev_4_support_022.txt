Encapsulation of viral vectors for gene therapy applications . In gene therapy , a number of viruses are currently being used as vectors to provide transient expression of therapeutic proteins . A drawback of using free virus is that it gives a potent immune response , which reduces gene transfer and limits re-administration . An alternative delivery system is to encapsulate the virus in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) microspheres prior to administration . A recombinant adenovirus ( Ad ) expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was used to test the transduction efficiency of Ad encapsulated in microspheres on target cells . The number of infected cells that expressed GFP was measured by flow cytometry . It was demonstrated that encapsulated viral vectors could successfully transduce target cells with encapsulation efficiencies up to 23 % and that the level of transduction could be controlled by varying both the quantity of microspheres and the amount of Ad in the microspheres . High transduction efficiencies and its recognized biocompatibility make P00747 -encapsulated Ad an attractive alternative to the use of free virus in gene therapy applications . The infectivity of Ad was found to be significantly influenced by the processing conditions and changes in environmental factors . Free Ad and encapsulated Ad were able to infect both E1 complimenting cells ( P29320 293 ) and non-complimenting cells ( A549 ) , with the viral expression in P29320 293 cells being 2.1 times greater than for A549 cells .
