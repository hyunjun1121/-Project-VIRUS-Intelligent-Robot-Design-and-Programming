P34995 antagonist reduces blood-brain barrier leakage after cerebral ischemia . Disruption of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) after cerebral ischemia is considered to be the initial step in the development of brain injuries , and an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the tight junctional protein occludin has been shown to cause an increase in BBB permeability . DB00917 ( DB00917 ) appears to be associated with both toxic and protective effects on neuronal survival in vitro . However , it remains to be determined whether the prostanoid EP1 receptor is involved in the disruption of the BBB after cerebral ischemia . So we examined the effect of a prostanoid EP1 receptor antagonist , SC51089 , on BBB leakage and tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin after cerebral ischemia . We demonstrated that SC51089 attenuated the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin in isolated brain capillaries , which was coincident with a decrease in BBB leakage . These results suggest that the prostanoid EP1 receptor is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin at tight junction , which may lead to disruption of the BBB and be linked to the development of cerebral infarctions .
