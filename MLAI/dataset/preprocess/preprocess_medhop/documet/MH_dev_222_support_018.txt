P35367 mRNA is expressed in capsaicin-insensitive sensory neurons with neuropeptide Y-immunoreactivity in guinea pigs . P35367 mRNA-expressing sensory neurons in guinea pigs are unmyelinated and are not immunoreactive to DB05875 and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) [ Mol. Brain Res. 66 ( 1999 ) 24 ] , which are implicated in the nociceptive transmission of the primary sensory system . In this study , we examined whether these H1 receptor mRNA-expressing neurons are sensitive to capsaicin by using in situ hybridization histochemistry . Of lumbar dorsal root ganglion ( Q86YR7 ) neurons in control animals , 17 % were positive for P80511 . In guinea pigs neonatally treated with capsaicin ( 50 mg/kg ) , few P80511 -immunoreactive neurons were seen in the DRGs . However , the percentages of H1 receptor mRNA-expressing neurons ( 15-20 % ) and the intensity of the mRNA signals in these neurons were not affected by neonatal capsaicin treatment . We also revealed the presence of both capsaicin-sensitive and insensitive neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) -immunoreactive neurons in the DRGs . These neurons were exclusively small . H1 receptor mRNA was expressed in P01303 -immunoreactive neurons in naive guinea pig DRGs . These results suggest that H1 receptor mRNA is expressed in capsaicin-insensitive Q86YR7 neurons with P01303 -immunoreactivity in guinea pigs .
