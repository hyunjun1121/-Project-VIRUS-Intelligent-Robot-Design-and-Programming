Target genes discovery through copy number alteration analysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma . High-throughput short-read sequencing of exomes and whole cancer genomes in multiple human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cohorts confirmed previously identified frequently mutated somatic genes , such as P04637 , P35222 and O15169 , and identified several novel genes with moderate mutation frequencies , including O14497 , Q68CP9 , Q03164 , MLL2 , Q8NEZ4 , MLL4 , P14316 , Q13315 , CDKN2A , O95750 , P42336 , P51812 , P23458 , Q14145 , Q16236 , Q7Z3J2 , LEPR , P15153 , and P40189 . Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling , Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling , JAK/ P35610 signaling , and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis . Nevertheless , because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy , the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task . Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain , copy number alteration ( Q08209 ) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons , homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression . Moreover , integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data , such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models , provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients .
