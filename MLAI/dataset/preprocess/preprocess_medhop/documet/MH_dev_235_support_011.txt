Phosphorylation and recycling kinetics of G protein-coupled receptors . The rate of ligand-induced phosphorylation of the V2 and V1a vasopressin receptors was characterized in P29320 293 cells . Both receptors were phosphorylated predominantly by GRKs , and the V1a receptor was also phosphorylated by protein kinase C regardless of the presence or absence of ligand . Phosphorylation of the P37288 catalyzed by GRKs reached maximal values at the shortest measured time : 15 seconds , and decayed rapidly with a t1/2 of 6 min in the continuous presence of AVP . In agreement with the hypothesis that dephosphorylation must precede receptor recycling to the cell surface , the P37288 returned rapidly to the cell surface after removal of the hormone from the medium . Phosphate incorporation into the P30518 proceeded at a slower pace , and the internalized phosphorylated receptor failed to recycle to the cell surface and retained its phosphate for a long time in the presence or absence of ligand . A single mutation in the carboxy terminus of the P30518 accelerated de-phosphorylation of the protein and conferred recycling properties to the P30518 . These experiments provided molecular evidence for the hypothesis that internalization is required for de-phosphorylation and recycling of reactivated G protein coupled receptors to the cell surface .
