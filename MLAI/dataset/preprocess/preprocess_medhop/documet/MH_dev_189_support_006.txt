Molecular markers for novel therapeutic strategies in pancreatic endocrine tumors . OBJECTIVES : Pancreatic endocrine tumors ( PETs ) share numerous features with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine ( carcinoid ) tumors . Targets of novel therapeutic strategies previously assessed in carcinoid tumors were analyzed in PETs ( 44 cases ) . METHODS : Activating mutations in P00533 , P10721 , and P16234 and nonresponse mutations in P01116 were evaluated . Copy number of P00533 and HER-2/neu was quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization . Expression of P00533 , P16234 , P17948 , P36897 , Hsp90 , SSTR2A , P35346 , P08069 , P42345 , and P16455 was measured immunohistochemically . RESULTS : Elevated P00533 copy number was found in 38 % of cases but no P01116 nonresponse mutations . P17948 , P36897 , P16234 , P35346 , SSTR2A , and P08069 exhibited the highest levels of expression in the largest percentages of PETs.Anticancer drugs BMS-754807 ( selective for P08069 /IR ) , 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17- P29372 , targeting Hsp90 ) , and axitinib ( directed toward P17948 -3/ P16234 -B/ P10721 ) induced growth inhibition of human QGP-1 PET cells with IC50 values ( nM ) of 273 , 723 , and 743 , respectively . At growth-inhibiting concentrations , BMS-754807 inhibited P08069 phosphorylation ; 17- P29372 induced loss of P00533 , P08069 , and P35968 ; and axitinib increased P38936 ( P38936 ) expression without inhibiting P35968 phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : Results encourage further research into multidrug strategies incorporating inhibitors targeting P08069 or Hsp90 and into studies of axitinib combined with conventional chemotherapeutics toxic to tumor cells in persistent growth arrest .
