Antagonism by salvianolic acid B of lipopolysaccharide-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation in rabbits . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of salvianolic acid B on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) in rabbits . Continuous infusion of LPS was used to induce a DIC model in rabbits . Treatment with salvianolic acid B ( 1 , 3 or 6 mg/kg ) was started simultaneously with LPS infusion ( 0.5 mg/kg LPS in 60 mL saline ; 10 mL/h over a period of 6 h ) through the contralateral marginal ear vein . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) , platelet count and fibrinogen concentration were determined , as were plasma levels of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products ( Q9NRC9 ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , protein C activity , antithrombin III ( P01008 ) and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α concentration . The gradual impairment of haemostatic parameters was induced by continuous infusion of LPS . There were marked increases in APTT , PT , BUN , ALT and plasma P01375 -α and marked decreases in the platelet count , fibrinogen , Q9NRC9 , protein C and P01008 . The intravenous administration of 1 , 3 or 6 mg/kg salvianolic acid B attenuated the increases in APTT , PT , BUN , ALT and plasma P01375 -α and the decreases in fibrinogen , platelet , Q9NRC9 , protein C and P01008 induced by LPS infusion . These observations indicate that salvianolic acid B has an effect against LPS-induced DIC in rabbits .
