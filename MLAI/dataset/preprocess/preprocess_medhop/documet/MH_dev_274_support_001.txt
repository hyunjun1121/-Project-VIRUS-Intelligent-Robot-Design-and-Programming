Structural basis for inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 by flavopiridol . DB03496 has been shown to potently inhibit P06493 and 2 ( cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 ) and most recently it has been found that it also inhibits P50750 . The complex P50750 -cyclin T1 controls the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II . The present work describes a molecular model for the binary complex P50750 -flavopiridol . This structural model indicates that the inhibitor strongly binds to the DB00171 -binding pocket of P50750 and the structural comparison of the complex P24941 -flavopiridol correlates the structural differences with differences in inhibition of these CDKs by flavopiridol . This structure opens the possibility of testing new inhibitor families , in addition to new substituents for the already known leading structures such as flavones and adenine derivatives .
