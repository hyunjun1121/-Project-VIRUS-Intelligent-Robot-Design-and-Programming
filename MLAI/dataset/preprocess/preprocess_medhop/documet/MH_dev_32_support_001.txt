Effects of neuropeptides on human lung fibroblast proliferation and chemotaxis . An increase in subepithelial mesenchymal cells and associated connective tissue is a feature of bronchial asthma . We determined whether neuropeptides could modulate fibroblast activity , particularly with respect to proliferation and chemotaxis . Human lung fibroblasts were cultured with neurokinin A ( P20366 ) , DB05875 ( SP ) , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) , and calcitonin-gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) . After 48 h , fibroblast proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay based on the uptake and subsequent release of methylene blue . The chemotactic response to neuropeptides was determined with the use of a modified Boyden chamber . Both P20366 and SP ( 10(-7)-10(-4) M ) stimulated human lung fibroblast proliferation in Q03591 and IMR-90 fibroblasts . P01282 and P80511 had no effect on fibroblast proliferation . P20366 alone stimulated fibroblast chemotaxis maximally at 10(-10) M . P08473 ( NEP ) activity of 0.52 and 5.2 pmol/10(6) cells was assayed in IMR-90 and Hs68 fibroblasts , respectively . DB02557 ( 5 x 10(-6)-10(-5) M ) , an NEP inhibitor , enhanced fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . Thus neuropeptides have the potential to cause activation of mesenchymal cells , and neuropeptide release may contribute to the structural abnormalities observed in asthmatic airways .
