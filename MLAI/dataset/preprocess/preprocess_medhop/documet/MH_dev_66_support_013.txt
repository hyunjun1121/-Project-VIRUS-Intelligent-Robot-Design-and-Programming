DB06273 in pediatric rheumatology : the clinical experience . During the last two decades , clinical use of novel biological therapy has led to increased mechanistic understanding of complex rheumatological diseases . Conversely , basic and translational studies have led to development of new and varied therapeutic agents . These new medications which " target " specific steps in one or more immune pathways have the potential to control disease symptoms , improve quality of life and long-term prognosis , and perhaps in some , restore immunological tolerance . Use of these agents in clinical trials , combined with post-marketing surveillance , has revealed both the benefits and the undesirable side-effects of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) . In this review we focus on the use of tocilizumab , a monoclonal antibody directed against the P05231 receptor ( P08887 ) , which potently inhibits P05231 / P08887 signaling .
