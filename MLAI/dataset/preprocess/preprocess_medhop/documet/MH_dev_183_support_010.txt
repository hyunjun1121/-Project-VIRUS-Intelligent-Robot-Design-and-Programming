P00533 -directed monoclonal antibodies in non-small cell lung cancer . Several monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) have been evaluated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Cetuximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody , has been studied in combination with first-line chemotherapy in phase II and two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC . The phase III FLEX trial demonstrated an increase in survival for cisplatin/vinorelbine plus cetuximab compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced P00533 -expressing NSCLC . Cetuximab added to carboplatin/paclitaxel failed to improve progression-free survival in the BMS099 phase III trial . However , a meta-analysis of four randomized trials confirmed a significant survival benefit for platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab compared to chemotherapy alone . High P00533 expression of tumor cells was then shown to predict the benefit of cetuximab , whereas P01116 mutations and P00533 fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis were without predictive value . DB05101 and panitumumab have also been studied in phase II trials . DB09559 , a fully human monoclonal antibody , is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC . Cetuximab is also studied in combination with chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC .
