Neurotoxic effects of Q13148 overexpression in C. elegans . RNA-binding protein Q13148 has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases , including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia . We have engineered pan-neuronal expression of human Q13148 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans , with the goal of generating a convenient in vivo model of Q13148 function and neurotoxicity . Transgenic worms with the neuronal expression of human Q13148 exhibit an ' uncoordinated ' phenotype and have abnormal motorneuron synapses . Caenorhabditis elegans contains a single putative ortholog of Q13148 , designated TDP-1 , which we show can support alternative splicing of P13569 in a cell-based assay . Neuronal overexpression of TDP-1 also results in an uncoordinated phenotype , while genetic deletion of the tdp-1 gene does not affect movement or alter motorneuron synapses . By using the uncoordinated phenotype as a read-out of Q13148 overexpression neurotoxicty , we have investigated the contribution of specific Q13148 domains and subcellular localization to toxicity . Q8N1N2 -length ( wild-type ) human Q13148 expressed in C. elegans is localized to the nucleus . Deletion of either RNA recognition domain ( P23921 or P31350 ) completely blocks neurotoxicity , as does deletion of the C-terminal region . These deleted Q13148 variants still accumulate in the nucleus , although their subnuclear distribution is altered . Interestingly , fusion of TDP-1 C-terminal sequences to Q13148 missing its C-terminal domain restores normal subnuclear localization and toxicity in C. elegans and P13569 splicing in cell-based assays . Overexpression of wild-type , full-length Q13148 in mammalian cells ( differentiated M17 cells ) can also result in cell toxicity . Our results demonstrate that in vivo Q13148 neurotoxicity can result from nuclear activity of overexpressed full-length protein .
