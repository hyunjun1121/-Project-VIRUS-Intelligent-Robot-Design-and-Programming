Q15796 / P84022 in endothelium is indispensable for vascular stability via P21453 and P19022 expressions . Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) is involved in vascular formation through activin receptor-like kinase ( Q9UM73 )1 and P36897 . P36897 , which is expressed ubiquitously , phosphorylates Q15796 and P84022 , whereas endothelial cell ( EC ) -specific P37023 activates Q15797 and Q99717 . Because P36897 kinase activity is required for P37023 to transduce TGF-β signaling via Q15797 /5 in ECs , P36897 knockout ( KO ) mice were not able to give us the precise mechanisms by which TGF-β/ P36897 / Q15796 /3 signaling is implicated in angiogenesis . To delineate the role of Q15796 /3 signaling in endothelium , the Q15796 gene in P84022 KO mice was selectively deleted in ECs using Tie2-Cre transgenic mice , termed EC-specific Q15796 /3 double KO ( EC- Q15796 /3KO ) mice . EC- Q15796 /3KO embryos revealed hemorrhage leading to embryonic lethality around Q96BH3 .5 . EC- Q15796 /3KO embryos exhibited no abnormality of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in both the yolk sac and the whole embryo , whereas vascular maturation was incomplete because of inadequate assembly of mural cells in the vasculature . Wide gaps between ECs and mural cells could be observed in the vasculature of EC- Q15796 /3KO mice because of reduced expression of P19022 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 ( P21453 ) in ECs from those mice . These results indicated that Q15796 /3 signaling in ECs is indispensable for maintenance of vascular integrity via the fine-tuning of P19022 , P33151 , and P21453 expressions in the vasculature .
