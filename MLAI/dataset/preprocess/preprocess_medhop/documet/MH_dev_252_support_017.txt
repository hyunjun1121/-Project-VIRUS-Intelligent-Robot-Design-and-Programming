P84022 linker phosphorylation attenuates P84022 transcriptional activity and TGF-β1/ P84022 -induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal epithelial cells . Transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ) has a distinct role in renal fibrosis associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) of the renal tubules and synthesis of extracellular matrix . P84022 plays an essential role in fibrosis initiated by EMT . Phosphorylation of P84022 in the C-terminal SSXS motif by type I TGF-β receptor kinase is essential for mediating TGF-β response . P84022 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation in the linker region . However , the functional role of P84022 linker phosphorylation is not well characterized . We now show that P84022 EPSM mutant , which mutated the four phosphorylation sites in the linker region , markedly enhanced TGF-β1-induced EMT of P84022 -deficient primary renal tubular epithelial cells , whereas P84022 3S-A mutant , which mutated the C-terminal phosphorylation sites , was unable to induce EMT in response to TGF-β1 . Furthermore , immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis showed a marked induction of fibrogenic gene expression with a significant reduction in P12830 in P52789 human renal epithelial cells expressing P84022 EPSM . TGF-β1 could not induce the expression of α-SMA , vimentin , fibronectin and P05121 or reduce the expression of P12830 in P52789 cells expressing P84022 3S-A in response to TGF-β1 . Our results suggest that P84022 linker phosphorylation has a negative regulatory role on P84022 transcriptional activity and TGF-β1/ P84022 -induced renal EMT . Elucidation of mechanism regulating the P84022 linker phosphorylation can provide a new strategy to control renal fibrosis .
