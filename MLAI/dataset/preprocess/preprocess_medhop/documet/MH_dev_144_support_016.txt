Estradiol or genistein prevent Alzheimer 's disease-associated inflammation correlating with an increase Q07869 gamma expression in cultured astrocytes . Inflammation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The main inflammatory players in AD are the glial cells which initiate the inflammatory response . One of the earliest neuropathological changes in AD is the accumulation of astrocytes at sites of A beta deposition . It is desirable to find methods of tipping the balance towards anti-inflammatory state . Estrogenic compounds have shown anti-inflammatory and also antioxidant activity . Astrocytes were pretreated with 17-beta estradiol or with genistein , and 48 h later treated with 5 microM amyloid beta ( A beta ) for 24 h . We found that A beta induces inflammatory mediators , such as cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , interleukin 1 beta ( P01584 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) . All these effects were prevented when cells were pretreated with estradiol or genistein , demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects of estradiol or genistein in astrocytes in primary culture . The A beta-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory genes in cells is antagonized by the action of the PPARs ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ) . Here we detected an increase in P37231 expression in astrocytes in primary culture treated with A beta and estradiol or soy isoflavone genistein . Thus , some of the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogenic compounds may be mediated and activated by PPARs suppressing a diverse array of inflammatory responses caused by A beta in astrocytes in primary culture .
