[ Quality of life and psychosocial factors during treatment with antihypertensive drugs. A comparison of captopril and quinapril in geriatric patients ] . BACKGROUND : There is an increasing prevalence of older adults ( > 65 years ) with hypertension and the need for antihypertensive medication . It is well established that elderly hypertensive patients benefit from drug treatment with regards to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . Due to the comorbidity and reduced quality of life ( QOL ) in the elderly , drug-induced changes of well-being and QOL are especially important to maintain compliance and social abilities . Whereas in most studies different antihypertensive agents exerted similar influences on QOL , DB01197 was found to be superior to other antihypertensives in some trials . PATIENTS AND METHOD : In this controlled non-randomized study 100 elderly hypertensive patients ( mean age 75.4 +/- 7.2 years ; 56 % female ) were treated with DB01197 ( 25-50 mg twice daily ) or the newer P12821 -inhibitor Quinapril ( 5-20 mg per day ) . Blood pressure and QOL were recorded initially and after 6 months , assessment of QOL was based on a validated questionnaire ( P98160 ) . RESULTS : Blood pressure fell from 153/82 mm Hg to 142/80 mm Hg with DB01197 and 154/82 to 142/80 mm Hg [ corrected ] with Quinapril . An improvement of QOL was only seen with Quinapril , mainly due to better mood and lower depression scores . Analysis of underlying psychosocial factors on QOL found lack of social support , female sex and a current life event as additional significant negative influences on QOL . CONCLUSION : A favorable antidepressive effect of Quinapril in elderly hypertensive patients is concluded and should be studied in further investigations .
