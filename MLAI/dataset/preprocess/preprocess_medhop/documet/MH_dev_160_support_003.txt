[ Inflammatory bowel disease : from sulfasalazine to biologics ] . The arrival of biologics , in particular anti-Tumor Necrosis Facteur ( P01375 ) , at the end of the nineties , revolutionnized treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases . Concomitantly , immunosuppressants ( thiopurines , methotrexate ) are used more widely and earlier in the disease course . DB00065 and adalimumab are very effective in more than two-thirds of patients , including those with fistula . This efficacy is long lasting in one-third of patients . Main side-effects of anti- P01375 are opportunistic infections ( intracellular bacteria ) which should be prevented and diagnosed early . Anti- P01375 are safe in the long-term , however , there is a particular concern regarding the risk of hepatosplenic T cell lymphomas in young men receiving bitherapy with thiopurine and anti- P01375 . The old strategy of adapting the therapeutic response to severity of symptoms and disease activity has no impact on natural history of the disease and should be abandoned . Most authors now favour an aggressive therapeutic approach in selected patients , before they develop irreversible anatomic lesions . This new strategy may change natural history and will become safer with a better knowledge of side-effects of immunosuppressants and biologics and how to prevent them . Moreover development of new therapeutic agents may permit to avoid surgery in patients who do not respond to therapy .
