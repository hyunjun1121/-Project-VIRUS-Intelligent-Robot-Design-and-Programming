Polyamines and membrane transporters . In recent years , our understanding of the importance of membrane transporters ( MTs ) in the disposition of and response to drugs has increased significantly . MTs are proteins that regulate the transport of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics across the cell membrane . In mammals , two super-families have been identified : DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) and solute carrier ( O00585 ) transporters . There is evidence that MTs might mediate polyamines ( PA ) transport . PA are ubiquitous polycations which are found in all living cells . In mammalian cells , three major PA are synthesised : putrescine , spermidine and spermine ; whilst the decarboxylated arginine ( agmatine ) is not produced by mammals but is synthesised by plants and bacteria . In addition , research in the PA field suggests that PA are transported into cells via a specific transporter , the polyamine transport system(s) ( Q03393 ) . Although the Q03393 has not been fully defined , there is evidence that some of the known MTs might be involved in PA transport . In this mini review , eight O00585 transporters will be reviewed and their potential to mediate PA transport in human cells discussed . These transporters are O15245 , O15244 , O75751 , Q96FL8 , P30825 , P08195 , SLC12A8A , and Q86VW1 . Preliminary data from our laboratory have revealed that O15245 might be involved in the PA uptake ; in addition to one member of ABC superfamily ( P08183 protein ) might also mediate the efflux of polyamine like molecules .
