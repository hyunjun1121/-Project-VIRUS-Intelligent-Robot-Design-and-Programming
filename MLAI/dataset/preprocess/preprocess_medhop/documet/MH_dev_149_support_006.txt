[ Quantitative analysis of P11387 activity in human and rat glioma : characterization and mechanism of resistance to antitopoisomerase chemical , camptothecin-11 ] . DB00762 ( CPT-11 ) is a new derivation of camptothecin , a plant alkaloid antitumor agent . Previous studies indicated that antitumor activity of CPT-11 was mediated through interaction of the drugs with its target enzyme , P11387 ( topo I ) . In this study , we studied the relation between sensitivity to CPT-11 and topo I activity of glioma cells . Furthermore , we established CPT-11 resistant cell lines in order to elucidate potential mechanisms of drug resistance . A clear correlation between the sensitivities to CPT-11 and topo I activities in surgical glioma specimens was demonstrated . Activities of topo I in CPT-11 sensitive group ( IC50 values for CPT-11 ; < 50 micrograms/ml ) tended to be higher than those in CPT-11 resistant group ( IC50 values ; > or = 50 ) . Topo I activity may serve as a novel marker to predict the sensitivity of gliomas to topo inhibitors . CPT-11 resistance cell lines ( T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 ) respectively exhibit a 5.4- and 7.3-fold increase in resistance to CPT-11 . No differences in topo I activity and intracellular accumulation of CPT-11 were observed between parent and CPT-11 resistant lines . On the other hand , topo I from T98G/CPT-11 and P13671 /CPT-11 cells were at least 4- and 2-fold resistant to the inhibitory effect of the CPT-11 on the relaxation activity of topo I in comparison with their parent lines . This enzymological difference may be responsible for the resistance to CPT-11 .
