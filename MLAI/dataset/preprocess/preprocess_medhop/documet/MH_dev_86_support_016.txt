Q9BQB6 pharmacogenetics and pharmacoproteomics in patients on warfarin anticoagulant therapy : transthyretin precursor as a potential biomarker . BACKGROUND : Recognizing specific protein changes in response to drug administration in humans has the potential for the development of personalized medicine . Such changes can be identified by pharmacoproteomics approach based on proteomic technologies . It can also be helpful in matching a particular target-based therapy to a particular marker in a subgroup of patients , in addition to the profile of genetic polymorphism . DB00682 is a commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in patients with prosthetic valve disease , venous thromboembolism and stroke . METHODS AND FINDING : We used a combined pharmacogenetics and iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS pharmacoproteomics approach to analyze plasma protein profiles of 53 patients , and identified significantly upregulated level of transthyretin precursor in patients receiving low dose of warfarin but not in those on high dose of warfarin . In addition , real-time RT-PCR , western blotting , human P05231 ELISA assay were done for the results validation . CONCLUSION : This combined pharmacogenomics and pharmacoproteomics approach may be applied for other target-based therapies , in matching a particular marker in a subgroup of patients , in addition to the profile of genetic polymorphism .
