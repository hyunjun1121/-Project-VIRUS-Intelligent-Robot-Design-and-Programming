In search of the ideal immunopanel to distinguish metastatic mammary carcinoma from primary lung carcinoma : a tissue microarray study of 207 cases . BACKGROUND : Distinguishing metastatic carcinoma of breast origin ( MCBO ) to lung from primary lung carcinomas ( P98160 ) is a diagnostic quandary with clinical ramifications . Immunostains CK7 , CK20 , ER , PR , and Mammaglobin as well as pertinent negative stains are utilized but prove insufficient . We set out to identify stains either alone or as a group that would better discern between these 2 entities . DESIGN : Tissue microarrays of 109 MCBO to lung and 102 P98160 were stained with CK7 , CK20 , ER , PR , AR , Mammaglobin , Napsin A , GATA-3 , and Q15669 -1 . An H-score was calculated for each case and stain . RESULTS : The highest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for each stain was seen with GATA-3 ( 0.817 ) , Napsin A ( 0.817 ) , and Q15669 -1 ( 0.854 ) . When all possible combinations were analyzed , GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 proved to correctly classify with the highest accuracy ( 0.934 ) . Combinations of GATA-3 and Napsin A ( 0.920 ) and GATA-3 , Napsin A , and Q15669 -1 ( 0.933 ) were not significantly different from GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 . The odds ratios for each stain and combination of stains showed that those for GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 were divergent , signifying that cases with higher H-scores for GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 were more likely to be classified as MCBO and P98160 , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : GATA-3 and Q15669 -1 can correctly classify a case as either MCBO or P98160 in 93.4 % of cases . Although highly specific and sensitive for P98160 , Napsin A in lieu of Q15669 -1 or as an additional stain did not improve classification accuracy .
