P62937 and nuclear factor of activated T cells are essential in cyclosporine-mediated suppression of polyomavirus BK replication . Immunosuppressants have impacts on the development of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy . We previously demonstrated that cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) suppressed polyomavirus BK ( BKV ) replication . The role of cyclophilin A ( CypA ) and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) in DB00091 -imposed suppression of BKV replication was determined in this study . Results demonstrated that knockdown of CypA but not CypB significantly reduced BKV large T antigen ( TAg ) expression and BKV titer . Overexpression of CypA reversed CypA siRNA-induced inhibition in BKV TAg expression . In addition , CypA overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of DB00091 on TAg expression , suggesting CypA implicated in DB00091 -mediated anti-BKV effect . Knockdown of Q12968 abrogated TAg expression , while overexpression of Q12968 promoted TAg expression and augmented BKV promoter activity . Q12968 binding to the BKV promoter was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Renal histology also displayed an increase in Q12968 expression in tubulointerstitium of BKV-associated nephropathy . Furthermore , overexpression of Q12968 rescued DB00091 -mediated inhibition of BKV load and TAg expression . A DB00091 analog , NIM811 , which can not block NFAT functionality , failed to suppress TAg expression . In conclusion , CypA and NFAT are indispensable in BKV replication . DB00091 inhibits BKV replication through CypA and NFAT , which may be potential targets of anti-BKV treatment .
