Human parainfluenza virus-associated respiratory tract infection among children and genetic analysis of HPIV-3 strains in Beijing , China . The relevance of human parainfluenza viruses ( HPIVs ) to the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections ( Q9Y4X5 ) in China is unclear . From May 2008 to September 2010 , 443 nasopharyngeal aspirates ( NPAs ) from hospitalized pediatric patients ( age from 1 to 93 months ) in Beijing were collected and screened for HPIVs and other common respiratory viruses by real-time RT-PCR . Sixty-two of 443 samples were positive for HPIVs with 4 positive for HPIV-2 and 58 positive for HPIV-3 , indicating that HPIV-3 was the predominant virus present during the study period . A phylogenetic tree based on all the available HN ( hemagglutinin-neuraminidase ) sequences of HPIV-3 indicated that three distinct clusters ( A,B , and C ) were circulating with some temporal and regional clustering . Cluster C was further divided into sub-clusters , C1 , P06681 , P01024 and C4 . HPIV-3 from Beijing isolates belonged to sub-cluster P01024 , and were grouped with the isolates from two Provinces of China and the neighboring country of Japan . Genetic analysis based on entire HN gene revealed that the HPIV-3 isolates from Beijing were highly similar with 97.2 % -100 % identity at the nucleotide level and these could be divided into two closely related lineages , C3a and C3b . These findings suggested that there was co-circulation of multiple lineages of HPIV-3 in the Beijing region during the study period . This is the first study to describe the epidemiology and molecular characterization of HPIVs in China .
