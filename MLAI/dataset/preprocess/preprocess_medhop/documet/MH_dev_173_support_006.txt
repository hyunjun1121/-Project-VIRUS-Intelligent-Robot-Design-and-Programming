The role of cycloxygenase-2 in the rodent kidney following ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo . The role of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in the pathophysiology of renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury is still not fully understood . In order to elucidate the role of P35354 in ischaemia/reperfusion injury of the kidney , we have evaluated the effects of ischaemia/reperfusion on renal dysfunction and injury in ( i ) rats treated with either vehicle or the selective P35354 inhibitor parecoxib , and ( ii ) wild-type mice or mice in which the gene for P35354 has been deleted ( P35354 knock-out mice or P35354 (-/-) ) . Rats were subjected to bilateral renal ischaemia ( 45 min ) and reperfusion ( 6 h ) , and received parecoxib ( 20 mg/kg , i.v. ) 30 min prior to ischaemia and 3 h after the commencement of reperfusion . Serum urea , serum creatinine , serum aspartate aminotransferase , creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium were all used as indicators of renal dysfunction and injury . Mice ( wild-type and P35354 (-/-) ) were subjected to bilateral renal ischaemia ( 30 min ) and reperfusion ( 24 h ) after which renal dysfunction ( serum urea and creatinine ) and renal injury was assessed by histological analysis . DB08439 significantly augmented the degree of renal dysfunction and injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion in the rat . In addition , the degree of renal injury and dysfunction caused by ischaemia/reperfusion was also significantly augmented in P35354 (-/-) mice when compared to their wild-type littermates . These findings support the view that metabolites of P35354 protect the kidney against ischaemia/reperfusion injury , and ( ii ) that selective inhibitors of P35354 may worsen renal dysfunction and injury in conditions associated with renal ischaemia .
