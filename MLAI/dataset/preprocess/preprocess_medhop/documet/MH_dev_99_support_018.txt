The inhibitory effect and the molecular mechanism of glabridin on O14788 -induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells . Osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption are in balance to maintain a constant , homeostatically controlled amount of bone . Excessive bone resorption by osteoclasts is involved in the pathogenesis of bone-related disorders . In the present study , we evaluated the inhibitory effects of glabridin , a flavonoid purified from licorice root , on the receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand ( O14788 ) -induced osteoclast differentiation and its molecular mechanisms in murine osteoclast progenitor RAW264.7 cells . Glabridin significantly inhibited O14788 -induced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) activity , the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and resorption-pit formation . In mechanistic studies of the anti-osteoclastogenic potential of glabridin , we found that glabridin inhibited O14788 -induced expression of c-Fos and subsequent expression of O95644 , which is a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis . Interestingly , glabridin inhibited the O14788 -induced expression of signaling molecules ( Q9Y4K3 , Q9UQC2 , P28482 , P45983 and O14733 ) and osteoclast survival-related signaling pathways such as c-Src , PI3K and Akt2 . Glabridin also inhibited the bone resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts by inhibiting osteoclast-associated genes ( cathepsin K , P14780 , CAII , Q13488 , Q86WC4 and P51798 ) . Taken together , our data suggest that glabridin holds great promise for use in preventing osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting O14788 -induced activation of signaling molecules and subsequent transcription factors in osteoclast precursors and these findings may be useful for evaluating treatment options in bone-destructive diseases .
