Atrial natriuretic peptide binds to P01160 - Q96GN5 receptors in neuroblastoma cells or is degraded extracellularly at the DB00133 - DB00120 bond . P01160 - Q96GN5 receptors for atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) showed the following rank order of affinity in intact human neuroblastoma cells NB-OK-1 : human P01160 -(99-126) approximately human P01160 -(102-126) approximately rat P01160 -(99-126) ( P04264 17-32 pM ) > human P01160 -(103-126) > porcine brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) . Analogues truncated at the C-terminal extremity or devoid of a disulphide bridge , such as rat P01160 -(103-123) , rat C- P01160 -(102-121) , rat P01160 -(111-126) , rat P01160 -(99-109) and rat [desCys105,Cys121] P01160 -(104-126) and chicken P23582 , were not recognized . The occupancy of these high affinity P01160 - Q96GN5 receptors led to marked cyclic GMP accumulation in the presence of 3-isobutyl 1-methylxanthine . An ectoenzymic activity , partly shed in the incubation medium , provoked the stepwise release of DB00120 - DB00125 -[125I] DB00135 , DB00125 -[125I] DB00135 and [125I] DB00135 from rat [125I] P01160 -(99-126) , at an optimal pH of 7.0 . Its inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline , DB00974 and bacitracin but not by thiorphan suggests the contribution of at least one neutral metalloendopeptidase , distinct from EC 3.4.24.11 , for which P01160 showed high affinity .
