Q03135 interacts with 5- Q13049 serotonin receptors and profoundly modulates the signaling of selected Galphaq-coupled protein receptors . 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A ( 5-HT(2A) ) serotonin receptors are important for a variety of functions including vascular smooth muscle contraction , platelet aggregation , and the modulation of perception , cognition , and emotion . In a search for 5-HT(2A) receptor-interacting proteins , we discovered that caveolin-1 ( Cav-1 ) , a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae , complexes with 5-HT(2A) receptors in a number of cell types including P13671 glioma cells , transfected P29320 -293 cells , and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations . To address the functional significance of this interaction , we performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 in P13671 glioma cells , a cell type that endogenously expresses both 5-HT(2A) receptors and Cav-1 . We discovered that the in vitro knockdown of Cav-1 in P13671 glioma cells nearly abolished 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated signal transduction as measured by calcium flux assays . RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 also greatly attenuated endogenous Galpha(q)-coupled P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated signaling without altering the signaling of P25116 thrombin receptors . Cav-1 appeared to modulate 5-HT(2A) signaling by facilitating the interaction of 5-HT(2A) receptors with Galpha(q) . These studies provide compelling evidence for a prominent role of Cav-1 in regulating the functional activity of not only 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptors but also selected Galpha(q)-coupled receptors .
