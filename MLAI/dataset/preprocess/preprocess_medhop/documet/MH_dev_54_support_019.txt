DB00281 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis in vitro and in vivo . We demonstrated that upregulation of both gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress chaperones ( P11021 , calnexin , calreticulin , and P07237 ) and ER stress sensors ( P18850 , O75460 and Q9NZJ5 ) was induced by lidocaine , a local anesthetic , in PC12 cells . In addition to gene regulation , lidocaine also induced typical ER stress phenomena such as ART6 proteolytic cleavage , eIF2 alpha phosphorylation , and P17861 mRNA splicing . In in vivo experiments , while lidocaine downregulated gene expression of antiapoptotic factors ( Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl ) , pro-apoptotic factor ( Bak and Bax ) gene expression was upregulated . Furthermore , lidocaine induced apoptosis , as measured histochemically , and upregulated P09874 , a DNA damage repair enzyme . These results are the first to show that lidocaine induces apoptosis through ER stress in vitro and in vivo .
