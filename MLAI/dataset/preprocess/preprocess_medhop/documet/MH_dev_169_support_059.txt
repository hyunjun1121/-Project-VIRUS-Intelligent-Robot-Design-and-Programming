Characterization of canine platelet P16109 ( CD 62 ) and its utility in flow cytometry platelet studies . 1. P16109 ( P16109 , GMP140 , or CD62 ) a member of lectin-like adhesive proteins is expressed on the surface of activated degranulated canine platelets and is the calcium-dependent receptor for leukocyte adhesion . 2 . The electrophoretic mobility of P16109 , by Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation from radiolabeled membranes of canine and human platelets , was similar or identical and immunocytochemical studies localized P16109 in internal vesicles similar to the alpha granule localization in human platelets . 3 . Two antibodies to human P16109 KC4.1 and Q99440 .2 crossreacted with canine platelets whose surface binding , in response to agonists thrombin , calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , phorbol esters and ADP , was similar . 4 . Anti- P16109 antibodies in conjunction with crossreacting anti- P08514 /IIIa antibodies ( A2A9 , DB00054 , RUU-PL7F12 ) enables the analysis of activated platelets , platelet-derived microparticles and platelet-leukocyte interactions in canine models by flow cytometry .
