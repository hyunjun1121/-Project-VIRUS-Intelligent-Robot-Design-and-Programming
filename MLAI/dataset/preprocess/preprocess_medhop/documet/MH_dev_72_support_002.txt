DB00644 agonists reduce the migratory and the invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by interfering with the activity of P05019 . Androgen-independent prostate carcinoma is characterized by a high proliferation rate and by a strong metastatic behavior . We have previously shown that DB00644 agonists exert a direct and specific inhibitory action on the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells ( DU 145 ) . These compounds mainly act by interfering with the mitogenic activity of growth factors , such as the insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) . The present experiments were performed to clarify whether DB00644 agonists might also affect the migratory and the invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and to define their mechanism of action . First we showed that the DB00644 agonist DB00007 reduces the migration of DU 145 cells towards a chemoattractant and their ability to invade a reconstituted basement membrane . Experiments were then performed to clarify whether the DB00644 agonist might act by interfering with the pro-metastatic activity of P05019 . We found that , in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells , DB00007 : a ) interferes with the P05019 system ( receptor protein expression and tyrosine-phosphorylation ) ; b ) abrogates the P05019 -induced phosphorylation of Akt ( a kinase previously shown by us to mediate the pro-metastatic activity of P05019 in prostate cancer cells ) ; c ) counteracts the migration and the invasive activity of the cells stimulated by P05019 ; d ) abolishes the effects of P05019 on cell morphology , on actin cytoskeleton organization and on alphavbeta3 integrin expression/cellular localization . These data indicate that DB00644 agonists , in addition to their well known antiproliferative effect , can also exert a significant inhibitory activity on the migratory and invasive behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells , expressing the P30968 . DB00644 agonists act by interfering with the pro-metastatic activity of the growth factor P05019 .
