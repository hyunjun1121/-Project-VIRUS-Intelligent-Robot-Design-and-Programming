P11274 - P00519 induces neurite-like structures and P11274 lacking the SH2-binding domain induces cell rounding in PC12 cells . The activated tyrosine kinase oncoprotein P11274 - P00519 is responsible for pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive human leukemias . Because P11274 carries a P20936 ( P20936 ) activity toward cytoskeleton-related small GTP-binding proteins , we utilized a neuronal PC12 cell system to test morphogenic potentials of P11274 - P00519 or P11274 . We report here unique morphological phenotypes of PC12 cells expressing either P11274 - P00519 or a P11274 mutant which lacks the SH2-binding domain ( P11274 Delta162-413 ) . Although Q96HU1 kinase was not activated in PC12 cells expressing P11274 - P00519 , they showed incomplete neurite extensions even in the absence of the nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) . Overproduction of P11274 Delta162-413 in PC12 cells , on the other hand , induced cell rounding in the absence of P01138 . Interestingly , those cells could hardly make terminal differentiation in the presence of P01138 and continued to grow without changing their round shape , although P08138 as well as Q96HU1 kinase appeared to be activated . Interestingly , the botulinum P01024 toxin induced neurite-like structures in PC12 cells overexpressing P11274 Delta162-413 without P01138 .
