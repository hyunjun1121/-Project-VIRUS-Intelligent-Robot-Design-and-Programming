Concurrent pharmacological modification of cannabinoid-1 and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activity affects feeding behavior and body weight in rats fed a free-choice , high-carbohydrate diet . To extend preliminary studies on the effects on food intake of the combined use of cannabinoid ( CB ) 1 and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptor agonists and antagonists , the effect of these drugs on the feeding behavior in rats maintained on a free-choice , high-carbohydrate diet was investigated over a longer period of time . Rats were fed a standard diet for 3 days and then fed with both the standard and the high-sucrose chow . After 4 days of the high-calorie diet , the following combination treatments were administered daily by an intraperitoneal injection for the next 3 days : 1 mg/kg AM 251 ( a P21554 receptor antagonist ) or 1 mg/kg Q08050 55,212-2 ( a P21554 receptor agonist ) together with 3 µg/kg exendin-4 ( Ex-4 , a P43220 agonist ) or 160 µg/kg exendin ( 9-39 ) [ Ex ( 9-39 ) , a P43220 antagonist ] . The total daily caloric intake and body weight were significantly reduced in rats treated with Ex-4 and AM 251 or Q08050 55,212-2 compared with either of the drugs injected alone and the saline-injected controls . Both drug combinations selectively inhibited ingestion of the high-sucrose chow . Although Ex ( 9-39 ) administration did not significantly affect food consumption , it resulted in a marked body weight gain , indicating that the P43220 antagonist caused a positive energy balance . It is concluded that AM 251 or Q08050 55,212-2 and Ex-4 , injected together , exert additive , inhibitory effects on the consumption of high-sugar food .
