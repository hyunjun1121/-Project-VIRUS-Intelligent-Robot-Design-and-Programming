[ DB00594 attenuates hypoxia-induced proliferation of rats pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells by suppressing Na+/ H+ exchanger-1 ] . AIM : To study the influence of Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor amiloride on hypoxia-induced proliferation in rats pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs ) , also observe the change of Na+/H+ exchanger-1 ( P19634 ) activity and expression . METHODS : Rats PASMGs were cultured in normoxia ( 21 % O2 ) or hypoxia ( 2 % O2 ) for 24 hours , as well as administered amiloride with various concentrations , cultured for 24 hours , then determined MTT OD values and rates of P12004 positive cells to investigate cells proliferation , moreover intracellular pH was determined by interactive Laser Cytometer , and Na+/H+ exchanger-1 mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR . RESULTS : Hypoxic exposure heightened intracellular pH and mRNA expression of P19634 in PASMCs , however , 3.123-50 micromol/L amiloride depressed them gradually . Additionally , hypoxic exposure raised MTT OD value and rates of P12004 positive cells , similarly , the above two indexes descended gradually with presence of 3.125-50 micromol/L amiloride . CONCLUSION : Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor amiloride can suppress hypoxia-induced proliferation in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells , which is due to depress activity and expression of P19634 .
