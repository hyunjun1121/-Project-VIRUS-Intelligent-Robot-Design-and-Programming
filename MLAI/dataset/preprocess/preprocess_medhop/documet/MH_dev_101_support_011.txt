Interferon-γ promotes vascular remodeling in human microvascular endothelial cells by upregulating endothelin ( ET ) -1 and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) β2 . Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a complex disease characterized by vascular alterations , activation of the immune system and tissue fibrosis . Previous studies have implicated activation of the interferon pathways in the pathogenesis of SSc . The goal of this study was to determine whether interferon type I and/or type II could play a pathogenic role in SSc vasculopathy . Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells ( HDMVECs ) and fibroblasts were obtained from foreskins of healthy newborns . The RT Profiler PCR Array System was utilized to screen for EndoMT genes . Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-γ downregulated Fli1 and P33151 . In contrast , IFN-α and IFN-γ exerted opposite effects on the expression of α-SMA , P29279 , ET-1 , and TGFβ2 , with IFN-α downregulating and IFN-γ upregulating this set of genes . Blockade of TGFβ signaling normalized IFN-γ-mediated changes in Fli1 , P33151 , P29279 , and ET-1 levels , whereas upregulation of α-SMA and TGFβ2 was not affected . DB00559 treatment was more effective than TGFβ blockade in reversing the actions of IFN-γ , including downregulation of α-SMA and TGFβ2 , suggesting that activation of the ET-1 pathway plays a main role in the IFN-γ responses in HDMECs . IFN-γ induced expression of selected genes related to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EndoMT ) , including Snail1 , P02751 , P05121 , Q15672 , P40763 , P41220 , and components of the WNT pathway . The effect of IFN-γ on EndoMT was mediated via TGFβ2 and ET-1 signaling pathways . This study demonstrates distinct effects of IFN-α and IFN-γ on the biology of vascular endothelial cells . IFN-γ may contribute to abnormal vascular remodeling and fibrogenesis in SSc , partially via induction of EndoMT .
