DB06080 , a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor : inhibition of P36888 phosphorylation and signaling in acute myeloid leukemia . In 15 % to 30 % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , aberrant proliferation is a consequence of a juxtamembrane mutation in the P36888 gene ( P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication [ P36888 -ITD ] ) , causing constitutive kinase activity . DB06080 ( a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) inhibited the phosphorylation of P36888 , P42229 , and P29323 , as well as Pim-1 expression in MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 cells ( IC(50) approximately 1-10 nM ) harboring the P36888 -ITD . DB06080 inhibited the proliferation of these cells ( IC(50) = 4 and 6 nM , respectively ) through the induction of apoptosis ( increased sub-G(0)/G(1) phase , caspase activation , and PARP cleavage ) , whereas cells harboring wild-type (wt)- P36888 were less sensitive . In normal human blood spiked with AML cells , DB06080 inhibited phosphorylation of P36888 ( IC(50) approximately 100 nM ) , P42229 , and P29323 , and decreased Pim-1 expression . In methylcellulose-based colony-forming assays , DB06080 had no significant effect up to 1000 nM on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells , whereas in AML patient samples harboring both P36888 -ITD and wt- P36888 , DB06080 inhibited colony formation ( IC(50) = 100 and 1000 nM , respectively ) . DB06080 dose-dependently inhibited MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 flank tumor growth , prevented tumor formation , regressed established MV-4-11 xenografts , and increased survival by 20 weeks in an MV-4-11 engraftment model . In tumors , DB06080 inhibited P36888 phosphorylation , induced apoptosis ( transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling [ TUNEL ] ) and decreased proliferation ( Ki67 ) . DB06080 is under clinical development for AML .
