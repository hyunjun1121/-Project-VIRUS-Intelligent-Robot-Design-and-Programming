Q15109 /RAGE-mediated autophagy promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis and bioenergetics through the P05231 -pSTAT3 pathway . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) , the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States , is a complex disease that arises in the setting of genetic alterations ( P01116 , P38398 , Q13485 , CDKN2A/p16 ( INK4a ) and P04637 ) , epigenetic perturbations ( MIR155 , acetylation and methylation ) and epicellular events ( diabetes and inflammation ) . We have demonstrated that the advanced glycation end product-specific receptor ( Q15109 , also called RAGE ) contributes to pancreatic tumorigenesis . Targeted ablation of Q15109 diminishes the amount of autophagic flux and attenuates the development of early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PanIN ) lesions in a murine model of P01116 -drivien carcinogenesis . Autophagy ( programmed cell survival ) , a metabolic process of lysosome-mediated self-digestion , promotes pancreatic cancer growth . In pancreatic tumor cell lines , Q15109 -mediated autophagy promotes interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) -induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( pSTAT3 ) and mitochondrial localization of pSTAT3 . Enhanced mitochondrial pSTAT3 increases the pool of available DB00171 and increases cellular proliferation . Moreover , we observed a positive feedback loop between activation of autophagy and the P05231 -pSTAT3 pathway , perhaps different from the role of cytosolic nonphosphorylated P40763 , which has been reported to inhibit autophagy . These Q15109 -dependent changes were found during the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer development . These observations of inflammation and altered metabolism in PDA provide a pathological link to early precursor lesion development . Thus , Q15109 is an important inflammatory mediator that modulates crosstalk between prosurvival pathways , P05231 -pSTAT3 and autophagy , in PDA tumor cells , and contributes to early PanIN formation .
