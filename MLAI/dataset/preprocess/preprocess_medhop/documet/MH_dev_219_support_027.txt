Investigation of P25116 -type thrombin receptors in rat glioma P13671 cells with a novel monoclonal anti- P25116 antibody ( Mab COR7-6H9 ) . Rat glioma P13671 cells have been demonstrated to be a suitable model in the investigation of P25116 -type thrombin receptors in brain . However , anti- P25116 antibodies , which should be very helpful tools in studying P25116 in rat cells , have not been available up until now . Therefore , we prepared a monoclonal anti-thrombin receptor antibody ( Mab COR7-6H9 ) directed against the peptide sequence GRAVYLNKSRFPPMPPPPFISEDASG in the N-terminus below the thrombin cleavage site of the rat P25116 -type thrombin receptor . Using this antibody , we demonstrated the presence of P25116 binding sites on the plasma membrane of rat glioma P13671 cells both with confocal laser fluorescence and with scanning electron microscopy . In addition , Mab COR7-6H9 was shown to block P25116 -mediated transmembranal signaling as demonstrated by measurement of free intracellular calcium and cyclic AMP . This novel anti- P25116 antibody is therefore likely to be a very helpful tool in studying P25116 -type thrombin receptors in rat brain .
