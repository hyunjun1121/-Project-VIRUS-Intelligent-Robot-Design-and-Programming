Prevention of atherosclerosis by the P42345 inhibitor everolimus in P01130 -/- mice despite severe hypercholesterolemia . DB01590 inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) in proliferating cells . It is widely used in transplant patients and has also been exploited by drug-eluting stents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease . However , there is only limited data on the pathophysiological effects of P42345 -inhibitors on the vascular wall . We aimed to unravel the effects of everolimus on cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis and on circulating cell mediators in LDL-receptor-deficient ( P01130 (-/-) ) mice . Male hypercholesterolemic P01130 (-/-) mice received either solvent ( group A ; n=28 ) or everolimus at 0.05 mg/kg ( group B , n=22 ) and 1.5 mg/kg ( group C , n=29 ) per body weight per day by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps for the study period of 12 weeks . Group B showed 44 % reduction of atherosclerotic lesions at the brachiocephalic artery ( BCA ) . In group C atherosclerotic lesions were reduced by 85 % in the BCA and by 60 % at the aortic root . This was associated with a significantly lower complexity of lesions in both treated groups ( p < 0.001 ) and despite a 40 % increase of plasma cholesterol . DB01590 caused a significant reduction of circulating cell mediators such as interleukin-1alpha , interleukin-5 , GM- P04141 and interleukin-12p40 . DB01590 increased the plasma levels of KC but had no effect on eighteen other circulating cell mediators studied . DB01590 strongly inhibits atherosclerosis development in LDL-receptor(-/-) mice despite severe hypercholesterolemia . DB01590 application had only small effects on circulating cell mediators . The significant reduction of atherosclerotic lesions was associated with a delayed transition from early macrophages enriched lesions to advanced atherosclerotic plaques .
