DB00013 /urokinase receptor and vitronectin/alpha(v)beta(3) integrin induce chemotaxis and cytoskeleton reorganization through different signaling pathways . P04004 ( VN ) and pro-urokinase ( pro-uPA ) stimulated migration of rat smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent and additive way , and induced motile-type changes in cell morphology together with a complete reorganization of the actin filaments and of the microtubules . All these effects were inhibited by pertussis toxin , or by antibodies directed against the urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) or against the VN receptor alpha(v)beta(3) suggesting that an association between the two receptors is required to mediate both signals . Investigation of the signaling pathways showed that increasing the intracellular DB02527 resulted in a selective inhibition of VN-induced cell migration . On the other hand , PD 98059 , an inhibitor of MEK , differentially inhibited the pro-uPA- but not the VN-induced cell migration . Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Erk by pro-uPA was directly observed . We conclude that the signaling pathways of pro-uPA and VN must be at least in part different .
