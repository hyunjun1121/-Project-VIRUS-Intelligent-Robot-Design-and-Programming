Mechanical stretch increases P08253 production in vascular smooth muscle cells via activation of P09619 -β/Akt signaling pathway . Increased blood pressure , leading to mechanical stress on vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) , is a known risk factor for vascular remodeling via increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) within the vascular wall . This study aimed to identify cell surface mechanoreceptors and intracellular signaling pathways that influence VSMC to produce MMP in response to mechanical stretch ( MS ) . When VSMC was stimulated with MS ( 0-10 % strain , 60 cycles/min ) , both production and gelatinolytic activity of P08253 , but not P14780 , were increased in a force-dependent manner . MS-enhanced P08253 expression and activity were inhibited by molecular inhibition of Akt using Akt siRNA as well as by PI3K/Akt inhibitors , LY293002 and AI , but not by MAPK inhibitors such as PD98059 , SP600125 and SB203580 . MS also increased Akt phosphorylation in VSMC , which was attenuated by AG1295 , a PDGF receptor ( P09619 ) inhibitor , but not by inhibitors for other receptor tyrosine kinase including P01133 , IGF , and FGF receptors . Although MS activated P09619 -α as well as P09619 -β in VSMC , MS-induced Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by molecular deletion of P09619 -β using siRNA , but not by inhibition of P09619 -α . Collectively , our data indicate that MS induces P08253 production in VSMC via activation of Akt pathway , that is mediated by activation of P09619 -β signaling pathways .
