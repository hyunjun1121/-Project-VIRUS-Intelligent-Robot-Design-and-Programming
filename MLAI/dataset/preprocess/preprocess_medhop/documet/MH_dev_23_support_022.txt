Convergent and divergent cellular responses by ErbB4 isoforms in mammary epithelial cells . Associations of ErbB4 ( Q15303 / Q15303 ) , the fourth member of the P00533 family , with cancer are variable , possibly as a result of structural diversity of this receptor . There are multiple structural isoforms of Q15303 arising by alternative mRNA splicing , and a subset undergo proteolysis that releases membrane-anchored and soluble isoforms that associate with transcription factors and coregulators to modulate transcription . To compare the differential and common signaling activities of full-length ( FL ) and soluble intracellular isoforms of Q15303 , four JM-a isoforms ( FL and soluble intracellular domain ( ICD ) CYT-1 and CYT-2 ) were expressed in isogenic MCF10A cells and their biologic activities were analyzed . Both FL and ICD CYT-2 promoted cell proliferation and invasion , and CYT-1 suppressed cell growth . Transcriptional profiling revealed several new and underexplored Q15303 -regulated transcripts , including : proteases/protease inhibitors ( P08254 and P07093 ) , the YAP/Hippo pathway ( P29279 , O00622 , and P09486 ) , the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway ( P04035 , Q01581 , P01130 , and Q9UBM7 ) , and cytokines ( P10145 , P78556 , and P09341 ) . Many of these transcripts were subsequently validated in a luminal breast cancer cell line that normally expresses Q15303 . Furthermore , ChIP-seq experiments identified O75689 , P02649 , P09486 , P16949 , and Q05195 as novel molecular targets of Q15303 . These findings clarify the diverse biologic activities of Q15303 isoforms , and reveal new and divergent functions . IMPLICATIONS : ErbB4 as a regulator of Hippo and mevalonate pathways provides new insight into milk production and anabolic processes in normal mammary epithelia and cancer .
