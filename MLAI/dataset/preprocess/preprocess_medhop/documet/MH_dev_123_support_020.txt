The relationship between albuminuria and hormone therapy in postmenopausal women . BACKGROUND : Elevated urinary albumin excretion and hormone therapy ( HT ) are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events . We assessed the relationship between albuminuria and the use of hormonal preparations in postmenopausal women . METHODS : Data from the P01308 Resistance Atherosclerosis Study were obtained at baseline and 5-year follow-up for analysis . The generalized estimating equation procedure accounting for repeated measures was used for this analysis . HT was the main predictor variable , and log(e) urine albumin-creatinine ratio ( P10323 ) was the main outcome variable . RESULTS : Four hundred ninety-one menopausal women were included in the analysis , 36 % ( n = 179 ) of whom received HT ( either oral estrogen , progesterone , or combination therapy ) . At baseline , abnormal albuminuria ( P10323 > or = 25 mg/g ) was present in 11 % of women on HT and 17 % not on HT ( P = 0.02 ) . After adjusting for demographics , the presence of diabetes and hypertension , and kidney function , HT was associated with a 19 % reduction in P10323 ( P = 0.008 ) and an odds ratio of 0.67 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.43 to 1.01 ; P = 0.06 ) for the presence of abnormal albuminuria . Other predictors of abnormal albuminuria included diabetes , blood pressure , and triglyceride level . CONCLUSION : Results of this study suggest that HT is associated with a reduction in urinary albumin excretion in postmenopausal women .
