Novel 3,4-diarylpyrazolines as potent cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonists with lower lipophilicity . Novel 3,4-diarylpyrazolines 1 as potent P21554 receptor antagonists with lipophilicity lower than that of DB05077 are described . The key change is the replacement of the arylsulfonyl group in the original series by a dialkylaminosulfonyl moiety . The absolute configuration ( 4S ) of eutomer 24 was established by X-ray diffraction analysis and 24 showed a close molecular fit with rimonabant in a P21554 receptor-based model . Compound 17 exhibited the highest P21554 receptor affinity ( Ki = 24 nM ) in this series , as well as very potent P21554 antagonistic activity ( pA2 = 8.8 ) and a high P21554 /CB2 subtype selectivity ( approximately 147-fold ) .
