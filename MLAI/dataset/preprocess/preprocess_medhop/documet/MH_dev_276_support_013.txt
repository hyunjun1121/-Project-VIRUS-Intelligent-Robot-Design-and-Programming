Investigation of cholecystokinin system genes in panic disorder . There is evidence for the role of the cholecystokinin ( CCK ) neurotransmitter system in the neurobiology of panic disorder ( PD ) . The CCK receptor agonist , CCK-tetrapeptide ( Q13308 ) fulfills criteria for a panicogenic agent and there is evidence that PD might be associated with an abnormal function of the CCK system . For example , PD patients show an enhanced sensitivity to Q13308 , and exhibit lower P04141 and lymphocyte CCK concentration as compared to healthy controls ( reviewed by Bradwejn et al. ) . Also , untreated PD patients display an increased Q13308 -induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in T cells relative to treated PD , depression and schizophrenia . The CCK receptors have been classified into two subtypes : CCK-A and CCK-B . We report here a study of polymorphisms in the CCK pre-pro hormone gene ( CCK ) , P32238 , and P32239 in DSM-IV panic patients ( n = 99 ) vs controls matched for gender and ethnicity . The CCK polymorphism revealed no association with PD . We identified a new polymorphism for the P32238 gene , and tested it in our sample , with negative results . A single nucleotide polymorphism has been found in the coding region of the P32239 gene ( P32239 ) and D Collier ( personal communication ) identified a highly polymorphic dinucleotide (CT)n microsatellite in the 5' regulatory region . For the P32239 gene polymorphism , PD patients showed a significant association . Our genetic dissection of the CCK system thus far suggests that the P32239 gene variation may contribute to the neurobiology of panic disorder .
