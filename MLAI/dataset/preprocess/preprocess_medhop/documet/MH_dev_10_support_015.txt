DB00072 emtansine : the first targeted chemotherapy for treatment of breast cancer . DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate , comprised of a potent cytotoxic drug connected via a stable linker to the anti- P04626 antibody , trastuzumab , thereby primarily targeting chemotherapy delivery to cells overexpressing the P04626 receptor . A Phase II randomized trial of DB05773 in the front-line metastatic breast cancer setting revealed promising activity and improved safety compared with standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab . Subsequently , a Phase III trial in patients with trastuzumab-pretreated metastatic breast cancer showed DB05773 to be associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine . DB05773 represents a major shift in the treatment of patients with breast cancer as it replaces traditional nontargeted chemotherapy with a ' smart ' medication that directs the cytotoxic therapy to cancer cells by using a known biomarker .
