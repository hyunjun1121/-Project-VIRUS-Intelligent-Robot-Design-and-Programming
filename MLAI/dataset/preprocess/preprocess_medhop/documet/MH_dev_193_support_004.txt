Inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 normalizes vascular endothelial function in type 2 diabetic mice by improving β-arrestin 2 translocation and ameliorating Akt/ P29474 signal dysfunction . In type 2 diabetes , although Akt/endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) activation is known to be negatively regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ( P25098 ) , it is unclear whether the P25098 inhibitor would have therapeutic effects . Here we examined the hypotensive effect of the P25098 inhibitor and its efficacy agonist both vascular ( aortic ) endothelial dysfunction ( focusing especially on the Akt/ P29474 pathway ) and glucose intolerance in two type 2 diabetic models ( ob/ob mice and nicotinamide+streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice ) . Mice were treated with a single injection of the P25098 inhibitor or vehicle , and the therapeutic effects were compared by examining vascular function and by Western blotting . The P25098 inhibitor lowered blood pressure in both diabetic models but not in their age-matched controls . The P25098 inhibitor significantly improved clonidine-induced relaxation only in diabetic ( ob/ob and DM ) mice , with accompanying attenuations of P25098 activity and translocation to the plasma membrane . These protective effects of the P25098 inhibitor may be attributable to the augmented Akt/ P29474 pathway activation ( as evidenced by increases in Akt phosphorylation at DB00133 (473) and at DB00156 (308) , and P29474 phosphorylation at DB00133 (1177) ) and to the prevention of the P25098 translocation and promotion of β-arrestin 2 translocation to the membrane under clonidine stimulation . Moreover , the P25098 inhibitor significantly improved the glucose intolerance seen in the ob/ob mice . Our work provides the first evidence that in diabetes , the P25098 inhibitor ameliorates vascular endothelial dysfunction via the Akt/ P29474 pathway by inhibiting P25098 activity and enhancing β-arrestin 2 translocation under clonidine stimulation , thereby contributing to a blood pressure-lowering effect . We propose that the P25098 inhibitor may be a promising therapeutic agent for cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes .
