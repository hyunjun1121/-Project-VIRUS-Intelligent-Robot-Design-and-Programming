Current situation of DB01269 , DB05101 , Nimotuzumab and Zalutumumab . P00533 overexpression usually correlates with a more advanced disease stage , a poorer prognosis and a worse chemotherapy response . P00533 expression increase has been observed in many tumours . For all the aforementioned reasons , P00533 inhibition can be considered an attractive approach in cancer treatment . One strategy has been receptor inhibition of extracellular domain using monoclonal antibodies . Cetuximab is the most developed one and there is plenty information on the literature about its current status . In this review we focus on other P00533 monoclonal antibodies under clinical development . The more developed one is DB01269 . Its clinical development is taking place very quickly and it has mainly been studied in colorectal cancer showing promising results . There are also other interesting drugs such as DB05101 , Nimotuzumab and Zalutumumab .
