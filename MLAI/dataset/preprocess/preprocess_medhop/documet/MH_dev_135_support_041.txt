Genetic variants and multiple myeloma risk : IMMEnSE validation of the best reported associations -- an extensive replication of the associations from the candidate gene era . BACKGROUND : Genetic background plays a role in multiple myeloma susceptibility . Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) associated with genetic susceptibility to multiple myeloma were identified in the last years , but only a few of them were validated in independent studies . METHODS : With the aim to conclusively validate the strongest associations so far reported , we selected the polymorphisms rs2227667 ( P05121 ) , rs17501108 ( P14210 ) , rs3136685 ( P32248 ) , rs16944 ( P01584 ) , rs12147254 ( Q13114 ) , rs1805087 ( Q99707 ) , rs1800629 ( P01375 -Î± ) , rs7516435 ( P55211 ) , rs1042265 ( Q07812 ) , rs2234922 ( mEH ) , and rs1801133 ( P42898 ) . We genotyped them in 1,498 multiple myeloma cases and 1,934 controls ascertained in the context of the International Multiple Myeloma rESEarch ( IMMEnSE ) consortium , and meta-analyzed our results with previously published ones . RESULTS : None of the selected SNPs were significantly associated with multiple myeloma risk ( P value range , 0.055-0.981 ) , possibly with the exception of the SNP rs2227667 ( P05121 ) in women . CONCLUSIONS : We can exclude that the selected polymorphisms are major multiple myeloma risk factors . Q9P2X3 : Independent validation studies are crucial to identify true genetic risk factors . Our large-scale study clarifies the role of previously published polymorphisms in multiple myeloma risk .
