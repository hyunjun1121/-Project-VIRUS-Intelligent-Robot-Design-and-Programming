Polarization of ILC2s in peripheral blood might contribute to immunosuppressive microenvironment in patients with gastric cancer . Newly identified nuocytes or group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) play an important role in Th2 cell mediated immunity such as protective immune responses to helminth parasites , allergic asthma , and chronic rhinosinusitis . However , the contributions of ILC2s in the occurrence and development of cancer remain unknown . Our previous study found that there was a predominant Th2 phenotype in patients with gastric cancer . In this study , the ILC2s related genes or molecules in PBMC from patients with gastric cancer were measured , and the potential correlation between them was analyzed . The expression levels of RORα , P23771 , T1/ST2 , Q9NRM6 , Q9Y5Y4 , O95760 , P05113 , and P05112 mRNA were significantly increased in patients , but no significant changes were found in Q9Y6W8 , P08575 , and P35225 expression , and there was a positive correlation between RORα or P35225 and other related factors , such as Q9Y6W8 and P08575 . The increased frequency of ILC2s was also found in PBMC of patients by flow cytometry . In addition , the mRNA of Arg1 and P35228 were also significantly increased in patients . These results suggested that there are polarized ILC2s in gastric cancer patients which might contribute to immunosuppressive microenvironment and closely related to the upregulation of MDSCs and M2 macrophages .
