HIV protease substrate conformation : modulation by cyclophilin A . P62937 ( CyPA ) , a cytosolic peptidyl-prolyl trans-cis isomerase can accelerate the trans-cis isomerization of Xxx-Pro peptide bonds . One- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy were used to determine that the heptapeptide DB00133 -Gln- DB00174 - DB00135 -Pro- DB00167 - DB00161 , a model peptide of an HIV-1 protease cleavage site in the gag polyprotein of HIV-1 , is a substrate for CyPA . Experiments revealed a slow exchange about the DB00135 -Pro peptide bond with 30 +/- 5 % in the cis conformation ( pH 1-9 ) . While the interconversion rate is too slow to measure by kinetic NMR methods in the absence of CyPA , these methods , saturation transfer and NOE experiments , established that CyPA enhanced the rate of trans-cis interconversion , a process inhibited by cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) . With a substrate:CyPA ratio of 40:1 , an interconversion rate of 2.5 s(-1) at 25 degrees C was observed .
