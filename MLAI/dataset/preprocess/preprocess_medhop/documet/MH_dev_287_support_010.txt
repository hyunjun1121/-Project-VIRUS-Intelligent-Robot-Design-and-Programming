Integrin alpha5-induced P00533 activation by prothrombin triggers hepatocyte apoptosis via the JNK signaling pathway . We have previously shown that prothrombin , a blood coagulation factor , can cause an inhibition of DNA synthesis in normal rat hepatocytes . To explore the mechanisms of this prothrombin action , we examined its effects on the activation of fibronectin receptor integrin alpha5 , since fibronectin was found to be degraded by prothrombin actions in primary hepatocyte cultures . We found that prothrombin treatment of rat hepatocytes without addition of any growth factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin alpha5 and interaction of integrin alpha5 with epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , leading to P00533 tyrosine phosphorylation at tyrosine residues DB00135 -845 and DB00135 -1173 . P00533 tyrosine phosphorylation triggered phosphorylation of its down-stream target Shc and the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway . P00734 also induced hepatocyte apoptosis , a change in cell shape and activation of caspase 3 pathway . The JNK pathway is most likely involved in prothrombin-induced hepatocyte apoptosis , because pre-treatment of hepatocytes with JNK kinase inhibitor II ( SP600125 ) antagonized these prothrombin actions . The data suggest that integrin-related P00533 activation by prothrombin can induce cell growth inhibition and apoptosis via an P00533 -JNK signaling pathway .
