Evidence for colorectal cancer cell specificity of aspirin effects on NF kappa B signalling and apoptosis . Epidemiological evidence indicates that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) protect against colorectal cancer ( CRC ) to a greater degree than other non-gastrointestinal cancers , but the molecular basis for this difference is unknown . We previously reported that aspirin induces signal-specific I kappa B alpha degradation followed by NF kappa B nuclear translocation in CRC cells , and that this mechanism contributes substantially to aspirin-induced apoptosis . Here , we explored the hypothesis that cell-type specific effects on NF kappa B signalling are responsible for the observed differences in protection by aspirin against CRC compared to breast and gynaecological cancers . We also assessed whether P35354 expression , mutation status of adenomatous polyposis coli ( P25054 ) , beta-catenin , p53 , or DNA mismatch repair ( P22897 ) genes in CRC lines influenced aspirin-induced effects . We found that aspirin induced concentration-dependent I kappa B alpha degradation , NF kappa B nuclear translocation and apoptosis in all CRC lines studied . However , there was no such effect on the other cancer cell types , indicating a considerable degree of cell-type specificity . The lack of effect on NF kappa B signalling , paralleled by absence of an apoptotic response to aspirin in non-CRC lines , strongly suggests a molecular rationale for the particular protective effect of NSAIDs against CRC . Effects on NF kappa B and apoptosis were observed irrespective of P35354 expression , or mutation status in P25054 , beta-catenin , p53 and DNA P22897 genes , underscoring the generality of the aspirin effect on NF kappa B in CRC cells . These findings raise the possibility of cell-type specific targets for the development of novel chemopreventive agents .
