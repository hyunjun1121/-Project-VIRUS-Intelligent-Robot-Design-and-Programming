Novel inhibitors of P15692 receptors-1 and -2 based on azole-5-carboxamide templates . We have developed a series of novel potent 1-(2-(pyridin-4-yl)ethyl)-1H-azole-5-carboxamides active against kinases P35968 and -1 . Both specific and dual DB00171 -competitive inhibitors of P35968 were identified . Kinase selectivity could be controlled by varying the 5-carboxamide substituent at the azole ring . The most specific molecules displayed > 10-fold selectivity for P35968 over P17948 . Compound activities in vitro and in cell-based assays ( IC(50) < 100 nM ) were similar to those of reported clinical and development candidates , including PTK787 ( DB04879 (trade) ) and DB05294 ( DB05294 ( trade mark ) ) . High permeability of active compounds across the Caco-2 cell monolayer ( > 40 x 10(-5)cm/min ) is indicative of their potential for intestinal absorption upon oral administration .
