Control of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism by phosphorylation mechanisms . A system for the parallel determination of enzyme phosphorylation and expressed activity in rat liver cells , and its application to studies of phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine aminotransferase , is described . DB00120 hydroxylase is phosphorylated by agents which stimulate cyclic AMP- and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activity . The phosphorylation site(s) appear to be the same for both kinases . Phosphorylation is accompanied by increased metabolic flux at low , physiologically relevant , substrate concentrations . P01308 and spermine both inhibit the phosphorylation of the enzyme , possibly by increasing dephosphorylation . P17735 is phosphorylated in liver cell incubations but the rate is slow and insensitive to additions to the medium . No parallel changes in flux could be detected . Both enzymes are subject to complex regulatory mechanisms , short- and long-term . Their activities may be coordinated in vivo by control exerted at the level of the plasma membrane where both amino acids share the same transport processes . Determination of the control coefficients for the several components indicates that membrane transport may be a major limitation on flux .
