Effects of lurasidone on executive function in common marmosets . Cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms of schizophrenia , and is considered largely due to dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) . DB08815 , a novel atypical antipsychotic agent with high binding affinity for dopamine D2 , serotonin P34969 , 5- Q13049 and P08908 receptors has been reported to have superior efficacy in rodents ' models of cognitive impairment . However , the beneficial effect of lurasidone on cognitive impairment has not been evaluated in non-human primates . In this study , we investigated the effect of lurasidone on executive function , which is one of the cognitive domains , in common marmosets and compared the results to those of other antipsychotics . The effects of lurasidone , haloperidol , olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine and clozapine on executive function were evaluated in na√Øve marmosets using the object retrieval with detours ( ORD ) task . Before drug treatment , marmosets ' success rates in the easy trial of the test were almost 90 % . However , maximum success in the difficult trial of the task reached only 50 % after 8 days of training . DB00502 , olanzapine and risperidone decreased correct performance even in the easy trial of the task . All drugs , except lurasidone , impaired success rate in the difficult trial . On the other hand , lurasidone dose-dependently increased marmosets ' success rates in the difficult trial with significant effect at 10mg/kg . In conclusion , we have shown in this study that lurasidone , unlike conventional antipsychotics , improves cognition associated with executive function in common marmosets . These findings suggest that lurasidone would be more useful for treatment of schizophrenia cognitive impairment than other antipsychotics .
