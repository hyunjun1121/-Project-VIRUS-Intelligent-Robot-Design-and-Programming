Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor cilomilast inhibits fibroblast-mediated collagen gel degradation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and neutrophil elastase . Tissue destruction , resulting in emphysema , can be a consequence of several pathologic processes . The current study evaluated the effects of the phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitor , cilomilast , and other PDE inhibitors on the ability of fibroblasts to degrade extracellular matrix . Using the three-dimensional collagen gel culture system , fibroblasts ( HFL-1 ) were cultured with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , known to induce matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) release , and/or neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , which can induce MMP activation . On Day 4 , gels containing P01375 and NE were significantly degraded ( 20.8 +/- 2.9 % of original collagen content ) . DB03849 ( 10 micro M ) inhibited this degradation ( 84.4 +/- 8.4 % ) . DB01427 , a PDE3 inhibitor , and zaprinast , a O76074 inhibitor , had no effect . Gelatin zymography and immunoblotting revealed that fibroblasts cultured with P01375 released increased amounts of latent P03956 and -9 . The addition of NE resulted in the conversion of P03956 and -9 to their active forms , indicative of collagen degradation . DB03849 inhibited the release of P03956 and -9 , as well as conversion of P03956 to its active form . Using real-time PCR analysis , cilomilast 's effect on P03956 release was not associated with the proteinase 's mRNA expression , suggesting that the inhibition of release is regulated at the post-transcriptional level . These results suggest that cilomilast may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent in diseases characterized by excessive tissue destruction , such as emphysema .
