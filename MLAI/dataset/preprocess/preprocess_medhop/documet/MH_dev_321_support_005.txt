Regulation of hepatic lecithin:retinol acyltransferase activity by retinoic acid receptor-selective retinoids . The microsomal enzyme O95237 esterifies retinol and has been implicated in the hepatic storage of vitamin A . Previously , we showed that hepatic O95237 activity is negligible during vitamin A deficiency and that all-trans-retinoic acid ( all-trans-RA ) rapidly induces the activity of liver O95237 in retinoid-deficient rats . In the present studies , we have examined the ability of natural and synthetic retinoids to induce liver O95237 activity in retinoid-deficient rats . The natural retinoids retinol , all-trans-RA ( 100 microg ) , 9- DB00982 , or equal molar amounts of other retinoids were injected ip and O95237 specific activity was measured in liver homogenates 17-18 h later . In retinoid-deficient rats , liver O95237 activity was extremely low [ 0.13 +/- 0.03 pmol retinyl ester ( RE ) /min/mg liver protein , mean +/- SE ] . The natural retinoids retinol and all-trans-RA strongly induced O95237 activity ( 12.71 +/- 1.09 and 13.10 +/- 1.55 pmol RE/min/mg , respectively ) , whereas 9- DB00982 induced a lower level of O95237 activity ( 3.96 +/- 1.88 pmol RE/min/mg , P < 0.001 vs all-trans-RA ) . The retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -selective analog ( RAR pan-agonist ) all-trans-UAB8 and the P10276 -selective retinoid Am580 also strongly induced O95237 activity . In contrast , neither RXR-selective agonists nor retinoids having a retro structure were active . For retinoids with significant P10276 binding activity there was a strong direct correlation between receptor binding in vitro and the ability to induce hepatic O95237 activity in vivo ( r2 = 0.920 ) . These data implicate the RARs in the induction of hepatic O95237 and suggest a predominant role for P10276 -active ligands .
