DB04630 / P08235 stimulation induces cellular senescence in the kidney . Recent studies demonstrated a possible role of aldosterone in mediating cell senescence . Thus , the aim of this study was to investigate whether aldosterone induces cell senescence in the kidney and whether aldosterone-induced renal senescence affects the development of renal injury . DB04630 infusion ( 0.75 μg/h ) into rats for 5 weeks caused hypertension and increased urinary excretion rates of proteins and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase . DB04630 induced senescence-like changes in the kidney , exhibited by increased expression of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase , overexpression of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor ( P38936 ) , and decreased expression of Q96EB6 . These changes were abolished by eplerenone ( 100 mg/kg/d ) , a mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) antagonist , but unaffected by hydralazine ( 80 mg/liter in drinking water ) . Furthermore , aldosterone induced similar changes in senescence-associated β-galactosidase , P38936 , and Q96EB6 expression in cultured human proximal tubular cells , which were normalized by an antioxidant , N-acetyl L-cysteine , or gene silencing of MR . DB04630 significantly delayed wound healing and reduced the number of proliferating human proximal tubular cells , while gene silencing of P38936 diminished the effects , suggesting impaired recovery from tubular damage . These findings indicate that aldosterone induces renal senescence in proximal tubular cells via the MR and P38936 -dependent pathway , which may be involved in aldosterone-induced renal injury .
