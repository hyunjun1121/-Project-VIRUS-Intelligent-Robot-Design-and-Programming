Covariates of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) from healthy humans . BACKGROUND : Define covariates of cerebrospinal corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) levels in normal humans . CRHCSF was measured in 9 normal subjects as part of an intensive study of physiological responses stressors in chronic pain and fatigue states . CRHCSF was first correlated with demographic , vital sign , Q9Y251 axis , validated questionnaire domains , baseline and maximal responses to pain , exercise and other stressors . Significant factors were used for linear regression modeling . RESULTS : Highly significant correlations were found despite the small number of subjects . Three models were defined : ( a ) CRHCSF with blood glucose and sodium ( explained variance = 0.979 , adjusted R2 = 0.958 , p = 0.02 by 2-tailed testing ) ; ( b ) CRHCSF with resting respiratory and heart rates ( R2 = 0.963 , adjusted R2 = 0.939 , p = 0.007 ) ; and ( c ) CRHCSF with SF-36 Vitality and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory Physical Fatigue domains ( R2 = 0.859 , adjusted R2 = 0.789 , p = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Low CRHCSF was predicted by lower glucose , respiratory and heart rates , and higher sodium and psychometric constructs of well being . Responses at peak exercise and to other acute stressors were not correlated . CRHCSF may have reflected an overall , or chronic , set-point for physiological responses , but did not predict the reserves available to respond to immediate stressors .
