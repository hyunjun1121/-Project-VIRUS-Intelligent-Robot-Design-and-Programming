Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel macrocyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimides as potent and highly selective glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta ( P49841 ) inhibitors . Palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions were used to synthesize two key intermediates 3 and 5 that resulted in the synthesis of novel series of macrocyclic bis-7-azaindolylmaleimides . Among the three series of macrocycles , the oxygen atom and thiophene containing linkers yielded molecules with higher inhibitory potency at P49841 ( K(i)=0.011-0.079 microM ) while the nitrogen atom containing linkers yielded molecules with lower potency ( K(i)=0.150- > 1 microM ) . Compound 33 and 36 displayed 1-2 orders of magnitude selectivity at P49841 against P24941 , PKC beta II , Rsk3 and little or no inhibitions to the other 62 protein kinases . Compound 46 was at least 100-fold more selective towards P49841 than PKC beta II , and it had little or no activity against a panel of 65 protein kinases , almost behaved as a P49841 ' specific inhibitor ' . All three compounds showed good potency in GS assay . Molecular docking studies were conducted in an attempt to rationalize the P49841 selectivity of azaindolylmaleimides . The high selectivity , inhibitory potency and cellular activities of these non-crown-ether typed molecules may provide them as a valuable pharmacological tools in elucidating the complex roles of P49841 in cell signaling pathways and the potential usage for the treatment of elevated level of P49841 involved diseases .
