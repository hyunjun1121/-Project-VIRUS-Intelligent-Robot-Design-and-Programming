Endothelial permeability in vitro and in vivo : protective actions of P01160 and omapatrilat in experimental atherosclerosis . Increased arterial endothelial cell permeability ( P12724 ) is considered an initial step in atherosclerosis . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) which is rapidly degraded by neprilysin ( NEP ) may reduce injury-induced endothelial cell leakiness . DB00886 represents a first in class of pharmacological agents which inhibits both NEP and angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) . We hypothesized that P01160 prevents thrombin-induced increases of P12724 in human aortic ECs ( HAECs ) and that omapatrilat would reduce aortic leakiness and atherogenesis and enhance P01160 mediated vasorelaxation of isolated aortas . Thrombin induced P12724 determined by I(125) albumin flux was assessed in HAECs with and without P01160 pretreatment . Next we examined the effects of chronic oral administration of omapatrilat ( 12 mg/kg/day , n=13 ) or placebo ( n=13 ) for 8 weeks on aortic leakiness , atherogenesis and P01160 -mediated vasorelaxation in isolated aortas in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis produced by high cholesterol diet . In HAECs , thrombin-induced increases in P12724 were prevented by P01160 . DB00886 reduced the area of increased aortic leakiness determined by Evans-blue dye and area of atheroma formation assessed by Oil-Red staining compared to placebo . In isolated arterial rings , omapatrilat enhanced vasorelaxation to P01160 compared to placebo with and without the endothelium . P01160 prevents thrombin-induced increases in P12724 in HAECs . Chronic oral administration of omapatrilat reduces aortic leakiness and atheroma formation with enhanced endothelial independent vasorelaxation to P01160 . These studies support the therapeutic potential of dual inhibition of NEP and P12821 in the prevention of increased arterial P12724 and atherogenesis which may be linked to the P01160 /cGMP system .
