Identification and characterization of mouse Erbb2 gene in silico . The Q9UD71 - Q14849 - O15273 -PNMT-MGC9753- P04626 -MGC14832- Q14451 locus on human chromosome 17q12 is frequently amplified in human gastric and breast cancer . We have recently identified and characterized human MGC9753 ( also known as wild-type CAB2 ) and mouse Mgc9753 . Here , we identified and characterized mouse Erbb2 gene by using bioinformatics . BLAST programs revealed that mouse AK031099 cDNA was derived from mouse Erbb2 gene . Because AK031099 cDNA showed 806 C --> A nucleotide substitution compared with mouse genome draft sequences and mouse Erbb2 ESTs , the nucleotide sequence of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was determined in silico by correcting 806 A of AK031099 cDNA to C . Nucleotide position 48-3818 of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was the coding region . Mouse Erbb2 gene , consisting of 27 exons , was located within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus on the mouse chromosome 11 . Mouse Erbb2 protein ( 1256 aa ) showed 87.5 % total-amino-acid identity with human P04626 protein , and 95.2 % total-amino-acid identity with rat Erbb2 protein . Mouse Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus and human Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were evolutionarily conserved in the order and the orientation of genes therein . Nucleotide and amino-acid substitution rates of Neurod2 located centromeric to the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were significantly lower than others within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus . This is the first report on the complete coding sequence of mouse Erbb2 gene as well as on the comprehensive comparison of Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus within the human and mouse genomes .
