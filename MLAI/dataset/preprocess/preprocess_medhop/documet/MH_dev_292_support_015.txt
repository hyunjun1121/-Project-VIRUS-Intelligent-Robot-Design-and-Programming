Expression of angiotensin I-converting enzymes and bradykinin B2 receptors in mouse inner medullary-collecting duct cells . We described in mouse inner medullary-collecting duct cells ( mIMCD-3 ) the somatic and the N-domain P12821 synthesis and its interaction with the kallikrein-kinin system co-localized in the same cells . We purified two P12821 forms from culture medium , M1 ( 130 kDa ) and M2 ( N-domain , 60 kDa ) , and cellular lysate , C1 ( 130 kDa ) and P06681 ( N-domain , 60 kDa ) . DB01197 and enalaprilat inhibited the purified enzymes . The immunofluorescence studies indicated that P12821 is present in the membrane , cytoplasm and in the cell nucleus . Kinin B1 and B2 receptors were detected by immunofluorescence and showed to be activated by BK and DesR9 BK , increasing the acidification rate which was enhanced in the presence of enalaprilat . The presence of secreted and intracellular P12821 in mIMCD-3 confirmed the hypothesis previously proposed by our group for a new site of P12821 secretion in the collecting duct .
