Bcr-Abl activates O14965 and Q96GD4 in chronic myeloid leukemia cells via AKT signaling . This study explored molecular mechanisms by which Bcr-Abl induced expression of O14965 and B ( O14965 and Q96GD4 ) in chronic myeloid leukemia cells . Lentiviral transduction of Bcr-Abl into either Ba/ P13726 or P28906 (+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells potently increased levels of O14965 and Q96GD4 in association with phosphorylation of AKT and stimulated their proliferation . Bcr-Abl-mediated expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 were decreased in P28906 (+) HSPCs when AKT was inactivated by an shRNA against AKT , suggesting that Bcr-Abl induced expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 via AKT signaling . DB05220 , an inhibitor of O14965 , significantly inhibited the proliferation of freshly isolated P28906 (+) CML cells in a dose-dependent manner as measured by colony forming assay . Importantly , inhibition of O14965 in P28906 (+) leukemia cells freshly isolated from individuals with blast crisis of CML with Bcr-Abl T315I mutant ( n = 2 ) by DB05220 significantly impaired the engraftment of these cells in severely immunocompromised mice and decreased the weight of spleens . Taken together , Bcr-Abl induces expression of O14965 and Q96GD4 at least in part via AKT . Inhibition of O14965 could be useful to overcome imatinib-resistance mediated by Bcr-Abl mutants .
