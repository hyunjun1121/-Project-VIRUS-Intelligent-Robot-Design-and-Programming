Role of chronic inhibition of dopamine-metabolizing enzymes in the regulation of renal sodium and phosphate excretion in the rat remnant kidney . BACKGROUND/AIMS : The present study examined the effects of chronic selective or combined inhibition of type A monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) and catechol-O-methyltransferase ( P21964 ) on daily urinary excretion of dopamine and metabolites and on natriuresis and phosphaturia in 3/4 nephrectomized ( 3/4nx ) and Sham rats . METHODS : The 3/4nx and Sham rats were placed in metabolic cages and received the P21397 -selective inhibitor Ro-411049 ( 7.5 mg x kg(-1) bid ) and/or the P21964 -selective inhibitor DB03336 3-202 ( 30 mg x kg(-1) bid ) orally for 3 days during high sodium diet . RESULTS : Selective P21964 inhibition increased the urinary excretion of the deaminated metabolite ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid , DOPAC ) and decreased the urinary excretion of the methylated ( 3-methoxytyramine , 3-MT ) and deaminated plus methylated metabolite ( homovanillic acid , HVA ) in both groups . Selective P21397 inhibition increased the urinary excretion of 3-MT and reduced the urinary excretion of both DOPAC and HVA in either 3/4nx or Sham rats . Combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 did not significantly change the urinary excretion of DOPAC and markedly decreased the urinary excretion of 3-MT and HVA in both groups . Selective or combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 did not alter the daily urinary excretion of dopamine , sodium or phosphate in either 3/4nx or Sham rats . CONCLUSIONS : Chronic selective or combined inhibition of P21397 and P21964 is not of major importance in regulating the dopamine-dependent natriuresis and phosphaturia in either 3/4nx or Sham rats .
