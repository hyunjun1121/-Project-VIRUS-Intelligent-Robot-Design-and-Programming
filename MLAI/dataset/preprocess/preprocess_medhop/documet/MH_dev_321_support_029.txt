Q14954 -positive NK cells mediate alloresponse against the P06681 HLA- P55040 ligand group in vitro . The inhibitory 2DL1 and activating 2DS1 killer Ig-like receptors ( P55040 ) both have shared ligand specificity for codon sequences in the P06681 group HLA-Cw Ags . In this study , we have investigated NK cell activation by allogeneic target cells expressing different combinations of the HLA- P55040 ligand groups C1 , P06681 , and Bw4 . We demonstrate that fresh NK cells as well as P60568 -propagated NK cells from 2DS1-positive donors that are homozygous for the C1 ligand group are activated in vitro by B lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the P06681 group . This response is , in part , due to the absence of C1 group recognition mediated by the inhibitory receptor 2DL2/3 . This " missing self " alloresponse to P06681 , however , is rarely observed in NK cells from donors lacking 2DS1 . Even in presence of 2DS1 , the NK alloresponse is dramatically reduced in donors that have P06681 group as " self. " Analysis of selected NK clones that express 2DS1 mRNA and lack mRNA for 2DL1 demonstrates that activation by the P06681 ligand and mAb cross-linking of 2DS1 in these clones induces P01579 . Furthermore , this P06681 group-induced activation is inhibited by Abs to both HLA class I and the receptor . Collectively , these studies demonstrate that NK cells from 2DS1-positive donors are activated by target cells that express the P06681 group as an alloantigen . This leads to increased P01579 -positive fresh NK cells and induces NK allocytotoxicity in P60568 -propagated polyclonal NK cells and NK clones . This study also provides support for the concept that incompatibility for the HLA- P55040 ligand groups C1 , P06681 , and Bw4 dominates NK alloactivation in vitro .
