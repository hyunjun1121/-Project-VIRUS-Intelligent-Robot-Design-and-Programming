Phosphodiesterase-4 influences the PKA phosphorylation status and membrane translocation of G-protein receptor kinase 2 ( P25098 ) in P29320 -293beta2 cells and cardiac myocytes . Membrane-recruitment of P25098 ( G-protein receptor kinase 2 ) provides a fundamental step in the desensitization process controlling GPCRs ( G-protein-coupled receptors ) , such as the beta2AR ( beta2-adrenergic receptor ) . In the present paper , we show that challenge of P29320 -293beta2 [ human embryonic kidney cells stably overexpressing the FLAG-tagged beta2AR-GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) ] cells with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist , isoprenaline , causes P25098 to become phosphorylated by PKA ( DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ) . This action is facilitated when DB02527 -specific DB05876 ( phosphodiesterase-4 ) activity is selectively inactivated , either chemically with rolipram or by siRNA ( small interfering RNA ) -mediated knockdown of Q07343 and Q08499 . DB05876 -selective inhibition by rolipram facilitates the isoprenaline-induced membrane translocation of P25098 , phosphorylation of the beta2AR by P25098 , membrane translocation of beta-arrestin and internalization of beta2ARs . DB05876 -selective inhibition also enhances the ability of isoprenaline to trigger the PKA phosphorylation of P25098 in cardiac myocytes . In the absence of isoprenaline , rolipram-induced inhibition of DB05876 activity in P29320 -293beta2 cells acts to stimulate PKA phosphorylation of P25098 , with consequential effects on P25098 membrane recruitment and P25098 -mediated phosphorylation of the beta2AR . We propose that a key role for DB05876 enzymes is : ( i ) to gate the action of PKA on P25098 , influencing the rate of P25098 phosphorylation of the beta2AR and consequential recruitment of beta-arrestin subsequent to beta-adrenoceptor agonist challenge , and ( ii ) to protect P25098 from inappropriate membrane recruitment in unstimulated cells through its phosphorylation by PKA in response to fluctuations in basal levels of DB02527 .
