Regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by ceramide . P12004 -dependent kinases have been implicated in the inactivation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein and cell cycle progression . Recent studies have demonstrated that the lipid molecule ceramide is able to induce Rb hypophosphorylation leading to growth arrest and cellular senescence . In this study , we examined the underlying mechanisms of Rb hypophosphorylation and cell cycle progression utilizing the antiproliferative molecule ceramide . P13671 -Ceramide induced a G0/ P55008 arrest of the cell cycle in WI38 human diploid fibroblasts . Employing immunoprecipitation kinase assays , we found that ceramide specifically inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase P24941 , with a mild effect on P06493 and significantly less effect on P11802 . The effect of ceramide was specific such that P13671 -dihydroceramide was not effective . Ceramide did not directly inhibit P24941 in vitro but caused activation of P38936 , a major class of CDK-inhibitory proteins , and led to a greater association of P38936 to P24941 . Using purified protein phosphatases , we showed that ceramide activated both protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A activities specific for P24941 in vitro . Further , calyculin A and okadaic acid , both potent protein phosphatase inhibitors , together almost completely reversed the effects of ceramide on P24941 inhibition . Taken together , these results demonstrate a dual mechanism by which ceramide inhibits the cell cycle . Ceramide causes an increase in P38936 association with P24941 and through activation of protein phosphatases selectively regulates P24941 . These events may lead to activation of Rb protein and subsequent cell cycle arrest .
