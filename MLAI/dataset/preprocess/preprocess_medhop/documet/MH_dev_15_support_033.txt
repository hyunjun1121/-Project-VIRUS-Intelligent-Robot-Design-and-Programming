Gene transfer of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 protects PC12 cells from injury : involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathways . Gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases may utilize the expression of neurotrophic factors because of their potential to promote survival and regeneration of injured neuronal cells . Increasing numbers of these factors are being considered for gene transfer , but their specificity and efficacy in neuroprotection are greatly variable . The major aims of this study were to carry out gene transfer of various neurotrophic factors and investigate their mechanisms of action as well as their protective effects on the viability of rat pheochromocytoma ( PC12 ) cells . We used glutamate , S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine ( P60880 ) , and staurosporine to induce excitatory damage , oxidative stress , and apoptosis , respectively , because these mechanisms are thought to participate in various disease processes leading to degeneration of cells . We utilized adenovirus vectors for efficient gene transfer of trophic factors ( glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor [ P39905 ] and cardiotrophin-1 [ Q16619 ] ) or calbindin-D28k . We found that P39905 and Q16619 gene transfers were equally effective in saving PC12 cells from injury , but calbindin expression did not show any beneficial effects . P39905 gene transfer was much more efficient in protecting PC12 cells from damage than direct P39905 administration . The protection by P39905 expression against staurosporine was mediated through both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MAPK kinase ; MEK ) pathways , but only the MEK pathway was involved in the protection against P60880 . In contrast , the protective effect of P39905 against glutamate toxicity was independent of these P07949 -dependent signal transduction pathways .
