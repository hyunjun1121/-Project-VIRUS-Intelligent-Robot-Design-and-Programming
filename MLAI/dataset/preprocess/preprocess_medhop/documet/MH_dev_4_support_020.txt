The response of striatal neuropeptide Y and cholinergic neurons to excitatory amino acid agonists . The effect of excitatory amino acid antagonists on antagonist on neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and cholinergic neurons in the striatum of the rat was studied by means of P01303 immunocytochemistry , DB00677 histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , and biochemical determinations of choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) . Intrastriatal infusion of drugs revealed that striatal neurons containing P01303 are more sensitive than cholinergic neurons to the neurotoxic actions of kainic acid ( KA ) , quinolinic acid ( QA ) and L-glutamic acid ( GA ) ; all 3 compounds produced a marked loss of P01303 neurons , but only a moderate decrease in the number of P22303 neurons or P28329 activity . Co-injection experiments showed that the neurotoxicity of QA and GA , but not that of KA , can be antagonized by the specific N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist 3-((+/-)-2-(carboxypiperazine-4-yl))-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ( CPP ) . Destruction of the glutamatergic corticostriatal projection by cerebral decortication protected striatal P01303 and cholinergic neurons against KA neurotoxicity . These results indicate that striatal P01303 and cholinergic neurons receive prominent cortical amino acid afferents , and that the neurotoxic effect of QA and GA on these neurons is mediated through DB01221 receptors .
