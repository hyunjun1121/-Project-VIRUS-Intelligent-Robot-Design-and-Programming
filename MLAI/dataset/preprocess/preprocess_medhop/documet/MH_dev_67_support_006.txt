[ Serotonin transporter gene and stress reactivity in unipolar depression. Role of the Q9Y251 system as endophenotype of the P31645 gene ] . BACKGROUND : A length polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( 5-HTTLPR ) is associated with both depression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) system activity . A dysregulation of the Q9Y251 system is considered to be a candidate endophenotype of depression . The objective of the present study was an investigation of a possible gene-endophenotype-interaction between 5-HTTLPR and Q9Y251 system activity in a sample of inpatients with major depression . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 237 inpatients with major depression were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and participated in a combined dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone test ( DB00514 - P06850 test ) as well as using the Hamilton score ( Hamilton rating scale for depression ) to determine the severity of the psychopathology . RESULTS : Patients with the ss-genotype showed a significantly higher Q9Y251 -system activity in comparison to patients with the lI-genotype , but no association between 5-HTTLPR and the severity of psychopathology could be detected . CONCLUSIONS : The results of the current study demonstrate an influence of 5-HTTLPR on dysregulation of the Q9Y251 system in patients with major depression and support the hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR- and Q9Y251 -system-interaction constitutes an important component in the pathogenesis of depression .
