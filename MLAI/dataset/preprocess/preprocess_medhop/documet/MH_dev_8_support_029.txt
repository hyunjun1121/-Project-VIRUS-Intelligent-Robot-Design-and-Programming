A mechanism-based model for the population pharmacokinetics of free and bound aflibercept in healthy subjects . AIM : DB08885 ( P15692 - Q8NHU6 ) , a novel anti-angiogenic agent that binds to P15692 , has been investigated for the treatment of cancer . The aim of this study was to develop a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model for aflibercept to characterize its binding to P15692 and its PK properties in healthy subjects . METHODS : Data from two phase I clinical studies with aflibercept administered as a single intravenous infusion were included in the analysis . Free and bound aflibercept concentration-time data were analysed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach with MONOLIX 3.1 . RESULTS : The best structural model involved two compartments for free aflibercept and one for bound aflibercept , with a Michaelis-Menten type binding of free aflibercept to P15692 from the peripheral compartment . The typical estimated clearances for free and bound aflibercept were 0.88 l day(-1) and 0.14 l day(-1) , respectively . The central volume of distribution of free aflibercept was 4.94 l . The maximum binding capacity was 0.99 mg day(-1) and the concentration of aflibercept corresponding to half of maximum binding capacity was 2.91 Âµg ml(-1) . Interindividual variability of model parameters was moderate , ranging from 13.6 % ( V(max) ) to 49.8 % ( Q ) . CONCLUSION : The present PK model for aflibercept adequately characterizes the underlying mechanism of disposition of aflibercept and its nonlinear binding to P15692 .
