The ratio of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity to the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 protein in diabetes : adding insult to injury . BACKGROUND : This study was performed to delineate the relationship between plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) activity and P05121 protein to characterize the functional importance of elevated P05121 in diabetes . METHODS : P05121 activity ( chromogenic substrate kinetic assay ) and protein ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) were assayed in baseline central venous catheter-acquired samples from 170 patients with type 2 diabetes studied in the DB00197 Atherosclerosis Regression Trial ( TART ) . RESULTS : The data demonstrated that the ratio of P05121 activity to the concentration of P05121 protein is increased as a function of increasing concentrations of P05121 protein in blood . CONCLUSIONS : The results demonstrate that the ratio of P05121 activity to the concentration of P05121 protein is higher when the concentration of P05121 is elevated . The nonlinearity appears to depend on the fact that the rate of disappearance of P05121 activity in blood is a function of the concentration of P05121 protein .
