Signaling by proinflammatory cytokines : oligomerization of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 is sufficient for JNK and IKK activation and target gene induction via an amino-terminal effector domain . Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) stimulate transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB through activation of the Q96HU1 kinases JNK and p38 and the O15111 ( IKK ) , respectively . The P01375 and IL-1 signals are transduced through TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 , respectively . Overexpressed TRAF2 or Q9Y4K3 activate JNK , p38 , or IKK in the absence of extracellular stimulation . By replacing the carboxy-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 with repeats of the immunophilin P62942 , we demonstrate that their effector domains are composed of their amino-terminal Zn and RING fingers . Oligomerization of the TRAF2 effector domain results in specific binding to Q13233 , a protein kinase capable of JNK , p38 , and IKK activation , and induction of P01375 and IL-1 responsive genes . P01375 also enhances the binding of native TRAF2 to Q13233 and stimulates the kinase activity of the latter . Thus , P01375 and IL-1 signaling is based on oligomerization of TRAF2 and Q9Y4K3 leading to activation of effector kinases .
