Rikkunshito , a Kampo medicine , ameliorates post-operative ileus by anti-inflammatory action . Rikkunshito ( RKT ) , a Kampo ( Japanese herbal ) medicine , is used as a prokinetic for patients with various diseases including functional dyspepsia . RKT promotes delayed gastric emptying via 5- Q9H205 receptor blockade . Otherwise , RKT increases ghrelin release via P41595 and P28335 receptor activation . Recent studies revealed that ghrelin and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonists have an anti-inflammatory effect . So we hypothesize that RKT may have an anti-inflammatory action in the post-operative ileus . Intestinal manipulation ( IM ) was applied to the distal ileum of mice . RKT was administered orally 4 times before and after IM . Gastrointestinal transit in vivo , leukocyte infiltration , and gastric emptying were analyzed . We also investigated the effects of the 5- Q9H205 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguamide ( mCPBG ) and ghrelin-receptor antagonist [ D-Lys3 ] - Q92847 -6 on the ameliorative action of RKT . RKT treatment led to recovery of the delayed intestinal transit and gastric emptying rate induced by IM . RKT significantly inhibited the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages . [ D-Lys3 ] - Q92847 -6 reduced and mCPBG partially reduced the RKT-mediated anti-inflammatory activity , as monitored by infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils . RKT serves as a novel therapeutic agent for POI characterized by its anti-inflammatory potency , in addition to prokinetic action . The RKT-induced anti-inflammatory activity may be partly mediated by inhibition of the 5- Q9H205 receptor and ghrelin release .
