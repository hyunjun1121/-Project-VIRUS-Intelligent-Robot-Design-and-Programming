Characterization of the StcE protease activity of Escherichia coli O157:H7 . The StcE zinc metalloprotease is secreted by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) O157:H7 and contributes to intimate adherence of this bacterium to host cells , a process essential for mammalian colonization . StcE has also been shown to localize the inflammatory regulator P05155 ( DB05341 ) to cell membranes . We tried to more fully characterize StcE activity to better understand its role in EHEC pathogenesis . StcE was active at pH 6.1 to 9.0 , in the presence of NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 600 mM , and at 4 degrees C to 55 degrees C . Interestingly , antisera against StcE or DB05341 did not eliminate StcE cleavage of DB05341 . Treatment of StcE with the proteases trypsin , chymotrypsin , human neutrophil elastase , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase did not eliminate StcE activity against DB05341 . After StcE was kept at 23 degrees C for 65 days , it exhibited full proteolytic activity , and it retained 30 % of its original activity after incubation for 8 days at 37 degrees C . Together , these results show the StcE protease is a stable enzyme that is probably active in the environment of the colon . Additionally , k(cat)/K(m) data showed that StcE proteolytic activity was 2.5-fold more efficient with the secreted mucin Q8TAX7 than with the complement regulator DB05341 . This evidence supports a model which includes two roles for StcE during infection , in which StcE acts first as a mucinase and then as an anti-inflammatory agent by localizing DB05341 to cell membranes .
