Structural bioinformatics-based identification of P00533 inhibitor gefitinib as a putative lead compound for P56817 . Î²-secretase ( P56817 -1 ) is a potential target for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Despite its potential , only few compounds targeting P56817 have entered the clinical trials . Herein , we describe the identification of Gefitinib as a potential lead compound for P56817 through an integrated approach of structural bioinformatics analysis , experimental assessment and computational analysis . In particular , we performed ELISA and western analysis to assess the effect of Gefitinib using N2a human APP695 cells . In addition , we investigated the binding mechanism of Gefitinib with P56817 through molecular docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulations . The computational analyses revealed that hydrophobic contact is a major contributing factor to the binding of Gefitinib with P56817 . The results obtained in the study have rendered Gefitinib as a putative lead compound for P56817 . Further optimization studies are warranted to improve its potency and pharmacological properties against P56817 for potential AD treatment .
