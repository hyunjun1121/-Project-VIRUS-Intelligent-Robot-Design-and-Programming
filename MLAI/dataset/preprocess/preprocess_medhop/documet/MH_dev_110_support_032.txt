Distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system . P21554 cannabinoid receptors appear to mediate most , if not all of the psychoactive effects of DB00470 and related compounds . This G protein-coupled receptor has a characteristic distribution in the nervous system : It is particularly enriched in cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , basal ganglia outflow tracts , and cerebellum -- a distribution that corresponds to the most prominent behavioral effects of cannabis . In addition , this distribution helps to predict neurological and psychological maladies for which manipulation of the endocannabinoid system might be beneficial . P21554 receptors are primarily expressed on neurons , where most of the receptors are found on axons and synaptic terminals , emphasizing the important role of this receptor in modulating neurotransmission at specific synapses . While our knowledge of P21554 localization in the nervous system has advanced tremendously over the past 15 years , there is still more to learn . Particularly pressing is the need for ( 1 ) detailed anatomical studies of brain regions important in the therapeutic actions of drugs that modify the endocannabinoid system and ( 2 ) the determination of the localization of the enzymes that synthesize , degrade , and transport the endocannabinoids .
