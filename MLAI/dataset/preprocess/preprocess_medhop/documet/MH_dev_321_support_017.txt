DB06626 for renal cell carcinoma . BACKGROUND : The approval of sunitinib , sorafenib and temsirolimus has dramatically altered the management of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . DB00112 plus IFN may also be added to the therapeutic armamentarium . DB06626 ( AG-013736 ) is an oral and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor . OBJECTIVE : Data supporting the development of axitinib for RCC are reviewed . METHODS : Preclinical and clinical data available for axitinib for RCC are presented . RESULTS : DB06626 inhibits P17948 , P35968 and P35916 with picomolar potencies , and P16234 , P09619 and c-kit with nanomolar potencies . Phase II clinical trials of axitinib in pretreated RCC following sorafenib or cytokine treatment have demonstrated promising activity accompanied by a favorable toxicity profile . Further development of axitinib for RCC is warranted .
