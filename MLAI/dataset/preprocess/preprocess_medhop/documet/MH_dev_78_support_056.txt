P35354 promotes early atherosclerotic lesion formation in P01130 -deficient mice . BACKGROUND : Atherosclerosis has features of an inflammatory disease . Because cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and promotes inflammation , we tested the hypotheses that selective P35354 inhibition would reduce early lesion formation in P01130 -deficient ( P01130 -/- ) mice and that macrophage P35354 expression contributes to atherogenesis in P01130 -/- mice . METHODS AND RESULTS : Treatment of male P01130 -/- mice fed the Western diet with rofecoxib or indomethacin for 6 weeks resulted in significant reductions in atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta ( 25 % and 37 % ) and in the aorta en face ( 58 % and 57 % ) , respectively . DB00533 treatment did not inhibit platelet thromboxane production , a P23219 -mediated process , but it significantly reduced the urinary prostacyclin metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1alpha . Fetal liver cell transplantation was used to generate P01130 -/- mice null for expression of the P35354 gene by macrophages . After 8 weeks on the Western diet , P35354 -/- --> P01130 -/- mice developed significantly less ( 33 % to 39 % ) atherosclerosis than control P35354 +/+ --> P01130 -/- mice . In both the inhibitor studies and the transplant studies , serum lipids did not differ significantly between groups . CONCLUSIONS : The present studies provide strong pharmacological and genetic evidence that P35354 promotes early atherosclerotic lesion formation in P01130 -/- mice in vivo . These results support the potential of anti-inflammatory approaches to the prevention of atherosclerosis .
