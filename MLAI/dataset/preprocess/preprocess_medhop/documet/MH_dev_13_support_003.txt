PDE10 inhibition increases P42261 and CREB phosphorylation and improves spatial and recognition memories in a Huntington 's disease mouse model . Huntington 's disease ( HD ) causes motor disturbances , preceded by cognitive impairment , in patients and mouse models . We showed that increased hippocampal DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) signaling disrupts recognition and spatial memories in R6 HD mouse models . However , unchanged levels of hippocampal phosphorylated ( p ) DB02527 -responsive element-binding protein ( CREB ) suggested unaltered nuclear PKA activity in R6 mice . Here , we extend this finding by showing that nuclear pPKA catalytic subunit ( Thr197 ) and pPKA substrate levels were unaltered in the hippocampus of R6/1 mice . Phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) play an important role in the regulation of PKA activity . Q9Y233 , a DB02527 /cGMP dual-substrate PDE , was reported to be restricted to the nuclear region in nonstriatal neurons . Using cell fractionation we confirmed that Q9Y233 was enriched in nuclear fractions , both in wild-type and R6/1 mice hippocampus , without differences in its levels or intracellular distribution between genotypes . We next investigated whether inhibition of PDE10 with papaverine could improve cognitive function in HD mice . DB01113 treatment improved spatial and object recognition memories in R6/1 mice , and significantly increased pGluA1 and pCREB levels in R6/1 mice hippocampus . DB01113 likely acted through the activation of the PKA pathway as the phosphorylation level of distinct cGMP-dependent kinase ( cGK ) substrates was not modified in either genotype . Moreover , hippocampal DB02527 , but not cGMP , levels were increased after acute papaverine injection . Our results show that inhibition of PDE10 improves cognition in R6 mice , at least in part through increased P42261 and CREB phosphorylation . Thus , PDE10 might be a good therapeutic target to improve cognitive impairment in HD .
