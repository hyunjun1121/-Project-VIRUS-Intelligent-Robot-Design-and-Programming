P08700 interleukin-5 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression in nasal polyps . PURPOSE : Nasal polyps ( NP ) are grape-like clusters of chronically inflamed tissue . Little is known about the underlying cells and cytokines involved in nasal polyposis . For the present study , we hypothesize that elevated tissue levels of interleukin-3 ( P08700 ) , interleukin-5 ( P05113 ) , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulation factor ( GM- P04141 ) contribute to eosinophil recruitment and activation in NP . MATERIALS AND METHODS : To begin to test this hypothesis , we evaluated P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 levels and distributions in nasal polyp specimens obtained intraoperatively from 13 patients and two normal controls . For these studies , nasal polyp levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , and P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 distribution was determined by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : Immunohistochemical staining of the NP indicated that in all 13 patient samples , P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 were associated with infiltrating cells , primarily eosinophils , in the NP . Quantitation of P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 in NP tissue homogenates indicated that P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 levels were evaluated in the NP tissues when compared with control tissues . Additionally , elevation of individual cytokines correlated with previous polypectomy ( P08700 ) , steroid use ( P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 ) , asthma ( P05113 ) , and age ( GM- P04141 ) . CONCLUSION : These data support our hypothesis that P08700 , P05113 , and GM- P04141 are likely to play a key role in eosinophil recruitment/activation and NP formation and support recently advanced theories that cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease .
