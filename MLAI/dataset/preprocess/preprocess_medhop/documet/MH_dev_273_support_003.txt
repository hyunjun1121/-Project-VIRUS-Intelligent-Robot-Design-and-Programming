Inhibitors of the interaction between P04275 and platelet GPIb/IX/V . The formation of platelet-rich thrombi , a critical step in the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic events , is a multistep process involving several components , among which von Willebrand Factor ( P04275 ) plays a central role . Ruptured atherosclerotic plaques expose subendothelial matrix proteins which bind P04275 that represents a bridge between the injured blood vessel and activated platelets , playing a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation , especially in conditions of high-shear rate . Due to these peculiarities , the binding of P04275 to GPIbα is an attractive drug target . Here we summarize the present knowledge on the different classes of drugs targeting the P04275 -GPIb interaction and we give an account of their level of clinical development . In particular , the following compounds are discussed : AJW200 , an IgG4 humanized monoclonal antibody against P04275 -A1 ; 82D6A3 , a monoclonal antibody against P04275 -A3 ; Q96JZ2 -0081 and Q96JZ2 -0681 , bivalent humanized nanobodies targeting the P04275 -A1 domain ; DB05202 and its advanced formulation ARC15105 , second-generation aptamers that bind the P04275 -A1 domain ; h6B4-Fab , a murine monoclonal antibody , and GPG-290 , a recombinant chimeric protein , both directed against GPIbα .
