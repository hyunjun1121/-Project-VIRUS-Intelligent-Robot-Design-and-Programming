A pilot study to evaluate the effects of P05155 on the toxicity of high-dose interleukin 2 . In a pilot study six patients received 4 days ' treatment with interleukin 2 ( P60568 ) [ cumulative dose ( CD ) 264 +/- 26 x 10(6) IU m-2 ] and P05155 ( DB05341 ) ( loading dose 2,000 U , followed by 500-1,000 U twice daily ) . Toxicity was compared with that in patients given 4 days ' treatment with standard ( CD 66 +/- 12 x 10(6) IU m-2 ) or escalating-dose ( CD 99 +/- 8 x 10(6) IU m-2 ) P60568 . P60568 -induced hypotension was equivalent and complement activation was less after P60568 + DB05341 ( C3a = 10.5 +/- 3.2 nmol l-1 ) than following standard ( 14.1 +/- 8.4 nmol l-1 ) or escalating-dose ( 18.3 +/- 2.9 nmol l-1 ) P60568 . This study demonstrates that DB05341 administration during P60568 treatment is safe and warrants further study to evaluate its ability to ameliorate P60568 -induced toxicity .
