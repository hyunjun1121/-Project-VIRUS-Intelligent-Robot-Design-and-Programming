Possible differences in the mechanism(s) of action of different glucocorticoid hormone compounds . Different glucocorticoid hormones ( P30793 ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity . The mechanism(s) of action of P30793 is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway . We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) on the production of cytokines ( P60568 , P05231 , P01375 , P22301 ) by peripheral T lymphocytes , and the effects on the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity by activated Jurkat cell line . The data obtained show that the three P30793 molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) not all the cytokines investigated were affected , and not with the same intensity , by the three P30793 and ( b ) DB00514 inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN . These data are in agreement with the concept that different P30793 compounds might differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with transcription factor .
