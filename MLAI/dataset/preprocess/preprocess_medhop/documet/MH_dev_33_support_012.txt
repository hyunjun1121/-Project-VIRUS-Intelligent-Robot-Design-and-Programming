Hepatic stellate cells undermine the allostimulatory function of liver myeloid dendritic cells via P40763 -dependent induction of P14902 . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) are critical for hepatic wound repair and tissue remodeling . They also produce cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the maintenance of hepatic immune homeostasis and the inherent tolerogenicity of the liver . The functional relationship between HSCs and the professional migratory APCs in the liver , that is , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , has not been evaluated . In this article , we report that murine liver DCs colocalize with HSCs in vivo under normal , steady-state conditions , and cluster with HSCs in vitro . In vitro , HSCs secrete high levels of DC chemoattractants , such as MΙP-1α and P13500 , as well as cytokines that modulate DC activation , including P01375 -α , P05231 , and IL-1β . Culture of HSCs with conventional liver myeloid ( m ) DCs resulted in increased P05231 and P22301 secretion compared with that of either cell population alone . Coculture also resulted in enhanced expression of costimulatory ( P33681 , P42081 ) and coinhibitory ( Q9NZQ7 ) molecules on mDCs . P19526 -induced mDC maturation required cell-cell contact and could be blocked , in part , by neutralizing MΙP-1α or P13500 . P19526 -induced mDC maturation was dependent on activation of P40763 in mDCs and , in part , on P19526 -secreted P05231 . Despite upregulation of costimulatory molecules , mDCs conditioned by HSCs demonstrated impaired ability to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation , which was independent of Q9NZQ7 , but dependent upon P19526 -induced P40763 activation and subsequent upregulation of P14902 . In conclusion , by promoting P14902 expression , HSCs may act as potent regulators of liver mDCs and function to maintain hepatic homeostasis and tolerogenicity .
