The tyrosine kinase inhibitor cediranib blocks ligand-induced vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 activity and lymphangiogenesis . Solid tumors express a range of factors required to sustain their growth and promote their dissemination . Among these are vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( P15692 ) , the key angiogenic stimulant , and P49767 , a primary mediator of lymphangiogenesis . Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors offer the potential to inhibit more than one kinase and impede tumor growth by multiple mechanisms . However , their potency toward individual targets can vary . Cediranib ( RECENTIN ; DB04849 ) is an inhibitor of P15692 signaling that has been shown in experimental models to prevent P15692 -induced angiogenesis and primary tumor growth , yet the effects of cediranib on P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) -3-mediated endothelial cell function and lymphangiogenesis are unknown . To better understand the activity of cediranib against P35916 and its associated signaling events compared with its activity against P35968 , we used the receptor-specific ligands Q9NRA1 and P15692 -C156S . In human endothelial cells , cediranib inhibited Q9NRA1 -induced phosphorylation of P35968 and P15692 -C156S-induced phosphorylation of P35916 at concentrations of </= 1nmol/L and inhibited activation of downstream signaling molecules . Additionally , cediranib blocked P15692 -C156S-induced and Q9NRA1 -induced proliferation , survival , and migration of lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells . In vivo , cediranib ( 6 mg/kg/d ) prevented angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis induced by Q9NRA1 -expressing and P15692 -C156S-expressing adenoviruses , respectively . Cediranib ( 6 mg/kg/day ) also blocked angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis induced by adenoviruses expressing P15692 or P49767 and compromised the blood and lymphatic vasculatures of P49767 -expressing tumors . Cediranib may , therefore , be an effective means of preventing tumor progression , not only by inhibiting P35968 activity and angiogenesis , but also by concomitantly inhibiting P35916 activity and lymphangiogenesis .
