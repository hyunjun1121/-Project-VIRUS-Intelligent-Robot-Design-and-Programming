[ Association and interaction of AGT , P30556 , P12821 , P07550 , P21728 , P35611 , P35612 , P20020 , P21731 and P35354 genes on the risk of hypertension in Antioquian population ] . INTRODUCTION : Hypertension is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic and environmental components , with its prevalence varying across ethnic groups . Manifold studies on blood pressure regulatory system genes have been carried out -such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , the sympathetic nervous system , endothelial factor , and sodium balance- , but the results yielded were inconsistent among populations . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effect of both variants in genes AGT , P30556 , P12821 , P07550 , P21728 , P35611 , P35612 , P20020 , P21731 P35354 , and the result of the individual ancestry component on hypertension and blood pressure levels among population in Antioquia . METHODS AND MATERIALS : 107 cases and 253 controls were genotyped for 12 variants on genes AGT , P30556 , P12821 , P07550 , P21728 , P35611 , P35612 , P20020 , P21731 y P35354 , and for 20 ancestry informative markers . The association of polymorphisms and their interactions , and the association of ancestral genetic composition with hypertension and blood pressure levels were examined . RESULTS : Genes P35612 , rs4852706 ( OR=3.0 ; p=0.023 ) ; P21728 , rs686 ( OR=0.38 ; p=0.012 ) and P07550 , rs1042718 ( OR=10.0 ; p=0.008 ) ; as well as genotypic combinations of P21728 and P30556 ; AGT and P35611 ; and P35611 to P20020 and P35354 were associated to hypertension . The Amerindian ancestry component was associated to some decrease in diastolic blood pressure . CONCLUSION : Variants on genes P35612 , P21728 , P07550 , P30556 , AGT , P35611 , P20020 and P35354 individually or interacting , are associated to hypertension . The Amerindian ancestry component has an effect on blood pressure .
