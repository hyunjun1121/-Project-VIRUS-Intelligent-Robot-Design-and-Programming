P32297 variant for lung cancer is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Korea . BACKGROUND : Genome-wide association studies have identified P32297 as a lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) candidate gene in non-Hispanic Caucasian cohorts . However , there are differences in minor allele frequencies among ethnic groups , and limited data exists for Asian populations . OBJECTIVES : The aim of this case-control study was to determine whether there is an association between P48444 and genetic variation in P32297 in the Korean population . In addition , we investigated the association of P32297 with intermediate disease phenotypes including emphysema and lung function in P48444 subjects . METHODS : Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in P32297 ( rs660652 and rs12910984 ) were genotyped in 219 P48444 subjects registered in the Korean Obstructive Lung Disease cohort study and in 305 control subjects . Volumetric computed tomography was performed in all P48444 subjects . Emphysema severity was measured quantitatively by determining the volume fraction of the lung below -950 Hounsfield units . Logistic regression analysis for case-control analysis and linear regression modeling for quantitative analysis were performed using SAS . RESULTS : This case-control analysis of 219 P48444 patients and 305 control participants identified a significant association between an SNP of P32297 ( rs12910984 ) and P48444 ( p = 0.049 ) . Analysis in P48444 subjects revealed that genetic variations were not associated with FEV1 . There was no association between SNPs and emphysema severity . However , both SNPs were significantly associated with DLCO . CONCLUSION : Genetic variations in P32297 are associated with P48444 in the Korean population .
