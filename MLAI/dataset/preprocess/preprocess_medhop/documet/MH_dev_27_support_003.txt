Lack of significant effects of the type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci Q86VZ6 , O75794 / Q8IU85 , Q04721 , Q9P2N4 , Q6YHU6 , and P19075 / O75473 on diabetes and quantitative metabolic traits . Recently , several novel loci reaching genome-wide significance levels for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) were identified through a meta-analysis of three genome-wide scans and large-scale follow-up . The aim of our study was to investigate the association of these loci with T2D and related subphenotypes in two cohorts from Germany . We performed an association study of 9 SNPs in or around Q86VZ6 , O75794 / Q8IU85 , Q04721 , Q9H165 , Q9P2N4 , P15692 , P81605 , Q6YHU6 , and P19075 / O75473 with T2D and related quantitative traits ( fasting insulin and glucose , indices derived from OGTT ) in the isolated population of Sorbs ( 205 cases and 695 controls ) and in a mixed German population ( Leipzig ) ( 938 subjects with and 918 without T2D ) . None of the variants was associated with T2D , but the meta-analysis of both cohorts revealed a modest trend of association of rs7578597 in Q6YHU6 with T2D ( p=0.055 ) . Furthermore , Sorbian subjects homozygous for the rs7578597 T-allele had lower mean 30-minute plasma insulin when compared with carriers of the C-allele ( p < 0.05 ) . The T-allele was also nominally associated with higher fasting plasma glucose in the Leipzig cohort ( p < 0.05 ) . Although several other SNPs showed some evidence for association with T2D-related traits the effects were not replicated within our study . Associations of the T2D-risk alleles with T2D or related subphenotypes were overall very weak in the approximately 2 700 subjects studied . This is compatible with the modest effect size of these " second sweep " variants , which will require large-scale association studies on quantitative traits to clarify their role in the pathophysiology of T2D .
