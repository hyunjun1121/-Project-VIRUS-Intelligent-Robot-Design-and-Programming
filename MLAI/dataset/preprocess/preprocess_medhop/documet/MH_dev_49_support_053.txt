Cooperative Hedgehog- P00533 signaling . It has been known for many years that cooperative interactions between oncogenes ( e.g. DB01367 , MYC , P10415 ) can fuel cancer growth ( 1-5 ) , but the restricted druggability of many of those interacting cancer genes has hampered translation of combined targeting to medical cancer therapy . The identification and characterization of cooperative cancer signaling pathways amenable to medical therapy is therefore a crucial step towards the establishment of efficient targeted combination treatments urgently needed to improve cancer therapy . Here we review recent findings of our group and colleagues on the molecular mechanisms of cooperative Hedgehog/ P08151 and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( P00533 ) signaling , two clinically relevant oncogenic pathways involved in the development of many human malignancies . We also discuss the possible implications of these findings for the design of a therapeutic regimen relying on combined targeting of key effectors of both pathways .
