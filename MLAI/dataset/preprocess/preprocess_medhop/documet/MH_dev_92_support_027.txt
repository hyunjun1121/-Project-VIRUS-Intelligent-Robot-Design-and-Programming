DB00583 palmitoyl transferase II polymorphism is associated with multiple syndromes of acute encephalopathy with various infectious diseases . The high incidence of acute encephalopathy in East Asia suggests the role of genetic factors in its pathogenesis . It has recently been reported that variations of the P23786 ( carnitine palmitoyl transferase II ) gene may be associated with fatal or severe cases of influenza-associated encephalopathy . In the present study , we examined the genotype of P23786 in cases of acute encephalopathy associated with various preceding infections . Twenty-nine Japanese patients with acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion ( AESD ) or acute necrotizing encephalopathy ( ANE ) were studied . The frequency of F352C of P23786 exon 4 was significantly higher in patients than in controls . All patients who had allele C in F352C had allele I in V368I and allele M in M647V ( CIM haplotype ) , which reportedly decreases P23786 activity to one third of that with Q9UBW7 or FVM haplotype . The frequency of CIM haplotype was significantly different between patients and controls , but not between AESD and ANE . Our results revealed that having at least one CIM allele is a risk factor for the onset of acute encephalopathy , regardless of its antecedent infections .
