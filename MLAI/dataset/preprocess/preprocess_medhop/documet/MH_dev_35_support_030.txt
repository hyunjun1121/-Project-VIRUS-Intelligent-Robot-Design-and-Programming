Placental autophagy regulation by the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 rheostat . Autophagy is the catabolic degradation of cellular cytoplasmic constituents via the lysosomal pathway that physiologically elicits a primarily cytoprotective function , but can rapidly be upregulated in response to stressors thereby inducing cell death . We have reported that the balance between the P10415 family proteins Q9UMX3 and Q07820 regulates human trophoblast cell fate and its alteration toward cell death typifies preeclampsia . Here we demonstrate that Q9UMX3 is a potent inducer of autophagy as shown by increased LC3B-II production , autophagosomal formation and lysosomal activation in P29320 293 . In contrast , using JEG3 cells we showed that prosurvival Q07820 acts as a repressor of autophagy via an interaction with Q14457 , which is abrogated by Q9UMX3 . We found that Q07820 -cleaved products , specifically MCL1c157 , trigger autophagy while the splicing variant MCL1S has no effect . Treatment of JEG3 cells with nitric oxide donor SNP resulted in Q9UMX3 - Q07820 rheostat dysregulation , favoring Q9UMX3 accumulation , thereby inducing autophagy . Overexpression of Q07820 rescued oxidative stress-induced autophagy . Of clinical relevance , we report aberrant autophagy levels in the preeclamptic placenta due to impaired recruitment of Q14457 to Q07820 . Our data provided the first evidence for a key role of the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 system in regulating autophagy in the human placenta , whereby an adverse environment as seen in preeclampsia tilts the Q9UMX3 - Q07820 balance toward the build-up of isoforms that triggers placental autophagy .
