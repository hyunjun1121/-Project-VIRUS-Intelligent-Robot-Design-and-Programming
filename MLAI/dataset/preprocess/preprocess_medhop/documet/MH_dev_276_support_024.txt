Activation of histamine H4 receptor inhibits TNFα/IMD-0354-induced apoptosis in human salivary NS-SV-AC cells . Apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of Sjögren 's syndrome ( SS ) , an autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands . Our recent studies revealed diminished histamine H4 receptor ( H₄R ) expression and impaired histamine transport in the salivary gland epithelial cells in SS . The aim was now to test if nanomolar histamine and high-affinity H₄R signaling affect apoptosis of human salivary gland epithelial cell . Simian virus 40-immortalized acinar NS-SV-AC cells were cultured in serum-free keratinocyte medium ± histamine H₄R agonist HST-10 . Expression and internalization of H₄R were studied by immunofluorescence staining ± clathrin inhibitor methyl-β-cyclodextrin ( MβCD ) . Apoptosis induced using tumor necrosis factor-α with nuclear factor-κB inhibitor IMD-0354 was studied using phase contrast microscopy , Western blot , flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . HST-10-stimulated H₄R internalization was inhibited by MβCD . Western blotting revealed diminished phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK , but unchanged levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase pERK1/2 in H₄R-stimulated samples compared to controls . qRT-PCR showed up-regulated expression of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-extra large/Bcl-xL mRNAs and proteins , whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein/ Q07812 remained unchanged in Q9H3N8 -stimulated samples . H₄R stimulation diminished cleavage of PARP and flow cytometry showed significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect of H₄R stimulation on apoptosis . As far as we know this is the first study showing inhibitory effect of H₄R activation on apoptosis of human salivary gland cells . Diminished H₄R-mediated activation may contribute to loss of immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases and in SS in particular .
