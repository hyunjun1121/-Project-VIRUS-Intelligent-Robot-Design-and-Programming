New insights into the role of DB02527 in the production and function of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) . The proglucagon gene ( gcg ) encodes both glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) , produced in pancreatic alpha cells and intestinal endocrine L cells , respectively . The incretin hormone P0C6A0 stimulates insulin secretion and pro-insulin gene transcription . P0C6A0 also enhances pancreatic beta-cell proliferation , inhibits cell apoptosis , and has been utilized in the trans-differentiation of insulin producing cells . A long-term effective P43220 agonist , DB01276 , has now been developed as the drug in treating type II diabetes and potentially other metabolic disorders . The expression of gcg and the production of P0C6A0 can be activated by the elevation of the second messenger cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) . Recent studies suggest that in addition to protein kinase A ( PKA ) , exchange protein activated by DB02527 ( Epac ) , another effector of DB02527 , and the crosstalk between PKA and the Wnt signaling pathway , are involved in DB02527 -stimulated gcg transcription and P0C6A0 production as well . Finally , functions of P0C6A0 in pancreatic beta cells are also mediated by PKA , Epac , as well as the effector of the Wnt signaling pathway . Together , these novel findings bring us a new insight into the role of DB02527 in the production and function of the incretin hormone P0C6A0 .
