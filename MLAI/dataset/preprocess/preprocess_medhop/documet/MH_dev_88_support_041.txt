The challenges of reliance on insulin-like growth factor I in monitoring disease activity in patients with acromegaly . Serum insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) is an important marker of disease activity in patients with acromegaly , and epidemiological data indicate control of circulating P05019 in patients with acromegaly restores life expectancy to normal . Improvements in the quality of , and access to , P05019 assays has encouraged monitoring of acromegaly with P05019 , although circulating growth hormone ( GH ) and P05019 values provide different information , so ideally both should be monitored . However , the introduction of the P10912 antagonist pegvisomant poses new challenges . DB00082 binds with high affinity to GH receptors , thereby blocking the action of GH at the tissue level and rendering the hormone biologically inactive . This leaves P05019 as the principal marker of disease activity . It is conceptually possible to induce a state of functional GH deficiency ( GHD ) with pegvisomant with P05019 values within the normal range . With the goal of minimizing the risk of over-treatment and GHD , we have provided preliminary guidance on the target range for P05019 in patients receiving pegvisomant based on the gender- and decade-based percentile ranges for P05019 of adult patients with untreated GHD enrolled in the Pfizer International Metabolic Database ( KIMS ) .
