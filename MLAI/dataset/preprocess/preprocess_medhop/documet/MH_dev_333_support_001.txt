Q16739 -100 , a novel galectin-3 antagonist , modulates Q8WXI8 -1 , Q13794 , and cell cycle to induce myeloma cell death . Q16739 -100 is a galectin-3 antagonist with an acceptable human safety profile that has been demonstrated to have an antimyeloma effect in the context of bortezomib resistance . In the present study , the mechanisms of action of Q16739 -100 are elucidated in myeloma cell lines and primary tumor cells . Q16739 -100 induced inhibition of proliferation , accumulation of cells in sub-G(1) and G(1) phases , and apoptosis with activation of both caspase-8 and -9 pathways . Dose- and time-dependent decreases in Q8WXI8 -1 and BCL-X(L) levels also occurred , accompanied by a rapid induction of Q13794 protein , whereas BCL-2 , Q07812 , Q16611 , O43521 , Q92934 , P55957 , and PUMA remained unchanged . The cell-cycle inhibitor P38936 (Cip1) was up-regulated by Q16739 -100 , whereas the procycling proteins CYCLIN E2 , CYCLIN D2 , and Q00534 were all reduced . Reduction in signal transduction was associated with lower levels of activated P25963 , O15111 , and AKT as well as lack of P25963 and AKT activation after appropriate cytokine stimulation ( insulin-like growth factor-1 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) . Primary myeloma cells showed a direct reduction in proliferation and viability . These data demonstrate that the novel therapeutic molecule , Q16739 -100 , is a potent modifier of myeloma cell biology targeting apoptosis , cell cycle , and intracellular signaling and has potential for myeloma therapy .
