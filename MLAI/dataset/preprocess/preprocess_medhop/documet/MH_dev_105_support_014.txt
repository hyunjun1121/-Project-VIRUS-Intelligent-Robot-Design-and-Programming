DB08916 for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer . INTRODUCTION : The inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) through tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) represents an effective strategy for P00533 -mutated NSCLC . DB08916 is an irreversible erythroblastosis oncogene B ( ErbB ) family blocker , able to inhibit the kinase domains of P00533 , P04626 and Q15303 , and the transphosphorylation of ErbB3 that has recently been approved in the United States for the first-line treatment of P00533 -mutated NSCLC and in Europe and Japan for the treatment of P00533 -mutated TKI-naive patients . AREAS COVERED : The authors analyzed the pharmacology and the clinical activity of afatinib in NSCLC through a review of the literature . Trials exploring different settings have been reported , including LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 , where the drug achieved better outcomes in terms of response rate , progression-free survival and quality of life compared with chemotherapy . The main toxicities of afatinib are gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events . EXPERT OPINION : DB08916 showed remarkable efficacy as a first-line treatment in the presence of common P00533 mutations . DB08916 showed some activity in NSCLC with acquired resistance to P00533 TKIs , although , currently , its efficacy after the failure of erlotinib or gefitinib has not been clearly stated . Direct clinical data comparing the activity and tolerability of different inhibitors are still needed .
