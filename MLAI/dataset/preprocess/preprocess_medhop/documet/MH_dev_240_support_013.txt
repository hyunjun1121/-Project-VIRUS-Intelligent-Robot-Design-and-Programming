Informative gene network for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy . BACKGROUND : Host genetic variability has been implicated in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) . A dose-limiting toxicity for chemotherapy agents , CIPN is also a debilitating condition that may progress to chronic neuropathic pain . We utilized a bioinformatics approach , which captures the complexity of intracellular and intercellular interactions , to identify genes for CIPN . METHODS : Using genes pooled from the literature as a starting point , we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) to generate gene networks for CIPN . RESULTS : We performed IPA core analysis for genes associated with platinum- , taxane- and platinum-taxane-induced neuropathy . We found that P05231 , P01375 , P10145 , P01584 and P27361 /2 were the top genes in terms of the number of connections in platinum-induced neuropathy and P04637 , MYC , P09874 , O75791 MAPK and P01375 for combined taxane-platinum-induced neuropathy . CONCLUSION : Neurotoxicity is common in cancer patients treated with platinum compounds and anti-microtubule agents and CIPN is one of the debilitating sequela . The bioinformatic approach helped identify genes associated with CIPN in cancer patients .
