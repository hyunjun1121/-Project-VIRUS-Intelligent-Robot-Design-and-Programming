P15121 inhibition suppresses azoxymethane-induced colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice . Type-2 diabetes and obesity-related metabolic abnormalities are major risk factors for the development of colon cancer . In the present study , we examined the effects of polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase ( AR ) inhibitor , fidarestat , on the development of azoxymethane ( AOM ) -induced colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese mice . Our results indicate that fidarestat given in the drinking water caused a significant reduction in the total number of colonic premalignant lesions in the AOM treated obese mice . Further , the expression levels of PKC-β2 , AKT , P35354 and P35228 in the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice were significantly decreased by fidarestat . The serum levels of IL-1α , P02778 , Q07325 , P01375 -α and P15692 are significantly suppressed in AOM + fidarestat treated obese mice . DB02021 also decreased the expression of P35354 , P35228 , P98170 , survivin , β-catenin and NF-κB in high glucose-treated HT29 colon cancer cells . In conclusion , our results indicate that fidarestat inhibits the development of colonic premalignant lesions in an obesity-related colon cancer and is chemopreventive to colorectal carcinogenesis in obese individuals .
