Differential expression of the alternatively spliced P35372 isoform μ-opioid receptor-1K in HIV-infected individuals . OBJECTIVE : We previously examined the expression of specific C-terminal μ-opioid receptor ( MOR ) splice variants in human central nervous system cell types and HIV-infected brain tissue from individuals with neurocognitive impairment ± HIV encephalitis ( HIVE ) . In the present study , we examined the N-terminal splice variant MOR-1K , which mediates excitatory cellular signaling . METHODS AND RESULTS : We found segregation of expression ranging from undetectable to seemingly exclusive across nervous system cell types compared to the pool of C-terminal MOR splice variants using the real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . Expression of MOR-1K mRNA was also increased in HIV-infected individuals with combined neurocognitive impairment and HIVE compared with the other groups . MOR-1K expression correlated with the level of patient neurocognitive impairment , whereas the pool of C-terminal MOR splice variants did not . HIVE was also associated with increased expression of the inflammatory mediators P13500 , P80075 , and RANTES , but not the host HIV coreceptors P61073 and P51681 or the P01730 receptor using qRT-PCR . Network analysis of microarray data from these same patients revealed filamin A ( P21333 ) as a possible interaction partner with MOR-1K , and P21333 gene expression was also found to be upregulated in HIVE using qRT-PCR . Overexpression of P21333 in HEK293 cells redistributed MOR-1K from intracellular compartments to the cell surface . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that HIVE , and neurocognitive impairment depending on its severity , are associated with enhanced MOR-1K signaling through both increased expression and trafficking to the cell surface , which may alter the contribution of MOR receptor isoforms and exacerbate the effects of MOR activation in neuroAIDS .
