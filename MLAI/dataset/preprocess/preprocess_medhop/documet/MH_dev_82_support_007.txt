Methodological challenges in monitoring new treatments for rare diseases : lessons from the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome registry . BACKGROUND : The Q96P20 -Associated Periodic Syndromes ( CAPS ) are a group of rare hereditary autoinflammatory diseases and encompass Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome ( FCAS ) , Muckle-Wells Syndrome ( MWS ) , and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease ( NOMID ) . DB06168 is a monoclonal antibody directed against P01584 and approved for CAPS patients but requires post-approval monitoring due to low and short exposures during the licensing process . Creative approaches to observational methodology are needed , harnessing novel registry strategies to ensure Health Care Provider reporting and patient monitoring . METHODS : A web-based registry was set up to collect information on long-term safety and effectiveness of canakinumab for CAPS . RESULTS : Starting in November 2009 , this registry enrolled 241 patients in 43 centers and 13 countries by December 31 , 2012 . One-third of the enrolled population was aged < 18 ; the overall population is evenly divided by gender . Enrolment is ongoing for children . CONCLUSIONS : Innovative therapies in orphan diseases require post-approval structures to enable in depth understanding of safety and natural history of disease . The rarity and distribution of such diseases and unpredictability of treatment require innovative methods for enrolment and follow-up . Broad international practice-based recruitment and web-based data collection are practical .
