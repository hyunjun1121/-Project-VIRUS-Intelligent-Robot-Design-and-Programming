Brain 5-HT and inhibition of aggressive behavior in animals : 5-HIAA and receptor subtypes . Evolutionary constant serotonin ( 5-HT ) neuronal systems evolved along medial brain structures ; yet , wide variations in functionality characterize serotonergic systems in mediating aggressive responses in species ranging from lobsters , ants , electric fish , and rodents to primates . So far , the attempts to correlate cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) levels with measures of aggression have revealed inverse , direct , or no correlations in different nonhuman primate species . It is difficult to harmonize the occasional correlations between P04141 5-HIAA and adaptive aggressive acts in nonhuman primates ( a ) with clinically diagnosed suicidal or impulsive individuals , and ( b ) with the biochemical , anatomical , and presumably functional differentiation of 5-HT pathways and receptor subtypes . Eltoprazine , a mixed P08908 /B agonist , and meta-trifluoro-methylphenyl-piperazine HCl ( TFMPP ) , a more selective P28222 agonist , specifically decrease aggressive behavior in several animal species and situations in both sexes without detriment to other social , exploratory , or motoric activities . A definite role for P08908 , 5-HT2 , and 5- Q9H205 receptor subtypes in the mechanisms mediating aggressive behaviors has to await the development of selective agonists and antagonists , respectively .
