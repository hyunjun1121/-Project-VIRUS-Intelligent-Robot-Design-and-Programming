DB00197 inhibits tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) has been implicated in the differentiation and growth inhibition of cancer cells . We examined the effects of PPARgamma activation by troglitazone on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell growth , proliferation , and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo . We also studied relationships between PPARgamma activation and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression . Human HCC cell lines Huh7 and Hep3B were cultured in the presence or absence of troglitazone . Cell growth was determined via WST-1 assay , proliferation by cell cycle analysis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) Western blotting , and apoptosis by flow cytometry and TUNEL . Tumor growth after subcutaneous implantation of Huh7 cells in nude mice was monitored , and the effects of treatment with troglitazone were determined . In resected HCCs , PPARgamma expression was less compared with the histologically normal surrounding liver . In cultures of Hep3B and Huh7 cells , basal expression of PPARgamma was relatively low , but troglitazone caused dose-dependent induction of PPARgamma expression . Cell cycle analysis revealed a decreased proportion of cells in S phase , with arrest at G0/ P55008 . Concomitant downregulation of P12004 and an increase in TUNEL staining , cells were consistent with decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis by troglitazaone . DB00197 -mediated PPARgamma activation also suppressed P35354 expression and induced p27 in HCC cells . Administration of troglitazone to Huh7 tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced tumor growth and caused tumor regression . In conclusion , collectively , these results indicate that PPARgamma could be a regulator of cell survival and growth in HCC . PPARgamma therefore represents a putative molecular target for chemopreventive therapy or inhibition of liver cancer growth .
