A novel mechanism of mechanical stress-induced hypertrophy . Angiotensin II ( AII ) type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor plays a critical role in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy . We have recently found a novel mechanism of mechanical stress-induced activation of the AT1 receptor , which is independent of AII . Mechanical stretch did not activate ERKs in HEK293 cells and COS7 cells which had no AT1 receptor , but when AT1 receptor was overexpressed in these cells , stretch activated ERKs , Galphaq and O60674 . An AT1 receptor blocker , candesartan , inhibited stretch-induced activation of ERKs in these cells . Stretch also activated ERKs in COS7 cells expressing AT1 mutant which did not bind AII and in cardiac myocytes prepared from angiotensinogen null mice . Stretch did not activate ERKs in COS7 cells which overexpressed P25101 receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor . Pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy in angiotensinogen null mice as well as in wild-type mice , which was significantly inhibited by candesartan . These results suggest that mechanical stress activates AT1 receptor independently of AII , which is inhibited by an inverse agonist candesartan .
