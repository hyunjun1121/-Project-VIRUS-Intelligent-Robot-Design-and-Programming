Chronic rapamycin restores brain vascular integrity and function through NO synthase activation and improves memory in symptomatic mice modeling Alzheimer 's disease . Vascular pathology is a major feature of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and other dementias . We recently showed that chronic administration of the target-of-rapamycin ( TOR ) inhibitor rapamycin , which extends lifespan and delays aging , halts the progression of AD-like disease in transgenic human (h) P05067 mice modeling AD when administered before disease onset . Here we demonstrate that chronic reduction of TOR activity by rapamycin treatment started after disease onset restored cerebral blood flow ( Q03701 ) and brain vascular density , reduced cerebral amyloid angiopathy and microhemorrhages , decreased amyloid burden , and improved cognitive function in symptomatic hAPP ( AD ) mice . Like acetylcholine ( ACh ) , a potent vasodilator , acute rapamycin treatment induced the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase ( P29474 ) and NO release in brain endothelium . Administration of the NOS inhibitor L-NG- DB04223 methyl ester reversed vasodilation as well as the protective effects of rapamycin on Q03701 and vasculature integrity , indicating that rapamycin preserves vascular density and Q03701 in AD mouse brains through NOS activation . Taken together , our data suggest that chronic reduction of TOR activity by rapamycin blocked the progression of AD-like cognitive and histopathological deficits by preserving brain vascular integrity and function . Drugs that inhibit the TOR pathway may have promise as a therapy for AD and possibly for vascular dementias .
