Effects of inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor at time of selection on follicular angiogenesis , expansion , development and atresia in the marmoset . This study determined the effects of inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) at follicle selection . Marmosets were given an injection of P15692 antagonist , the DB08885 on Day 5 of the follicular phase and ovaries were evaluated on Day 10 or 15 . Ovaries from controls were assessed on Day 5 ( time of selection ) , Day 10 ( peri-ovulatory ) and Day 15 ( luteal phase ) . At Day 10 , ovaries of four of the five controls contained dominant follicles , while one had ovulated . DB08885 -treated ovaries also contained large follicles on Day 10 , but P15692 inhibition had suppressed endothelial cell proliferation , leading to reductions in the thecal vascularization and plasma estradiol relative to controls . By Day 15 , ovaries of controls contained active corpora lutea whereas ovaries of four of the five treated animals still contained large antral follicles similar in size to pre-ovulatory follicles , and one had small , avascular corpora lutea . However , these follicles had a restricted vasculature , increased incidence of activated caspase-3 staining and morphological features indicating they would become degenerative non-functional cysts . These results show that after follicle selection , P15692 is essential for angiogenesis and the generation of healthy ovulatory follicles and corpora lutea , but fluid accumulation can still occur in selected follicles in the absence of P15692 .
