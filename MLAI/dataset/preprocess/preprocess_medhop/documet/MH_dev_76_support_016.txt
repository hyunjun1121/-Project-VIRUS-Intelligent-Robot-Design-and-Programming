Calcimimetics in the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder . Mineral and bone disorders ( MBD ) are both an early and very common complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . It is now accepted that they represent a significant risk factor , explaining the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients . During the last decade , we have been witnessing many advances in the nomenclature , classification , pathophysiology , diagnosis , and treatment of CKD and some of its complications , such as CKD-MBD . The identification of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) involvement in the pathogenesis of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) and the availability of a new class of drugs called calcimimetics are two outstanding examples . DB01012 , the only available calcimimetic , has been shown to be a very effective therapeutic tool in CKD-MBD . Many clinical trials with cinacalcet in hemodialysis patients with SHPT have shown a reduction in parathyroid hormone , calcium ( Ca ) , phosphate ( P ) and Ca x P product levels , allowing far greater success in reaching therapeutic goals as recommended by international guidelines . Additionally , some studies have shown that the use of cinacalcet may improve other aspects of CKD-MBD , reducing the risk of vascular calcification and parathyroidectomy , among others . Prospective studies on dialysis patients , with hard endpoint data , are currently underway . This review summarizes the most significant aspects of calcimimimetics based on both experimental and clinical results , underlining their possibilities not only for the treatment of isolated SHPT but also for other CKD-MBD related conditions .
