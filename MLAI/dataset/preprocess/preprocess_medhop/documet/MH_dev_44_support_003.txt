Transcript and protein profiling identifies signaling , growth arrest , apoptosis , and NF-κB survival signatures following P01148 receptor activation . P01148 significantly inhibits proliferation of a proportion of cancer cell lines by activating P01148 receptor ( P30968 ) -G protein signaling . Therefore , manipulation of P30968 signaling may have an under-utilized role in treating certain breast and ovarian cancers . However , the precise signaling pathways necessary for the effect and the features of cellular responses remain poorly defined . We used transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to characterize the effects of P30968 activation in sensitive cells ( HEK293- P30968 , SCL60 ) in vitro and in vivo , compared to unresponsive HEK293 . Analyses of gene expression demonstrated a dynamic response to the P01148 superagonist DB06825 . Early and mid-phase changes ( 0.5-1.0 h ) comprised mainly transcription factors . Later changes ( 8-24 h ) included a P01148 target gene , P01215 , and up- or downregulation of transcripts encoding signaling and cell division machinery . Pathway analysis identified altered MAPK and cell cycle pathways , consistent with occurrence of G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway gene transcripts were differentially expressed between control and DB06825 -treated SCL60 cultures . Reverse-phase protein and phospho-proteomic array analyses profiled responses in cultured cells and SCL60 xenografts in vivo during DB06825 anti-proliferation . Increased phosphorylated NF-κB ( p65 ) occurred in SCL60 in vitro , and p-NF-κB and IκBε were higher in treated xenografts than controls after 4 days DB06825 . NF-κB inhibition enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of DB06825 in SCL60 cultures . This study reveals details of pathways interacting with intense P30968 signaling , identifies potential anti-proliferative target genes , and implicates the NF-κB survival pathway as a node for enhancing P01148 agonist-induced anti-proliferation .
