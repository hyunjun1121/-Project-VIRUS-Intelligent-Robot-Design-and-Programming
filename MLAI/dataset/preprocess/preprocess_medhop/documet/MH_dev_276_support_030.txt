Molecular response of HL-60 cells to mitotic inhibitors vincristine and taxol visualized with apoptosis-related gene expressions , including the new member Q9HB09 . DB01229 and vincristine belong to a group of anticancer drugs that target microtubules , subsequently arresting cells at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and inducing programmed cell death . The P10415 ( bcl-2 ) family of genes is of known implication in apoptosis induced by various stimuli , among which Q9HB09 , a new member of the family , cloned by our group . For further insights into the mechanisms and molecular targets implicated and modified as a result of apoptosis induced by these two mitosis-arresting drugs , we studied the possible alterations , at the mRNA level , of various apoptosis-related genes ( P10415 , Q07812 , Q9HB09 , CASPASE-3 , FAS ) after leukemia cell ( HL-60 ) treatment with these drugs . The kinetics of cell toxicity were evaluated by the MTT [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ] method , trypan blue staining , and cell proliferation efficiency ; apoptosis induction was assayed by endonucleosomal cleavage of DNA ( DNA laddering ) ; and the expression levels of the genes were analysed by RT-PCR , using gene-specific primers . The percentage of nonviable cells was upregulated with increasing cell exposure time and drug concentrations to both taxol and vincristine . Distinct modulations of apoptosis-related genes at the mRNA level were also observed , mainly concerning P10415 and Q9HB09 along apoptosis induction . Our results indicate and support the hypothesis that the apoptosis-related genes P10415 and Q9HB09 respond similarly to treatment of the human , acute , myelocytic leukemia HL60 cells with the anticancer drugs vincristine and taxol though in a drug-specific and time-dependent manner .
