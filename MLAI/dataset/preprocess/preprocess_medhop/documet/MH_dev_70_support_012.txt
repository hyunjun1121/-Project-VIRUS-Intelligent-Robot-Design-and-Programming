Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of potential anti-leishmanial targeted drugs of pyrimethamine . DB00205 , an antimalarial drug , was found to be able to inhibit both enzymes ( P00374 -TS and PTR1 ) of the leishmanial folate pathway , although this effect in vivo appears only in relatively high concentrations . To reach the parasites inside macrophage cells , where they are sheltered , targeted drugs of pyrimethamine , carboxymethyldextran-thiomannopyranoside-pyrimethamine ( CMD-P ) , and succinyldextran-thiomannopyranoside-pyrimethamine ( SD-P ) , were synthesized and assayed against L.(L.) amazonensis amastigotes . CMD-P has 2.43 % and SD-P has 2.58 % of pyrimethamine attached . At a CMD-P dose of 200 microg/mL ( 4.86 microg/mL pyrimethamine ) , the results were very promising , with a destruction of approximately 50 % of the intracellular amastigotes , with no detectable toxicity to macrophage cells . SD-P in similar doses did not show good results , probably due to different patterns of drug release . These results open the possibility of treating leishmaniasis with a safe targeted drug of pyrimethamine released directly inside the macrophage cells , reducing the host systemic toxicity .
