Novel , small molecule induced GABA-hATSCs for targeting of neuropathic pain . Recent study showed that ROS has a crucial function during neuropathic pain development and maintenance . In this study , we suggest that a small , novel molecule , CMB-1078 , can effectively induce GABAergic neuronal differentiation from human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells ( hATSCs ; GABA-hATSCs ) , which play a key role in ameliorating neuropathic pain caused by spinal cord injury . Compared to control hATSCs , the engraftment of GABA-hATSCs into animals with neuropathic pain significantly reduced secondary injury , including inflammation , GABAergic neuronal degeneration , and the circulation or propagation of proinflammatory factors cyclooxygenase2 ( P35354 ) , interlukin-1 β ( IL-1β ) , P04839 ( NOX 2 ) , Q9NPH5 ( NOX 4 ) and tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) into the lesion . At the protein level , we also demonstrated that GABA-hATSCs engrafted into animals with neuropathic pain increased glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 ( Q05329 ) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 ( Q99259 ) expression levels . In addition , we evaluated functional pain behavior in the GABA-hATSCs- or control hATSCs-engrafted animal group , the pain in the PBS-infused animal group , and healthy animals by measuring mechanical and heat sensitivity . The pain plus GABA-hATSCs-engrafted animal groups showed paw withdrawal thresholds ( PWTs ) that gradually improved . In contrast , the mice with neuropathic pain did not show improved PWT . Further , the control hATSCs-engrafted animal showed attenuated PWTs . Finally , we suggest that the molecular function of GABA-hATSCs in neuropathic pain may provide potential therapeutic tools for the treatment of pain by controlling the pathology of neuropathic pain through neuroprotection and regeneration .
