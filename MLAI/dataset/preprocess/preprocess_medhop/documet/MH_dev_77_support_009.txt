DB00877 inhibits in vitro growth and release of angiogenetic factors in human bladder cancer . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the in vitro effects of rapamycin in human transitional cell carcinoma and to clarify the possible rapamycin-hypoxia interactions . METHODS : Monolayer cultures of RT112 ( P55008 ) , RT4 ( P55008 -2 ) , T24 ( P46379 ) , and P60880 ( G4 ) cells were incubated in medium with or without rapamycin ( 10 microM , 100 microM ) in different gaseous conditions ( 1 % oxygen plus 5 % carbon dioxide plus 94 % nitrogen or 95 % oxygen plus 5 % carbon dioxide or 21 % oxygen plus 78 % nitrogen ) . Cell vitality and proliferation were determined using the microculture tetrazolium assay . Apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to visualize inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) by rapamycin and synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor . RESULTS : DB00877 delayed proliferation of cancer cell lines but did not induce apoptosis . No direct hypoxia interactions of rapamycin were found . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave evidence of P42345 inhibition in all cell lines and a significant decrease of hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis . CONCLUSIONS : Because proliferation in bladder cancer cells was delayed , but no apoptosis was induced , cell cycle arrest caused by rapamycin was feasible . DB00877 decreased hypoxia-induced synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor . These findings should be substantiated in an animal model to verify the antiangiogenetic effects of rapamycin .
