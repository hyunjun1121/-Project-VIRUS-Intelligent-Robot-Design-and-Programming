[ Genetic polymorphisms and cancer risk ] . While hereditary disease genes have a high lifelong cumulative incidence rate ( penetrance ) , the penetrance for polymorphism genotypes is not high . Polymorphisms relating to cancer incidence are classified into 1. carcinogen metabolizing enzymes ( CYPs , GSTs , P15559 , etc. ) , 2 . DNA repair enzymes ( O15527 , P18887 , P18074 , etc. ) , 3 . DNA synthesis and methylation ( P42898 , MS , etc. ) , 4. cytokines and inflammation-related enzymes ( IL-1B , P01375 -A , P05164 , etc. ) , and 5. sex hormone metabolizing enzymes and the receptors ( P11511 , P31213 , ER , etc. ) . Since genotypes can not be manipulated , they are not the factors subject to prevention . However , the finding that the strength of association between lifestyle and disease occurrence is influenced by genotypes ( gene-environment interaction ) , opens the door to genotype applications for disease prevention practice .
