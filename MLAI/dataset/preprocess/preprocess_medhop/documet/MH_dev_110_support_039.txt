P01308 -like growth factor-1 receptor signaling increases the invasive potential of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing breast cancer cells via Src-focal adhesion kinase and forkhead box protein M1 . Resistance to the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( P04626 ) -targeted antibody trastuzumab is a major clinical concern in the treatment of P04626 -positive metastatic breast cancer . Increased expression or signaling from the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) has been reported to be associated with trastuzumab resistance . However , the specific molecular and biologic mechanisms through which IGF-1R promotes resistance or disease progression remain poorly defined . In this study , we found that the major biologic effect promoted by IGF-1R was invasion , which was mediated by both Src-focal adhesion kinase ( Q05397 ) signaling and Q08050 ( FoxM1 ) . Cotargeting IGF-1R and P04626 using either IGF-1R antibodies or IGF-1R short hairpin RNA in combination with trastuzumab resulted in significant but modest growth inhibition . Reduced invasion was the most significant biologic effect achieved by cotargeting IGF-1R and P04626 in trastuzumab-resistant cells . Constitutively active Src blocked the anti-invasive effect of IGF-1R/ P04626 cotargeted therapy . Furthermore , knockdown of FoxM1 blocked DB01277 -mediated invasion , and dual targeting of IGF-1R and P04626 reduced expression of FoxM1 . Re-expression of FoxM1 restored the invasive potential of IGF-1R knockdown cells treated with trastuzumab . Overall , our results strongly indicate that therapeutic combinations that cotarget IGF-1R and P04626 may reduce the invasive potential of cancer cells that are resistant to trastuzumab through mechanisms that depend in part on Src and FoxM1 .
