Uremic Toxins Induce ET-1 Release by Human Proximal Tubule Cells , which Regulates Organic Cation Uptake Time-Dependently . In renal failure , the systemic accumulation of uremic waste products is strongly associated with the development of a chronic inflammatory state . Here , the effect of cationic uremic toxins on the release of inflammatory cytokines and endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) was investigated in conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells ( ciPTEC ) . Additionally , we examined the effects of ET-1 on the cellular uptake mediated by organic cation transporters ( OCTs ) . Exposure of ciPTEC to cationic uremic toxins initiated production of the inflammatory cytokines P05231 ( 117 ± 3 % , p < 0.001 ) , P10145 ( 122 ± 3 % , p < 0.001 ) , and ET-1 ( 134 ± 5 % , p < 0.001 ) . This was accompanied by a down-regulation of O75051 mediated 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium-iodide ( ASP+ ) uptake in ciPTEC at 30 min ( 23 ± 4 % , p < 0.001 ) , which restored within 60 min of incubation . Exposure to ET-1 for 24 h increased the ASP+ uptake significantly ( 20 ± 5 % , p < 0.001 ) . These effects could be blocked by BQ-788 , indicating activation of an P24530 -receptor-mediated signaling pathway . Downstream the receptor , P35228 inhibition by ( N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine ) l-NMMA acetate or aminoguanidine , as well as protein kinase C activation , ameliorated the short-term effects . These results indicate that uremia results in the release of cytokines and ET-1 from human proximal tubule cells , in vitro . Furthermore , ET-1 exposure was found to regulate proximal tubular O75051 transport activity in a differential , time-dependent , fashion .
