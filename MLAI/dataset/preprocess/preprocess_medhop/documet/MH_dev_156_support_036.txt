Decreased susceptibility to renovascular hypertension in mice lacking the prostaglandin I2 receptor IP . Persistent reduction of renal perfusion pressure induces renovascular hypertension by activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ; however , the sensing mechanism remains elusive . Here we investigated the role of DB01240 in renovascular hypertension in vivo , employing mice lacking the P43119 ( IP-/- mice ) . In WT mice with a two-kidney , one-clip model of renovascular hypertension , the BP was significantly elevated . The increase in BP in IP-/- mice , however , was significantly lower than that in WT mice . Similarly , the increases in plasma renin activity , renal renin mRNA , and plasma aldosterone in response to renal artery stenosis were all significantly lower in IP-/- mice than in WT mice . All these parameters were measured in mice lacking the four DB00917 receptor subtypes individually , and we found that these mice had similar responses to WT mice . DB01240 is produced by P35354 and a selective inhibitor of this enzyme , SC-58125 , also significantly reduced the increases in plasma renin activity and renin mRNA expression in WT mice with renal artery stenosis , but these effects were absent in IP-/- mice . When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was activated by salt depletion , SC-58125 blunted the response in WT mice but not in IP-/- mice . These results indicate that DB01240 derived from P35354 plays a critical role in regulating the release of renin and consequently renovascular hypertension in vivo .
