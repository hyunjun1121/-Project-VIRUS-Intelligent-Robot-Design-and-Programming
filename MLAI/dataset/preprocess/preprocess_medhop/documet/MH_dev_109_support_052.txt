Q13547 ( Q13547 ) participates in the down-regulation of corticotropin releasing hormone gene ( crh ) expression . The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVH ) plays a central role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis . Medial parvocellular neurons of the PVH ( mpPVH ) integrate sensory and humoral inputs to maintain homeostasis . Humoral inputs include glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenals , which down-regulate Q9Y251 activation . A primary glucocorticoid target is the population of mpPVH neurons that synthesize and secrete corticotropin-releasing factors , the most potent of which is corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) . Although P06850 gene ( crh ) expression is known to be down-regulated by glucocorticoids , the mechanisms by which this process occurs are still poorly understood . To begin this study we postulated that glucocorticoid repression of crh involves HDAC recruitment to the region of the crh proximal promoter . To evaluate this hypothesis , we treated hypothalamic cells that express P06850 with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A ( P32119 ) . As predicted , treatment with P32119 led to increased P06850 mRNA levels and crh promoter activity . Although co-treatment with DB00514 ( 10(-7)M ) reduced the P32119 effect on mRNA levels , it failed to reduce promoter activity ; however co-transfection of Q13547 but not 3 restored DB00514 inhibition . A distinction between Q13547 and 3 was also apparent with respect to crh promoter occupancy . DB00514 led to increased Q13547 but not O15379 occupancy . In vivo studies revealed that P06850 -immunoreactive ( -ir ) neurons contained Q13547 - and O15379 -ir . Collectively , these data point to a role for Q13547 in the physiologic regulation of crh .
