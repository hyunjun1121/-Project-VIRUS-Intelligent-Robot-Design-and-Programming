DB01017 inhibits malignant ascites of ovarian cancer through targeting multiple signaling pathways . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effect of minocycline on the expression of cytokines and growth factors responsible for malignant ascite formation . METHODS : In vitro , cells obtained from malignant ascites were pre-treated with minocycline ( 0-100 μmol/L ) and exposed briefly to hypoxia . In vivo , female nude mice bearing OVCAR-3 tumors were treated orally in drinking water with minocycline for 4 weeks . Plasma , ascites , and tumors were analyzed . RESULTS : DB01017 blocked hypoxia-induced surge in interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , its soluble receptor ( sIL-6R ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) levels in concentration-dependent manner . In mice , orally administered minocycline led to dramatic reduction in tumor weight and malignant ascite volume . P05231 , sIL6R and in particular P15692 levels were highly suppressed in plasma , ascite fluid and tumor tissue by minocycline . In addition , tumors from minocycline treated mice expressed profoundly lower levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinases ( p-Erk1/2 ) and p-Akt . DB01017 was also effective at suppressing transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-β1 ) and increasing vascular endothelial cadherin ( P33151 ) expression thereby providing molecular confirmation for its effects on malignant ascite formation . CONCLUSION : Orally administered minocycline is highly effective in suppressing ovarian cancer-induced malignant ascites by targeting cytokines and growth factors essential for tumor growth and malignant ascite formation .
