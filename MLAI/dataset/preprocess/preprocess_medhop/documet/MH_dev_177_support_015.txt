Polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA double-strand break repair pathway and susceptibility to benzene-induced hematotoxicity . Benzene is a recognized hematotoxicant and carcinogen that produces genotoxic damage . DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) are one of the most severe DNA lesions caused directly and indirectly by benzene metabolites . DSB may lead to chromosome aberrations , apoptosis and hematopoietic progenitor cell suppression . We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA DSB repair may modify benzene-induced hematotoxicity . We analyzed one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in each of seven candidate genes ( Q14191 , P04637 , NBS1 , P38398 , P51587 , O43542 and Q13426 ) in a study of 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 controls in China . Four SNPs in Q14191 ( Ex4 -16 G > A , Ex6 +9 C > T , Ex20 -88 G > T and Ex26 -12 T > G ) , one SNP in P04637 ( Ex4 +119 C > G ) and one SNP in P51587 ( Ex11 +1487 A > G ) were associated with a statistically significant decrease in total white blood cell ( WBC ) counts among exposed workers . The SNPs in Q14191 and P04637 remained significant after accounting for multiple comparisons . One or more SNPs in Q14191 had broad effects on WBC subtypes , with significantly decreased granulocyte , total lymphocyte , P01730 (+)-T cell , CD8(+)-T cell and monocyte counts . Haplotypes of Q14191 were associated with decreased WBC counts among benzene-exposed subjects . Likewise , subjects with P04637 Ex4 +119 C > G variant had reduced granulocyte , P01730 (+)-T cell and B cell counts . The effect of P51587 Ex11 +1487 A > G polymorphism was limited to granulocytes . These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in Q14191 , P04637 and P51587 that maintain genomic stability impact benzene-induced hematotoxicity .
