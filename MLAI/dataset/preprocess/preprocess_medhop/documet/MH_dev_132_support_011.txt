A comparison of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the novel antimigraine compound zolmitriptan in adolescents and adults . This open-label , parallel-group study assessed pharmacokinetics and tolerability of zolmitriptan , a P28222 /1D agonist for the acute treatment of migraine , and its active metabolite , 183C91 , in adolescents compared with adults . Twenty-one healthy adolescent and 18 healthy adult volunteers ( with and without history of migraine ) received a single 5-mg dose of zolmitriptan . Mean ages were 14.5 years ( range 12-17 ) for adolescents ( 13 girls , 8 boys ) and Q04695 years ( range 18-65 ) for adults ( 12 women , 6 men ) . The area under the curve ( AUC ) and highest observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of zolmitriptan were similar in both age groups ; the half-life was 3.01 hours in adolescents versus 3.75 hours in adults . The AUC and Cmax of 183C91 , however , were 36 % and 39 % higher in adolescents , respectively ; the half-life was similar in both age groups . Adverse events were similar in both groups in terms of nature , intensity , and frequency . Exposure to zolmitriptan was not significantly different in adolescents compared with adults , but a shorter half-life in adolescents suggests faster elimination in this age group . Exposure to 183C91 was higher in adolescents , suggesting that formation of the metabolite is at least one of the elimination routes of zolmitriptan that occurs at a faster rate in adolescents .
