High mobility group box protein-1 promotes cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury via activation of toll-like receptor 4 . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide . Cerebral edema , a life-threatening medical complication , contributes to elevated intracranial pressure ( ICP ) and a poor clinical prognosis after TBI . Unfortunately , treatment options to reduce post-traumatic edema remain suboptimal , due in part , to a dearth of viable therapeutic targets . Herein , we tested the hypothesis that cerebral innate immune responses contribute to edema development after TBI . Our results demonstrate that high-mobility group box protein 1 ( P09429 ) was released from necrotic neurons via a Q13224 -mediated mechanism . P09429 was clinically associated with elevated ICP in patients and functionally promoted cerebral edema after TBI in mice . The detrimental effects of P09429 were mediated , at least in part , via activation of microglial toll-like receptor 4 ( O00206 ) and the subsequent expression of the astrocytic water channel , aquaporin-4 ( P55087 ) . Genetic or pharmacological ( VGX-1027 ) O00206 inhibition attenuated the neuroinflammatory response and limited post-traumatic edema with a delayed , clinically implementable therapeutic window . Human and rodent tissue culture studies further defined the cellular mechanisms demonstrating neuronal P09429 initiates the microglial release of interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) in a O00206 dependent mechanism . In turn , microglial P05231 increased the astrocytic expression of P55087 . Taken together , these data implicate microglia as key mediators of post-traumatic brain edema and suggest P09429 - O00206 signaling promotes neurovascular dysfunction after TBI .
