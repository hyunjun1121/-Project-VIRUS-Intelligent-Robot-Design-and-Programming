DB00174 Synthetase Deficiency : New Inborn Errors of Metabolism . BACKGROUND : DB00174 synthetase deficiency ( P51689 ) is a newly identified neurometabolic disorder characterized by severe congenital microcephaly , severe global developmental delay , intractable seizure disorder , and spastic quadriplegia . Brain Q9BWK5 showed brain atrophy , delayed myelination , and simplified gyriform pattern . METHODS : We report P51689 deficiency in a 2- and 4-year-old sibling . On them , we described clinical , biochemical , and molecular findings , and we compared our results with previously reported cases . RESULTS : We identified a homozygous novel missense mutation in P08243 gene in both probands and we demonstrated low P04141 and plasma asparagine in both patients . CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should suspect P51689 deficiency in any newborn presented with severe congenital microcephaly followed by severe epileptic encephalopathy and global developmental delay . P04141 asparagine level is low in this disorder while plasma may be low .
