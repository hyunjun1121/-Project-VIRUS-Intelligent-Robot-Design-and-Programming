Antihyperglycemic Activity of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. in DB00428 -Induced Diabetic Rats . Present study is an attempt to investigate plausible mechanism involved behind antidiabetic activity of standardized Houttuynia cordata Thunb. extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats . The plant is used as a medicinal salad for lowering blood sugar level in North-Eastern parts of India . Oral administration of extract at 200 and 400 mg/kg dose level daily for 21 days showed a significant ( P < 0.05 ) decrease in fasting plasma glucose and also elevated insulin level in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats . It also significantly reversed all the alterations in biochemical parameters , that is , total lipid profile , blood urea , creatinine , protein , and antioxidant enzymes in liver , pancreas , and adipose tissue of diabetic rats . Furthermore , we have demonstrated that the extract significantly reversed the expression patterns of various glucose homeostatic enzyme genes like P11168 , P14672 , and caspase-3 levels but did not show any significant effect on Q07869 - Î³ protein expressions . Additionally , the extract positively regulated mitochondrial membrane potential and succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) activity in diabetic rats . The findings justified the antidiabetic effect of H. cordata which is attributed to an upregulation of P14672 and potential antioxidant activity , which may play beneficial role in resolving complication associated with diabetes .
