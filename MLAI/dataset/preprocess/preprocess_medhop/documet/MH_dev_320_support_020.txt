A synthetic dl-nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( Nordy ) , inhibits angiogenesis , invasion and proliferation of glioma stem cells within a zebrafish xenotransplantation model . The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) and their transparent embryos represent a promising model system in cancer research . Compared with other vertebrate model systems , we had previously shown that the zebrafish model provides many advantages over mouse or chicken models to study tumor invasion , angiogenesis , and tumorigenesis . In this study , we systematically investigated the biological features of glioma stem cells ( GSCs ) in a zebrafish model , such as tumor angiogenesis , invasion , and proliferation . We demonstrated that several verified anti-angiogenic agents inhibited angiogenesis that was induced by xenografted-GSCs . We next evaluated the effects of a synthetic dl-nordihydroguaiaretic acid compound ( dl-NDGA or " Nordy " ) , which revealed anti-tumor activity against human GSCs in vitro by establishing parameters through studying its ability to suppress angiogenesis , tumor invasion , and proliferation . Furthermore , our results indicated that Nordy might inhibit GSCs invasion and proliferation through regulation of the arachidonate P09917 ( Alox-5 ) pathway . Moreover , the combination of Nordy and a P15692 inhibitor exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress angiogenesis that was induced by GSCs . By contrast , even following treatment with 50 ÂµM Nordy , there was no discernible effect on zebrafish embryonic development . Together , these results suggested efficacy and safety of using Nordy in vivo , and further demonstrated that this model should be suitable for studying GSCs and anti- P56915 drug evaluation .
