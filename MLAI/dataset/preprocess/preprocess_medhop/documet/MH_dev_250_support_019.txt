Map4k4 suppresses Srebp-1 and adipocyte lipogenesis independent of JNK signaling . Adipose tissue lipogenesis is paradoxically impaired in human obesity , promoting ectopic triglyceride ( TG ) deposition , lipotoxicity , and insulin resistance . We previously identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 ( Map4k4 ) , a sterile 20 protein kinase reported to be upstream of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling , as a novel negative regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes . Using full-genome microarray analysis we uncovered a novel role for Map4k4 as a suppressor of lipid synthesis . We further report here the surprising finding that Map4k4 suppresses adipocyte lipogenesis independently of JNK . Thus , while Map4k4 silencing in adipocytes enhances the expression of lipogenic enzymes , concomitant with increased conversion of (14)C-glucose and (14)C-acetate into TGs and fatty acids , P45983 and P45984 depletion causes the opposite effects . Furthermore , high expression of Map4k4 fails to activate endogenous JNK , while Map4k4 depletion does not attenuate JNK activation by tumor necrosis factor Î± . Map4k4 silencing in cultured adipocytes elevates both the total protein expression and cleavage of sterol-regulated element binding protein-1 ( Srebp-1 ) in a rapamycin-sensitive manner , consistent with Map4k4 signaling via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) . We show Map4k4 depletion requires Srebp-1 upregulation to increase lipogenesis and further show that Map4k4 promotes AMP-protein kinase ( AMPK ) signaling and the phosphorylation of mTORC1 binding partner raptor ( Ser792 ) to inhibit mTORC1 . Our results indicate that Map4k4 inhibits adipose lipogenesis by suppression of Srebp-1 in an AMPK- and P42345 -dependent but JNK-independent mechanism .
