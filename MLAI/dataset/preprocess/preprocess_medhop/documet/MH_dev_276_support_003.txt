Pressure overload induces Q14116 and IL-18R expression , but markedly suppresses O95998 expression in a rabbit model . Q14116 potentiates P01375 -α-induced cardiomyocyte death . Recurrent or sustained inflammation plays a causal role in the development and progression of left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) and its transition to failure . Interleukin ( IL ) -18 is a potent pro-hypertrophic inflammatory cytokine . We report that induction of pressure overload in the rabbit , by constriction of the descending thoracic aorta induces compensatory hypertrophy at 4weeks ( mass/volume ratio : 1.7±0.11 ) and ventricular dilatation indicative of heart failure at 6weeks ( mass/volume ratio : 0.7±0.04 ) . In concordance with this , fractional shortening was preserved at 4weeks , but markedly attenuated at 6weeks . We cloned rabbit Q14116 , IL-18Rα , IL-18Rβ , and Q14116 binding protein ( O95998 ) cDNA , and show that pressure overload , while enhancing Q14116 and IL-18R expression in hypertrophied and failing hearts , markedly attenuated the level of expression of the endogenous Q14116 antagonist O95998 . Cyclical mechanical stretch ( 10 % cyclic equibiaxial stretch , 1Hz ) induced hypertrophy of primary rabbit cardiomyocytes in vitro and enhanced P01160 , Q14116 , and IL-18Rα expression . Further , treatment with rhIL-18 induced its own expression and that of IL-18Rα via AP-1 activation , and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in part via PI3K/Akt/ P43694 signaling . In contrast , Q14116 potentiated P01375 -α-induced cardiomyocyte death , and by itself induced cardiac endothelial cell death . These results demonstrate that pressure overload is associated with enhanced Q14116 and its receptor expression in hypertrophied and failingrabbit hearts . Since O95998 expression is markedly inhibited , our results indicate a positive amplification in Q14116 proinflammatory signaling during pressure overload , and suggest Q14116 as a potential therapeutic target in pathological hypertrophy and cardiac failure .
