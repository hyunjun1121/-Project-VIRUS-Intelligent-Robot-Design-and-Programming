Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing the α6 subunit contribute to ethanol activation of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons . DB00184 and alcohol are often co-abused suggesting a common mechanism of action may underlie their reinforcing properties . Both drugs acutely increase activity of ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) dopaminergic ( DAergic ) neurons , a phenomenon associated with reward behavior . Recent evidence indicates that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) , ligand-gated cation channels activated by ACh and nicotine , may contribute to ethanol-mediated activation of VTA DAergic neurons although the nAChR subtype(s) involved has not been fully elucidated . Here we show that expression and activation of nAChRs containing the α6 subunit contribute to ethanol-induced activation of VTA DAergic neurons . In wild-type ( WT ) mouse midbrain sections that contain the VTA , ethanol ( 50 or 100 mM ) significantly increased firing frequency of DAergic neurons . In contrast , ethanol did not significantly increase activity of VTA DAergic neurons in mice that do not express Q15825 , the gene encoding the α6 nAChR subunit ( α6 knock-out ( KO ) mice ) . DB00898 -induced activity in WT slices was also reduced by pre-application of the α6 subtype-selective nAChR antagonist , α-conotoxin MII[E11A] . When co-applied , ethanol potentiated the response to ACh in WT DAergic neurons ; whereas co-application of ACh and ethanol failed to significantly increase activity of DAergic neurons in α6 KO slices . Finally , pre-application of α-conotoxin MII[E11A] in WT slices reduced ethanol potentiation of ACh responses . Together our data indicate that α6-subunit containing nAChRs may contribute to ethanol activation of VTA DAergic neurons . These receptors are predominantly expressed in DAergic neurons and known to be critical for nicotine reinforcement , providing a potential common therapeutic molecular target to reduce nicotine and alcohol co-abuse .
