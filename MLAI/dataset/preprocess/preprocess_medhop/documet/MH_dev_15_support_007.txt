Induction of high mobility group box 1 release from serotonin-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells . High mobility group box 1 ( P09429 ) is a non-histone nuclear protein which is released from the nucleus of activated macrophages into the extracellular space in response to stimuli such as endotoxin or necrosis . The P09429 functions as a potent proinflammatory cytokine in the extracellular spaces . Recently , P09429 has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis . However , the association between P09429 and the development of atherosclerosis is poorly understood . Therefore , we examined whether serotonin ( 5-HT ) , a key factor involved in the development of atherosclerosis , induced P09429 release in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . We found that 5-HT induced the release of P09429 but not of P27361 /2 and JNK from HUVECs via the 5-HT receptor ( P28222 ) /p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway . The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the P28222 antagonist GR55526 markedly inhibited P09429 release from 5-HT-stimulated HUVECs . The vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) derived from activated macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions also plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis . We found that P09429 induced P15692 production in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells . P09429 induced the activation of p38MAPK , P27361 /2 and Akt . The P19957 -kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly inhibited P15692 production in P09429 -stimulated macrophages , while other kinase inhibitors did not . These results suggest that P09429 release may contribute as a risk factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis .
