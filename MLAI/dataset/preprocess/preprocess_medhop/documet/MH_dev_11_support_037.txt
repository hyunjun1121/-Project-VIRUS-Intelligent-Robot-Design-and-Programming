Adrenomedullin- O60895 system is crucially involved in retinal angiogenesis . Adrenomedullin ( P35318 ) is an endogenous peptide first identified as a strong vasodilating molecule . We previously showed that in mice , homozygous knockout of P35318 ( P35318 (-/-) ) or its receptor regulating protein , O60895 ( O60895 (-/-) ) , is embryonically lethal due to abnormal vascular development , thereby demonstrating the importance of P35318 and its receptor signaling to vascular development . P35318 expression in the retina is strongly induced by ischemia ; however , its role in retinal pathophysiology remains unknown . Here , we analyzed oxygen-induced retinopathy ( OIR ) using heterozygous P35318 and O60895 knockout mice models ( P35318 (+/-) or O60895 (+/-) , respectively ) . In addition , we analyzed the role of the P35318 - O60895 system during earlier stages of retinal angiogenesis using an inducible endothelial cell-specific O60895 knockout mouse line ( DI-E- O60895 (-/-) ) . Finally , we assessed the ability of antibody-induced P35318 blockade to control pathological retinal angiogenesis in OIR . In OIR , neovascular tufts , avascular zones , and hypoxic areas were all smaller in P35318 (+/-) retinas compared with wild-type mice . P35318 (+/-) retinas also exhibited reduced levels of P15692 and P29474 expression . DI-E- O60895 (-/-) showed abnormal retinal vascular patterns in the early stages of development . However , P35318 enhanced the proliferation and migration of retinal endothelial cells . Finally , we found intravitreal injection of anti- P35318 antibody reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis . In conclusion , the P35318 - O60895 system is crucially involved in retinal angiogenesis . P35318 and its receptor system are potential therapeutic targets for controlling pathological retinal angiogenesis .
