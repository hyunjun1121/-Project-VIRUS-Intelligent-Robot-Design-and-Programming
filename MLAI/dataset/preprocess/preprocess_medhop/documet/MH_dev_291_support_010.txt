Optimizing management of treatment-na√Øve and treatment-experienced HIV+ patients : the role of maraviroc . DB04835 is the first P51681 antagonist approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection . It specifically inhibits the replication of R5 viruses by blocking viral entry . HIV-1 tropism can be estimated accurately and predict viral response to maraviroc . Genotypic tools are increasingly replacing phenotypic assays in most places . The favorable pharmacokinetic properties and the good safety profile of maraviroc may support an earlier use of the drug in HIV-1 infection , as well as favor its consideration as part of switch strategies in patients under suppressive antiret-roviral regimens containing less-well-tolerated drugs . Moreover , a particular immune benefit of maraviroc might encourage its use as part of intensification strategies in HIV-infected patients with impaired P01730 gains despite prolonged suppression of HIV replication with antiretroviral therapy . However , the long-term consequences of using maraviroc must be carefully checked , given its particular mechanism of action , blocking a physiologic cell receptor .
