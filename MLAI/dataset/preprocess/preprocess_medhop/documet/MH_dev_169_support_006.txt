[ DB00054 ( ReoPro ) in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes ] . Platelet activation plays a major role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) . Inhibition of platelet function is the basic pharmacological treatment of ACS . P08514 /IIIa inhibitors , a new class of potent antiplatelet agents , have been used in the treatment of ACS and in the prevention of complications after percutaneous coronary interventions ( P05154 ) . Several large clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of this class of agents . The first of these agents to show beneficial effects after coronary interventions was the mouse/human chimeric Fab fragment antibody c7E3 abciximab ( ReoPro ) . The purpose of this article is to describe the pharmacology of abciximab and to review the results of the clinical trials carried out with the drug in patients with ACS , treated either with or without acute/elective P05154 .
