Population studies of polymorphisms at loci of neuropsychiatric interest ( tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) , dopamine transporter protein ( Q01959 ) , D3 dopamine receptor ( P35462 ) , apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) , mu opioid receptor ( P35372 ) , and ciliary neurotrophic factor ( P26441 ) ) . We determined allele frequencies for polymorphisms at several loci of interest in neuropsychiatry-tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) , dopamine transporter protein ( Q01959 ) , D3 dopamine receptor ( P35462 ) , apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) , ciliary neurotrophic factor ( P26441 ) , and the mu opioid receptor ( P35372 ) -in samples of individuals from populations in several different parts of the world . Associations with psychiatric illness have been proposed for specific polymorphisms at P17752 ( suicide-related behaviors and impulsivity ) , P35462 ( schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder ) , Q01959 ( susceptibility to cocaine-induced paranoia and attention-deficit disorder ) , P26441 ( psychosis ) , and P35372 ( substance dependence ) . P02649 alleles are related to risk of Alzheimer disease . We found significant allele frequency variation among populations at all six loci . These results will provide a global framework of normal variation at these loci that might have functional significance or otherwise be related to susceptibility to various disorders or behavioral phenomena . Knowledge of this variation can be important for study design and data interpretation when individuals from various population groups are research subjects and may eventually help lead to a better understanding of behavioral adaptation .
