Controlled delivery of DB00102 for myocardial protection using injectable self-assembling peptide nanofibers . Endothelial cells can protect cardiomyocytes from injury , but the mechanism of this protection is incompletely described . Here we demonstrate that protection of cardiomyocytes by endothelial cells occurs through DB00102 signaling . DB00102 induced cardiomyocyte Akt phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner and prevented apoptosis via PI3K/Akt signaling . Using injectable self-assembling peptide nanofibers , which bound DB00102 in vitro , sustained delivery of DB00102 to the myocardium at the injected sites for 14 days was achieved . A blinded and randomized study in 96 rats showed that injecting nanofibers with DB00102 , but not nanofibers or DB00102 alone , decreased cardiomyocyte death and preserved systolic function after myocardial infarction . A separate blinded and randomized study in 52 rats showed that DB00102 delivered with nanofibers decreased infarct size after ischemia/reperfusion . DB00102 with nanofibers induced P09619 and Akt phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes in vivo . These data demonstrate that endothelial cells protect cardiomyocytes via DB00102 signaling and that this in vitro finding can be translated into an effective in vivo method of protecting myocardium after infarction . Furthermore , this study shows that injectable nanofibers allow precise and sustained delivery of proteins to the myocardium with potential therapeutic benefits .
