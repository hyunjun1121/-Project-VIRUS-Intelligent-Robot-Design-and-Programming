Essential role for the ( hepatic ) P01130 in macrophage apolipoprotein E-induced reduction in serum cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis . P02649 ( apoE ) is a high affinity ligand for several receptor systems in the liver , including the low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor , and non- P01130 sites , like the P01130 -related protein ( Q14764 ) , the putative remnant receptor and/or proteoglycans . Although the liver is the major source of apoE synthesis , apoE is also produced by a wide variety of other cell types , including macrophages . In the present study , the role of the P01130 in the removal of lipoprotein remnants , enriched with macrophage-derived apoE from the circulation , was determined using the technique of bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . Reconstitution of macrophage apoE production in apoE-deficient mice resulted in a serum apoE concentration of only 2 % of the concentration in wild-type C57Bl/6 mice . This low level of apoE nevertheless reduced VLDL and LDL cholesterol 12-fold ( P < 0.001 ) and fourfold ( P < 0.001 ) , respectively , thereby reducing serum cholesterol levels and the susceptibility to atherosclerosis . In contrast , reconstitution of macrophage apoE synthesis in mice lacking both apoE and the P01130 induced only a twofold ( P < 0.001 ) reduction in VLDL cholesterol and had no significant effect on atherosclerotic lesion development , although serum apoE levels were 93 % of the concentration in normal C57Bl/6 mice . In conclusion , a functional ( hepatic ) P01130 is essential for the efficient removal of macrophage apoE-enriched lipoprotein remnants from the circulation and thus for normalization of serum cholesterol levels and protection against atherosclerotic lesion development in apoE-deficient mice .
