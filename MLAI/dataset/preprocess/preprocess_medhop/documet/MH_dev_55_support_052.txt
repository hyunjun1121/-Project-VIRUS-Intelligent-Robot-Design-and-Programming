Thiazolidinediones : effects on insulin resistance and the cardiovascular system . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) have been used for the treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes for the past 10 years . They may delay the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of developing the condition , and have been shown to have potentially beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors . TZDs act as agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) primarily in adipose tissue . P37231 receptor activation by TZDs improves insulin sensitivity by promoting fatty acid uptake into adipose tissue , increasing production of adiponectin and reducing levels of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1( P05121 ) and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) . Clinically , TZDs have been shown to reduce measures of atherosclerosis such as carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) . However , in spite of beneficial effects on markers of cardiovascular risk , TZDs have not been definitively shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients , and the safety of rosiglitazone in this respect has recently been called into question . Dual Q07869 /gamma agonists may offer superior treatment of insulin resistance and cardioprotection , but their safety has not yet been assured .
