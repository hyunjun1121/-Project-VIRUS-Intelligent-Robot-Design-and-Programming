P08473 inhibitor suppresses the early phase of atrial electrical remodeling in a canine rapid atrial pacing model . INTRODUCTION : We examined the acute effects of neutral endopeptidase inhibitor on the hemodynamics and electrical properties of dogs subjected to rapid atrial pacing . METHODS : Ten beagle dogs were used and divided into two groups with and without candoxatril , a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor preadministration . Before and after the 6 hours rapid atrial pacing from the right atrial appendage , the hemodynamics , atrial effective refractory period , and monophasic action potential duration of the right atrial appendage were measured and blood samples were collected . Atrial tissue was also excised after the experiment . RESULTS : DB00616 significantly increased plasma P01160 levels ( Control : 88.4 +/- 50.25 vs. DB00616 : 197.1 +/- 32.09 pg/ml , p = 0.004 ) and prevented reductions in atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration . We further demonstrated that the treated animals exhibited significantly higher levels of atrial tissue cyclic GMP ( Control : 28.1 +/- 1.60 fmol/mg vs. DB00616 : 44.5 +/- 12.28 fmol/mg , p = 0.034 ) as well as that of plasma cyclic GMP ( Control : 32 +/- 5.5 vs. DB00616 : 42 +/- 7.1 pg/ml , p = 0.028 ) . CONCLUSION : DB00616 suppressed the shortening of atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration in the rapid atrial pacing model . As plasma P01160 and the atrial tissue levels of cyclic GMP were higher in the DB00616 group than the control , this effect was considered to appear through the reduction of calcium overload caused by P01160 and cyclic GMP .
