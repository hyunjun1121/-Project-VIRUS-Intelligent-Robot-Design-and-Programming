O14965 regulates O60674 - P40763 activity in human gastric and esophageal cancers . O14965 is a frequently amplified and overexpressed gene in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas ( UGCs ) . Using in vitro cell models of UGCs , we investigated whether O14965 can regulate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( P40763 ) . Our data indicate that overexpression of O14965 in FLO-1 and AGS cells increase P40763 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 site , whereas O14965 genetic depletion by siRNA results in decreased phosphorylation levels of P40763 in FLO-1 and MKN45 cells . Immunofluorescence analysis showed that O14965 overexpression enhanced P40763 nuclear translocation while O14965 genetic knockdown reduced the nuclear translocation of P40763 in AGS and FLO-1 cells , respectively . Using a luciferase reporter assay , we demonstrated that O14965 expression induces transcriptional activity of P40763 . Pharmacological inhibition of O14965 by DB05220 reduced P40763 phosphorylation along with down-regulation of P40763 pro-survival targets , P10415 and Q07820 . Moreover , by using clonogenic cells survival assay , we showed that DB05220 single dose treatment reduced the ability of FLO-1 and AGS cells to form colonies . Additional experiments utilizing cell models of overexpression and knockdown of O14965 indicated that P40763 upstream non-receptor tyrosine kinase O60674 ( O60674 ) is mediating the effect of O14965 on P40763 . The inhibition of O60674 using O60674 -specific inhibitor AZD1480 or siRNA knockdown , in presence of O14965 overexpression , abrogated the O14965 -mediated P40763 activation . These results confirm that the O14965 - O60674 axis is the main mechanism by which O14965 regulates P40763 activity . In conclusion , we report , for the first time , that O14965 promotes P40763 activity through regulating the expression and phosphorylation levels of O60674 . This highlights the importance of targeting O14965 as a therapeutic approach to treat gastric and esophageal cancers .
