P10275 in Sertoli cells is not required for testosterone-induced suppression of spermatogenesis , but contributes to Sertoli cell organization in Utp14b jsd mice . DB00624 acting through the androgen receptor ( AR ) maintains the arrest of spermatogonial differentiation in juvenile spermatogonial depletion ( jsd mutation in the Utp14b gene ) mutant adult male mice . It is not known which of the somatic cell types expressing AR mediates this inhibition . To determine whether Sertoli cells are responsible , we selectively eliminated AR in Sertoli cells in jsd mice containing a floxed-Ar gene and an anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone-Cre transgene . In these Sertoli AR-knockout ( SCARKO ) -jsd mice , spermatogonial differentiation did not recover . However , the normal organization of Sertoli cell nuclei was drastically disrupted in SCARKO-jsd mice compared with SCARKO or jsd mice . In addition , the extent of ectoplasmic specializations was reduced ; tight junctions were not found ; vinculin , an anchoring protein found in ectoplasmic specializations , became uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm ; and the adult Sertoli cells showed excess heterochromatin subjacent to their nuclear envelope . Despite the abnormalities in Sertoli cells in SCARKO-jsd mice , global suppression of testosterone action and levels was still effective in restoring the differentiated germ cells , and this was accompanied by an improved arrangement of Sertoli cell nuclei . We conclude that Sertoli cells are not targets for the testosterone-mediated inhibition of spermatogonial differentiation in jsd mice , and that both AR in Sertoli cells and the presence of differentiated germ cells contribute to maintaining the organization of Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules .
