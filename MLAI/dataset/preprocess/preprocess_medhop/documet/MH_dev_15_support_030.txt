In-vitro antiproliferative activities and kinase inhibitory potencies of meridianin derivatives . Marine alkaloid meridianin G derivatives , substituted on the pyrimidine ring by aryl groups , were evaluated for their kinase inhibitory potencies and their in-vitro antiproliferative activities . The derivatives were tested toward a panel of nine protein kinases ( P35968 , IGF-1R , c- DB00134 , P07949 , c-Src , c-Abl , PKA , P24941 /cyclin A , and HER-1 ) and their in-vitro antiproliferative activities were evaluated toward a human fibroblast primary culture and two human solid cancer cell lines ( MCF-7 and PA 1 ) . Despite weak kinase inhibitory potencies , high in-vitro antiproliferative activities were found for compounds 5 , 7 , 12 , and 14 , which do not interfere with the PA 1 cell cycle and may be considered as direct cytolysis or apoptosis inducers .
