Resistance of P04626 /neu-overexpressing tumor targets to lymphokine-activated-killer-cell-mediated lysis : evidence for deficiency of binding and post-binding events . P04626 /neu-overexpressing tumor cell lines are relatively resistant to lymphokine-activated killer ( Q96QP1 ) cell cytotoxicity when compared to P04626 /neu-nonexpressing lines . P04626 /neu+ targets were also resistant to binding by Q96QP1 large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) as shown by visualization at the single-cell level , a target monolayer binding assay and in " cold " target inhibition experiments . P04626 /neu+ Q96QP1 -resistant ovarian cell lines demonstrated an absence of P05362 expression while expression of LFA-3 , N- P62158 , laminin and beta 1 integrins was comparable to that of P04626 /neu- targets . In contrast , the P04626 /neu+ breast cell line , SKBR-3 , which was also resistant to lysis and binding by Q96QP1 LGL , demonstrated normal expression of P05362 . Anti- P05362 antibodies blocked binding and lysis of P04626 /neu- carcinoma targets by Q96QP1 cells , further supporting the notion that lack of P05362 expression on P04626 /neu+ cells contributes to their resistance . The modest binding and lysis of P04626 /neu+ targets by Q96QP1 cells was significantly inhibited by anti-LFA-1 antibodies , suggesting the existence of another counter-receptor for LFA-1 on P04626 /neu+ targets . The following also supported deficiencies in post-binding events when P04626 /neu+ cells resisted the lytic activity of Q96QP1 cells : ( a ) when the relative resistance to effector cell binding was overcome by exogenous lectin . P04626 /neu+ cell lines were still resistant to Q96QP1 cytolysis , and ( b ) P04626 /neu+ targets were resistant to perforin-containing granule extracts obtained from the CTLL-R8 cytotoxic lymphocyte cell line . These results indicate that deficiency in effector binding as well as post-binding events contributes to the resistance of P04626 /neu-overexpressing tumor targets to Q96QP1 -cell-mediated lysis .
