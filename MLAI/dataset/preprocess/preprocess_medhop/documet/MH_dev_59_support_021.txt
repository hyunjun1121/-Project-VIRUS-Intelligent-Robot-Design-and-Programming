Branched N-glycans and their implications for cell adhesion , signaling and clinical applications for cancer biomarkers and in therapeutics . Branched N-glycans are produced by a series of glycosyltransferases including N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases and fucosyltransferases and their corresponding genes . Glycans on specific glycoproteins , which are attached via the action of glycosyltransferases , play key roles in cell adhesion and signaling . Examples of this are adhesion molecules or signaling molecules such as integrin and P12830 , as well as membrane receptors such as the P01133 and TGFÎ² receptors . These molecules also play pivotal roles in the underlying mechanism of a variety of disease such as cancer metastasis , diabetes , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . Alterations in the structures of branched N-glycans are also hall marks and are useful for cancer biomarkers and therapeutics against cancer . This mini-review describes some of our recent studies on a functional glycomics approach to the study of branched N-glycans produced by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases III , IV , V and IX ( Vb ) ( GnT-III , GnT-IV , V and IX ( Vb ) ) and fucosyltransferase 8 ( Fut8 ) and their patho-physiological significance , with emphasis on the importance of a systems glycobiology approach as a future perspective for glycobiology .
