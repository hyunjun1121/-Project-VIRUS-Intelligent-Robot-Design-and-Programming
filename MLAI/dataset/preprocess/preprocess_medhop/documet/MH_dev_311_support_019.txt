Array-comparative genomic hybridization to detect genomewide changes in microdissected primary and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinomas . Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is a common worldwide malignancy . However , it is unclear what , if any , genomic alterations occur as the disease progresses to invasive and metastatic OSCC . This study used genomewide array-CGH in microdissected specimens to map genetic alterations found in primary OSCC and neck lymph node metastases . We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( array-CGH ) to screen genomewide alterations in eight pairs of microdissected tissue samples from primary and metastatic OSCC . In addition , 25 primary and metastatic OSCC tissue pairs were examined with immunohistochemistry for protein expression of the most frequently altered genes . The highest frequencies of gains were detected in P12524 , Q04864 , TERC , P42336 , P10242 , P08183 , P01112 , GARP , P30279 , P07332 , P04626 , P01127 , and Q05066 . The highest frequencies of losses were detected in p44S10 , O15164 , P06858 , Q13126 , P35226 , P11161 , and Q13163 . Genomic alterations in TGFbeta2 , cellular retinoid-binding protein 1 gene ( P09455 ) , P42336 , P28222 , P01112 , P21860 , and O14965 differed significantly between primary OSCC and their metastatic counterparts . Genomic alterations in Q05513 , P00519 , and P08620 were significantly different in patients who died compared with those who survived . Immunohistochemistry confirmed high P42336 immunoreactivity in primary and metastatic OSCC . Higher P08620 immunoreactivity in primary OSCC is associated with a worse prognosis . Loss of P09455 immunoreactivity is evident in primary and metastatic OSCC . Our study suggests that precise genomic profiling can be useful in determining gene number changes in OSCC . As our understanding of these changes grow , this profiling may become a practical tool for clinical evaluation .
