Central neuropeptide Y enhances bile secretion through vagal and muscarinic but not nitric oxide pathways in rats . Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) acts in the central nervous system to regulate gastrointestinal functions in rats and dogs . The effects of intracisternal injection of P01303 on bile secretion and biliary components were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats with bile duct cannula . Intracisternal P01303 ( 0.02-0.12 nmol ) dose-dependently increased bile secretion by 9. P98173 .5 % . The secretory response occurred within the first 20-40 min and lasted for the 120-min observation period . Intravenous injection of P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) did not modify bile secretion under identical conditions . Biliary bile acid , phospholipid , and cholesterol secretion were not modified by intracisternal injection of P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) , whereas bicarbonate was increased by 19.0 +/- 1.7 % from 40 to 120 min after P01303 injection . Cervical cord transection at the P13671 level , acute bilateral adrenalectomy ( -120 min ) , or injection of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( 10 mg/kg , IV , -15 min ) , an inhibitor of nitric oxide biosynthesis , did not alter intracisternal P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) -induced stimulation of bile secretion . Atropine ( 2.0 mg/kg , IP , -30 min ) and bilateral cervical vagotomy ( -120 min ) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of intracisternal P01303 ( 0.12 nmol ) on bile secretion . These findings indicate that P01303 acts in the brain to stimulate bicarbonate-dependent bile secretion through vagal and muscarinic pathways and suggest that peptides in the central nervous system may be involved in the vagal regulation of bile secretion .
