Sporadic breast carcinomas with somatic P38398 gene deletions share genotype/phenotype features with familial breast carcinomas . BACKGROUND : High frequencies of loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) are found in familial breast carcinomas with BRCA mutations . Although LOH of P38398 does not coincide with somatic P38398 mutations , reduced P38398 protein expression and hypermethylation indicate the involvement of P38398 in sporadic carcinogenesis . To further investigate the role of BRCA we determined LOH of P38398 and correlated this with LOH in other breast cancer-associated regions . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 105 sporadic breast carcinomas were analysed for LOH in the regions of P38398 , P51587 , P04637 , Caveolin1 , " putative BRCA3 " , P60484 , Q13315 and P12830 and correlated it with clinicopathological features . RESULTS : We found an overall increase of LOH in carcinomas with simultaneous LOH of P38398 . Significantly higher LOH rates were detected in the regions of P04637 ( 80 % : 34.7 % ; p < 0.005 ) , 8q21 ( 72.7 % : 30.6 % ; p < 0.010 ) and 10q22-23 ( 21.1 % : 5.9 % ; p=0.043 ) . Moreover , estrogen receptor-negative carcinomas revealed LOH of P38398 more frequently than estrogen receptor-positive carcinomas ( 39 % : 12 % ; p=0.003 ) . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that LOH of P38398 coincides with a defect of the DNA repair pathway . Therefore , LOH of P38398 determines a subgroup of sporadic breast carcinomas sharing genotype/phenotype features with familial breast carcinomas .
