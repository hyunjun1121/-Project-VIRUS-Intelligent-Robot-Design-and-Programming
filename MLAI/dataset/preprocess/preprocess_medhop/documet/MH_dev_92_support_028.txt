Both the ADP receptors P47900 and Q9H244 , play a role in controlling shape change in human platelets . Two types of ADP receptors , P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) are involved in platelet aggregation . The P2X(1) receptor is also present but its role , in terms of platelet function , is not yet defined . The aim of this study was to establish if the ADP receptors , P2Y ( 1 , ) P2Y(12) and P2X(1) play a role in controlling platelet shape change ( PSC ) in human platelets . PSC is an early phase of platelet activation that precedes aggregation . Using a high-resolution channelyzer , PSC was assessed by measuring the median platelet volume ( MPV ) . The P2Y(1) receptor antagonist P59665 2179 ( 1.06 - 10.25 micro mol/l ) blocked ADP-induced PSC ( by 100 % ) . The median IC(50) was 3.16 micro mol/l . P59665 2179 also significantly ( P = 0.01 ) inhibited PSC induced by the combination of ADP + serotonin ( 5HT ) . The P2Y(12) receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX significantly inhibited ( at 10s , P = 0.009 ; 15 s , P = 0.001 and 30 s , P = 0.015 ) ADP-induced PSC . The P2X(1) receptor antagonist TNP- DB00171 had no significant effect on ADP- or ADP + 5HT-induced PSC . We conclude that the IC(50) of a P2Y(1)-blocker can be derived because of the high-resolution and reproducibility of the channelyzer technique . In addition to the P2Y(1) purinoceptor , the P2Y(12)receptor appears to be involved in ADP-induced PSC since this process was significantly inhibited by AR-C69931MX . The channelyzer technique may be more reliable than optical aggregometry to assess PSC .
