Cortical neurons from intrauterine growth retardation rats exhibit lower response to neurotrophin P23560 . Intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) is putatively involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . The animal model of IUGR induced by synthetic thromboxane A2 ( TXA2 ) is useful to clarify the effect of IUGR on pups ' brains , however , analysis at the cellular level is still needed . P23560 ( P23560 ) , which plays a role in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , may also be associated with schizophrenia . However , the possible relationship between IUGR and P23560 function remains unclear . Here , we examined how IUGR by TXA2 impacts P23560 function by using dissociated cortical neurons . We found that , although P23560 levels in cultured neurons from the cerebral cortex of low birth weight pups with IUGR were unchanged , TrkB ( P23560 receptor ) was decreased compared with control-rats . P23560 -stimulated MAPK/ P27361 /2 and PI3K/Akt pathways , which are downstream intracellular signaling pathways of TrkB , were repressed in IUGR-rat cultures . Expression of glutamate receptors such as P42261 and Q12879 was also suppressed in IUGR-rat cultures . Furthermore , in IUGR-rat cultures , anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 was decreased and P23560 failed to prevent neurons from cell death caused by serum-deprivation . Taken together , IUGR resulted in reductions in cell viability and in synaptic function following TrkB down-regulation , which may play a role in schizophrenia-like behaviors .
