Personalised intervention for people with depression and severe P48444 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) is often complicated by depression and exemplifies the challenge in managing chronic illnesses that require active patient participation in care . In a clinical trial ( NCT00151372 ) , we compared a novel personalised intervention for depression and P48444 ( PID-C ) targeting treatment adherence with treatment as usual ( P10636 ) . In 138 patients with major depression and severe P48444 , PID-C led to a higher remission rate and a greater reduction in depressive symptoms and in dyspnoea-related disability than P10636 over 28 weeks and 6 months after the last session . If replicated , PID-C may serve as a care model for patients with both depression and medical illnesses with a deteriorating course .
