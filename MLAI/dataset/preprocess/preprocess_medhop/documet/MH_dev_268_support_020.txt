Distinct signalling pathways of murine histamine H1- and H4-receptors expressed at comparable levels in HEK293 cells . DB11320 ( HA ) is recognized by its target cells via four G-protein-coupled receptors , referred to as histamine H1-receptor ( P35367 ) , P25021 , Q9Y5N1 , and Q9H3N8 . Both P35367 and Q9H3N8 exert pro-inflammatory functions . However , their signal transduction pathways have never been analyzed in a directly comparable manner side by side . Moreover , the analysis of pharmacological properties of the murine orthologs , representing the main targets of pre-clinical research , is very important . Therefore , we engineered recombinant HEK293 cells expressing either mouse (m) P35367 or mH4R at similar levels and analyzed HA-induced signalling in these cells . HA induced intracellular calcium mobilization via both mH1R and mH4R , with the mH1R being much more effective . Whereas DB02527 accumulation was potentiated via the mH1R , it was reduced via the mH4R . The regulation of both second messengers via the Q9H3N8 , but not the P35367 , was sensitive to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) . The mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) P29323 1/2 were massively activated downstream of both receptors and demonstrated a functional involvement in HA-induced P18146 gene expression . The p38 MAPK was moderately activated via both receptors as well , but was functionally involved in HA-induced P18146 gene expression only in Q9H3N8 -expressing cells . Surprisingly , in this system p38 MAPK activity reduced the HA-induced gene expression . In summary , using this system which allows a direct comparison of mH1R- and mH4R-induced signalling , qualitative and quantitative differences on the levels of second messenger generation and also in terms of p38 MAPK function became evident .
