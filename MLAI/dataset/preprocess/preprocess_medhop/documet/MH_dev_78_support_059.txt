[ Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 selective inhibitors : aspirin , a dual P23219 / P35354 inhibitor , to P35354 selective inhibitors ] . DB00945 was developed as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) in 1899 . During the century after that , aspirin has been found to show its anti-inflammatory , analgesic and anti-pyretic activities by reducing prostaglandins biosynthesis through inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) ; and then P36551 was found to be constituted of two isoforms , constitutive P23219 and inducible P35354 . Currently , novel NSAIDs , acting through selective inhibition of P35354 , that have efficacy as excellent as aspirin with significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects are available in America and some other countries , but not in Japan . Physiological and pathophysiological roles of P23219 and P35354 have been explained from studies in experimental animals , but there are many differences in species and diseases between animals and humans . Thus , physiological and pathophysiological roles of P35354 were considered from the standpoint of clinical effects of the two latest P35354 selective inhibitors , celecoxib and rofecoxib , on inflammation , pain , fever and colorectal cancer together with their adverse effects on gastrointestinal , renal and platelet functions ; and the usefulness and limits of P35354 -selective inhibitors were discussed with the trends of new NSAIDs development .
