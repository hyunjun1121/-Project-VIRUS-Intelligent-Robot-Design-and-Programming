Herpes simplex virus infection causes cellular beta-amyloid accumulation and secretase upregulation . It is uncertain whether environmental factors contribute to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , the abnormal features that define the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain . We previously proposed that herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV1 ) is a strong risk factor for AD when it is present in the brains of people who possess the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene ( P02649 -epsilon4 ) ; however a direct biochemical link between viral infection and the development of the AD pathological features has never previously been examined . Here we show that infection of cultured neuronal and glial cells with HSV1 leads to a dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) 1-40 and 1-42 , whilst levels of amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) in cells decrease . Similarly , Abeta1-42 deposits are present in mouse brain after HSV1 infection . In the cultured cells the mechanism involves increased Abeta production , rather than merely greater retention of cellular Abeta , as levels of beta-site P05067 -cleaving enzyme ( P56817 -1 ) and of nicastrin , a component of gamma-secretase , both increase in HSV1-infected cells . These novel data show that HSV1 can directly contribute to the development of senile plaques .
