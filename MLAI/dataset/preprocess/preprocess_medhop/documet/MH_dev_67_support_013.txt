Biphasic action of cyclic adenosine 3',5'- monophosphate in gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) analog-stimulated hormone release from GH3 cells stably transfected with P30968 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid . GH3 cells are a PRL-secreting adenoma cell line derived from pituitary lactotropes . These cells have been stably transfected with rat P30968 complementary DNA to produce four cell lines : Q92820 (3)1 ' , Q92820 (3)2 ' , Q92820 (3)6 ' , and Q92820 (3)12 ' . In response to either DB00644 or DB06719 ( a metabolically stable DB00644 agonist ) , these cell lines synthesize PRL in a DB02527 -dependent manner . Only Q92820 (3)6 ' cells desensitize in response to persistent treatment with 10(-7) g/ml DB06719 . Q92820 (3)1 ' , Q92820 (3)2 ' , and Q92820 (3)12 ' cells , however , can be made refractory to DB06719 stimulation by raising DB02527 levels either by the addition of (Bu)2cAMP to the medium or by treatment with cholera toxin . In Q92820 (3) cells , low levels of DB02527 fulfill the requirements for a second messenger , whereas higher levels appear to mediate the development of desensitization . The observation that in Q92820 (3)6 ' cells , DB02527 production persists after the onset of desensitization is consistent with the view that the mechanism responsible for desensitization is distal to the production of DB02527 . Moreover , the absence of any significant difference in the amount of DB02527 produced per cell in Q92820 (3)2 ' , Q92820 (3)6 ' , or Q92820 (3)12 ' cells suggests that elevated DB02527 production per cell does not explain the development of desensitization in Q92820 (3)6 ' cells . We suggest that DB06719 -stimulated PRL synthesis in Q92820 (3)6 ' cells is mediated by a different DB02527 -dependent protein kinase pool(s) than that in nondesensitizing Q92820 (3) cells . Such a protein kinase A pool(s) may be more susceptible to degradation via DB02527 -mediated mechanisms than the protein kinase pools mediating the DB06719 response in nondesensitizing Q92820 (3) cells . A similar mechanism has been reported in other systems .
