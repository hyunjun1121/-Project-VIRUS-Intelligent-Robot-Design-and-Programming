P14780 and urokinase plasminogen activator mediate interleukin-1-induced neurotoxicity . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are endopeptidases known to mediate acute neuronal injury , but it is unclear whether these proteases are induced by the primary insult or by inflammation associated with injury . We have reported recently that interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) induces neurotoxicity by an astrocyte-dependent mechanism . The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that MMPs mediate IL-1 neurotoxicity in rat , glial-neuronal cocultures . IL-1beta induced the release of astrocytic P14780 in cocultures , whilst an antagonist of P14780 inhibited IL-1beta-induced neuronal death . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) was constitutively expressed on neuronal membrane fractions , and amiloride ( an antagonist of uPA ) or plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 significantly reduced IL-1beta-induced neurotoxicity . Thus , neuronal uPA contributes to IL-1 neurotoxicity , and may be responsible for activating P14780 released from IL-1-primed astrocytes . In summary , IL-1-induced neurotoxicity is dependent on extracellular protease activity , and these mechanisms may contribute to neuronal cell death in CNS diseases .
