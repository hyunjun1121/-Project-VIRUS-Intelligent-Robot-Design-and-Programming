Gene expression profiles of adipose tissue of obese rats after central administration of neuropeptide Y- Q15761 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides by cDNA microarrays . To investigate the gene expression profiles of adipose tissue of obese rats after central administration of neuropeptide Y- Q15761 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) , Q15761 antisense , mismatched ODNs or vehicle was intracerebroventricularly injected and cDNA microarrays were undertaken . Central administration of Q15761 antisense ODNs decreased food intake , body weight and serum insulin compared with both vehicle and mismatched ODNs . The average area of adipocytes both at retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissue were fall in antisense group while only the weight of the retroperitoneal fat pats was reduced in antisense group . cDNA microarrays containing 18,000 genes/Ests were used to investigate gene expression of adipose tissue . Autoradiographic analysis showed that 404 , 81 , and 34 genes were differently expressed over twofold , threefold , and fivefold , respectively . The analysis of gene expression profiles indicated that 332 genes were up-regulated and 187 genes were down-regulated in response to Q15761 antisense ODNs treatment . Different clusters of genes associated with apoptosis , signal transduction , energy metabolism , lipid metabolism , etc. , such as P51114 , Q8WV24 , Q7L5Y9 , P27986 , P13598 , Q00169 , P62158 , Q13557 , P61925 , P14416 , O95258 , CKB , P22760 , P38571 , O15254 , O60427 , were concerned . Analysis of differentially expressed genes will help to understand the effects of Q15761 antisense ODNs therapy .
