Positive effects of methylphenidate on hyperactivity are moderated by monoaminergic gene variants in children with autism spectrum disorders . Methylphenidate ( DB00422 ) reduces hyperactive-impulsive symptoms common in children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) , however , response and tolerability varies widely . We hypothesized monoaminergic gene variants may moderate DB00422 effects in P51689 , as in typically developing children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder . Genotype data were available for 64 children with P51689 and hyperactivity who were exposed to DB00422 during a 1-week safety/tolerability lead-in phase and 58 who went on to be randomized to placebo and three doses of DB00422 during a 4-week blinded , crossover study . Outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement ( CGI-I ) scale and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC-hyperactivity index ) . A total of 14 subjects discontinued the study because of DB00422 side effects . Subjects were genotyped for variants in P21728 - P21918 , P08913 , Q01959 , P31645 , P21397 and P27338 , and P21964 . Forty-nine percent of the sample met positive responder criteria . In this modest but relatively homogeneous sample , significant differences by P21728 ( P=0.006 ) , P08913 ( P < 0.02 ) , P21964 ( P < 0.04 ) , P35462 ( P < 0.05 ) , P21917 ( P < 0.05 ) , Q01959 ( P < 0.05 ) and P31645 ( P < 0.05 ) genotypes were found for responders versus non-responders . Variants in P14416 ( P < 0.001 ) and P35462 ( P < 0.04 ) were associated with tolerability in the 14 subjects who discontinued the trial . For this first DB00422 pharmacogenetic study in children with P51689 , multiple monoaminergic gene variants may help explain individual differences in DB00422 's efficacy and tolerability .
