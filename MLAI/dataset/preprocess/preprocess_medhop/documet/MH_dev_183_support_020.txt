DB04864 ameliorates cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats . The present study was designed to probe the effects of DB04864 ( HupA ) on diabetes-associated cognitive decline ( DACD ) using a streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -injected rat model . Diabetic rats were treated with HupA ( 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg ) for seven weeks . Memory functions were evaluated by the water maze test . Nissl staining was selected for detecting neuronal loss . Protein and mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) were analyzed by ELISA and real-time PCR , respectively . The activities of choline acetylase ( P28329 ) , P22303 ( P22303 ) , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , glutathione peroxidase ( DB00143 -Px ) , catalase ( CAT ) , NF-κB p65 unit , P01375 -α , IL-1β , P05231 and caspase-3 were measured using corresponding kits . After seven weeks , diabetic rats exhibited remarkable reductions in : body weight , percentage of time spent in target quadrant , number of times crossing the platform , P28329 and P23560 levels , SOD , DB00143 -Px and CAT accompanied with increases in neuronal damage , plasma glucose levels , escape latency , mean path length , P22303 , MDA level as well as CAT , NF-κB p65 unit , P01375 -α , IL-1β , P05231 and caspase-3 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus . Supplementation with HupA significantly and dose-dependently reversed the corresponding values in diabetes . It is concluded that HupA ameliorates DACD via modulating P23560 , oxidative stress , inflammation and apoptosis .
