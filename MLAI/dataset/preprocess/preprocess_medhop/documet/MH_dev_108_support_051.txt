Tumor necrosis factors blocking agents : analogies and differences . Five anti- P01375 agents , infliximab , adalimumab , etanercept , DB06674 and certolizumab pegol are approved worldwide for the treatment of RA . Anti- P01375 agents , bind to and neutralize soluble P01375 , but exert different effects on transmembrane P01375 -expressing cells ( P01375 -producing cells ) . Differences on affinity and avidity for soluble and transmembrane P01375 were showed . Different activity on cells apoptosis , complement-dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( Q15848 ) were described . Some dramatic changes in gene expression were seen with all the anti-TNFs . Reviewing the biology of transmembrane P01375 and its interaction with anti- P01375 agents will contribute to understanding the bases of differential clinical efficacy of these promising treatment modalities .
