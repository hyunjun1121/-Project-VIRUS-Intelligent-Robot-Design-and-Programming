Differential effects of amfonelic acid on the haloperidol- and clozapine-induced increase in extracellular DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum . This study compares the effects of the nonamphetamine stimulant amfonelic acid on the increase in extracellular 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ( DOPAC ) induced by haloperidol and clozapine in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum of anaesthetized rats . DOPAC was simultaneously recorded in both regions using differential pulse voltammetry with electrically pretreated carbon fibre electrodes . Amfonelic acid ( 2.5 mg/kg s.c. ) did not alter basal striatal DOPAC but produced a significant reduction in extracellular DOPAC in the nucleus accumbens . DB00502 ( 1 mg/kg s.c. ) increased extracellular DOPAC in both regions . When amfonelic acid was injected 5 min before haloperidol , the increase in DOPAC was potentiated in both the nucleus accumbens and the striatum but with a greater effect in the striatum . Clozapine ( 30 mg/kg i.p. ) increased extracellular DOPAC in both regions , an effect partially attenuated by amfonelic acid in both regions but to a greater extent in the striatum . When ritanserin ( 5 mg/kg i.p. ) , a serotonergic antagonist ( P28223 ) , was co-administered with haloperidol , the potentiation by amfonelic acid of the increase in extracellular DOPAC induced by haloperidol was attenuated in both the nucleus accumbens and the striatum . The present results confirm that amfonelic acid can be used to discriminate neurochemically between haloperidol and clozapine in vivo . The effects of amfonelic acid on the neuroleptic-induced changes in extracellular DOPAC were greater in the striatum than the nucleus accumbens . These results further demonstrate that both neuroleptics increase dopamine metabolism in the two brain regions but by different mechanisms , supporting the view that the regulation of dopamine metabolism differs in the two regions.
