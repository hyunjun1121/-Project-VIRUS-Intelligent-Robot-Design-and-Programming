Regulation and therapeutic targeting of peptide-activated receptor guanylyl cyclases . Cyclic GMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates a wide array of physiologic processes such as blood pressure , long bone growth , intestinal fluid secretion , phototransduction and lipolysis . Soluble and single-membrane-spanning enzymes called guanylyl cyclases ( GC ) synthesize cGMP . In humans , the latter group consists of P16066 , P20594 , P25092 , GC-E and P51841 , which are also known as P16066 , P20594 , StaR , Ret1-GC and Ret2-GC , respectively . Membrane GCs are activated by peptide ligands such as atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , B-type natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) , P23582 ( P09543 ) , guanylin , uroguanylin , heat stable enterotoxin and GC-activating proteins . DB04899 and carperitide are clinically approved peptide-based drugs that activate P16066 . CD-NP is an experimental heart failure drug that primarily activates P20594 but also activates P16066 at high concentrations and is resistant to degradation . Inactivating mutations in P20594 cause acromesomelic dysplasia type Maroteaux dwarfism and chromosomal mutations that increase P09543 concentrations are associated with Marfanoid-like skeletal overgrowth . Pump-based P09543 infusions increase skeletal growth in a mouse model of the most common type of human dwarfism , which supports P09543 / P20594 -based therapies for short stature diseases . DB08890 is a peptide activator of P25092 that stimulates intestinal motility and is in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of chronic constipation . This review discusses the discovery of cGMP , guanylyl cyclases , the general characteristics and therapeutic applications of P16066 , P20594 and P25092 , and emphasizes the regulation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases by phosphorylation and DB00171 .
