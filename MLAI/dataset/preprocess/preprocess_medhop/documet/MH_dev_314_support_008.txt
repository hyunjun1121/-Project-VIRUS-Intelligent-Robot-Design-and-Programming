DB00115 is a strong determinant of low methionine synthase activity and DNA hypomethylation in gastrectomized rats . BACKGROUND/AIMS : The respective influence of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency on Q99707 activity and transcription , and on DNA methylation is not clearly established . The aim of this study was to assess the respective influence of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency on Q99707 transcription and activity , and on DNA methylation . METHODS : Sixty-one rats were administered normal diet or diet deficient in choline , methionine , folic acid and vitamin B12 . Forty-seven of them underwent total gastrectomy or ileal resection . RESULTS : Low vitamin B12 was observed only in gastrectomized rats . Low folate was observed in rats under deficient diet . Total Q99707 activity ( holo- + apoenzyme ) was lowered only with vitamin B12 level < 200 pmol/l ( p=0.0002 ) , while the ratios of total vs. holo- Q99707 activity and of transcripts Q99707 vs. P04406 ( RT-PCR ) were unchanged . DB00115 was the single determinant of low Q99707 ( lower quartile , odds ratio=15.75 , p=0.0017 ) . Low Q99707 and low vitamin B12 were the two determinants of DNA hypomethylation ( lower quartile ) ( odds ratio=17.07 , p=0.0006 , and odds ratio=7.31 , p=0.006 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : DB00115 affects Q99707 expression by a non-transcriptional mechanism different from a protective effect on Q99707 proteolysis . It is also a strong determinant of DNA hypomethylation .
