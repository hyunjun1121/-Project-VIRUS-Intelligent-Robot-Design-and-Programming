Multiple structural determinants of voltage-dependent magnesium block in recombinant DB01221 receptors . The voltage-dependent block of DB01221 channels by Mg2+ is an important functional element of DB01221 receptors , since relief of block by depolarization plays a key role in some forms of ischemic neurodegeneration and synaptic plasticity . To identify the relevant structural domains responsible for block by Mg2+ and DB01520 , we used site-directed mutagenesis to change individual amino acids of the rat NR1A subunit in a transmembrane region ( 599-DALTLSSAMWFSWGVLLNSGIGE-621 , mutated residues underlined ) previously shown to donate residues that influence ionic selectivity . Ten mutant NR1A subunits were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with either the epsilon 1 or Q12879 subunits , and receptor properties were analyzed under two-electrode voltage clamp . The mutation N616R virtually abolished voltage-dependent Mg2+ block , reduced DB01593 block 5-fold and greatly reduced Ba2+ permeability in confirmation of previous reports . This mutation also reduced the potency of DB01520 as a use-dependent blocker by 200-fold . The remaining low-affinity DB01520 block did not appear to be use-dependent , suggesting two blocking sites for DB01520 . None of the other mutations differed significantly from NR1A itself except S617N , which displayed a 6-fold reduction in Mg2+ block . A well-barrier model of permeation through the DB01221 receptor channel is presented that quantitatively reproduces voltage-dependent Mg2+ block . This model demonstrates that only minimum changes energy profiles experienced by permeating ions , equivalent to the energy of a single hydrogen or ionic bond , are required to abolish Mg2+ block . These findings indicate that only small structural changes are needed to convert a Mg(2+)-insensitive ion channel to a channel with pronounced voltage-dependent Mg2+ block .
