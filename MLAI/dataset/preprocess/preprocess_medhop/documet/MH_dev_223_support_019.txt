[ DB08836 treatment upregulated cardiomyocyte thioredoxin expression and improved autoimmune myocarditis ] . OBJECTIVE : P10599 ( TRX ) is a redox regulatory protein that protects cells from various stresses . P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitor was reported to enhance endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities . This study was carried out to investigate whether temocapril , a novel non-sulfhydryl containing P12821 inhibitor , reduces the severity of myocarditis via redox regulation mechanisms involving TRX . METHODS : The up-regulation of TRX by temocapril treatment was checked by Western blot in normal rat myocytes in vitro and in vivo , as well as in rats with experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) . RESULTS : DB08836 enhanced cytosolic redox regulatory protein TRX expression , but neither mitochondrial TRX2 nor antioxidant enzymes , such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ( Cu/Zn-SOD ) or manganese superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD ) expression , was up-regulated by the preconditioning treatment . In rats with EAM , the severity of myocarditis and the protein carbonyl contents were less increased in temocapril treatment ( 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) , orally ) from day 1 to day 21 , but not in temocapril treatment from day 15 to day 21 . If the characteristics of this model that myocardial inflammation begins around day 15 and keeps on until day 21 is considered , temocapril treatment for 3 weeks might be thought as a preconditioning treatment . CONCLUSIONS : TRX and the redox state modified by TRX may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of EAM . DB08836 ameliorates myocarditis with inducing TRX up-regulation in a preconditioning manner , although the mechanism of TRX up-regulation by temocapril remains to be elucidated .
