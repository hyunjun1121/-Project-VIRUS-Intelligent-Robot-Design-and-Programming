DB00945 resistance : clinical significance and genetic polymorphism . OBJECTIVE : To determine the prevalence , clinical implications and underlying mechanism of aspirin resistance in Chinese patients . METHODS : Platelet aggregation was determined by light transmission aggregometry ( P01374 ) using four different inducers . Patients were divided into aspirin-resistant ( AR ) , aspirin semi responder ( ASR ) and aspirin-sensitive ( AS ) groups , according to their P01374 results . DB00945 resistance was assessed by thrombo elastography ( TEG , with arachidonic acid [ AA ] or adenosine diphosphate as inducers ) , serum/urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 ( P28845 -TXB2 ) assay , platelet function analyser-100 assay and P16109 assay . Polymorphisms in the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 1 ( P23219 ) gene ( A842G , C50T , C22T , G128A , C644A and C714A ) , the P35354 gene ( G765C ) and the integrin Î²3 ( P05106 ) gene ( C196T ) were examined . RESULTS : The study included 360 aspirin-treated patients and 314 healthy controls . AS patients had significantly lower levels of P28845 -TXB2 than AR and ASR patients , and significantly lower levels of P16109 than AR patients . TEG-AA was more sensitive , specific and consistent than P16109 in detecting aspirin resistance . The frequency of the P35354 G765C mutation was significantly higher in the AR/ASR groups versus the AS group . CONCLUSIONS : TEG-AA was more sensitive , specific and consistent than the P16109 assay for detecting aspirin resistance , and the P35354 G765C mutation may be related to aspirin resistance .
