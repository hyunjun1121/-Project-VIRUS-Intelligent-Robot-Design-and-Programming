Involvement of sphingomyelin hydrolysis and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in the Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced stimulation of glucose metabolism in primary astrocytes . The effects of cannabinoids on metabolic pathways and signal transduction systems were studied in primary cultures of rat astrocytes . Delta9- DB00470 ( THC ) , the major active component of marijuana , increased the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 as well as the rate of glucose incorporation into phospholipids and glycogen . These effects of THC were mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 , and prevented by forskolin , pertussis toxin , and the P21554 receptor antagonist SR 141716 . THC did not affect basal DB02527 levels but partially antagonized the forskolin-induced elevation of intracellular DB02527 concentration . THC stimulated Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activity , P04049 phosphorylation , and P04049 translocation to the particulate cell fraction . In addition , the MAPK inhibitor PD 098095 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 were able to antagonize the THC-induced stimulation of glucose oxidation to CO2 , phospholipid synthesis and glycogen synthesis . The possible involvement of sphingomyelin breakdown in the metabolic effects of THC was studied subsequently . THC produced a rapid stimulation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis that was concomitant to an elevation of intracellular ceramide levels . This effect was prevented by SR 141716 . Moreover , the cell-permeable ceramide analog D-erythro-N-octanoylsphingosine , as well as exogenous sphingomyelinase , were able in turn to stimulate MAPK activity , to increase the amount of P04049 bound to the particulate cell fraction , and to stimulate glucose metabolism . The latter effect was prevented by PD 098059 and was not additive to that exerted by THC . Results thus indicate that THC produces a cannabinoid receptor-mediated stimulation of astrocyte metabolism that seems to rely on sphingomyelin hydrolysis and MAPK stimulation .
