Antimetastatic potential of P05121 -specific RNA aptamers . The serine protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is increased in several cancers , including breast , where it is associated with a poor outcome . Metastatic breast cancer has a dismal prognosis , as evidenced by treatment goals that are no longer curative but are largely palliative in nature . P05121 competes with integrins and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor on the surface of breast cancer cells for binding to vitronectin . This results in the detachment of tumor cells from the extracellular matrix , which is critical to the metastatic process . For this reason , we sought to isolate RNA aptamers that disrupt the interaction between P05121 and vitronectin . Through utilization of combinatorial chemistry techniques , aptamers have been selected that bind to P05121 with high affinity and specificity . We identified two aptamers , WT-15 and Q9GZT9 , that disrupt the interactions between P05121 and heparin , as well as P05121 and vitronectin , without affecting the antiprotease activity of P05121 . Furthermore , Q9GZT9 prevented the detachment of breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) from vitronectin in the presence of P05121 , resulting in an increase in cellular adhesion . Therefore , the P05121 aptamer Q9GZT9 demonstrates therapeutic potential as an antimetastatic agent and could possibly be used as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy for breast cancer .
