Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor , celecoxib , in patients with analgesic intolerance . Intolerance reactions to acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are common and caused by inhibition of P23219 enzyme . Therefore , drugs that selectively inhibit P35354 enzyme may be safe in these subjects . In this study , we evaluated the tolerability of celecoxib , a selective P35354 inhibitor , in patients with analgesic intolerance . The eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema , naso-ocular symptoms , bronchospasm , and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by ASA and/or NSAIDs . A single-blind , placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting . On 2 separate days , 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib ( DB00482 200 mg , Pfizer , Turkey ) were given with 2-hour intervals . Seventy-five subjects ( mean age : 38.2 +/- 1.4 years ; F:M : 55:20 ) were included in the study . Twenty-one subjects had asthma . No reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation . Although celecoxib seems to be a safe alternative drug in our study group , considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature , the drug should be recommended for patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist .
