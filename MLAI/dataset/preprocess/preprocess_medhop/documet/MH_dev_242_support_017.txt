Glutamate release in human cerebral cortex and its modulation by 5-hydroxytryptamine acting at h P28221 receptors . 1. The release of glutamic acid and its modulation by 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) in the human brain has been investigated in synaptosomal preparations from fresh neocortical samples obtained from patients undergoing neurosurgery to reach deeply sited tumours . 2 . The Ca2+-dependent K+ ( 15 mM ) -evoked overflow of glutamate was inhibited by 5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner ( EC50 = 2.9 nM ; maximal effect approximately 50 % ) . The inhibition caused by 5-HT was antagonized by the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin . The P28222 / P28221 receptor agonist sumatriptan mimicked 5-HT ( EC50 = 6.4 nM ; maximal effect approximately 50 % ) ; the effect of sumatriptan was also methiothepin-sensitive . Selective P08908 receptor antagonists could not prevent the inhibition of glutamate release by 5-HT . 3 . The P28222 / P28221 receptor ligand GR 127935 and the P28335 / P28222 / P28221 receptor ligand metergoline were unable to prevent the 5-HT effect ; instead they inhibited glutamate release , their effects being abolished by methiothepin . Some P08908 receptor antagonists also displayed intrinsic agonist activity . 4 . The effect of sumatriptan was prevented by ketanserin , a drug known to display much higher affinity for recombinant h P28221 than for h P28222 receptors . 5 . We propose that neocortical glutamatergic nerve terminals in human brain cortex possess release-inhibiting presynaptic heteroreceptors that appear to belong to the h P28221 subtype .
