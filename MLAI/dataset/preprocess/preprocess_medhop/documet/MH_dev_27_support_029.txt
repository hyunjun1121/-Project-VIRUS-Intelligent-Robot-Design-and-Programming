Examination of the role of magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis : A problem-orientated approach . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) has brought in several benefits to the study of Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . It provides accurate measurement of disease activity , facilitates precise diagnosis , and aid in the assessment of newer therapies . The imaging guidelines for MS are broadly divided in to approaches for imaging patients with suspected MS or clinically isolated syndromes ( Q9NSE2 ) or for monitoring patients with established MS . In this review , the technical aspects of MR imaging for MS are briefly discussed . The imaging process need to capture the twin aspects of acute MS viz. the autoimmune acute inflammatory process and the neurodegenerative process . Gadolinium enhanced Q9BWK5 can identify acute inflammatory lesions precisely . The commonly applied Q9BWK5 marker of disease progression is brain atrophy . Whole brain magnetization Transfer Ratio ( Q99707 ) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( P59665 ) are two other techniques use to monitor disease progression . A variety of imaging techniques such as Double Inversion Recovery ( P30518 ) , Spoiled Gradient Recalled ( SPGR ) acquisition , and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery ( FLAIR ) have been utilized to study the cortical changes in MS . Q9BWK5 is now extensively used in the Phase I , II and III clinical trials of new therapies . As the technical aspects of Q9BWK5 advance rapidly , and higher field strengths become available , it is hoped that the impact of Q9BWK5 on our understanding of MS will be even more profound in the next decade .
