Actions of DB00470 in cannabis : relation to use , abuse , dependence . Cannabis use disorders have been recently identified as a relevant clinical issue : a subset of cannabis smokers seeks treatment for their cannabis use , yet few succeed in maintaining long-term abstinence . The rewarding and positive reinforcing effects of the primary psychoactive component of smoked cannabis , DB00470 ( THC ) are mediated by the cannabinoid P21554 receptor . The P21554 receptor has also been shown to mediate cannabinoid dependence and expression of withdrawal upon cessation of drug administration , a phenomenon verified across species . This paper will review findings implicating the P21554 receptor in the behavioural effects of exogenous cannabinoids with a focus on cannabinoid dependence and reinforcement , factors that contribute to the maintenance of chronic cannabis smoking despite negative consequences . Opioidergic modulation of these effects is also discussed .
