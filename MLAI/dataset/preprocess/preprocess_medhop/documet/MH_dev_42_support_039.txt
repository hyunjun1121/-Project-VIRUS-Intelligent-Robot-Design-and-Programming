DB00398 in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors who failed two or more prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors : a phase II study of Korean gastrointestinal stromal tumors study group . PURPOSE : To evaluated the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) who failed to previous standard treatments . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Thirty-one patients with measurable metastatic GIST who failed both imatinib and sunitinib were accrued . DB00398 was administered orally at 400 mg twice daily until disease progression or development of intolerance . The primary endpoint was disease control rate ( response + stable disease , DCR ) at 24 weeks . RESULTS : DB00398 was well tolerated , with hand-foot skin reaction , fatigue , hypertension , and abdominal pain being the most frequent adverse events . The relative dose intensity of sorafenib during the first 6 months was > 80 % . Four patients achieved partial response ( response rate 13 % , 95 % CI 1-25 % ) , and 16 ( 52 % ) had stable disease . DCR at 24 weeks was measured as 36 % ( 95 % CI 19-52 % ) . Median progression-free and overall survivals were 4.9 and 9.7 months , respectively . Progression-free survival of patients with prior use of nilotinib ( P = .0085 ) and with primary genotypes other than P10721 exon 11 mutation ( P = .0341 ) was significantly shorter than that of patients without . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 showed antitumor activity in this population of imatinib and sunitinib pretreated GIST . With sorafenib , about one third of patients can maintain disease control for more than 24 weeks .
