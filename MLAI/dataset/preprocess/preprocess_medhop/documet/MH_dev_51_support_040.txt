TGF-β1-ROS- Q13315 -CREB signaling axis in macrophage mediated migration of human breast cancer MCF7 cells . Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment play an important role in tumor cell survival . They influence the tumor cell to proliferate , invade into surrounding normal tissues and metastasize to local and distant sites . In this study , we evaluated the effect of conditioned medium from monocytes and macrophages on growth and migration of breast cancer cells . Macrophage conditioned medium ( MϕCM ) containing elevated levels of cytokines P01375 -α , IL-1β and P05231 had a differential effect on non-invasive ( MCF7 ) and highly invasive ( MDA-MB-231 ) breast cancer cell lines . MϕCM induced the secretion of TGF-β1 in MCF7 cells . This was associated with apoptosis in a fraction of cells and generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( ROS and RNS ) and DNA damage in the remaining cells . This , in turn , increased expression of DB02527 response element binding protein ( CREB ) and vimentin resulting in migration of cells . These effects were inhibited by neutralization of P01375 -α , IL-1β and P05231 , inhibition of ROS and RNS , DNA damage and siRNA mediated knockdown of Q13315 . In contrast , MDA-MB-231 cells which had higher basal levels of pCREB were not affected by MϕCM . In summary , we have found that pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages induce TGF-β1 in tumor cells , which activate pCREB signaling , epithelial-mesenchymal-transition ( EMT ) responses and enhanced migration .
