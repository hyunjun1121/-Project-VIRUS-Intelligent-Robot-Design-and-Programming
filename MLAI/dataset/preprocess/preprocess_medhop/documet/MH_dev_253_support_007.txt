DB00533 produces intestinal but not gastric damage in the presence of a low dose of indomethacin in rats . Indomethacin in small doses is known to inhibit prostaglandin ( PG ) production , yet it does not damage the gastrointestinal mucosa . We examined whether a cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 inhibitor induces gastrointestinal damage in the presence of a low dose of indomethacin and investigated the ulcerogenic mechanism in relation to P35354 expression . Rats with or without 18-h fasting were administered rofecoxib ( a selective P35354 inhibitor ; 10 or 30 mg/kg p.o. ) in the absence or presence of indomethacin ( 3 mg/kg p.o. ) , and the gastric or intestinal mucosa was examined 8 and 24 h later , respectively . Neither indomethacin nor rofecoxib alone caused damage in the stomach or small intestine . However , indomethacin damaged the small intestine in the presence of rofecoxib , yet the same treatment did not damage the stomach . Indomethacin reduced the mucosal DB00917 content in both tissues , whereas rofecoxib did not . The P35354 mRNA was up-regulated in the intestine but not the stomach after indomethacin treatment , and the reduced DB00917 content was significantly recovered later only in the small intestine , in a rofecoxib-inhibitable manner . Indomethacin produced hypermotility in the small intestine but not the stomach , whereas rofecoxib had no effect . These results suggest that the PG deficiency caused by a low dose of indomethacin produces hypermotility and P35354 expression in the small intestine but not the stomach , resulting in damage when P35354 is inhibited . It is assumed that the hypermotility response is a key event in the expression of P35354 and thereby important in the development of mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract .
