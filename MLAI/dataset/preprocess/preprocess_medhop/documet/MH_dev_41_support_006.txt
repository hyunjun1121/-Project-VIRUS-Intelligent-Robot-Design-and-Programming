[ Endometrial cancer in young women -- clinical and molecular aspects ] . OBJECTIVES : The aim the study was to compare two groups of endometrial cancer patients ( below and above 45 years of age ) in the aspect of clinicopathological and molecular data . MATERIAL AND METHODS : The study encompassed 456 primary tumour samples retrospectively collected from a cohort of endometrial cancer patients , primarily treated by surgery Molecular analysis covered : copy number variations of 10 genes ( P11388 , P00533 , P04626 , P21860 , Q15303 , MYC , P24385 , P03372 , P42336 , O60216 ) analyzed by quantitative PCR ; mRNA expression of 6 genes ( Q13296 , RAD27 , Q01196 , O95863 , O43623 , O43490 ) analyzed with the use of reverse transcription quantitative PCR ; protein expression analysis of 8 markers ( P06401 , P03372 ; P00533 , P04626 , P21860 , Q15303 , P11388 , pAKT1 ) performed with the use of immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The younger group of patients was characterized by less frequent hypertension ( p < 0.00007 ) , less frequent myometrial infiltration ( p=0.002 ) and longer overall survival ( p=0.003 ) . Apart from O60216 gene aberrations , which were more frequent in younger patients ( p=0.02 ) , the study revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups . CONCLUSIONS : The study showed no molecular differences in the profile of younger and older endometrial cancer patients . Data on both the prognostic and predictive significance of O60216 in endometrial cancer are still insufficient . The clinical profile of younger patients with endometrial carcinoma was slightly better when compared to elderly patients . Younger patients were characterized by longer overall survival .
