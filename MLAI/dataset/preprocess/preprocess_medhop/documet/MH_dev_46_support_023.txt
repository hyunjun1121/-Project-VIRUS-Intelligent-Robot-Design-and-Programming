Pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence : target symptoms and target mechanisms . Alcoholism is a major public health problem and resembles , in many ways , other chronic relapsing medical conditions . At least 2 separate dimensions of its symptomatology offer targetable pathophysiological mechanisms . Systems that mediate positive reinforcement by alcohol are likely important targets in early stages of the disease , particularly in genetically susceptible individuals . In contrast , long term neuroadaptive changes caused by chronic alcohol use primarily appear to affect systems mediating negative affective states , and gain importance following a prolonged history of dependence . Feasibility of pharmacological treatment in alcoholism has been demonstrated by a first wave of drugs which consists of 3 currently approved medications , the aldehyde dehydrogenase blocker disulfiram , the opioid antagonist naltrexone ( NTX ) and the functional glutamate antagonist acamprosate ( ACM ) . The treatment toolkit is likely to be expanded in the near future . This will improve overall efficacy and allow individualized treatment , ultimately taking in account the patient 's genetic makeup . In a second wave , early human efficacy data are available for the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron , the GABA-B agonist baclofen and the anticonvulsant topiramate . The third wave is comprised of compounds predicted to be effective based on a battery of animal models . Using such models , a short list of additional targets has accumulated sufficient preclinical validation to merit clinical development . These include the cannabinoid P21554 receptor , receptors modulating glutamatergic transmission ( Q14416 , 3 and 5 ) , and receptors for stress-related neuropeptides corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF ) , neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and nociceptin . Once novel treatments are developed , the field faces a major challenge to assure their delivery to patients .
