Standard- and high-dose etoposide , ifosfamide , carboplatin , and epirubicin in 107 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer : a mature follow-up report . BACKGROUND : We conducted a phase I-II trial to assess the activity of standard-dose ( P18827 ) and high-dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) with etoposide , ifosfamide , cis/carboplatin , and epirubicin ( P01282 -E , VIC-E ) in 107 patients with limited-stage ( LS , stage I-IIIB ) and extensive stage ( ES , stage IV ) non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Updated results of a previously published trial are presented . RESULTS : Response rates and survival after P01282 -E were comparable to those of other standard-dose combination chemotherapies in NSCLC . Treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) in P18827 was 3 % in LS-NSCLC , and 8 % in ES-NSCLC . TRM was 4 % in patients selected for HDC by response rate and performance score . Five-year survival in LS-NSCLC was 12 % after P18827 , and 18 % after HDC ; it was 0 % for both treatment protocols in ES-NSCLC . CONCLUSIONS : The activity of P01282 -E P18827 and VIC-E HDC is not superior to that of established protocols in the treatment of NSCLC . In view of the toxicity and TRM associated with this protocol , less aggressive regimens should be preferred for most patients . Whether selected patients with chemosensitive disease could benefit from P01282 -E P18827 and/or VIC-E HDC in an adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting could not be determined within the scope of this study .
