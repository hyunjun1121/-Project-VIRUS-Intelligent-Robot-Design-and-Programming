T cell-mediated vascular dysfunction of human allografts results from P01579 dysregulation of NO synthase . Allograft vascular dysfunction predisposes to arteriosclerosis and graft loss . We examined how dysfunction develops in transplanted human arteries in response to circulating allogeneic T cells in vivo using immunodeficient murine hosts . Within 7-9 days , transplanted arteries developed endothelial cell ( EC ) dysfunction but remained sensitive to exogenous NO . By 2 weeks , the grafts developed impaired contractility and desensitization to NO , both signs of VSMC dysfunction . These T cell-dependent changes correlated with loss of P29474 and expression of P35228 -- the latter predominantly within infiltrating T cells . Neutralizing P01579 completely prevented both vascular dysfunction and changes in NOS expression ; neutralizing P01375 reduced P01579 production and partially prevented dysfunction . Inhibiting P35228 partially preserved responses to NO at 2 weeks and reduced graft intimal expansion after 4 weeks in vivo . In vitro , memory P01730 + T cells acted on allogeneic cultured ECs to reduce P29474 activity and expression of protein and mRNA . These effects required T cell activation by class II MHC antigens and costimulators ( principally lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 , or LFA-3 ) on the ECs and were mediated by production of soluble mediators including P01579 and P01375 . We conclude that P01579 is a central mediator of vascular dysfunction and , through dysregulation of NOS expression , links early dysfunction with late arteriosclerosis .
