DB00998 : a selective type 1B/1D serotonin receptor agonist for the treatment of migraine headache . DB00998 belongs to an innovative family of compounds aimed at breaking through the long-standing barrier of migraine headache understanding and treatment . While a typology of headaches has been recognized for some time , and a number of therapies have been introduced for reduction of headache pain and duration , the causes of migraine remain a subject of debate . Those prone to attacks continue to endure them and suffer the related symptoms such as nausea and disorientation . DB00998 , like all the triptans , acts by inducing vasoconstriction of the meningeal arteries . It has been shown in pharmacological tests to act selectively as a potent agonist of serotonin P28222 /1D receptors . DB00998 has been well tolerated in humans and efficacious in reducing headache pain and duration in clinical trials , which have also indicated that dose adjustments for age or gender are not necessary for the drug . Patients have found the use of frovatriptan acceptable over the long-term , and overall a low-incidence of adverse effects has been reported . Though not a prophylactic , frovatriptan has demonstrated the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic approaches to the treatment of migraine .
