The effects of rimonabant on brown adipose tissue in rat : implications for energy expenditure . The cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist rimonabant ( SR 141716 ) produces a sustained decrease in body weight on a background of a transient reduction in food intake . An increase in energy expenditure has been implicated , possibly mediated via peripheral endocannabinoid system ; however , the role of the central endocannabinoid system is unclear . The present study investigates this role . DB06155 ( 10 mg/kg IP ) was administered for 21 days to rats surgically implanted with biotelemetry devices to measure temperature in the interscapular brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) . Q14032 temperature as a putative measure of thermogenesis in the Q14032 , physical activity , body weight , food intake , as well as changes in P25874 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein were measured . In addition , role of the CNS in mediating these actions of rimonabant was determined in rats where the Q14032 was sympathetically denervated . As expected , chronic administration of rimonabant significantly reduced body weight for the entire treatment period despite only a transient decrease in food intake . There was a profound increase in Q14032 temperature , particularly during the dark phase of each circadian cycle throughout the treatment period . A corresponding increase in uncoupling protein ( P25874 ) was also observed following chronic rimonabant treatment . The rimonabant-induced elevation in Q14032 temperature and decrease in body weight were significantly attenuated following denervation , indicating an involvement of the CNS . These findings suggest that the long-term weight loss associated with rimonabant treatment is due at least in part to an elevation in energy expenditure , represented here by elevated temperature recorded in the Q14032 , which is mediated primarily by the central endocannabinoid system .
