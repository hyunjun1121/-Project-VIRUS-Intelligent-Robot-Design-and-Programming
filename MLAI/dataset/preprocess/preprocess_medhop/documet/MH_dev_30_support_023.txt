[ Innate resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibition after 5-fluorouracil treatment -- a rationale of combined use of cisplatin and its optimal administration dose ] . We examined the changes of the number of DB00322 MP binding sites of thymidylate thynthase ( TS-BS ) in Yoshida sarcoma after administration of DB00544 to the tumor bearing rats . We also investigated the optimal dose of DB00515 for the increase of intracellular folate level . In the group received consecutive 7-days administration of DB09327 ( U-7 group ) , total TS-BS was significantly increased compared with non-treatment group and the group received only DB09327 ( U-1 group ) . For free TS-BS , however , there was no difference despite of DB09327 administration . P04818 inhibition rate ( TSIR ) was , therefore , significantly high in U-7 group compared with U-1 group . It seemed necessary to take some counter measure for the induction of TS in the tumor tissue when DB00544 chemotherapy was performed . The optimal dose of DB00515 as a modulator of DB00544 was 1 mg/kg in rat when it was estimated from the changes of intracellular folate levels after administration , which was less than the dose to reveal its own anticancer effect .
