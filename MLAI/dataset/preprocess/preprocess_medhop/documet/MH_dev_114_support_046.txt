Fibroblast growth factors mobilize peritoneal macrophage intracellular calcium . Macrophages have been implicated in the propagation of inflammatory disease . The evidence linking macrophages to inflammation stems from their elicited responses to various extracellular ligands eventually culminating in the elaboration of a variety of inflammatory mediators . As part of an investigation of fibroblast growth factors role in promoting inflammation , we examined one aspect of transmembrane signal transduction , intracellular calcium mobilization following culture of murine peritoneal macrophages with acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor . Peritoneal macrophages displayed a rapid rise in cytosolic calcium from a basal level of 147.6 +/- 25.4 nM to 261.9 +/- 49.9 nM at 3.5 minutes following culture with acidic fibroblast growth . A similar rise in calcium was noted with basic fibroblast growth factor . Titration revealed the maximal effective dose of P05230 and P09038 with respect to calcium response to be 10 ng/ml . Using blockers of both voltage and non-voltage gated channels , the FGF induced rise in cytosolic calcium was specifically abolished . Similarly , using specific P09917 ( A69412 ) or cyclooxygenase ( Indomethacin ) blockers , the P05230 induced rise in maximal calcium response was reduced by 41 % and 96 % respectively . On the basis of these data , we speculate on some possible roles that FGF may play in the inflammatory response .
