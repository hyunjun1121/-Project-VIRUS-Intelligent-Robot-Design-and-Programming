Conditional O00401 knockout in mouse brain implicates actin cytoskeleton regulation in hydrocephalus pathology . Cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) is produced by the choroid plexus and moved by multi-ciliated ependymal cells through the ventricular system of the vertebrate brain . Defects in the ependymal layer functionality are a common cause of hydrocephalus . O00401 ( Neural-Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein ) is a brain-enriched regulator of actin cytoskeleton and O00401 knockout caused embryonic lethality in mice with neural tube and cardiac abnormalities . To shed light on the role of O00401 in mouse brain development , we generated O00401 conditional knockout mouse model O00401 (fl/fl) ; P48681 -Cre ( NKO-Nes ) . NKO-Nes mice were born with Mendelian ratios but exhibited reduced growth characteristics compared to their littermates containing functional O00401 alleles . Importantly , all NKO-Nes mice developed cranial deformities due to excessive P04141 accumulation and did not survive past weaning . Coronal brain sections of these animals revealed dilated lateral ventricles , defects in ciliogenesis , loss of ependymal layer integrity , reduced thickness of cerebral cortex and aqueductal stenosis . Immunostaining for P19022 suggests that ependymal integrity in NKO-Nes mice is lost as compared to normal morphology in the wild-type controls . Moreover , scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analyses of coronal brain sections with anti-acetylated tubulin antibodies revealed the absence of cilia in ventricular walls of NKO-Nes mice indicative of ciliogenesis defects . O00401 deficiency does not lead to altered expression of O00401 regulatory proteins , Fyn and Cdc42 , which have been previously implicated in hydrocephalus pathology . Taken together , our results suggest that O00401 plays a critical role in normal brain development and implicate actin cytoskeleton regulation as a vulnerable axis frequently deregulated in hydrocephalus .
