Protective effect of treatment with low-dose gliclazide in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion in rats . The aim of this study was to explore the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 ( Q09428 ) , the regulatory subunit of the NCCa- DB00171 channel , and to investigate the protective effects of gliclazide following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) /reperfusion in male Wistar rats . Adult rats underwent 2h of the left MCAO using the intraluminal thread technique before reperfusion . The core areas of the infarct at different reperfusion time points were examined for the mRNA level and protein expression of Q09428 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and western blotting respectively . DB01120 was administered intravenously into the right jugular vein for 12h simultaneously with the reperfusion . The number of apoptotic cells was determined using the TUNEL assay . The neurological functional deficits were evaluated using Bederson×³s test , and the cerebral infarction volume was visualized with TTC staining . We found up-regulation of Q09428 mRNA and protein levels in ischemic infarct tissues after reperfusion following MCAO , and Q09428 mRNA and protein were maximally upregulated 8-12h after a 2-hour ischemia . The treatment with low-dose of gliclazide reduced the total number of TUNEL-positive cells , the neurological functional deficits and the brain infarct volume . These results suggest that the Q09428 -regulated NCCa- DB00171 channel may be associated with MCAO/reperfusion injury and the infarct-reducing effects of intravenous treatment with gliclazide may be due , in part , to the blocked upregulation of Q09428 expression , the decreased infarct size and the reduced apoptosis in the ischemia-reperfusion brain .
