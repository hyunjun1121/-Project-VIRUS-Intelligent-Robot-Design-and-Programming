Identification of a potent inverse agonist at a constitutively active mutant of human Q9H244 receptor . Human platelets express two P2Y receptors : G(q)-coupled P2Y(1) , and G(i)-coupled P2Y(12) . Both P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) are ADP receptors on human platelets and are essential for ADP-induced platelet aggregation that plays pivotal roles in thrombosis and hemostasis . Numerous constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors have been described in natural or recombinant systems , but in the P2Y receptors , to date , no constitutive activity has been reported . In our effort to identify G protein coupling domains of the human platelet ADP receptor , we constructed a chimeric hemagglutinin-tagged human P2Y(12) receptor with its C terminus replaced by the corresponding part of human P2Y(1) receptor and stably expressed it in Chinese hamster ovary- P04264 cells . It is interesting that the chimeric P2Y(12) mutant exhibited a high level of constitutive activity , as evidenced by decreased DB02527 levels in the absence of agonists . The constitutive activation of the chimeric P2Y(12) mutant was dramatically inhibited by pertussis toxin , a G(i) inhibitor . The constitutively active P2Y(12) mutant retained normal responses to 2-methylthio-ADP , with an EC(50) of 0.15 +/- 0.04 nM . The constitutively active P2Y(12) mutant caused Akt phosphorylation that was abolished by the addition of pertussis toxin . Pharmacological evaluation of several P2Y(12) antagonists revealed ( E ) -N-[1-[7-(hexylamino)-5-(propylthio)-3H-1,2,3-triazolo-[4,5-d]-pyrimidin-3-yl]-1,5,6-trideoxy-beta-d-ribo-hept-5-enofuranuronoyl]-l-aspartic acid ( AR-C78511 ) as a potent P2Y(12) inverse agonist and 5'-adenylic acid , N-[2-(methylthio)ethyl]-2-[(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)thio]- , monoanhydride with (dichloromethylene)bis [ phosphonic acid ] ( AR-C69931MX ) as a neutral antagonist . In conclusion , this is the first report of a cell line stably expressing a constitutively active mutant of human platelet P2Y(12) receptor and the identification of potent inverse agonist .
