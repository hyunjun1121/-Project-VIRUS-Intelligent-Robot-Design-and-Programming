Plasma levels of DB02527 , cGMP and P80511 in sildenafil-induced headache . DB00203 , a selective inhibitor of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) degrading phosphodiestrase 5 ( O76074 ) , induced migraine without aura in 10 of 12 migraine patients and in healthy subjects it induced significantly more headache than placebo . The aim of the present study was to determine whether the pain-inducing effects of sildenafil would be reflected in plasma levels of important signalling molecules in migraine : cGMP , cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( DB02527 ) and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) . Ten healthy subjects ( four women , six men ) and 12 patients ( 12 women ) suffering from migraine without aura were included in two separate double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over studies in which placebo or sildenafil 100 mg was administered orally . Plasma levels of P80511 , DB02527 and cGMP were determined in blood from the antecubital vein . Despite the ability of sildenafil to induce headache and migraine , no significant differences in plasma levels of P80511 , cGMP and DB02527 were detected after sildenafil compared with placebo . In conclusion , plasma levels of P80511 , cGMP and DB02527 remain normal during sildenafil-induced headache or migraine . However , since previous studies indicate an important role of these signalling molecules , the present study questions whether DB02527 and cGMP in peripheral blood can be used for monitoring pathophysiological events in headache and migraine mechanisms .
