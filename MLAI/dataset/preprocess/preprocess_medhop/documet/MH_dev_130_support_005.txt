Chronic P01375 -α neutralization does not improve insulin resistance or endothelial function in " healthy " men with metabolic syndrome . The possible contribution of tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance in humans is still controversial . Our study investigated the effect of P01375 -α neutralization on insulin resistance in healthy , obese and insulin resistant men . We performed a prospective , randomized , double-blind placebo-controlled trial in nine young , healthy obese male subjects with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance . Volunteers received three infusions ( wks 0 , 2 and 6 ) of infliximab or placebo . P01308 resistance was measured at baseline and after 70 d by homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA ) index as well as by minimal model analysis of an intravenous glucose tolerance test . Endothelial function was accessed before and after intervention by flow mediated dilation . DB00065 improved the inflammatory status as indicated by reduced high sensitivity P02741 ( hsCRP ) and fibrinogen levels ( 2.77 ± 0.6 to 1.8 ± 0.5 μg/L , and 3.42 ± 0.18 to 3.18 ± 0.28 g/L ; ( day 0 and day 70 , P = 0.020 and 0.037 respectively ) , but did not improve insulin resistance ( HOMA index and intravenous glucose-tolerance test [ ivGGT ] ) or endothelial function . Despite improvements in inflammatory status , chronic P01375 -α neutralization does not improve insulin resistance or endothelial function in seemingly healthy , but obese , insulin-resistant volunteers . This study severely questions the proposal that P01375 -α is a causative link between adiposity and insulin resistance .
