AL3810 , a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor , exhibits potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumour activity via targeting VEGFR , FGFR and P09619 . Angiogenesis plays an important role in neoplastic transformation and progression as well as in the metastasis process of most human cancers . Herein , we identified AL3810 as a novel and orally bioavailable small molecular inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against multiple tyrosine kinases involved in the process of angiogenesis . We found that AL3810 substantially inhibited the autophosphorylation of P35968 , PDGFRÎ² and P11362 in endothelial cells . Moreover , AL3810 exhibited potent anti-angiogenesis activity , manifested by significant inhibition of microvessel outgrowth of rat arterial ring and chickallantochorion membrane ( P62158 ) in ex vivo angiogenesis models . Daily dosing of AL3810 has shown broad-spectrum anti-tumour activity in human kidney , pancreas , liver cancer xenograft models . Importantly , immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the anti-tumour activity of AL3810 was closely correlated with its anti-angiogenesis activity , as demonstrated by a decreased microvessel area and reduced microvessel numbers in tumour tissues . The overall pharmacological profiles of AL3810 are superior to sorafenib . The clinical trials of AL3810 will soon be launched in China .
