P11274 / P00519 and other kinases from chronic myeloproliferative disorders stimulate single-strand annealing , an unfaithful DNA double-strand break repair . Myeloproliferative disorders ( P53602 ) are stem cell-derived clonal diseases arising as a consequence of acquired aberrations in c- P00519 , Janus-activated kinase 2 ( O60674 ) , and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) that generate oncogenic fusion tyrosine kinases ( FTK ) , including P11274 / P00519 , P41212 / P00519 , P41212 / O60674 , and P41212 /PDGFbetaR . Here , we show that FTKs stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) both in hematopoietic cell lines and in P28906 (+) leukemic stem/progenitor cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . Single-strand annealing ( SSA ) represents a relatively rare but very unfaithful DSB repair mechanism causing chromosomal aberrations . Using a specific reporter cassette integrated into genomic DNA , we found that P11274 / P00519 and other FTKs stimulated SSA activity . Imatinib-mediated inhibition of P11274 / P00519 abrogated this effect , implicating a kinase-dependent mechanism . Y253F , E255K , T315I , and H396P mutants of P11274 / P00519 that confer imatinib resistance also stimulated SSA . Increased expression of either nonmutated or mutated P11274 / P00519 kinase , as is typical of blast phase cells and very primitive chronic phase CML cells , was associated with higher SSA activity . P11274 / P00519 -mediated stimulation of SSA was accompanied by enhanced nuclear colocalization of P43351 and P07992 , which play a key role in the repair . Taken together , these findings suggest a role of FTKs in causing disease progression in MPDs by inducing chromosomal instability through the production of DSBs and stimulation of SSA repair .
