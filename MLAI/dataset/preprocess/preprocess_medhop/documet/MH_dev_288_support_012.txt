Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis of P42898 , P05121 , P12821 , P27169 , and P29474 gene polymorphisms in patients with early onset coronary artery disease . BACKGROUND : Association studies in the Turkish population have investigated the single locus effects of different gene polymorphisms on coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . CAD is a complex polygenic disease that involves complex interactions among multiple genetic and environmental conditions . DESIGN : We evaluated associations of five candidate genetic polymorphisms ( methylene DB00116 reductase C677T , plasminogen activator inhibitor 4G/5G , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) 3-27 base pair repeat , insertion , or deletion of a 287 bp Alu repeat sequence polymorhism of angiotensin I converting enzyme , and paraoxonase Gln192Arg P27169 polymorphisms ) with the presence and extent of early onset CAD . METHODS : DNA was isolated and amplified from 90 consecutive patients with angiographically proven early onset CAD ( ages 41 ± 5 for men , 49 ± 7 for women ) and also from 90 control subjects with no significant coronary obstruction angiographically ( ages 42 ± 5 for men , 48 ± 6 for women ) . Multifactor dimensionality reduction ( MDR ) analysis was performed to identify a model of CAD based on both genetic and conventional risk factors . RESULTS : MDR analysis detected a significant model with four genes ( prediction success ∼ 61 % , p = 0.03 ) . When the total number of the conventional risk factors is analysed with the candidate polymorphisms , a different model is identified that includes three of the four genes from the above model and achieves a similar prediction of CAD as the gene only model . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that gene-gene and gene-environmental risk interactions form significant models in predicting early onset CAD .
