Comparison of gene expression profiles and related pathways in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) is one of the main causes of severe pulmonary hypertension . However , despite treatment ( pulmonary endarterectomy ) , in approximately 15-20 % of patients , pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure continue to increase . To date , little is known about the changes that occur in gene expression in CTEPH . The identification of genes associated with CTEPH may provide insight into the pathogenesis of CTEPH and may aid in diagnosis and treatment . In this study , we analyzed the gene expresion profiles of pulmonary artery endothelial cells from 5 patients with CTEPH and 5 healthy controls using oligonucleotide microarrays . Bioinformatics analyses using the Gene Ontology ( GO ) and KEGG databases were carried out to identify the genes and pathways specifically associated with CTEPH . Signal transduction networks were established to identify the core genes regulating the progression of CTEPH . A number of genes were found to be differentially expressed in the pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with CTEPH . In total , 412 GO terms and 113 pathways were found to be associated with our list of genes . All differential gene interactions in the Signal-Net network were analyzed . P52333 , P30679 , O15264 , P32121 and P25116 were the most significantly altered . Bioinformatics analysis may help gather and analyze large amounts of data in microarrays by means of rigorous experimental planning , scientific statistical analysis and the collection of complete data . In this study , a novel differential gene expression pattern was constructed . However , further studies are required to identify novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of CTEPH .
