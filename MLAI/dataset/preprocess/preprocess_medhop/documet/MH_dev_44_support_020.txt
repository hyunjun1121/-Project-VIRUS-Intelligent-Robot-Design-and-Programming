Twisting immune responses for allogeneic stem cell therapy . Stem cell-derived tissues and organs have the potential to change modern clinical science . However , rejection of allogeneic grafts by the host 's immune system is an issue which needs to be addressed before embryonic stem cell-derived cells or tissues can be used as medicines . Mismatches in human leukocyte class I antigens and minor histocompatibility antigens are the central factors that are responsible for various graft-versus-host diseases . Traditional strategies usually involve suppressing the whole immune systems with drugs . There are many side effects associated with these methods . Here , we discuss an emerging strategy for manipulating the central immune tolerance by naturally " introducing " donor antigens to a host so a recipient can acquire tolerance specifically to the donor cells or tissues . This strategy has two distinct stages . The first stage restores the thymic function of adult patients with sex steroid inhibitory drugs ( P01148 -A ) , keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) , interleukin 7 ( P13232 ) and P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) . The second stage introduces hematopoietic stem cells and their downstream progenitors to the restored thymus by direct injection . Hematopoietic stem cells are used to introduce donor antigens because they have priority access to the thymus . We also review several clinical cases to explain this new strategy .
