Q06187 is a therapeutic target in stem-like cells from multiple myeloma . DB09053 ( Imbruvica ) , a small-drug inhibitor of Q06187 ( Q06187 ) , is currently undergoing clinical testing in patients with multiple myeloma , yet important questions on the role of Q06187 in myeloma biology and treatment are outstanding . Using flow-sorted side population cells from human myeloma cell lines and multiple myeloma primary samples as surrogate for the elusive multiple myeloma stem cell , we found that elevated expression of Q06187 in myeloma cells leads to AKT/WNT/Î²-catenin-dependent upregulation of key stemness genes ( Q01860 , P48431 , Q9H9S0 , and MYC ) and enhanced self-renewal . Enforced transgenic expression of Q06187 in myeloma cells increased features of cancer stemness , including clonogenicity and resistance to widely used myeloma drugs , whereas inducible knockdown of Q06187 abolished them . Furthermore , overexpression of Q06187 in myeloma cells promoted tumor growth in laboratory mice and rendered side population-derived tumors that contained high levels of Q06187 more sensitive to the selective , second-generation Q06187 inhibitor , CGI1746 , than side population-derived tumors that harbored low levels of Q06187 . Taken together , these findings implicate Q06187 as a positive regulator of myeloma stemness and provide additional support for the clinical testing of Q06187 -targeted therapies in patients with myeloma .
