Stimulation of epithelial repair is a likely mechanism for the action of mifepristone in reducing duration of bleeding in users of progestogen-only contraceptives . Many women using progestogen ( P ) -only contraceptives experience uterine bleeding problems . In clinical trials , a single low dose of mifepristone , given to DB00294 users at the beginning of a bleeding episode reduced the number of bleeding days by approximately 50 % compared with controls . In this study , a single dose of mifepristone was administered to etonogestrel ( P17813 ) -exposed pseudo-pregnant mice , 5 days after artificial decidualization was induced when the endometrium showed signs of bleeding . Control mice received vehicle alone . Mice were culled 12- , 18- , 24- and 48-h post-treatment . In the continued presence of P17813 , a single dose of mifepristone stimulated tissue breakdown followed by very rapid repair : most treated tissues were fully restored to the pre-decidualized state by 48 h post-treatment . During repair , proliferating cells ( Ki67 immunostained ) were localized to a band of cells around the basal area in breaking down tissues and to the repairing luminal epithelium and glands . P06401 -positive cells were largely localized to the basal area of the breaking down tissue in treated mice compared with decidual cells in controls . Oestrogen receptor-positive cells were observed in the repairing luminal epithelium and glands compared with the decidua and the basal region in control tissues . It is concluded that mifepristone treatment stimulates rapid restoration of luminal epithelial integrity : such action may be a key event in reducing the number of bleeding days observed in women using DB00294 who were treated with a single dose of mifepristone .
