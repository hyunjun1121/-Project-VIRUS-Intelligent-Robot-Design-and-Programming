Biological and immunological studies of bovine hypothalamic DB05394 . P06850 B ( CRF-B ) is a peptide(s) isolated from bovine hypothalamic extracts by Sephadex G-100 chromatography on the basis of its ability to stimulate secretion of adrenocorticotropin ( DB01285 ) in vitro and in vivo . It is similar in molecular size to the 41-residue ovine CRF ( oCRF ) or rat CRF ( rCRF ) recently elucidated and appears to be their bovine counterpart . Immunoreactivity of CRF-B was examined in homologous radioimmunoassays ( RIAs ) for oCRF or rCRF , using several anti-oCRF and anti-rCRF antibodies . CRF-B cross-reacted well with anti-oCRF antibodies but poorly with anti-rCRF antibodies . Purification of CRF-B with preparative isoelectric focusing yielded four CRF peaks , B-1 ( pH 4.7 ) , B-2 ( pH 5.5 ) , B-3 ( pH 6.3 ) , and B-4 ( pH 7.0 ) , which accounted for 16 , 30 , 46 , and 8 % of the total immunoreactivity , respectively . CRF B-2 , B-3 , and B-4 showed both immunological activity and biological activity in vitro ( cell culture assay ) and in vivo ( Arimura assay ) , whereas CRF B-1 showed only immunoreactivity . Their relative bioactivity/immunoreactivity ratios were 0 ( B-1 ) , 1 ( B-2 ) , 1 ( B-3 ) , and 3 ( B-4 ) . All of these CRF-B subtypes exhibited RIA displacement curves parallel to that for the oCRF standard and coeluted with oCRF on Sephadex G-100 chromatography , which suggests that their molecular modifications are relatively minor .
