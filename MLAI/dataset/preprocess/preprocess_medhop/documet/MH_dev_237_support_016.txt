Putative role of HIF transcriptional activity in melanocytes and melanoma biology . Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) is a highly oxygen sensitive bHLH protein that is part of the heterodimeric Q9BYW2 transcription factor . Under hypoxic stress , Q9BYW2 activity is induced to control expression of multiple downstream target genes , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . The normal epidermis exists in a constant mild hypoxic microenvironment and constitutively expresses HIF-1α and HIF-2α . Expression of HIF-1α and/or HIF-2α has been suggested to correlate with the increased malignant potential of melanocytes , therefore , failures of melanoma therapies may be partially linked to high HIF activity . Notably , melanomas that have the V600E P15056 mutation exhibit increased HIF-1α expression . We have utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify putative hypoxia response elements ( HREs ) in a set of genes known to participate in the process of melanogenesis ( includingTRPM1 , Q9UMX9 , P01112 , C- P10721 , P40967 and P06850 ) . While some of the mechanistic links between these genes and the HIF pathway have been previously explored , others await further investigation . Although agents targeting HIF activity have been proposed as novel treatment modalities for melanoma , there are currently no clinical trials in progress to test their efficacy in melanoma .
