DB01628 -induced fixed drug eruption with positive lesional patch tests . Fixed drug eruption ( FDE ) is most commonly associated with antibiotics , anticonvulsants , and nonnarcotic analgens , including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) . However , the newer cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors have been rarely reported to cause FDE . We report the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian woman with erythematous pruritic plaques on the neck , left forearm , and second finger of the right hand , healing with hyperpigmentation and recurring in the same locations . The patient was sporadically taking oral etoricoxib 90 mg for her back pain and noticed the relation between administration of the drug and skin lesions , the time interval decreasing progressively from 1 week to 30 minutes . No other signs , symptoms , or drug intake was mentioned . The patch tests with etoricoxib 1 % and 5 % in petrolatum were positive at the location of the lesions and negative on the back ( nonlesional skin ) . Standard European and NSAID series were negative . Patch tests of 10 healthy controls with etoricoxib 1 % and 5 % in petrolatum were negative . After the avoidance of the drug , no relapse was mentioned . The patch test was reliable for the diagnosis of FDE , avoiding the need for subsequent oral provocation testing and therefore preventing the possible adverse effects . Despite being regarded as a safe drug , the occurrence of cutaneous adverse reactions to etoricoxib should be considered , especially in the setting of its increasing use in pain control .
