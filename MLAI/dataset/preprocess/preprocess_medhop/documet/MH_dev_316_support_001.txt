Novel synthesis of various orthogonally protected Cα-methyllysine analogues and biological evaluation of a vapreotide analogue containing ( S ) -α-methyllysine . Prochiral malonic diesters containing a quaternary carbon center have been successfully transformed into a diverse set of (t)Boc-Fmoc-α(2,2)-methyllysine-OH analogues through chiral malonic half-ester intermediates obtained via enzymatic ( Pig Liver Esterase , PLE ) hydrolysis . The variety of chiral half-ester intermediates , which vary from 1 to 6 methylene units in the side chain , are achieved in moderate to high optical purity and in good yields . The PLE hydrolysis of malonic diesters with various side chain lengths appears to obey the Jones 's PLE model according to the stereochemical configurations of the resulting chiral half-esters . The established synthetic strategy allows the construction of both enantiomers of α(2,2)-methyllysine analogues , and a ( S ) -β(2,2)-methyllysine analogue from a common synthon by straightforward manipulation of protecting groups . Two different straightforward and cost effective synthetic strategies are described for the synthesis of α(2,2)-methyllysine analogues . The described strategies should find significant usefulness in preparing novel peptide libraries with unnatural lysine analogues . A DB04894 analogue incorporating ( S ) -α(2,2)-methyllysine was prepared . However , the DB04894 analogue with ( S ) -α-methyl-α-lysine is found to lose its specific binding to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( P30874 ) .
