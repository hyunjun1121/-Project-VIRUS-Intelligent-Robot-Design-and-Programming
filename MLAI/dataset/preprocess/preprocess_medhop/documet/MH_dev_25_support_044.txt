Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor up-regulates P32246 in human neutrophils . Neutrophils ( polymorphonuclear leukocytes ; PMN ) are phagocytic cells instrumental in the clearance of infectious pathogens . Human PMN are commonly thought to respond primarily to chemokines from the CXC family . However , recent findings suggest that under specific cytokine activation conditions , PMN can also respond to some CC chemokines . In this study , the effect of GM- P04141 , a well-characterized PMN priming and maturation factor , on CC-chemokine receptor ( CCR ) expression in PMN was investigated . Constitutive expression of P32246 and P51677 mRNA in PMN was detected by ribonuclease protection assay . Following incubation of PMN with GM- P04141 ( 0.01-10 ng/ml ; 6 h ) P32246 mRNA expression was rapidly ( approximately 1 h ) up-regulated . In contrast , no significant induction of P41597 , P51677 , CCR4 , or P51681 mRNA was observed . P32246 protein was also up-regulated by GM- P04141 stimulation . GM- P04141 -induced up-regulation of P32246 showed functional consequences because GM- P04141 -treated PMN , but not control cells , responded to the CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha , monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 , and RANTES in assays of chemotactic migration and intracellular calcium mobilization . These results suggest that PMN activated by the proinflammatory cytokine GM- P04141 can change their receptor expression pattern and become responsive to CC chemokines .
