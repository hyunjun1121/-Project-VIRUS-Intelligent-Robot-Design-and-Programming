Red blood cell surface adhesion molecules : their possible roles in normal human physiology and disease . Human erythrocytes express a relatively large number of known adhesion receptors , despite the fact that red blood cells ( RBCs ) are generally considered to be nonadhesive for endothelial cell surfaces . Some of these adhesion receptors are expressed by many other tissues , while others have more limited tissue distribution . Some adhesion receptors , including P16671 and VLA-4 , are only expressed by immature erythroid cells , while others are present on mature erythrocytes . The structure and function of these proteins is reviewed here . LW , P16671 , P19256 , and CD147 have been shown in other tissues to mediate cell-cell interaction . Other receptors , such as P16070 , VLA-4 , and B- P62158 /LU , can mediate adhesion to components of extracellular matrix . In addition , their roles in normal erythropolesis , as well as in the pathophysiology of human disease , are summarized . The most convincing evidence for a pathophysiologic role for any of these receptors on erythrocytes comes from studies of cells from patients homozygous for hemoglobin S , as RBC adhesion is thought to contribute to vaso-occlusion . Thus , receptors such as B- P62158 /LU may become targets for future therapy aimed at preventing or ameliorating this thrombotic process .
