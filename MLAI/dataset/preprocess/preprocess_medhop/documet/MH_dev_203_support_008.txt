Intracellular targets of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors : identification by affinity chromatography using immobilised inhibitors . BACKGROUND : Chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) have great therapeutic potential against various proliferative and neurodegenerative disorders . DB02116 , a 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine , has been optimized for activity against P06493 /cyclin B by combinatorial and medicinal chemistry efforts to yield the purvalanol inhibitors . Although many studies support the action of purvalanols against CDKs , the actual intracellular targets of 2,6 , 9-trisubstituted purines remain unverified . RESULTS : To address this issue , purvalanol B ( 95. ) and an N6-methylated , CDK-inactive derivative ( 95M. ) were immobilized on an agarose matrix . Extracts from a diverse collection of cell types and organisms were screened for proteins binding purvalanol B . In addition to validating CDKs as intracellular targets , a variety of unexpected protein kinases were recovered from the 95. matrix . Casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ) was identified as a principal 95. matrix binding protein in Plasmodium falciparum , Leishmania mexicana , Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi . DB02733 compounds also inhibit the proliferation of these parasites , suggesting that CK1 is a valuable target for further screening with 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine libraries . CONCLUSIONS : That a simple batchwise affinity chromatography approach using two purine derivatives facilitated isolation of a small set of highly purified kinases suggests that this could be a general method for identifying intracellular targets relevant to a particular class of ligands . This method allows a close correlation to be established between the pattern of proteins bound to a small family of related compounds and the pattern of cellular responses to these compounds .
