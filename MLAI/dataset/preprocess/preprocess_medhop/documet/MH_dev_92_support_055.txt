Genes involved in carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake are up-regulated in the liver of sows during lactation . BACKGROUND : Convincing evidence exist that carnitine synthesis and uptake of carnitine into cells is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ( Q07869 ) , a transcription factor which is physiologically activated during fasting or energy deprivation . Sows are typically in a negative energy balance during peak lactation . We investigated the hypothesis that genes involved in carnitine synthesis and uptake in the liver of sows are up-regulated during peak lactation . FINDINGS : Transcript levels of several PPARα target genes involved in fatty acid uptake ( P15090 , O43772 ) , fatty acid oxidation ( Q15067 , CYP4A24 ) and ketogenesis ( P54868 , Q9NSA1 ) were elevated in the liver of lactating compared to non-lactating sows ( P < 0.05 ) . In addition , transcript levels of genes involved in carnitine synthesis ( P49189 , Q9NVH6 , O75936 ) and carnitine uptake ( O76082 ) in the liver were greater in lactating than in non-lactating sows ( P < 0.05 ) . DB00583 concentrations in liver and plasma were about 20 % and 50 % , respectively , lower in lactating than in non-lactating sows ( P < 0.05 ) , which is likely due to an increased loss of carnitine via the milk . CONCLUSIONS : The results of the present study show that PPARα is activated in the liver of sows during lactation which leads to an up-regulation of genes involved in carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake . The PPARα mediated up-regulation of genes involved in carnitine synthesis and uptake in the liver of lactating sows may be regarded as an adaptive mechanism to maintain hepatic carnitine levels at a level sufficient to transport excessive amounts of fatty acids into the mitochondrion .
