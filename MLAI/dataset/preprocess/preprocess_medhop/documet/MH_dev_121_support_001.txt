Down-regulation of P12830 in mouse skin carcinoma cells enhances a migratory and invasive phenotype linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 gelatinase expression . To assess the role of gelatinases in mouse skin tumor progression and their link to the expression of P12830 ( E-CD ) , the cell-cell adhesion protein , we used the highly metastatic squamous HaCa4 cell line and several HaCa4-derived clones obtained by transfection of the mouse E-CD cDNA . Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) mRNA and protein activity were present in E-CD ( - ) HaCa4 and control clones in culture , but they were strongly diminished in E-CD ( + ) clones ( E24 and E62 ) at subconfluence . To explore the suppressive effect of the cell-cell contacts mediated by E-CD on P14780 expression , we introduced a plasmid encoding mouse E-CD antisense cDNA into the E24 cell clone . The transfectant P1-clones obtained with reduced or absent E-CD expression showed increased levels of P14780 gelatinase , motility in vitro , and metastatic potential in vivo . Expression of P14780 in the various cell clones was also negatively modulated by cell density , but this effect was much stronger in E-CD ( + ) cells , despite the fact that all of the cell clones analyzed maintained the expression of P22223 and made cell-cell contacts at high cell density . Our results indicate that in this cell system , the E-CD-mediated cell-cell contacts are involved in the down-regulation of P14780 expression . Thus , the loss of E-CD triggers a migratory and invasive phenotype in mouse squamous carcinoma cells .
