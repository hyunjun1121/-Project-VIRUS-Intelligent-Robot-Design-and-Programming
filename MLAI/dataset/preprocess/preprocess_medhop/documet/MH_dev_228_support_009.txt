Q8N1N2 -spectrum antioxidant therapy featuring astaxanthin coupled with lipoprivic strategies and salsalate for management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Owing to the worldwide epidemic of obesity , and the popularity of diets rich in sugar and saturated fat , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is increasingly common ; it is usually associated with insulin resistance , and may be considered a component of the metabolic syndrome . The pathologies which can complicate hepatic steatosis -- steatohepatitis , cirrhosis , and hepatic cancer -- appear to result from an interaction of hepatic lipid overload and hepatic oxidative stress . It is therefore proposed that comprehensive regimens which effectively target each of these precipitating factors should achieve the best therapeutic benefit in NAFLD . Appropriate weight loss , and a diet low in saturated fat , glycemic index , and added sugars , should decrease hepatic lipid load . Measures which enhance adipocyte insulin sensitivity -- such as pioglitazone , astaxanthin , and spirulina -- may also be helpful in this regard , as may agents that boost hepatocyte capacity for fatty acid oxidation , such as metformin , carnitine , hydroxycitrate , long-chain omega-3 fats , and glycine . Astaxanthin and spirulina appear to have considerable potential for controlling the oxidative stress associated with NAFLD - the former because it may help to prevent the mitochondrial damage that renders mitochondria a key source of superoxide in this syndrome , the latter because it is exceptionally rich in phycocyanobilin , a phytochemical inhibitor of NAPDH oxidase . Other antioxidants which show some promise in this syndrome include high-dose folate , lipoic acid , melatonin , DB06151 , vitamin E , and taurine . Finally , treatment with salsalate , an inhibitor of O15111 -beta , has potential for blunting the adverse impact of hepatic steatosis on oxidative stress and inflammation .
