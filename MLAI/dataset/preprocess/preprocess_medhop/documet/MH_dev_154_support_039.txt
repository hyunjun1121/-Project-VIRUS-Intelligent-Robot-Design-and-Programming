P07996 and transforming growth factor beta-1 upregulate plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in pancreatic cancer . Controlled degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteases is crucial in tumor cell invasion . We have shown that thrombospondin-1 ( P07996 -1 ) , through activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 ( TGF-beta1 ) , regulates the plasminogen/plasmin protease system in breast cancer . To determine whether this occurred in other epithelial neoplasms , we studied the role of P07996 -1 and TGF-beta1 in the regulation of the plasminogen/plasmin system in pancreatic cancer . ASPC-1 and COLO-357 pancreatic cancer cells were treated with P07996 -1 or TGF-beta1 at varying concentrations . The P07996 -1 and TGF-beta1-treated cells were also treated with either anti- P07996 -1 , anti- P07996 -1 receptor , or anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) expression was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . P07996 -1 and TGF-beta1 promoted a dose-dependent upregulation of ASPC-1 and COLO-357 P05121 expression . The P07996 -1 effect could be blocked with anti- P07996 -1 or anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies . The TGF-beta1 effect could be blocked only with anti-TGF-beta1 antibody . Anti- P07996 -1 receptor antibody blocked the P07996 -1 effect on P05121 expression but had no effect on TGF-beta1-mediated P05121 expression . Neither P07996 -1 nor TGF-beta1 had an effect on uPA production . We conclude that P07996 -1 , in a receptor-mediated process that involves the activation of TGF-beta1 , upregulates P05121 expression in pancreatic cancer without an effect on uPA production .
