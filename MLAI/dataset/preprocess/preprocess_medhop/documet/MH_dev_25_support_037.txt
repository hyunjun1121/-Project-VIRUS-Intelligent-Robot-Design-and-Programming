Production and characterization of DB06681 , a variant of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin , in Pichia pastoris . Blocking the P10747 / P33681 costimulatory pathway is a promising strategy in the treatment of graft rejection , graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune diseases . DB06681 , a high-affinity variant of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin ( DB01281 ) , is a more potent inhibitor of the interaction between P10747 and P33681 than is DB01281 . In a previous study , DB06681 was produced in a mammalian cell system , which is time-consuming and expensive . To obtain DB06681 more efficiently and cost effectively , we attempted to produce DB06681 using a Pichia pastoris expression system . The gene encoding DB06681 , with an additional 6- DB00117 tag at the N-terminus , was cloned into the yeast vector pPIC9K and expressed in the P. pastoris strain GS115 . Under the optimized induction conditions for protein expression ( inoculum density , OD(600) = 80 ; methanol concentration added daily , 1.0-3.0 % ; induction time point , 72-96 h ; culture medium pH = 6.0 ) , the yield of purified DB06681 was approximately 30 mg l(-1) by one-step Ni-agarose affinity chromatography . Q96IV0 F treatment showed the purified DB06681 to be post-translational modified by N-linked glycosylation . In biological function assays , DB06681 expressed in P. pastoris demonstrated specific binding to P33681 -1/ P33681 -2-positive Raji cells and also suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . These results suggest that DB06681 produced in P. pastoris is biologically active and will be useful for experimental therapy on immunotherapy for transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases .
