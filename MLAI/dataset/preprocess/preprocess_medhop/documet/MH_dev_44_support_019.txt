Use of plasma somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I measurements to monitor the response to nutritional repletion in malnourished patients . Changes in plasma somatomedia-C/insulin-like growth factor I ( Sm-C/ P05019 ) concentrations are a sensitive indicator of the anabolic response of normal human volunteers to alterations in nutritional intake . To determine if measurement of this peptide could be used to monitor the response to nutritional repletion in malnourished patients , six patients were studied while receiving nutritional support for periods of 10-16 days . Plasma Sm-C/ P05019 increased from a mean basal level of 0.67 +/- 0.15 U/ml ( +/-1 SD ) to a peak of 1.80 +/- 0.44 U/ml on day 10 , then declined to a concentration of 1.28 +/- 0.49 U/ml by day 16 . All patients entered positive nitrogen balance by day 2 and nitrogen accretion continued throughout the study . Changes in serum concentrations of prealbumin , transferrin , and retinol-binding protein were compared to changes in Sm-C/ P05019 during nutritional support . P02766 increased to a posttreatment mean of 121 +/- 23 % of control by the end of the study ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . Likewise , there was minimal change in retinol-binding protein , a peak value of 118 +/- 21 % of control being reached by day 12 of treatment ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . P02787 also showed minimal change , increasing to a mean value of 110 % +/- 13 % of control by day 12 ( p greater than 0.05 , NS ) . Measurement of plasma Sm-C/ P05019 concentrations appears to be a much more sensitive index of acute directional changes in nutritional status than other plasma proteins commonly used to monitor nutritional responses . The increase of Sm-C/ P05019 correlated temporally with entry into positive nitrogen balance. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
