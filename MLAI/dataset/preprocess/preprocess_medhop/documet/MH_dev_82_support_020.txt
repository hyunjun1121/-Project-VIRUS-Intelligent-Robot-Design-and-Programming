Serum amyloid A activates the Q96P20 inflammasome via Q99572 receptor and a cathepsin B-sensitive pathway . Serum amyloid A ( P0DJI8 ) is an acute-phase protein , the serum levels of which can increase up to 1000-fold during inflammation . P0DJI8 has a pathogenic role in amyloid A-type amyloidosis , and increased serum levels of P0DJI8 correlate with the risk for cardiovascular diseases . IL-1β is a key proinflammatory cytokine , and its secretion is strictly controlled by the inflammasomes . We studied the role of P0DJI8 in the regulation of IL-1β production and activation of the inflammasome cascade in human and mouse macrophages , as well as in THP-1 cells . P0DJI8 could provide a signal for the induction of pro-IL-1β expression and for inflammasome activation , resulting in secretion of mature IL-1β . Blocking O60603 and O00206 attenuated P0DJI8 -induced expression of P01584 , whereas inhibition of caspase-1 and the DB00171 receptor P2X(7) abrogated the release of mature IL-1β . Q96P20 inflammasome consists of the Q96P20 receptor and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD ( a caspase-recruitment domain ) ( ASC ) . P0DJI8 -mediated IL-1β secretion was markedly reduced in ASC(-/-) macrophages , and silencing Q96P20 decreased IL-1β secretion , confirming Q96P20 as the P0DJI8 -responsive inflammasome . Inflammasome activation was dependent on cathepsin B activity , but it was not associated with lysosomal destabilization . P0DJI8 also induced secretion of cathepsin B and ASC . In conclusion , P0DJI8 can induce the expression of pro-IL-1β and activation of the Q96P20 inflammasome via P2X(7) receptor and a cathepsin B-sensitive pathway . Thus , during systemic inflammation , P0DJI8 may promote the production of IL-1β in tissues . Furthermore , the P0DJI8 -induced secretion of active cathepsin B may lead to extracellular processing of P0DJI8 and , thus , potentially to the development of amyloid A amyloidosis .
