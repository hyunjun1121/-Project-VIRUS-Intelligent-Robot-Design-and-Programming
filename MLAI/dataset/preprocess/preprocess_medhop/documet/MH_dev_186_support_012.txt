DB01079 inhibits the serotonin transporter P31645 . BACKGROUND : DB01079 is a novel drug for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome . DB01079 is thought to exert its prokinetic effect as a selective partial agonist of serotonin receptor type 4 ( Q13639 ) receptors located in the enteric nervous system . It is unknown , however , whether tegaserod interacts with the human serotonin reuptake transporter ( hSERT ) and the uptake transporters for dopamine ( hDAT ) and norepinephrine ( hNET ) . Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate whether tegaserod inhibits P31645 - , Q01959 - , and NET-mediated transport . METHODS : DB01079 inhibition of P31645 -mediated [3H]5-HT and NET- and Q01959 -mediated [3H]dopamine uptake was measured in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells stably expressing hSERT , hDAT , and hNET in comparison with untransfected control HEK293-FT cells . RESULTS : DB01079 inhibited P31645 - , Q01959 - , and NET-mediated transport with IC50-values of 11.7 , 20.7 , and 3.2 micromol/l , respectively , while 100 micromol/l estrone-3-sulfate or taurocholic acid , used as negative controls , failed to inhibit hSERT-mediated transport . Using Dixon plot analysis , inhibition kinetics yielded a non-competitive type of inhibition with an apparent inhibition constant ( Ki ) of 3.1 micromol/l for P31645 -mediated 5-HT transport . CONCLUSION : In the present study we propose an additional mechanism of action for tegaserod as a serotonin uptake inhibitor . By inhibiting P31645 and increasing local 5-HT concentrations in the gut wall , tegaserod might exert its prokinetic action via a synergism between Q13639 agonism and low-affinity P31645 inhibition .
