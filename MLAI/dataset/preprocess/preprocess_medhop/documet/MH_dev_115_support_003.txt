IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 enhance human beta-defensin-2 production in human keratinocytes . IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 , which are produced by P25054 , modulate innate and adaptive immunities . Human beta-defensin-2 ( O15263 ) produced by epidermal keratinocytes promotes cutaneous antimicrobial defense and inflammation . We examined the in vitro effects of IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 on O15263 production in human keratinocytes . IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 enhanced IL-1beta-induced O15263 secretion and mRNA expression in keratinocytes . The stimulatory effects of IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 were suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides against NF-kappaB p50 and p65 . In addition , the effects of IL-12 and Q8TAD2 were suppressed by antisense P40763 and P42224 , respectively . All the three IL enhanced the basal and IL-1beta-induced transcriptional activities of NF-kappaB , while IL-12 and Q8TAD2 enhanced P40763 and P42224 activities , respectively . Further , IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 promoted basal and IL-1beta-induced phosphorylation of P25963 . IL-12 and IL-23 tyrosine phosphorylated P40763 and P42224 , respectively ; IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 tyrosine phosphorylated O60674 and tyrosine kinase-2 ; and Q8TAD2 tyrosine phosphorylated P23458 . These results suggest that IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 may enhance IL-1beta-induced O15263 production in keratinocytes by activating NF-kappaB . P40763 and P42224 are involved in the effects of IL-12 and Q8TAD2 , respectively . Thus , IL-12 , IL-23 , and Q8TAD2 may promote cutaneous antimicrobial defense and inflammation via O15263 .
