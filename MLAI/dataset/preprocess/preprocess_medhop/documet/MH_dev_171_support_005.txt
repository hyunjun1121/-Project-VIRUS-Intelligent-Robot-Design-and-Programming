PSK , a novel Q9H2G2 derived from prostatic carcinoma that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and regulates actin cytoskeletal organization . Degenerate polymerase chain reaction against conserved kinase catalytic subdomains identified 15 tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases expressed in surgically removed prostatic carcinoma tissues , including six receptor kinases ( PDGFBR , IGF1-R , P35968 , MET , P34925 , and P21709 -A1 ) , six non-receptor kinases ( P00519 , P23458 , O60674 , P29597 , P53350 , and EMK ) , and three novel kinases . Several of these kinases are oncogenic , and may function in the development of prostate cancer . One of the novel kinases is a new member of the sterile 20 ( STE20 ) family of serine-threonine kinases which we have called prostate-derived Q9H2G2 ( PSK ) and characterized functionally . PSK encodes an open reading frame of 3705 nucleotides and contains an N-terminal kinase domain . Immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylates myelin basic protein and transfected PSK stimulates P45985 and O14733 and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . Microinjection of PSK into cells results in localization of PSK to a vesicular compartment and causes a marked reduction in actin stress fibers . In contrast , C-terminally truncated PSK ( 1-349 ) did not localize to this compartment or induce a decrease in stress fibers demonstrating a requirement for the C terminus . Kinase-defective PSK ( K57A ) was unable to reduce stress fibers . PSK is the first member of the STE20 family lacking a Cdc42/Rac binding domain that has been shown to regulate both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the actin cytoskeleton .
