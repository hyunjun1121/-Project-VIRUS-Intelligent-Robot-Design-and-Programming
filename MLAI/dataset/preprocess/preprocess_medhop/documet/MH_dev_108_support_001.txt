Targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . BACKGROUND : Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease triggered and maintained by inflammatory mediators , including P01375 . OBJECTIVE/METHODS : To summarize the role of anti- P01375 agents psoriasis therapy , focusing on the mechanisms and biological pathways involved , by reviewing relevant literature . RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS : The three P01375 antagonists currently available ( etanercept , infliximab and adalimumab ) are effective in the therapy of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . DB08904 and DB06674 are P01375 inhibitors not approved for therapy of psoriasis yet . In addition to neutralizing soluble P01375 , P01375 blockers bind to membrane P01375 and change the behavior of P01375 -expressing cells , resulting in hastened cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , and suppression of cytokine production . P01375 blockers may also affect adaptive immune responses by reducing T helper cell (Th)1 and Th17 responses , and favoring the development of T-regulatory cells . P01375 antagonists can regulate differentiation and activation of osteoclasts , thus reducing bone destruction in psoriatic arthritis . Anti- P01375 agents differ in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodinamic properties , which is reflected in their therapeutic and safety profiles . The safety of P01375 antagonists has been established , and patient selection and monitoring allow risk minimization .
