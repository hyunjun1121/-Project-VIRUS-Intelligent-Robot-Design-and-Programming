Role of acetylation and extracellular location of heat shock protein 90alpha in tumor cell invasion . Heat shock protein ( hsp ) 90 is an DB00171 -dependent molecular chaperone that maintains the active conformation of client oncoproteins in cancer cells . An isoform , hsp90alpha , promotes extracellular maturation of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 , involved in tumor invasion and metastasis . Knockdown of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 6 , which deacetylates lysine residues in hsp90 , induces reversible hyperacetylation and attenuates DB00171 binding and chaperone function of hsp90 . Here , using mass spectrometry , we identified seven lysine residues in hsp90alpha that are hyperacetylated after treatment of eukaryotic cells with a pan-HDAC inhibitor that also inhibits Q9UBN7 . Depending on the specific lysine residue in the middle domain involved , although acetylation affects DB00171 , cochaperone , and client protein binding to hsp90alpha , acetylation of all seven lysines increased the binding of hsp90alpha to 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy geldanamycin . Notably , after treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor DB06603 ( LBH589 ) , the extracellular hsp90alpha was hyperacetylated and it bound to P08253 , which was associated with increased in vitro tumor cell invasiveness . Treatment with antiacetylated hsp90alpha antibody inhibited in vitro invasion by tumor cells . Thus , reversible hyperacetylation modulates the intracellular and extracellular chaperone function of hsp90 , and targeting extracellular hyperacetylated hsp90alpha may undermine tumor invasion and metastasis .
