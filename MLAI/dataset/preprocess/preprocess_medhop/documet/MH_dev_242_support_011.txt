delta- DB00855 dehydratase ( P13716 ) porphyria : the first case in North America with two novel P13716 mutations . The molecular basis of the enzymatic defect responsible for delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase ( P13716 ) porphyria ( ADP ) was investigated in a 14-year-old male who presented clinical and laboratory findings typical of ADP . Nucleotide sequence analysis of P13716 cDNAs from the proband revealed two novel mutations , a 265G to A base transition ( C1 ) and a 394C to T base transition ( P06681 ) , resulting in amino acid substitutions , Glu89Lys and Cys132Arg , respectively . Both mutations were present within exon 5 of the P13716 gene , and appeared to influence the binding of zinc to the enzyme which is essential for enzyme activity . It was found that the C1 mutation was inherited from his father , while the P06681 mutation was from his mother . Expression of these mutant P13716 cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced normal P13716 mRNA levels , but markedly decreased P13716 protein and enzyme activity . These results suggest that the combination of the two aberrant ALADs with little enzyme activity accounts for the markedly decreased P13716 activity observed in the proband . This case represents the molecular analysis of the P13716 gene defects in the first case of ADP identified in North America , who is a compound heterozygote for two novel P13716 gene defects .
