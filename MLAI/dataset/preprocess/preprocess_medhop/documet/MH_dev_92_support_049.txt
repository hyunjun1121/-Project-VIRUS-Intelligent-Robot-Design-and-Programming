Substrate specificity of human carnitine acetyltransferase : Implications for fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism . DB00583 acyltransferases catalyze the reversible conversion of acyl-CoAs into acylcarnitine esters . This family includes the mitochondrial enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 ( P23786 ) and carnitine acetyltransferase ( P43155 ) . P23786 is part of the carnitine shuttle that is necessary to import fatty acids into mitochondria and catalyzes the conversion of acylcarnitines into acyl-CoAs . In addition , when mitochondrial fatty acid Î²-oxidation is impaired , P23786 is able to catalyze the reverse reaction and converts accumulating long- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs into acylcarnitines for export from the matrix to the cytosol . However , P23786 is inactive with short-chain acyl-CoAs and intermediates of the branched-chain amino acid oxidation pathway ( BCAAO ) . In order to explore the origin of short-chain and branched-chain acylcarnitines that may accumulate in various organic acidemias , we performed substrate specificity studies using purified recombinant human P43155 . Various saturated , unsaturated and branched-chain acyl- DB01992 esters were tested and the synthesized acylcarnitines were quantified by P19957 -MS/MS . We show that P43155 converts short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs ( P06681 to Q99622 - DB01992 ) , whereas no activity was observed with long-chain species . Trans-2-enoyl- DB01992 intermediates were found to be poor substrates for this enzyme . Furthermore , P43155 turned out to be active towards some but not all the BCAAO intermediates tested and no activity was found with dicarboxylic acyl- DB01992 esters . This suggests the existence of another enzyme able to handle the acyl-CoAs that are not substrates for P43155 and P23786 , but for which the corresponding acylcarnitines are well recognized as diagnostic markers in inborn errors of metabolism .
