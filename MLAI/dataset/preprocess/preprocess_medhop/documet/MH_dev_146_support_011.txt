DB08875 : a MET , P07949 , and P35968 tyrosine kinase inhibitor . DB08875 is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against MET , P35968 , P36888 , c- P10721 , and P07949 . Activity of cabozantinib toward a broad range of tumor models could be detected in several preclinical studies . Of note , cabozantinib decreases metastasis potential and tumor invasiveness when compared with placebo or agents that target VEGFR and have no activity against MET . Clinical phase I and II studies with cabozantinib have been conducted in various malignancies including medullary thyroid cancer ( P04629 ) , NSCLC , breast , ovarian , pancreatic , and prostate cancer . In P04629 , gain of function mutations of P07949 are central for tumorigenesis . Hereditary forms of P04629 ( MEN II ) are caused by germline mutations of P07949 , in sporadic P04629 in up to 50 % of cases P07949 mutations occur . Additionally , activating molecular changes in VEGFR and MET pathways have also been implicated in P04629 progression . Clinical responses with cabozantinib in P04629 could be observed in early clinical trials , and following confirmation of clinical benefit in a randomized phase III trial , cabozantinib gained FDA approval for first-line treatment of advanced P04629 in 2012 . In prostate cancer models , MET expression increases with androgen ablation and clinical progression of bone and lymph node metastasis . A phase II trial with cabozantinib also showed very promising response rates in patients with metastatic prostate cancer . Therefore , randomized phase III studies are currently ongoing to validate the efficacy of cabozantinib in heavily pretreated prostate cancer patients .
