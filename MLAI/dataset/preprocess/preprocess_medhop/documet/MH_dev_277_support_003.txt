Exendin-4 decreases amphetamine-induced locomotor activity . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) is released in response to nutrient ingestion and is a regulator of energy metabolism and consummatory behaviors through both peripheral and central mechanisms . The P43220 ( P43220 ) is widely distributed in the central nervous system , however little is known about how GLP-1Rs regulate ambulatory behavior . The abused psychostimulant amphetamine ( P49418 ) promotes behavioral locomotor activity primarily by inducing the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine . Here , we identify the P43220 agonist exendin-4 ( Ex-4 ) as a modulator of behavioral activation by P49418 . We report that in rats a single acute administration of Ex-4 decreases both basal locomotor activity as well as P49418 -induced locomotor activity . Ex-4 did not induce behavioral responses reflecting anxiety or aversion . Our findings implicate P43220 signaling as a novel modulator of psychostimulant-induced behavior and therefore a potential therapeutic target for psychostimulant abuse .
