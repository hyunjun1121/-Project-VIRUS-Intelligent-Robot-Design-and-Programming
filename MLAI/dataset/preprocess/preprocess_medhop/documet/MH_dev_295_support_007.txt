Multipotent stem/progenitor cells in human biliary tree give rise to hepatocytes , cholangiocytes , and pancreatic islets . Multipotent stem/progenitors are present in peribiliary glands of extrahepatic biliary trees from humans of all ages and in high numbers in hepato-pancreatic common duct , cystic duct , and hilum . They express endodermal transcription factors ( e.g. , Sox9 , Q9H6I2 , Q9Y261 , PDX1 , HES1 , Q9Y4Z2 , Q92786 ) intranuclearly , stem/progenitor surface markers ( EpCAM , P13591 , CD133 , P61073 ) , and sometimes weakly adult liver , bile duct , and pancreatic genes ( albumin , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [ P13569 ] , and insulin ) . They clonogenically expand on plastic and in serum-free medium , tailored for endodermal progenitors , remaining phenotypically stable as undifferentiated cells for months with a cell division initially every â‰ˆ36 hours and slowing to one every 2-3 days . Transfer into distinct culture conditions , each comprised of a specific mix of hormones and matrix components , yields either cords of hepatocytes ( express albumin , P08684 , and transferrin ) , branching ducts of cholangiocytes ( expressing anion exchanger-2- P04920 and P13569 ) , or regulatable C-peptide secreting neoislet-like clusters ( expressing glucagon , insulin ) and accompanied by changes in gene expression correlating with the adult fate . Transplantation into quiescent livers of immunocompromised mice results in functional human hepatocytes and cholangiocytes , whereas if into fat pads of streptozocin-induced diabetic mice , results in functional islets secreting glucose-regulatable human C-peptide . CONCLUSION : The phenotypes and availability from all age donors suggest that these stem/progenitors have considerable potential for regenerative therapies of liver , bile duct , and pancreatic diseases including diabetes .
