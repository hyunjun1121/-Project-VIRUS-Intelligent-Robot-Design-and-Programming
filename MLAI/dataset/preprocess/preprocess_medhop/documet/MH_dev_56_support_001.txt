DB00005 ( Enbrel ) : update on therapeutic use . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) is an important inflammatory disease mediator in a wide spectrum of articular diseases , including adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( RA , JRA ) . DB00005 ( Enbrel ) , approved in the United States and in Europe for use in patients with RA and JRA , is an effective inhibitor of P01375 that has been shown to provide rapid and sustained improvement in both of these diseases . Long term studies continue to show that etanercept controls signs and symptoms of RA and JRA with no change in rate or type of adverse event over time . To demonstrate that etanercept is effective as first line treatment for patients with early active RA who have not been previously treated with methotrexate , and to examine the effect of etanercept on radiographic progression , a double blind , placebo controlled study was recently conducted , comparing etanercept with methotrexate ( median dose 20 mg per week ) . Both etanercept 25 mg twice weekly and rapidly escalated methotrexate were effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA , and etanercept was significantly better than methotrexate in slowing the rate of radiographic erosions . In patients with severe psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) , a double blind , placebo controlled study demonstrated that etanercept was also effective in reducing disease activity in PsA . DB00005 has been well tolerated in all of these clinical trials and offers an important new treatment option to patients with inflammatory articular diseases .
