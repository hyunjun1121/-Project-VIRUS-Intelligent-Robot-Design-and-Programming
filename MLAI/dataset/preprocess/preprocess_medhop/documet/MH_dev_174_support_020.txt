Identification and functional signature of genes regulated by structurally different P00519 kinase inhibitors . Dasatinib is an DB00171 -competitive , multi-targeted P12931 and P00519 kinase inhibitor that can bind P11274 - P00519 in both the active and inactive conformations . From a clinical standpoint , dasatinib is particularly attractive because it has been shown to induce hematologic and cytogenetic responses in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients . The fact because the combination of imatinib and dasatinib shows the additive/synergistic growth inhibition on wild-type Q92817 P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells , we reasoned that these P00519 kinase inhibitors might induce the different molecular pathways . To address this question , we used DNA microarrays to identify genes whose transcription was altered by imatinib and dasatinib . K562 cells were cultured with imatinib or dasatinib for 16 h , and gene expression data were obtained from three independent microarray hybridizations . Almost all of the imatinib- and dasatinib-responsive genes appeared to be similarly increased or decreased in K562 cells ; however , small subsets of genes were identified as selectively altered expression by either imatinib or dasatinib . The distinct genes that are selectively modulated by dasatinib are cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( P24941 ) and P49336 , which had a maximal reduction of < 5-fold in microarray screen . To assess the functional importance of dasatinib regulated genes , we used RNA interference to determine whether reduction of P24941 and P49336 affected the growth inhibition . K562 and TF-1BCR- P00519 cells , pretreated with P24941 or P49336 small interfering RNA , showed additive growth inhibition with imatinib , but not with dasatinib . These findings demonstrate that the additive/synergistic growth inhibition by imatinib and dasatinib may be mediated in part by P24941 and P49336 .
