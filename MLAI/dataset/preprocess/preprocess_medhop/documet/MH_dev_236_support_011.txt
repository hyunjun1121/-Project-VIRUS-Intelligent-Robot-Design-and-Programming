P04626 mRNA status contributes to the discrepancy between gene amplification and protein overexpression in gastric cancer . BACKGROUND : Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) is an important proto-oncogene of prognostic use in gastric cancer ( GC ) . Fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) are the main clinical methods of detection of P04626 , but consistency between the methods is poor and the cause of the discrepancy is unclear . AIM : To investigate the involvement of P04626 mRNA status in the disparity between gene amplification and protein overexpression . METHODS : We investigated P04626 gene , mRNA , and protein profiles in gastric precancer and cancer tissues by use of the molecular approaches Q5TCZ1 , real-time polymerase chain reaction , and IHC . The relationships between P04626 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( P14780 ) and O15105 expression were analyzed and the involvement of P04626 in the interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes was investigated by coculturing GC cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) . RESULTS : P04626 protein expression was significantly increased in cancer compared with precancer ( P = 0.003 ) , and the corresponding mRNA levels were significantly lower in precancer and cancer tissues than in normal tissues ( Îº = 0.290 , P = 0.025 ) . P04626 mRNA levels were significantly higher in tumor than in peritumor tissue ( P = 0.028 ) , and were positively correlated with P14780 and O15105 mRNA levels in tumor tissues . P04626 mRNA expression in GC cell lines was increased by coculture with PBMCs . CONCLUSIONS : Different P04626 mRNA profiles , possibly in relation to contact between tumor cells and lymphocytes , might help to explain the discrepancy between gene amplification and protein overexpression results .
