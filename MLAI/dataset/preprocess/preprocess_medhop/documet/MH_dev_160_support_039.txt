Usefulness of QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test in psoriatic patients under treatment with tumour necrosis factor blockers . OBJECTIVE : DB00065 is a human/mouse chimeric anti-tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α antibody that is effective in the management of psoriasis . Anti- P01375 treatments may reactivate latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) ; therefore , screening for LTBI is mandatory before starting any anti- P01375 -α therapy . The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold ( QFT-G ) test in psoriatic patients under treatment with infliximab . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : A retrospective study had been performed on patients affected by psoriasis who had been treated with infliximab from 2003 to 2012 at a single centre . MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES : QFT-G was tested by a standard TB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , based on detection of interferon-γ release from sensitized leucocytes exposed to the synthetic Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens at baseline and every 6 months until the end of treatment . RESULTS : A total of 140 patients were included . At baseline , 7 QFT-G tests were positive and 133 tests were negative . Of the 133 patients , 11 ( 8 % ) who were negative at baseline became QFT-G test positive during treatment . Of those 11 patients , 5 had a reversion during treatment . Of the 133 patients , 122 ( 92 % ) who were negative at baseline remained negative . CONCLUSIONS : It was found that the development of positive QFT-G tests , observed in 8 % treated with infliximab , was not associated with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis .
