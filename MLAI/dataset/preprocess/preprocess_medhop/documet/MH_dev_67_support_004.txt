Wheat germ agglutinin behaves as a DB00644 antagonist but induces gonadotrope desensitization . Preincubation of cultured rat pituitary cells with 10 micrograms/ml of either wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) or concanavalin A inhibited LH release stimulated with DB00644 ( 0.5 nM ) by 55 % and 40 % , respectively . WGA-inhibition of LH release stimulated by DB00644 was dose-dependent , reaching a plateau of 75 % inhibition at 50 micrograms/ml . Concomitantly , WGA induced a dose-dependent inhibition of 125I- DB06719 specific binding to pituitary cells , with a maximal inhibition of 45 % . The inhibition of 125I- DB06719 binding by WGA is due to P30968 internalization and not to persistent occupancy of the receptors . In addition to the effect of WGA on receptor internalization , WGA also induced partial desensitization of pituitary cells but was ineffective in modulating DB00644 -induced desensitization . These findings indicate that WGA has all the characteristics of a DB00644 antagonist , nevertheless , it does induce desensitization of cultured rat pituitary cells to further stimulation with DB00644 .
