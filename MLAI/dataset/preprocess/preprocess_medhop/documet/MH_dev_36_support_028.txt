DB01233 stimulates catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretion from pheochromocytoma cells through activation of serotonin type 4 ( Q13639 ) receptors . The gastroprokinetic agent metoclopramide is known to stimulate catecholamine secretion from pheochromocytomas . The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanism of action of metoclopramide and expression of serotonin type 4 ( 5-HT(4) ) receptors in pheochromocytoma tissues . Tissue explants , obtained from 18 pheochromocytomas including the tumor removed from a 46-year-old female patient who experienced life-threatening hypertension crisis after metoclopramide administration and 17 additional pheochromocytomas ( 9 benign and 8 malignant ) were studied . Cultured pheochromocytoma cells derived from the patient who previously received metoclopramide were incubated with metoclopramide and various 5-HT(4) receptor ligands . In addition , total mRNAs were extracted from all the 18 tumors . Catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide concentrations were measured in pheochromocytoma cell incubation medium by HPLC and radioimmunological assays . In addition , expression of 5-HT(4) receptor mRNAs in the 18 pheochromocytomas was investigated by the use of reverse transcriptase-PCR . RESULTS : DB01233 and the 5-HT(4) receptor agonist cisapride were found to activate catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretions by cultured tumor cells . DB01233 - and cisapride-evoked catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide productions were inhibited by the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist GR 113808 . 5-HT(4) receptor mRNAs were detected in the patient 's tumor and the series of 17 additional pheochromocytomas . This study shows that pheochromocytomas express functional 5-HT(4) receptors that are responsible for the stimulatory action of metoclopramide on catecholamine- and granin-derived peptide secretion . All 5-HT(4) receptor agonists must therefore be contraindicated in patients with proven or suspected pheochromocytoma .
