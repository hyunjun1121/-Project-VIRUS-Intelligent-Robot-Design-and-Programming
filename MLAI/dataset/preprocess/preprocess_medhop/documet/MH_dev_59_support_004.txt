Prospective analysis of adrenal function in patients with acute exacerbations of P48444 : the Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated P48444 ( REDUCE ) trial . OBJECTIVE : To analyze prospectively the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis and clinical outcome in patients treated with prednisone for exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . DESIGN : Prospective observational study . SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Patients presenting to the emergency department were randomized to receive 40 mg prednisone daily for 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled manner . The Q9Y251 axis was longitudinally assessed with the 1 μg corticotropin test and a clinical hypocortisolism score at baseline , on day 6 before blinded treatment , at hospital discharge , and for up to 180 days of follow-up . DB00635 was stopped abruptly , irrespective of the test results . Patients discharged with pathological test results received instructions about emergency hydrocortisone treatment . RESULTS : A total of 311 patients were included in the analysis . Mean basal and stimulated serum total cortisol levels were highest on admission ( 496±398 and 816±413 nmol/l respectively ) and lowest on day 6 ( 235±174 and 453±178 nmol/l respectively ) . Pathological stimulation tests were found in 63 , 38 , 9 , 3 , and 2 % of patients on day 6 , at discharge , and on days 30 , 90 , and 180 respectively , without significant difference between treatment groups . Clinical indicators of hypocortisolism did not correlate with stimulation test results , but cortisol levels were inversely associated with re-exacerbation risk . There were no hospitalizations or deaths as a result of adrenal crisis . CONCLUSION : Dynamic changes in the Q9Y251 axis occur during and after the treatment of acute exacerbations of P48444 . In hypocortisolemic patients who were provided with instructions about stress prophylaxis , the abrupt termination of prednisone appeared safe .
