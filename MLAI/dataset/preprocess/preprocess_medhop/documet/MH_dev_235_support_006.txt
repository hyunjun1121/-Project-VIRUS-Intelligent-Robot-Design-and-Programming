A mechanism for the synergistic antimalarial action of atovaquone and proguanil . A combination of atovaquone and proguanil has been found to be quite effective in treating malaria , with little evidence of the emergence of resistance when atovaquone was used as a single agent . We have examined possible mechanisms for the synergy between these two drugs . While proguanil by itself had no effect on electron transport or mitochondrial membrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , it significantly enhanced the ability of atovaquone to collapse DeltaPsim when used in combination . This enhancement was observed at pharmacologically achievable doses . DB01131 acted as a biguanide rather than as its metabolite cycloguanil ( a parasite dihydrofolate reductase [ P00374 ] inhibitor ) to enhance the atovaquone effect ; another P00374 inhibitor , pyrimethamine , also had no enhancing effect . DB01131 -mediated enhancement was specific for atovaquone , since the effects of other mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors , such as myxothiazole and antimycin , were not altered by inclusion of proguanil . Surprisingly , proguanil did not enhance the ability of atovaquone to inhibit mitochondrial electron transport in malaria parasites . These results suggest that proguanil in its prodrug form acts in synergy with atovaquone by lowering the effective concentration at which atovaquone collapses DeltaPsim in malaria parasites . This could explain the paradoxical success of the atovaquone-proguanil combination even in regions where proguanil alone is ineffective due to resistance . The results also suggest that the atovaquone-proguanil combination may act as a site-specific uncoupler of parasite mitochondria in a selective manner .
