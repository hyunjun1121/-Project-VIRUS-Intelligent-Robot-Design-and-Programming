Unsaturated side chain beta-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol analogs . The cannabinoid side chain is a key pharmacophore in the interaction of cannabinoids with their receptors ( P21554 and CB2 ) . To study the stereochemical requirements of the side chain , we synthesized a series of cannabinoids in which rotation around the C1'- P06681 ' bond is blocked . The key steps in the synthesis were the cuprate addition of a substituted resorcinol to (+)-apoverbenone , the TMSOTf-mediated formation of the dihydropyran ring , and the stereospecific introduction of the beta-11-hydroxymethyl group . All the analogs tested showed nanomolar affinity for the receptors , the cis-hept-1-ene side chain having the highest affinity for P21554 ( Ki = 0.89 nM ) and showing the widest separation between P21554 and CB2 affinities . The parent n-heptyl-beta-11-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol was the least potent binding to P21554 ( Ki = 8.9 nM ) and had the lowest selectivity between P21554 and CB2 .
