15-deoxy-Δ¹²,¹⁴-PGJ₂ promotes inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via the Q14188 /MAPK/ P01375 α axis . BACKGROUND : Prostaglandins ( PGs ) , lipid autacoids derived from arachidonic acid , play a pivotal role during inflammation . P52209 ₂ synthase is abundantly expressed in heart tissue and P52209 ₂ has recently been found to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis . P52209 ₂ is an unstable prostanoid metabolite ; therefore the objective of the present study was to elucidate whether its final dehydration product , 15-deoxy-Δ¹²,¹⁴-PGJ₂ ( 15d-PGJ₂ , present at high levels in ischemic myocardium ) might cause cardiomyocyte damage . METHODS AND RESULTS : Using specific (ant)agonists we show that 15d-PGJ₂ induced formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and phosphorylation of p38 and Q8NFH3 /44 MAPKs via the Q13258 Q14188 ( but not DP1 or Q07869 γ ) in the murine atrial cardiomyocyte P07306 cell line . Activation of the Q14188 -ROS-MAPK axis by 15d-PGJ₂ enhanced transcription and translation of P01375 α and induced apoptosis in P07306 cardiomyocytes . Silencing of P01375 α significantly attenuated the extrinsic ( caspase-8 ) and intrinsic apoptotic pathways ( bax and caspase-9 ) , caspase-3 activation and downstream PARP cleavage and γ P16104 activation . The apoptotic machinery was unaffected by intracellular calcium , transcription factor NF-κB and its downstream target p53 . Of note , 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ₂ ( lacking the electrophilic carbon atom in the cyclopentenone ring ) did not activate cellular responses . Selected experiments performed in primary murine cardiomyocytes confirmed data obtained in P07306 cells namely that the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascades are activated via Q14188 /MAPK/ P01375 α signaling . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that the reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group of 15d-PGJ₂ is responsible for the pronounced upregulation of P01375 α promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis . We propose that inhibition of Q14188 receptors could provide a possibility to modulate 15d-PGJ₂-induced myocardial injury .
