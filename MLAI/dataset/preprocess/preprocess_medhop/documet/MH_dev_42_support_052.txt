Antifibrotic activity of sorafenib in experimental hepatic fibrosis : refinement of inhibitory targets , dosing , and window of efficacy in vivo . BACKGROUND : DB00398 , which is approved for treatment of HCC , has also shown promising antifibrotic activity , and therefore refinement of its dosing requirements and window of efficacy are important goals prior to antifibrotic clinical trials . AIM : The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal effective dose and optimal timing of sorafenib therapy in cultured human stellate cells and in rats with experimental hepatic fibrosis . METHODS : Effects of sorafenib were assessed in a human stellate cell line ( LX-2 ) . In vivo , rats were treated for 8 weeks with TAA three times per week ( 150 mg/kg IP ) , and with either PBS or sorafenib administered daily at doses of 1.25 , 5 or 7 mg/kg/day gavage either at the beginning of TAA administration for 8 weeks , during weeks 4-8 , or from weeks 8-12 . RESULTS : DB00398 treatment significantly inhibited LX-2 proliferation by > 75 % ( 7.5 or 15 μM ) . Treatment with 7.5-μM sorafenib for 12 h markedly inhibited expression of TGFβ1 , P01033 , collagen I , and P08253 mRNAs , but not of β- P09619 or type I TGFβR . In vivo , sorafenib significantly inhibited liver fibrosis when started concurrently with TAA and during weeks 4-8 with TAA . In contrast , there was no significant effect of sorafenib on fibrogenic gene expression or fibrosis when begun after cirrhosis was already established . CONCLUSION : DB00398 is anti-proliferative and antifibrotic towards human HSCs in culture , and is a potent antifibrotic agent in TAA-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats . The drug is effective at relatively low doses at the early stage of liver fibrosis , but is not effective when cirrhosis is already established .
