Effects of neurosteroids on Ca(2+) signaling mediated by recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells . DB02789 sulfate ( PREGS ) potentiates the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor-mediated Ca(2+)-signals in cultured hippocampal neurons . The DB01221 receptor family has several different subunits whose expression in neurons has distinct spatial and temporal patterns . To examine subunit specificity of the PREGS action , we have investigated the effect of PREGS on recombinant GluR epsilon2/zeta1 ( Q13224 / Q9UHB4 ) type DB01221 receptors stabley expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using heat shock promoters . PREGS enhanced the Ca(2+) influx through the GluR epsilon2/zeta1 receptors in a dose-dependent manner . The EC(50) of PREGS for the GluR epsilon2/zeta1 receptors was 8.6 microM . Other sulfated neurosteroids , DB05804 ( DHEAS ) , 17beta-estradiol sulfate and 3alpha-ol-5beta-pregnan-20-one sulfate ( 3alpha5betaS ) , inhibited the positive modulatory effect of PREGS on the GluR epsilon2/zeta1 DB01221 receptors . DB08954 , a specific inhibitor of GluR epsilon2 subunit , abolished the DB01221 -induced Ca(2+) influx even in the presence of PREGS . These results imply that PREGS positively modulates the Ca(2+) influx through the GluR epsilon2/zeta1 receptors which are expressed from the embryonic period .
