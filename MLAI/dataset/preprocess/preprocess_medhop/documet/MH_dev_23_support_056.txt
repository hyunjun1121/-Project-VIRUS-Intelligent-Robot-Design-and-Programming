The effect of prenatal nicotine on mRNA of central cholinergic markers and hematological parameters in rat fetuses . A number of studies have demonstrated the influence of nicotine on fetal development . This study determined the expression of choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( Q16572 ) , and high-affinity choline transporter ( Q9GZV3 ) in the forebrain and hindbrain following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure in the rat fetus ( maternal rats were subcutaneously injected with nicotine at different gestation periods ) . We also measured the effect of chronic nicotine exposure on fetal blood pO(2) , pCO(2) , pH , Na(+) and K(+) concentrations , as well as lactic acid levels . Maternal nicotine exposure during pregnancy was associated with a decrease in fetal pO(2) coupled with a significant increase in pCO(2) and lactic acid as well as restricted fetal growth . Additionally , maternal nicotine administration also reduced P28329 , Q16572 , and Q9GZV3 mRNA levels in the fetal brain . DB00184 -induced fetal hypoxic responses and reduced cholinergic marker expression in the brain were more severe when nicotine was started in early gestation . Our results provide new information about the effects of repeated exposure to nicotine in utero on the expression of central P28329 , Q16572 , and Q9GZV3 in the rat fetus . These results indicate that repeated hypoxic episodes or/and a direct effect of nicotine on the central cholinergic system during pregnancy may contribute to brain developmental problems in fetal origin .
