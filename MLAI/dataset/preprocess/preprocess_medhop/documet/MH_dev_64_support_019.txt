Diarrhea associated with afatinib : an oral ErbB family blocker . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) adverse events ( AEs ) are frequently observed in patients receiving P01133 receptor ( P00533 ; also known as P00533 or ErbB1 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy . GI AEs are among the most common and most impactful on a patient 's quality of life . Severe diarrhea can result in fluid and electrolyte losses , leading to dehydration , electrolyte imbalances and renal insufficiency . DB08916 is an irreversible , oral , ErbB family blocker , inhibiting P00533 ( ErbB1 ) , P04626 ( ErbB2 ) and ErbB4 receptor kinases . It also inhibits transphosphorylation of ErbB3 . Similar to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors of P00533 , GI AEs - in particular , diarrhea - have frequently been observed in afatinib-treated patients . This article summarizes current data on afatinib-associated diarrhea and provides strategies for its management . Patient education , early identification , timely management and ongoing assessment will help to prevent aggravation , afatinib dose reductions or therapy discontinuation , encouraging patient compliance and allowing patients to obtain the maximum therapeutic benefit from this agent .
