Restoration of flow following haemodialysis catheter thrombus . Analysis of rt-PA infusion in tunnelled dialysis catheters . PROBLEM : DB00013 and streptokinase are commonly used thrombolytic agents for obstructed central venous catheters . Although proven to be efficacious , these agents have the potential to induce fibrin breakdown and streptokinase can not be used repeatedly because of its allergenic nature . Published evidence suggests that DB00013 is safe and effective ( > 70 % efficacy for catheter installation ) and that P00750 ( rt-PA ) can achieve as much as 98 % success . OBJECTIVE : To describe our experience with and our protocol for the use of rt-PA as an alternative agent for catheter thrombolysis . DESIGN : Investigation of a cohort of haemodialysis patients with tunnelled central venous catheter ( SPCVC ) placed between December 2001 to August 2003 and who developed catheter thrombus ( female , n = 8 : male , n = 12 ) . Each patient was given an infusion of between 1 and 2 mg rt-PA/h for 4 h . The dose was dependent on partial or total line obstruction . The technical success of rt-PA is defined as returning catheter blood flow to > 250 mL/min for a 4-h period . FINDINGS : Twenty patients required 57 infusions in 38 lumens between 01/01/02 to 01/09/03 . For completely blocked lines rt-PA was infused at 2 mg/h for 4 h achieving 85 % success rate . For inadequate flow ( < 250 mL/min ) rt-PA was infused at 1 mg/h for 4 h achieving an 88 % success rate . CONCLUSION : Rt-PA administered at 2 mg/h for blocked lines effectively restores haemodialysis catheter patency , and at 1 mg/h for sluggish lines is also effective in restoring blood flow through catheters .
