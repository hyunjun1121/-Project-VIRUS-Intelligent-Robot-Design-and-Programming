Serological HLA class I alleles in Senegalese blood donors detected HBs Ag positive . We analysed the HLA class I alleles in 96 blood donors HBs Ag positive compared with 93 healthy control individuals ( HBs negative ) . The most frequent HLA-A , -B , -C alleles found were , A23 ( 33.6 % ) ; A2 ( 25 % ) ; A30 ( 25 % ) ; B8 ( 31.5 % ) ; P33681 ( 16.3 % ) ; B58 ( 11.9 % ) ; B35 ( 11.9 % ) ; B49 ( 11.9 % ) ; B53 ( 10.8 % ) ; Cw7 ( Q04695 % ) ; Cw3 ( 36.9 % ) ; Cw4 ( 36.9 % ) . Significant differences ( P < 0.001 ) were found between the blood donors and the controls for the following HLA alleles , A1 ; A23 ; B8 and Cw3 . The detection of HBe antigen was positive in 26/84 blood donors . It was observed a significant difference ( P < 0.01 ; odds ratios (OR)=6.25 ) between positive and negative HBe antigens blood donors for HLA-A1 allele .
