Niacin reduces plasma P11597 levels by diminishing liver macrophage content in P11597 transgenic mice . The anti-dyslipidemic drug niacin has recently been shown to reduce the hepatic expression and plasma levels of P11597 . Since liver macrophages contribute to hepatic P11597 expression , we investigated the role of macrophages in the P11597 -lowering effect of niacin in mice . In vitro studies showed that niacin does not directly attenuate P11597 expression in macrophages . Treatment of normolipidemic human P11597 transgenic mice , fed a Western-type diet with niacin for 4 weeks , significantly reduced the hepatic cholesterol concentration ( -20 % ) , hepatic P11597 gene expression ( -20 % ) , and plasma P11597 mass ( -30 % ) . Concomitantly , niacin decreased the hepatic expression of P34810 ( -44 % ) and P45844 ( -32 % ) , both of which are specific markers for the hepatic macrophage content . The decrease in hepatic P11597 expression was significantly correlated with the reduction of hepatic macrophage markers . Furthermore , niacin attenuated atherogenic diet-induced inflammation in liver , as evident from decreased expression of P01375 ( -43 % ) . Niacin similarly decreased the macrophage markers and absolute macrophage content in hyperlipidemic P02649 *3-Leiden. P11597 transgenic mice on a Western-type diet . In conclusion , niacin decreases hepatic P11597 expression and plasma P11597 mass by attenuating liver inflammation and macrophage content in response to its primary lipid-lowering effect , rather than by attenuating the macrophage P11597 expression level .
