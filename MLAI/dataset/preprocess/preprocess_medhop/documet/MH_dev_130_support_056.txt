Fast and sharp decrease in calprotectin predicts remission by infliximab in anti- P01375 naïve patients with ulcerative colitis . AIM : To evaluate the effect of infliximab induction therapy on calprotectin levels in patients with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS : In this prospective study 53 patients with active UC from 17 centers were treated with infliximab therapy ( 5 mg/kg ) at baseline , week 2 , and week 6 . Faecal calprotectin was measured every week . Sigmoidoscopies were performed at baseline , week 6 and week 10 . RESULTS : Median calprotectin levels decreased from 1260 ( IQR 278.5- 3418 ) at baseline to 72.5 ( IQR 18.5 - 463 ) at week 10 ( p < 0.001 ) . After 10 weeks , infliximab therapy induced endoscopic remission and a decrease in calprotectin to < 50 mg/kg or at least a 80 % decrease from baseline level in 58 % of patients . A significant and steep decrease of calprotectin levels was seen at week 2 for patients with an endoscopic remission at week 10 as compared to patients who did not show a remission . ( p < 0.001 ) . At week 10 an excellent correlation was found between endoscopic remission and clinical Mayo score reflected by an AUC of ROC analyses of 0.94 ( 0.87-1 ) and with calprotectin measurements ( AUC 0.91 ( 0.81-1 ) ) : all patients with calprotectin levels < 50 mg/kg , and a normal clinical Mayo score ( =0 ) were in endoscopic remission . CONCLUSIONS : DB00065 induces a fast and significant decrease of faecal calprotectin levels in anti- P01375 naïve patients with ulcerative colitis predictive for remission of disease .
