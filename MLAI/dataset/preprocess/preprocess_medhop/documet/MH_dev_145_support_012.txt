The use of the VerifyNow Q9H244 point-of-care device to monitor platelet function across a range of Q9H244 inhibition levels following prasugrel and clopidogrel administration . Variability in response to antiplatelet agents has prompted the development of point-of-care ( POC ) technology . In this study , we compared the VerifyNow Q9H244 ( VN- Q9H244 ) POC device with light transmission aggregometry ( P01374 ) in subjects switched directly from clopidogrel to prasugrel . Healthy subjects on aspirin were administered a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose ( LD ) followed by a 75 mg/d maintenance dose ( MD ) for 10 days . Subjects were then switched to a prasugrel 60 mg LD and then 10 mg/d MD for 10 days ( n = 16 ) , or to a prasugrel 10 mg/d MD for 11 days ( n = 19 ) . Platelet function was measured by P01374 and VN- Q9H244 at baseline and after dosing . DB00758 600 mg LD/75 mg MD treatment led to a reduction in P2Y(12) reaction units ( PRU ) from baseline . A switch from clopidogrel MD to prasugrel 60 mg LD/10 mg MD produced an immediate decrease in PRU , while a switch to prasugrel 10 mg MD resulted in a more gradual decline . Consistent with the reduction in PRU , device-reported percent inhibition increased during both clopidogrel and prasugrel regimens . Inhibition of platelet aggregation as measured by P01374 showed a very similar pattern to that found with VN- Q9H244 measurement , irrespective of treatment regimens . The dynamic range of VN- Q9H244 appeared to be narrower than that of P01374 . With two different thienopyridines , the VN- Q9H244 device , within a somewhat more limited range , reflected the overall magnitude of change in aggregation response determined by P01374 . The determination of the clinical utility of such POC devices will require their use in clinical outcome studies .
