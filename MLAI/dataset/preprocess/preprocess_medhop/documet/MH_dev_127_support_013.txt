DB00819 inhibits aquaporin-1 expression and colon cancer xenograft tumor growth . BACKGROUND/AIMS : To study the effects of water channel protein inhibitor acetazolamide on xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer in nude mice . METHODOLOGY : Setting up human colon cancer model in nude mice , mice were randomly divided into two groups as experimental group and control group . DB00819 was given at a volume of 0.1mL per mice ( 40mg/kg/d , ig ) in experimental group , while the same volume of sterile saline was given in control group ( ig ) . After 21 days , protein and m-RNA levels of P29972 in tumor tissues from two groups were detected respectively by Western blot and RT-PCR to evaluate the treatment effects . P29972 , P15692 and P28906 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry , simultaneously . RESULTS : DB00819 ( 40mg/kg/d , ig ) significantly inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer in nude mice . The inhibition rate was 88.28 % . In comparison with the control group , P29972 protein and mRNA level were significantly reduced in the experimental group ( p < 0.01 ) . P29972 , P15692 and P28906 expression in experimental group were positively correlated between each other ( p < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB00819 can suppress the xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting the expression of P29972 .
