Changes in Dermatomal Somatosensory Evoked Potentials according to Stimulation Intensity and Severity of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the change of latency of cervical dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential ( P81605 ) according to stimulation intensity ( SI ) and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . METHODS : Stimulation sites were the P13671 , P10643 , and Q99618 dermatomal areas . Two stimulation intensities 1.5×sensory threshold ( ST ) and 2.5×ST were used on both normal and CTS patients . RESULTS : In moderate CTS , the latencies of P13671 and P10643 P81605 during 1.5×ST SI and those of P10643 P81605 during 2.5×ST SI were significantly delayed compared with the values of normal subjects . Significant correlation between the latency of P10643 P81605 of 2.5×ST stimulation and the median sensory nerve conduction velocity was observed . CONCLUSION : We suggest that these data can aid in the diagnosis of cervical sensory radiculopathy using low stimulation intensity and of those who have cervical sensory radiculopathy combined with CTS patients .
