Synergistic growth inhibition in HL-60 cells by the combination of acyclic retinoid and vitamin K2 . PURPOSE : The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acyclic retinoid ( P10323 ) and vitamin K(2) ( VK(2) ) in HL-60 cells . METHODS : We used HL-60 cells , and the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method was used for cell proliferation assays . For detection of apoptosis , the P08758 -binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry . To evaluate the cell cycle , we used a FITC BrdU Flow P10721 and flow cytometry . Total extracted and equivalent amounts of protein were examined by Western blotting using specific antibodies . RESULTS : P10323 and VK(2) dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells . These two agents in combination synergistically inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis . VK(2) inhibited activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway , and P10323 plus VK(2) cooperatively inhibited phosphorylation of RXRÎ± and the growth of HL-60 cells . Moreover , P10323 and VK(2) induced increases in G0/ P55008 phase HL-60 cells , alone and synergistically in combination . CONCLUSION : The synergistic effects of P10323 and VK(2) on HL-60 cells may provide a novel strategy for treating leukemia .
