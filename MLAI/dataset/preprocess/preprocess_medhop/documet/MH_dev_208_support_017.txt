Treatment with DB06603 induces glucose-regulated protein 78 acetylation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in breast cancer cells . Increased levels of misfolded polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) triggers the dissociation of glucose-regulated protein 78 ( P11021 ) from the three transmembrane ER-stress mediators , i.e. , protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase ( Q9NZJ5 ) , activating transcription factor-6 ( P18850 ) , and inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha , which results in the adaptive unfolded protein response ( UPR ) . In the present studies , we determined that histone deacetylase-6 ( Q9UBN7 ) binds and deacetylates P11021 . Following treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor DB06603 ( Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) , or knockdown of Q9UBN7 by short hairpin RNA , P11021 is acetylated in 11 lysine residues , which dissociates P11021 from Q9NZJ5 . This is associated with the activation of a lethal UPR in human breast cancer cells . Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that binding of Q9UBN7 to P11021 requires the second catalytic and COOH-terminal BUZ domains of Q9UBN7 . Treatment with DB06603 increased the levels of phosphorylated-eukaryotic translation initiation factor ( p-eIF2alpha ) , P18848 , and CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein ( P35638 ) . DB06603 treatment also increased the proapoptotic Q13323 , O43521 , Q07812 , and Q16611 levels , as well as increased the activity of caspase-7 . Knockdown of P11021 sensitized MCF-7 cells to bortezomib and DB06603 -induced UPR and cell death . These findings indicate that enforced acetylation and decreased binding of P11021 to Q9NZJ5 is mechanistically linked to DB06603 -induced UPR and cell death of breast cancer cells .
