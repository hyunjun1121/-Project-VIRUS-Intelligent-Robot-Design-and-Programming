Potential antipsychotic properties of central cannabinoid ( P21554 ) receptor antagonists . Delta(9)- DB00470 ( Delta(9)-THC ) , the principal psychoactive constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant , and other agonists at the central cannabinoid ( CB(1) ) receptor may induce characteristic psychomotor effects , psychotic reactions and cognitive impairment resembling schizophrenia . These effects of Delta(9)-THC can be reduced in animal and human models of psychopathology by two exogenous cannabinoids , cannabidiol ( DB09061 ) and SR141716 . DB09061 is the second most abundant constituent of Cannabis sativa that has weak partial antagonistic properties at the CB(1) receptor . DB09061 inhibits the reuptake and hydrolysis of anandamide , the most important endogenous CB(1) receptor agonist , and exhibits neuroprotective antioxidant activity . SR141716 is a potent and selective CB(1) receptor antagonist . Since both DB09061 and SR141716 can reverse many of the biochemical , physiological and behavioural effects of CB(1) receptor agonists , it has been proposed that both DB09061 and SR141716 have antipsychotic properties . Various experimental studies in animals , healthy human volunteers , and schizophrenic patients support this notion . Moreover , recent studies suggest that cannabinoids such as DB09061 and SR141716 have a pharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotic drugs . In this review , both preclinical and clinical studies investigating the potential antipsychotic effects of both DB09061 and SR141716 are presented together with the possible underlying mechanisms of action .
