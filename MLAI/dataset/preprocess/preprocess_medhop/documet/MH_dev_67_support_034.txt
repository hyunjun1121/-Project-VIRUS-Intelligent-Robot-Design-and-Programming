Oleocanthal inhibits proliferation and MIP-1α expression in human multiple myeloma cells . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a plasma cell malignancy that causes devastating bone destruction by activating osteoclasts in the bone marrow milieu . MM is the second of all hematological malignancies . Thus , the search for new pharmacological weapons is under intensive investigation being MM a critically important public health goal . Recently , it has been demonstrated that macrophage inflammatory protein 1- alpha ( MIP-1 α ) is crucially involved in the development of osteolytic bone lesions in MM . Phenolic components of extra virgin olive oil are reported to have anti tumor activity . However , the underlying mechanisms and specific targets of extra virgin olive oil remain to be elucidated . In the present study , we investigated the effects of a recently isolated novel extra virgin olive oil polyphenol , oleocanthal , on the human multiple myeloma cell line Q5SW96 -77 . Here we report that this natural compound has a remarkable in vitro activity by inhibiting MIP-1 α expression and secretion in MM cells . In addition , we also demonstrated that oleocanthal inhibits MM cells proliferation by inducing the activation of apoptosis mechanisms and by down-regulating P27361 /2 and AKT signal transduction pathways . This in vitro study suggests a therapeutic potential of oleocanthal in treating multiple myeloma .
