Role of Q14116 in overt pain-like behaviour in mice . There are evidences that targeting Q14116 might be beneficial to inhibit inflammatory symptoms , including hypernociception ( decrease in nociceptive threshold ) . The mechanism of Q14116 mechanical hypernociception depends on endothelin in rats and mice . However , the role of Q14116 in overt pain-like behaviour remains undetermined . Therefore , we addressed the role of Q14116 in writhing response induced by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of phenyl-p-benzoquinone ( PBQ ) and acetic acid in mice . Firstly , it was detected that PBQ and acetic acid i.p. injection induced a dose-dependent number of writhes in Balb/c mice . Subsequently , it was observed that the PBQ - but not the acetic acid-induced writhes were diminished in Q14116 deficient ( ( -/- ) ) mice . Therefore , considering that P01579 , endothelin and prostanoids mediate Q14116 -induced mechanical hypernociception , we also investigated the role of these mediators in the same model of writhing response in which Q14116 participates . It was noticed that PBQ-induced writhes were diminished in P01579 (-/-) mice and by the treatment with DB00559 ( mixed endothelin P25101 /ETB receptor antagonist ) , BQ 123 ( cyclo[DTrp-DAsp-Pro-DVal- DB00149 ] , selective endothelin P25101 receptor antagonist ) , BQ 788 ( N-cys-2,6 dimethylpiperidinocarbonyl-l-methylleucyl-d-1-methoxycarboyl-d-norleucine , selective endothelin ETB receptor antagonist ) or indomethacin ( cycloxigenase inhibitor ) . Thus , Q14116 , P01579 , endothelin acting on endothelin P25101 and ETB receptors , and prostanoids mediate PBQ-induced writhing response in mice . To conclude , these results further advance the understanding of the physiopathology of overt pain-like behaviour , and suggest for the first time a role for Q14116 in writhing response in mice .
