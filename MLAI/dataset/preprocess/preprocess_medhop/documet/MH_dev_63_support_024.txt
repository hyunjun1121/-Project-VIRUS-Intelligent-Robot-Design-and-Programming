Interrelationships in mice of antipyrine half-life , hepatic monooxygenase activities and liver S9-mediated mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 , benzo[alpha]pyrene 7,8-dihydrodiol , 2-acetylaminofluorene and N-nitrosomorpholine . To evaluate the predictive value of serum antipyrine half-life AP(T1/2) as an index of hepatic carcinogen metabolism , groups of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice were treated with various inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases ( pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile ( Q15149 ) , phenobarbital ( PB ) , DB06732 ( 5,6-BF ) , 3-methylcholanthrene ( MC ) , disulfiram ( Q8IX12 ) , 7,8-BF ) . Groups of mice were also given ethanol ( 3 % in drinking water ) for 12 days . Within each group , mean serum AP-(T1/2) was compared with ( i ) the in vitro activity of hepatic microsomal benzo[alpha]pyrene ( BP ) 3-hydroxylase , 2-acetylaminofluorene ( AAF ) -N-hydroxylase and aldrin monooxygenase , and ( ii ) the liver S9-mediated mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 ( AFB ) , trans-7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo[alpha]pyrene ( BP 7,8-diol ) , 2-acetylaminofluorene and N-nitrosomorpholine ( NMOR ) in Salmonella typhimurium strains . Serum AP(T1/2) was only correlated negatively with the activity of BP 3-hydroxylase ( P less than 0.001 ) and aldrin monooxygenase ( P less than 0.001 ) . No statistically significant correlation was found between serum AP(T1/2) and liver S9-mediated mutagenicity for any of the four carcinogens . On the basis of these results , we conclude that serum AP(T1/2) may not be a reliable index of the capacity of liver to convert carcinogens into reactive intermediates .
