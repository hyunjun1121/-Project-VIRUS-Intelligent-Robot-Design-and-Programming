Mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in paediatric patients , prior to autologous transplantation following administration of plerixafor and DB00099 . Previous chemotherapy and radiation exposure can make adequate stem cell mobilisation prior to autologous transplant extremely difficult in paediatrics . DB06809 , a selective reversible P61073 antagonist interferes with P61073 interaction with P48061 alpha ( P48061 ) . Combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) amplifies G- P04141 affects in mobilising haematopoietic stem cells . Whilst licensed for use with G- P04141 for enhancement of mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in adults , paediatric data for use of plerixafor remain limited . We present a retrospective review of outcomes seen with plerixafor and G- P04141 to mobilise stem cells heavily pre-treated paediatric patients with cancer .
