Q96RP3 is expressed in human pregnant myometrial cells and regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation : potential role of the type-2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the control of myometrial contractility . The family of P06850 -related peptides are suggested to play important roles in the control of myometrial contractility during pregnancy and labor . In this study we investigated the expression of urocortin II ( P55089 II ) in human myometrium and its ability to phosphorylate intracellular components that can be involved in modulating myometrial contractility . Using RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization , we demonstrated that P55089 II and type-2 P06850 receptor ( Q13324 ) mRNAs were expressed in human nonpregnant and pregnant myometrium . Immunofluorescent studies confirmed protein expression of P55089 II in human pregnant myometrial cells , whereas chemical cross-linking studies with radiolabeled P55089 II confirmed the presence of Q13324 sites with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa . Treatment of primary human myometrial cells with P55089 II to specifically activate Q13324 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of myosin light chain ( MLC(20) ) phosphorylation . Activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and P27361 /2 was required for the P55089 II-induced activation of MLC(20) , because treatment of myometrial cells with inhibitors of MAPK kinase 1 ( U0126 ) and PKC ( bisindolylmaleimide ) inhibited the P55089 II-induced phosphorylation of MLC(20) . Furthermore , the P55089 II effect on MLC(20) was dependent on RhoA translocation to the membrane and subsequent activation of RhoA-associated kinase , as shown by the use of the specific inhibitors exoenzyme P01024 and Y27632 . Collectively , our data suggest a distinctive role for Q13324 - specific agonists like P55089 II in the control of myometrial contractility during human pregnancy involving sequential activation of PKC , MAPK kinase 1 , P27361 /2 , RhoA , and RhoA-associated kinase , leading to the MLC(20) phosphorylation .
