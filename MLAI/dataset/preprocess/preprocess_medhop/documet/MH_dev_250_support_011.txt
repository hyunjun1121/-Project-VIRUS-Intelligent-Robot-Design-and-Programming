DB01590 ( RAD001 ) : an P42345 inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma . The recent introduction of drugs that inhibit angiogenesis or the P42345 has provided new options for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma , a disease which often has a poor prognosis . Chemotherapy and cytokine therapy are largely ineffective . The 5-year survival rate is under 10 % . DB01590 , an immunosuppressive drug widely used for the prevention of allograft rejection and an P42345 inhibitor , is one of the latest drugs undergoing clinical trials in metastatic renal cell carcinoma . It has been tested in patients with progressive disease after therapy with tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors ( sunitinib , sorafenib or both ) , which interfere with signaling pathways , such as the P15692 pathway . Clinical efficacy results ( progression-free survival ) for everolimus are promising and the safety profile is good .
