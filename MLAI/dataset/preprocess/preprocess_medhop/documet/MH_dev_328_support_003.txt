Bioassay-guided isolation of an alkaloid with antiangiogenic and antitumor activities from the extract of Fissistigma cavaleriei root . Fissistigma cavaleriei ( Levl ) Rehd ( Annonaceae ) is used as a folklore medicine for treatment of inflammation , arthritis , and tuberculosis by Miao people in China . In the present study , the antiangiogenic activity of F. cavaleriei was investigated . The chorioallantoic membrane of the fertilized hen 's egg ( P62158 assay ) was used to determine antiangiogenic activity of the plant extract . Compound ( 1 ) , a compound with antiangiogenic activity , was isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation from F. cavaleriei for the first time . The structure of compound ( 1 ) was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods . Colorimetric P36551 ( ovine ) inhibitor screening assay was used to determine its inhibitory effect on P23219 and P35354 . MTT and Sulforhodamine B assays were used to investigate its cytotoxic effects on tumor cell lines . As a result , compound ( 1 ) showed a selectively inhibiting effect on P35354 and could inhibit the growth of tumor cells in vitro . The antitumor activity of compound ( 1 ) was further confirmed by the observation that compound ( 1 ) administration significantly inhibited the growth of S-180 cells in mice . Moreover , compound ( 1 ) was able to enhance the antitumor activity of doxorubicin in the mice bearing with S-180 cells while combined with doxorubicin . In conclusion , compound ( 1 ) is a multi-target molecule and further experimental investigations are needed to determine whether it can be used as a lead molecule for tumor treatment .
