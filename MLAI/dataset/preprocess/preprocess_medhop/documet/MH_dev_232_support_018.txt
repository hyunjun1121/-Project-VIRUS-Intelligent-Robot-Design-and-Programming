Inhibition of prothrombin kringle-2-induced inflammation by minocycline protects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in vivo . P00734 kringle-2 ( pKr-2 ) , a domain of prothrombin , can cause the degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons through microglial activation . However , the chemical products that inhibit pKr-2-induced inflammatory activities in the brain are still not well known . The present study investigated whether minocycline , a semisynthetic tetracycline derivative , could inhibit pKr-2-induced microglial activation and prevent the loss of nigral dopaminergic ( DA ) neurons in vivo . To address this question , rats were administered a unilateral injection of pKr-2 in the substantia nigra in the presence or absence of minocycline . Our results show that pKr-2 induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) and interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase from the activated microglia . In parallel , 7 days after pKr-2 injection , tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemical analysis and western blot analysis showed a significant loss of nigral DA neurons . This neurotoxicity was antagonized by minocycline and the observed neuroprotective effects were associated with the ability of minocycline to suppress the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-1β , and nitric oxide synthase . These results suggest that minocycline may be promising as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of DA neuronal degeneration associated with pKr-2-induced microglial activation .
