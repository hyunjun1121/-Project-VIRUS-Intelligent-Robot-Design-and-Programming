Protective effects of metallothionein on isoniazid and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity in mice . Isoniazid ( DB00951 ) and DB01045 ( RFP ) are widely used in the world for the treatment of tuberculosis , but the hepatotoxicity is a major concern during clinical therapy . Previous studies showed that these drugs induced oxidative stress in liver , and several antioxidants abated this effect . Metallothionein ( MT ) , a member of cysteine-rich protein , has been proposed as a potent antioxidant . This study attempts to determine whether endogenous expression of MT protects against DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic oxidative stress in mice . Wild type ( MT+/+ ) and MT-null ( MT-/- ) mice were treated intragastrically with DB00951 ( 150 mg/kg ) , RFP ( 300 mg/kg ) , or the combination ( 150 mg/kg DB00951 +300 mg/kg RFP ) for 21 days . The results showed that MT-/- mice were more sensitive than MT+/+ mice to DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatic injuries as evidenced by hepatic histopathological alterations , increased serum Q9NRA2 levels and liver index , and hepatic oxidative stress as evidenced by the increase of MDA production and the change of liver antioxidant status . Furthermore , DB00951 increased the protein expression of hepatic P05181 and DB00951 /RFP ( alone or in combination ) decreased the expression of hepatic P05177 . These findings clearly demonstrate that basal MT provides protection against DB00951 and RFP-induced toxicity in hepatocytes . The P05181 and P05177 were involved in the pathogenesis of DB00951 and RFP-induced hepatotoxicity .
