Genetic determinants of diabetes are similarly associated with other immune-mediated diseases . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : I discuss the increasing number of genes discovered to exert pleiotropic action on susceptibility to diabetes and simultaneously to other immune-mediated diseases . While a genetic correlation between type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity is not surprising , the mechanism of a relationship to other conditions such as atopy is less obvious . The recent wave of genome-wide association studies offers confirmation of previously recognized risk loci , but also novel loci that also are likely to act via multiple pathogenetic pathways . I will review this material more in a genetical than an immunological way . RECENT FINDINGS : Identification of Q9BYX4 , an RNA helicase involved in the innate immune response to viral infection as a risk factor for type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis . Confirmation of the roles of P16410 and Q9Y2R2 as general immune function modulators with a nonlinear dose-response effect on autoimmunity , and confirmation of the role of P01589 , which may act via a regulatory T cell subset on immune disease risk . Expansion of the role of P37231 in immunity . SUMMARY : The wave of genome-wide association studies already experienced in the last 2 years has solidified what we thought we knew and added a list of genes in new pathways . The association of Q9BYX4 with type 1 diabetes may offer a real window into early events in the development of that disease .
