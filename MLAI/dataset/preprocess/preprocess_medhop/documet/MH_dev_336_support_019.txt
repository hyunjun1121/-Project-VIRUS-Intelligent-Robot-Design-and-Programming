Δ(9)- DB00470 treatment during human monocyte differentiation reduces macrophage susceptibility to HIV-1 infection . The major psychoactive component of marijuana , Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , also acts to suppress inflammatory responses . Receptors for THC , P21554 , CB2 , and Q9Y2T6 , are differentially expressed on multiple cell types including monocytes and macrophages , which are important modulators of inflammation in vivo and target cells for HIV-1 infection . Use of recreational and medicinal marijuana is increasing , but the consequences of marijuana exposure on HIV-1 infection are unclear . Ex vivo studies were designed to investigate effects on HIV-1 infection in macrophages exposed to THC during or following differentiation . THC treatment of primary human monocytes during differentiation reduced HIV-1 infection of subsequent macrophages by replication competent or single cycle P51681 using viruses . In contrast , treatment of macrophages with THC immediately prior to or continuously following HIV-1 exposure failed to alter infection . Specific receptor agonists indicated that the THC effect during monocyte differentiation was mediated primarily through CB2 . THC reduced the number of p24 positive cells with little to no effect on virus production per infected cell , while quantitation of intracellular viral gag pinpointed the THC effect to an early event in the viral life cycle . Cells treated during differentiation with THC displayed reduced expression of P08571 , CD16 , and Q86VB7 and donor dependent increases in mRNA expression of selected viral restriction factors , suggesting a fundamental alteration in phenotype . Ultimately , the mechanism of THC suppression of HIV-1 infection was traced to a reduction in cell surface HIV receptor ( P01730 , P51681 and P61073 ) expression that diminished entry efficiency .
