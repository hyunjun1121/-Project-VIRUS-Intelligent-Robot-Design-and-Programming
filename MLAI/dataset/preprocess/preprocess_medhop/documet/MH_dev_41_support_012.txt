Inflammatory protein serum amyloid A1 marks a subset of conventional renal cell carcinomas with fatal outcome . BACKGROUND : Conventional renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) is the most common renal cancer . As the metastatic conventional RCC is practically incurable , there is a need for markers to estimate the tumour aggressiveness . OBJECTIVE : To identify and characterise new marker(s) associated with the poor prognosis of conventional RCC . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : RNA from 24 conventional RCCs was analysed for global gene expression by Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays . Tissue microarrays containing 224 renal tumours including 87 conventional RCCs were used for immunohistochemistry . Cell lines Q92769 , HD48 , HA344 and HA465 established in our laboratory were used for invasion assay and zymography . MEASUREMENTS : Serum amyloid A 1 ( P0DJI8 ) was found to be upregulated in conventional RCCs and it has been analysed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on TMAs to establish the correlation between P0DJI8 protein expression and patient survival by uni and multivariate analysis . The effect of P0DJI8 on tumour cell behaviour in vitro has also been examined by invasion assay and zymography . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS : P0DJI8 RNA is expressed in conventional RCC samples of patients with poor prognosis . Immunohistochemistry of 72 conventional RCCs with a 5 yr follow up showed a correlation between P0DJI8 expression and the clinical outcome of disease . Stimulation of conventional RCC cell lines with recombinant P0DJI8 increased the expression of metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 and the invasive potential of tumour cells . Limitation of the study is a relatively small number ( 72 ) of patients having follow up . CONCLUSION : P0DJI8 seems to be a useful marker to estimate the prognosis of conventional RCCs .
