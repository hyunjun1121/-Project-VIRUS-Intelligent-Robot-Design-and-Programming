P00533 expression and suramin cytotoxicity in vitro . Twenty-five cell lines derived from nine different human cancers were tested for the cytotoxic activity of suramin . Two different initial cellular concentrations were used : C1 ( 800-2000 cells per well ) and P06681 ( 3000-7000 cells per well ) . Suramin concentrations ranged from 50 to 2500 micrograms/ml . Cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT test . Epidermal growth factor receptors ( P00533 ) were assayed by competition analysis and Scatchard plots . In sixteen cell lines suramin had an unexpected growth stimulation effect at low concentration ( 50-125 micrograms/ml ) . IC50 varied from 21 micrograms/ml ( osteosarcoma , OS2 ) to 1408 micrograms/ml ( melanoma , Q9HD26 24 ) and , within melanoma cell lines , it varied from 120 micrograms/ml ( Q9HD26 41 ) to 1408 micrograms/ml ( Q9HD26 24 ) . The individual IC50 values were positively and significantly linked with the initial cellular density . Eighteen cell lines had measurable P00533 ( six with two families of sites , twelve with one ) : Kd varied between 0.004 nmol/l for the highest affinity site ( melanoma , Q9HD26 7 ) to 1.852 nmol/l for the lowest affinity site ( lung , Q9HD26 12 ) . There was no relation between presence or absence of P01133 binding sites and distribution of IC50 , but for cells with measurable P00533 there was a weak but significant correlation between the number of P01133 binding sites per cell and the corresponding IC50 ( r = -0.53 , P = 0.021 ) .
