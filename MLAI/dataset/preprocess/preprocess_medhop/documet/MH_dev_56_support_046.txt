Pharmacologic therapies in endometriosis : a systematic review . To assess the literature on preclinical and clinical efficacy and safety data of pharmacologic groups proposed in the treatment of endometriosis , we performed a systematic review of publications from March 2002 to January 2012 via PubMed search . Additional relevant articles were identified from citations within these publications . A high number of medications were tested in preclinical models of endometriosis due to their theoretic capacity of disrupting important pathophysiologic pathways of the disease , such as inflammatory response , angiogenesis and cell survival , proliferation , migration , adhesion , and invasion . P01375 α-blockers , nuclear factor κB inhibitors , antiangiogenic agents , statins , antioxidants , immunomodulators , flavonoids , histone deacetylase inhibitors , matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors , metformin , novel modulators of sex steroids expression , and apoptotic agents were all effective in in vitro/animal models . Most of these agents have not been tried in the clinical setting , mainly because of the high risk of adverse effects . However , some of them can be used in humans . Dopamine agonists and valproic acid have already been tested in pilot studies with good results . DB00005 , metformin , and statins are used in humans for other indications , and endostatin is now being tested in phase 2 oncologic trials . These drugs may constitute alternatives to conventional therapy with estrogen inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents .
