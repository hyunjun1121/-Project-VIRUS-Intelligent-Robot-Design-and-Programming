Comparative studies of a humanized anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody , YM337 , and abciximab on in vitro antiplatelet effect and binding properties . The effects of YM337 , the Fab fragment of a humanized anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ( P08514 /IIIa ) monoclonal antibody C4G1 , on in vitro platelet function and binding properties were compared with those of abciximab , the Fab fragment of the human/murine chimeric anti- P08514 /IIIa monoclonal antibody DB00054 . Both agents completely inhibited platelet aggregation caused by all agonists tested except ristocetin . Further , both inhibited human platelet adhesion to P04275 , fibrinogen , fibronectin and subendothelial matrix with similar potency . DB09222 binding to washed platelets was dose-dependently inhibited by both agents . In binding assay using 125I-YM337 and 125I-abciximab , Kd values determined with platelet-rich plasma were 6.74 +/- 0.56 nM for YM337 and 6.65 +/- 1.45 nM for abciximab , and the number of binding sites were 42,700 +/- 3,000 for YM337 and 76,000 +/- 5,400 for abciximab . P08514 /IIIa was precipitated from the solubilized fraction of platelets by both agents . In contrast , integrin alphavbeta3 was precipitated from the solubilized fraction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by abciximab but not by YM337 . DB09222 binding to purified P08514 /IIIa was dose-dependently inhibited by both agents . In contrast , vitronectin binding to purified integrin alphavbeta3 was dose-dependently inhibited by abciximab but not by YM337 , supporting the idea that abciximab reacts to integrin alphavbeta3 . Therefore , YM337 was suggested to bind to a different epitope of P08514 /IIIa from abciximab . These results suggest that YM337 specifically acts on platelet P08514 /IIIa receptors and has similar inhibitory properties on platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion to abciximab .
