Effect of interferon-gamma and P01375 on P15941 mucin expression in ovarian carcinoma cell lines . In view of the potential uses of cell surface tumour associated antigens in novel anticancer treatment , a study was designed to investigate whether the biological response modifiers interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) could effect the expression of an epitope on the tumour associated P15941 epithelial mucin . Four ovarian carcinoma cell lines showing high ( OAW42 and GG ) and low ( JAM and PE01 ) basal expression of P15941 were treated with 10-1000 U/mL of P01579 or P01375 for one or five days . Changes in P15941 expression in cells exposed to P01579 or P01375 were monitored using an ELISA technique with the monoclonal antibody O43633 which reacts with a core protein epitope on the P15941 mucin , and then corrected for the number of viable cells present . P01375 had little effect on P15941 expression , but one or five days exposure to P01579 significantly increased P15941 expression ( p < 0.01 ) in all cell lines including the two cell lines that initially showed little or no expression .
