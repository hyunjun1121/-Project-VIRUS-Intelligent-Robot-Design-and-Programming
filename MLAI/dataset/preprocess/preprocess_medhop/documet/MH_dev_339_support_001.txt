Impact of smoking on dendritic cell phenotypes in the airway lumen of patients with P48444 . BACKGROUND : Myeloid dendritic cells ( DCs ) are increased in the airway wall of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , and postulated to play a crucial role in P48444 . However , DC phenotypes in P48444 are poorly understood . METHODS : Function-associated surface molecules on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) DCs were analyzed using flow cytometry in current smokers with P48444 , in former smokers with P48444 and in never-smoking controls . RESULTS : Myeloid DCs of current smokers with P48444 displayed a significantly increased expression of receptors for antigen recognition such as BDCA-1 or Q9UJ71 , as compared with never-smoking controls . In contrast , former smokers with P48444 displayed a significantly decreased expression of these receptors , as compared with never-smoking controls . A significantly reduced expression of the maturation marker Q01151 on myeloid DCs was found in current smokers with P48444 , but not in former smokers with P48444 . The chemokine receptor P51681 on myeloid DCs , which is also important for the uptake and procession of microbial antigens , was strongly reduced in all patients with P48444 , independently of the smoking status . CONCLUSION : P48444 is characterized by a strongly reduced P51681 expression on myeloid DCs in the airway lumen , which might hamper DC interactions with microbial antigens . Further studies are needed to better understand the role of P51681 in the pathophysiology and microbiology of P48444 .
