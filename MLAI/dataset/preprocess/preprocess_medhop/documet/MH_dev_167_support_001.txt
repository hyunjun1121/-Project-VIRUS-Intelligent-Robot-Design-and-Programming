Aging and age-related diseases -- from endocrine therapy to target therapy . Aging represents an important health issue not only for the individual , but also for society in general . Burdens associated with aging are expanding as longevity increases . This has led to an enhanced focus on issues related to aging and age-related diseases . Until recently , anti-aging endocrine-therapy has been largely limited to hormone-replacement therapy ( HRT ) that is associated with multiple side effects , including an increased risk of cancer . This has greatly limited the application of HRT in anti-aging therapy . Recently , the focus of anti-aging research has expanded from endocrine signaling pathways to effects on regulatory gene networks . In this regard , the P01286 -GH- DB01277 / P01308 , TOR- P23443 ,NAD(+)-Sirtuin , P04637 , Q9UEF7 and P02649 pathways have been linked to processes associated with age-related diseases , including cancer , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , osteoporosis , and neurodegenerative diseases , all of which directly influence health in aging , and represent key targets in anti-aging therapy .
