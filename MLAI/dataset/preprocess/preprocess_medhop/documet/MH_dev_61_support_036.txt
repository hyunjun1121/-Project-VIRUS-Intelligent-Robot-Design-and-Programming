P10275 coregulator Q96L73 -alpha interacts with death receptor-6 revealed by the yeast two-hybrid . Q96L73 -alpha is a newly identified androgen receptor coactivator . In order to further elucidate its precise role in cells , using the Q96L73 -alpha fragment containing four P20941 and one Q01105 conserved domains as bait we revealed an Q96L73 -alpha- P20941 - Q01105 -interacting protein , death receptor-6 ( O75509 ) , in the yeast two-hybrid screening . O75509 is the member of P01375 receptor family and has a death domain in its intracellular cytoplasmic portion ( DR6cp ) to mediate the cell apoptosis . The interaction between Q96L73 -alpha- P20941 - Q01105 and DR6cp was confirmed in vitro and in vivo . Our finding implied that androgen signaling pathway might cross talk with apoptosis signaling pathway through the interaction between Q96L73 -alpha and O75509 .
