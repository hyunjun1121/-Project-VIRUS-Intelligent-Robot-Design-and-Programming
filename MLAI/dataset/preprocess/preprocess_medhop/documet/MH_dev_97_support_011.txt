The somatotropic axis in neonatal calves can be modulated by nutrition , growth hormone , and Long-R3- P05019 . Effects on the somatotropic axis [ plasma levels of insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs ) I and II , IGF-binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) , and growth hormone ( GH ) ] of feeding different amounts of colostrum or milk replacer , of Long-R3- P05019 ( administered subcutaneously or orally ; 50 micrograms.kg body wt-1.day-1 for 7 days ) , and of subcutaneously injected recombinant bovine GH ( rbGH ; 1 mg.kg body wt-1.day-1 for 7 days ) were evaluated in calves during the 1st wk of life . Plasma Long-R3- P05019 increased after subcutaneous application but not with the oral dose . Endogenous P05019 was higher in calves fed colostrum six times compared with those fed only milk replacer . Native P05019 was highest in rbGH-injected calves but was lowered by the subcutaneous injection of Long-R3- P05019 . P01344 concentrations were not modified by any of the treatments . P18065 increased in calves fed only milk replacer and those receiving subcutaneous Long-R3- P05019 . GH was not modulated by differences in nutrition but increased after rbGH administration and similarly in all groups after intravenous injection of GH-releasing factor analog P01286 -(1-29) . Parenteral administration of Long-R3- P05019 decreased GH concentration but did not affect the secretory pattern . The data demonstrate that the somatotrophic axis is basically functioning in neonatal calves and is influenced by nutrition , GH , and Long-R3- P05019 .
