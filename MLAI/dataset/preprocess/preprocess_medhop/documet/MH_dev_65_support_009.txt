Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is activated by dysregulated cyclin E during mammary epithelial morphogenesis . Increased cyclin E expression has been identified in human tumors of diverse histologies , and in studies of primary breast cancers , high cyclin E is associated with poor prognosis . We have studied dysregulated cyclin E in epithelial tissues using organotypic cultures of human mammary epithelial cells and a murine model . We unexpectedly discovered that dysregulated cyclin E impairs normal acinar morphogenesis in vitro , and this is associated with the induction of P38936 (Cip1) , p27(Kip1) , and cellular senescence . P12004 E-induced morphogenesis arrest is dependent upon hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ( HIF-1α ) , which itself is induced by high cyclin E both in cultured mammary acini and in mammary epithelial tissues in a mouse model of deregulated cyclin E expression . We next determined that E2F activity directly regulates and is required for induction of Q16665 by cyclin E. Additionally , we found that cyclin E deregulation in mammary acini decreases , in an E2F-independent manner , expression of the Q9GZT9 prolyl hydroxylase that regulates HIF-1α degradation within the P40337 ubiquitin ligase pathway . Together , our findings reveal a direct link between cyclin E and Q9BYW2 activities in mammary epithelial cells and implicate Q9BYW2 as a mediator of proliferation-independent phenotypes associated with high cyclin E expression in some human breast cancers .
