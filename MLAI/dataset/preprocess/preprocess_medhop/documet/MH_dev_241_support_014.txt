Differential gene signatures in rat mammary tumors induced by DMBA and those induced by fractionated gamma radiation . The aim of this work was to identify specific genes involved in rat mammary tumors induced by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ( DMBA ) or radiation . More TUNEL- and P12004 -positive cells were present in mammary tumors induced by radiation than in tumors induced by DMBA , whereas DNA damage responses like p53 accumulation and histone P16104 phosphorylation were higher in DMBA-induced tumors , even though the pathology was similar in both types of tumors . cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis of radiation- or DMBA-induced tumor tissues , revealed that stanniocalcin 2 ( Stc2 ) , interferon regulatory factor 1 ( Irf1 ) , interleukin 18 binding protein ( Il18bp ) , and chloride channel calcium activated 3 ( Clca3 ) were expressed in both , and that arachidonate P09917 activating protein 1 ( Alox5ap ) and cathepsin S ( Ctss ) were expressed only in radiation-induced tumors . No DMBA-specific gene signatures were found . Soft agar growth assays were carried out to identify the carcinogenic features of these specific genes . Cells stably transfected with Alox5ap , Ctss , Stc2 , Irf1 , Il18bp and Clca3 showed morphological changes compared to controls . These findings indicate different gene alterations in carcinogen- or radiation-induced mammary tumors with similar pathological stages .
