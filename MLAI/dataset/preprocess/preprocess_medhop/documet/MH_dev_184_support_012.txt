Expression and regulation of prostaglandin E synthase isoforms in human myometrium with labour . Since the controversies regarding the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and selective cyclo-oxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 antagonists for the treatment of preterm labour ( P16233 ) , more emphasis has been placed on investigating the terminal synthases involved in the production of prostaglandins ( PGs ) to allow more targeted therapy in P16233 . Prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) is synthesized by one of three enzymes , cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase ( Q15185 ) , microsomal O14684 -1 ( mPGES-1 ) and microsomal O14684 -2 ( Q9H7Z7 ) . We have determined ( i ) the immuno-localization of all three O14684 enzymes in lower segment pregnant human myometrium , ( ii ) the expression of O14684 and P35354 mRNA expression at term and preterm gestation with and without labour and ( iii ) the effect of interleukin ( IL ) -1beta on P35354 and O14684 mRNA and protein expression in human myometrial smooth muscle ( HMSM ) cell cultures . We show mPGES-1 protein located predominantly in myometrial and vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) , whilst Q9H7Z7 protein is largely in stromal cells surrounding the SMC and Q15185 is diffusely located throughout the myometrium . Expression of Q9H7Z7 mRNA increased with term labour and P16233 and expression of P35354 and mPGES-1 mRNA with term labour , whereas Q15185 expression did not change . IL-1beta stimulated release of PGE(2) by HMSM cells and increased P35354 and mPGES-1 mRNA and protein expression . Thus , P35354 expression and mPGES-1 expression are co-ordinately up-regulated in lower segment myometrium with term labour and with IL-1beta treatment in HMSM cells .
