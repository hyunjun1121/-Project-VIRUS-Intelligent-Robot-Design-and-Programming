Targeted deletion of cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 produced enhanced inflammatory responses to influenza A/PR/8/34 in the absence and presence of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol . We have previously reported that Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta(9)-THC ) -treated mice challenged with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 ( PR8 ) developed increased viral hemagglutinin 1 ( H1 ) mRNA levels and decreased monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment to the pulmonary airways when compared with mice challenged with PR8 alone . The objective of the present study was to examine the role of cannabinoid ( CB(1)/CB(2) ) receptors in mediating the effects of Delta(9)-THC on immune and epithelial cell responses to PR8 . In the current study , Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)/CB(2) receptor null ( CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- ) and wild-type mice infected with PR8 had marked increases in viral H1 mRNA when compared with CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- and wild-type mice challenged with PR8 alone . However , the magnitude of the H1 mRNA levels was greatly reduced in CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice as compared with wild-type mice . In addition , Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice infected with PR8 had increased P01730 + T cells and P01579 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with greater pulmonary inflammation when compared with Delta(9)-THC-treated wild-type mice infected with PR8 . Delta(9)-THC treatment of CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- mice in the presence or absence of PR8 challenge also developed greater amounts of mucous cell metaplasia in the affected bronchiolar epithelium . Collectively , the immune and airway epithelial cell responses to PR8 challenge in Delta(9)-THC-treated CB(1)-/-/CB(2)-/- and wild-type mice indicated the involvement of CB(1)/CB(2) receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms .
