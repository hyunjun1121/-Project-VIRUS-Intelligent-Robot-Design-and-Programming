Increased contribution of Q12879 subunit to synaptic DB01221 receptors in developing rat cortical neurons . 1. Pharmacologically isolated miniature DB01221 receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mN-EPSCs ) were recorded in large visual cortical neurons in layer V of rat cortical slices . DB00502 ( 100 microM ) and CP101,606 ( 10 microM ) , two specific blockers of DB01221 receptors comprising Q9UHB4 / Q13224 subunits , were tested on mN-EPSCs in rats at postnatal days 7 and 8 ( Q0GE19 -P8 ) and P13-P15 . At both ages tested , no significant effects of these drugs were seen in the whole population of neurons , although in few neurons at both ages changes in amplitude were observed with haloperidol . Other dopamine receptor antagonists , spiperone and clozapine , failed to decrease mN-EPSCs in cortical neurons at P13-P15 . 2 . CP101,606 ( 10 microM ) significantly decreased the amplitude of evoked N-EPSCs ( eN-EPSCs ) in visual cortical slices from rats at P09131 - Q15084 , a developmental stage at which mRNA studies have indicated the virtual absence of Q12879 mRNA . CP101,606 failed to significantly change evoked AMPA-mediated EPSCs at Q15084 and eN-EPSCs at Q0GE19 -P8 and P13-P15 . 3 . DB01221 receptor-mediated currents were also studied in somatic outside-out patches at P13-P15 with fast application of L-glutamate ( 1 mM ) . DB00502 ( 50 microM ) and CP101,606 ( 10 muM ) blocked these currents in all patches tested . The effect of CP101,606 was concentration dependent . 4 . We suggest that rather early in development synaptic receptors comprising Q9UHB4 / Q13224 subunits could be associated with other subunits so that blockade by haloperidol and CP101,606 is prevented . Moreover , the consistent blockade seen in outside out patches might be ascribed to the confinement of Q9UHB4 / Q13224 receptors to an extrasynaptic population .
