DB01296 sulfate inhibits P01375 and P01579 -induced production of P05362 in human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro . PURPOSE : DB01296 sulfate ( GS ) is a naturally occurring sugar that possesses some immunosuppressive effects in vitro and in vivo , but its mechanism is unknown . We investigated whether GS could modulate the proinflammatory cytokine-induced expression of the gene for intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 , an inflammatory protein in human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells . METHODS : ARPE-19 cells were used as a model to determine the effects of GS on the expression of the P05362 gene upregulated by P01375 or P01579 , by Western blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The activation and nuclear translocation of the nuclear factors NF-kappaB and P42224 were evaluated by immunocytochemistry , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) . RESULTS : Both P01375 and P01579 increased the expression of P05362 at the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells . GS effectively downregulated the P01375 - or P01579 -induced expression of P05362 in the protein and mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner . GS further inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 proteins in P01375 and phosphorylated P42224 in P01579 -stimulated ARPE-19 cells . CONCLUSIONS : GS inhibits the expression of the P05362 gene in ARPE-19 cell stimulated with P01375 or P01579 through blockade of NF-kappaB subunit p65 and nuclear translocation of P42224 . This study has demonstrated a potentially important property of GS in reducing P05362 mediated inflammatory mechanisms in the eye .
