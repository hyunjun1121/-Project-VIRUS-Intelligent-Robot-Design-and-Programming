Early effects of topoisomerase I inhibition on RNA polymerase II along transcribed genes in human cells . We have determined the early effects of camptothecin and alpha-amanitin on genomic DNA-binding sites of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) , TATA-binding protein ( P20226 ) , P11387 ( Top1 ) , and histone components in human transcribed loci by chromatin-immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) . The two agents caused notably different alterations in active chromatin . DB04690 induced a specific reduction of RNAPII density at promoter pause sites and histone modifications suggesting an increased chromatin accessibility . alpha-Amanitin caused an accumulation of RNAPII at transcribed genes , a reduction of P20226 bound to chromatin and a less accessible chromatin structure . Interestingly , RNAPII reduction at promoter pause sites occurred within 5-10min of camptothecin treatment , and was not a response to replication-dependent DNA breaks . ChIP analyses of RNAPII along transcribed genes indicated that RNAPII levels were transiently increased at internal exons , and that camptothecin effects could be fully reversed by DRB , a cdk inhibitor . Top1 was found to be enriched in active chromatin , therefore suggesting that Top1 inhibition at the transcribed template and/or adjacent regulating regions immediately affects RNAPII at active genes . The findings are novel in vivo evidence of camptothecin effects on RNAPII bound to transcribing genomic regions , and are consistent with the hypothesis that Top1 activity can be involved in transcription regulation at the level of promoter clearance .
