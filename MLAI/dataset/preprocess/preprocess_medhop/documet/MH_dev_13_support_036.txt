Differences in transcript levels of ABC transporters between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and nonneoplastic tissues . OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to evaluate transcript levels of all 49 human DB00171 -binding cassette transporters ( ABCs ) in one of the most drug-resistant cancers , namely , the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . Association of ABCs levels with clinical-pathologic characteristics and P01116 mutation status was followed as well . METHODS : Tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues were obtained from 32 histologically verified PDAC patients . The transcript profile of ABCs was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with a relative standard curve . P01116 mutations in exon 2 were assessed by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing . RESULTS : Most ABCs were deregulated in PDAC and 10 ABCs were associated with clinical-pathologic characteristics . P01116 mutations did not change the global expression profile of ABCs . CONCLUSIONS : The expression of ABC transporters was significantly deregulated in PDAC tumors when compared to nonmalignant tissues . The observed up-regulation of P21439 , O95342 , P33527 , O15438 , O15440 , Q5T3U5 , and Q9UNQ0 in tumors may contribute to the generally poor treatment response of PDAC . The up-regulation of O95477 , Q8IZY2 , and P45844 implicates a serious impairment of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in PDAC . On the other hand , the observed down-regulation of Q99758 , O95255 , P13569 , and Q09428 suggests a possible role of stem cells in the development and progression of PDAC .
