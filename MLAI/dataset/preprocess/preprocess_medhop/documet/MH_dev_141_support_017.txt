Internet resources in GPCR modelling . G-Protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , one of the most important families of drug targets , belong to the super family of integral membrane proteins characterized by seven transmembrane helices . Because they are difficult to crystallize , the three dimensional structure of these receptors have not yet been determined by X-ray crystallography , except one . In the absence of a 3-D structure , in-silico approaches for solving the structure of this class of proteins are widely used and provide valuable information for structure based drug design . There are several web servers and computer programs available that automate the modelling process of GPCRs . Some of these include Modeller , Swiss-Model server , Homer , etc . Using these tools reliable homology models of human histamine H1 receptor ( P35367 ) and thrombin receptor ( P25116 ) have been generated which explain the binding mode of the standard antagonists of these receptors and may be useful in designing their novel antagonists .
