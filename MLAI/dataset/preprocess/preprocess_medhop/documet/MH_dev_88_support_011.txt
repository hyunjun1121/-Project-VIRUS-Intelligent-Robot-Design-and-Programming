A pegylated growth hormone receptor antagonist , pegvisomant , does not enter the brain in humans . BACKGROUND : GH receptors exist in the hippocampus , cerebral cortex , and hypothalamus , possibly influencing mood , cortical blood flow , and neuronal growth and mediating negative feedback . RATIONALE : DB00082 is a recombinant mutated GH molecule with high affinity , but little or no activating capability , for the P10912 . It is used clinically as a GH antagonist . HYPOTHESIS : Systemic pegvisomant enters brain interstitial fluid via putative choroid-plexus GH receptors , thereby allowing for antagonism of central actions of GH . SUBJECTS AND LOCATION : Six adults requiring a cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) examination for nonneoplastic and noninflammatory syndromes participated at a tertiary medical center . METHODS : Direct assays were conducted of serum and P04141 pegvisomant concentrations 18-24 h after sc injection of pegvisomant ( 20 mg ) . OUTCOMES : Median ( range ) concentrations of pegvisomant in serum were 215 ( 74-539 ) microg/liter and in P04141 0.035 ( 0.010-0.28 ) microg/liter ( P=0.016 ) . P04141 drug levels were indistinguishable from assay threshold . Corresponding GH values were 0.29 ( 0.010-1.3 ) in serum and 0.075 microg/liter ( 0.01-0.13 ) in P04141 . The geometric mean ratios of serum/ P04141 pegvisomant and GH concentrations were 5116:1 and 3.5:1 , respectively , thus defining a more than 1400-fold difference between mutated and natural GH . CONCLUSIONS : Based upon P04141 measurements , a pegylated GH-receptor antagonist does not cross the human blood-brain barrier , thereby sparing inhibition of central nervous system GH actions . Thus , the capability of this antagonist to stimulate GH secretion predominantly reflects its actions outside the blood-brain barrier , such as via the median eminence and/or via suppression of P05019 concentrations .
