Effects of aspirin on atherosclerosis and the cyclooxygenase-2 expression in atherosclerotic rabbits . BACKGROUND : Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular inflammatory disease . DB00945 is a mainstay in the prevention of vascular complications of atherosclerosis . In this study , the effectiveness of aspirin in suppressing atherosclerosis and the inflammation process was evaluated in rabbits fed with a high fat diet . METHODS : Eighteen male New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups : control group , untreated cholesterol-fed group , aspirin treated cholesterol-fed group , which were fed for 12 weeks . After 12 weeks , the aorta was harvested for pathologic morphology observation . Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , macrophage and vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) was performed . The statistical analysis was performed by the statistical program SPSS10.0 . RESULTS : The aorta plaque/intima size ( P/I ) by pathologic morphology observation was 0 % , ( 59.6 +/- 13.7 ) % and ( 36.3 +/- 16.5 ) % in the control , untreated cholesterol-fed group and aspirin treated group , respectively . The maximum plaque thickness , the degree of artery stenosis and the proportion of the intimal circumference occupied by atheroma of the 3 groups were significantly different from each other ( P < 0.01 ) . The expression of P35354 and macrophage in plaque of the aspirin treated group were decreased compared with that in untreated cholesterol-fed group . However , no difference was found in the expression of VSMC between the aspirin treated and the untreated cholesterol-fed group . CONCLUSION : The mechanism of atherosclerosis suppression by aspirin in cholesterol-fed rabbits is related to the inhibition of P35354 expression together with the reduced inflammation followed by , but not related to the hypolipidemic effects .
