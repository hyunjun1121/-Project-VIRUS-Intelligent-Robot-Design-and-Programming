Differential regulation of chondrogenic differentiation by the serotonin2B receptor and retinoic acid in the embryonic mouse hindlimb . Retinoic acid ( RA ) synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes are coordinately expressed with serotonin 2B ( P41595 ) receptors at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal ( E-M ) interaction in the mouse embryo ( Bhasin et al. , 1999 ) . The promoter of the P41595 receptor contains potential RA response element ( RAREs ) as well as an P05549 site . Because both retinoid and serotonergic signaling have been implicated in the regulation of chondrogenic differentiation , the present study investigated whether these signals may work together to regulate this morphogenetic process in hindlimb bud micromass cultures . Results indicate that 5-HT promotes [35S]sulfate incorporation ( chondrogenic differentiation ) by activation of P41595 receptors , which use the mitogen activated protein kinase ( Q8NFH3 MAPK ) signal transduction pathway , whereas RA dose-dependently inhibits sulfate incorporation and promotes expression of RARbeta , which could lead to inhibition of p38 MAPK . No evidence was found to support the possibility that RA negatively regulates expression of P41595 receptors . Taken together , these results suggest that 5-HT and RA may act as opposing signals to regulate chondrogenic differentiation in the developing hindlimb , possibly mediated by different MAPK signal transduction pathways .
