P01308 signaling in fatty acid and fat synthesis : a transcriptional perspective . Transcription of enzymes involved in FA and TAG synthesis is coordinately induced in lipogenic tissues by feeding and insulin treatment . The three major transcription factors involved are P22415 , SREBP-1c , and LXRα . New insights into the insulin-signaling pathway(s) that control(s) lipogenic gene transcription via these factors have recently been revealed . Dephosphorylation/activation of DNA-PK by P50391 causes phosphorylation of P22415 that in turn recruits Q92831 to be acetylated for transcriptional activation . SREBP-1c can be induced by mTORC1 , bifurcating lipogenesis from AKT-activated gluconeogenesis . LXRα may serve as a glucose sensor and , along with Q9NP71 , may activate lipogenic genes in the fed state . Dysregulation of FA and TAG metabolism often contributes to metabolic diseases such as obesity , diabetes , and cardiovascular diseases . Transcription factors and signaling molecules involved in transcriptional activation of FA and TAG synthesis represent attractive targets for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases .
