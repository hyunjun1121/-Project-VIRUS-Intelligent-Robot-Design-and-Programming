P08908 receptor activation : short-term effects on the mRNA expression of the P08908 receptor and galanin in the raphe nuclei . Systemic administration of the P08908 receptor agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ; 0.3 mg/kg , s.c. ) was used to explore the effects of activation of P08908 receptors on expression of mRNA coding for P08908 receptor , tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) and galanin in the ascending raphe nuclei . 8-OH-DPAT increased the hybridization signal of the P08908 receptor by 105 % in the dorsal raphe nucleus ( P33681 ) 30 min after the injection . No effects were seen at the later time points ( 2-8 h ) . In the median raphe nucleus ( B8 ) and the B9 cell group in the medial lemniscus , 8-OH-DPAT induced a marked decrease in labeling 30 min after injection . At 8 h following 8-OH-DPAT injection , the effect had shifted to an increase in P08908 receptor labeling by 68 % in the B8 area . Importantly 8-OH-DPAT had no significant effects on the expression of mRNA coding for P17752 and galanin . The results suggest an important and differential mechanism for the regulation of P08908 receptor mRNA levels in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei . This regulation may be of importance for the differential control of the activity of the ascending 5-HT neurons , and hence for mood regulation . The results also indicate a dissociation between the effects mediated by P08908 receptor functions and those regulating the coexisting peptide galanin in the dorsal raphe .
