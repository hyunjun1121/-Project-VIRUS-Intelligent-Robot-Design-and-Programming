Reduced expression of flavocytochrome b558 , a component of the NADPH oxidase complex , in neutrophils from patients with myelodysplasia . OBJECTIVE : Patients with myelodysplasia ( P43034 ) show a disturbed production of ROS in response to N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine ( fMLP ) in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) -primed neutrophils . Because generation of ROS is mediated by the NADPH oxidase complex , a component of which is flavocytochrome b558 , we investigated whether the expression of flavocytochrome b558 in neutrophils from P43034 patients is affected . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Neutrophils were stimulated with fMLP and GM- P04141 , and plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b558 and specific granule markers were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis . Protein levels of the flavocytochrome b558 subunits gp91phox and P13498 in whole neutrophil lysates were detected by Western blotting . RESULTS : Stimulation of neutrophils with GM- P04141 and fMLP increased the flavocytochrome b558 plasma membrane expression . The fMLP-induced translocation of flavocytochrome b558 was reduced in neutrophils from P43034 patients ( 140 % +/-9 % vs 180 % +/-13 % , p < 0.05 ) . Analysis of cell surface expression of markers of flavocytochrome b558 containing granules ( CD35 and CD66b ) indicated that exocytosis of these granules in response to fMLP stimulation was not affected in P43034 patients . Western blot analysis demonstrated a decreased protein expression level of the flavocytochrome b558 subunits gp91phox and P13498 in neutrophils from P43034 patients . CONCLUSION : Our results indicate both a lower basal protein level and a disturbed fMLP-induced increase in plasma membrane expression of flavocytochrome b558 in neutrophils from P43034 patients , which together might play a role in decreased ROS production .
