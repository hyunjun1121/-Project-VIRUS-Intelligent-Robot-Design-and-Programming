P10275 YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration . X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration . SBMA is caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor ( AR ) . To determine the basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity , we introduced human AR yeast artificial chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells . The AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset , gradually progressive neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration , indicating striking recapitulation of the human disease . We then tested the hypothesis that polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein ( CBP ) -mediated transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and observed altered CBP-AR binding and P15692 reduction in AR100 mice . We found that mutant AR-induced death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by P15692 . Our results suggest that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of P15692 , consistent with a role for P15692 as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease .
