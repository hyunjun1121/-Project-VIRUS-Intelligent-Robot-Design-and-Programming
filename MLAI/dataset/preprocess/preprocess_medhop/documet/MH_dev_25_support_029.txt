Synergistic proliferative action of insulin-like growth factor I and 17 beta-estradiol in MCF-7S breast tumor cells . We have analyzed the mechanism by which the combination of insulin-like growth factor I ( P05019 ) and 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) induces cell cycle progression in MCF-7S cells . This cell line differs from many other breast cancer-derived cell lines in that E2 ( 1 nM ) does not induce cell cycle progression , whereas the combination of submitogenic concentrations of P05019 ( 2 ng/ml ) and E2 does . We find that addition of P05019 to MCF-7S cells leads to a dose-dependent activation of the IGF type I receptor and of the Q96HU1 kinase and P19957 -kinase signaling pathways . No synergy of P05019 and E2 was detected in the activation of these signaling cascades . In terms of cell cycle-related molecules , we find that P05019 dose-dependently raises cyclin D1 levels in serum-starved cells . Subsequent activation of cyclin E/ P24941 , hyperphosphorylation of P06400 , and DNA synthesis are only induced by mitogenic concentrations of P05019 ( > or =20 ng/ml ) . Treatment of the cells with E2 also results in the induction of cyclin D1 , but in the absence of P05019 the cells remain arrested in P55008 phase . We conclude that in MCF-7S cells , the synergistic action of E2 and P05019 derives from the ability of both hormones to induce cyclin D1 expression . The action of P05019 is required in these cells to induce activity of the cyclin D1/ P11802 complex , which triggers progression through the cell cycle .
