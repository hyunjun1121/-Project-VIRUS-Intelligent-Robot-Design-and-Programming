DB08875 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma by a dual blockade of P35968 and MET . PURPOSE : MET signaling has been suggested a potential role in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) and associated with prometastasis during antiangiogenesis therapy . We investigated the potential association between MET expression and therapeutic response to sorafenib in patients with HCC . Antitumor effects of cabozantinib , a dual inhibitor of MET and P35968 , were examined in cultured HCC cells as well as in vivo models . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Total MET and phosphorylated MET ( p-MET ) were measured in 29 resected HCC specimens , and correlated with response to sorafenib as postoperative adjuvant therapy . In the second set of experiments using cultured HCC cells , and mouse xenograft and metastatic models , effects of cabozantinib were examined . RESULTS : High level of p-MET in resected HCC specimens was associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib therapy . In cultured HCC cells that expressed p-MET , cabozantinib inhibited the activity of MET and its downstream effectors , leading to P55008 -phase arrest . DB08875 inhibited tumor growth in p-MET-positive and p-MET-negative HCC by decreasing angiogenesis , inhibiting proliferation , and promoting apoptosis , but it exhibited more profound efficacy in p-MET-positive HCC xenografts . DB08875 blocked the hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) -stimulated MET pathway and inhibited the migration and invasion of the HCC cells . Notably , cabozantinib reduced the number of metastatic lesions in the lung and liver in the experimental metastatic mouse model . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with HCC with high level of p-MET are associated with resistance to adjuvant sorafenib treatment . The dual blockade of P35968 and MET by cabozantinib has significant antitumor activities in HCC , and the activation of MET in HCC may be a promising efficacy-predicting biomarker .
