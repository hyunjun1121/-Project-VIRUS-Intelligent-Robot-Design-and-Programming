Transforming growth factor-beta is a strong and fast acting positive regulator of the level of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor mRNA in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts . We have studied the mechanism of a transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) -stimulated production of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts . TGF-beta causes an early increase in the P05121 mRNA level which reaches a maximal 50-fold enhancement after 8 h . Blocking of protein synthesis with cycloheximide causes an equally strong increase in the level of P05121 mRNA . Quantitative studies of the effect of TGF-beta on P05121 protein levels in cell extracts and culture media by using monoclonal antibodies are consistent with the effect on P05121 mRNA . The results suggest a primary effect of TGF-beta on P05121 gene transcription , and also suggest the possibility that the transcription of this gene in non-induced cells may be suppressed by a short-lived negatively regulating protein . DB00013 -type ( u-PA ) and tissue-type ( t-PA ) plasminogen activators are decreased in the culture media of TGF-beta-treated cells concomitantly with the increase in P05121 accumulation . These findings show that a primary and important biological effect of TGF-beta may be an overall decreased extracellular proteolytic activity , and give an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-beta action at the genetic level .
