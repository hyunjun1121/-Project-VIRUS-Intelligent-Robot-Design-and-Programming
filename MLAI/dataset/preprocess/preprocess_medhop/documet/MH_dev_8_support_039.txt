DB08932 slows down the dermal fibrotic process in systemic sclerosis : in vitro findings . Systemic sclerosis ( or scleroderma ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by skin and internal organ fibrosis , caused by microvascular dysfunction . The microvascular damage seems to be a consequence of an endothelial autoimmune response , followed by activation of the inflammatory cascade and massive deposition of collagen . P05305 ( ET-1 ) contributes to the inflammatory and fibrotic processes by increasing the concentration of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines , and it is considered one of the most relevant mediators of vascular damage in scleroderma . It is indeed found in very high concentration in serum of sclerodermic patients . Moreover , in these pathological conditions there is an increased expression of ET-1 receptors ( P25101 and ETB ) , which mediate the detrimental action of ET-1 , and often a change of P25101 /ETB ratio . The aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of macitentan , an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist , and its major metabolite ( ACT-132577 ) on alpha smooth muscle actin ( alphaSMA ) expression , evaluated on dermal fibroblasts from healthy subjects and on dermal fibroblasts from lesional and non-lesional skin from sclerodermic patients . The combination of macitentan and its major metabolite reduced the levels of & #945;SMA after 48 h in sclerodermic fibroblasts from lesional skin . No relevant changes in & #945;SMA levels were found in fibroblasts from non-lesional skin , whose behavior is similar to that of dermal fibroblasts from healthy patients .
