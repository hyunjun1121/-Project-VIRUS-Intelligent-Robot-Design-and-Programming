Recruitment and subnuclear distribution of the regulatory machinery during 1alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-mediated transcriptional upregulation in osteoblasts . The architectural organization of the genome and regulatory proteins within the nucleus supports gene expression in a physiologically regulated manner . In osteoblastic cells ligand activation induces a nuclear punctate distribution of the 1alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) receptor ( P11473 ) and promotes its interaction with transcriptional coactivators such as Q15788 , NCoA-62/Skip , and Q15648 . Here , we discuss evidence demonstrating that in osteoblastic cells P11473 binds to the nuclear matrix fraction in a DB00136 -dependent manner . This interaction occurs rapidly after exposure to DB00136 and does not require a functional P11473 DNA binding domain . The nuclear matrix-bound P11473 molecules colocalize with the also nuclear matrix-associated coactivator Q15648 . We propose a model where the rapid association of P11473 with the nuclear matrix fraction represents an event that follows DB00136 -dependent nuclear localization of P11473 , but that precedes DB00136 -dependent transcriptional upregulation at target genes .
