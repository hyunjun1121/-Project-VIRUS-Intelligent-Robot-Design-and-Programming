Enhancement of L-cystine transport activity and its relation to Q9UPY5 gene induction at the blood-brain barrier by diethyl maleate treatment . The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of enhancement of L-cystine uptake at the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) . The uptake of [(14)C]L-cystine and [(3)H]L-glutamic acid ( L- DB00142 ) was determined using a mouse brain endothelial cell line ( MBEC4 ) as an in vitro BBB model . The mRNA levels of L-cystine/L- DB00142 exchanger , system x(c)(-) , which consists of Q9UPY5 and P08195 , were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis . The [(14)C]L-cystine uptake by MBEC4 cells appeared to be mediated via an Na(+)-independent saturable process . The corresponding Michaelis-Menten constant ( K(m) ) was 63.7 microM . In the presence of L- DB00142 , there was competitive inhibition with an inhibition constant ( K(i) ) of 83.5 microM . [(3)H]L- DB00142 uptake in the absence of Na(+) was saturable with a K(m) of 48.1 microM , and it exhibited competitive inhibition with a K(i) of 24.9 microM in the presence of L-cystine . The mutual inhibition between L-cystine and L- DB00142 and the type of inhibition suggest that system x(c)(-) operates in MBEC4 cells . The Q9UPY5 and P08195 mRNAs were expressed in MBEC4 cells and , following diethyl maleate ( DEM ) treatment , the Q9UPY5 mRNA level and L-cystine uptake in MBEC4 cells were enhanced in parallel with an increase in DEM concentration ( up to 500 microM ) . Concomitantly , the glutathione concentration in MBEC4 cells was increased . In conclusion , system x(c)(-)-mediated L-cystine uptake takes place in MBEC4 cells . DB00138 transport via system x(c)(-) at the BBB is likely to be induced under oxidative stress conditions following DEM treatment due to enhanced transcription of the Q9UPY5 gene .
