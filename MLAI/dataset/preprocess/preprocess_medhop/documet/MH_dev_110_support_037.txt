Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a full agonist at P21554 receptors on GABA neuron axon terminals in the hippocampus . Marijuana impairs learning and memory through actions of its psychoactive constituent , DB00470 ( Delta(9)-THC ) , in the hippocampus , through activation of cannabinoid P21554 receptors ( CB1R ) . CB1Rs are found on glutamate and GABA neuron axon terminals in the hippocampus where they control neurotransmitter release . Previous studies suggest that Delta(9)-THC is a partial agonist of CB1Rs on glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus , whereas its effects on GABA terminals have not been described . Using whole-cell electrophysiology in brain slices from C57BL6/J mice , we examined Delta(9)-THC effects on synaptic GABA IPSCs and postsynaptic GABA currents elicited by laser-induced photo-uncaging ( photolysis ) of alpha-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl ( P63098 ) caged GABA . Despite robust inhibition of synaptic IPSCs in wildtype mice by the full synthetic agonist WIN55,212-2 , using a Tween-80 and DB01093 vehicle , Delta(9)-THC had no effects on IPSCs in this , or in a low concentration of another vehicle , randomly-methylated beta-cyclodextrin ( RAMEB , 0.023 % ) . However , IPSCs were inhibited by Delta(9)-THC in 0.1 % RAMEB , but not in neurons from CB1R knockout mice . Whereas Delta(9)-THC did not affect photolysis-evoked GABA currents , these responses were prolonged by a GABA uptake inhibitor . Concentration-response curves revealed that the maximal effects of Delta(9)-THC and WIN55,212-2 were similar , indicating that Delta(9)-THC is a full agonist at CB1Rs on GABA axon terminals . These results suggest that Delta(9)-THC inhibits GABA release , but does not directly alter GABA(A) receptors or GABA uptake in the hippocampus . Furthermore , full agonist effects of Delta(9)-THC on IPSCs likely result from a much higher expression of CB1Rs on GABA versus glutamate axon terminals in the hippocampus .
