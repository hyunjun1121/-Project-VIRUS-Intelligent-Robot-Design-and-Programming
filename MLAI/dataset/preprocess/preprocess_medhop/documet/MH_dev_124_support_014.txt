Prolonged treatment with bicalutamide induces androgen receptor overexpression and androgen hypersensitivity . BACKGROUND : Various hormone refractory prostate cancer cell models have been established with androgen depletion and have helped to clarify the mechanism for the transition into androgen-depletion independent status . However , the mechanism of bicalutamide resistance remains unclear because few cell models have been generated . METHODS : We generated a bicalutamide-resistant subline , LNCaP- O43633 , from LNCaP after prolonged treatment with bicalutamide . Androgen and/or bicalutamide responsiveness for proliferation and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) secretion were examined in vitro and in vivo . DB00624 and dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) levels in xenografted tumors were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . P10275 ( AR ) gene mutation and amplification and AR and pAR(210) expression were determined . RESULTS : LNCaP- O43633 did not grow in an androgen-depleted medium and proliferation was stimulated in a tenfold lower concentration of androgen than that of LNCaP . LNCaP- O43633 grew in castrated male mice , and the DB02901 level in grafted LNCaP- O43633 tumors was 7.7-fold lower than in LNCaP tumors . DB01128 stimulated LNCaP- O43633 proliferation and PSA secretion in vitro and the antitumor activity of bicalutamide against LNCaP- O43633 was weaker than that of LNCaP in vivo . Additional AR mutation and AR gene amplification were not detected in LNCaP- O43633 , but AR and pAR(210) expression and PSA secretion in LNCaP- O43633 were higher than in LNCaP . CONCLUSIONS : DB01128 -resistant LNCaP- O43633 exhibited AR overexpression and hypersensitivity to low levels of androgen . Our data suggests that AR overexpression is a significant mechanism of bicalutamide resistance similar to resistance from chronic androgen depletion . In addition , pAR(210) overexpression could be a potential mechanism for hypersensitivity to low androgen in LNCaP- O43633 .
