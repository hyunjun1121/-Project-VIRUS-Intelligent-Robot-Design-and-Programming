Design , synthesis and biological evaluation of pazopanib derivatives as antitumor agents . A novel series of pazopanib derivatives were designed , synthesized , and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against a series of kinases including P35968 , P00533 , P31749 , P37023 , and P00519 . The anti-angiogenic activities ex vivo of some compounds were also investigated . Compounds P2d and P2e demonstrated outstanding inhibitory activity against P35968 and P00519 and higher anti-angiogenic activity compared with DB06589 , the reference standard . These two compounds ( P2d and P2e ) could be used as novel lead compounds for further development of anticancer agents .
