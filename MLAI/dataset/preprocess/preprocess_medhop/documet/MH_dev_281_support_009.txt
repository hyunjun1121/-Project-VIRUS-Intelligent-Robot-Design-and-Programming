Acidic sphingomyelinase downregulates the liver-specific methionine adenosyltransferase 1A , contributing to tumor necrosis factor-induced lethal hepatitis . DB00118 ( DB00118 ) is synthesized by methionine adenosyltransferases ( MATs ) . Ablation of the liver-specific Q00266 gene results in liver neoplasia and sensitivity to oxidant injury . Here we show that acidic sphingomyelinase ( ASMase ) mediates the downregulation of Q00266 by P01375 . The levels of Q00266 mRNA as well as P24752 I/III protein decreased in cultured rat hepatocytes by in situ generation of ceramide from exogenous human placenta ASMase . Hepatocytes lacking the ASMase gene ( ASMase-/- ) were insensitive to P01375 but were responsive to exogenous ASMase-induced downregulation of Q00266 . In an in vivo model of lethal hepatitis by P01375 , depletion of DB00118 preceded activation of caspases 8 and 3 , massive liver damage , and death of the mice . In contrast , minimal hepatic DB00118 depletion , caspase activation , and liver damage were seen in ASMase-/- mice . Moreover , therapeutic treatment with DB00118 abrogated caspase activation and liver injury , thus rescuing ASMase+/+ mice from P01375 -induced lethality . Thus , we have demonstrated a new role for ASMase in P01375 -induced liver failure through downregulation of Q00266 , and maintenance of DB00118 may be useful in the treatment of acute and chronic liver diseases .
