Complex formation with the Type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor affects the expression and signal transduction of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor . Studies with P29320 -293 cells and neurons . We co-immunoprecipitated the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor ( CaR ) and type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor ( GABA-B-R ) from human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells expressing these receptors and from brain lysates where both receptors are present . CaRs extensively co-localized with the two subunits of the GABA-B-R ( Q96GN5 and R2 ) in P29320 -293 cell membranes and intracellular organelles . Coexpressing CaRs and GABA-B-R1s in P29320 -293 cells suppressed the total cellular and cell surface expression of CaRs and inhibited phospholipase C activation in response to high extracellular [ Ca(2+) ] ( [Ca(2+)](e) ) . In contrast , coexpressing CaRs and GABA-B-R2s enhanced CaR expression and signaling responses to raising [Ca(2+)](e) . The latter effects of the O75899 on the CaR were blunted by coexpressing the Q9UBS5 . Coexpressing the CaR with Q9UBS5 or R2 enhanced the total cellular and cell surface expression of the Q9UBS5 or R2 , respectively . Studies with truncated CaRs indicated that the N-terminal extracellular domain of the CaR participated in the interaction of the CaR with the Q9UBS5 and R2 . In cultured mouse hippocampal neurons , CaRs co-localized with the Q9UBS5 and R2 . CaRs and GABA-B-R1s also co-immunoprecipitated from brain lysates . The expression of the CaR was increased in lysates from Q9UBS5 knock-out mouse brains and in cultured hippocampal neurons with their Q9UBS5 genes deleted in vitro . Thus , CaRs and GABA-B-R subunits can form heteromeric complexes in cells , and their interactions affect cell surface expression and signaling of CaR , which may contribute to extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent receptor activation in target tissues .
