Overview of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical breast cancer . Studies of cell models and profiling of clinical breast cancer material to reveal the mechanisms of resistance to anti-oestrogen therapy , and to tamoxifen in particular , have reported that this phenomenon can be associated with increased expression and signalling through erbB Type 1 growth factor receptors , notably the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and P04626 . Further molecular studies have revealed an intricate interlinking between such growth factor receptor pathways and oestrogen receptor ( ER ) signalling . Inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity involved in the P00533 signalling cascade forms the basis for the use of P00533 specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors exemplified by gefitinib ( ZD1839 , DB00317 ) and erlotinib ( DB00530 , Tarceva ) . Such agents have proved promising in pre-clinical studies and are currently in clinical trials in breast cancer , where gefitinib has been studied more extensively to date . Here , we present an overview of the current development of gefitinib in clinical breast cancer . This includes results from our clinical breast cancer trial 1839IL/0057 that demonstrate the efficacy of gefitinib within ER-positive , tamoxifen-resistant patients with locally advanced/metastatic disease , where parallel decreases in P00533 signal transduction and the Ki67 ( Q86YT6 ) proliferation marker can be detected as predicted from model system studies . We also consider trials examining combination treatment with gefitinib and anti-hormonal strategies that will begin to address the clinically important question of whether gefitinib can delay/prevent onset of anti-hormone resistance .
