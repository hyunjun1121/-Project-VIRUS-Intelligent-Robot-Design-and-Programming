Molecular targeting therapy against promyelocytic leukemia protein using arsenic acids in experimental intracranial medulloblastoma . Our previous study using human Daoy medulloblastoma cells showed that the promyelocytic leukemia ( P29590 ) gene was significantly upregulated ( 2.5-fold ) in cells positive to prominin-1 antigen ( CD133 ) , a possible marker for cancer initiating cells . DB01169 ( As(2)O(3) ) is known to degrade P29590 protein and has been used for the treatment of patients with acute P29590 . In the present study , the effect of P29590 targeting therapy with As(2)O(3) and cytarabine ( DB00987 ) on Daoy medulloblastoma cell proliferation was investigated . Daoy cells were pretreated with As(2)O(3) for 6 weeks . The As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were cultured in medium containing DB00987 and cell viability was examined . Next , the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells were inoculated into the nude mouse brain and the effect of DB00987 on the tumor size was evaluated . A significant increase in chemosensitivity to DB00987 was observed in the As(2)O(3)-pretreated Daoy cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions . P29590 and P24385 ( cyclin D1 ) protein expression of Daoy medulloblastoma cells was downregulated by As(2)O(3) treatment . P29590 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target to eradicate quiescent leukemia-initiating cells , and P29590 -expressing CD133-positive cells are similarly a potential therapeutic target of treatment for medulloblastoma .
