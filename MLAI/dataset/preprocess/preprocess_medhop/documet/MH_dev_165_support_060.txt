EV71 induces P35354 expression via c-Src/ P09619 /PI3K/Akt/ Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK/AP-1 and NF-kappaB in rat brain astrocytes . Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) induces the expression of cyclooxgenase ( P36551 ) -2 served as a major neurotoxic factor in CNS injury . However , the mechanisms underlying EV71-initiated intracellular signaling pathways leading to P35354 expression remain unknown . Therefore , we investigated the mechanisms underlying EV71-induced P35354 expression and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) production in rat brain astrocytes ( RBA ) -1 , determined by Western blotting , RT-PCR , and promoter assay . Here , we reported that EV71-induced P35354 expression and PGE(2) production were attenuated by pretreatment with the inhibitors of c-Src ( P50391 ) , P09619 ( AG1296 ) , PI3K ( Wortmannin ) , Q02750 /2 ( PD98059 ) , NF-kappaB ( helenalin ) , and AP-1 ( Tanshinone ) and transfection with shRNA or siRNA of c-Src , P09619 , p85 , c-Jun , c-Fos , P27361 , or P28482 . We further observed that EV71-induced activation of Akt and Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK were mediated via c-Src and P09619 . Pretreatment with P50391 attenuated EV71-stimulated phosphorylation of Src , P09619 , Akt , and Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK . Inhibition of PI3K by Wortmannin attenuated EV71-induced Akt and Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK phosphorylation , but had no effect on P09619 phosphorylation , suggesting that P09619 is an upstream and Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK is a downstream component of PI3K/Akt in these responses . EV71-stimulated NF-kappaB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , P25963 degradation and NF-kappaB promoter activity were attenuated by pretreatment with helenalin , but not AG1296 , Wortmannin , and PD98059 . EV71-induced c-Jun mRNA expression was attenuated by pretreatment with PD98059 , AG1296 , or Wortmannin . These results demonstrate that in RBA-1 cells , EV71-induced P35354 expression associated with PGE(2) production is mediated through activation of c-Src/ P09619 /PI3K/Akt/ Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK to initiate the expression of AP-1 .
