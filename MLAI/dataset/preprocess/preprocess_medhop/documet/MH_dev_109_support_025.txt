Potential future clinical applications for the P08514 /IIIa antagonist , abciximab in thrombosis , vascular and oncological indications . DB00054 ( ReoPro ) is a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody Fab fragment of the parent murine monoclonal antibody DB00054 , and was the first of these agents approved for use as adjunct therapy for the prevention of cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) . DB00054 binds with high avidity to both the non-activated and activated form of the P08514 /IIIa receptor of platelets , the major adhesion receptor involved in aggregation . Additional cardiovascular indications for abciximab are unstable angina , carotid stenting , ischemic stroke and peripheral vascular diseases . DB00054 also interacts with two other integrin receptors ; the a av b b3 receptor , which is present in low numbers on platelets but in high density on activated endothelial and smooth muscle cells , and a aMb b2 integrin which is present on activated leukocytes . Cell types that express integrins P08514 /IIIa and a av b b3 such as platelets , endothelial and tumor cells have been implicated in angiogenesis , tumor growth and metastasis . Since abciximab interacts with high avidity to integrins P08514 /IIIa and a av b b3 , it is reasonable to assume that it may possess anti-angiogenic properties in angiogenesis-related diseases , as well as anti-metastastatic properties in case of disseminating tumors expressing the target integrin receptors .
