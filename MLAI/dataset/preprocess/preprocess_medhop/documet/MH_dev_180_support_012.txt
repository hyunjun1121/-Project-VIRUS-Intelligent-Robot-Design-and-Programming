Adolescent exposure to oxytocin , but not the selective oxytocin receptor agonist TGOT , increases social behavior and plasma oxytocin in adulthood . There are indications that exposing adolescent rodents to oxytocin ( OT ) may have positive " trait-changing " effects resulting in increased sociability and decreased anxiety that last well beyond acute drug exposure and into adulthood . Such findings may have relevance to the utility of OT in producing sustained beneficial effects in human psychiatric conditions . The present study further examined these effects using an intermittent regime of OT exposure in adolescence , and using Long Evans rats , that are generally more sensitive to the acute prosocial effects of OT . As OT has substantial affinity for the vasopressin V1a receptor ( P37288 ) in addition to the oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) , we examined whether a more selective peptidergic OTR agonist - [ Thr4 , Gly7 ] -oxytocin ( TGOT ) - would have similar lasting effects on behavior . Male Long Evans rats received OT or TGOT ( 0.5-1mg/kg , intraperitoneal ) , once every three days , for a total of 10 doses during adolescence ( postnatal day ( P01160 ) 28-55 ) . Social and anxiety-related behaviors were assessed during acute administration as well as later in adulthood ( from P01160 70 onwards ) . OT produced greater acute behavioral effects than TGOT , including an inhibition of social play and reduced rearing , most likely reflecting primary sedative effects . In adulthood , OT but not TGOT pretreated rats displayed lasting increases in social interaction , accompanied by an enduring increase in plasma OT . These findings confirm lasting behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of adolescent OT exposure . However , the absence of such effects with TGOT suggests possible involvement of the P37288 as well as the OTR in this example of developmental neuroplasticity .
