Induced segregation of human syntenic genes by 5-bromodeozyuridine + near-visible light . Chromosome-breaking agents have been used in two different procedures for promoting segregation of syntenic genes on human chromosome 12 . In method A , a human-Chinese hamster cell hybrid containing the single human chromosome 12 was treated either with 5-bromodeoxyuridine BrdU + near-visible light or with X-rays . In method B , normal human fibroblasts were treated with BrdU + near-visible light followed by their fusion with a Chinese hamster glycine-requiring cell mutant CHO- P04264 /gly-A . Since the human complementing gene for serine hydroxymethyltransferase , an enzyme deficient in gly-A , lies on human chromosome 12 , only those hybrids retaining that chromosome can survive the glycine-free medium . Clones isolated from both procedures were analyzed for the loss or retention of four other syntenic genes on chromosome 12 , P60174 , P04406 , LDH B , and PepB . The results demonstrate that method B is much more effective in generating clones with extensive marker losses . In addition , the segregation pattern and frequency obtained in this study provided information on the linear order of P60174 and P04406 on chromosome 12 .
