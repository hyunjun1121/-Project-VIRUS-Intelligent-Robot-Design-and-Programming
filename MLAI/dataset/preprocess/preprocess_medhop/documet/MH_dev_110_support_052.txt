Inhibition of recombinant human T-type calcium channels by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol . Delta(9)- DB00470 ( THC ) and cannabidiol ( DB09061 ) are the most prevalent biologically active constituents of Cannabis sativa . THC is the prototypic cannabinoid P21554 receptor agonist and is psychoactive and analgesic . DB09061 is also analgesic , but it is not a P21554 receptor agonist . Low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels , encoded by the Ca(V)3 gene family , regulate the excitability of many cells , including neurons involved in nociceptive processing . We examined the effects of THC and DB09061 on human Ca(V)3 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and T-type channels in mouse sensory neurons using whole-cell , patch clamp recordings . At moderately hyperpolarized potentials , THC and DB09061 inhibited peak Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2 currents with IC(50) values of approximately 1 mum but were less potent on Ca(V)3.3 channels . THC and DB09061 inhibited sensory neuron T-type channels by about 45 % at 1 mum . However , in recordings made from a holding potential of -70 mV , 100 nm THC or DB09061 inhibited more than 50 % of the peak Ca(V)3.1 current . THC and DB09061 produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the steady state inactivation potentials for each of the Ca(V)3 channels , which accounts for inhibition of channel currents . Additionally , THC caused a modest hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2 . THC but not DB09061 slowed Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.2 deactivation and inactivation kinetics . Thus , THC and DB09061 inhibit Ca(V)3 channels at pharmacologically relevant concentrations . However , THC , but not DB09061 , may also increase the amount of calcium entry following T-type channel activation by stabilizing open states of the channel .
