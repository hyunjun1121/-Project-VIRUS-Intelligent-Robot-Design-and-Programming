Anti-inflammatory activity of topical THC in DNFB-mediated mouse allergic contact dermatitis independent of P21554 and CB2 receptors . BACKGROUND : ∆(9) - DB00470 ( THC ) , the active constituent of Cannabis sativa , exerts its biological effects in part through the G-protein-coupled P21554 and CB2 receptors , which were initially discovered in brain and spleen tissue , respectively . However , THC also has P21554 /2 receptor-independent effects . Because of its immune-inhibitory potential , THC and related cannabinoids are being considered for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases . Here we investigated the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of THC and the role of P21554 and CB2 receptors . METHODS : We evaluated the impact of topically applied THC on DNFB-mediated allergic contact dermatitis in wild-type and P21554 /2 receptor-deficient mice . We performed immunohistochemical analyses for infiltrating immune cells and studied the influence of THC on the interaction between T cells , keratinocytes and myeloid immune cells in vitro . RESULTS : Topical THC application effectively decreased contact allergic ear swelling and myeloid immune cell infiltration not only in wild-type but also in P21554 /2 receptor-deficient mice . We found that THC ( 1 ) inhibited the production of IFNγ by T cells , ( 2 ) decreased the production of P13500 and of IFNγ-induced P80075 and CXL10 by epidermal keratinocytes and ( 3 ) thereby limited the recruitment of myeloid immune cells in vitro in a P21554 /2 receptor-independent manner . CONCLUSIONS : Topically applied THC can effectively attenuate contact allergic inflammation by decreasing keratinocyte-derived pro-inflammatory mediators that orchestrate myeloid immune cell infiltration independent of P21554 /2 receptors . This has important implications for the future development of strategies to harness cannabinoids for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases .
