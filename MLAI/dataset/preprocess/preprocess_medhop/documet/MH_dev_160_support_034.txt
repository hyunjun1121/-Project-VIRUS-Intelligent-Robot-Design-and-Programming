Episcleritis Related to Drug-Induced Lupus Erythematosus following DB00065 Therapy : A Case Report . Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is defined as a lupus-like syndrome temporally related to continuous drug exposure which resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug . Herein , we describe a patient with distinct clinical manifestations of anti- P01375 -associated DILE related to infliximab therapy . The patient exhibited clinical and laboratory findings of lupus-like illnesses as well as ocular disorders , such as episcleritis . The main message is that the symptoms of DILE should not be overlooked , although sometimes other systematic conditions may underlie them . As a result , it is very important for the clinicians to evaluate the symptoms of DILE and manage appropriately these cases .
