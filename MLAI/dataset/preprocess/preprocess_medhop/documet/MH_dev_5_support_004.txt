The anti-inflammatory drug BAY 11-7082 suppresses the MyD88-dependent signalling network by targeting the ubiquitin system . The compound BAY 11-7082 inhibits IκBα [ inhibitor of NF-κB ( nuclear factor κB ) α ] phosphorylation in cells and has been used to implicate the canonical IKKs ( IκB kinases ) and NF-κB in > 350 publications . In the present study we report that BAY 11-7082 does not inhibit the IKKs , but suppresses their activation in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated RAW macrophages and IL (interleukin)-1-stimulated IL-1R ( IL-1 receptor ) P29320 ( human embryonic kidney ) -293 cells . BAY 11-7082 exerts these effects by inactivating the E2-conjugating enzymes Ubc ( ubiquitin conjugating ) 13 and P68036 and the E3 ligase LUBAC ( linear ubiquitin assembly complex ) , thereby preventing the formation of Lys63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains . BAY 11-7082 prevents ubiquitin conjugation to P61088 and P68036 by forming a covalent adduct with their reactive cysteine residues via Michael addition at the P01024 atom of BAY 11-7082 , followed by the release of 4-methylbenzene-sulfinic acid . BAY 11-7082 stimulated Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation in cells and protected HIF1α ( hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ) from proteasomal degradation , suggesting that it inhibits the proteasome . The results of the present study indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of BAY 11-7082 , its ability to induce B-cell lymphoma and leukaemic T-cell death and to prevent the recruitment of proteins to sites of DNA damage are exerted via inhibition of components of the ubiquitin system and not by inhibiting NF-κB .
