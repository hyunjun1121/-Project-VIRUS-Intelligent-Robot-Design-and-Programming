Expression of O95997 and P60484 in endometrial carcinoma : correlation with tumorigenesis and progression . Human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 ( O95997 ) is a newly identified proto-oncogene , and its overexpression occurs in a wide variety of human cancers . The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 ( P60484 ) is frequently mutated or deleted in numerous tumors , especially in endometrial carcinoma . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the aberrant expression of O95997 and P60484 is associated with tumorigenesis and progression of endometrial carcinoma . Tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were undertaken in 124 endometrial carcinoma , 28 atypical hyperplasia and 35 normal endometrium samples . Then , the correlation of O95997 and P60484 expression with the clinicopathological features and with the levels of estrogen and progesterone receptor was analyzed . The presence of O95997 and P60484 protein was significantly increased and decreased , respectively , as lesions progressed from normal endometrium to atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma . O95997 protein showed a significantly positive correlation with TNM stage , but not with other characteristics . In addition , P60484 protein did not correlate with any parameters except for histological grade , to which it was found to be inversely related . Statistical analysis confirmed a significant relationship between an increase in O95997 and a decrease in P60484 . These results indicate that high expression of O95997 and low expression of P60484 may be involved in pathogenesis and development of endometrial carcinoma . The findings also provide evidence that combined evaluation of the two markers may be useful in predicting tumor behavior and thus prognosis .
