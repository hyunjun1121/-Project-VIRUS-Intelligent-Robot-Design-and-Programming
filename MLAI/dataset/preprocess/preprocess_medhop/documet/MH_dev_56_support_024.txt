MnSOD drives neuroendocrine differentiation , androgen independence , and cell survival in prostate cancer cells . An increase in neuroendocrine ( NE ) cell number has been associated with progression of prostate tumor , one of the most frequent cancers among Western males . We previously reported that mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) increases during the NE differentiation process . The goal of this study was to find whether MnSOD up-regulation is enough to induce NE differentiation . Several human prostate cancer LNCaP cell clones stably overexpressing MnSOD were characterized and two were selected ( MnSOD-S4 and MnSOD- P28222 ) . MnSOD overexpression induces NE morphological features as well as coexpression of the NE marker synaptophysin . Both MnSOD clones exhibit lower superoxide levels and higher H(2)O(2) levels . MnSOD-overexpressing cells show higher proliferation rates in complete medium , but in steroid-free medium MnSOD- P28222 cells are still capable of proliferation . MnSOD up-regulation decreases androgen receptor and prevents its nuclear translocation . MnSOD also induces up-regulation of Bcl-2 and prevents docetaxel- , etoposide- , or P01375 -induced cell death . Finally , MnSOD-overexpressing cells enhance growth of androgen-independent PC-3 cells but reduce growth of androgen-dependent cells . These results indicate that redox modulation caused by MnSOD overexpression explains most NE-like features , including morphological changes , NE marker expression , androgen independence , inhibition of apoptosis , and enhancement of cell growth . Many of these events can be associated with the androgen dependent-independent transition during prostate cancer progression .
