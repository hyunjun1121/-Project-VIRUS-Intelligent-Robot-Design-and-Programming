Discovering novel chemical inhibitors of human cyclophilin A : virtual screening , synthesis , and bioassay . P62937 ( CypA ) is a member of cyclophilins , a family of the highly homologous peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases ( PPIases ) , which can bind to cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) . CypA plays critical roles in various biological processes , including protein folding , assembly , transportation , regulation of neuron growth , and HIV replication . The discovery of CypA inhibitor is now of a great special interest in the treatment of immunological disorders . In this study , a series of novel small molecular CypA inhibitors have been discovered by using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay . The SPECS_1 database containing 85,000 small molecular compounds was searched by virtual screening against the crystal structure of human CypA . After SPR-based binding affinity assay , 15 compounds were found to show binding affinities to CypA at submicro-molar or micro-molar level ( compounds 1-15 ) . Seven compounds were selected as the starting point for the further structure modification in considering binding activity , synthesis difficulty , and structure similarity . We thus synthesized 40 new small molecular compounds ( 1-6 , 15 , 16a-q , 17a-d , and 18a-l ) , and four of which ( compounds 16b , 16h , 16k , and 18g ) showed high CypA PPIase inhibition activities with IC50s of 2.5-6.2 microM . Pharmacological assay indicated that these four compounds demonstrated somewhat inhibition activities against the proliferation of spleen cells .
