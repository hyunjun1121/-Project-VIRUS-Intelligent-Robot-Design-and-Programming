Growth inhibition in clonal subpopulations of a human epithelioid sarcoma cell line by retinoic acid and tumour necrosis factor alpha . Epithelioid sarcoma is a highly malignant soft tissue tumour that is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and irradiation . Since permanent cell lines of this tumour are extremely rare , in vitro data on compounds with significant antiproliferative effects are still lacking . Therefore , we investigated the effects of retinoic acid ( RA ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) on tumour cell proliferation of three different clonal subpopulations ( GRU-1A , GRU-1B , GRU-1C ) derived from the same human epithelioid sarcoma cell line , GRU-1 . In GRU-1A both RA ( P=0.01 ) and P01375 ( P=0.002 ) exhibited highly significant and dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects , which could further be increased by a combined application of both compounds ( P < 0.006 ) . GRU-1B proved to be sensitive to RA ( P=0.006 ) , whereas no response to P01375 was observed . GRU-1C was resistant to both RA and P01375 . The antiproliferative effect of P01375 was mediated by P01375 receptor 1( P19438 ) and correlated positively with both the number of P19438 per cell and receptor affinity . No correlation was detected between RA-induced growth inhibition and the expression pattern of the RA receptors ( RARs ) P10276 , P10826 , and P13631 . Plating efficiency , however , could exclusively be reduced by RA in GRU-1B , the only cell line expressing P10276 . Taken together , these data are the first showing significant antiproliferative effects in human epithelioid sarcoma by RA and P01375 . Whereas the P01375 response seems to depend on the expression of P19438 , no simple correlation could be found between RA sensitivity and the expression pattern of RARs .
