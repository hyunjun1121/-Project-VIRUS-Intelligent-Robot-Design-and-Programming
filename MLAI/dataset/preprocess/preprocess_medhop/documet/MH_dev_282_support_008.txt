The influence of mast cell mediators on migration of SW756 cervical carcinoma cells . The role of mast cell mediators on cervical cancer cell migration was assessed using an in vitro assay of scratch wound healing onto monolayers of HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma cells ( SW756 ) . Migration of SW756 cells was accelerated by co-culture with the mast cell line LAD2 . This effect was inhibited by the P35367 antagonist DB06691 and the cannabinoid agonists 2-arachidonylglycerol ( 2AG ) and Win 55,212-2 . Therefore , the specific effects of histamine and cannabinoids on SW756 migration and LAD2 activation were analyzed . DB11320 added to the in vitro assay of scratch wound healing either increased or inhibited SW756 migration rate by acting either on P35367 or Q9H3N8 , respectively . Cannabinoids acted on P21554 receptors to inhibit SW756 migration . Supernatants from SW756 cells stimulated LAD2 cell degranulation , which in turn was inhibited by cannabinoids acting via CB2 receptors . RT-PCR showed that SW756 expressed mRNA for P21554 , CB2 , P35367 , P25021 , and Q9H3N8 . On the other hand , LAD2 expressed mRNA for all four HRs and CB2 . The results suggest that mast cells could be contributing to cervical cancer cell invasion and spreading by the release of histamine and cannabinoids . Therefore , therapeutic modulation of specific mast cell mediators may be beneficial for cervical cancer treatment .
