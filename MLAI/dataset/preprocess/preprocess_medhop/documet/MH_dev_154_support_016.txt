DB00013 plasminogen activator activity is increased in the myocardium during coronary artery occlusion . We have previously demonstrated that collateral development takes place in a swine model of coronary artery occlusion . In this report we have examined the effect of coronary artery occlusion on urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator activity in the myocardium . DB00013 activity was increased four-fold in the ischemic heart compared to sham and unoperated controls . In contrast , the level of tissue plasminogen activator activity remained relatively constant . The increase in urokinase activity was associated with an upregulation of urokinase RNA levels and of the RNAs corresponding to the plasminogen activator inhibitors , P05121 I and II . DB00013 has been shown to be an important angiogenic protease both in vivo and in cultured cells . Its increase during collateral development suggests that urokinase may play a role in angiogenesis in the ischemic heart .
