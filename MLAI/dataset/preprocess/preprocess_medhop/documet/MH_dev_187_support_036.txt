Porcine carotid vascular effects of eletriptan ( UK-116,044 ) : a new P28222 /1D receptor agonist with anti-migraine activity . It has been suggested that opening of cephalic arteriovenous anastomoses may be involved in the headache phase of migraine . Indeed , a number of acutely acting anti-migraine drugs , including the ergot alkaloids and sumatriptan , constrict porcine carotid arteriovenous anastomoses . In this study , using pentobarbital anaesthetised pigs , we investigated the effects of eletriptan , a close structural analogue of sumatriptan , on the distribution of common carotid artery blood flow into arteriovenous anastomotic and nutrient ( capillary ) fractions . DB00216 ( 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 and 1000 microg kg(-1) , i.v. ) decreased the total carotid blood flow , exclusively by decreasing cephalic arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow ; nutrient blood flow , particularly to the ear , skin and fat , was significantly increased . The doses of eletriptan needed to reduce arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow and conductance by 50 % ( ED50 ) were , respectively , 117+/-21 microg kg(-1) ( 251+/-45 nmol kg(-1) ) and 184+/-42 microg kg(-1) ( 396+/-91 nmol kg(-1) ) ; the highest dose caused reductions of 84+/-3 % and 77+/-4 % , respectively . The eletriptan-induced changes in carotid haemodynamics were clearly attenuated by pretreating the pigs with the selective P28222 /1D receptor antagonist GR127935 ( 0.5 mg kg(-1) ) . On the basis of these results , we conclude that ( 1 ) the eletriptan-induced constriction of cephalic arteriovenous anastomoses as well as the arteriolar dilatation in head tissues is predominantly mediated by P28222 /1D receptors , and ( 2 ) eletriptan should be effective in aborting migraine headache . Clinical studies have already demonstrated its therapeutic action in migraine patients .
