A cyclophilin A inducible expressed in gonad of zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri . P62937 ( CypA ) , a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) , is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase ( PPIase ) which accelerates the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds , interacts with a variety of proteins and therefore regulates their activities . One CypA ( designated CfCypA ) cDNA was cloned from Chlamys farreri by expressed sequence tag ( EST ) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) techniques . The full-length cDNA of CfCypA consisted of 1,248 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA , a poly ( A ) tail , and an open reading frame ( ORF ) of 495 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 164 amino acids . The deduced amino acid sequence shared high similarity with CypA from the other species , indicating that CfCypA should be a new member of the CypA family . Quantitative real-time ( RT ) PCR was employed to assess the mRNA expression of CfCypA in various tissues and its temporal expression in haemocytes and gonad of scallops challenged with Vibrio anguillarum . The mRNA transcripts of CfCypA could be detected in all the examined tissues with highest expression level in gonad . After bacterial challenge , the expression level of CfCypA was almost unchanged in haemocytes , but up-regulated in gonad and increased to the peak ( 22.59-fold ; P < 0.05 ) at 4 h post-injection , and then dropped to the original level at 8 h post-injection . These results indicated that CfCypA was constitutive expressed in haemocytes , but could be induced in gonad , and perhaps played a critical role in response to the bacterial challenge in gonad .
