[ Association study of renin-angiotensin system genes and hemostasis system genes with ischemic stroke among Russians of Central Russia ] . The analysis of alleles and genotypes frequencies of 14 SNP in genes of rennin-angiotensin system ( REN , AGT , P30556 , P50052 , P30411 , P07550 ) and hemostasis system ( P02675 , F2 , P12259 , P08709 , P05106 , P05121 , P42898 ) , as well as P12821 insertion-deletion polymorphism in patients with stroke comparing to healthy controls matched by age , sex and ethnicity has been carried out . The genotyping procedure included the amplification of selected gene sequences following by hybridization of fluorescently labeled fragments with SNP-specific DNA probes . The analysis of allele frequencies of each gene separately revealed no statistically significant differences between groups of patients with stroke and healthy donors . Also the complex study has been performed to estimate the contribution of rennin-angiotensin system and hemostasis system genes to the genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke among Russians from Central Russia using method MDR ( Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction ) . The combination with increased risk for development of ischemic stroke was presented by complex genotype P02675 G/- x P12821 I/- x P42898 C/- x P05121 5G/5G ( p = 0.03 , OR = 2.4 , 95 % CI 1.1-5.3 ) , which frequency was statistically significant higher in patients with stroke compared to healthy control .
