DB00583 palmitoyltransferase 2 : New insights on the substrate specificity and implications for acylcarnitine profiling . Over the last years acylcarnitines have emerged as important biomarkers for the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation ( mFAO ) and branched-chain amino acid oxidation disorders assuming they reflect the potentially toxic acyl- DB01992 species , accumulating intramitochondrially upstream of the enzyme block . However , the origin of these intermediates still remains poorly understood . A possibility exists that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 ( P23786 ) , member of the carnitine shuttle , is involved in the intramitochondrial synthesis of acylcarnitines from accumulated acyl- DB01992 metabolites . To address this issue , the substrate specificity profile of P23786 was herein investigated . Saccharomyces cerevisiae homogenates expressing human P23786 were incubated with saturated and unsaturated P06681 -C26 acyl-CoAs and branched-chain amino acid oxidation intermediates . The produced acylcarnitines were quantified by P19957 -MS/MS . We show that P23786 is active with medium ( Q99618 -C12 ) and long-chain ( C14-C18 ) acyl- DB01992 esters , whereas virtually no activity was found with short- and very long-chain acyl-CoAs or with branched-chain amino acid oxidation intermediates . Trans-2-enoyl- DB01992 intermediates were also found to be poor substrates for P23786 . Inhibition studies performed revealed that trans-2-C16:1- DB01992 may act as a competitive inhibitor of P23786 ( K(i) of 18.8 microM ) . The results obtained clearly demonstrate that P23786 is able to reverse its physiological mechanism for medium and long-chain acyl-CoAs contributing to the abnormal acylcarnitines profiles characteristic of most mFAO disorders . The finding that trans-2-enoyl-CoAs are poorly handled by P23786 may explain the absence of trans-2-enoyl-carnitines in the profiles of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficient patients , the only defect where they accumulate , and the discrepancy between the clinical features of this and other long-chain mFAO disorders such as very long-chain acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenase deficiency .
