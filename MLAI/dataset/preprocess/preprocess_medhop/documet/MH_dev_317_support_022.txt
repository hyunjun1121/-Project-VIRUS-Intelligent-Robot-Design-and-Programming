Comparative modeling of the N-terminal domain of the 67kDa laminin-binding protein : implications for putative ribosomal function . P17931 /p40 ( P08865 ) precursor appears to be involved in two seemingly unrelated activities-cell adhesion and ribosomal biogenesis . Analysis of primary structure revealed a two-domain organization of the P08865 . The N-terminal portion of P18428 is similar to the S2 family of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins , while the C-terminus is unique for Metazoa and is involved in extraribosomal functions . To gain insight into putative ribosomal functions of P18428 we performed comparative modeling of the N-terminal domain using crystal structures of S2p from Thermus thermophilus . The P18428 model assumes an alpha-beta sandwich fold similar to that of S2 . Modeling revealed the loss of a significant portion of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) interaction domain , lack of conservation of many residues involved in interactions with rRNA , and a major shift in surface charge distribution ( compared to the S2 protein ) . The overall stability of the fold argues against a proposed transmembrane domain in the central part of the protein . Partial overlap in S2 and laminin-binding domains suggests that ribosomal and surface receptor functions would be mutually exclusive . The possible biological role of P08865 bifunctionality is discussed .
