High-throughput screening for kinase inhibitors . Following G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , protein kinases have become the second most important class of targets for drug discovery over the last 20 years . While only four kinase inhibitors have reached the market to date ( Fasudil for rho-dependent kinase , DB00877 for TOR , Gleevec for P11274 -Abl , and DB00317 for P00533 ) , many more are already in clinical development . A historical overview of kinase inhibitors was recently published by Cohen . [ 1 ] After the previous successes , protein kinases are now regarded as attractive , well-drugable targets , and the analysis of the human genome has yielded 518 protein kinases . [ 2 ] We can thus expect screening for protein kinase inhibitors to become even more important in the future . In this review we will focus on the early steps of drug discovery programs producing new lead compounds . We will guide the reader through efficient state-of-the-art assay development and high-throughput screening of large chemical libraries for protein kinase inhibitors .
