Absence of thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in human parathyroid and pituitary glands . Thyroid transcription factor-1 ( Q15669 -1 ) , a tissue-specific nuclear transcription factor involved in the embryogenesis and differentiation of human thyroid , lung and brain , has been recently identified in other rat tissues , including parafollicular C cells and parathyroid chief cells . Based on this distribution , a possible role for this factor in calcium homeostasis has been suggested . This study investigated the presence of Q15669 -1 transcripts and protein in human tissues expressing the calcium sensing receptor ( P41180 ) . Using a RT-PCR technique , complemented by Southern blot analysis , Q15669 -1 expression was detected in human C cells ( two medullary thyroid carcinomas ) , but not in normal and adenomatous ( four adenomas and three hyperplasia ) parathyroid , and normal and adenomatous ( six adenomas ) pituitary tissues . P41180 was expressed in all samples . The absence of expression was confirmed by Western blot . In contrast to previous studies in the rat , this study demonstrates the absence of Q15669 -1 transcripts in the human adult parathyroid and pituitary glands , although a role for this factor during the ontogeny of these organs can not be excluded .
