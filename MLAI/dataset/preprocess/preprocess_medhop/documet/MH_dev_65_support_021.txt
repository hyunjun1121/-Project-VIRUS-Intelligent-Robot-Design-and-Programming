A study of 36 unrelated cases with pure erythrocytosis revealed three new mutations in the erythropoietin receptor gene . Thirty-six unrelated cases with erythrocytosis of unknown origin were investigated . Exons 5-8 of the erythropoietin receptor gene ( P19235 ) , the von Hippel-Lindau gene , and the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 gene ( Q9GZT9 ) were screened by direct DNA sequencing . The O60674 mutation , O60674 ( Val617Phe ) , was screened by allele specific PCR . In this study , three new mutations of P19235 causing deletions in exon 8 were found : the first led directly to a stop codon [ g.5957_5958delTT ( p.Phe424X ) ] , the second to a stop codon after one residue [ g.5828_5829delCC ( p.Pro381GlnfsX1 ) ] and the third to a stop codon following a frameshift sequence of 23 residues [ g.5971delC ( p.Leu429TrpfsX23 ) ] . One patient had a previously reported P19235 mutation [ g.6146A > G ( p.Asn487Ser ) ] and another , a silent one ( g.5799G > A ) . All were heterozygotes . In addition , 2 patients were positive for O60674 ( Val617Phe ) , and 2 reported elsewhere , were mutated in the Q9GZT9 gene [ c.606delG ( p.Met202IlefsX71 ) .
