DB00328 ameliorates high glucose-induced proliferation and invasion via modulation of e-cadherin in pancreatic cancer cells . DB00328 , an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , has been shown to exert anticancer effects in a variety of cancers . However , the effect and mechanism of indometacin on high glucose ( HG ) -induced proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cells remain unclear . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that a large portion of pancreatic cancer ( PC ) patients suffer from either diabetes or HG which contributing PC progression . In this study , we report that indometacin down-regulated HG-induced proliferation and invasion via up-regulating P12830 but not P35354 in PC cells . Additionally , the P12830 transcriptional repressors , Snail and Slug , were also involved in the process . Furthermore , the proliferation and invasion of PC cells , incubated in HG medium and treated with indometacin were significantly increased when P12830 was knocked down ( Si-E-cad ) . Moreover , the protein levels of P08253 , P14780 , and P15692 were increased in PC cells transfected with Si-E-cad . Finally , the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in indometacin reversing HG-induced cell proliferation and invasion in PC cells . In conclusion , these results suggest that indometacin plays a key role in down-regulating HG-induced proliferation and invasion in PC cells . Our findings indicate that indometacin could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat PC patients who simultaneously suffer from diabetes or HG .
