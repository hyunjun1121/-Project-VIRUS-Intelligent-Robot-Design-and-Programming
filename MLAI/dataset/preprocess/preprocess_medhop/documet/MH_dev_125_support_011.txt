Large-scale association study for structural soundness and leg locomotion traits in the pig . BACKGROUND : Identification and culling of replacement gilts with poor skeletal conformation and feet and leg ( FL ) unsoundness is an approach used to reduce sow culling and mortality rates in breeding stock . Few candidate genes related to soundness traits have been identified in the pig . METHODS : In this study , 2066 commercial females were scored for 17 traits describing body conformation and FL structure , and were used for association analyses . Genotyping of 121 SNPs derived from 95 genes was implemented using Sequenom 's MassARRAY system . RESULTS : Based on the association results from single trait and principal components using mixed linear model analyses and false discovery rate testing , it was observed that P02649 , P34820 , P30988 , P08123 , P20849 , DKFZ , P35555 and VDBP were very highly significantly ( P < 0.001 ) associated with body conformation traits . The genes P09917 , P34820 , P30988 , O00300 , P30559 and Q9UBV4 were very highly significantly ( P < 0.001 ) associated with FL structures , and P02649 , P30988 , P08123 , P30968 , Q14623 , P42898 and Q9UBV4 were highly significantly ( P < 0.01 ) associated with overall leg action . Strong linkage disequilibrium between P30988 and P08123 on SSC9 was detected , and haplotype -ACGACC- was highly significantly ( P < 0.01 ) associated with overall leg action and several important FL soundness traits . CONCLUSION : The present findings provide a comprehensive list of candidate genes for further use in fine mapping and biological functional analyses .
