Embryo transfer induces a subclinical endometritis in recipient mares which can be prevented by treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs . We tested the hypothesis that subclinical endometritis occurs after embryo transfer ( ET ) in the horse . Recipient mares were treated with meclofenamic acid ( M ) or flunixin meglumin ( F ) after ET or were left untreated ( n=9 per group ) . Embryos were re-collected 4 days after transfer . Endometrial biopsies were taken for histology and analysis of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) by immunohistochemistry and for PCR . Bacteriological swabs were collected from the uterus and lavage fluid of donor and recipient mares . Progesterone and prostaglandin F(2alpha) release was analysed in recipient mares after ET . Four days after ET , four embryos were recovered from group M and three from group F and untreated mares , each . The number of polymorph nuclear neutrophils was reduced in treated mares ( p < 0.05 ) . Expression of mRNA for inflammatory cytokines did not differ between groups . In group M , expression of endometrial prostaglandin-E-synthase was higher than in group F ( p < 0.05 ) . Three out of nine control mares underwent preterm luteolysis ( p < 0.05 vs. treatment groups ) , prostaglandin release ( p < 0.05 ) and the number of P35354 positive cells ( p < 0.01 ) were significantly higher than in treated mares . Only few bacteriological swabs were positive . In conclusion , treatment of embryo recipient mares with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs inhibits the inflammatory response of the endometrium after ET . DB00939 may have advantages in comparison to flunixin meglumin due to a different influence on prostaglandin synthesis that may not result in inhibition of embryonic mobility .
