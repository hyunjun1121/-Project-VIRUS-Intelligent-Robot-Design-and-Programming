DB01076 stimulates the production of osteoprotegerin by human osteoblasts . Recently , P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) , potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis , have been linked to protective effects on bone metabolism . Because of their widespread use , prevention of bone loss and fractures would be a desirable side effect . However , the mechanisms how statins may affect bone metabolism are poorly defined . Here , we evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on osteoblastic production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand ( O14788 ) and osteoprotegerin ( O00300 ) , cytokines that are essential for osteoclast cell biology . While O14788 enhances osteoclast formation and activation , thereby , promoting bone loss , O00300 acts as a soluble decoy receptor and antagonizes the effects of O14788 . In primary human osteoblasts ( hOB ) , atorvastatin increased O00300 mRNA levels and protein secretion by hOB by up to three fold in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 10(-6) M ( P < 0.001 ) . Time course experiments indicated a time-dependent stimulatory effect of atorvastatin on O00300 mRNA levels after 24 h and on O00300 protein secretion after 48-72 h ( P < 0.001 ) . Treatment of hOB with substrates of cholesterol biosynthesis that are downstream of the P04035 reaction ( mevalonate , geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ) reversed atorvastatin-induced enhancement of O00300 production . Of note , atorvastatin abrogated the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on O00300 production . Treatment of hOB with atorvastatin enhanced the expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers , alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin . In summary , our data suggest that atorvastatin enhances osteoblastic differentiation and production of O00300 . This may contribute to the bone-sparing effects of statins .
