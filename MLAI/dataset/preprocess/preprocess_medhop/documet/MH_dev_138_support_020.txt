The cardiac L-type calcium channel distal carboxy terminus autoinhibition is regulated by calcium . The L-type calcium channel ( LTCC ) provides trigger Ca(2+) for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-release , and LTCC function is influenced by interacting proteins including the LTCC distal COOH terminus ( P40126 ) and calmodulin . P40126 is proteolytically cleaved and reassociates with the LTCC complex to regulate calcium channel function . P40126 reduces LTCC barium current ( I(Ba,L) ) in reconstituted channel complexes , yet the contribution of P40126 to LTCC Ca(2+) current ( I(Ca,L) ) in cardiomyocyte systems is unexplored . This study tests the hypothesis that P40126 attenuates cardiomyocyte I(Ca,L) . We measured LTCC current and Ca(2+) transients with P40126 coexpressed in murine cardiomyocytes . We also heterologously coexpressed P40126 and Ca(V)1.2 constructs with truncations corresponding to the predicted proteolytic cleavage site , Ca(V)1.2Δ1801 , and a shorter deletion corresponding to well-studied construct , Ca(V)1.2Δ1733 . P40126 inhibited I(Ba,L) in cardiomyocytes , and in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells expressing Ca(V)1.2Δ1801 and Ca(V)1.2Δ1733 . Ca(2+)- P62158 relieved P40126 block in cardiomyocytes and P29320 cells . The selective block of I(Ba,L) combined with Ca(2+)- P62158 effects suggested that P40126 -mediated blockade may be relieved under conditions of elevated Ca(2+) . We therefore tested the hypothesis that P40126 block is dynamic , increasing under relatively low Ca(2+) , and show that P40126 reduced diastolic Ca(2+) at low stimulation frequencies but spared high frequency Ca(2+) entry . P40126 reduction of diastolic Ca(2+) and relief of block at high pacing frequencies and under conditions of supraphysiological bath Ca(2+) suggests that a physiological function of P40126 is to increase the dynamic range of Ca(2+) transients in response to elevated pacing frequencies . Our data motivate the new hypothesis that P40126 is a native reverse use-dependent inhibitor of LTCC current .
