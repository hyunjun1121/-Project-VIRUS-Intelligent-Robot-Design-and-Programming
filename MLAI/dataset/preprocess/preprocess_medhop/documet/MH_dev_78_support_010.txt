TLR-2-mediated cytokine and chemokine secretion in human keratinocytes . The human epidermis provides a first line of defense against exogenous pathogens . Resistance to bacterial skin infections , e.g. with Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) , is based on the function of intact innate immune mechanisms in the epidermis , mainly provided by keratinocytes . They establish the local cytokine and chemokine milieu which is necessary for attracting other cells participating in an immune response . Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -2 recognizes components of S. aureus and is known to be expressed on keratinocytes . The aim of this study was to investigate TLR-2-mediated chemokine and cytokine secretion on human primary keratinocytes ( HPKs ) both on mRNA and on protein level . As there is no selective TLR-2 ligand known so far , we chose Pam3Cys that acts via TLR-2/TLR-1 heterodimers , lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) that acts via TLR-2/TLR-6 and peptidoglycan ( Q9UQ90 ) which acts via TLR-2 and Nod . Pam3Cys stimulation yielded in an enhanced secretion of P78556 , P13500 , P14780 and P10145 in HPK , whereas stimulation with Q9UQ90 or P01374 showed no or solely slight effects . Our findings show evidence for a functional TLR-2/TLR-1 signalling profile in HPKs upon stimulation with Pam3Cys contributing to the defense against bacterial skin infections .
