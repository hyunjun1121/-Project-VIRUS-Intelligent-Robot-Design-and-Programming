DB09559 , a fully human IgG1 mAb directed against the P00533 for the potential treatment of cancer . DB09559 ( DB05774 ) , under development by ImClone Systems in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb , is a fully human IgG1 mAb targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , for the potential intravenous treatment of cancer , in particular NSCLC . In vitro studies demonstrate that necitumumab inhibits downstream targets in the P00533 pathway ( eg , MAPK ) , which are important for cellular proliferation , differentiation , invasion and metastasis . Furthermore , because necitumumab is an IgG1 construct , it has the potential to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells . Preclinical studies indicated that the antitumor activity of necitumumab is either comparable with or superior to that of ImClone 's chimeric anti- P00533 mAb cetuximab . In a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies , necitumumab displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior . The toxicity profile of necitumumab is acceptable , with skin toxicity being the most frequently reported adverse event in the phase I and II clinical trials conducted to date . Preliminary data from a phase II clinical trial of necitumumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced colon cancer are promising . Success in the ongoing phase III clinical trials in patients with advanced NSCLC would lead to necitumumab becoming a valuable addition to future therapeutic strategies in oncology .
