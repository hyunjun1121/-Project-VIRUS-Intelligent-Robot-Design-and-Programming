Compensatory increases in Her-2/neu activation in response to P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibition in colon cancer cell lines . BACKGROUND : Tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family have become promising targets for anti-neoplastic drugs , but mechanisms of resistance are incompletely understood . To investigate such pathways , we applied a small-molecule , selective P00533 inhibitor , DB00530 , to three well-characterized colon cancer cell lines and studied the alterations of expression and activation of receptors in the erbB family . METHODS : MTT assays were performed to determine the IC(50)s of GEO , FET , and HCT 116 human colorectal cancer cell lines treated with DB00530 . Plated cells were then exposed to either DB01093 control or 7 microm of DB00530 for treatment durations of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 28 , and 56 days . Cell lysates were evaluated by Western blotting , evaluating both total and phosphorylated levels of P00533 , Her-2/neu , and erbB-3 . RESULTS : IC(50) values for GEO , FET , and HCT 116 cell lines exposed to DB00530 were 12.0 , 16.0 , and greater than 100 microm , respectively . In all treated cell lines , DB00530 diminished P00533 activation but did not affect total expression compared with controls . In contrast , Her-2/neu activation was increased in all cell lines . These changes in P00533 and Her-2/neu were identified within 24 h but peaked later in the treatment cycle . ErbB-3 expression and activation did not follow a consistent pattern between cell lines . CONCLUSIONS : Inhibition of P00533 led to increased activation of Her-2/neu . This result suggests a possible mechanism by which cells might escape the proapoptotic signals resulting from P00533 blockade . Our findings suggest concurrent inhibition of multiple members of the erbB family may yield stronger apoptotic responses than single receptor blockade alone .
