Normal and perturbed endothelial cells from canine femoral arteries and femoral veins exhibit heterogeneity in hemostatic properties and growth characteristics . BACKGROUND : We sought to examine the heterogeneity of endothelial cells from the same anatomic site but different vascular systems and described P04275 ( P04275 ) release and morphological change in response to injury-associated factor in femoral vessels from canine in vitro . METHODS : Levels of hemostatic factors ( P04275 , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1( P05121 ) , antithrombin III ( P01008 ) , in tissue sections and cultured endothelial cells of canine femoral arteries and canine femoral veins were compared by the immunohistochemistry technique . In addition to comparing cell growth density and cell protein contents , cultured femoral arterial endothelial cells ( FAECs ) and cultured femoral venous endothelial cells ( FVECs ) were incubated with a series concentration of basic fibroblast factor ( P09038 ) ( 1 , 10 , 100 ng/ml ) for up to 48 hours to test the amount of P04275 secretion and morphological change . RESULTS : Both in tissue sections and cultured cells , the levels of P04275 are higher in FVECs than in FAECs . We were unable to differentiate the level of P05121 and P01008 difference between FAECs and FVECs. P09038 ( 10 ng/ml ) significantly increased P04275 secretion from cultured FAECs but not from FVECs . The size of cultured FAECs is smaller than of FVECs ; however , FAECs have higher amounts of protein contents than FVECs . CONCLUSIONS : These comparative studies provide evidence indicating that the characteristics of FVECs differ from those of FAECs . These differences may be indicated heterogeneity with either inherited or acquired thrombotic disease .
