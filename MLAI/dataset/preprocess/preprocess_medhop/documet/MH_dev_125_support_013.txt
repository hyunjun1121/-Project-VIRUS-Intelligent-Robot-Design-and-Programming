DB01017 accelerates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha degradation and inhibits hypoxia-induced neovasculogenesis through prolyl hydroxylase , von Hippel-Lindau-dependent pathway . Hypoxia-mediated stress responses are important in tumor progression , especially when tumor growth causes the tumor to become deprived of its blood supply . The oxygen-labile transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF-1α ) plays a critical role in regulating hypoxia stress-related gene expression and is considered a novel therapeutic target . Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were exposed to minocycline , followed by incubation at hypoxic condition for 3-6 h . Here , we show that minocycline , a second-generation tetracycline , can induce HIF-1α proteasomal degradation under hypoxia by increasing the expression prolyl hydroxylase-2 and HIF-1α/von Hippel-Lindau protein interaction , thereby overcoming hypoxia-induced HIF-1α stabilization . Neither repression of hypoxia-induced phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway nor inhibition of Hsp90 was required for minocycline-induced HIF-1α degradation . The HIF-1α degradation-enhancing effect of minocycline was evident in both cancerous and primary cells . DB01017 -pretreated , hypoxia-conditioned cells showed a clear reduction in hypoxia response element reporter expression and amelioration of vascular endothelial growth factor C/D ( P49767 /D ) , matrix metalloproteinase 2 , and glucose transporter 1 expression . By decreasing P15692 secretion of cancerous cells , minocycline could suppress endothelial cell neovasculogenesis . These findings suggest a novel application of minocycline in the treatment of tumor angiogenesis as well as hypoxia-related diseases .
