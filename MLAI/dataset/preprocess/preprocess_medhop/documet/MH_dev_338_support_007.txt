P01308 -like growth factor binding protein-3 interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor α1 and modulates transcription of thyroid hormone responsive gene . OBJECTIVE : To study the interaction between insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) and thyroid hormone receptor α1 ( TRα1 ) and the modulatory effect of P17936 on transcription of the thyroid hormone responsive gene . METHODS : The interaction between P17936 and TRα1 was detected with glutathione-S-transferase pull-down method , co-immunoprecipitation , fluorescence resonance energy transfer test . The cellular distribution of these two proteins was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . The effect of P17936 on the growth hormone promoter activity stimulated by triiodothyronine ( DB00279 ) was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay . RESULTS : P17936 interacted with TRα1 both in vivo and in vitro . P17936 and TRα1 were shown to co-localize in the nucleus of P29320 -293 cells . The overexpressed P17936 inhibited the growth hormone promoter activity stimulated by DB00279 ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS : P17936 interacts with TRα1 and inhibits DB00279 responsive gene transcription . This finding further confirms the insulin-like growth factor-independent role of P17936 in the nucleus .
