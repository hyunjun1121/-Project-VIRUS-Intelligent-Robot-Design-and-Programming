Invasive Lobular Carcinomas Do Not Express Basal Cytokeratin Markers CK5/6 , CK14 and CK17 . The expression of basal cytokeratin markers CK5/6 in breast carcinomas has been associated with high histological grade and poor clinical outcome . A previous study has shown that CK5/6 can be detected in up to 17 % of invasive lobular carcinomas ( Q9Y4X3 ) . Here we study the expression of three basal cytokeratin markers ( CK5/6 , CK14 , and CK17 ) in 53 Q9Y4X3 cases diagnosed by histology and lack of P12830 expression . Among them , 42 were classic lobular carcinomas , 6 were tubular-lobular carcinoma , and 5 were pleomorphic lobular carcinomas . There was no significant difference among these three groups in patients ' age , tumor size , uni- and multi-focality , expression of ER and PR , lymphovascular invasion , perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis . The only statistically different factor was P04626 over-expression , which was observed only in pleomorphic Q9Y4X3 ( P = 0.0073 ) . None of the 53 cases expressed CK5/6 , CK14 or CK17 ; and 51/53 cases expressed luminal markers CK8 and CK18 , and the two negative cases were both classic lobular carcinoma , with positivity for ER and PR . In conclusion , all 53 cases of Q9Y4X3 failed to show expression by any of the three basal CK markers , suggesting that very few Q9Y4X3 will demonstrate a basal phenotype when assessed by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . More studies are needed to investigate molecular classification in lobular carcinoma of the breast .
