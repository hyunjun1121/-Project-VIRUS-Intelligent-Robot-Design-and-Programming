The potential role of PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) in the treatment of multiple myeloma . INTRODUCTION : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains an incurable malignancy indicating a need for continued investigation of novel therapies . Recent studies have highlighted the role of cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK ) in the pathogenesis of MM . PD0332991 ( DB09073 ) is an orally bioavailable , highly selective inhibitor of the P11802 /6-cyclin complex and downstream retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) activation pathway that induces cell cycle arrest in the P55008 phase . AREAS COVERED : In this review , the authors summarize the role of the P11802 /6 signaling pathway in MM . They also summarize the development of PD0332991 as a specific inhibitor of P11802 /6 , and the reported preclinical and clinical data supporting the potential role of PD0332991 in MM . EXPERT OPINION : While PD0332991 is essentially cytostatic , inducing prolonged P55008 arrest , it enhances the cytotoxic effect of other agents effective in MM , including bortezomib and lenalidomide , as confirmed in early phase clinical trials . However , with a plethora of other drugs of different classes being tested in MM , further development of PD0332991 will depend on defining the most efficacious combination with least toxicity . An unexplored opportunity remains the potential protective effect of PD0332991 against lytic bone lesions of MM . The next few years are likely to better define the place of PD0332991 in the treatment of MM .
