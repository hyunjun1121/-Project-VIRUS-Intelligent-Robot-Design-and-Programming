Activation of tumor-promoting type 2 macrophages by P00533 -targeting antibody cetuximab . PURPOSE : In a recent randomized phase III clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer patients , the addition of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) cetuximab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased progression-free survival , in particular for patients with the high-affinity FcγRIIIA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : The presence of natural killer ( NK ) cells and type 2 ( M2 ) macrophages in colorectal cancer was determined by immunohistochemistry , using antibodies to lineage-specific markers O76036 and P34810 with Q86VB7 , respectively . Influence of tumor-bound cetuximab on M2 macrophages was carried out in vitro with P00533 -expressing tumor cells and short-term differentiated monocytes from blood donors , who were typed for the FcγRIIIA polymorphism ( CD16 ) . RESULTS : Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by NK cells is generally proposed as one of the antitumor mechanisms of mAbs . We found that Q86VB7 -positive M2 macrophages are much more abundant in colorectal carcinomas . In vitro analysis of M2 macrophages revealed high levels of Fc-gamma receptors ( FcγR ) and Q9NZQ7 and production of P22301 and P15692 but not IL-12 . These anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting mediators were released upon coculture with P00533 -positive tumor cells loaded with low concentrations of cetuximab . Macrophage activation depended on P00533 expression on the tumor cells , FcγRs , target specificity of the mAb and mobility of antibody complexes . Cetuximab-induced macrophage responses were more pronounced for P08637 158- DB00161 ( high-affinity ) carriers . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that tumor-promoting M2 macrophages are activated by the therapeutic mAb cetuximab in the local tumor microenvironment and argue that this immune mechanism should be taken into account for the application of therapeutic antibodies .
