Response to DB08875 in patients with P07949 fusion-positive lung adenocarcinomas . The discovery of P07949 fusions in lung cancers has uncovered a new therapeutic target for patients whose tumors harbor these changes . In an unselected population of non-small cell lung carcinomas ( NSCLCs ) , P07949 fusions are present in 1 % to 2 % of cases . This incidence increases substantially , however , in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinomas that lack other known driver oncogenes . Although preclinical data provide experimental support for the use of P07949 inhibitors in the treatment of P07949 fusion-positive tumors , clinical data on response are lacking . We report preliminary data for the first three patients treated with the P07949 inhibitor cabozantinib on a prospective phase II trial for patients with P07949 fusion-positive NSCLCs ( NCT01639508 ) . Confirmed partial responses were observed in 2 patients , including one harboring a novel Q9UPN9 - P07949 fusion . A third patient with a P33176 - P07949 fusion has had prolonged stable disease approaching 8 months ( 31 weeks ) . All three patients remain progression-free on treatment .
