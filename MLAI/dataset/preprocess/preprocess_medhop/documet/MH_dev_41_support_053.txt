[ A colorimetric method of O14777 toxin hemolysis test for diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ] . The purpose of the study is to establish a colorimetric method of O14777 toxin hemolysis test for diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) . RBCs from normal persons and patients with PNH and non-PNH anemia were treated with O14777 toxin secreted by Aeromonas hydrophila J-1 strain and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured to quantitate the extent of hemolysis . The results demonstrated that the RBCs from PNH patients showed resistance to the toxin hemolysis , which was in accord with the percentages of P13987 (-) cells , while the RBCs from normal persons and non-PNH anemic patients were nearly totally lysed . It is concluded that the method can be considered as a simple , specific and reliable method for the diagnosis of PNH .
