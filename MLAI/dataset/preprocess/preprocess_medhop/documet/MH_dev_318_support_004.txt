[ Pharma-clinics. The drug of the month. Celecoxib ( DB00482 ) ] . Celecoxib ( DB00482 , Pharmacia ) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the P35354 isoform of cyclooxygenase which is used as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) . Its current indications are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . The usual recommended daily dosage of celecoxib is 200 mg ( in one or two intakes per day ) , to be increased up to 400 mg ( two intakes per day ) if necessary . Its clinical efficacy seems to be similar to that of other NSAIDs . However , its safety profile , especially gastro-intestinal tolerance and perhaps renal safety , is much better because of the P35354 selectivity .
