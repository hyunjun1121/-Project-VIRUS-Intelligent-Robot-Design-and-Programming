Effects of antihistamines on the function of human α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors . Effects of the histamine H₁ receptor ( P35367 ) antagonists ( antihistamines ) , promethazine ( PMZ ) , orphenadrine ( ORP ) , chlorpheniramine ( CLP ) , DB06691 ( PYR ) , diphenhydramine ( DPH ) , citerizine ( CTZ ) , and triprolidine ( TRP ) on the functional properties of the cloned α7 subunit of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes were investigated . Antihistamines inhibited the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the order PYR > CLP > TRP > PMZ > ORP≥DPH≥CTZ . Among the antihistamines , PYR showed the highest reversible inhibition of acetylcholine ( 100 µM ) -induced responses with IC₅₀ of 6.2 µM . PYR-induced inhibition was independent of the membrane potential and could not be reversed by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine . Specific binding of [ ¹²⁵I ] α-bungarotoxin , a selective antagonist for α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , was not changed in the presence of PYR suggesting a non-competitive inhibition of nicotinic receptors . In line with functional experiments , docking studies indicated that PYR can potentially bind allosterically with the α7 transmembrane domain . Our results indicate that the H₂-H₄ receptor antagonists tested in this study ( 10 µM ) showed negligible inhibition of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors . On the other hand , H₁ receptor antagonists inhibited the function of human α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , with varying potencies . These results emphasize the importance of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for future pharmacological/toxicological profiling .
