Clinical outcome , role of P15056 (V600E) , and molecular pathways in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma : is it an indolent cancer or an early stage of papillary thyroid cancer ? Most human thyroid cancers are differentiated papillary carcinomas ( PTC ) . Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas ( PTMC ) are tumors that measure 1 cm or less . This class of small tumors has proven to be a very common clinical entity in endocrine diseases . PTMC may be present in 30-40 % of human autopsies and is often identified incidentally in a thyroid removed for benign clinical nodules . Although PTMC usually has an excellent long-term prognosis , it can metastasize to neck lymph nodes ; however deaths related to this type of thyroid tumor are very rare . Few data exist on molecular pathways that play a role in PTMC development ; however , two molecules have been shown to be associated with aggressive PTMC . P26447 ( calcium-binding protein ) , which plays a role in angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling , and tumor microenvironment , is over-expressed in metastatic PTMC . In addition , the P15056 (V600E) mutation , the most common genetic alteration in PTC , is present in many PTMC with extra thyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis . Importantly , recently developed selective [ e.g. , PLX4720 , PLX4032 ( DB08881 , also called RG7204 ) ] or non-selective ( e.g. , DB00398 ) inhibitors of P15056 (V600E) may be an effective treatment for patients with P15056 (V600E)-expressing PTMCs with aggressive clinical-pathologic features . Here , we summarize the clinical outcome , cancer genetics , and molecular mechanisms of PTMC .
