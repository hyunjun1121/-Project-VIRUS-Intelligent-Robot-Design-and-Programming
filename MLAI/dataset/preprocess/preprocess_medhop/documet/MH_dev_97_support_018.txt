The proto-oncoprotein O95365 interacts with O95983 to recruit the Mi-2/NuRD-HDAC complex and Q6W2J9 and to silence p21WAF/ P38936 by DNA methylation . The tumour-suppressor gene P38936 ( encoding p21Waf/Cip1 ) is thought to be epigenetically repressed in cancer cells . O95365 ( O95365 ) is a proto-oncogenic transcription factor repressing the alternative reading frame and p21WAF/ P38936 genes of the p53 pathway . O95365 interacts directly with O95983 ( methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 ) in the nucleus . We demonstrated that O95365 binds both non-methylated and methylated DNA and that O95983 is recruited to the P38936 promoter through its interaction with O95365 , where it enhances transcriptional repression by O95365 . O95365 also interacts with the co-repressors nuclear receptor corepressor ( NCoR ) , silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors ( Q9Y618 ) and Q6W2J9 ( Q6W2J9 ) to repress transcription . O95983 regulates a molecular interaction between the co-repressor and O95365 . O95983 decreases the interaction between O95365 and NCoR/ Q9Y618 but increases the interaction between O95365 and Q6W2J9 . Because O95983 is a subunit of the Mi-2 autoantigen ( Mi-2 ) /nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase ( NuRD ) -HDAC complex , O95365 recruits the Mi-2/NuRD-HDAC complex via O95983 . Q6W2J9 interacts with the Mi-2/NuRD-HDAC complex , DNMTs and P59665 . O95983 and Q6W2J9 play a significant role in the recruitment of the Mi-2/NuRD-HDAC complex- and the NuRD complex-associated proteins , DNMTs and HP . By recruiting DNMTs and P59665 , Mi-2/NuRD-HDAC complex appears to play key roles in epigenetic repression of P38936 by DNA methylation .
