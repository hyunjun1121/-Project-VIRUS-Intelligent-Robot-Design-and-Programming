Differential regulation of DB01221 receptor function by Q99497 and Q9BXM7 . Dysfunction of P60484 -induced kinase 1 ( Q9BXM7 ) or Q99497 promotes neuronal death and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease , but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear . Given the roles of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ( NMDAr ) -mediated neurotoxicity in various brain disorders including cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases , we investigated the effects of Q9BXM7 and Q99497 on NMDAr function . Using protein overexpression and knockdown approaches , we showed that Q9BXM7 increased NMDAr-mediated whole-cell currents by enhancing the function of Q12879 -containing NMDAr subtype ( NR2ACNR ) . However , Q99497 decreased NMDAr-mediated currents , which was mediated through the inhibition of both NR2ACNR and Q13224 -containing NMDAr subtype ( NR2BCNR ) . We revealed that the knockdown of Q99497 enhanced P60484 expression , which not only potentiated NR2BCNR function but also increased Q9BXM7 expression that led to NR2ACNR potentiation . These results indicate that NMDAr function is differentially regulated by Q99497 -dependent signal pathways Q99497 / P60484 /NR2BCNR and Q99497 / P60484 / Q9BXM7 /NR2ACNR . Our results further showed that the suppression of Q99497 , while promoted DB01221 -induced neuronal death through the overactivation of P60484 /NR2BCNR-dependent cell death pathway , induced a neuroprotective effect to counteract Q99497 dysfunction-mediated neuronal death signaling through activating P60484 / Q9BXM7 /NR2ACNR cell survival-promoting pathway . Thus , Q9BXM7 acts with Q99497 in a common pathway to regulate NMDAr-mediated neuronal death . This study suggests that the Q99497 / P60484 /NR2BCNR and Q99497 / P60484 / Q9BXM7 /NR2ACNR pathways may represent potential therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotection strategy in the treatment of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson 's disease .
