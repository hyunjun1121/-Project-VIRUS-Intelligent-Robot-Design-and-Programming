DB06016 ( RGH-188 ) , a potent D3/D2 dopamine receptor partial agonist , binds to dopamine D3 receptors in vivo and shows antipsychotic-like and procognitive effects in rodents . We investigated the in vivo effects of orally administered cariprazine ( RGH-188 ; trans-N-{4-[2-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl]-cyclohexyl}-N',N'-dimethyl-urea ) , a D(3)/ P14416 partial agonist with âˆ¼10-fold preference for the D(3) receptor . Oral bioavailability of cariprazine at a dose of 1mg/kg in rats was 52 % with peak plasma concentrations of 91ng/mL . DB06016 10mg/kg had good blood-brain barrier penetration , with a brain/plasma AUC ratio of 7.6:1 . In rats , cariprazine showed dose-dependent in vivo displacement of [ (3)H ] (+)-PHNO , a dopamine D(3) receptor-preferring radiotracer , in the D(3) receptor-rich region of cerebellar lobules 9 and 10 . Its potent inhibition of apomorphine-induced climbing in mice ( ED(50)=0.27mg/kg ) was sustained for 8h . DB06016 blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity ( ED(50)=0.12mg/kg ) and conditioned avoidance response ( CAR ) ( ED(50)=0.84mg/kg ) in rats , and inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of the noncompetitive DB01221 antagonists MK-801 ( ED(50)=0.049mg/kg ) and phencyclidine ( ED(50)=0.09mg/kg ) in mice and rats , respectively . It reduced novelty-induced motor activity of mice ( ED(50)=0.11mg/kg ) and rats ( ED(50)=0.18mg/kg ) with a maximal effect of 70 % in both species . DB06016 produced no catalepsy in rats at up to 100-fold dose of its CAR inhibitory ED(50) value . DB06016 0.02-0.08mg/kg significantly improved the learning performance of scopolamine-treated rats in a water-labyrinth learning paradigm . Though risperidone , olanzapine , and aripiprazole showed antipsychotic-like activity in many of these assays , they were less active against phencyclidine and more cataleptogenic than cariprazine , and had no significant effect in the learning task . The distinct in vivo profile of cariprazine may be due to its higher affinity and in vivo binding to D(3) receptors versus currently marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics .
