Proliferation of endothelial cell on polytetrafluoroethylene vascular graft materials carried P15692 gene plasmid . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) gene plasmid carried by polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) vascular graft materials could transfect endothelial cells ( ECs ) and promote their growth . METHODS : PTFE vascular graft materials carried with pCDI-hVEGF(121) , pCDI or pEGFP were incubated in DB03754 -buffer solution and the values of optical density of 260 nm at different time were plotted , then the DNA controlled release curve was made . ECs derived from human umbilical vein were seeded on the pCDI-hVEGF(121)/pCDI/pEGFP-PTFE materials or tissue culture plates , ECs numbers were counted and P15692 protein concentrations at different time were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay method . Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression in ECs on pEGFP-PTFE materials was examined with fluorescence microscopy . RESULTS : The controlled release curve showed that the gene released from PTFE materials was rapid within 8 h , then slowed down and that the gene released continuously even after 72 h . At 24 , 72 and 120 h , ECs number and proliferation rate of pCDI-hVEGF(121)-PTFE materials were higher than those of pCDI or pEGFP-PTFE materials ( P < 0.05 ) . P15692 protein concentration of pCDI-hVEGF(121)-PTFE materials was higher than that of pCDI or pEGFP-PTFE materials at 6 , 24 , 72 and 120 h ( P < 0.01 ) . GFP expression in ECs on the pEGFP-PTFE materials could be detected by fluorescence microscopy . CONCLUSION : PTFE graft can be used as a carrier of P15692 gene plasmid , P15692 gene carried by PTFE can transfect ECs and promote ECs growth .
