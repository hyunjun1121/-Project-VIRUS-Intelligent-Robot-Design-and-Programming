Adenoviral expression of a urokinase receptor-targeted protease inhibitor inhibits neointima formation in murine and human blood vessels . BACKGROUND : Smooth muscle cell migration , in addition to proliferation , contributes to a large extent to the neointima formed in humans after balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery . P00747 activator/plasmin-mediated proteolysis is an important mediator of this smooth muscle cell migration . Here , we report the construction of a novel hybrid protein designed to inhibit the activity of cell surface-bound plasmin , which can not be inhibited by its natural inhibitors , such as alpha(2)-antiplasmin . This hybrid protein , consisting of the receptor-binding amino-terminal fragment of uPA ( P39905 ) , linked to the potent protease inhibitor bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor ( DB06692 ) , can inhibit plasmin activity at the cell surface . METHODS AND RESULTS : The effect of adenovirus-mediated P39905 . DB06692 expression on neointima formation was tested in human saphenous vein organ cultures . Infection of human saphenous vein segments with Ad.CMV. P39905 . DB06692 ( 5x10(9) pfu/mL ) resulted in 87.5+/-3.8 % ( mean+/-SEM , n=10 ) inhibition of neointima formation after 5 weeks , whereas Ad.CMV. P39905 or Ad.CMV. DB06692 virus had only minimal or no effect on neointima formation . The efficacy of P39905 . DB06692 in vivo was demonstrated in a murine model for neointima formation . Neointima formation in the femoral artery of mice , induced by placement of a polyethylene cuff , was strongly inhibited ( 93.9+/-2 % ) after infection with Ad.CMV.mATF. DB06692 , a variant of P39905 . DB06692 able to bind specifically to murine uPA receptor ; Ad.CMV.mATF and Ad.CMV. DB06692 had no significant effect . CONCLUSIONS : These data provide evidence that adenoviral transfer of a hybrid protein that binds selectively to the uPA receptor and inhibits plasmin activity directly on the cell surface is a powerful approach to inhibiting neointima formation and restenosis .
