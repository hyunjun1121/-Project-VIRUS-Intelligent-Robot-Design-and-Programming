Sulfonylureas inhibit cytokine-induced eosinophil survival and activation . Eosinophils play a key role in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic inflammatory diseases . We have previously shown that treatment of eosinophils with lidocaine preferentially inhibits P05113 -induced survival . This inhibition can not be overcome by increasing concentrations of P05113 and is not due to the blocking of Na+ channels by lidocaine . Here we report that one class of K+ channel blockers , the sulfonylureas , inhibits eosinophil survival in a manner similar to lidocaine . The sulfonylurea glyburide inhibits eosinophil survival even at high concentrations of P05113 . In contrast , increasing concentrations of P08700 or granulocyte-macrophage P04141 overcome glyburide inhibition . Glyburide also blocks cytokine-induced eosinophil superoxide production . Similar results were seen with the sulfonylureas tolbutamide and glipizide . Interestingly , the effects of glyburide are not antagonized by the DB00171 -sensitive K+ channel openers cromakalim , pinacidil , or diazoxide . Although Scatchard analysis of [3H]glyburide binding to eosinophil membranes indicated that the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor ( Q09428 ) is not present on eosinophils , human eosinophils do express mRNA homologous to the sulfonylurea receptor family , in keeping with the presence of a sulfonylurea receptor . Finally , coculture of eosinophils with combinations of glyburide , lidocaine , and dexamethasone resulted in synergistic inhibition of cytokine-mediated eosinophil survival and superoxide production . These results have intriguing clinical implications for the treatment of eosinophil-associated diseases .
