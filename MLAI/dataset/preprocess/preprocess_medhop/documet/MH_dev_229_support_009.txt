Aberrant accentuation of neurofibrillary degeneration in the hippocampus of Alzheimer 's disease with amyloid precursor protein 717 and presenilin-1 gene mutations . This study reports correlation of the hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles ( NFT ) density with beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) precursor protein ( P05067 ) 717 mutation , presenilin ( PS ) -1 mutation and apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) e4 alleles ( E4 ) , being graded as 3 forms ( no-E4 , one-E4 and two-E4 ) in autopsied brains from patients with familial and non-familial Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . We studied the density of NFT-free neurons , intracellular NFT ( I-NFT ) , extracellular NFT ( E-NFT ) and total NFT ( I-NFT plus E-NFT ) in the six hippocampal subdivisions : cornu ammonis ( CA ) 1- P22748 , subiculum and entorhinal cortex . The P05067 mutation cases showed significantly higher total NFT density in the P00915 - P00918 region , and the P49768 mutation cases also showed higher density of total NFT in the P00915 - P07451 than non-familial cases . Moreover , high densities of the E-NFT contributed to these high total NFT densities . Non-familial AD cases showed a stereotypical NFT distribution with entorhinal accentuation in the hippocampus irrespective of E4 frequency . Thus , P05067 and P49768 mutations predominantly affect the CA regions with profound neurodegeneration , which contributes early and severe clinical features of familial AD .
