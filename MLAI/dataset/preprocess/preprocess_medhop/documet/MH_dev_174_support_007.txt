DB04868 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia . The introduction of targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . The pivotal role of the Philadelphia chromosome , resulting from the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson ( P11274 - P00519 ) translocation , led to the development of imatinib mesylate , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity against the P11274 - P00519 oncoprotein . Unprecedented clinical activity in CML led to rapid approval and established first-line therapy with imatinib mesylate as the standard of care in most patients . However , the occurrence of imatinib resistance or intolerance has sparked the development of newer drugs with increased activity or specificity . DB04868 is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been rationally designed on the basis of imatinib . An overview is given on clinical results in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients that led to its current approval as second-line therapy for the chronic and accelerated phases of CML . Future studies will address the role of nilotinib as first-line therapy , in combination strategies and in the context of specific P11274 - P00519 mutations .
