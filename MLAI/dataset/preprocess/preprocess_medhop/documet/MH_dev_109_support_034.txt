A new epigenetic challenge : systemic lupus erythematosus . In recent years , compelling evidence has been gathered that supports a role for epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . Different blood cell populations of SLE patients are characterized by a global loss of DNA methylation . This process is associated with defects in P29323 pathway signalling and consequent P26358 1 downregulation . Hypomethylation of gene promoters has been described , which permits transcriptional activation and therefore functional changes in the cells and also hypomethylation of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster . Among the identified targets undergoing demethylation are genes involved in autoreactivity ( P20701 ) , osmotic lysis and apoptosis ( P14222 , P50281 and P80188 ) , antigen presentation ( Q99062 ) , inflammation ( MMP 14 ) , B- T-cell interaction ( P32970 and P29965 ) and cytokine pathways ( Q99062 , P05112 , P05231 and P38484 ) . DNA methylation inhibitors are also known to induce autoreactivity in vitro and cause a lupus-like disease in vivo . Further , altered patterns of histone modifications have been described in SLE . P01730 + lymphocytes undergo global histone H3 and H4 deacetylation and consequent skewed gene expression . Although multiple lines of evidence highlight the contribution of epigenetic alterations to the pathogenesis of lupus in genetically predisposed individuals , many questions remain to be answered . Attaining a deeper understanding of these matters will create opportunities in the promising area of epigenetic treatments .
