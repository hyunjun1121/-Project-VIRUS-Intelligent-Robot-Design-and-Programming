SnoN/SkiL expression is modulated via arsenic trioxide-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cells . SnoN/SkiL ( TGFβ regulator ) is dysregulated in ovarian cancer , a disease associated with acquired drug-resistance . DB01169 ( As₂O₃ , used in treating APL ) induces SnoN to oppose the apoptotic response in ovarian cancer cells . We now report that As₂O₃ increases phosphorylation of P00533 /p66ShcA and P00533 degradation . As₂O₃ activates Src(Y416) whose activity ( inhibited by Q99463 ) modulates P00533 activation , its interaction with Shc/Grb2 , and p-AKT . Inhibition of PI3K reduces SnoN and cell survival . Although P00533 or P28482 siRNA did not alter SnoN expression , As₂O₃-induced cleaved PARP was reduced together with increased P98170 . Collectively , As₂O₃ mediates an initial rise in pY-Src(416) to regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway which increases SnoN and cell survival ; these early events may counter the cell death response associated with increased pY- P00533 /MAPK activation .
