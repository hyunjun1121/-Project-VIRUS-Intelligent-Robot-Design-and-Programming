Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of intracerebroventricularly administered somatostatin : behavioral and neurophysiological evidence . Somatostatin ( P61278 ) is a cyclic polypeptide that inhibits the release of a variety of regulatory hormones ( e.g. growth hormone , insulin , glucagon , thyrotropin ) . Moreover , P61278 is widely distributed within the CNS , acting both as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator of other neurotransmitter systems . However , despite its extensive expression in limbic areas , and its co-localization with GABA , a neurotransmitter previously implicated in emotion , the effects of P61278 on anxiety and depression have not been investigated . By performing intraventricular infusions in rats we demonstrate , for the first time , that P61278 has anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in the elevated plus-maze and forced swim test , respectively . In addition , by performing local field potential recordings of hippocampal theta activity evoked by reticular stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats we also show that P61278 application suppresses the frequency of theta in a similar fashion to diazepam . This neurophysiological signature , common to all classes of anxiolytic drugs ( i.e. benzodiazepines , selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors , P08908 agonists ) provides strong converging evidence for the anxiolytic-like characteristics of P61278 . Our pharmacological antagonism experiments with bicuculline further suggest that the anxiolytic effect of P61278 may be attributable to the interaction of P61278 with GABA , whereas the antidepressant-like effect of P61278 may be GABA-independent . In addition to contributing to the current understanding of the role of neuropeptides in mood and emotion , these findings support a clinical role for P61278 ( or its analogues ) in the treatment of anxiety and depression .
