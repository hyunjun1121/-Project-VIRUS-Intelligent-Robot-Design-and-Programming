GABA , glutamate , dopamine and serotonin transporters expression on forgetting . Notwithstanding several neurotransmission systems are frequently related to memory formation ; forgetting process and neurotransmission systems or their transporters ; the role of Î³-aminobutyric acid ( P30531 ) , glutamate ( EACC1 ) , dopamine ( Q01959 ) and serotonin ( P31645 ) is poorly understood . Hence , in this paper western-blot analysis was used to evaluate expression of P30531 , P43005 , Q01959 and P31645 during forgetting in trained and untrained rats treated with the selective serotonin transporter inhibitor fluoxetine , the amnesic drug d-methamphetamine ( METH ) and fluoxetine plus METH . Transporters expression was determined in the hippocampus ( HIP ) , prefrontal cortex ( P27918 ) and striatum ( STR ) . Results indicated that forgetting of Pavlovian/instrumental autoshaping was associated to up-regulation of P30531 ( P27918 and HIP ) and Q01959 ( P27918 ) while P31645 ( HIP ) was down-regulated ; no-changes were observed in striatum . Methamphetamine administration did not affect forgetting at 216 h post-training but up-regulated hippocampal Q01959 and EACC , prefrontal cortex Q01959 and striatal P30531 or EACC1 . DB00472 alone prevented forgetting , which was associated to striatal P30531 and hippocampal Q01959 up-regulation , but prefrontal cortex P30531 down-regulation . DB00472 plus METH administration was also able to prevent forgetting , which was associated to hippocampal Q01959 , prefrontal cortex P31645 and striatal P30531 , Q01959 or P31645 up-regulation , but prefrontal cortex P30531 down-regulation . Together these data show that forgetting provokes primarily hippocampal and prefrontal cortex transporters changes ; forgetting represent a behavioral process hardly modifiable and its prevention could causes different transporters expression patterns .
