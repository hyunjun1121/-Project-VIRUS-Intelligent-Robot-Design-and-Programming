Effects of vandetanib on lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor T790M mutation in vivo . DB05294 is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 ) , with additional inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and rearranged during transfection receptor signaling , which has shown promising results in clinical trials for advanced non-small cell lung cancer . However , the mechanisms of acquired resistance to vandetanib remain unclear . Therefore , we established in vitro vandetanib-resistant PC-9/VanR cells from PC-9 , a vandetanib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cell line , by chronic exposure to this agent . PC-9/VanR cells were 50-fold more resistant to vandetanib than PC-9 cells in vitro . Compared with PC-9 cells , PC-9/VanR cells showed emergence of an P00533 T790M mutation , moderately elevated MET amplification , and similar P35968 inhibition by vandetanib . Note that phospho-MET in PC-9/VanR was suppressed following P00533 inhibition by an irreversible P00533 -TKI , indicating that MET signaling of PC-9/VanR was dependent on P00533 signaling and that MET amplification was not the primary mechanism of resistance to vandetanib . In contrast to the in vitro experiment , vandetanib effectively inhibited the growth of PC-9/VanR tumors in an in vivo xenograft model through the antiangiogenesis effects of P35968 inhibition . In conclusion , the multitarget TKI vandetanib induced or selected for the P00533 T790M mutation as observed previously with highly selective P00533 -TKIs . However , vandetanib retained significant efficacy in vivo against xenografts harboring the T790M mutation , providing a strong scientific rationale for investigating vandetanib in clinical settings where acquired resistance through emergence of P00533 T790M mutations limits the effectiveness of highly selective P00533 -TKIs .
