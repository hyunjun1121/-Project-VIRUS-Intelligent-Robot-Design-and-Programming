Sulphomucin colonic type intestinal metaplasia and carcinoma in the stomach . A histochemical study of 115 cases obtained by biopsy . One hundred fifteen gastroscopic biopsy specimens ( 54 cases of carcinoma and 61 of gastritis ) were used in this histochemical study . Intestinal metaplasia ( IM ) was classified into small intestinal type ( ST ) and colonic type ( CT ) . The former may be a reactive change only . The incidence of sulphomucin colonic type ( P09683 ) metaplasia was higher in gastric carcinomas than in benign lesions ( P less than 0.01 ) , and a relation between P09683 metaplasia and cancer was demonstrated by both histologic and histochemical procedures . This suggests that P09683 IM is correlated with certain precancerous lesions . There was no significant difference in the incidence of O-acetyl sialomucin colonic type ( O75051 ) metaplasia between benign and malignant diseases . Further study is needed to determine why slightly more than half of the P09683 IM was accompanied by O75051 IM .
