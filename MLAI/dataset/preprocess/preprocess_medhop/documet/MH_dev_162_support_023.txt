Molecular evolution of the oxytocin-oxytocin receptor system in eutherians . DB00107 ( P01178 ) is a nine-amino-acid peptide hormone that is mainly released at the times of uterine contractions during parturition and milk ejection during lactation , whereas a similar peptide hormone , arginine vasopressin , primarily exerts direct antidiuretic action on the kidney and causes vasoconstriction of the peripheral vessels . The genes coding for these peptides are tandemly located on the same chromosome . A tandem duplication occurring in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates has been proposed as responsible . In contrast to the two peptide hormones , only one oxytocin receptor ( P30559 ) but three arginine vasopressin receptors ( P37288 , P47901 , and P30518 ) are known ; these receptors probably arose from two rounds of genome duplication in the common ancestor of vertebrates . In this study , we addressed the molecular evolution of the P01178 - P30559 system in eutherians . Our analyses suggest that an amino acid change from isoleucine to lysine on the eighth site ( I8L ) of the peptide , which corresponded to a change from mesotocin to P01178 , had occurred during the common ancestral lineage of eutherians . At around the same time that the emergence of P01178 occurred , functional constraints on the P01178 receptor ( pre- P30559 ) might have relaxed , and a series of nonsynonymous substitutions might have accumulated . Only a few of these nonsynonymous substitutions might have contributed to reestablishing the molecular relationship between the P01178 ligand and its receptor , after which functional constraints on the P30559 were reinstated . Since the P01178 - P30559 system plays an important role in eutherians , the evolution of the P01178 - P30559 system was probably an essential component of the genesis of the eutherian signature .
