Chronically increased ciliary neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 expression after spinal contusion in rats . Demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) are well documented . Recently , we showed oligodendrocyte progenitor cell ( OPC ) accumulation and robust oligodendrocyte genesis occurring along SCI lesion borders . We have since begun investigating potential mechanisms for this endogenous repair response . Here , we examined ciliary neurotrophic factor ( P26441 ) and fibroblast growth factor-2 ( P09038 ) expression , because both factors alter progenitor proliferation and differentiation and are increased in several CNS disorders . We hypothesized that P26441 and P09038 would increase after SCI , especially in regions of enhanced oligogenesis . First , P26441 protein was quantified using Western blots , which revealed that P26441 protein continually rose through 28 days post injury ( dpi ) . Next , by using immunohistochemistry , we examined the spatiotemporal expression of P26441 in cross-sections spanning the injury site . P26441 immunoreactivity was observed on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in na√Øve and contused spinal cords . Significantly increased P26441 was detected in spared white and gray matter between 5 and 28 dpi compared with uninjured controls . By 28 dpi , P26441 expression was significantly higher along lesion borders compared with outlying spared tissue ; a similar distribution of phosphorylated P40763 , a transcription factor up-regulated by P26441 and to a lesser extent P09038 , was also detected . Because P26441 can potentiate P09038 expression , we examined the distribution of P09038 + cells . Significantly more P09038 + cells were noted along lesion borders at 7 and 28 dpi . Thus , both P26441 and P09038 are present in regions of elevated OPC proliferation and oligodendrocyte generation after SCI and therefore may play a role in injury-induced gliogenesis .
