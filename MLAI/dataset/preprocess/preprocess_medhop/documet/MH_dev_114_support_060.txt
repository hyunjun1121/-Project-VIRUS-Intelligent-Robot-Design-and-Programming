Effects of ropivacaine on eicosanoid release from human granulocytes and endothelial cells in vitro . OBJECTIVE : To examine the effects of ropivacaine , currently being investigated for treatment of ulcerative colitis , on the release of arachidonic acid metabolites . MATERIAL : Human granulocytes and endothelial cells . TREATMENT : Ropivacaine , lidocaine , hydrocortisone , DB00244 or acetylsalicylic acid ( 10-1000 microM ) . METHODS : Leukotriene B4 , 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid , 6-keto PGF1 alpha and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were measured using immuno assays . Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical calculations . RESULTS : Ropivacaine dose-dependently inhibited zymosan-induced release of leukotriene B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid whereas the release after ionophore stimulation was not affected . Ropivacaine was more potent than DB00244 but less potent compared to hydrocortisone . Ropivacaine had only a weak inhibitory effect on the release of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid from zymosan- or ionophore-stimulated cells . In contrast to hydrocortisone and DB00244 , ropivacaine only weakly affected the release of 6-keto PGF1 alpha after stimulation with thrombin . CONCLUSIONS : The inhibited release of P09917 products may account for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of ropivacaine seen in the treatment of ulcerative colitis .
