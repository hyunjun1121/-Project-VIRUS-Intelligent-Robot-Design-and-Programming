DNA damage and related modifier genes in Italian cystic fibrosis patients . Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder showing a highly heterogeneous phenotype , even among siblings carrying identical P13569 mutations . Moreover , oxidative stress is of central importance in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis . The present study seeks to value the presence of oxidative damage in CF patients and the possible modifier effect of repair and glutathione-S-transferase genes . We analysed the presence of DNA damage in leukocytes of 63 CF patients at an Italian CF centre and 63 controls , through the alkaline Comet assay to detect DNA strand breaks . Furthermore , controls and 93 CF subjects were genotyped for 5 genes by RFLP-PCR ( P18887 ,0GG1, P09211 ) and PCR assay ( P09488 , P30711 ) . No difference in Comet assay values was observed comparing controls to CF patients , although CF subjects showed slightly higher mean values . The crude Odds-Ratio ( OR ) was higher than one for P18887 and P09211 genotypes and liver status and for P18887 and O15527 genotypes and pancreatic insufficiency , but in all cases the p-values were not significant . In this case-control study , neither DNA damage Ã±or gene polymorphisms seem to influence CF manifestation .
