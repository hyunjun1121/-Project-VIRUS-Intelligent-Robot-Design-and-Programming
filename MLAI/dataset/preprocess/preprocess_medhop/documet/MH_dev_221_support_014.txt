20-Epi analogues of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are highly potent inducers of DRIP coactivator complex binding to the vitamin D3 receptor . 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) plays a major role in the stimulation of bone growth , mineralization , and intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption ; it also acts as a general inhibitor of cellular proliferation . Several new , clinically relevant compounds dissociate antiproliferative and calcemic activities of 1,25(OH)2D3 , but the molecular basis for this has not been clearly elucidated . Here , we tested whether the potency of one class of compounds , 20-epi analogues , to induce myeloid cell differentiation , is because of direct molecular effects on vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) . We report that two 20-epi analogues , MC1627 and MC1288 , induced differentiation and transcription of P38936 (Waf1,Cip1) , a key P11473 target gene involved in growth inhibition , at a concentration 100-fold lower than that of 1,25(OH)2D3 . We compared this sensitivity to analogue effects on P11473 interacting proteins : RXR , Q9Y3R0 , and Q15648 , a subunit of the DRIP coactivator complex . Compared with the interaction of P11473 with RXR or Q9Y3R0 , the differentiation dose-response most closely correlated to the ligand-dependent recruitment of the DRIP coactivator complex to P11473 and to the ability of the receptor to activate transcription in a cell-free system . These results provide compelling links between the efficiency of the 20-epi analogue in inducing P11473 /DRIP interactions , transactivation in vitro , and its enhanced ability to induce cellular differentiation .
