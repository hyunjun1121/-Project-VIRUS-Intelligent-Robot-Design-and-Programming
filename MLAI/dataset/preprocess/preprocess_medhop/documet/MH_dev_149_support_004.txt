Systemic sclerosis - a systematic overview : part 2 - immunosuppression , treatment of SSc-associated vasculopathy , and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension . Here we give an overview over treatment recommendations propagated by the European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) , EULAR Scleroderma Trials and Research Group , the German Network for Systemic Sclerosis , the European Respiratory Society , and the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation . As response to immunosuppressant ( IS ) therapy is usually weaker in systematic sclerosis ( SSc ) compared to other connective tissue disorders IS should be considered with caution . To prevent scleroderma renal crisis steroid doses should not exceed 15 mg/d . The definitive role of a number of new immunosuppressant drugs and the effects of autologous stem cell transplantation in systemic clerosis ( SSc ) have to be elucidated . Prostanoids , especially iloprost , are widely used as intravenous formulas for the treatment of severe Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) and digital ulcers ( DU ) . DB01373 antagonists are of limited therapeutic value . DB00559 , an oral endothelin receptor antagonists ( P25101 ) , was shown to prevent new DU , but failed to heal existing DU , while the oral phopshodiesterase inhibitor ( P07237 ) DB00203 reduces the occurrence of RP and might be effective in ulcer healing . Combination therapies of P07237 with P25101 are currently evaluated . Therapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is usually started as oral monotherapy , frequently using an P25101 . When this first-line therapy is not tolerated P25101 is substituted by P07237 . If treatment goals are not reached with monotherapy combinationtherapy is started , for example by adding a P07237 to an existing P25101 . In general , treatment of PAH in patients with connective tissue disease follows the same algorithms as in idiopathic PAH .
