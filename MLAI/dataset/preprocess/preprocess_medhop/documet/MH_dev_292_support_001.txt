P08235 antagonists do not block rapid P29323 activation by aldosterone . DB04630 can elicit rapid nongenomic effects both in vivo and in vitro , often mediated by signal transduction cascades . However , it is not understood how these rapid effects are initiated . In this study we show that aldosterone leads to rapid activation of mitogen activated protein kinases P27361 /2 in the cortical collecting duct cell line M-1 . Inhibitors of transcription and translation could not block this activation , which suggests an extranuclear ( nongenomic ) mechanism . Although it is known that M-1 cells do not contain a transcriptionally functional MR , it is not known whether a closely related protein still could mediate the effects , or an unrelated nonclassic receptor . To test this hypothesis , the effects of four classical mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were studied . None of the compounds could block the response to aldosterone . Altogether , the data suggest that rapid aldosterone effects in M-1 cells are initiated by a receptor different from the classical mineralocorticoid receptor .
