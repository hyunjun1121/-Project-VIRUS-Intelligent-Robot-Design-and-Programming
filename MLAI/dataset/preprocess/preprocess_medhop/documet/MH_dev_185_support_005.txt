Antidepressant properties of the Q13639 receptor partial agonist , SL65.0155 : behavioral and neurochemical studies in rats . This study was undertaken to investigate the potential antidepressant-like properties of SL65.0155 , a serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist , in male rats of the Wistar strain tested in the forced swim test ( P19883 ) , an experimental model widely used to assess antidepressant-like activity . The expression of hippocampal neurotrophic factors , such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) , the phosphorilated DB02527 response element-binding protein ( p-CREB ) , the B cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2 ) , the Bax and the vascular endothelium growth factor ( P15692 ) were also evaluated by Western Blot analysis . Different groups of rats received intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) injections of SL65.0155 ( 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 mg/kg ) , clomipramine ( 50 mg/kg ) , citalopram ( 15 mg/kg ) or vehicle , respectively , 24 , 5 and 1 h prior to the P19883 . Compared to the control group , SL65.0155 ( 0.5 and 1 mg/kg ) , clomipramine or citalopram injected animals showed an increased swimming and climbing behavior and reduced immobility time in the P19883 . Interestingly , this effect was not due to changes in the locomotor activity since all treated groups failed to show any change in motor ability as assessed in the open field test . Western blot analysis of hippocampal homogenates showed an enhancement of p-CREB , P23560 Bcl-2 and P15692 protein levels in SL65.0155 treated groups , but not in citalopram or clomipramine treated groups , used here as positive control . No change was found in Bax expression in any treated group . These findings give further support to the hypothesis that the stimulation of serotonin 5-HT(4) receptors may be a therapeutic target for depression .
