Serotonin skews human macrophage polarization through P41595 and P34969 . Besides its role as a neurotransmitter , serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5HT ) regulates inflammation and tissue repair via a set of receptors ( 5HT(1-7) ) whose pattern of expression varies among cell lineages . Considering the importance of macrophage polarization plasticity for inflammatory responses and tissue repair , we evaluated whether 5HT modulates human macrophage polarization . 5HT inhibited the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting P22301 production , upregulated the expression of M2 polarization-associated genes ( P05120 , P07996 , Q9NY15 , Q86Y22 ) , and reduced the expression of M1-associated genes ( P08476 , P41597 , P39900 , P05121 , P29016 , O94788 ) . Whereas only 5HT(7) mediated the inhibitory action of 5HT on the release of proinflammatory cytokines , both 5HT(2B) and 5HT(7) receptors mediated the pro-M2 skewing effect of 5HT . In fact , blockade of both receptors during in vitro monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation preferentially modulated the acquisition of M2 polarization markers . 5HT(2B) was found to be preferentially expressed by anti-inflammatory M2( P09603 ) macrophages and was detected in vivo in liver Kupffer cells and in tumor-associated macrophages . Therefore , 5HT modulates macrophage polarization and contributes to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory state via 5HT(2B) and 5HT(7) , whose identification as functionally relevant markers for anti-inflammatory/homeostatic human M2 macrophages suggests their potential therapeutic value in inflammatory pathologies .
