DB02709 protects against peripheral deficits in a mouse model of Huntington 's disease . Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylases that regulate important biologic processes including transcription , cell survival and metabolism . Activation of Q96EB6 , a mammalian sirtuin , extends longevity and increases neuronal survival . An important substrate of Q96EB6 is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha ( P20142 -1alpha ) , a principal regulator of energy metabolism , whose function is significantly impaired in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) . We studied the effects of a pharmacological preparation of the Q96EB6 activator resveratrol ( DB05073 -M ) , in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD . We analyzed motor performance , survival , central and peripheral pathology and levels of P20142 -1alpha expression . Administration of DB05073 -M increased expression of P20142 -1alpha , as well as its downstream targets , nuclear respiratory factor-1 ( Q16656 ) and uncoupling protein-1 ( P25874 -1 ) in brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) , but there was no effect on P20142 -1alpha , Q16656 or the mitochondrial transcription factor ( Tfam ) in the striatum . DB05073 -M administration also reduced Q14032 vacuolation and decreased elevated blood glucose levels . However , there was no significant improvement in weight loss , motor performance , survival and striatal atrophy . Activation of the P20142 -1alpha signaling pathway via resveratrol-induced activation of Q96EB6 , therefore , is an effective therapy in Q14032 , but not in the central nervous system of HD transgenic mice .
