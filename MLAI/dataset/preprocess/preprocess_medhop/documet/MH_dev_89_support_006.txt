Transmitter neurochemistry of the efferent neuron system innervating the labyrinth . It is likely that several mechanisms contribute to the efferent control of cochlear and vestibular function . Different effects are probably mediated by different neuronal transmitters . In spite of a number of transmitter candidates , it is still widely assumed that the entire efferent system can be globally characterized as cholinergic . We attempted to label retrogradely identified efferent neurons in the brainstem with a monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , the acetylcholine ( ACh ) synthesizing enzyme . Only a portion of the vestibular efferents could thus be shown to be cholinergic in the rat . Medial cochlear efferents , terminating under outer hair cells , may also be cholinergic since they stain intensely for acetylcholine esterase ( P22303 ) after pre-treatment with the P22303 inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate ( DB00677 ) . The lateral cochlear efferents terminating under inner hair cells , as well as more than half of the vestibular efferent neuron population , reacted negatively with either method designed to identify cholinergic neurons . Half of the lateral olivo-cochlear neuron population filled retrogradely with tritiated gamma-amino butyric acid [ ( 3H ] -GABA ) . These cells were similar in size and distribution to neurons staining for the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) . Retrograde transport of [ 3H ] -aspartate from the inner ear to the brainstem was seen in half of the lateral olivocochlear population , as well as in part of the efferent vestibular population in group E and in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus ( P16435 ) . Since various peptides have also been located in efferent neurons , this system is chemically diversified . Several distinct mechanisms of efferent control with presumably differing functions must , therefore , exist .
