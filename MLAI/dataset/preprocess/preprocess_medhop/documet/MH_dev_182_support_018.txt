Endocannabinoids as autoregulatory signaling molecules : coupling to nitric oxide and a possible association with the relaxation response . Endocannabinoid signaling processes are present in diverse organisms and in organisms 500 million years divergent in evolution . Cannabinoid receptor-1 expression ( P21554 ) , anandamide , and anandamide amidase have been found in invertebrates . Furthermore , this signaling system is coupled to constitutive nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) -derived nitric oxide ( NO ) release in both vertebrates and invertebrates , thereby regulating neural , immune , and vascular-like functions in these divergent organisms . In human endothelial cells from various blood vessels , P21554 immunoreactive components are present as is its coupling to anandamide-stimulated P29474 -derived NO production , which exerts an autoregulatory role on P29474 release . The modulation of vascular diameter and vascular tone represents a crucial point of interest in these pathways , and interactions between NO and the sympathetic nerve system are of importance , i.e , norepinephrine . Here , a possible association of NO and endocannabinoid signaling with the relaxation response , a physiological counterpart of the stress response , may exist .
