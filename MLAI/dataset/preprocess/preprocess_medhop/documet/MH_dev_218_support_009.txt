[ DB02424 administration reduces the number of P07900 -positive germ cells in the mouse embryo : preliminary results ] . 5 mg of DB02424 , an inhibitor of stress protein P07900 which express on mammalian germ cells , were administered to E8 pregnant mice . E17 embryos were removed , and a quantitative analysis of HSP90-immunoreactive cells in the gonad was performed , in comparison to control embryos . First , we observed that the number of germ cells is lower in male than in female embryos , as well in control and experimental embryos . External features of experimental and control embryos did not display any difference . Embryos exposed to geldanamycin exhibit a significant decrease of immunoreactive germ cells . In two embryos , we observed a group of ectopic immunoreactive cells in the pelvic area . We conclude that geldanamycin inhibits germ cells migration , and suggest that this inhibition can lead to ectopic germ cell populations , similar to teratomas .
