Role of genetic polymorphisms of ion channels in the pathophysiology of coronary microvascular dysfunction and ischemic heart disease . Conventionally , ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) is equated with large vessel coronary disease . However , recent evidence has suggested a role of compromised microvascular regulation in the etiology of IHD . Because regulation of coronary blood flow likely involves activity of specific ion channels , and key factors involved in endothelium-dependent dilation , we proposed that genetic anomalies of ion channels or specific endothelial regulators may underlie coronary microvascular disease . We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding for ion channels expressed in the coronary vasculature and the possible correlation with IHD resulting from microvascular dysfunction . 242 consecutive patients who were candidates for coronary angiography were enrolled . A prospective , observational , single-center study was conducted , analyzing genetic polymorphisms relative to ( 1 ) NOS3 encoding for endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) ; ( 2 ) P16615 encoding for the Ca²⁺/H⁺-ATPase pump ( SERCA ) ; ( 3 ) Q14524 encoding for the voltage-dependent Na⁺ channel ( Nav1.5 ) ; ( 4 ) Q15842 and Q14654 encoding for the Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 subunits of K- DB00171 channels , respectively ; and ( 5 ) KCN5A encoding for the voltage-gated K⁺ channel ( Kv1.5 ) . No significant associations between clinical IHD manifestations and polymorphisms for SERCA , Kir6.1 , and Kv1.5 were observed ( p > 0.05 ) , whereas specific polymorphisms detected in P29474 , as well as in Kir6.2 and Nav1.5 were found to be correlated with IHD and microvascular dysfunction . Interestingly , genetic polymorphisms for ion channels seem to have an important clinical impact influencing the susceptibility for microvascular dysfunction and IHD , independent of the presence of classic cardiovascular risk factors .
