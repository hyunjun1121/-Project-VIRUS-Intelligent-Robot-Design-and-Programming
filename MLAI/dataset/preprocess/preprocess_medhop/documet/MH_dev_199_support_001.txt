[ Synthesis of ( 2'-bromo-4 ' , 5'-dimethoxy-phenyl ) -(2,3-dibromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-methane as P18031 inhibitor ] . OBJECTIVE : To synthesize (2'-bromo-4',5'-dimethoxy-phenyl)- ( 2,3- dibromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl ) -methane ( 6 ) as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( P18031 ) inhibitor . METHOD : DB04088 was synthesized by Friedel-Crafts reaction , bromination and decarbonylation and screened inhibitory activity against P18031 by the colorimetric assay . The structure of synthetic intermediates and target product were identified on the basis of spectral analysis . RESULT : DB04088 was synthesized successfully in four steps and evaluated for its P18031 inhibitory activity , the screening result shown that compound 6 displayed good inhibitory activity against P18031 . CONCLUSION : The target compound 6 was synthesized with the overall yield of 20 % , which was a new compound and shown good inhibitory activity against P18031 ( inhibition 40.16 % at 5 mg x L(-1) ) .
