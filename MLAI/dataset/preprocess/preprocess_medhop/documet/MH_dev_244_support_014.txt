Selective modulation of promoter recruitment and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor regulated by the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) . We studied selective modulation of endogenous genes by PPARgamma ligands using microarray , RNA expression kinetics , and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . We found over 300 genes that were significantly regulated the TZDs pioglitazone , rosiglitazone , and troglitazone . TZD-mediated expression profiles were unique but overlapping . Ninety-one genes were commonly regulated by all three ligands . TZD time course and dose-response studies revealed gene- and TZD-specific expression kinetics . PEPCK expression was induced rapidly but Q16654 expression was induced gradually . DB00197 EC50 values for PEPCK , Q16654 , and P41220 regulation were greater than those for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone . TZDs differentially induced histone acetylation of and PPARgamma recruitment to target gene promoters . Selective modulation of PPARgamma by TZDs resulted in distinct expression profiles and transcription kinetics which may be due to differential promoter activation and chromatin remodeling of target genes .
