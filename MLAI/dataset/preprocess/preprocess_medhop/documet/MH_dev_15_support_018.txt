Silencing alpha-fetoprotein inhibits P15692 and P08253 /9 production in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell . P02771 not only serves as a diagnostic marker for liver cancer , but also posses a variety of biological functions . However , the role of P02771 on tumor angiogenesis and cell invasion remains incompletely understood . In this study , we aimed to evaluate if P02771 can regulate the major angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases in human liver cancer cells . P02771 silencing was achieved by Stealth RNAi . Expression of P02771 was examined by a full-automatic electrochemistry luminescence immunity analyzer . Expression of P15692 , P35968 , P14780 , and P08253 was examined by Western blot and immunocytochemistry . Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay . Angiogenesis was detected by in vitro angiogenesis assay kit . Silencing of P02771 led to an increased apoptosis , which was associated with a decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 , matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 . These results suggest that P02771 may play a regulatory role on angiogenesis and cell invasion during liver cancer development .
