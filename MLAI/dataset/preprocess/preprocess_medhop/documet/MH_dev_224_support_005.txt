AVE3085 protects coronary endothelium from the impairment of asymmetric dimethylarginine by activation and recoupling of P29474 . PURPOSE : DB01686 ( DB01686 ) is an endogenous inhibitor of P29474 and it is recognized as a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases . We investigated the effect of AVE3085 , a newly developed transcription enhancer of P29474 , on DB01686 -induced endothelial dysfunction in coronary arteries with underlying mechanisms explored . METHODS : Porcine coronary small arteries ( diameter 600-800 Î¼m ) were studied in a myograph for endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin and endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside . Protein expressions of P29474 and phosphorylated- P29474 ( p- P29474 (Ser1177) and p- P29474 (Thr495) ) , and nitrotyrosine formation were determined by Western blot . NO release was directly measured with a NO microsensor . Productions of O(2) ( .- ) and peroxynitrite ( ONOO(-) ) were determined by lucigenin- and luminol- enhanced chemiluminescence respectively . RESULTS : Exposure to DB01686 significantly decreased the bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation and reduced the protein expression of p- P29474 (Ser1177) whereas increased the expression of p- P29474 (Thr495) and nitrotyrosine . Pre-incubation with AVE3085 restored the bradykinin-induced relaxation , reversed the decrease of p- P29474 (Ser1177) , and lowered the level of p- P29474 (Thr495) and nitrotyrosine . NO release in response to bradykinin was significantly reduced by DB01686 and such reduction was restored by AVE3085 . AVE3085 also prevented the elevation of O ( 2 ) ( .- ) and ONOO(-) levels in coronary arteries exposed to DB01686 . CONCLUSIONS : AVE3085 prevents DB01686 -induced endothelial dysfunction in coronary arteries . The protective effect of AVE3085 may be attributed to increased NO production resulting from enhanced P29474 activation , and decreased oxidative stress that involves inhibition of O ( 2 ) ( .- ) generation by P29474 recoupling . The present study suggested the therapeutic potential of AVE3085 in endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disorders .
