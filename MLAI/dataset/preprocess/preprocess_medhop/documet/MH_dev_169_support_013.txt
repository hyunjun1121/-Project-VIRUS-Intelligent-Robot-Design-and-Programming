Prevention of rethrombosis after coronary thrombolysis in a chronic canine model . I . Adjunctive therapy with monoclonal antibody 7E3 F(ab')2 fragment . We examined the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) 7E3 F(ab')2 fragment , an inhibitor of the platelet glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor , to prevent coronary artery rethrombosis after successful thrombolysis with rt-PA . The circumflex coronary artery of anesthetized dogs was instrumented with a flow probe , an electrode , and a stenosis . After recovery from the surgical procedure , the animals were reanesthetized on post-operative day 9 , and vessel wall injury was induced with current applied to the intimal surface of the circumflex coronary artery . The resulting occlusive thrombus was aged for 30 min , and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) was administered . The animals were allocated to receive either placebo or a single dose of DB00054 [ 0.8 mg/kg intravenous ( i.v. ) bolus ] as the sole adjunctive agent . Ex vivo platelet function and coronary artery blood flow velocity were recorded on each of 5 consecutive days . Reocclusion and mortality were reduced significantly in animals treated with 7E3 as compared with the placebo-treated group . Significant inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation persisted for 48 h after a single injection of DB00054 . The MoAb 7E3 F(ab')2 fragment is effective as the sole adjunctive agent with rt-PA for prevention of rethrombosis . The present study is unique in that it examined the efficacy of P08514 /IIIa inhibition in an experimental model for an extended time , demonstrating the duration of antiplatelet therapy required to prevent rethrombosis after thrombolysis .
