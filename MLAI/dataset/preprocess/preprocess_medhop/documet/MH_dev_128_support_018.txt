Clinical trials in thrombolytic therapy , Part 2 : The open-artery hypothesis and RAPID-1 and RAPID-2 . The open-artery hypothesis as supported by thrombolytic study results is discussed . The open-artery hypothesis states that survival after acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) is maximized by achieving early and sustained patency of the infarct-related artery . However , two large multicenter trials did not detect any difference in mortality between patients given alteplase and patients given streptokinase , despite previous evidence that alteplase led to earlier recanalization of infarct-related arteries . The Global Utilization of DB00086 and Tissue P00747 Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries ( GUSTO-1 ) trial suggested that early and complete patency is essential for short-term survival after AMI . Subsequent observations indicated that an open infarct-related artery at the time of hospital discharge is associated with improved long-term survival . In the DB00015 Angiographic Phase II International Dose-Finding ( RAPID-1 ) trial , complete patency was more frequent in patients who received a double-bolus regimen of reteplase than in patients who received standard-dose alteplase . Similar results were obtained in the DB00015 versus DB00009 Patency Investigation during Myocardial Infarction ( RAPID-2 ) trial , which compared the same double-bolus reteplase regimen with an accelerated regimen of alteplase . In both RAPID studies , mortality was lower and other outcomes were more favorable in reteplase recipients . DB00015 seems more likely to produce normal blood flow soon after AMI than either standard-dose or accelerated alteplase and may be associated with a lower mortality rate . This lends further support to the open-artery hypothesis .
