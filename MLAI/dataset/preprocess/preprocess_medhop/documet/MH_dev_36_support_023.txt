Enhanced incentive motivation for sucrose-paired cues in adolescent rats : possible roles for dopamine and opioid systems . Vulnerability to the effects of drugs of abuse during adolescence may be related to altered incentive motivation , a process believed to be important in addiction . Incentive motivation can be seen when a neutral stimulus acquires motivational properties through repeated association with a primary reinforcer . We compared adolescent ( postnatal day ( P01160 ) 24-50 ) and adult ( > P01160 70 ) rats on a measure of incentive motivation : responding for a conditioned reinforcer ( CR ) . Rats learned to associate the delivery of 0.1 ml of 10 % sucrose with a conditioned stimulus ( CS ; light and tone ) ; 30 pairings per day were given over 14 days . Then , we measured responding on a lever delivering the CS ( now a CR ) after injections of amphetamine ( 0 , 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg ) . We also examined responding for CR when the CS and sucrose were paired or unpaired during conditioning , and responding for the primary reinforcer ( 10 % sucrose ) in control experiments . Finally , we examined the effects of D(1) and P14416 antagonists ( P35240 39166 and eticlopride , respectively ) and an opioid receptor antagonist ( naltrexone ) on responding for a CR in adolescent rats . Adolescents but not adults acquired responding for a CR , but adolescents responded less than adults for the primary reinforcer . Responding for a CR depended upon the pairing of the CS and sucrose during conditioning . Both dopamine and opioid receptor antagonists reduced responding for the CR . Therefore , incentive motivation may be enhanced in adolescents compared with adults , and incentive motivation may be mediated in part by both dopamine and opioid systems .
