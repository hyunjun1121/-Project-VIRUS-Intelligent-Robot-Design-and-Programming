Regulatory T cells increase in breast cancer and in stage IV breast cancer . Expression levels of P15692 and Her-2 , levels of T-regulatory ( Treg ) cells , levels of CD3+ cells , and ratios of Th ( P01730 + T cells ) /Tr ( Treg ) cells were compared between stage I , II , III , and IV breast cancer patients ( n = 120 ) prior to chemotherapy and healthy women ( n = 30 ) . Cells from peripheral blood were counted by flow cytometry , Her-2 and P15692 expression was detected by pathological examination , and Her-2 was detected by Q5TCZ1 . Breast cancer patients had more Treg cells and a lower ratio of Th/Tr cells than the healthy women . Stage IV breast cancer patients had more Treg cells and a lower ratio of Th/Tr cells than stage I , II , or III breast cancer patients . Patients positive for P15692 had a lower ratio of Th/Tr cells compared with patients negative for P15692 , and those positive for both P15692 and Her-2 also had a lower ratio of Th/Tr cells compared with patients not positive for both P15692 and Her-2 . The decreased Th/Tr cells ratio indicates impaired immune function , suggesting that the stage IV breast cancer and the Her-2/ P15692 -positive breast cancer patients have lower immune function .
