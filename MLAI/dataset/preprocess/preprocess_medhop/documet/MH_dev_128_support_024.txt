Gene expression studies provide clues to the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma : new evidence and a systematic review . BACKGROUND : Uterine leiomyomas are extremely common and a major cause of pelvic pain , bleeding , infertility , and the leading indication for hysterectomy . Familial and epidemiological studies provide compelling evidence that genetic alterations play an important role in leiomyoma development . METHODS : Using Affymetrix U133A GeneChip we analysed expression profiles of 22,283 genes in paired samples of leiomyoma and adjacent normal myometrium . We compared our results with previously published data on gene expression in uterine leiomyoma and identified the overlapping gene alterations . RESULTS : We detected 80 genes with average differences of > or = 2-fold and false discovery rates of < 5 % ( 14 overexpressed and 66 underexpressed ) . A comparative analysis including eight previous gene expression studies revealed eight prominent genes ( P07327 , P18847 , P29373 , O00622 , Q07507 , P42262 , P01344 , Q5EB52 ) identified by at least five different studies , eleven genes ( P00352 , P25063 , P29279 , O43602 , P28562 , P01100 , O60829 , P24592 , P41222 , P43115 , P04818 ) reported by four studies , twelve genes ( ABCA , P04083 , Q15847 , O00585 , P38936 , Q14194 , P54849 , P03372 , FY , Q99683 , P37173 , P35625 ) identified by three studies , and 40 genes reported by two different studies . CONCLUSIONS : Review of gene expression data revealed concordant changes in genes regulating retinoid synthesis , IGF metabolism , TGF-beta signaling and extracellular matrix formation . Gene expression studies provide clues to the relevant pathways of leiomyoma development .
