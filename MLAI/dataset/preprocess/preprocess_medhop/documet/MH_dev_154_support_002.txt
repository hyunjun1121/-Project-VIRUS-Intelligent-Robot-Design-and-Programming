DB00013 plasminogen activator , Q03405 , P08253 , and P14780 in the P13671 -glioblastoma rat model . BACKGROUND : In glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , the serine protease urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , and matrix metalloproteases ( P08253 / P14780 ) contribute to its invasive growth pattern , which is the major obstacle to successful surgical treatment . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The expression of uPA was determined in monolayers and spheroids of the rodent GBM cell line P13671 by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The longitudinal expression of proteases was studied in orthotopically implanted spheroids by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) in Sprague Dawley rats ( n=40 ) . The tumor volume was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) . RESULTS : In vitro , the GBM cell line P13671 expresses high levels of uPA . In vivo , a continuous increase of uPA , uPA-receptor ( Q03405 ) , P08253 , and P14780 expression was found in the infiltration zone . uPA was located exclusively in the infiltration zone and in the vascular basal layers . The mean tumor volume 23 days after implantation was 3.2 mm3 . CONCLUSION : uPA , Q03405 , P08253 and P14780 play an important role in GBM growth . Blockade of uPA and interruption of the proteolytic cascade could become a useful tool in the therapy of GBM .
