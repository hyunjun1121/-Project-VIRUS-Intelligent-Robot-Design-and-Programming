P01344 Producing Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with DB00398 : Metabolic Complications and a Foresight to Molecular Targeting Therapy to the IGF Signal . Hypoglycemia is a rare paraneoplastic manifestation of patients with neoplasms . Hypoglycemia can be induced by several causes , including an aberrant increase of hypoglycemic agents and adrenal insufficiency . DB00398 is the first agent to demonstrate a survival benefit in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . This small molecule inhibits serine/threonine kinase RAF in tumor cells and tyrosine kinases VEGFR/ P09619 in tumor vasculature and decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis . In this paper , we report a case of HCC who was treated with sorafenib and showed severe hypoglycemia . This hypoglycemia might be induced by two causes , both adrenal insufficiency as an adverse effect of sorafenib and activation of the insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) signal by excessive secretion of incompletely processed precursors of P01344 . Although the IGF signal is suggested to be involved in aberrant growth of HCC in some cases , there is no other report showing the influence of sorafenib on HCC with active IGF signal . Unfortunately , the effect of sorafenib was limited in the present case . However , emerging drugs that directly inhibit the IGF signal can be expected to be highly effective in the treatment of HCC with hypoglycemia .
