The anti-interleukin-6 antibody siltuximab down-regulates genes implicated in tumorigenesis in prostate cancer patients from a phase I study . BACKGROUND : P05231 ( P05231 ) is associated with prostate cancer morbidity . In several experimental models , P05231 has been reported to have anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effects . DB09036 ( CNTO 328 ) is a monoclonal anti- P05231 antibody which has been successfully applied in several models representing prostate cancer . This study was designed to assess preliminary safety of siltuximab in patients with early prostate cancer . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Twenty patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy received either no drug or siltuximab ( 6 mg/kg , five patients per group with administration once , two times , and three times prior to surgery ) . Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses . Expression of elements of P05231 signaling pathways was analyzed in tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry . Gene analysis in tumor specimens was performed with the DASL array . RESULTS : No adverse events related to siltuximab were observed . Patients treated with siltuximab presented with higher levels of proliferation and apoptosis markers . Following a single dose , serum concentrations of siltuximab declined in a biexponential manner . This study revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of Stat3 and Q8TCB0 / Q8NFH3 mitogen-activated protein kinases . In addition , gene expression analyses indicate down-regulation of genes immediately downstream of the P05231 signaling pathway and key enzymes of the androgen signaling pathway . CONCLUSIONS : Preliminary safety of siltuximab is favorable . Future studies in which siltuximab could be combined with androgen-deprivation therapy and experimental therapies in advanced prostate cancer are justified .
