Therapeutic targeting of CPT-11 induced diarrhea : a case for prophylaxis . CPT-11 ( irinotecan ) , a P11387 inhibitor is one of the main treatments for colorectal cancer . The main dose limiting toxicities are neutropenia and late onset diarrhea . Though neutropenia is manageable , CPT-11 induced diarrhea is frequently severe , resulting in hospitalizations , dose reductions or omissions leading to ineffective treatment administration . Many potential agents have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies to prevent or ameliorate CPT-11 induced late onset diarrhea . It is predicted that prophylaxis of CPT-11 induced diarrhea will reduce sub-therapeutic dosing as well as hospitalizations and will eventually lead to dose escalations resulting in better response rates . This article reviews various experimental agents and strategies employed to prevent this debilitating toxicity . Covered topics include schedule/dose modification , intestinal alkalization , structural/chemical modification , genetic testing , anti-diarrheal therapies , transporter ( P08183 , Q92887 , Q96JK2 ) inhibitors , enzyme ( Î²-glucuronidase , P22309 , P08684 , carboxylesterase , P35354 ) inducers and inhibitors , probiotics , antibiotics , adsorbing agents , cytokine and growth factor activators and inhibitors and other miscellaneous agents .
