Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling is required for the behavioral actions of antidepressant treatment : pharmacological and cellular characterization . This study extends earlier work on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in the actions of antidepressant treatment in two key areas . First , by determining the requirement for P15692 in the actions of a 5-HT selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , fluoxetine in behavioral models of depression/antidepressant response ; and second , by examining the role of the P08908 receptor subtype in the regulation of P15692 , and the cellular localization of antidepressant regulation of P15692 expression . The results show that pharmacological inhibition of P15692 receptor signaling blocks the behavioral actions of fluoxetine in rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress . Infusions of SU5416 or SU1498 , two structurally dissimilar inhibitors of P15692 -Flk-1 receptor signaling , block the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine on sucrose preference , immobility in the forced swim test , and latency to feed in the novelty suppressed feeding paradigm . We also show that activation of P08908 receptors is sufficient to induce P15692 expression and that a P08908 antagonist blocks both the increase in P15692 and behavioral effects induced by fluoxetine . Finally , double labeling studies show that chronic fluoxetine administration increases P15692 expression in both neurons and endothelial cells in the hippocampus . Taken together these studies show that P15692 is necessary for the behavioral effects of the SSRI fluoxetine , as well as norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitor , and that these effects may be mediated by P08908 receptors located on neurons and endothelial cells .
