P10912 targeting to lipid rafts requires extracellular subdomain 2 . P10912 ( P10912 ) is a single membrane-spanning glycoprotein dimer that binds GH in its extracellular domain ( O95905 ) . GH activates the P10912 intracellular domain ( ICD ) -associated tyrosine kinase , O60674 , which causes intracellular signaling . We previously found that plasma membrane ( PM ) -associated P10912 was dramatically enriched in the lipid raft ( LR ) component of the membrane and that localization of P10912 within PM regions may regulate GH signaling by influencing the profile of pathway activation . In this study , we examined determinants of LR localization of the P10912 using a reconstitution system which lacks endogenous O60674 and P10912 . By non-detergent extraction and multistep fractionation , we found that P10912 was highly enriched in the LR fraction independent of O60674 expression . Various P10912 mutants were examined in transfectants harboring O60674 . LR concentration was observed for a P10912 in which the native transmembrane domain ( TMD ) is replaced by that of the unrelated P01130 and for a P10912 that lacks its ICD . Thus , LR association requires neither the TMD nor the ICD . Similarly , a P10912 that lacks the O95905 , except for the membrane-proximal O95905 stem region , was only minimally LR-concentrated . Mutants with internal stem deletions in the context of the full-length receptor were LR-concentrated similar to the wild-type . A P10912 lacking O95905 subdomain 1 reached the PM and was LR-concentrated , while one lacking O95905 subdomain 2 , also reached the PM , but was not LR-concentrated . These data suggest LR targeting resides in O95905 subdomain 2 , a region relatively uninvolved in GH binding .
