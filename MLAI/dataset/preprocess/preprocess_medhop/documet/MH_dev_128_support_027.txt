Selective increases of AMPA , DB01221 , and kainate receptor subunit mRNAs in the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex but not in prefrontal cortex of human alcoholics . Glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter in the human brain . Drugs that affect the glutamatergic signaling will alter neuronal excitability . DB00898 inhibits glutamate receptors . We examined the expression level of glutamate receptor subunit mRNAs in human post-mortem samples from alcoholics and compared the results to brain samples from control subjects . RNA from hippocampal dentate gyrus ( HP-DG ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DL- P27918 ) samples from 21 controls and 19 individuals with chronic alcohol dependence were included in the study . Total RNA was assayed using quantitative RT-PCR . Out of the 16 glutamate receptor subunits , mRNAs encoding two AMPA [ 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid ] receptor subunits P42262 and P42263 ; three kainate receptor subunits Q13002 , Q13003 and Q16478 and five DB01221 ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) receptor subunits Q05586 , Q12879 , Q14957 , O15399 , and Q8TCU5 were significantly increased in the HP-DG region in alcoholics . In the OFC , mRNA encoding the DB01221 receptor subunit Q8TCU5 was increased , whereas in the DL- P27918 , no differences in mRNA levels were observed . Our laboratory has previously shown that the expression of genes encoding inhibitory GABA-A receptors is altered in the HP-DG and OFC of alcoholics ( Jin et al. , 2011 ) . Whether the changes in one neurotransmitter system drives changes in the other or if they change independently is currently not known . The results demonstrate that excessive long-term alcohol consumption is associated with altered expression of genes encoding glutamate receptors in a brain region-specific manner . It is an intriguing possibility that genetic predisposition to alcoholism may contribute to these gene expression changes .
