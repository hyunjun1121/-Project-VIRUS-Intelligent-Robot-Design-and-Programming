Role of cyclooxygenase-2 in the prolonged regulation of renal function . The role of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in the prolonged regulation of renal function was evaluated during changes in sodium intake and reduction of NO synthesis . It was evaluated in conscious dogs by administering a selective inhibitor ( nimesulide ) during 8 consecutive days . DB04743 administration to dogs with normal or high sodium load did not modify glomerular filtration rate but reduced renal blood flow ( 16 % ; P < 0.05 ) . The vasoconstriction elicited by P35354 inhibition was greater when NO production was inhibited because glomerular filtration rate decreased by > 25 % when nimesulide was administered to dogs with a reduced NO synthesis . During low sodium intake , P35354 inhibition elicited a decrease ( P < 0.05 ) of both glomerular filtration rate ( 34 % ) and renal blood flow ( 31 % ) . Sodium excretion only decreased ( P < 0.05 ) during the first day of P35354 inhibition in dogs with normal or high sodium load . The increase in plasma potassium levels elicited by P35354 inhibition was greater in dogs with low sodium intake and was enhanced when NO production was inhibited . This change in potassium was not secondary to a decrease in plasma aldosterone levels . The results of this study suggest that P35354 -derived metabolites ( 1 ) play a more important role in the long-term regulation of renal hemodynamic when sodium intake is low , ( 2 ) protect the renal vasculature from the vasoconstriction secondary to a reduction in NO , ( 3 ) are only acutely involved in regulating urinary sodium excretion , and ( 4 ) play a more important role in regulating plasma potassium concentration when NO synthesis is reduced .
