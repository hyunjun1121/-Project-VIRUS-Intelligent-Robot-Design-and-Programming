Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 : a novel therapeutic target in necrotizing enterocolitis . Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is the most common gastrointestinal disease of infancy , afflicting 11 % of infants born 22-28 wk GA . Both inflammation and oxidation may be involved in NEC pathogenesis through reactive nitrogen species production , protein oxidation , and DNA damage . Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) is a critical enzyme activated to facilitate DNA repair using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) as a substrate . However , in the presence of severe oxidative stress and DNA damage , P09874 overactivation may ensue , depleting cells of NAD+ and DB00171 , killing them by metabolic catastrophe . Here , we tested the hypothesis that NO dysregulation in intestinal epithelial cells during NEC leads to marked P09874 expression and that administration of a P09874 inhibitor ( nicotinamide ) attenuates intestinal injury in a newborn rat model of NEC . In this model , 56 % of control pups developed NEC ( any stage ) versus 14 % of pups receiving nicotinamide . Forty-four percent of control pups developed high-grade NEC ( grades 3-4 ) , whereas only 7 % of pups receiving nicotinamide developed high-grade NEC . DB02701 treatment protects pups against intestinal injury incurred in the newborn rat NEC model . We speculate that P09874 overactivation in NEC may drive mucosal cell death in this disease and that P09874 may be a novel therapeutic target in NEC .
