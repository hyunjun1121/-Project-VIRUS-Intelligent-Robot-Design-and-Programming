The murine chemokine receptor P61073 is tightly regulated during T cell development and activation . We have characterized the murine homolog of the HIV-co-receptor P61073 during T cell development and activation . Our data demonstrate that this chemokine receptor , although highly conserved between human and mouse , is differently expressed and regulated in both species . Mitogenic activation resulted in an increase of surface P61073 on murine T cells within 2 days , whereas the receptor was strongly down-regulated on human T cells during this period . Furthermore , intraperitoneal immunization of mice resulted in a strong increase of splenic and mesenteric cytotoxic T cells co-expressing P61073 . It is interesting that , on thymocytes , expression of P61073 is restricted to P01730 +CD8+ cells . Stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha , a natural ligand of P61073 , induced chemotaxis of thymocytes and was found to counteract dexamethasone-induced apoptosis to a certain extent in these cells . Thus , our data show that expression of P61073 is tightly controlled on murine T cells and indicate that this highly conserved chemokine receptor might serve different functions in humans and mice .
