Mechanism of action of the bimodal antidepressant vilazodone : evidence for serotonin1A-receptor-mediated auto-augmentation of extracellular serotonin output . RATIONALE : The recently approved antidepressant vilazodone , a serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor partial agonist/selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor offers new possibilities to study the underlying mechanisms of depression pharmacotherapy and of 5-HT augmenting antidepressants . OBJECTIVE : The role of the P08908 receptor with respect to the regulation of 5-HT output in the mechanism of action of vilazodone . METHOD : We measured 5-HT levels in two subregions of the rat prefrontal cortex by microdialysis , and 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) accumulation and tissue 5-HT concentrations ex vivo . RESULTS : DB06684 -induced maximal 5-HT levels were similar in the medial and the lateral cortex and were up to sixfold higher than those induced by paroxetine , citalopram , or fluoxetine tested in parallel . Depolarization/autoreceptor-insensitive 5-HT release by vilazodone could be excluded . The citalopram ( 1 μM , locally infused ) -induced increase of 5-HT was further increased by vilazodone ( 1 mg/kg i.p. ) , but not by citalopram ( 10 mg/kg i.p. ) . Unlike fluoxetine , vilazodone-induced extracellular 5-HT output was not potentiated by cotreatment with the P08908 receptor blocker N-[2-(4-{2-methoxyphenyl}-1-piperazinyl)-ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide ( WAY 100635 ) . In contrast to fluoxetine , vilazodone exhibited intrinsic P08908 agonist activity : it reduced , similar to (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) , 5-HTP accumulation in striatum and n. raphe of reserpinized rats . Hence , vilazodone 's agonistic actions must be P08908 receptor-related since endogenous 5-HT is lacking in the reserpine-depleted animal . CONCLUSIONS : In spite of high intrinsic P08908 activity in reserpinized rats , the net effect of vilazodone at release-regulating P08908 autoreceptors must be inhibitory , leading to markedly increased 5-HT output . Another possibility is that vilazodone rapidly desensitizes autoinhibitory P08908 receptors by an unknown mechanism .
