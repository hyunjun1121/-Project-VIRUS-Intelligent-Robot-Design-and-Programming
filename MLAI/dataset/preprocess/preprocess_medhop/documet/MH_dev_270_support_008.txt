Interleukins 1α and 1β as regulators of steroidogenesis in human NCI-H295R adrenocortical cells . Inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis at several levels . Although hypothalamic P06850 secretion may be the primary mechanism by which these cytokines activate the Q9Y251 axis , IL-1 expression is increased within the adrenal glands in models for systemic inflammation , and IL-1 may augment adrenal glucocorticoid production . Our aim was to investigate the direct effects of IL-1α and IL-1β on adrenal steroidogenesis and expression of three key steroidogenic genes in human adrenocortical cells using the NCI-H295R cell line as a model . mRNAs encoding receptors for IL-1 , P01375 -α , and leukemia inhibitory factor ( P15018 ) were detectable in the cell line ( Affymetrix microarray analysis ) . Both IL-1α and IL-1β increased cortisol , androstenedione , dehydroepiandrosterone and DB05804 production , and the accumulation of mRNAs for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( STAR ) , 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase ( P05093 ) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 ( P26439 ) in these cells ( P < 0.05 for all ) . Both ILs augmented P01375 -α- and P15018 -induced STAR and P05093 mRNA accumulation , and P01375 -α-induced cortisol production ( P < 0.05 for all ) . Both ILs also increased the apoptotic index of the cells ( P < 0.05 ) , which was efficiently neutralized by their specific antibodies . The IL-induced changes in the STAR , P26439 , and P05093 protein levels were not as evident as those in the respective mRNA levels . In conclusion , the combined effect of inflammatory cytokines at the adrenal level in acute or chronic inflammatory states could significantly stimulate glucocorticoid production , and thus explain the observed discrepancy between the cortisol and DB01285 concentrations sometimes seen in sepsis and chronic inflammatory states .
