(+)- DB09061 analogues which bind cannabinoid receptors but exert peripheral activity only . Delta9- DB00470 ( Delta9-THC ) and (-)-cannabidiol are major constituents of the Cannabis sativa plant with different pharmacological profiles : (-)-Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol , but not (-)-cannabidiol , activates cannabinoid P21554 and CB2 receptors and induces psychoactive and peripheral effects . We have tested a series of (+)-cannabidiol derivatives , namely , (+)-cannabidiol- Q03001 ( Q03001 -1,1-dimethylheptyl- ) , (+)-7-OH-cannabidiol- Q03001 , (+)-7-OH- cannabidiol , (+)-7-COOH- cannabidiol and (+)-7-COOH-cannabidiol- Q03001 , for central and peripheral ( intestinal , antiinflammatory and peripheral pain ) effects in mice . Although all (+)-cannabidiols bind to cannabinoid P21554 and CB2 receptors , only (+)-7-OH-cannabidiol- Q03001 was centrally active , while all (+)-cannabidiol analogues completely arrested defecation . The effects of (+)-cannabidiol- Q03001 and (+)-7-OH-cannabidiol- Q03001 were partially antagonized by the cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist N-(piperidiny-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide ( SR141716 ) , but not by the cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist N- [ -(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethil bicyclo [ 2.2.1 ] heptan-2-yl-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide ( SR144528 ) , and had no effect on P21554 (-/-) receptor knockout mice . (+)- DB09061 - Q03001 inhibited the peripheral pain response and arachidonic-acid-induced inflammation of the ear . We conclude that centrally inactive (+)-cannabidiol analogues should be further developed as antidiarrheal , antiinflammatory and analgesic drugs for gastrointestinal and other peripheral conditions .
