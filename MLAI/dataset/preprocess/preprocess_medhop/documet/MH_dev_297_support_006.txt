Design and rationale for novel antifolates . The goals of new antifolate development are : 1 ) improved selectivity , 2 ) improved penetration into pharmacologic sanctuaries , and 3 ) effectiveness vs. tumors either with intrinsic or acquired resistance to methotrexate ( MTX ) . The major target for antifolate development has been dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , but other critical folate-dependent enzymes , i.e. , thymidylate synthase , methionine synthetase , and folylpolyglutamate synthetase are also important targets for new antifolate development . The possibility that P00374 from tumor tissue differs significantly from normal tissue P00374 now seems improbable , and the ideas of the late Bill Baker to design specific inhibitors of the tumor enzyme vs. the normal tissue P00374 are unlikely to succeed . However , the experience with triazinate ( Baker 's antifol ; TZT ) indicates that transport of antifols could be exploited to provide selective toxicity , as well as to provide agents effective vs. MTX-resistant cells . This work led to a second generation of " nonclassical " folate antagonists , of which trimetrexate ( JB-11 ; DB01157 ) is now in clinical trial . Uptake of DB01157 is via an MTX-independent membrane system , and extremely high intracellular levels of this drug are achieved in human leukemia cells .
