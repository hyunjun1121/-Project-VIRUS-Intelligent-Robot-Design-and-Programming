3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl bis-benzimidazole derivative , mitigates radiation-induced DNA damage . Radiation-induced DNA damage initiates a series of overlapping responses that include DNA damage recognition and repair , induction of cell cycle checkpoints , senescence and/or apoptosis . This study assessed the DNA damage response and whole genome expression profile in two mammalian cell lines ( P29320 and U87 ) in response to ( 5-{4-methylpiperazin-1-yl}-2-[2'-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5'-benzimidazolyl] benzimidazole ) P28067 and ionizing radiation . P28067 has been shown to act as a potent radiation protector , yielding significant levels of protection , i.e. , 20.9 % in P29320 cells and 21.2 % in U87 cells . Our findings revealed treatment with P28067 significantly reduced Î³- P16104 , Q12888 and Rad51 foci formation after irradiation . Q96HU1 kinase , WNT signaling and p53 pathways were found to be activated in P28067 -treated cells . In addition , the DNA damage response genes , HSP70 , P10809 , Q06830 , Q9BXM0 , P27797 , P06748 , P0CG48 , and Q01105 showed differential regulation in P28067 , P28067 + radiation and radiation-treated cells . The data suggest that P28067 -influenced repertoire of repair proteins , which are an indispensable part of the cell , interplay with each other to reduce DNA damage and maintain the genomic integrity of the cell .
