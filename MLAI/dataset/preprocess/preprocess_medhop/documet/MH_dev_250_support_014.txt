Interactome mapping of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway identifies deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 as a new glycogen synthase kinase-3 interactor . The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin ( PI3K- P42345 ) pathway plays pivotal roles in cell survival , growth , and proliferation downstream of growth factors . Its perturbations are associated with cancer progression , type 2 diabetes , and neurological disorders . To better understand the mechanisms of action and regulation of this pathway , we initiated a large scale yeast two-hybrid screen for 33 components of the PI3K- P42345 pathway . Identification of 67 new interactions was followed by validation by co-affinity purification and exhaustive literature curation of existing information . We provide a nearly complete , functionally annotated interactome of 802 interactions for the PI3K- P42345 pathway . Our screen revealed a predominant place for glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) A and B and the AMP-activated protein kinase . In particular , we identified the deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 ( O75398 ) transcription factor as an interactor and in vitro substrate of P49840 and P49841 . Moreover , GSK3 inhibitors increased O75398 transcriptional activity on the P08908 serotonin receptor promoter . We propose that O75398 may represent a therapeutic target of lithium and other GSK3 inhibitors used in bipolar disease and depression .
