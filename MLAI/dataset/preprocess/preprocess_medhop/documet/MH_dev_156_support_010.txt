Identification of the prostacyclin receptor by use of [15-3H1]19-(3-azidophenyl)-20-norisocarbacyclin , an irreversible specific photoaffinity probe . The prostaglandin I ( DB01240 ) receptor of mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells was characterized by photo-affinity labeling with the stable DB01240 analogue [ 15-3H1 ] -19-(3-azidophenyl)-20-norisocarbacyclin ( [ 3H ] APNIC ) used as a potential photoaffinity probe for the receptor . [3H]APNIC bound to the mastocytoma membrane with high affinity and in a saturable manner . Scatchard plot analysis indicated a single binding site with a Kd of 4.7 nM and a Bmax of 0.58 pmol/mg protein . The binding of [3H]APNIC was dose dependently inhibited by APNIC and iloprost , another stable DB01240 agonist , and to a much lesser extent by DB00917 . The binding of the radioligand showed sensitivity to the guanine nucleotide guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate) ( GTP gamma S ) . Photolysis of [3H]APNIC-prelabeled membranes resulted in incorporation of radiolabel into a protein of approximately 43 kDa . Photolabeling was inhibited by DB01240 agonists and other prostaglandins with specificity for the P43119 and was modulated by GTP gamma S . A protein of approximately 45 kDa was also labeled by [3H]APNIC in the membrane of porcine platelets , membranes that are known to be abundant in DB01240 receptors . These results demonstrate that [3H]APNIC specifically labels a protein that may represent the P43119 and that this radioprobe will be a useful reagent for further characterization and purification of the P43119 .
