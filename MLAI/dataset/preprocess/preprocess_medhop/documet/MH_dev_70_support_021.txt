[ HPV caused pathological changes in genital system of mice ] . The recombined adenovirus DNA was transfected into 293 cells for packing and amplification of replication-deficient Ad-CMV-E6/E7 , Ad- P02533 -E6/E7 virus was purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation , recombined adenovirus Ad-CMV-E6/E7 , Ad- P02533 -E6/E7 were used as experimental group , while pAd-CMV and pAdtrack- P02533 were used as control group . Four of them were injected through one main vein of nude mice tail respectively . These mice were then treated with 0.05 mg 17beta-estradiol over 12 weeks . Mice were anaesthesiaed with 2.5 % Avertint and the vagina , mammary gland , ovaries and uterus were dissected and fixed in 3.75 % paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 degrees C . Paraffin-embedded sections , HE staining and identification of P04637 and Bcl-2 protein via immunohistochemistry were performed . The expression of E6/E7 was verified by RT-PCR in different tissue of nude mice . HE staining showed evident hyperplasy in cervix-uterus transformation zone of experimental group 2 . The expression of mutant P04637 and Bcl-2 were higher than control group via immunohistochemical S-P method in uterus stroma-cell . Western blotting also showed that E6 protein was expressed . The expression of E6/E7 was higher than control group by human cytokeratin promoter 14 and hyperlasy changes were detected in epithelial tissue of cervix-uterus transformation zone .
