Genetics and alcoholism . DB00898 is widely consumed ; however , excessive use creates serious physical , psychological and social problems and contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases . DB00898 use disorders ( that is , alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse ) are maladaptive patterns of excessive drinking that lead to serious problems . Abundant evidence indicates that alcohol dependence ( alcoholism ) is a complex genetic disease , with variations in a large number of genes affecting a person 's risk of alcoholism . Some of these genes have been identified , including two genes involved in the metabolism of alcohol ( P00325 and P05091 ) that have the strongest known affects on the risk of alcoholism . Studies continue to reveal other genes in which variants affect the risk of alcoholism or related traits , including P47869 , P08172 , P48051 and Q8WXX7 . As more variants are analysed and studies are combined for meta-analysis to achieve increased sample sizes , an improved picture of the many genes and pathways that affect the risk of alcoholism will be possible .
