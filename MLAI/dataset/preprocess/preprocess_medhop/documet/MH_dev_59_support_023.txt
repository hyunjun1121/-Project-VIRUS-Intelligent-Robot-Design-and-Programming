Genetic polymorphisms associated with DB00544 -induced neurotoxicity . BACKGROUND : Encephalopathy is a rare drug toxicity of fluorouracil therapy . Toxicity from fluorouracil therapy is known to be associated with the individual genetic background of the enzymes , thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase . METHODS : Two patients with advanced gastric cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer who received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy presented with acute mental change and hyperammonemia . To evaluate the genetic background of the fluorouracil-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy , analysis of the polymorphisms of the P04818 , Q12882 and P42898 genes was performed . RESULTS : The patients revealed to be P04818 suppressors showing homogenous deletion of 6 bp in the 3'-UTR and 3RC/3RC genotype in the promoter enhancer region ( TSER ) , respectively . CONCLUSION : Genetic polymorphisms of the P04818 gene would contribute to the 5-fluorouracil-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy . The prospective validation of the clinical implication of P04818 gene polymorphisms is warranted .
