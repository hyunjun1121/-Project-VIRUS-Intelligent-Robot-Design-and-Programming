Cannabinoid 1 receptor-dependent transactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 emanates from lipid rafts and amplifies extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation in embryonic cortical neurons . G-protein coupled receptors may mediate their effects on neuronal growth and differentiation through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) , often elicited by transactivation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases . This elaborate signaling process includes inducible formation and trafficking of multiprotein signaling complexes and is facilitated by pre-ordained membrane microdomains , in particular lipid rafts . In this study , we have uncovered novel signaling interactions of cannabinoid receptors with fibroblast growth factor receptors , which depended on lipid rafts and led to P27361 /2 activation in primary neurons derived from chick embryo telencephalon . More specifically , the cannabinoid 1 receptor ( CB1R ) agonist methanandamide induced tyrosine phosphorylation and transactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 via Src and Fyn , which drove an amplification wave in P27361 /2 activation . Transactivation of P11362 was accompanied by the formation of a protein kinase C Îµ-dependent multiprotein complex that included CB1R , Fyn , Src , and P11362 . Recruitment of molecules increased with time of exposure to methanandamide , suggesting that in addition to signaling it also served trafficking of receptors . Upon agonist stimulation we also detected a rapid incorporation of CB1R , as well as activated Src and Fyn , and P11362 in lipid rafts . Most importantly , lipid raft integrity was a pre-requisite for CB1R-dependent complex formation . Our data provide evidence that lipid rafts may organize P21554 receptor proximal signaling events , namely activation of Src and Fyn , and transactivation of P11362 towards activation of P27361 /2 and induction of neuronal differentiation .
