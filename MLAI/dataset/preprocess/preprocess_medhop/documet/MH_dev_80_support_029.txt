A DNA vaccine against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 ( P16410 ) prevents tumor growth . Co-stimulatory signaling pathway triggered by the binding of P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 ( P33681 /86 ) of antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) to P10747 of T cells is required for optimal T-cell activation . Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ( P16410 ) is a negative regulator of T cell activation , which competes with P10747 for P33681 .1/ P33681 .2 binding with a greater affinity . DB06186 , a monoclonal antibody against P16410 , has shown positive efficacy in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and was approved by FDA . However , the cost of monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics might limit the number of patients treated . To develop a novel therapeutics specifically targeting P16410 , we constructed a DNA vaccine by cloning the sequence of P16410 fused with a transmembrane domain sequence of placental alkaline phosphatase ( PLAP ) into a mammalian expression plasmid , pVAC-1 . Immunization with the resulting construct , pVAC-1-hCTLA-4 , elicited antibody specific to human P16410 with cross reactivity to murine P16410 , which was sufficient for inhibiting B16F10 tumor growth in c57BL/6 mice in the absence of measurable toxicity . Coupling liposome with pVAC-1-mCTLA-4 could break tolerance to self-antigen in BALB/c mice and induce potent immunity against murine P16410 , and suppress growth of subcutaneous renal cell carcinoma ( Renca ) .
