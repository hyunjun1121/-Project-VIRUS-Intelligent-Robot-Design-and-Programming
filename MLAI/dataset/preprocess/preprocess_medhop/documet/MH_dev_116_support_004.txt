Constitutive high-level production of human lymphotoxin by CHO- P04264 cells transformed with the human lymphotoxin gene controlled by a human beta-actin promoter . To achieve high-level production of human lymphotoxin ( hLT ) , a plasmid ( p beta LT-ldhfr ) containing the hLT genomic DNA , a mouse dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) cDNA , and a bacterial Ecogpt gene was cotransfected with a plasmid ( p beta LTML ) encoding only the hLT genomic DNA into Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO- P04264 ) cells at a 1:7 molar ratio . Subsequently one of the Ecogpt-positive clones ( clone A31 ) was grown in stepwise increasing concentrations of methotrexate ( MTX ) . A large amount of the hLT was secreted by cells resistant to increased levels of MTX as a result of coamplification of the P00374 cDNA and the hLT gene . A cell clone ( clone M-1 ) resistant to up to 500 nM MTX constitutively expressed the hLT at a concentration of 80 micrograms per ml at an elevated level for about 2 months . The hLT was produced in glycosylated form the molecular mass of which was 23,000 daltons and the mRNA was normally spliced , so the protein molecules were probably homogeneous .
