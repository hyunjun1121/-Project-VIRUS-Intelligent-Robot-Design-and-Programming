Real-time DNA binding measurements of the P14921 recombinant oncoproteins reveal significant kinetic differences between the Q8NFH3 and Q9H3D4 isoforms . The sequence-specific DNA binding of recombinant Q8NFH3 and Q9H3D4 P14921 oncoprotein was examined quantitatively to determine whether the loss of the Exon VII phosphorylation domain in Q8NFH3 P14921 or the phosphorylation of expressed Exon VII in Q9H3D4 P14921 had an effect on DNA binding activity . The kinetics of sequence-specific DNA binding was measured using real-time changes in surface plasmon resonance with BIAcore ( registered trademark , Pharmacia Biosensor ) technology . The real-time binding of Q8NFH3 and Q9H3D4 P14921 displayed significant differences in kinetic behavior . Q9H3D4 P14921 is characterized by a fast initial binding and conversion to a stable complex , whereas Q8NFH3 P14921 exhibits a slow initial binding and conversion to a stable complex . All of the Q9H3D4 P14921 DNA binding states are characterized by rapid turnover , whereas the Q8NFH3 P14921 DNA binding states are 4-20 times more stable . A model describing these kinetic steps is presented . Stoichiometric titrations of either Q8NFH3 or Q9H3D4 P14921 with specific oligonucleotides show 1:1 complex formation . The DNA sequence specificity of the Q8NFH3 and Q9H3D4 P14921 as determined by mutational analysis was similar . The in vitro phosphorylation of Q9H3D4 P14921 by P62158 kinase II obliterates its binding to specific DNA , suggesting that the regulation of Q9H3D4 P14921 sequence-specific DNA binding occurs through phosphorylation by a calcium-dependent second messenger . The Q8NFH3 P14921 lacks this regulatory domain ( Exon VII ) , and binding to its specific DNA sequence is not sensitive to calcium signaling .
