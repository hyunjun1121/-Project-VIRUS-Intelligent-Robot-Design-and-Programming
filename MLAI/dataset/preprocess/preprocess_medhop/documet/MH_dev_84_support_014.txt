The Kv2.1 K+ channel targets to the axon initial segment of hippocampal and cortical neurons in culture and in situ . BACKGROUND : The Kv2.1 delayed-rectifier K+ channel regulates membrane excitability in hippocampal neurons where it targets to dynamic cell surface clusters on the soma and proximal dendrites . In the past , Kv2.1 has been assumed to be absent from the axon initial segment . RESULTS : Transfected and endogenous Kv2.1 is now demonstrated to preferentially accumulate within the axon initial segment ( AIS ) over other neurite processes ; 87 % of 14 DIV hippocampal neurons show endogenous channel concentrated at the AIS relative to the soma and proximal dendrites . In contrast to the localization observed in pyramidal cells , Q99259 positive inhibitory neurons within the hippocampal cultures did not show AIS targeting . Photoactivable-GFP-Kv2.1-containing clusters at the AIS were stable , moving < 1 microm/hr with no channel turnover . Photobleach studies indicated individual channels within the cluster perimeter were highly mobile ( P42345 tau=10.4+/-4.8 sec ) , supporting our model that Kv2.1 clusters are formed by the retention of mobile channels behind a diffusion-limiting perimeter . Demonstrating that the AIS targeting is not a tissue culture artifact , Kv2.1 was found in axon initial segments within both the adult rat hippocampal P00915 , P00918 , and P07451 layers and cortex . CONCLUSION : In summary , Kv2.1 is associated with the axon initial segment both in vitro and in vivo where it may modulate action potential frequency and back propagation . Since transfected Kv2.1 initially localizes to the AIS before appearing on the soma , it is likely multiple mechanisms regulate Kv2.1 trafficking to the cell surface .
