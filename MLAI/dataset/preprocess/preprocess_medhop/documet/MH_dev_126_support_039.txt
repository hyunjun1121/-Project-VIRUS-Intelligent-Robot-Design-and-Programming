Glioblastoma : synergy of growth promotion between P13501 and P25103 can be thwarted by blocking P13501 with miraviroc , an FDA approved anti-HIV drug and blocking P25103 with aprepitant , an FDA approved anti-nausea drug . WHAT IS KNOWN AND BACKGROUND : Two receptor signaling pathways that are commonly active in facilitating glioblastoma growth and invasion- that of P51681 and neurokinin ( NK ) -1R- have small molecule inhibitors that are FDA approved and marketed to treat other conditions . The anti-HIV drug , maraviroc , inhibits human P51681 's ligand from binding , and hence blocks P51681 stimulation . The anti-nausea drug aprepitant blocks DB05875 signaling at P25103 . AIMS AND OBJECTIVE : We propose on the basis of molecular insights that a combination of the two drugs is likely to be useful in the treatment of glioblastoma . COMMENT : After stimulation by their respective ligands both P51681 and P25103 , through intermediaries , phosphorylate and thereby activate P27361 /2 , triggering in turn migratory and mitotic events . Neurokinin-1R second messenger signaling also happens to serine phosphorylate P51681 . Phosphorylated P51681 exhibits amplified activity after agonist ligation . Therefore , aprepitant and maraviroc combined treatment is expected to exert synergestic inhibition of growth enhancing signaling in glioblastoma . Inhibiting an amplifier is equivalent to amplifying an inhibitor . Since the two suggested drugs are non-cytotoxic they are envisioned as adjunctive treatments to current standard temozolomide , radiation , and bevacizumab , all to be used after debulking primary resection . WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION : Our analysis makes the case for a well-designed trial of the proposed combination in the treatment of glioblastoma .
