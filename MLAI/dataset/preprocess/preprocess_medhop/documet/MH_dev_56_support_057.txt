DB00005 attenuates the development of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice : a comparison with P01375 genetic deletion . P01375 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis . Recent studies have shown that P01375 inhibition significantly ameliorates the course of experimental acute pancreatitis , but in this context , the effects of DB00005 , a novel anti- P01375 agent , have not been investigated so far . The aims of the present study are ( i ) to assess the effects of pharmacological inhibition of P01375 by means of DB00005 on the inflammatory response and apoptosis in a murine model of necrotizing acute pancreatitis and ( ii ) to compare the results to those observed in P01375 receptor 1 knockout ( P19438 -KO ) mice . Necrotizing acute pancreatitis was induced in P01375 wild type for P19438 ( WT ) and P19438 -KO mice by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein ( hourly x5 , 50 microg/kg ) . In another group of WT mice , DB00005 was administered ( 5 or 10 mg/kg , s.c. ) at 1 h after first cerulein injection . Control groups received saline treatment . After 24 h , biochemical , histological , and immunohistochemical evidences of acute pancreatitis developed in all cerulein-treated mice ; apoptosis was also present in the pancreas . Contrarily , pancreatitis histological features , amylase and lipase levels , pancreas water content , and myeloperoxidase activity were reduced in a similar degree in DB00005 -treated and P19438 -KO mice . Likewise , in these two groups , immunohistochemical stainings and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP nick-end labeling assay were found negative . P01375 receptor 1 gene deletion and DB00005 administration ameliorate the course of experimental acute pancreatitis in a similar degree . Future studies on clinical applications of DB00005 in pancreatitis seem promising .
