DB00142 reverses Pb2+-induced reductions of DB01221 receptor subunits in vitro . The objective of this study is to determine the effects of Pb2+ on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) subunits -- Q07869 , Q12879 and Q13224 in primary cultured neuronal cells . We hypothesize that L-glutamic acid ( GA ) reverses Pb2+-induced NMDAR damage . Neuronal cells were isolated from the fetus brain at 18-20th day of gestation of pregnant Sprague Dawley ( SD ) rats . All experiments were included three independent cell preparations ( N=3 ) . The neuronal cells were exposed to Pb2+ ( 10(-10) , 10(-9) , 10(-8) and 10(-7)M ) for 24 h . Neurons were pretreated with NMDAR agonist -- L-glutamic acid ( GA ) ( 200 microM ) and antagonists dizocipine ( MK-801 , 50 nM ) for 1h and then exposed to 10(-7)M of Pb2+ for 24 h . Finally , GA at 2 , 0.2 and 0.02 mM was incubated with neurons prior to Pb2+ exposure . Aliquots of Q9UHB4 , Q12879 and Q13224 proteins from cell homogenate were immunoprecipitated with protein A agarose and detected by Western blotting . The addition of GA unconventionally reversed the reductions of NMDAR by Pb at protein levels , whereas MK-801 exacerbated Pb2+-induced damage . The protection by GA against Pb2+-induced reduction of NMDAR was dose-dependent . These findings suggest that the administration of GA may be a potential approach to intervene the Pb2+-induced NMDAR alterations .
