Novel antiangiogenic pathway of thrombospondin-1 mediated by suppression of the cell cycle . We have recently reported that keratin 14-promoter-driven vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -E(NZ-7) transgenic mice have a significant number of capillary vessels in subcutaneous tissue . However , these vessels are generated in a layer some distance from the epithelial basal cells that express Q9NRA1 (NZ-7) , suggesting that one or more antiangiogenenic molecules may exist very near the basal cell layer . By screening keratinocyte-conditioned medium , we found that thrombospondin-1 ( P07996 -1 ) is produced from keratinocytes and suppresses human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) growth as well as tubular formation in a HUVEC-fibroblast coculture system . Different to the known mechanism of P16671 -dependent endothelial cell apoptosis , the HUVEC we used did not express P16671 at detectable levels , indicating a new mechanism for P07996 -1-induced antiangiogenesis . We found that P07996 -1 induces little apoptosis of endothelial cells but causes cell-cycle arrest , increasing the amounts of P38936 (CIP/WAF-1) and unphosphorylated retinoblastoma ( Rb ) in HUVEC . P16671 -binding peptide in P07996 -1 and P16671 -neutralizing antibody did not block the P07996 -1-induced cell-cycle arrest . Our results strongly suggest that P07996 -1 utilizes a novel pathway for its antiangiogenic effect independent of P16671 , and suppresses the cell cycle .
