Evidence of in vitro differential secretion of 72 and 92 kDa type IV collagenases after selective exposure to lipopolysaccharide in human fetal membranes . Premature rupture of chorioamniotic membranes complicated with intrauterine infection has been associated to degradation of extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) , which could explain local morphological changes . We used a culture system in which the chorioamniotic membranes form two independent chambers , allowing for the selective stimulation of either the amnion ( Q9BXJ7 ) and/or the choriodecidua ( Q8NE62 ) regions . Lipopolysaccharide ( 500 ng/ml ) was added to the Q9BXJ7 and/or the Q8NE62 ; secretions and gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 and P14780 were measured in both compartments by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and zymography . Secretions of P01033 , P16035 and Q99727 were measured by ELISA . Both metalloproteinases were immunolocalized in tissue sections . All stimulation modalities induced a similar proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 secretion pattern in the Q8NE62 with concentrations of 2.49 ng/ml and 90.91 pg/ml , respectively ; the Q9BXJ7 showed no significant changes . The active forms of both enzymes did not change with any stimulation modality . P01033 , P16035 and Q99727 secretions remained without significant changes ( P = 0.41 ) . Q13201 degradation and structural disarrangement were evident after stimulation . Secretion of proMMP-2 and proMMP-9 mainly in the Q8NE62 , presence of active forms associated to the tissue and minor changes in TIMPs secretion could favor Q13201 degradation and explain the weakening and thinning associated with the pathological rupture of chorioamniotic membranes .
