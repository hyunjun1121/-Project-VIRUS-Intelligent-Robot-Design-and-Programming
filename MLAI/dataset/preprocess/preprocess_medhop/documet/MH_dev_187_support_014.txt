Comparative P15692 receptor tyrosine kinase modeling for the development of highly specific inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis . The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptors ( P15692 -Rs ) play a significant role in tumor development and tumor angiogenesis and are therefore interesting targets in cancer therapy . Targeting the P15692 -R is of special importance as the feed of the tumor has to be reduced . In general , this can be carried out by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase function of the P15692 -R . Nevertheless , there arise some problems with the specificity of known kinase inhibitors : they bind to the DB00171 -binding site and inhibit a number of kinases , moreover the so far most specific inhibitors act at least on these three major types of P15692 -Rs : Flt-1 , Flk-1/ P35968 , Flt-4 . The goal is a selective P15692 -R-2 ( Flk-1/ P35968 ) inhibitor , because this receptor triggers rather unspecific signals from P15692 , -C , -D and -E . Here , we describe a protocol starting from an established inhibitor ( DB04879 ) with 2D-/3D-searching and property filtering of the in silico screening hits and the " negative docking approach " . With this approach we were able to identify a compound , which shows a fourfold higher reduction of the proliferation rate of endothelial cells compared to the reduction effect of the lead structure .
