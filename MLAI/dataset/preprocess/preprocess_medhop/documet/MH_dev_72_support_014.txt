[ The interconnections of molecular mechanisms of hormone actions and their role in pathogenesis of obesity , insulin resistance , and diabetes mellitus ] . The various hormones , proteins and other compounds related to developing obesity , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are analyzed in the paper . 1 ) Leptin , ciliary neurutrophic factor , adiponectin , glucagon-like peptide 1 , peptide YY , neuromedin S , as well as the protein receptors of these hormones decrease the food consumption , increase the energy turnover , and prevent obesity , insulin resistance , and type 2 diabetes development . The mediators of these hormone and receptor actions are melanocyte stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) , and the others . 2 ) Ghrelin , endogenose cannabinoides , galanin-like peptide and the mediators of their actions : neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) and Agouti gene related protein ( O00253 ) increase the appetite and food consumption . Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) performs the similar action on food intake . The activation of the first group compound functioning decreases the obesity , increases the energy turnover , facilitates the insulin action and prevents the insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . Increasing the activities of the second group , as well as , decreasing the actions of the first one of substances induce the opposite effects and facilitate obesity , insulin resistance , and type 2 diabetes developments . The interconnections of the molecular mechanisms of so many hormone actions make the very complicated tusk to study the various endocrine disorders including diabetes mellitus as well .
