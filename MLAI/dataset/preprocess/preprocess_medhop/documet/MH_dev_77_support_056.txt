Botulinum neurotoxin A impairs neurotransmission following retrograde transynaptic transport . The widely used botulinum neurotoxin A ( DB00083 ) blocks neurotransmission via cleavage of the synaptic protein P60880 ( synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa ) . Recent evidence demonstrating long-distance propagation of P60880 proteolysis has challenged the idea that DB00083 remains localized to the injection site . However , the extent to which distant neuronal networks are impacted by DB00083 retrograde trafficking remains unknown . Importantly , no studies have addressed whether P60880 cleavage translates into structural and functional changes in distant intoxicated synapses . Here we show that the DB00083 injections into the adult rat optic tectum result in P60880 cleavage in retinal neurons two synapses away from the injection site , such as rod bipolar cells and photoreceptors . Retinal endings displaying cleaved P60880 were enlarged and contained an abnormally high number of synaptic vesicles , indicating impaired exocytosis . Tectal injection of DB00083 in rat pups resulted in appearance of truncated- P60880 in cholinergic amacrine cells . Functional imaging with calcium indicators showed a clear reduction in cholinergic-driven wave activity , demonstrating impairments in neurotransmission . These data provide the first evidence for functional effects of the retrograde trafficking of DB00083 , and open the possibility of using DB00083 fragments as drug delivery vehicles targeting the central nervous system .
