Autocrine signaling via release of DB00171 and activation of Q99572 receptor influences motile activity of human lung cancer cells . Extracellular nucleotides , such as DB00171 , are released from cells and play roles in various physiological and pathological processes through activation of P2 receptors . Here , we show that autocrine signaling through release of DB00171 and activation of Q99572 receptor influences migration of human lung cancer cells . Release of DB00171 was induced by stimulation with TGF-β1 , which is a potent inducer of cell migration , in human lung cancer H292 cells , but not in noncancerous BEAS-2B cells . Treatment of H292 cells with a specific antagonist of Q99572 receptor resulted in suppression of TGF-β1-induced migration . PC-9 human lung cancer cells released a large amount of DB00171 under standard cell culture conditions , and Q99572 receptor-dependent dye uptake was observed even in the absence of exogenous ligand , suggesting constitutive activation of Q99572 receptor in this cell line . PC-9 cells showed high motile activity , which was inhibited by treatment with ecto-nucleotidase and Q99572 receptor antagonists , whereas a Q99572 receptor agonist enhanced migration . PC-9 cells also harbor a constitutively active mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . Treatment with P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 suppressed both cell migration and Q99572 receptor expression in PC-9 cells . Compared to control PC-9 cells , cells treated with Q99572 antagonist exhibited broadened lamellipodia around the cell periphery , while AG1478-treated cells lacked lamellipodia . These results indicate that Q99572 -mediated signaling and P00533 signaling may regulate migration of PC-9 cells through distinct mechanisms . We propose that autocrine DB00171 - Q99572 signaling is involved in migration of human lung cancer cells through regulation of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement .
