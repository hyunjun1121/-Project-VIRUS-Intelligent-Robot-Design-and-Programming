The expression of retinoblastoma and Sp1 is increased by low concentrations of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors . We examined the effect of suboptimal concentrations of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors , which do not interfere with cell proliferation , on retinoblastoma expression in hamster ( Chinese hamster ovary P04264 ) and human ( K562 and HeLa ) cells . To achieve this , we used the chemical inhibitors roscovitine and olomoucine ( which inhibit P24941 preferentially ) , P55089 -01 ( which also inhibits P11802 /6 ) and P38936 ( as an intrinsic inhibitor ) . All chemical inhibitors and overexpression of P38936 strongly induced retinoblastoma protein expression . P55089 -01-mediated retinoblastoma expression was caused by an increase in both the levels of retinoblastoma mRNA and the stability of the protein . The expression of the transcription factor Sp1 , a retinoblastoma-interacting protein , was also enhanced by all the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors tested . However , Sp1 expression was caused by an increase in the levels of Sp1 mRNA without modification in the stability of the protein . By using luciferase experiments , the transcriptional activation of both retinoblastoma and Sp1 promoters by P55089 -01 was confirmed . Bisindolylmaleimide I , at concentrations causing a similar or higher inhibition of protein kinase C than P55089 -01 , provoked a lower activation of retinoblastoma and Sp1 expression . Finally , the effects of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors on dihydrofolate reductase gene expression were evaluated . Treatment with P55089 -01 increased cellular dihydrofolate reductase mRNA levels , and dihydrofolate reductase enzymatic activity was enhanced by P55089 -01 , roscovitine , olomoucine and P38936 , in transient transfection experiments . These results support a mechanism for the self-regulation of retinoblastoma expression , and point to the need to establish the appropriate dose of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as antiproliferative agents in anticancer treatments .
