Proinflammatory cytokines downregulate gene expression and activity of constitutive nitric oxide synthase in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells . We evaluated the effects of cytokines on the catalytic activity and expression of porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cell ( PAEC ) constitutive ( P29474 ) and inducible ( P35228 ) isoforms of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) . Exposure of PAEC to the combination of P01579 , P01375 , and P01584 did not alter P35228 activity in cytosolic and membrane fractions but significantly ( p < 0.01 ) reduced P29474 activity in the membrane fraction , but not in the cytosolic fraction , after a 24-h exposure . The cytokine-induced loss of membrane fraction P29474 activity was associated with significant reductions of P29474 mRNA and protein content ( p < 0.01 for both ) . Treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , but not the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D prevented cytokine-induced reduction of P29474 mRNA expression . These results suggest that cytokine-induced loss of catalytic activity of P29474 is associated with a reduction in P29474 mRNA and protein mass and that cytokines alter P29474 mRNA stability . Inhibition of protein synthesis prevented reduction of P29474 mRNA by cytokines , suggesting that the mechanism by which cytokines alter P29474 mRNA stability involves protein synthesis .
