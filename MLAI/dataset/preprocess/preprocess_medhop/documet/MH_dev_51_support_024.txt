Antagonism of endothelin action normalizes altered levels of P15692 and its signaling in the brain of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat . Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRSP ) often suffer from spontaneous stroke , in part , due to abnormalities in the cerebrovasculature . Here , we investigate the profile of key angiogenic factors and their basic signaling molecules in the brain of SHRSP during the age-dependent stages of hypertension . The profile of P15692 and its receptor , Flk-1 , was dependent on age and stage of hypertension ( i.e. , down regulated at pre-hypertensive and malignant hypertensive stages , but up regulated at typical hypertensive stage ) , while that of its downstream components , pAkt and P29474 , were down regulated in a time-dependent manner in the frontal cortex of SHRSP compared to age-matched genetic control , normotensive WKY rats . On the other hand , the expression of endothelin-1 and its type A receptor ( endothelin P25101 receptor ) were up regulated , depending on age and stage of hypertension . In contrast , levels of endothelin type B receptor were down regulated . The regional cerebral blood flow decreased during the development of malignant hypertension . Thus , subsequent experiments were designed to investigate whether endothelin-1 receptor antagonism , using endothelin-A/-B dual receptor antagonist SB209670 , could normalize the molecular profile of these factors in SHRSP brain . Interestingly , blockage of endothelin-1 receptor restored to normal , levels of cerebral endothelin-1 , endothelin P25101 receptor and endothelin ETB receptor ; P15692 and Flk-1 ; endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) and pAkt , in SHRSP , compared to age-matched WKY . Endothelin receptor blocker might be important to prevent the progression in the defect in P15692 and its angiogenic signaling cascade in the pathogenesis of hypertension-induced vascular remodeling in frontal cortex of SHRSP rats .
