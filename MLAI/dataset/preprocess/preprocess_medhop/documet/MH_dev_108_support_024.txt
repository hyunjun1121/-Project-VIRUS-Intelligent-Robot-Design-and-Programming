Selective P01375 -α inhibitor-induced injection site reactions . INTRODUCTION : During the last decade , many new biological immune modulators entered the market as new therapeutic principles . P01375 -α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to a have a key role in the pathogenic mechanisms of various immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases . P01375 -α blockers have demonstrated efficacy in large , randomized controlled clinical trials either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs . AREAS COVERED : Although generally well tolerated and safe , potential adverse events may be associated with P01375 -α inhibitor treatment . The authors will briefly review the potential adverse drug reactions and the immunological mechanisms of injection site reactions ( ISRs ) in patients treated with etanercept and adalimumab . EXPERT OPINION : Patients treated with P01375 -α inhibitors can develop ISR around the sites of injections . ' Type IV delayed type reaction ' or ' recall ISRs ' . Eosinophilic cellulitis or ' Wells syndrome ' , ' type III ' and ' type I ' reactions are reported . Long-term studies are necessary to determine the durability of response and the real risk of ISRs with DB06674 and certolizumab pegol . Further studies are also necessary to evaluate the immunogenicity of these drugs .
