DB00072 has opposing effects on SN-38-induced double-strand breaks and cytotoxicity in P04626 -positive gastric cancer cells depending on administration sequence . AIM : We investigated the effects of trastuzumab , an anti- P04626 humanized monoclonal antibody , on DNA breaks induced by SN-38 , a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor , in gastric cancer cell lines positive or negative for P04626 expression . MATERIALS AND METHODS : NCI-N87 ( P04626 + ) and MKN74 ( P04626 - ) cells were exposed to SN-38 in the presence or absence of trastuzumab . DB00072 was added either prior to or after SN-38 . Effects of trastuzumab on the induction of gamma- P16104 , a marker of DNA double-strand breaks , the cytotoxicity of SN-38 and cell cycle progression were determined . RESULTS : When trastuzumab was administered following SN-38 , it increased γ P16104 levels and cytotoxicity of SN-38 in NCI-N87 cells , but not in MKN74 cells . In contrast , pretreatment with trastuzumab reduced SN-38-induced γ P16104 expression and cytotoxicity of SN-38 in NCI-N87 cells , but not in MKN74 cells . DB00072 delayed cell cycle progression in NCI-N87 cells only . CONCLUSION : DB00072 has opposing effects on SN-38-induced double-strand breaks and cytotoxicity depending on the order of administration of the two agents .
