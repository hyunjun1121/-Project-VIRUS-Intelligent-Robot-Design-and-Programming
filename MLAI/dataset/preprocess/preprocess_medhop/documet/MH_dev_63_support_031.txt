Population genomic analyses based on 1 million SNPs in commercial egg layers . Identifying signatures of selection can provide valuable insight about the genes or genomic regions that are or have been under selective pressure , which can lead to a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships . A common strategy for selection signature detection is to compare samples from several populations and search for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation . Wright 's fixation index , P19883 , is a useful index for evaluation of genetic differentiation between populations . The aim of this study was to detect selective signatures between different chicken groups based on SNP-wise P19883 calculation . A total of 96 individuals of three commercial layer breeds and 14 non-commercial fancy breeds were genotyped with three different 600K SNP-chips . After filtering a total of 1 million SNPs were available for P19883 calculation . Averages of P19883 values were calculated for overlapping windows . Comparisons of these were then conducted between commercial egg layers and non-commercial fancy breeds , as well as between white egg layers and brown egg layers . Comparing non-commercial and commercial breeds resulted in the detection of 630 selective signatures , while 656 selective signatures were detected in the comparison between the commercial egg-layer breeds . Annotation of selection signature regions revealed various genes corresponding to productions traits , for which layer breeds were selected . Among them were Q15788 , Q12772 and Q6GYQ0 associated with reproductive traits , broodiness and egg production . Furthermore , several of the detected genes were associated with growth and carcass traits , including P01189 , O43741 , P10451 , P01344 , P07384 , TGFb2 and P18065 . Our approach demonstrates that including different populations with a specific breeding history can provide a unique opportunity for a better understanding of farm animal selection .
