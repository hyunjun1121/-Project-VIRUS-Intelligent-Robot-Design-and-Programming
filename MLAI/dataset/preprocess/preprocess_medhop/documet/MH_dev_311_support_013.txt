Cutting edge : high molecular weight hyaluronan promotes the suppressive effects of P01730 +CD25+ regulatory T cells . DB08818 is a glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix . When hyaluronan is degraded during infection and injury , low m.w. forms are generated whose interactions influence inflammation and angiogenesis . Intact high m.w. hyaluronan , conversely , conveys anti-inflammatory signals . We demonstrate that high m.w. hyaluronan enhances human P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell functional suppression of responder cell proliferation , whereas low m.w. hyaluronan does not . High m.w. hyaluronan also up-regulates the transcription factor Q9BZS1 on P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells . These effects are only seen with activated P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells and are associated with the expression of P16070 isomers that more highly bind high m.w. hyaluronan . At higher concentrations , high m.w. hyaluronan also has direct suppressive effects on T cells . We propose that the state of HA in the matrix environment provides contextual cues to P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells and T cells , thereby providing a link between the innate inflammatory network and the regulation of adaptive immune responses .
