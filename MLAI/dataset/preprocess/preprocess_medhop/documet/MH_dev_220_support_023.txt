Cutting edge : resistance to apoptosis and continuous proliferation of dendritic cells deficient for P01375 receptor-1 . The individual roles of the two TNFRs on dendritic cells ( DC ) are poorly understood . Investigating bone marrow-derived DC from TNFR-deficient mice , we found that cultures from P19438 (-/-) mice continue to form proliferating clusters for 6-9 mo . In contrast , DC derived from wild-type , P20333 (-/-) , or P19438 /2(-/-) mice survived for only 3-4 wk . DC obtained from these P19438 (-/-) long term cultures ( LTC ) mice show an unusual mixed immature/mature phenotype . The continuous proliferation of the LTC is GM- P04141 dependent and correlates with decreased protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27( P46527 ) and P38936 (CIP1) . Prolonged survival of P19438 (-/-) DC appears to be independent from NF-kappaB and Bcl-2 pathways and is rather enabled by the down-regulation of CD95 , resulting in the resistance to P48023 -induced apoptosis . These data point to proapoptotic signals mediated via P19438 and antiapoptotic signals mediated via P20333 in DC .
