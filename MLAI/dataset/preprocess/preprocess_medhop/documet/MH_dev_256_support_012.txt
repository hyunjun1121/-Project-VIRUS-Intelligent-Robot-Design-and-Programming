Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway regulates tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor complex by phosphorylation of tuberin . Normal cellular functions of hamartin and tuberin , encoded by the Q92574 and P49815 tumor suppressor genes , are closely related to their direct interactions . However , the regulation of the hamartin-tuberin complex in the context of the physiologic role as tumor suppressor genes has not been documented . Here we show that insulin or insulin growth factor ( IGF ) 1 stimulates phosphorylation of tuberin , which is inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 but not by the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 . Expression of constitutively active PI3K or active Akt , including Akt1 and Akt2 , induces tuberin phosphorylation . We further demonstrate that Akt/ P31749 associates with hamartin-tuberin complexes , promoting phosphorylation of tuberin and increased degradation of hamartin-tuberin complexes . The ability to form complexes , however , is not blocked . Akt also inhibits tuberin-mediated degradation of p27(kip1) , thereby promoting P24941 activity and cellular proliferation . Our results indicate that tuberin is a direct physiological substrate of Akt and that phosphorylation of tuberin by PI3K/Akt is a major mechanism controlling hamartin-tuberin function .
