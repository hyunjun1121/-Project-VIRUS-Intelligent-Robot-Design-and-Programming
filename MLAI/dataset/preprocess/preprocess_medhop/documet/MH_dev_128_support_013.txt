Predicting the effect of naltrexone and acamprosate in alcohol-dependent patients using genetic indicators . DB00659 and naltrexone are effective medications in the treatment of alcoholism . However , effect sizes are modest . Pharmacogenomics may improve patient-treatment-matching and effect sizes . It is hypothesized that naltrexone exerts its effect through genetic characteristics associated with the dopaminergic/opioidergic positive reinforcement system , whereas acamprosate works through the glutamatergic/GABAergic negative reinforcement system . DB00898 -dependent subjects were randomly assigned to either acamprosate or naltrexone . Subjects participated in a cue-exposure experiment at the day before and at the last day of medication . Reductions in cue-induced craving and physiological cue reactivity were measured . Differential effects of naltrexone and acamprosate on these outcomes were tested for different polymorphisms of the opioid , dopamine , glutamate and GABA-receptors . Significant matching effects were found for polymorphisms at the P14416 , Q16445 and P47870 gene . In addition , a trend was found for the P35372 polymorphism . This provides evidence for the matching potential of genotypes . It is expected that more effective treatments can be offered when genetic information is used in patient-treatment-matching .
