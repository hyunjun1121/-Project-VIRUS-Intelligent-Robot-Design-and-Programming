Myeloid cell-specific serine palmitoyltransferase subunit 2 haploinsufficiency reduces murine atherosclerosis . DB00133 palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of sphingomyelin ( SM ) . Both P21549 and SM have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis , the development of which is driven by macrophages ; however , the role of P21549 in macrophage-mediated atherogenesis is unknown . To address this issue , we have analyzed macrophage inflammatory responses and reverse cholesterol transport , 2 key mediators of atherogenesis , in P21549 subunit 2-haploinsufficient ( Sptlc2(+/-) ) macrophages . We found that Sptlc2(+/-) macrophages have significantly lower SM levels in plasma membrane and lipid rafts . This reduction not only impaired inflammatory responses triggered by O00206 and its downstream NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways , but also enhanced reverse cholesterol transport mediated by ABC transporters . P01130 -deficient ( Ldlr(-/-) ) mice transplanted with Sptlc2(+/-) bone marrow cells exhibited significantly fewer atherosclerotic lesions after high-fat and high-cholesterol diet feeding . Additionally , Ldlr(-/-) mice with myeloid cell-specific Sptlc2 haploinsufficiency exhibited significantly less atherosclerosis than controls . These findings suggest that P21549 could be a novel therapeutic target in atherosclerosis .
