Polymorphisms of human histamine receptor H4 gene are associated with breast cancer in Chinese Han population . Previous investigations indicated that histamine receptor H4 ( Q9H3N8 ) played important roles in many aspects of breast cancer pathogenesis , and that the polymorphisms of Q9H3N8 gene may result in expression and functional changes of Q9H3N8 proteins . However , the relationship between polymorphisms of Q9H3N8 and breast cancer risk and malignant degree is unclear . In the present study , we conducted a case-control investigation among 185 Chinese Han breast cancer patients and 199 ethnicity-matched health controls . Four tag-SNPs ( i.e. rs623590 , rs16940762 , rs11662595 and rs1421125 ) of Q9H3N8 were genotyped and association analysis was performed . Odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were used to assess the association . We found that the T allele of rs623590 had a decreased risk of breast cancer ( adjusted OR , 0.667 ; 95 % CI , 0.486-0.913 ; P=0.012 ) while the A allele of rs1421125 had an increased risk ( adjusted OR , 1.653 ; 95 % CI , 1.139-2.397 ; P=0.008 ) . Further haplotype analysis showed that the CAA haplotype of rs623590-rs11662595-rs1421125 was more frequent among patients with breast cancer ( adjusted OR , 1.856 ; 95 % CI , 1.236-2.787 ; P=0.003 ) . Additionally , polymorphisms of rs623590 and rs11662595 were also correlated with clinical stages , lymph node involvement , and P04626 status . These findings indicated that the variants of rs623590 , rs11662595 and rs1421125 genotypes of Q9H3N8 gene were significantly associated with the risk and malignant degree of breast cancer in Chinese Han populations , which may provide us novel insight into the pathogenesis of breast cancer although further studies with larger participants worldwide are still needed for conclusion validation .
