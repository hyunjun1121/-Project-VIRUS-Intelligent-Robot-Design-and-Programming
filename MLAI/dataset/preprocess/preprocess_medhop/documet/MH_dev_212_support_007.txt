Inhibition of P04275 -mediated platelet activation and thrombosis by the anti- P04275 A1-domain aptamer DB05202 . BACKGROUND : P04275 ( P04275 ) has a role in both hemostasis and thrombosis . Platelets adhere to damaged arteries by interactions between the P04275 A1-domain and glycoprotein Ib receptors under conditions of high shear . This initial platelet binding event stimulates platelet activation , recruitment , and activation of the clotting cascade , promoting thrombus formation . OBJECTIVE : To characterize the inhibitory activity of a P04275 inhibitory aptamer . METHODS : Using in vitro selection , aptamer stabilization , and conjugation to a 20-kDa poly ( ethylene glycol ) , we generated a nuclease-resistant aptamer , DB05202 , that binds to the P04275 A1-domain with high affinity ( K(D) approximately 2 nM ) . The aptamer was assessed for inhibition of P04275 -induced platelet aggregation . In vitro inhibition of platelet adhesion was assessed on collagen-coated slides and injured pig aortic segments . In vivo activity was assessed in a cynomolgus monkey carotid electrical injury thrombosis model . RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : DB05202 inhibited botrocetin-induced platelet aggregation ( IC90 approximately 300 nM ) and shear force-induced platelet aggregation ( IC95 approximately 400 nM ) . It reduced adhesion of platelets to collagen-coated matrices and formation of platelet thrombi on denuded porcine arteries . DB05202 also inhibited the formation of occlusive thrombi in cynomolgus monkeys . We have discovered a novel anti- P04275 aptamer that could have therapeutic use as an anti- P04275 agent in the setting of P04275 -mediated thrombosis .
