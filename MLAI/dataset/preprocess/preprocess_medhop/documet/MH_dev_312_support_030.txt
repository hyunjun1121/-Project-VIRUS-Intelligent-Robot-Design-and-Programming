P01308 secretory defects and impaired islet architecture in pancreatic beta-cell-specific P40763 knockout mice . Normal islet formation and function depends on the action of various growth factors operating in pre- and postnatal development ; however , the specific physiological function of each factor is largely unknown . Loss-of-function analyses in mice have provided little information so far , perhaps due to functional redundancies of the growth factors acting on the pancreas . The present study focuses on the role of the transcription factor P40763 in insulin-producing cells . P40763 is one of the potential downstream mediators for multiple growth factors acting on the pancreatic beta-cells , including betacellulin , hepatocyte growth factor , growth hormone , and heparin-binding P01133 -like growth factor . To elucidate its role in the beta-cells , the P40763 gene was disrupted in insulin-producing cells in mice ( P40763 -insKO ) , using a cre-mediated gene recombination approach . Unexpectedly , P40763 -insKO mice exhibited an increase in appetite and obesity at 8 weeks of age or older . The mice showed partial leptin resistance , suggesting that expression of the RIP ( rat insulin promoter ) -cre transgene in hypothalamus partially inhibited the appetite-regulating system . Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests , performed in non-obese 5-week-old mice , showed that the P40763 -insKO mice were glucose intolerant . Islet perifusion experiments further revealed a deficiency in early-phase insulin secretion . Whereas islet insulin content or islet mass was not affected , expression levels of P11168 , Q09428 , and P15692 were significantly reduced in P40763 -insKO islets . Interestingly , P40763 -insKO mice displayed impaired islet morphology : alpha-cells were frequently seen in central regions of islets . Our present observations demonstrate a unique role of P40763 in maintaining glucose-mediated early-phase insulin secretion and normal islet morphology .
