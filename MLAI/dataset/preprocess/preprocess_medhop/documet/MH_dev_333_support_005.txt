The biology of serotonin receptors : focus on migraine pathophysiology and treatment . Serotonin receptors are highly heterogeneous and they have been regrouped within seven different families ( 5-HT1- P34969 ) . With the exception of the 5- Q9H205 which is a ligand-gated ion channel , all others are G-protein coupled receptors with each family sharing structural , pharmacological and transductional characteristics . 5-HT receptors have been implicated in the regulation of several psychiatric and neurological disorders related to serotonergic neurotransmission , and specific receptor subtypes have recently been associated with either the pathogenesis or the treatment of migraine headache . In this respect , activation of vascular P41595 and/or P34969 receptors , possibly as a consequence of the sudden rise in 5-HT levels reported at the onset of a migraine attack , would hypothetically result in dilation of cerebral blood vessels and concomitant activation of sensory trigeminovascular afferents , hence initiating the manifestation of head pain . At this stage in the migraine process , activation of specific subtypes of 5-HT1 receptors has proven clinically effective in relieving migraine pain . Neural P28221 and/or P30939 receptors localized pre-junctionally on trigeminovascular afferents appear to mediate the DB00669 -induced inhibition of the neurogenic inflammatory response , with possible additional sites of action for brain penetrant 5-HT1 receptor agonists in inhibiting the transmission of pain centrally . In contrast , activation of vascular P28222 receptors would constrict meningeal vessels hence recovering their pre-migraine diameter . The recent availability of subtype selective P28221 and P30939 receptor agonists should allow a further test of the neural/vascular hypothesis and could possibly lead to antimigraine drugs with a safer cardiovascular profile .
