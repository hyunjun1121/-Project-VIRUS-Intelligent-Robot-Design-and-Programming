P10275 mediates the expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 B15 and Q9NYP3 genes . BACKGROUND : Enhanced androgen receptor ( AR ) activity by increased testosterone availability may play important roles in prostate cancer progressing to castration resistant state . Comparison of expression profiles in androgen dependent and independent prostate tumors demonstrated a marked increase of the expression of P54855 ( P54855 ) , an androgen catabolic enzyme . We investigated mechanisms controlling the differential expression of P54855 and Q9NYP3 in response to androgen treatments . METHODS : Gene expression was determined by RT-PCR . The association of AR with P54855 / Q9NYP3 genes was determined by Chromatin immuno-precipitation ( Q9UNE7 ) . RNA interference was used to knock-down gene expression . RESULTS : P54855 and Q9NYP3 genes were not expressed in AR negative prostate cancer cell lines , PC3 and DU145 , while they were expressed in AR positive cell lines , LNCaP , LNCaP-abl ( an androgen independent LNCaP sub-line ) , and VCaP . The expression levels of P54855 / Q9NYP3 were up-regulated in LNCaP-abl comparing to those in LNCaP . These results suggest the requirement of AR for the expression of P54855 / Q9NYP3 . Treatment with DB02901 down-regulated the expression of P54855 / Q9NYP3 in LNCaP in a time and dose dependent manner and this down-regulation was competitively antagonized by flutamide and bicalutimide , suggesting a pathway mediated by AR . Further Q9UNE7 experiments demonstrated the direct interaction of AR with the promoter regions of P54855 / Q9NYP3 genes . Knocking down AR expression in LNCaP significantly reduced the expression of P54855 / Q9NYP3 and completely inhibited the DB02901 -induced down-regulation of P54855 / Q9NYP3 genes . CONCLUSIONS : We demonstrated that P54855 and Q9NYP3 are primary androgen-regulated genes and AR is required for both their basal expression and their androgen-regulated expression .
