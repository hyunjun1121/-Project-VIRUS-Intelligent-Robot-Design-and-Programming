The role of Q12809 K+ channels and a functional link between Q12809 K+ channels and P48061 in acute leukemic cell migration . Stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) and its unique receptor , P61073 , regulate stem/progenitor cell migration and retention in the bone marrow and are required for hematopoiesis . Recent studies found that Q12809 K(+) channels were important regulators of tumor cell migration . In this study , we investigated whether P48061 induced acute leukemic cell migration associated with Q12809 K(+) channels . Our results showed that E-4031 , a specific Q12809 K(+) channels inhibitor , significantly blocked P48061 -induced migration of leukemic cell lines , primary acute leukemic cells , leukemic stem cells and HEK293T cells transfected with herg-pEGFP . The migration of phenotypically recognizable subsets gave the indication that lymphoblastic leukemic cells were inhibited more than myeloid cells while in the presence of E-4031 which maybe associated with herg expression . P48061 increased Q12809 K(+) current expressed in oocytes and HEK293T cells transfected with herg-pEGFP . There were no significant changes of P61073 expression on both HL-60 cells and primary leukemic cells regardless if untreated or treated with E-4031 for 24 h ( P > 0.05 ) . The Q12809 K(+) current increased by P48061 might contribute to the mechanism of P48061 -induced leukemic cell migration . The data suggested that Q12809 K(+) channels functionally linked to cell migration induced by P48061 .
