Withacnistin inhibits recruitment of P40763 and P42229 to growth factor and cytokine receptors and induces regression of breast tumours . BACKGROUND : The binding of P40763 and P42229 to growth factor and cytokine receptors such as P00533 and P05231 receptor P40189 is critical to their activation and ability to contribute to malignant transformation . Therefore , interfering with these biochemical processes could lead to the discovery of novel anticancer agents . METHODS : Co-immunoprecipitation , western blotting , microscopy , DNA binding , invasion , and soft agar assays as well as a mouse model were used to investigate the mechanism by which the natural product Withacnistin ( Wit ) inhibits P35610 3/5 tyrosine phosphoryaltion and activation . RESULTS : Wit blocks P01133 - and P05231 -stimulated binding of P40763 and P42229 to P00533 and P40189 . Wit inhibits P01133 - , PDGF- , P05231 - , IFNÎ²- , and GM- P04141 -stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of P40763 and P42229 but not of P00533 or P09619 . The inhibition of P- P40763 and P- P42229 occurred rapidly , within minutes of Wit treatment and growth factor stimulation . Wit also inhibits P40763 nuclear translocation , DNA binding , promoter transcriptional activation , and it suppresses the expression levels of P40763 target genes such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 . Finally , Wit induces apoptosis , inhibits anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and invasion , and causes breast tumour regression in an ErbB2-driven transgenic mouse model . CONCLUSIONS : These data warrant further development of Wit as a novel anticancer drug for targeting tumours that harbour hyperactivated P40763 and P42229 .
