Detection of early onset of hypophysitis by (18)F- DB09150 PET-CT in a patient with advanced stage melanoma treated with ipilimumab . DB06186 is a human monoclonal antibody directed against a receptor expressed on activated T-lymphocytes ( P16410 ) . Binding to this receptor induces T-cell activation against tumor cells . A 77-year-old man with a stage IV metastatic melanoma was treated with ipilimumab . F- DB09150 PET-CT performed for response evaluation revealed intense uptake in the pituitary gland . Two weeks later , biochemical parameters altered confirming hypophysitis . Treatment of the hypophysitis was started , and shortly thereafter , biochemical parameters normalized . Follow-up PET-CT revealed normalization of F- DB09150 uptake in the pituitary gland . In this case , we present a patient with ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis initially diagnosed on F- DB09150 PET-CT .
