Genetic polymorphism and activities of human lung alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases : implications for ethanol metabolism and cytotoxicity . DB00898 dehydrogenase ( DB00067 ) and aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity . DB00067 and ALDH isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical Chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose isoelectric focusing . The identity of the lung beta-ADHs was further demonstrated by their characteristic pH-activity profiles for ethanol oxidation , Km values for NAD and ethanol , and inhibition by DB01213 or 1,10-phenanthroline . The beta 2 allele , coding for beta 2 polypeptide , was found to be predominant in the lung specimens studied . The DB00067 activities in the lungs with the homozygous phenotype P00325 2-2 ( exhibiting beta 2 beta 2 ) and P00325 1-1 ( exhibiting beta 1 beta 1 ) and the heterozygous phenotype P00325 P35326 ( exhibiting beta 2 beta 2 , beta 2 beta 1 , and beta 1 beta 1 ) were determined to be 999 +/- 77 , 48 +/- 17 , and 494 +/- 61 nmol/min/g tissue , respectively . Fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the P05091 activity band on the isoelectric focusing gels . The activities in the lung tissues with the P05091 -active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/g tissue , respectively . These findings indicate that human pulmonary ethanol-metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to genetic polymorphism at both the P00325 and the P05091 loci . The results suggest that individuals with high Vmax beta 2- DB00067 and deficient in low-Km mitochondrial P05091 , accounting for approximately 45 % of the Chinese population , may end up with acetaldehyde accumulation during alcohol consumption , rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic metabolite .
