Analysis of breast cancer related gene expression using natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model to identify prognostic associations . Many studies correlating gene expression data to clinical parameters assume a linear increase or decrease of the clinical parameter under investigation with the expression of a gene . We have studied genes encoding important breast cancer-related proteins using a model for survival-type data that is based on natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model , thereby removing the linearity assumption . Expression data of 16 genes were studied in relation to metastasis-free probability in a cohort of 295 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute . The independent predictive power for disease outcome of the 16 individual genes was tested in a multivariable model with known clinical and pathological risk factors . There is a linear relationship between increasing expression and a higher or lower hazard for distant metastasis for P03372 , Q15303 , P15692 , O96020 , Q15910 , and Q96NZ9 ; for P04626 , P21860 , P24385 , P24864 , O75530 , P61073 , P32248 , P48061 , and P05121 there is no clear increase or decrease ; and for P00533 there seems to be a non-linear relation . Multivariable analysis showed that the 70-gene prognosis profile outperforms all the other variables in the model ( hazard-rate 5.4 , 95 % CI 2.5-11.7 ; P = 0.000018 ) . P00533 -expression seems to have a non-linear relation with disease outcome , indicating that lower but also higher expression of P00533 are associated with worse outcome compared to intermediate expression levels ; the other genes show no or a linear relation .
