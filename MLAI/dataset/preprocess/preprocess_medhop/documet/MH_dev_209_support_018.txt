An analysis of the effects of retinoic acid and other retinoids on the development of adrenergic cells from the avian neural crest . In the present work , we have investigated the role of all-trans-retinoic acid ( all-trans RA ) , and several other natural and synthetic retinoids , in the development of adrenergic cells in quail neural crest cultures . Dose response studies using all-trans RA and 13-cis RA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the number of adrenergic cells in neural crest cultures . Similar dose response studies using RA isomers and other natural retinoids did not result in the same increases . In order to determine the receptor mediating the effects of all-trans RA in the neural crest , we tested several synthetic analogs which specifically bind to a particular RA receptor ( RAR ) subtype . We found that the compound AM 580 , which activates the P10276 , produced an increase in adrenergic cells similar to that seen with all-trans RA . The compound DB02877 , which activates all RAR subtypes , also resulted in an increase in adrenergic cells . We conclude that the increase in adrenergic cells seen with all-trans RA is mediated by P10276 and possibly P10826 . To further define the actions of all-trans RA on the neural crest we incubated cultures with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) to determine whether all-trans RA could affect the rate of proliferation . The results show that while all-trans RA did not increase the fraction of cells incorporating BrdU into their nuclei at early time points ( 24 h ) , it did increase BrdU incorporation by tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) positive cells at 5 days in culture . These findings demonstrate that the increase in adrenergic cells seen with all-trans RA in neural crest cultures is likely due to an increase in the proliferation of cells already expressing TH .
