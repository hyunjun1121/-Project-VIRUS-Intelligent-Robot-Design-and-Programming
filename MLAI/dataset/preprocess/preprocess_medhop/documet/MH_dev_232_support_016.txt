Reduced satiating effect of d-fenfluramine in serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor mutant mice . RATIONALE : d- DB00574 stimulates the release of serotonin ( 5-HT ) and is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals . Administration of d-fenfluramine suppresses food intake in both animals and humans . OBJECTIVE : We have investigated the role of the P28335 receptor in mediating the effect of d-fenfluramine on mouse food intake and the behavioural satiety sequence . METHODS : Mutant mice lacking serotonin P28335 receptors and wild-type animals were habituated to a daily presentation of wet mash . Animals were non-deprived and received d-fenfluramine ( 3-30 mg/kg ) 30 min prior to being assessed for the presence of stereotypy and presented with wet mash . The behaviour of animals was observed for the subsequent 40 min and food intake was recorded . RESULTS : d- DB00574 dose-dependently inhibited the consumption of a palatable wet mash by the mice . d- DB00574 ( 3 mg/kg ) significantly reduced the amount of wet mash consumed by wild-type mice and induced a temporal advance in the behavioural satiety sequence consistent with an enhancement of satiety . Mutant mice were less sensitive to the satiating effects of 3 mg/kg d-fenfluramine . Hence , this dose of d-fenfluramine had a reduced effect on both food consumption and the behavioural satiety sequence in the P28335 mutant mice . In contrast , mutant mice showed an increased sensitivity to the stereotypy induced by high doses of d-fenfluramine ( 10 , 30 mg/kg ) compared to that of wild-type littermates . CONCLUSION : These data demonstrate a role for the P28335 receptor in mediating d-fenfluramine-induced satiety .
