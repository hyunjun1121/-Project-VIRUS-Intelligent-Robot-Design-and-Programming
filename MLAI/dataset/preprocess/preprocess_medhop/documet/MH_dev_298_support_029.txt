A transcriptional repressor co-regulatory network governing androgen response in prostate cancers . Transcriptional corepressors are frequently aberrantly over-expressed in prostate cancers . However , their crosstalk with the P10275 ( AR ) , a key player in prostate cancer development , is unclear . Using ChIP-Seq , we generated extensive global binding maps of AR , ERG , and commonly over-expressed transcriptional corepressors including Q13547 , Q92769 , O15379 , and Q15910 in prostate cancer cells . Surprisingly , our results revealed that ERG , HDACs , and Q15910 are directly involved in androgen-regulated transcription and wired into an AR centric transcriptional network via a spectrum of distal enhancers and/or proximal promoters . Moreover , we showed that similar to ERG , these corepressors function to mediate repression of AR-induced transcription including cytoskeletal genes that promote epithelial differentiation and inhibit metastasis . Specifically , we demonstrated that the direct suppression of P18206 expression by ERG , Q15910 , and HDACs leads to enhanced invasiveness of prostate cancer cells . Taken together , our results highlight a novel mechanism by which , ERG working together with oncogenic corepressors including HDACs and the polycomb protein , Q15910 , could impede epithelial differentiation and contribute to prostate cancer progression , through directly modulating the transcriptional output of AR .
