Genetic variants in pre-eclampsia : a meta-analysis . BACKGROUND Pre-eclampsia has a clear familial component , suggesting that the condition may be partly attributable to genetic susceptibility . The search for susceptibility genes has led to a drastic increase in the number of published studies associating genetic factors with pre-eclampsia . However , attempts to replicate these findings have yielded inconsistent results . This meta-analysis assessed the pooled effect of each genetic variant that is reproducibly associated with pre-eclampsia . METHODS Studies that assessed the association between genes and pre-eclampsia were searched in PubMed , Embase and Web of Science . We selected all genetic variants that were significantly associated with pre-eclampsia in an initial study and were subsequently independently reproduced in at least one additional study . All studies that assessed these reproduced variants were then included . The association between genetic variants and pre-eclampsia was calculated at the allele level , and the main measure of effect was a pooled odds ratio in a random-effects model . RESULTS The literature search yielded 2965 articles , of which 542 investigated genetic associations in pre-eclampsia . We identified 22 replicated genetic variants , of which 7 remained significantly associated with pre-eclampsia following meta-analysis . These variants were in or near the following genes : P12821 , P16410 , F2 , FV , P06858 and P05121 . CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis identified seven genetic variants associated with pre-eclampsia . Importantly , many of these variants are also risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease , revealing that pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular disease have shared genetic risk factors . The contribution of the identified genetic variants in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia should be the focus of future studies .
