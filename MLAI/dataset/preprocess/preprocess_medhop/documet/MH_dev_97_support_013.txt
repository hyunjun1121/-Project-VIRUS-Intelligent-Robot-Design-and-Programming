Leukemogenesis as a new approach to investigate the correlation between up regulated gene 4/upregulator of cell proliferation ( Q8TCY9 / Q8TCY9 ) and signal transduction genes in leukemia . The aim of the study is to the determine the profiles of cell cycle genes and a new candidate oncogene of Q8TCY9 / Q8TCY9 which play role in leukemia , establishing the association between the early prognosis of cancer and the quantitation of genetic changes , and bringing a molecular approach to definite diagnosis . In this study , 36 newly diagnosed patients ' with ALL-AML in the range of 0-18 years and six control group patients ' bone marrow samples were included . Total RNA was isolated from samples and then complementary DNA synthesis was performed . The obtained cDNAs have been installed 96 well plates after prepared appropriate mixtures and assessed with LightCycler(Â®) 480 Real-Time PCR quantitatively . O14757 , Q8TCY9 / Q8TCY9 , P51959 , P24863 , Q13042 , P01116 , P55273 genes in the T-ALL group ; P30279 , Q13315 , P49336 , O14757 , P04637 , O96017 , Q16589 , P11802 , CDKN2A , Q16254 , P24863 , P01116 genes in the precursor B-ALL group and P30279 , Q00534 genes in the AML group have shown significant increase in mRNA expression level . In the featured role of acute leukemia the regulating signaling pathways of leukemogenesis partially defined , although identification of new genetic markers in acute leukemia subgroups , will allow the development of early diagnostic and new treatment protocols .
