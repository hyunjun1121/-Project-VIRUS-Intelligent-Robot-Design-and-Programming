Molecular identification of the human O75899 : cell surface expression and coupling to adenylyl cyclase in the absence of Q9UBS5 . We have identified a gene encoding a GABAB receptor , the human O75899 , located on chromosome 9q22.1 , that is distinct from the recently reported rat Q9UBS5 . O75899 structurally resembles Q9UBS5 ( 35 % identity ) , having seven transmembrane domains and a large extracellular region , but differs in having a longer carboxy-terminal tail . O75899 is localized to the cell surface in transfected COS cells , and negatively couples to adenylyl cyclase in response to GABA , baclofen , and 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid in CHO cells lacking Q9UBS5 . DB00181 action is inhibited by the GABABR antagonist , 2-hydroxysaclofen . The human O75899 and Q9UBS5 genes are differentially expressed in the nervous system , with the greatest difference being detected in the striatum in which Q9UBS5 but not O75899 mRNA transcripts are detected . O75899 and Q9UBS5 mRNAs are also coexpressed in various brain regions such as the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum . Identification of a functional homomeric O75899 coupled to adenylyl cyclase suggests that the complexity of GABAB pharmacological data is at least in part due to the presence of more than one receptor and opens avenues for future research leading to an understanding of metabotropic GABA receptor signal transduction mechanisms .
