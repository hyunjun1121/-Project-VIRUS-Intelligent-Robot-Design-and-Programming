Structure-activity relationships associated with 3,4,5-triphenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-nonanoic acid , a nonprostanoid prostacyclin mimetic . A series of phenylated pyrazoloalkanoic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of ADP-induced human platelet aggregation . 3,4,5-Triphenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-nonanoic acid ( 8d ) , with an IC50 of 0.4 microM , was the most potent inhibitor identified in this study . Biochemical studies determined that 8d increased intraplatelet DB02527 accumulation and stimulated platelet membrane-bound adenylate cyclase in a concentration-dependent fashion . Displacement of [3H]iloprost by 8d from platelet membranes indicated that the platelet prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) receptor is the locus of biological action . Structure-activity studies demonstrated that the minimum structural requirements for binding to the platelet P43119 and inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation within this series are a vicinally diphenylated pyrazole substituted with an omega-alkanoic acid side chain eight or nine atoms long . Potency depended upon both side-chain length and its topological relationship with the two phenyl rings .
