Peripheral medulloepithelioma : a rare tumor with a potential target therapy . BACKGROUND : Medulloepithelioma ( ME ) is a rare embryonal tumor predominantly located in the eye or in the central nervous system without an established treatment . CASE PRESENTATION : We report of a case of a localized peripheral ME treated with conventional and high dose chemotherapy , surgery and local radiotherapy . At relapse , the tumor tissue revealed a different molecular signature compared to the initial tumor mass . This molecular signature revealed a high expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) . DB00398 plus irinotecan and temozolomide was started with a 5 month progression free survival . CONCLUSION : Our experience suggests a possible role of sorafenib or different P09619 inhibitors in ME . Targeting treatment could represent an adjuvant and/or alternative therapy for ME and other rare tumors .
