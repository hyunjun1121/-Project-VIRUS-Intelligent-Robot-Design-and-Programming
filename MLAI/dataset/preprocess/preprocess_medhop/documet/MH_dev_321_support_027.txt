Retinoic acid-receptor activation of P07988 gene transcription in respiratory epithelial cells . Retinoids are known to play important roles in organ development of the lung . Retinoids exert their activity by modulating the expression of numerous genes , generally influencing gene transcription , in target cells . In the present work , the mechanism by which retinoic acid ( RA ) regulates surfactant protein ( SP ) B expression was assessed in vitro . RA ( 9- DB00982 ) enhanced P07988 mRNA in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells ( H441 cells ) and increased transcriptional activity of the P07988 promoter in both H441 and mouse lung epithelial cells ( MLE-15 ) . Cotransfection of H441 cells with retinoid nuclear receptor ( RAR ) -alpha , -beta , and -gamma and retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) -gamma further increased the response of the P07988 promoter to RA . Treatment of H441 cells with RA increased immunostaining for the P07988 proprotein and increased the number of cells in which the P07988 proprotein was detected . An RA responsive element mediating RA stimulation of the human P07988 promoter was identified . P10276 and -gamma and RXR-alpha but not P10826 or RXR-beta and -gamma were detected by immunohistochemical analysis of H441 cells . RA , by activating RAR activity , stimulated the transcription and synthesis of P07988 in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells .
