P04035 inhibitor , atorvastatin , promotes sensorimotor recovery , suppressing acute inflammatory reaction after experimental intracerebral hemorrhage . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Statins have neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke . They modify the endothelial function , increase blood flow , and inhibit thrombus formation , which are independent of lipid-lowering effects . However , whether statins have a protective effect toward hemorrhagic stroke is yet unknown . To test this possibility , we attempted to determine the effect of atorvastatin on experimental intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . METHODS : ICH was induced using stereotaxic infusion of collagenase into the left basal ganglia in adult rats . DB01076 ( 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg ) or phosphate-buffered saline was administered for 2 weeks . To monitor the sensorimotor deficits , limb placing and Rotorod tests were performed . Hematoma volume , brain water content , and hemispheric atrophy were analyzed . Immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) , microglia ( OX42 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , or endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) was performed . Perihematomal cell death was determined by TUNEL staining . RESULTS : The atorvastatin-treated ICH group showed better performance on Rotorod and limb placing tests when compared with the vehicle-treated group ( P < 0.01 ) . The hematoma volumes between groups were not different , but the brain water content and hemispheric atrophy were reduced in the atorvastatin-treated ICH group . DB01076 reduced TUNEL-positive cells , P35228 expression , and P05164 -positive or OX42-positive cells in the perihematomal regions in a dose-dependent manner , whereas it increased P29474 expression . CONCLUSIONS : The present study shows that atorvastatin reduces the perihematomal cell death via antiinflammation , which is associated with sensorimotor recovery after experimental ICH .
