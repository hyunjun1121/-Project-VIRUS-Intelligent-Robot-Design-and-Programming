Distorted antigen-presenting function of Langerhans cells induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha via a mechanism that appears different from that induced by ultraviolet B radiation . P01375 alpha ( P01375 alpha ) has been shown to mimic 2 effects of ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation in mice : morphologic damage to epidermal Langerhans cells ( LC ) and the inability to mount a normal contact hypersensitivity ( CH ) response . Our previous studies have shown LC to be the target of the immune tolerance evoked by UVB radiation , both during induction of CH in vivo and during presentation of protein antigen to P01730 + Th1 cells ( Th1 ) in vitro . To determine whether these influences of P01375 alpha and of UVB radiation on LC are related , 2 sets of experiments were performed . We first examined the effect of recombinant P01375 alpha on the capacity of epidermal cells enriched for LC ( IEC ) to present DB05299 ( KLH ) to KLH-specific and Iad-restricted Th1 . Addition of P01375 alpha to co-cultures of IEC and Th1 significantly reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . This inhibition was specific since it was reversed by neutralizing Ab against P01375 alpha . That P01375 alpha blocked Th1 proliferation by acting directly on LC is supported by 2 findings : 1 ) selective treatment of IEC prior to co-culturing also led to failure to present KLH ; and 2 ) P01375 alpha did not reduce Th1 proliferation stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin , or by P60568 . We next examined the capacity of anti- P01375 alpha Ab to protect LC from loss of antigen-presenting cell ( P25054 ) function induced by a single dose of 200 J/m2 UVB . Anti- P01375 alpha Ab tested over a broad dose range did not prevent or restore the ability of UVB-irradiated IEC to present KLH to Th1. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
