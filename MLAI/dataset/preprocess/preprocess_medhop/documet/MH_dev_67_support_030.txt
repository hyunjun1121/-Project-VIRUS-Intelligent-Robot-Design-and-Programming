Prostate cancer cell proliferation is strongly reduced by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 in vitro on human cell lines and primary cultures . PURPOSE : To investigate the effects of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( P00533 -TKI ) ZD1839 ( ' DB00317 ' ) on the cellular proliferation of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent human prostatic cancer cell lines and primary cultures in vitro . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : In this study , we investigated the effects of the quinazoline ZD1839 , a potent , selective P00533 -TKI , on the P00533 autophosphorylation and cellular proliferation of androgen-sensitive ( P03886 , LNCaP , and ALVA-31 ) and androgen-independent ( PC3 , DU145 , and TSU-Pr1 ) human prostatic cancer cell lines and 20 primary cultures derived from human prostatic cancer tissue . RESULTS : P00533 was present and phosphorylated in all cell lines tested . ZD1839 reduced P00533 autophosphorylation in intact cell lines with IC(50)s of 0.46-0.97 microM , and inhibited cellular proliferation with IC(50)s of 0.37-1.03 microM . Constitutive P00533 autophosphorylation was low in primary cell cultures , but addition of P01133 ( 50 ng/ml ) caused marked P00533 autophosphorylation ; cellular proliferation in the presence of P01133 was inhibited by ZD1839 with a mean IC(50) of 0.45 microM . At doses > 1 microM , ZD1839 induced apoptosis in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cell lines . CONCLUSION . Our experiments suggest that P00533 -TKIs such as ZD1839 may have potential in blocking the growth and progression of human prostatic cancers even in early phases of the disease .
