Induction of apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells by AHPN/CD437 is mediated by retinoic acid receptors . Retinoids have great promise in the area of cancer therapy and chemoprevention . These natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A have been shown to play an important role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation . While all-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of several ovarian tumor cell lines , other ovarian carcinoma cell lines have been found to be resistant to retinoid dependent growth suppression . Interestingly , a novel synthetic retinoid , CD437 or AHPN , has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of both DB00755 -sensitive ( CA-OV3 ) and DB00755 -resistant ( SK-OV3 ) ovarian tumor cell lines as well as to induce apoptosis . The overall goal of this research was to understand the mechanism by which AHPN/CD437 induces apoptosis in ovarian tumor cell lines . Since a number of studies have demonstrated the importance of nuclear receptors ( RARs and RXRs ) in mediating cellular responses to retinoids , we wished to determine the role of RARs in mediating the AHPN/CD437 response . We modulated RAR level and function by overexpressing either wild type P13631 or a pan dominant negative mutant of all RAR subtypes called P10826 ( R269Q ) , or through the use of an P13631 antagonist , MM11253 . We found that inhibition of RAR function reduced but did not eliminate induction of apoptosis in both CA-OV3 and SK-OV3 cells by AHPN/CD437 . Likewise , overexpression of wild type P13631 was found to increase apoptosis after treatment with AHPN/CD437 . Our results suggest that in ovarian carcinomas , AHPN/CD437 induced apoptosis is mediated at least in part via an RAR pathway .
