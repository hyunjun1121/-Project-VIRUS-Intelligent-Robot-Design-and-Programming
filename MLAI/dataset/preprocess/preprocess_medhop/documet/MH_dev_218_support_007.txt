Detection and quantification of cimicoxib , a novel P35354 inhibitor , in canine plasma by HPLC with spectrofluorimetric detection : development and validation of a new methodology . DB05095 ( CX ) is a selective P35354 inhibitor recently launched on the veterinary market . No analytical method to detect CX in biological samples has been published to date . The chromatographic separation was performed with a Kinetex C18 analytical column ( 100 mm × 4.6 mm , 2.6 μm particle size ) at 25 °C . The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:buffer ( 10 mM AcONH4 , pH 4.5 ) ( 35:65 , v/v ) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min . Excitation and emission wavelengths were 268 and 430 nm , respectively . The extraction used 500 μL of plasma added to 100 μL of IS ( 5 μg/mL ) and 100 μL of 10 % CF3COOH , extracted with 600 μL of C2H2:Et2O ( 3:7 , v/v ) . The organic phase was evaporated and reconstituted with 200 μL of mobile phase . The CX recovery ranged from 74.5 % to 82.6 % . The limit of quantification was 25 ng mL(-1) . The chromatographic runs were specific with no interfering peaks at the retention times of the analytes , as confirmed by HPLC-mass spectrometry experiments . The other validation parameters were in agreement with the international guidelines . The method was successfully tested on two dogs treated at two dose rates . It facilitated tracking of the plasma concentration for 24h and calculation of the main pharmacokinetic parameters . In conclusion , this method ( extraction , separation and applied techniques ) is simple , effective and specific . This is the first time that a method for the quantification of CX in plasma has been reported . This technique may have applications for further pharmacokinetic studies .
