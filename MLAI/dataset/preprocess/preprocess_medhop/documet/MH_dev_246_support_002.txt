Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor signal transduction in endothelial cells by dimethylaminopurine . P01375 ( P01375 ) promotes diverse responses in endothelial cells that are important to the host response to infections and malignancies ; however , less is known of the postreceptor events important to P01375 action in endothelial cells than in many other cell types . Since phosphorylation cascades are implicated in cytokine signaling , the effects of the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine ( DMAP ) on P01375 action in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) were investigated . In BAEC , P01375 promotes phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ( P06730 ) , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and ceramide-activated protein kinase activities , Jun-b expression , prostacyclin production , and , when protein synthesis is inhibited , cytotoxicity . DMAP abrogated or significantly attenuated each of these responses to P01375 , without affecting the specific binding of P01375 to its receptors . DB11320 , another agent active in the endothelium , promotes phosphorylation of elongation factor-2 ( P13639 ) and prostacyclin production , but not phosphorylation of P06730 in BAEC . DB11320 -stimulated P13639 phosphorylation was not inhibited and prostacyclin production was unaffected by DMAP . These observations demonstrate that a distinct signal transduction cascade , which can be selectively inhibited by DMAP , promotes the response of BAEC to P01375 . Thus , we have identified a reagent , DMAP , that may be useful for characterizing the P01375 signal transduction pathway .
