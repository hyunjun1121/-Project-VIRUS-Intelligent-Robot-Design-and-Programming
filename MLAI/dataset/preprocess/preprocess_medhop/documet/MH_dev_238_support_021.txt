The P04035 inhibitors , simvastatin , lovastatin and mevastatin inhibit proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells . BACKGROUND : A number of recent studies have suggested that cancer incidence rates may be lower in patients receiving statin treatment for hypercholesterolemia . We examined the effects of statin drugs on in vitro proliferation , migration and invasion of melanoma cells . METHODS : The ability of lovastatin , mevastatin and simvastatin to inhibit the melanoma cell proliferation was examined using cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays . Effects on cell migration and invasion were assessed using transwell invasion and migration chambers . Hypothesis testing was performed using 1-way Q9UNW9 , and Student 's t-test . RESULTS : DB00227 , mevastatin and simvastatin inhibited the growth , cell migration and invasion of HT144 , M14 and SK- P61006 -28 melanoma cells . The concentrations required to inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells ( 0.8-2.1 microave previously been achieved in a phase I clinical trial of lovastatin in patients with solid tumours , ( 45 mg/kg/day resulted in peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.9 micro CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that statin treatment is unlikely to prevent melanoma development at standard doses . However , higher doses of statins may have a role to play in adjuvant therapy by inhibiting growth and invasion of melanoma cells .
