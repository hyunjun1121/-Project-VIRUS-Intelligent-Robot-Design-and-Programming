DB08916 ( DB08916 ) development in non-small-cell lung cancer . DB08916 ( DB08916 ) , a novel aniline-quinazoline derivative , irreversibly and equipotently targets the intrinsic kinase activity of all active ErbB receptor family members . Preclinical results show that afatinib is effective in lung cancer models , including those with P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) mutations resistant to reversible first-generation P00533 inhibitors . DB08916 is being investigated in the LUX-Lung program , which will evaluate afatinib as a first-line treatment in patients with P00533 -activating mutations ( LUX-Lung 2 , 3 and 6 ) and as a second- or third-line treatment in patients that have acquired resistance to gefitinib and/or erlotinib ( LUX-Lung 1 , 4 and 5 ) . LUX-Lung 1 and 2 have demonstrated , within their respective target groups , a significant increase in the disease control rate of 58 and 86 % , respectively , and significant prolongation of progression-free survival . Further Phase III clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess afatinib in combination with paclitaxel ( LUX-Lung 5 ) , and compared with cisplatin/pemetrexed ( LUX-Lung 3 ) or cisplatin/gemcitabine ( LUX-Lung 6 ) .
