P49771 promotes myeloid dendritic cell differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells : possible application for cancer immunotherapy . Current in vitro culture systems allow the generation of human dendritic progenitor cells ( CFU-DCs ) . The aim of this study was to assess the effect of P49771 ( FL ) on the proliferation of human peripheral blood-derived myeloid CFU-DCs and their differentiation into more committed precursor cells ( pDCs ) using in vitro culture systems . Immunomagnetically separated P28906 + cells were cultured in serum-free , as well as in serum-containing , liquid suspension cultures to investigate the expansion and/or proliferation/differentiation of CFU-DCs , pDCs , and more mature dendritic cells ( DCs ) . FACS-sorted P28906 +Flt3+/- cells were cultured in methylcellulose to assay hematopoietic progenitors , including CFU-DCs . In the clonal cell culture supplemented with granulocyte/macrophage ( GM ) colony-stimulating factor ( P04141 ) , interleukin-4 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha , the frequency of CFU-DCs was significantly higher in the P28906 +Flt3+ fraction than in the P28906 +Flt3- population , thus suggesting functional Flt3 expression on CFU-DCs . Serum-free suspension culture of P28906 + cells revealed the potent effect of FL on the expansion of CFU-DCs in synergy with GM- P04141 and thrombopoietin ( P07202 ) . In addition , FL strongly induced the maturation of CFU-DCs into functional CD1a+ pDCs in serum-containing liquid suspension culture . Moreover , these FL-generated pDCs showed remarkable potential to differentiate into mature DCs with surface Q01151 / P42081 expression , which induced a distinct allogeneic T-cell response . These results clearly demonstrate that FL supports not only the proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells , but also the maturation process of committed precursor cells along with the DC-lineage differentiation . Therefore , it is possible to develop a more efficient DC-based cancer immunotherapy using this specific cytokine combination , GM- P04141 + P07202 +FL in vitro in the near future .
