Synaptic Q12879 and Q13224 containing DB01221 receptors within the superficial dorsal horn activated following primary afferent stimulation . DB01221 receptors are important elements in pain signaling in the spinal cord dorsal horn . They are heterotetramers , typically composed of two Q05586 and two of four GluN2 subunits : Q12879 -2D . Mice lacking some of the GluN2 subunits show deficits in pain transmission yet functional synaptic localization of these receptor subtypes in the dorsal horn has not been fully resolved . In this study , we have investigated the composition of synaptic DB01221 receptors expressed in monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways from peripheral sensory fibers to lamina I neurons in rats . We focused on DB05875 receptor-expressing ( P25103 + ) projection neurons , critical for expression of hyperalgesia and allodynia . EAB-318 and ( R ) -CPP , Q12879 /B antagonists , blocked both monosynaptic and polysynaptic DB01221 EPSCs initiated by primary afferent activation by âˆ¼90 % . Physiological measurements exploiting the voltage dependence of monosynaptic EPSCs similarly indicated dominant expression of Q12879 /B types of synaptic DB01221 receptors . In addition , at synapses between C fibers and P25103 + neurons , DB01221 receptor activation initiated a secondary , depolarizing current . DB08954 , a Q13224 antagonist , caused modest suppression of monosynaptic DB01221 EPSC amplitudes , but had a widely variable , sometimes powerful , effect on polysynaptic responses following primary afferent stimulation when inhibitory inputs were blocked to mimic neuropathic pain . We conclude that Q13224 subunits are moderately expressed at primary afferent synapses on lamina I P25103 + neurons , but play more important roles for polysynaptic DB01221 EPSCs driven by primary afferents following disinhibition , supporting the view that the analgesic effect of the Q13224 antagonist on neuropathic pain is at least in part , within the spinal cord .
