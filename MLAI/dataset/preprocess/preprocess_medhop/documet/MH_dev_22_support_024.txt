DB05773 , a novel antibody-drug conjugate , is highly effective against uterine and ovarian carcinosarcomas overexpressing P04626 . Ovarian and uterine carcinosarcoma ( CS ) are characterized by their aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis . We evaluated the efficacy of trastuzumab-emtansine ( DB05773 ) , against primary P04626 positive and P04626 negative CS cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Eight primary CS cell lines were evaluated for P04626 amplification and protein expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry , flow cytometry and qRT-PCR . Sensitivity to DB05773 -induced antibody-dependent-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) was evaluated in 4-h-chromium-release-assays . DB05773 cytostatic and apoptotic activities were evaluated using flow cytometry based proliferation assays . In vivo activity of DB05773 was also evaluated . P04626 protein overexpression and gene amplification were detected in 25 % ( 2/8 ) of the primary CS cell lines . DB05773 and T were similarly effective in inducing strong ADCC against CS overexpressing P04626 at 3+ levels . In contrast , DB05773 was dramatically more effective than T in inhibiting cell proliferation ( P < 0.0001 ) and in inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in the P04626 expressing cell lines ( shift of G2/M : mean ± SEM from 14.87 ± 1.23 to 66.57 ± 4.56 % , P < 0.0001 ) . Importantly , DB05773 was highly active at reducing tumor formation in vivo in CS xenografts overexpressing P04626 ( P = 0.0001 and P < 0.0001 compared to T and vehicle respectively ) with a significantly longer survival when compared to T and vehicle mice ( P = 0.008 and P = 0.0001 respectively ) . DB05773 may represent a novel treatment option for the subset of P04626 positive CS patients with disease refractory to chemotherapy .
