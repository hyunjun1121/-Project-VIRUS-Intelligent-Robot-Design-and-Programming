The lipoxygenase-cyclooxygenase inhibitor licofelone prevents thromboxane A2-mediated cardiovascular derangement triggered by the inflammatory peptide fMLP in the rabbit . DB04725 is an analogue of arachidonic acid that inhibits P09917 ( P28300 ) , cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 . We investigated the effects of licofelone on cardiovascular derangements and production of thromboxane (Tx)A(2) induced by the inflammatory agonist n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( fMLP ) in the rabbit , in comparison with those of aspirin or rofecoxib , inhibitors of P23219 and P35354 , respectively . In control rabbits , injection of fMLP ( 30 nmol/kg ) in the jugular vein evokes ischemic electrocardiographic ( ECG ) changes in the first 1-5 min , i.e. a profound depression of the ST segment and inversion of the T wave . Simultaneously , fMLP induces bradycardia and hypotension and increases TxB(2) blood levels . All changes are transient . DB04725 ( 60 mg/kg/5 days , p.os ) prevented fMLP-induced ECG ischemic changes in all treated animals , reverted bradycardia and hypotension , and significantly reduced TxB(2) . DB00945 ( 10 mg/kg/5 days , p.os ) prevented ischemic ECG alterations in 2 out of 5 treated animals and did not modify either bradycardia or hypotension . One rabbit died two min after fMLP . In 2 rabbits , aspirin reduced TxB(2) levels by more than 80 % respect to mean control values ; the remaining two rabbits produced an amount of TxB(2) similar to controls . These two rabbits also showed ischemic ECG changes . DB00533 ( 10 mg/kg/5 days , p.os ) did not prevent fMLP-induced ischemic ECG alteration , bradycardia and hypotension , and did not significantly modify the increase of TxB(2) . These results indicate that the capacity of licofelone to efficiently suppress TxA(2) production , is responsible for the protection from the cardiovascular derangement triggered by an inflammatory stimulus .
