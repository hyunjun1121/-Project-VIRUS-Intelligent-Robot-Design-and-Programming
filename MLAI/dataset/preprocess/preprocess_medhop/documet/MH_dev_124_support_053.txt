Molecular targeting of the oncoprotein P53350 in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia : RO3280 , a novel P53350 inhibitor , induces apoptosis in leukemia cells . P53350 ( P53350 ) is highly expressed in many cancers and therefore a biomarker of transformation and potential target for the development of cancer-specific small molecule drugs . RO3280 was recently identified as a novel P53350 inhibitor ; however its therapeutic effects in leukemia treatment are still unknown . We found that the P53350 protein was highly expressed in leukemia cell lines as well as 73.3 % ( 11/15 ) of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) samples . P53350 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AML samples compared with control samples ( 82.95 ± 110.28 vs. 6.36 ± 6.35 ; p < 0.001 ) . Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that shorter survival time correlated with high tumor P53350 expression ( p = 0.002 ) . The 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of RO3280 for acute leukemia cells was between 74 and 797 nM . The IC50 of RO3280 in primary acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) and AML cells was between 35.49 and 110.76 nM and 52.80 and 147.50 nM , respectively . RO3280 induced apoptosis and cell cycle disorder in leukemia cells . RO3280 treatment regulated several apoptosis-associated genes . The regulation of P43146 , P38936 , Q06187 , and O14508 was verified by western blot . These results provide insights into the potential use of RO3280 for AML therapy ; however , the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined .
