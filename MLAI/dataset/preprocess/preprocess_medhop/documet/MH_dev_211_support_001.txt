Function of endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( tribulin ) . Recent research on tribulin [ low molecular weight endogenous inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) ] has confirmed that its level is increased in both human urine and rat tissues by stress or anxiety , and by anxiogenic drugs . However tribulin is now known to contain several different molecules . The raised inhibitory activity in rat tissues is selective for P21397 . There is a parallel decrease in P21397 activity ex vivo , suggesting a possible functional effect . Increase in endogenous MAO I may competitively inhibit the binding of irreversible MAO I drugs , and may also help to mediate some mood altering effects of other drugs , or procedures such as ECT . In human urine both P21397 I and P27338 I have been found to be increased in mild stress . Similar findings have been made with human saliva . Selective inhibitors of P21397 have been identified from human urine , and pig brain , but it is not yet clear to what extent they account for the P21397 I activity increased in stress . DB02095 is an endogenous selective inhibitor of P27338 ( P04264 approximately 3 microM ) . It has a distinct distribution in rat brain , with highest concentration in the hippocampus of 0.1 microgram/g . Its level is increased by pentylene tetrazole , and isatin is itself anxiogenic in rodent models . Its administration also increases monoamine levels in the brain . It is a potent antagonist of the P01160 receptor , and it may act to link the control of monoamine function and natriuresis .
