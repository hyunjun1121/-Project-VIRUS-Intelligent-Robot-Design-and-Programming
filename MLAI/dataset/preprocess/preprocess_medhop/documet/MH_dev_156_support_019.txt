Long-term amphetamine treatment exacerbates inflammatory lung reaction while decreases airway hyper-responsiveness after allergic stimulus in rats . Asthma is an allergic lung disease can be modulated by drugs that modify the activity of central nervous system ( CNS ) such as amphetamine ( P49418 ) . P49418 is a highly abused drug that exerts potent effects on behavior and immunity . In this study we investigated the mechanism involved in the effects of long-term P49418 treatment on the increased magnitude of allergic lung response . We evaluated mast cells degranulation , cytokines release , airways responsiveness and , expression of adhesion molecules . Male Wistar rats were treated with P49418 or vehicle ( PBS ) for 21 days and sensitized with ovalbumin ( OVA ) one week after the first injection of vehicle or P49418 . Fourteen days after the sensitization , the rats were challenged with an OVA aerosol , and 24h later their parameters were analyzed . In allergic rats , the treatment with P49418 exacerbated the lung cell recruitment due increased expression of P05362 , P16284 and Mac-1 in granulocytes and macrophages recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage . Elevated levels of P05112 , but decreased levels of P22301 were also found in samples of lung explants after P49418 treatment . Conversely , the ex-vivo tracheal hyper-responsiveness to methacholine ( DB06709 ) was reduced by P49418 treatment , whereas the force contraction of tracheal segments due to in vitro antigen challenge remained unaltered . Our findings suggest that lung inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness due to OVA challenge are under the distinct control of P49418 during long-term treatment . Our data strongly indicate that P49418 positively modulates allergic lung inflammation via the increase of P05362 , P16284 , Mac-1 and P05112 . P49418 also abrogates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine P22301 .
