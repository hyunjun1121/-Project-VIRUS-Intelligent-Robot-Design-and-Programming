Targeting mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein ( TSPO ) regulates macrophage cholesterol efflux and lipid phenotype . The aim of the present study was to establish mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking 18 kDa translocator protein ( TSPO ) as a potential therapeutic target , capable of increasing macrophage cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein acceptors . Expression and activity of TSPO in human ( THP-1 ) macrophages were manipulated genetically and by the use of selective TSPO ligands . Cellular responses were analysed by quantitative PCR ( Q-PCR ) , immunoblotting and radiolabelling , including [3H]cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I ) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and human serum . Induction of macrophage cholesterol deposition by acetylated low-density lipoprotein ( AcLDL ) increased expression of TSPO mRNA and protein , reflecting findings in human carotid atherosclerosis . Transient overexpression of TSPO enhanced efflux ( E % ) of [3H]cholesterol to apoA-I , HDL and human serum compared with empty vector ( EV ) controls , whereas gene knockdown of TSPO achieved the converse . Ligation of TSPO ( using PK11195 , FGIN-1-27 and flunitrazepam ) triggered increases in [3H]cholesterol efflux , an effect that was amplified in TSPO-overexpressing macrophages . Overexpression of TSPO induced the expression of genes [ Q07869 ( peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor α ) , Q13133 ( nuclear receptor 1H3/liver X receptor α ) , O95477 ( DB00171 -binding cassette A1 ) , Q9H172 ( DB00171 -binding cassette G4 ) and P02649 ( apolipoprotein E ) ] and proteins ( O95477 and PPARα ) involved in cholesterol efflux , reduced macrophage neutral lipid mass and lipogenesis and limited cholesterol esterification following exposure to AcLDL . Thus , targeting TSPO reduces macrophage lipid content and prevents macrophage foam cell formation , via enhanced cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein acceptors .
