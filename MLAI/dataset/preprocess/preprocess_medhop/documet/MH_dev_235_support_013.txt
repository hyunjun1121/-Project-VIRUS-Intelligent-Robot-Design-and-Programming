Additive role of tiotropium in severe asthmatics and Arg16Gly in P07550 as a potential marker to predict response . BACKGROUND : Recent findings have raised new interests about the use of anticholinergics , especially tiotropium , for the treatment of asthma . This study was performed to determine whether an additional improvement in lung function is obtained when tiotropium is administrated in addition to conventional therapies in severe asthmatics , and to identify factors capable of predicting the response to tiotropium , using a pharmacogenetic approach . METHODS : A total of 138 severe asthmatics on conventional medications and with decreased lung function were randomly recruited . DB01409 18 microg was added once a day and lung functions were measured every 4 weeks . Responders were defined as those with an improvement of > or = 15 % ( or 200 ml ) in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) that was maintained for at least 8 successive weeks . Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in P11229 -3 ( coding muscarinic receptors one to three ) which were identified by re-sequencing , and Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu in P07550 ( coding beta(2) adrenoreceptor ) were scored in 80 of the 138 asthmatics . RESULTS : Forty-six of the 138 asthmatics ( 33.3 % ) responded to tiotropium treatment . Logistic regression analyses ( controlled for age , gender , and smoking status ) showed that Arg16Gly in P07550 [ P = 0.003 , OR ( 95 % CI ) = 0.21 ( 0.07-0.59 ) in a minor allele-dominant model ] was significantly associated with response to tiotropium . CONCLUSIONS : As many as 30 % of severe asthmatics on conventional medications with reduced lung function were found to respond to adjuvant tiotropium . The presence of Arg16Gly in P07550 may predict response to tiotropium .
