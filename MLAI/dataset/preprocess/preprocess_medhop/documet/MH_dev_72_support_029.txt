Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate induces apoptosis through peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma and P29323 1/2 activation in testis of Sprague-Dawley rats . Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) is a well-known hepatic and reproductive toxicant whose toxicity may be mediated by peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) . This study examined the effects of DEHP on the expression of Q07869 -regulated genes involved in testicular cells apoptosis . Sprague-Dawley male rats were treated orally with 250 , 500 , or 750 mg/kg/d DEHP for 28 d , while control rats were given corn oil . The levels of cell cycle regulators ( P06400 , cyclins , CDKs , and P38936 ) and apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis . The role of P37231 ( P37231 ) , class B scavenger receptor type 1 ( SR-B1 ) , and P27361 /2 was further studied to examine the signaling pathway for DEHP-induced apoptosis . Results showed that the levels of pRB , cyclin D , P24941 , cyclin E , and P11802 were significantly lower in rats given 500 and 750 mg/kg/d DEHP , while levels of P38936 were significantly higher in rat testes . Dose-dependent increases in P37231 and RXRalpha proteins were observed in testes after DEHP exposure , while there was a significant decrease in RXRgamma protein levels . In addition to P37231 , DEHP also significantly increased SR-B1 mRNA and phosphorylated P27361 /2 protein levels . Furthermore , DEHP treatment induced pro-caspase-3 and cleavage of its substrate protein , poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) , in a dose-dependent manner . Data suggest that DEHP exposure may induce the expression of apoptosis-related genes in testes through induction of P37231 and activation of the P27361 /2 pathway .
