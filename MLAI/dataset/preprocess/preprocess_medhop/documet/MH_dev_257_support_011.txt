Q9H244 (-)-receptor agonists enhance the proliferation of rat P13671 glioma cells through activation of the Q8NFH3 /44 mitogen-activated protein kinase . 1. Extracellularly added P(1),P(3)-di(adenosine-5') triphosphate ( Ap(3)A ) , P(1),P(4)-di(adenosine-5') tetraphosphate ( Ap(4)A ) , DB00171 , ADP , AMP and adenosine are growth inhibitory for rat P13671 glioma cells . Analysis of nucleotide hydrolysis and the use of nucleotidase inhibitors demonstrated that the latter inhibition is due to hydrolysis of the nucleotides to adenosine . 2 . Agonists of the Q9H244 (-)-receptor enhance the growth of P13671 cells if their hydrolysis to adenosine is inhibited by pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid ( PPADS ) . In these conditions , the potency to stimulate cell growth parallels the ranking of the receptor agonists , i.e. 2-methylthioadenosine-5'-diphosphate ( 2MeSADP ) > Ap(3)A > Ap(4)A . DB00171 and ADP are still hydrolysed in the presence of PPADS and have no proliferative effect on P13671 cells . 3 . The enhanced growth is due to a Q9H244 (-)-receptor-mediated activation of Q8NFH3 /44 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) as shown by immunoblotting and protein kinase assays for active MAPK and the use of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor PD98059 . 4 . The UTP-induced enhancement of the growth of P13671 cells is due to activation of MAPK by a PPADS sensitive nucleotide receptor . 5 . In conclusion , the effect of nucleotides on the growth of P13671 cells is determined by ecto-nucleotidases and by activation of nucleotide receptors . Hydrolysis of nucleotides to adenosine induces growth inhibition while inhibition of the hydrolysis of agonists of the Q9H244 (-)-receptor enhances cell growth by activation of MAPK .
