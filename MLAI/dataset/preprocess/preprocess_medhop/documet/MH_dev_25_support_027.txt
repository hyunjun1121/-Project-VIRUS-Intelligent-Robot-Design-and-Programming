Plasmin-induced proteolysis of tenascin-C : modulation by T lymphocyte-derived urokinase-type plasminogen activator and effect on T lymphocyte adhesion , activation , and cell clustering . Proteolysis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix occur physiologically in processes such as tissue morphogenesis and repair and may participate in the regulation of complex cell functions , including proliferation and differentiation . While matrix degradation appears to be relevant to T lymphocyte migration through tissues , little is known about whether degraded matrix affects T lymphocyte function . We have studied the interaction between T lymphocytes and tenascin-C ( TN-C ) , a matrix protein we have previously reported to inhibit T lymphocyte activation , in the context of plasmin-induced degradation . Here we report that plasmin efficiently cleaves TN-C . Peripheral blood T lymphocytes stimulated with phorbol ester , anti- P10747 , or anti-CD3 Ab , induce , within 24 to 48 h , a strong plasminogen-dependent proteolysis of TN-C . We demonstrate that stimulated T lymphocytes activate plasminogen by secreting the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) . P00747 activation by T lymphocyte-derived u-PA occurs efficiently in fluid phase in the absence of cells . We investigate the consequences of plasmin-induced proteolysis on three of the effects of TN-C in relation to lymphocyte functions . Plasmin proteolysis converts TN-C from a nonadhesive into an adhesive substrate for T lymphocytes and abolishes its aggregating activity on PBMC . In contrast , the inhibitory effect of TN-C on T lymphocyte activation remains unaffected . These observations demonstrate that stimulated T lymphocytes induce plasminogen-dependent proteolysis of TN-C by secreting u-PA and suggest that proteolysis of TN-C may represent a mechanism by which to regulate some of its effects on T lymphocyte functions .
