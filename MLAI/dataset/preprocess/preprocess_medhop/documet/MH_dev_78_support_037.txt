DB00758 and aspirin in cardiovascular medicine : responders or not -- current best available evidence . Dual antiplatelet therapy represents an important advance for patients with established coronary artery disease . It is an important strategy for patients with acute coronary syndromes and those undergoing percutaneous transcatheter coronary interventions . DB00758 effectively inhibits ADP-induced platelet activation and aggregation by selectively and irreversibly blocking the P2Y(12) receptor on the platelet membrane . DB00945 works by irreversibly acetylating the cyclooxygenase ( P23219 ) enzyme , thus suppressing the production of thromboxane A(2) ( TxA(2) ) and inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation . Variable platelet response and potential resistance to therapy has emerged with aspirin and clopidogrel . The definitions of antiplatelet agents variability in responsiveness and nonresponsiveness are discussed . DB00758 and aspirin responsiveness as they are measured in the laboratory by various techniques ( platelet aggregometry and point-of-care assays such as platelet function analyzer [ PFA-100 ] and rapid platelet function assay [ RPFA ] ) are evaluated . The mechanisms responsible for variations in responsiveness to antiplatelet agents such as clinical , cellular and genetic factors are defined . DB00945 and clopidogrel resistance are emerging clinical entities with potentially severe consequences such as myocardial infarction , stroke or death . The therapeutic interventions to deal with nonresponsiveness are reported , although specific recommendations are not clearly established . In the future , routine measurement of platelet function in patients with cardiovascular disease may become the standard of care . Personalized antithrombotic treatment strategies may be determined by ex-vivo measurements that identify critical pathways influencing thrombotic risk in the individual patient .
