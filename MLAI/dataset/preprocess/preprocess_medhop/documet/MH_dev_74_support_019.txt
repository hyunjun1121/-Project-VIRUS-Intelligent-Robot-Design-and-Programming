Characterization of the inhibitory effects of erythromycin and clarithromycin on the Q12809 potassium channel . Both erythromycin and clarithromycin have been reported to cause QT prolongation and the cardiac arrhythmia torsade de pointes in humans , however direct evidence documenting that these drugs produce this effect by blocking human cardiac ion channels is lacking . The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that these macrolide antibiotics significantly block the delayed rectifier current ( IKr ) encoded by Q12809 ( the human ether-a-go-go-related gene ) at drug concentrations , temperature and ionic conditions mimicking those occurring in human subjects . DB01345 currents in P29320 293 cells stably transfected with Q12809 were recorded using a whole cell voltage clamp method . Exposure of cells to erythromycin reduced the Q12809 encoded potassium current in a concentration dependent manner with an IC50 of 38.9 +/- 1.2 microM and Hill Slope factor of 0.4 +/- 0.1 . DB01211 produced a similar concentration-dependent block with an IC50 of 45.7 +/- 1.1 microM and Hill Slope factor of 1.0 +/- 0.1 . Erythromycin ( 25-250 microM ) and clarithromycin ( 5 or 25 microM ) also produced a significant decrease in the integral of the current evoked by an action potential shaped voltage clamp protocol . The results of this study document that both erythromycin and clarithromycin significantly inhibit the Q12809 potassium current at clinically relevant concentrations .
