Differential effects of all-trans and 13-cis-retinoic acid on mRNA levels of nuclear retinoic acid receptors in rat lung and liver . The effects of three retinoids , all-trans-retinoic acid ( all-trans-RA ) , 13- DB00982 , and etretin were examined on mRNA abundance of nuclear retinoic acid receptors ( P10276 , beta , and gamma ) in lung and liver of retinol deficient and chow fed rats . All-trans-RA increased lung P10826 mRNA levels 5 or 11-fold in chow fed and retinol deficient rats , respectively . Similarly to lung , liver P10826 mRNA levels were 3-fold higher in retinol deficient rats fed all-trans-RA than the rats fed cottonseed oil . Lung P13631 mRNA levels were also induced 2-fold by all-trans-RA . In contrast to this , 13- DB00982 and etretin at equimolar doses failed to enhance lung or liver P10826 or lung P13631 mRNA levels in retinol deficient rats . These data for the first time show that all-trans-RA is more effective than its 13-cis-isomer in regulating the expression of P10826 and gamma transcripts in adult animal .
