Inhibition of HCV by the serpin antithrombin III . BACKGROUND : Although there have been dramatic strides made recently in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection , interferon-α based therapy remains challenging for certain populations , including those with unfavorable Q8IZI9 genotypes , psychiatric co-morbidity , HIV co-infection , and decompensated liver disease . We have recently shown that P01008 , a serine protease inhibitor ( serpin ) , has broad antiviral properties . RESULTS : We now show that P01008 is capable of inhibiting HCV in the OR6 replicon model at micromolar concentrations . At a mechanistic level using gene-expression arrays , we found that P01008 treatment down-regulated multiple host cell signal transduction factors involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , including Jun , Myc and P12643 . Using a protein interactive network analysis we found that changes in gene-expression caused by P01008 were dependent on three nodes previously implicated in HCV disease progression or HCV replication : NFκB , O75791 MAPK , and P27361 /2 . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that P01008 stimulates a novel innate antiviral host cell defense different from current treatment options .
