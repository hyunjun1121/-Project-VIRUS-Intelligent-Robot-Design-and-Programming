Sub-family selective actions in the ability of Erk2 Q96HU1 kinase to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of DB05876 cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterases . Expressed in intact cells and in vitro , Q07343 and Q08493 isoenzymes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) , in common with Q08499 isoenzymes , are shown to provide substrates for C-terminal catalytic unit phosphorylation by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk2 ( Q8NFH3 (MAPK) ) . In contrast , P27815 isoenzymes do not provide substrates for C-terminal catalytic unit phosphorylation by Erk2 . Mutant DB05876 enzymes were generated to show that Erk2 phosphorylation occurs at a single , cognate serine residue located within the C-terminal portion of the DB05876 catalytic unit . DB05876 long-form isoenzymes were markedly inhibited by Erk2 phosphorylation . The short-form PDE4B2 isoenzyme was activated by Erk2 phosphorylation . These functional changes in PDE activity were mimicked by mutation of the target serine for Erk2 phosphorylation to the negatively charged amino acid , aspartic acid . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) challenge caused diametrically opposed changes in cyclic AMP levels in COS1 cells transfected to express the long PDE4B1 isoenzyme compared to cells expressing the short PDE4B2 isoenzyme . We suggest that DB05876 enzymes may provide a pivotal point for integrating cyclic AMP and Erk signal transduction in cells with 4 genes encoding enzymes that are either insensitive to Erk2 action or may either be activated or inhibited . This indicates that DB05876 isoenzymes have distinct functional roles , giving credence to the notion that distinct therapeutic benefits may accrue using either DB05876 subfamily or isoenzyme-selective inhibitors .
