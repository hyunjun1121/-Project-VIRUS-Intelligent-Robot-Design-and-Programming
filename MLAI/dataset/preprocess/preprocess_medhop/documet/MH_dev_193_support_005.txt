DB11320 reduces susceptibility to natural killer cells via down-regulation of P26718 ligands on human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cells . Natural killer ( NK ) group 2D ( P26718 ) is a key activating receptor expressed on NK cells , whose interaction with ligands on target cells plays an important role in tumorigenesis . However , the effect of histamine on P26718 ligands on tumour cells is unclear . Here we showed that human monocytic leukaemia THP-1 cells constitutively express MHC class I-related chain A ( Q29983 ) and Q9BZM6 on their surface , and incubation with histamine reduced the expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner as assessed by flow cytometry . Interferon-Î³ augmented the surface expression of the P26718 ligands , and this augmentation was significantly attenuated by histamine . The histamine H1 receptor ( P35367 ) agonist 2-pyridylethylamine and P25021 agonist dimaprit down-regulated the expression of P26718 ligands , and activation of P35367 and P25021 signalling by A23187 and forskolin , respectively , had the same effect , indicating that the histamine-induced down-regulation of P26718 ligands is mediated by P35367 and P25021 . Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that mRNA levels of the P26718 ligands and relevant microRNAs were not significantly changed by histamine . DB11320 down-regulated the surface expression of endoplasmic reticulum protein 5 , and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases did not impair this down-regulation , indicating that proteolytic shedding was not involved . Instead , pharmacological inhibition of protein transport and proteasome abrogated it , and histamine enhanced ubiquitination of Q29983 . Furthermore , histamine treatment significantly reduced susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity . These results suggest that histamine down-regulates P26718 ligands through the activation of an P35367 - and P25021 -mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and consequently reduces susceptibility to NK cells .
