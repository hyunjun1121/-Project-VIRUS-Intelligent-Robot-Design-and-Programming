Genetic polymorphisms , the metabolism of estrogens and breast cancer : a review . Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and the second cause of cancer death in women . Despite recent breakthroughs , much of the etiology of this disease is unknown and the most important risk factor , i.e. , exposure to endogenous and exogenous estrogen throughout life can not explain the heterogeneity of prognosis nor clinical features of patients . Recently , many gene polymorphisms in the metabolism of breast cancer have been described as possible neoplasm etiologic factors . This review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge about these polymorphisms and to determine new target genes for diagnosis and treatment of the disease . Polymorphisms in the genes P05093 , P11511 , P04798 , P05177 , Q16678 , P22309 , P50225 , 17-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase , P21964 , Q86UG4 , P03372 , and Q92731 are described .
