DB01017 protects PC12 cells against DB01221 -induced injury via inhibiting P09917 activation . Recently , we have reported that minocycline , a semi-synthetic tetracycline with neuroprotective effects , inhibits the in vitro ischemic-like injury and P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) activation in PC12 cells . In the present study , we further determined whether minocycline protects PC12 cells from excitotoxicity via inhibiting 5- P28300 activation . We used N-methyl-d-aspartate ( DB01221 , 200 microM ) to induce early ( exposure for 6 h ) and delayed ( exposure for 6 h followed by 24 h recovery ) injuries . We found that DB01221 receptor antagonist ketamine , 5- P28300 inhibitor caffeic acid and minocycline concentration dependently attenuated DB01221 -induced early and delayed cell injuries ( viability reduction and cell death ) . However , only ketamine ( 1 microM ) inhibited DB01221 -evoked elevation of intracellular calcium . In addition , immunohistochemical analysis showed that DB01221 induced 5- P28300 translocation to the nuclear membrane after 1- to 6-h exposure which was confirmed by Western blotting , indicating that 5- P28300 was activated . DB01221 , caffeic acid and minocycline ( each at 1 microM ) inhibited 5- P28300 translocation after early injury . After delayed injury , PC12 cells were shrunk , and 5- P28300 was translocated to the nuclei and nuclear membrane ; ketamine , caffeic acid and minocycline inhibited both cell shrinking and 5- P28300 translocation . As a control , P16050 inhibitor baicalein showed a weak effect on cell viability and death , but no effect on 5- P28300 translocation . Therefore , we conclude that the protective effect of minocycline on DB01221 -induced injury is partly mediated by inhibiting 5- P28300 activation .
