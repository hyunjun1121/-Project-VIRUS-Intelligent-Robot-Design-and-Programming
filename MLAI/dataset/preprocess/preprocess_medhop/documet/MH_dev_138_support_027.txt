The novel P04035 inhibitor , DB08860 , induces a protective action in vascular endothelial cells through the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) . This study sought to induce the effect of nitric oxide ( NO ) production in vascular endothelial cells by DB08860 , which is a novel P04035 inhibitor ( statin ) . The growth capacity of vascular endothelial cells significantly ( p < 0.01 ) declined when stimulated with P01375 ( 10 ng/ml ) . The growth capacity of the P01375 treated cells recovered , when the P01375 stimulation was performed after DB08860 ( 100 nM ) pretreatment . The recovery of the growth capacity of the cells was suppressed by the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor , L-NAME . DB08860 increased NO production by the vascular endothelial cells in a dose and time dependent manner . The NO production was suppressed by the presence of mevalonic acid and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate . In addition , the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was strongly induced by DB08860 , and was suppressed by mevalonic acid and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by Western blot analysis . Our results show that DB08860 induces NO production by vascular endothelial cells , and protects vascular endothelial cells from injury due to the inflammatory reaction induced by P01375 .
