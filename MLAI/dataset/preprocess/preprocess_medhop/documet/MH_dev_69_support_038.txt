Interaction of early environment , gender and genes of monoamine neurotransmission in the aetiology of depression in a large population-based Finnish birth cohort . Objectives Depression is a worldwide leading cause of morbidity and disability . Genetic studies have recently begun to elucidate its molecular aetiology . The authors investigated candidate genes of monoamine neurotransmission and early environmental risk factors for depressiveness in the genetically isolated population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 ( 12 058 live births ) . Design The authors ascertained and subdivided the study sample ( n=5225 ) based on measures of early development and of social environment , and examined candidate genes of monoamine neurotransmission , many of which have shown prior evidence of a gene-environment interaction for affective disorders , namely P31645 , Q8IWU9 , P21964 , P21397 and the dopamine receptor genes P21728 - P21918 . Results and conclusion The authors observed no major genetic effects of the analysed variants on depressiveness . However , when measures of early development and of social environment were considered , some evidence of interaction was observed . Allelic variants of P21964 interacted with high early developmental risk ( p=0.005 for rs2239393 and p=0.02 for rs4680 ) so that the association with depression was detected only in individuals at high developmental risk group ( p=0.0046 and β=0.056 for rs5993883-rs2239393-rs4680 risk haplotype CGG including Val158 ) , particularly in males ( p=0.0053 and β=0.083 for the haplotype CGG ) . Rs4274224 from P14416 interacted with gender ( p=0.017 ) showing a significant association with depressiveness in males ( p=0.0006 and β=0.0023 ; p=0.00005 and β=0.069 for rs4648318-rs4274224 haplotype GG ) . The results support the role of genes of monoamine neurotransmission in the aetiology of depression conditional on environmental risk and sex , but not direct major effects of monoaminergic genes in this unselected population .
