New targeted therapies in melanoma . BACKGROUND : The previous 2 years have been an exciting time in melanoma research , due in part to the approval of vemurafenib and ipilimumab for advanced melanoma . Increased knowledge of the molecular biology leading to melanoma has led to the development of several new agents that target specific oncogenes . METHODS : The authors review the latest developments in signal transduction inhibitors and in immune modulators for the treatment of melanoma . Investigational agents currently in development are also discussed . RESULTS : DB08881 and ipilimumab have improved overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma . Many new agents are in development , including programmed death-1 antibodies and combination signal transduction inhibitors . CONCLUSIONS : A recognition of the genetic diversity of melanoma and a better understanding of the immune system have resulted in improvements in overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma . Refractory cases remain challenging , and combination therapies are being explored in an effort to overcome resistance mechanisms . New molecular targets need to be identified to help the subset of patients who do not harbor P15056 mutations .
