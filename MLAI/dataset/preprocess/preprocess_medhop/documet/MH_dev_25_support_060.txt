Viral-induced P10747 loss evokes costimulation independent alloimmunity . BACKGROUND : DB06681 , a P33681 -specific fusion protein , blocks P10747 - P33681 costimulation and prevents kidney allograft rejection . However , it is ineffective in a sizable minority of patients . Although T-cell receptor and P10747 engagement are known to initiate T-cell activation , many human antigen-experienced T-cells lose P10747 , and can be activated independent of P10747 signals . We posit that these cells are central drivers of costimulation blockade resistant rejection ( CoBRR ) and propose that CoBRR might relate to an accumulation of P10747 (-) T-cells resulting from viral antigen exposure . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We infected C57BL/6 mice with polyomavirus ( a BK virus analog ) , murine cytomegalovirus ( a human cytomegalovirus analog ) , and gammaherpesvirus ( HV68 ; an Epstein-Barr virus analog ) and assessed for P10747 expression relative to mock infection controls . We then used mixed lymphocyte reaction ( P08235 ) assays to assess the alloreactive response of these mice against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells . RESULTS : We demonstrated that infection with polyomavirus , murine CMV , and HV68 can induce P10747 downregulation in mice . We showed that these analogs of clinically relevant human viruses enable lymphocytes from infected mice to launch an anamnestic , costimulation blockade resistant , alloreactive response against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells without prior alloantigen exposure . Further analysis revealed that gammherpesvirus-induced oligoclonal T-cell expansion is required for the increased alloreactivity . CONCLUSIONS : Virus exposure results in reduced T-cell expression of P10747 , the target of costimulation blockade therapy . These viruses also contribute to increased alloreactivity . Thus , P10747 downregulation after viral infection may play a seminal role in driving CoBRR .
