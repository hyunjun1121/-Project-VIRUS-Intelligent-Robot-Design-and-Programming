Osteoblast and osteocyte-specific loss of Connexin43 results in delayed bone formation and healing during murine fracture healing . Connexin43 ( P17302 ) plays an important role in osteoblastic differentiation in vitro , and bone formation in vivo . Mice with osteoblast/osteocyte-specific loss of P17302 display decreased gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) , bone density , and cortical thickness . To determine the role of P17302 in fracture healing , a closed femur fracture was induced in P02818 -Cre+ ; P17302 (flox/flox) ( Cx43cKO ) and Cre- ; P17302 (flox/flox) ( WT ) mice . We tested the hypothesis that loss of P17302 results in decreased bone formation and impaired healing following fracture . Here , we show that osteoblast and osteocyte-specific deletion of P17302 results in decreased bone formation , bone remodeling , and mechanical properties during fracture healing . Cx43cKO mice display decreased bone volume , total volume , and fewer TRAP+ osteoclasts . Furthermore , loss of P17302 in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a significant decrease in torsional rigidity between 21 and 35 days post-fracture , compared to WT mice . These studies identify a novel role for the gap junction protein P17302 during fracture healing , suggesting that loss of P17302 can result in both decreased bone formation and bone resorption . Therefore , enhancing P17302 expression or GJIC may provide a novel means to enhance bone formation during fracture healing .
