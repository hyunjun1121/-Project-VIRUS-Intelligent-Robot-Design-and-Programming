Amsacrine and etoposide hypersensitivity of yeast cells overexpressing DNA topoisomerase II . Increasing the cellular concentration of DNA topoisomerase II in yeast by expressing constitutively a plasmid-borne P11388 gene encoding the enzyme greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to amsacrine and etoposide ( DB00773 ) . This increased drug sensitivity at a higher intracellular DNA topoisomerase II level is observed in both P43351 + repair-proficient strains and rad52 mutants that are defective in the repair of double-stranded breaks . These results provide strong support of the hypothesis that the cellular target of these drugs is DNA topoisomerase II , and that these drugs kill cells by converting DNA topoisomerase II into a DNA damaging agent .
