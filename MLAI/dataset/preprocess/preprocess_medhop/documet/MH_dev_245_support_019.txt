Genetic variants in apoptosis and immunoregulation-related genes are associated with risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . To identify low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , we performed a case-control study genotyping 768 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) in 692 cases of CLL and 738 controls . We investigated nonsynonymous SNPs , SNPs with potential functional effect , and tag SNPs in regulatory gene regions in a total of 172 genes involved in cancer biology . After adjustment for multiple testing , we found a strong association between CLL risk and six genetic variants : P51946 ( rs2266690 , V270A ) , O14727 ( rs17028658 , 3'region ) , Q14005 ( rs4505265 , first intron ) , Q14790 ( rs1045485 , D302H ) , P35228 ( rs2779251 , promoter ) , and P32248 ( rs3136687 , intron 1 ) . We found association with CLL susceptibility and 22 haplotypes in O14727 , P05231 , O14836 , Q14005 , P42574 , P32248 , P01374 / P01375 , Q07812 , P10415 , P48061 , CASP10/ Q14790 , P29466 , P13500 , Q16611 , and P01583 candidate genes . Finally , we evaluated using public data sets the potential functional effect on gene expression levels of the CLL associated genetic variants detected in regulatory regions . Minor alleles for O14727 and Q14005 were associated with lower mRNA levels ; no expression differences were observed for P32248 , whereas P35228 could not be assessed . This study suggests that common genetic variation in apoptosis- and immunoregulation-related genes is associated with the CLL risk .
