Autologous P15941 -specific Th1 effector cell immunotherapy induces differential levels of systemic TReg cell subpopulations that result in increased ovarian cancer patient survival . Adoptive T cell immunotherapy using autologous lymphocytes is a viable treatment for patients with cancer and requires participation of Ag-specific P01730 and CD8 T cells . Here , we assessed the immunotherapeutic effects of autologous P15941 peptide-stimulated P01730 (+) effector cells following adoptive transfer in patients with ovarian cancer . Using P15941 peptide and P60568 for ex vivo P01730 (+)/Th1 effector cell generation , we show that three monthly treatment cycles of peripheral blood T cell restimulation and intraperitoneal re-infusion selectively modulated endogenous T cell-mediated immune responses that correlated with diminished serum Q8WXI7 tumor marker levels and enhanced patient survival . One patient remains disease-free , another patient survived long-term for nearly 16 months with recurrent disease and two patients expired within 3-5 months following final infusion . Although PBL from all patients showed elevated P15941 cytolytic activity following therapy , such responses did not correlate with therapeutic efficacy . Long-term survivors showed elevated levels of systemic memory ( CD45RO ) and na√Øve ( CD45RA ) CD3/ P01730 /CD25(+) T cells when compared to that of pre-treatment levels and similarly treated short-term survivors . Such cells co-expressed different levels of Foxp3 and P16410 that resulted in progressively lower systemic Foxp3/ P16410 memory T cell ratios that further correlated with disease-free survival . Lastly , these patients showed elevated levels of P15941 -specific T cells expressing the P51681 and P32246 chemokine receptors and the chemokine P13236 associated with Th1 cell differentiation/memory . We suggest that effective immunotherapy with autologous P15941 -stimulated P01730 (+) effector cells induces differential levels of systemic " Ag-experienced " and " Ag-inexperienced " P01730 /CD25(+) TReg cell subpopulations that influence long-term tumor immunity in ovarian cancer patients .
