Reduction of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression in patients with cystic fibrosis . As a consequence of diminished nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) protein concentration , the airway concentration of nitric oxide ( NO ) is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . This appears to lead to a reduced elimination of such microorganisms as Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The objective of this study was to analyze whether inducible ( P35228 ) , endothelial ( P29474 ) and neuronal ( P29475 ) NOS are reduced at mRNA level and if so whether this is caused directly by the defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Nasal polyps from three patients with CF and four otherwise healthy patients were obtained . The expression of the three NOS isoenzymes was quantified using real-time PCR . The P35228 expression was assessed in colon carcinoma cells ( CaCo ) transfected with a normal and a mutated ( DeltaF508 ) P13569 . In CF patients , P35228 mRNA expression was 10-to 20-fold and P29475 gene expression was one-fifth to one-tenth that in control patients ( P < 0.001 ) . In CaCo cells , P35228 gene expression under basal and endotoxin-stimulated conditions did not differ between cells transfected with a mutated P13569 and those transfected with an intact P13569 . This observation suggests that cystic fibrosis is associated with reduced P35228 and P29475 gene expression in nasopharyngeal tissue , possibly disturbing the barrier against infective agents already at the site of entrance .
