' Bridged ' stilbene derivatives as selective cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors . DB02709 ( ( E ) - DB02709 ) , a phytoalexin found in various plants , shows non-selective cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibition . In order to find more selective P36551 inhibitors a series of bridged stilbene derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit both P23219 and P35354 in vitro . The compounds showed a high rate of P23219 inhibition with the most potent compounds exhibiting submicromolar IC(50) values and high selectivity indices . A prediction model for P36551 -inhibiting activity was also developed using the classical LIE approach resulting in consistent docking data for our molecule sample . Phenyl substituted 1,2-dihydronaphthalene derivatives and 1H-indene derivatives therefore represent a novel class of highly selective P23219 inhibitors and land promising candidates for in vivo studies .
