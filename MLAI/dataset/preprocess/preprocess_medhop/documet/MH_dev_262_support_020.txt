Genetic markers in the EET metabolic pathway are associated with outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Preclinical studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) regulate cerebrovascular tone and protect against cerebral ischemia . We investigated the relationship between polymorphic genes involved in EET biosynthesis/metabolism , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) eicosanoid levels , and outcomes in 363 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( DHET ) cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) levels , as well as acute outcomes defined by delayed cerebral ischemia ( P42126 ) or clinical neurologic deterioration ( CND ) , were assessed over 14 days . Long-term outcomes were defined by Modified Rankin Scale ( P59665 ) at 3 and 12 months . P10632 *4 allele carriers had 44 % and 36 % lower mean EET and DHET P04141 levels ( P=0.003 and P=0.007 ) and were 2.2- and 2.5-fold more likely to develop P42126 and CND ( P=0.039 and P=0.041 ) , respectively . P34913 55Arg , P51589 *7 , P10632 *1B , and P10632 g.36785A allele carriers had lower EET and DHET P04141 levels . P10632 g.25369T and P10632 g.36755A allele carriers had higher EET levels . Patients with P10632 *2C and P34913 404del variants had worse long-term outcomes while those with P34913 287Gln , P51589 *7 , and P11712 g.816G variants had favorable outcomes . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were associated with Fisher grade and unfavorable 3-month outcomes . Dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were not associated with outcomes . No associations passed Bonferroni multiple testing correction . These are the first clinical data demonstrating the association between the EET biosynthesis/metabolic pathway and the pathophysiology of aSAH .
