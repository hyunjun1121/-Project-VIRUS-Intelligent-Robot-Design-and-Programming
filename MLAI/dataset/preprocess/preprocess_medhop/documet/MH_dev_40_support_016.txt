Angiogenic and inflammatory factor expressions in cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis ( Cobb 's syndrome ) : case report . We report on a case of cervical cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis ( Cobb 's syndrome ) , a rare somatic disorder , characterized by vascular abnormalities of the spinal cord , with a triad of associated vascular skin , muscle , bone , and dura involvement at the same somite . This case follows an 18-year-old male patient presenting with left extremity weakness and back cervical pain . Magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) revealed a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) at the P01024 - P01031 level . Cobb 's syndrome was diagnosed by coexistence of cutaneous naevi in a dermatomal pattern and neurological signs of a spinal cord lesion together with cervical Q9BWK5 and angiography . The patient underwent a combination of staged endovascular embolization and microsurgical resection . Multiple biopsies of the mass including the skin , muscle , dura , and spinal cord at the same somite revealed that the lesions had a similar pathology . Post-operative immunohistochemical characterizations on specimen included CD31 , smooth muscle actin ( SMA ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and matrix metalloproteinase ( P14780 ) . The unique associations of somatic and spinal cord lesion as well as angiogenic and inflammatory factor expressions in all specimens are reported .
