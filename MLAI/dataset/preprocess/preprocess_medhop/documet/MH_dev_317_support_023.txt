Opioid and non-opioid DB01221 -mediated predator-induced analgesia in mice and the effects of parasitic infection . The present study examined the nociceptive responses ( 50 degrees C , hot-plate ) of uninfected and subclinically parasitized male mice exposed to the odor of a predator , an ecologically relevant threatening stimulus . In uninfected mice a 15-min exposure to 2-propylthietane , the major component of weasel odor , induced a naloxone-reversible opioid analgesia . A 30-s exposure elicited a shorter duration and lower amplitude ' non-opioid ' analgesia that was insensitive to naloxone , partially sensitive to either the serotonin-1A ( P08908 ) agonist , 8-OH-DPAT , or the GABAA antagonist , bicuculline , and blocked by the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) antagonist , NPC 12626 . In contrast , mice chronically ( 25 days ) and subclinically infected with the murine nematode , Heligmosomoides polygyrus , failed to show a significant non-opioid analgesia and displayed a markedly lower level of opioid analgesia than uninfected mice . These results suggest that DB01221 receptor mechanisms are potently associated with the expression of the analgesia arising from exposure to the naturally aversive stimulus of predator odor . These findings also demonstrate that parasites , and likely other subchronic infections , can have a significant impact on the display of opioid and non-opioid stress-induced analgesia arising from exposure to the ethologically relevant stimulus of predator odor .
