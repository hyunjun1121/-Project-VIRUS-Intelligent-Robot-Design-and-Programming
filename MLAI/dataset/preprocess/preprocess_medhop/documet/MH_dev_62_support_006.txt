Profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis . Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis ( PsO ) . PsA could be considered an enthesal disease because of the link between mechanical stress ( entheses ) and immunologically active tissue ( synovium ) . Evidence of efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -α ) is supported by reduction of histological vascularity and immune cell infiltrates in synovial tissue after treatment . DB08904 ( CZP ) is a polyethylene glycolylated ( PEGylated ) Fab ' fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human P01375 -α . The PEG moiety of the Fab fragment , markedly increases the half-life of CZP and confers to the drug a unique structure that differs from the other anti- P01375 -α agents tested for the treatment of Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , axial spondyloarthritis , nonradiographic spondyloarthritis , PsO , and PsA . In contrast to other anti- P01375 -α agents , CZP did not mediate increased levels of apoptosis , suggesting that these mechanisms are not essential for the anti- P01375 -α efficacy in Crohn 's disease . As CZP , infliximab , and adalimumab , but not etanercept , almost completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta release from monocytes , this cytokine-production inhibition may be relevant for drug efficacy . Due to these characteristics , it has been demonstrated in clinical studies that CZP effectively improves signs and symptoms of arthritis and physical function and skin manifestations of PsO , with a safety profile similar to rheumatoid arthritis . This drug can be considered as a valid treatment in patients affected by PsA . The efficacy and tolerability profiles suggest CZP as a suitable antipsoriatic drug in the treatment of PsA .
