Kringle 1-4 of hepatocyte growth factor inhibits proliferation and migration of human microvascular endothelial cells . P24001 composed of the N-terminal hairpin and subsequent four-kringle domains of hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) is bifunctional , acting as a competitive antagonist for P14210 and an angiogenesis inhibitor . In this study , we determined whether or not four-kringle domains of P14210 ( P04264 -4 ) have anti-angiogenic activity . For this purpose , we prepared recombinant P04264 -4 and P24001 , using the baculovirus expression system . Although P24001 antagonized P14210 -induced DNA synthesis of rat hepatocytes , cell scattering of MDCK cells and the c- DB00134 / P08581 tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells , P04264 -4 failed to antagonize P14210 -induced DNA synthesis , cell scattering and the c- DB00134 / P08581 tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells , thus , indicating that P04264 -4 lacks P14210 -antagonist activity . However , endothelial proliferation and migration induced by P14210 was inhibited by P04264 -4 , similar to the case seen with P24001 . Furthermore , P04264 -4 inhibited the proliferation and migration of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells induced by vascular endothelial growth factor or by basic fibroblast growth factor . We propose that kringle 1-4 of P14210 inhibits angiogenic responses in endothelial cells , independently of P14210 -c- DB00134 signaling pathways .
