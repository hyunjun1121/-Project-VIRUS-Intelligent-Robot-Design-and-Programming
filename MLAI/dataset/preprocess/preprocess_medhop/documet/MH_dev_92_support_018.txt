DB08816 reduces neutrophil recruitment and lung damage in abdominal sepsis . Abstract Platelets play an important role in abdominal sepsis and Q9H244 receptor antagonists have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects . Herein , we assessed the impact of platelet inhibition with the Q9H244 receptor antagonist ticagrelor on pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and tissue damage in a model of abdominal sepsis . Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) . Animals were treated with ticagrelor ( 100 mg/kg ) or vehicle prior to CLP induction . Edema formation and bronchoalveolar neutrophils as well as lung damage were quantified . Flow cytometry was used to determine expression of platelet-neutrophil aggregates , neutrophil activation and P29965 expression on platelets . CLP-induced pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils at 24 hours was reduced by 50 % in ticagrelor-treated animals . Moreover , ticagrelor abolished CLP-provoked lung edema and decreased lung damage score by 41 % . Notably , ticagrelor completely inhibited formation of platelet-neutrophil aggregates and markedly reduced thrombocytopenia in CLP animals . In addition , ticagrelor reduced platelet shedding of P29965 in septic mice . Our data indicate that ticagrelor can reduce CLP-induced pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and lung damage suggesting a potential role for platelet antagonists , such as ticagrelor , in the management of patients with abdominal sepsis .
