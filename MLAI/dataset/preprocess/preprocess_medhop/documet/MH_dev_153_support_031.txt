Targeting Q01196 / Q06455 -histone deacetylase repressor complex : a novel mechanism for valproic acid-mediated gene expression and cellular differentiation in Q01196 / Q06455 -positive acute myeloid leukemia cells . In t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein promotes leukemogenesis by recruiting class I histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) -containing repressor complex to the promoter of Q01196 target genes . Valproic acid ( DB00313 ) , a commonly used antiseizure and mood stabilizer drug , has been shown to cause growth arrest and induce differentiation of malignant cells via HDAC inhibition . DB00313 causes selective proteasomal degradation of Q92769 but not other class I HDACs ( i.e. , HDAC 1 , 3 , and 8 ) . Therefore , we raised the question of whether this drug can effectively target the leukemogenic activity of the Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein that also recruits Q13547 , a key regulator of normal and aberrant histone acetylation . We report here that DB00313 treatment disrupts the Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 physical interaction , stimulates the global dissociation of Q01196 / Q06455 - Q13547 complex from the promoter of Q01196 / Q06455 target genes , and induces relocation of both Q01196 / Q06455 and Q13547 protein from nuclear to perinuclear region . Furthermore , we show that mechanistically these effects associate with a significant inhibition of HDAC activity , histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation , and recruitment of RNA polymerase II , leading to transcriptional reactivation of target genes ( i.e. , P08700 ) otherwise silenced by Q01196 / Q06455 fusion protein . Ultimately , these pharmacological effects resulted in significant antileukemic activity mediated by partial cell differentiation and caspase-dependent apoptosis . Taken together , these data support the notion that DB00313 might effectively target Q01196 / Q06455 -driven leukemogenesis through disruption of aberrant Q13547 function and that DB00313 should be integrated in novel therapeutic approaches for Q01196 / Q06455 -positive AML .
