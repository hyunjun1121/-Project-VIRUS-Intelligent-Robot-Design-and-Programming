Improvement of psoriasis during exenatide treatment in a patient with diabetes . CONTEXT AND AIM : Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder frequently associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . This report is of a clinically significant improvement in psoriasis lesions in a patient with T2D during treatment with a P43220 agonist ( exenatide ) . OBSERVATION : A 61-year-old male patient ( BMI : 25.5 kg/m(2) ) with T2D treated with metformin and sulphonylureas had also complained , since 1980 , of extensive psoriasis that required multiple steroid-based treatments [ Psoriasis Area and Sensitivity Index ( PASI ) score : 11 ] . In September 2008 , his diabetes treatment was intensified with exenatide ( DB01276 (Â®) ) to improve poor glycaemic control . The patient , as expected , lost weight and reduced HbA(1c) levels from 65 mmol/mol to 56 mmol/mol . However , after just 1 month of treatment with exenatide , the patient also reported a dramatic improvement in psoriatic plaques that was confirmed at the 1-year follow-up ( PASI : estimated at 3-4 ) . Withdrawal of exenatide was associated with weight gain , deterioration of glycaemic control and deterioration of psoriasis ( PASI: > 10 ) . After reinstating exenatide treatment , the patient again reported a prompt improvement in psoriasis ( PASI : 3.1 ) . CONCLUSION : There was a major and rapid improvement in psoriasis in our patient with T2D following treatment with exenatide . A possible mechanism might be through direct modulation of the immune system by P43220 agonists .
