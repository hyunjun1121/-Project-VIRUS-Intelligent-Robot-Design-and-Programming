DB02701 pre-treatment ameliorates NAD(H) hyperoxidation and improves neuronal function after severe hypoxia . Prolonged hypoxia leads to irreversible loss of neuronal function and metabolic impairment of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide recycling ( between NAD(+) and DB00157 ) immediately after reoxygenation , resulting in DB00157 hyperoxidation . We test whether the addition of nicotinamide ( to enhance NAD(+) levels ) or P09874 inhibition ( to prevent consumption of NAD(+) ) can be effective in improving either loss of neuronal function or hyperoxidation following severe hypoxic injury in hippocampal slices . After severe , prolonged hypoxia ( maintained for 3min after spreading depression ) there was hyperoxidation of DB00157 following reoxygenation , an increased soluble NAD(+)/ DB00157 ratio , loss of neuronal field excitatory post-synaptic potential ( fEPSP ) and decreased DB00171 content . DB02701 incubation ( 5mM ) 2h prior to hypoxia significantly increased total NAD(H) content , improved neuronal recovery , enhanced DB00171 content , and prevented DB00157 hyperoxidation . The nicotinamide-induced increase in total soluble NAD(H) was more significant in the cytosolic compartment than within mitochondria . Prolonged incubation with PJ-34 ( > 1h ) led to enhanced baseline DB00157 fluorescence prior to hypoxia , as well as improved neuronal recovery , DB00157 hyperoxidation and DB00171 content on recovery from severe hypoxia and reoxygenation . In this acute model of severe neuronal dysfunction prolonged incubation with either nicotinamide or PJ-34 prior to hypoxia improved recovery of neuronal function , enhanced DB00157 reduction and DB00171 content , but neither treatment restored function when administered during or after prolonged hypoxia and reoxygenation .
