Leukotriene D4-induced increases in cytosolic calcium in THP-1 cells : dependence on extracellular calcium and inhibition with selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists . Agonist-induced changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ( [Ca++]i ) were examined in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells loaded with fura 2/acetoxymethyl ester ( fura 2/AM ) . Leukotriene (LT)D4 induced a concentration-dependent biphasic response consisting of a transient phase ( up to 5-fold peak increase ) followed by a sustained phase , showing characteristics of a receptor-operated calcium channel . Homologous desensitization to LTD4 was observed . The responses to LTD4 were reduced by 80 to 90 % in calcium-free buffer . The responses to LTD4 in a calcium-free buffer were dependent upon the duration of prior exposure of the cells to a calcium-free environment . The response at 30 or 60 min after exposure to calcium-free buffer was greater than that at earlier time points ( time-dependent sensitization ) . Similar responses were obtained with THP-1 cells exposed to DB00974 -containing buffer . It is speculated that such time-dependent sensitization is a result of changes at the receptor level . The responses to LTD4 were blocked by two specific LTD4 antagonists , MK-0571 and DB00549 , in a concentration-dependent manner . When given after addition of LTD4 , MK-0571 or DB00549 reversed the sustained phase of the LTD4-induced response , suggesting that maintenance of the response requires persistent activation of the Q9Y271 . DB00549 was 5 to 10 times more potent than MK-0571 ( IC50 values of 1.1 and 9.3 nM , respectively ) , in agreement with results from radioligand binding studies reported separately .
