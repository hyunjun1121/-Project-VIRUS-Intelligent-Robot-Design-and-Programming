Synergistic inhibition of human colon cancer cell growth by the cannabinoid P21554 receptor antagonist rimonabant and oxaliplatin . DB06155 ( SR141716 ) , a highly selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist , exerts along with its anti-obesity action , pleiotropic functions affecting a broad range of diseases , from obesity-related co-morbidities to drug dependence and cancer . Several studies suggested an anti-tumour activity of rimonabant in several in vitro and in vivo models . In this study , we compared the anti-proliferative effect of SR141716 in the human colon cancer cell line DLD-1 with oxaliplatin , one of the cytotoxic drugs currently used in the treatment of colorectal cancer . We show that SR141716 inhibits DLD-1 cell proliferation similarly to oxaliplatin and if administered in combination SR141716 potentiated the inhibitory effect caused by oxaliplatin . Assessment of drug interaction was performed calculating combination index that showed a strong synergistic effect between the two drugs added to cells in combination . Our findings suggest that the combined synergic effect of SR141716 and oxaliplatin improves the blocking of colon cancer cell proliferation . Therefore , this combination merits further explorations in preclinical and clinical settings .
