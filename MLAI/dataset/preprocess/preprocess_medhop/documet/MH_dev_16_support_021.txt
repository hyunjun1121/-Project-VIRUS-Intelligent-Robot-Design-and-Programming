Cyclic guanosine monophosphate responses to atrial natriuretic factor , brain natriuretic peptide , but not P23582 , and the characterization of their receptors in rat medullary thick ascending limb . The effects of atrial natriuretic factor ( ANF ) , brain natriuretic peptide ( DB04899 ) , and P23582 ( P09543 ) on renal medullary thick ascending limb ( mTAL ) have not been fully understood . The aim of this study is to examine the second-messenger responses of rat mTAL to ANF , DB04899 , and P09543 . Characterizations of the ANF , DB04899 , and P09543 receptors in mTAL were also performed by radioligand studies . Results showed that ANF and DB04899 were both capable of eliciting cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) responses in mTAL . Conversely , no cGMP response was observed upon stimulation by P09543 in mTAL . The presence of ANF receptors was demonstrated by radioligand studies . One receptor site was found , and the Kd and maximum binding capacity were 4.0 +/- 0.45 nmol/L and 277.8 +/- 47.7 fmol/mg protein , respectively . DB04899 receptors were also found in mTAL , and ANF and DB04899 were sharing the same receptor . On the contrary , no P09543 receptor could be shown by radioligand studies . These results suggest that guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors ( atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-A [ P16066 ] ) specific for ANF and DB04899 are present in rat mTAL , while those for P09543 ( P20594 ) are absent . ANF and DB04899 but not P09543 act on mTAL to control water excretion .
