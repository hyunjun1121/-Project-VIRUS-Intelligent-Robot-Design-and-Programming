Stimulation of P05121 and adipokines by glucose in human adipose tissue in vitro . Adipokines such as P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , interleukin ( IL ) -8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha are elevated in patients with obesity , insulin resistance , and type 2 diabetes . In the present study , we investigated whether glucose affected the production of these adipokines in human adipose tissue in vitro . DB09341 ( up to 35mM ) increased secretion of P05121 ( p < 0.01 ) and P10145 ( p < 0.01 ) , but not P01375 , in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Half-maximal stimulatory concentration of glucose was about 1mM . DB01296 ( 5mM ) decreased production of P05121 ( p < 0.05 ) and P10145 ( p < 0.05 ) , indicating that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is not involved in the glucose-induced increment in adipokine secretion . The present data demonstrate that glucose increases P05121 and P10145 secretion . However , glucose concentrations above 5mM had no additional effects on adipokine secretion , suggesting that mechanisms other than diabetes/insulin resistance-related hyperglycemia may be involved in the observed elevation of these adipokines .
