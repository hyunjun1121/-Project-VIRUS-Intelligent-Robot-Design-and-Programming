Altered growth factor expression in the aging penis : the Brown-Norway rat model . The objective of the present study was to evaluate age-related changes in the protein and gene expression of modulators of erectile function ( nitric oxide [ NO ] and endothelin-1 [ ET-1 ] ) and growth factors such as transforming growth factor ( TGF-beta1 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in the penile tissue of Brown-Norway ( BN ) rats . Young and old BN male rats were euthanized , and the penile tissue was processed for immunohistochemical and molecular analyses . Total RNA was extracted , and an Access reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) system was used for messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression analysis . Immunohistochemical studies showed a decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) protein and an increased staining for ET-1 . Quantitative analysis of PCR products revealed decreased levels of P15692 mRNA expression in the old population of rats . The most significant decrease was detected between bands corresponding to splice forms 164 ( 21 % ) and 120 ( 18 % ) . The observed alterations in the gene expression of growth factors such as P15692 may contribute to the abnormal age-related morphological and physiological alterations in the erectile tissue .
