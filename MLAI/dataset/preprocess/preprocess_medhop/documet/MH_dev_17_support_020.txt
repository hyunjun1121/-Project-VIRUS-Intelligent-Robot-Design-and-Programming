Post-translational and cell type-specific regulation of P61073 expression by cytokines . We have investigated the regulation and function of the chemokine receptor P61073 on neutrophils . P61073 is hardly detectable on neutrophils in the peripheral blood . However , overnight culture strongly up-regulates P61073 expression on the cell surface . The functional activity of P61073 on cultured neutrophils was confirmed by stromal cell-derived factor ( SDF ) -induced migration and up-regulation of the integrins CD11b and CD11c . P61073 surface expression on neutrophils but not on lymphocytes and monocytes is rapidly down-regulated after stimulation with P01375 and P01579 , resulting in significantly decreased SDF-induced functional responses of neutrophils . In contrast to surface expression , P61073 mRNA expression was several-fold increased in cytokine-stimulated neutrophils , suggesting a post-translational regulation . By confocal microscopy we demonstrate that P61073 is internalized after stimulation with P01375 and P01579 . Tauhe down-modulation of P61073 surface expression in response to P01375 and P01579 was fully reversible after cytokine removal . Further , P61073 down-modulation could be completely blocked by hypertonic sucrose and significantly reduced by chlorpromazine indicating the involvement of clathrin-coated pits . Internalization of P61073 by cytokines in a cell type-specific manner is a novel and functionally important mechanism of chemokine receptor regulation .
