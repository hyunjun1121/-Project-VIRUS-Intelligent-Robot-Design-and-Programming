Vanadate induction of NF-kappaB involves O15111 beta and P45985 in macrophages . The present studies investigated the signaling pathways of vanadate , a vanadium ion with +5 oxidation state , to activate NF-kappaB transcription factor , a pivotal regulator of inflammatory responses . Treatment of macrophages with vanadate results in the activation of both NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) . The activity of a recently identified cellular kinase , O15111 -beta ( IKKbeta ) , was significantly elevated concomitant with the increased degradation of P25963 and enhanced NF-kappaB activity in cells exposed to vanadate . To determine whether the IKK pathway and JNK pathway are interconnected or bifurcate upon vanadate stimulation , cells were transfected with either a kinase inactive form of IKKbeta or a kinase inactive form of P45985 ( P45985 ) . Inactive IKKbeta was able to block vanadate-induced degradation of P25963 , yet it was unable to influence the activation of JNK by vanadate . Conversely , blockage of JNK activation by transfection of a kinase-inactive form of P45985 resulted in partially inhibition of vanadate-induced P25963 degradation . Both vanadate-induced degradation of P25963 and activation of JNK were potently inhibited by pretreatment of cells with DB06151 or dimercaprol . These results demonstrate that early activation of stress kinases or change of cellular redox states plays a key role in vanadate-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK .
