Influence of a 3-day regimen of azithromycin on the disposition kinetics of cyclosporine A in stable renal transplant patients . Some macrolide antibiotics have been shown to produce significant drug-drug interactions through the inhibition of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes . In renal transplant patients these interactions pose potentially serious problems for the safe administration of cyclosporine A ( Q13216 ) , a substrate of P08684 . The effects of azithromycin on Q13216 disposition kinetics were evaluated in eight stable renal transplant patients . Patients had been stabilized on individualized doses of Q13216 which remained unchanged throughout the study . DB00207 was administered for 3 days . Baseline measurements of Q13216 disposition kinetics were taken prior to azithromycin treatment ( study day 2 ) and after 3 days ( study day 5 ) of azithromycin treatment ( 500mg/day , orally ) . The key parameters of interest were the area under the Q13216 blood concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) measured for 24h after the morning dose of Q13216 on both days 2 and 5 , and the C(max) values of Q13216 . The geometric mean ratios ( GMRs ) of those parameters ( day 5/day 2 ) and their 90 % confidence intervals ( 90 % CI ) were 107 ( 98,116 ) and 119 ( 104,136 ) , respectively . The 7 % increase in exposure level and 19 % increase in peak plasma concentration are not likely to be clinically significant . It is concluded that azithromycin ( 500mg/dayx3 days ) does not alter the disposition kinetics of Q13216 in a clinically significant way , and that Q13216 dosage adjustments are not warranted in renal transplant patients taking these two drugs together .
