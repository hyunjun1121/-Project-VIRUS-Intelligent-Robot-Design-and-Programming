P08581 tyrosine kinase met is a substrate of the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase Q12913 . The receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) Q12913 ( CD148/PTP-eta ) has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth , differentiation , and transformation , and most recently has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene mutated in colon , lung , and breast cancers . We have generated constructs comprising the cytoplasmic segment of Q12913 fused to the maltose-binding protein to identify potential substrates and thereby suggest a physiological function for Q12913 . We have shown that the substrate-trapping mutant form of Q12913 interacted with a small subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from lysates of the human breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231 , T-47D , and T-47D/ DB00134 and have identified the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor DB00134 , the adapter protein Gab1 , and the junctional component O60716 as potential substrates . Following ligand stimulation , phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues in DB00134 induces mitogenic , motogenic , and morphogenic responses . When co-expressed in 293 cells , the full-length substrate-trapping mutant form of Q12913 formed a stable complex with the chimeric receptor colony stimulating factor 1 ( P04141 ) - DB00134 and wild type Q12913 dephosphorylated P04141 - DB00134 . Furthermore , we observed that Q12913 preferentially dephosphorylated a Gab1 binding site ( DB00135 (1349) ) and a COOH-terminal tyrosine implicated in morphogenesis ( DB00135 (1365) ) , whereas tyrosine residues in the activation loop of DB00134 ( DB00135 (1230) , DB00135 (1234) , and DB00135 (1235) ) were not preferred targets of the PTP . The ability of Q12913 preferentially to dephosphorylate particular tyrosine residues that are required for DB00134 -induced signaling suggests that Q12913 may function in controlling the specificity of signals induced by this PTK , rather than as a simple " off-switch " to counteract PTK activity .
