Regulation of porphyrin synthesis and photodynamic therapy in heavy metal intoxication . Protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) synthesis by malignant cells is successfully exploited for photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) following administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) and light irradiation . The influence of two environmental heavy metal poisons , lead and gallium , on PpIX-synthesis and DB00855 was studied in two neu-ronal cell lines , SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and PC12 pheochromocytoma . The heavy metal intoxication affected two of the heme-synthesis enzymes , ALA-dehydratase ( P13716 ) and porphobilinogen deaminase ( P08397 ) . The present results show that lead poisoning significantly decreased the P08397 cellular level and inhibited its enzymatic activity , whereas the effects of gallium were less prominent . Although , the protein levels were reduced , the mRNA levels of P08397 remained unchanged during metal intoxication . These findings show additional inhibitory activity of lead on top of its classical effect on P13716 . Proteasome activity was enhanced during lead treatment , as measured by the AMC fluorigenic proteasome assay . The reduction in P08397 levels was not a consequence of P08397 mRNA reduced synthesis , which remained unchanged as shown by RT-PCR analysis . As a result of the lead poisoning , marked alterations in the cell cycle were observed , including a decreased P55008 phase and an increased number of S phase cells . The efficacy of DB00855 was reduced in correlation with decreased activities of the enzymes during lead intoxication . We may conclude that lead poisoning adversely affects the outcome of ALA photodynamic therapy of cancer .
