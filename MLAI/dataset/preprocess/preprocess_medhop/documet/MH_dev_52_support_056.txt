Gamma-tocopherol , but not DB00163 , decreases proinflammatory eicosanoids and inflammation damage in rats . Gamma-tocopherol ( gammaT ) , the major form of vitamin E in U.S. diets , and its physiological metabolite 2 , 7 , 8-trimethyl-2-(beta-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman ( gamma-CEHC ) , in contrast to DB00163 ( alphaT ) , the primary vitamin E in supplements , inhibit cyclooxygenase-catalyzed synthesis of prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) in activated macrophages and epithelial cells . Here we report that in carrageenan-induced inflammation in male Wistar rats , administration of gammaT ( 33 or 100 mg/kg ) and gamma-CEHC ( 2 mg/pouch ) , but not alphaT ( 33 mg/kg ) , significantly reduced DB00917 synthesis at the site of inflammation . gammaT , but not alphaT , significantly inhibited the formation of leukotriene B4 , a potent chemotactic agent synthesized by the P09917 of neutrophils . Although gammaT had no effect on neutrophil infiltration , it significantly attenuated the partial loss of food consumption caused by inflammation-associated discomfort . Administration of gammaT led consistently to a significant reduction of inflammation-mediated increase in 8-isoprostane , a biomarker of lipid peroxidation . gammaT at 100 mg/kg reduced P01375 ( 65 % ;P=0.069 ) , total nitrate/nitrite ( 40 % ;P=0.1 ) , and lactate dehydrogenase activity ( 30 % ;P=0.067 ) . Collectively , gammaT inhibits proinflammatory DB00917 and LTB4 , decreases P01375 , and attenuates inflammation-mediated damage . These findings provide strong evidence that gammaT shows anti-inflammatory activities in vivo that may be important for human disease prevention and therapy .
