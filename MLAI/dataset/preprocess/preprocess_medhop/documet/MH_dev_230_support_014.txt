A novel mutation in the human complex I O75251 subunit associated with Leigh syndrome . Defects in DB00157 :ubiquinone oxidoreductase , the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain represents the most frequent cause of mitochondrial diseases and is associated with a wide clinical spectrum varying from severe lactic acidosis in infants to muscle weakness in adults . Here , we report a patient with Leigh syndrome ( LS ) , born to consanguineous parents , with severe complex I defect and a novel mutation in the O75251 gene subunit . The homozygous mutation at nucleotide ( nt ) 434 G > A resulted in the modification of the arginine 145 to histidine in a highly conserved region of the protein . Parents were heterozygous carriers for this mutation . The mutation was absent from over than 100 healthy controls from the same ethnic origin . Identifying nuclear mutations as a cause of respiratory chain disorders will enhance the possibility of prenatal diagnosis and help us to understand how moleculardefects can lead to complex I deficiency .
