Computer-aided design and synthesis of 5-substituted tryptamines and their pharmacology at the P28221 receptor : discovery of compounds with potential anti-migraine properties . The design and synthesis of a series of novel 5-substituted tryptamines with pharmacological activity at P28221 and other monoamine receptors is described . Structural modifications of N- and C-linked ( principally hydantoin ) analogues at the 5-position were synthesized and their pharmacological activities were utilized to deduce significant steric and electrostatic requirements of the P28221 and 5- Q13049 receptor subtypes . Conformations of the active molecules were computed which , when overlaid , suggested a pharmacophore hypothesis which was consistent with the affinity and selectivity measured at P28221 and 5- Q13049 receptors . This pharmacophore is composed of a protonated amine site , an aromatic site , a hydrophobic pocket , and two hydrogen-bonding sites . A " selectivity site " was also identified which , if occupied , induced sensitivity for P28221 over 5- Q13049 in this series of molecules . The development and use of the pharmacophore models in compound design is described . In addition , the physicochemical constraints of molecular size and hydrophobicity required for efficient oral absorption are discussed . Utilizing the pharmacophore model in conjunction with the physicochemical constraints of molecular size and log DpH7.4 led to the discovery of DB00315 ( 6 ) , a new selective P28221 agonist with good oral absorption and potential use in the treatment of migraine .
