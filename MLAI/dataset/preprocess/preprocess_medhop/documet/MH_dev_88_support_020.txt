Q9H244 receptor signalling towards P31749 proceeds through P08069 cross-talk and requires activation of Src , Pyk2 and Rap1 . Previously it was shown that stimulation of the Q9H244 receptor activates P31749 signalling in P13671 glioma cells [ K. Van Kolen and H. Slegers , J. Neurochem. 89 , 442. ] . In the present study , the mechanisms involved in this response were further elucidated . In cells transfected with the Gbetagamma-scavenger beta- O14965 / P25098 or Rap1GAPII , stimulation with 2MeSADP failed to enhance P31749 phosphorylation demonstrating that the signalling proceeds through Gbetagamma-subunits and Rap1 . Moreover , Rap1-GTP pull-down assays revealed that Q9H244 receptor stimulation induced a rapid activation of Rap1 . Treatment of cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and inhibition of Src and O14939 with Q99463 or 1-butanol , respectively , abrogated Q9H244 receptor-mediated activation of Rap1 and P31749 . In addition inhibition of PKCzeta decreased basal and 2MeSADP-stimulated phosphorylation of P31749 indicating a role for this PKC isoform in P31749 signalling . Although the increased P31749 phosphorylation was abolished in the presence of the P08069 tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 1024 , 2MeSADP did not significantly increase receptor phosphorylation . Nevertheless , phosphorylation of a 120 kDa P08069 -associated protein was observed . The latter protein was identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS as the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( Pyk2 ) that co-operates with Src in a O14939 -dependent manner . Consistent with the signalling towards Rap1 and P31749 , activation of Pyk2 was abrogated by Ca2+ chelation , inhibition of O14939 and P08069 tyrosine kinase activity . In conclusion , the data reveal a novel type of cross-talk between Q9H244 and P05019 receptors that proceeds through Gbetagamma- , Ca2+-and O14939 -dependent activation of the Pyk2/Src pathway resulting in GTP-loading of Rap1 required for an increased P31749 phosphorylation .
