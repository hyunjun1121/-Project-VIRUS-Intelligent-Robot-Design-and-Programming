DB06655 : clinical pharmacology and considerations for therapy . DB06655 is a United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) analog that is 97 % homologous to native human P0C6A0 . The additional 16-carbon fatty acid chain causes noncovalent binding to albumin , which slows absorption from the injection site and protects the molecule from degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 , allowing for protraction of action . Albumin binding and an elimination half-life of 13 hours combine to allow for once-daily dosing . DB06655 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day given as monotherapy for up to 52 weeks produced mean reductions in hemoglobin A1c ( A1C ) of 0.6-1.6 % ; combination therapy of liraglutide with oral antidiabetic agents demonstrated mean A1C reductions up to 1.5 % . The satiety effect of P43220 agonists and documented weight loss as great as 3.38 kg in clinical trials may make liraglutide ideal for obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Like other incretin-based agents , preliminary studies suggest liraglutide may also increase Î²-cell mass and function . Hypoglycemia is rare with liraglutide and tends to occur when used in combination with sulfonylureas ; liraglutide in combination with insulin is not yet FDA approved . The pharmacokinetic parameters of liraglutide are unaffected by age , sex , race , or ethnicity , and no special recommendations for altered dosing of liraglutide need apply to populations with hepatic or renal impairment . Results from clinical trials have not shown an increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer , pancreatitis , or poor cardiovascular outcomes with liraglutide treatment . Ongoing , long-term monitoring studies continue to evaluate the safety of liraglutide treatment in these outcomes .
