DB06288 promotes cognitive flexibility in rats : the role of P34969 receptors . The antagonism of P34969 receptors may contribute to the antidepressant and procognitive actions of the atypical antipsychotic drug , amisulpride . It has been previously demonstrated that the selective P34969 receptor antagonist reversed restraint stress-induced cognitive impairments in a rat model of frontal-dependent attentional set-shifting task ( ASST ) . Therefore , the first aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of amisulpride against stress-evoked cognitive inflexibility . The second goal was to elucidate whether the pro-cognitive effect of amisulpride could be due to the compound 's action at P34969 receptors . Rats repeatedly exposed ( 1 h daily for 7 days ) to restraint stress demonstrated impaired performance on the extra-dimensional ( ED ) set-shifting stage of the ASST . DB06288 ( 3 mg/kg ) given to stressed rats 30 min before testing reversed this restraint-induced cognitive inflexibility and improved ED performance of the unstressed control group . The P34969 receptor agonist , AS19 ( 10 mg/kg ) , abolished the pro-cognitive efficacy of amisulpride ( 3 mg/kg ) . The present study suggests that the antagonism of P34969 receptors may contribute to the mechanisms underlining the pro-cognitive action of amisulpride . These results may have therapeutic implications in frontal-like deficits associated with stress-related disorders .
