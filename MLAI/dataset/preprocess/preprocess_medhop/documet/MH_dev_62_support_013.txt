The cytotoxic effects of certolizumab pegol and DB06674 mediated by transmembrane tumor necrosis factor α . BACKGROUND : Anti-tumor necrosis factor α ( anti- P01375 -α ) agents have been successfully applied for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease , and other chronic inflammatory diseases . Not only the neutralization of soluble P01375 -α but also the effect on transmembrane P01375 -α is important mechanisms of action of anti- P01375 -α agents . This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of new anti- P01375 -α agents , certolizumab pegol and DB06674 , which are mediated by transmembrane P01375 -α . METHODS : Transmembrane P01375 -α-expressing Jurkat T cells that did not express P01375 receptors were used . The binding ability of each anti- P01375 -α agent to transmembrane P01375 -α , antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity , complement-dependent cytotoxicity , and the apoptotic effect were examined . RESULTS : DB08904 and DB06674 bound to transmembrane P01375 -α . Golimumab induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity , which was comparable to infliximab and adalimumab . However , certolizumab pegol did not induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity . DB08904 directly induced nonapoptotic cell death in transmembrane P01375 -α-expressing cells . Golimumab induced a weaker apoptotic effect than infliximab and adalimumab . CONCLUSIONS : The cytotoxic effects of anti- P01375 -α agents on P01375 -α-expressing cells are considered to be associated with the clinical effect of these agents on granulomatous diseases . The direct cytotoxic effect of certolizumab pegol on P01375 -α-producing cells may contribute to its clinical efficacy in Crohn 's disease . Golimumab may be less effective for granulomatous diseases .
