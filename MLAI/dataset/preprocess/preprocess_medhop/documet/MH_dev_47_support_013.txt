Retinoic acid receptors in retinoid responsive ovarian cancer cell lines detected by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription . The growth inhibitory effects of all-trans and 13-cis retinoic acid ( RA ) and of the synthetic retinoids DB02877 , DB02877 -ethylester and TTNN were studied on seven human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and one ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . Six of seven ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines were inhibited in their growth by RA and by synthetic retinoids in a dose dependent manner . No response to these substances was observed for the ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . The knowledge that RA and retinoids exert their action on the cells via nuclear receptors led us to examine the expression of P10276 , -beta and -gamma mRNA by these cell lines by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription . All cell lines expressed P10276 and -gamma mRNA and six of the eight cell lines were found to express additionally P10826 mRNA , among them the ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line . Our data indicate that there was no direct association between the presence of RAR subtype transcripts and the response to retinoids in ovarian cancer cell lines .
