Rizatriptan in migraineurs with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms : a double-blind trial . The objective and background is to confirm in a double-blind , placebo-controlled study the high DB00669 response rates we had previously reported in an open study in migraine patients with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms . In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study 80 migraineurs with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms were assigned to receive rizatriptan 10 mg wafer or placebo ( ratio 1:1 ) and treated for a single moderate or severe migraine attack . The primary endpoints were pain freedom at 2 h and total migraine freedom at 2 h . Secondary endpoints included pain relief , no associated symptoms and sustained pain freedom or relief . Significantly more patients reported pain freedom at 2 h after taking rizatriptan ( 54 % ) than after placebo ( 8 % ) ( therapeutic gain 46 % [ 28 % ; 64 % ] ; P < 0.001 ) . Similarly , significantly more patients reported total migraine freedom at 2 h after rizatriptan ( 51 % ) than after placebo ( 8 % ) ( therapeutic gain 43 % [ 26 % ; 61 % ] ; P < 0.001 ) . Rizatriptan was also more effective than placebo on most secondary endpoints . We confirm in a placebo-controlled study our previous data suggesting that the presence of unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms in migraineurs predicts a positive response to triptans , probably owing to intense trigeminal peripheral afferent activation which strongly recruits peripheral neurovascular P28222 /1D receptors . Acute and preventive pharmacological trials in migraine should focus also on this subset of migraine patients .
