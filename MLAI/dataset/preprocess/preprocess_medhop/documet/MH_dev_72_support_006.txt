DB09341 transporter-2 ( P11168 ) promoter mediated transgenic insulin production reduces hyperglycemia in diabetic mice . P01308 production afforded by hepatic gene therapy ( HGT ) retains promise as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes , but successful approaches have been limited . We employed a novel and previously untested promoter for this purpose , glucose transporter-2 ( P11168 ) to drive insulin production via delivery by recombinant adeno-associated virus ( rAAV ) . In vitro , the P11168 promoter was capable of robust glucose-responsive expression in transduced HepG2 human hepatoma cells . Therefore , rAAV constructs were designed to express the furin-cleavable human preproinsulin B10 gene , under the control of the murine P11168 promoter and packaged for delivery with rAAV expressing the type 5 capsid . DB00428 -induced diabetic mice were subjected to hepatic portal vein injection immediately followed by implantation of a sustained-release insulin pellet to allow time for transgenic expression . All mice injected with the rAAV5- P11168 -fHPIB10 virus remained euglycemic for up to 35 days post-injection , with 50 % euglycemic after 77 days post-injection . In contrast , mock-injected mice became hyperglycemic within 15 days post-injection following dissolution of the insulin pellet . Serum levels of both human insulin and C-peptide further confirmed successful transgenic delivery by the rAAV5- P11168 -fHPIB10 virus . These findings indicate that the P11168 promoter may be a potential candidate for regulating transgenic insulin production for hepatic insulin gene therapy in the treatment of type I diabetes .
