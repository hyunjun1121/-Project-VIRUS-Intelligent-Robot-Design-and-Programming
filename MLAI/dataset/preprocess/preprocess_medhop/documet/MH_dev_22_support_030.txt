Treating metastatic breast cancer with systemic chemotherapies : current trends and future perspectives . Treatment selection for metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) is guided by multiple factors , most importantly hormone receptor ( HR ) or P04626 expression , treatment history , and prognostic factors such as short disease-free interval , presence of visceral metastases , performance status , and degree of symptoms . Chemotherapy is indicated as initial therapy for patients with HR-negative disease and following failure of hormonal therapies in HR-positive disease . Patients treated with an anthracycline or a taxane in early-stage settings may no longer be candidates for those drugs in MBC , thus underscoring the need for alternative options . Sequential single-agent therapy or combination therapy are viable strategies . Trials have shown that ixabepilone plus capecitabine significantly improves progression-free survival compared with capecitabine alone in anthracycline- or taxane-pretreated or -resistant patients , and single-agent eribulin improves survival compared with the physician 's choice of treatment in patients treated previously with at least two regimens for MBC . Regardless of the regimen , proactive management to detect treatment-related adverse events in a timely manner remains important for ensuring effective delivery of treatment . Many promising investigational agents are in development , including DB05773 ( trastuzumab emtansine ) and pertuzumab for P04626 -positive disease , as well as P09874 ( poly [ adenosine diphosphate ribose ] polymerase-1 ) inhibitors and cetuximab for triple-negative disease . In addition , new options for the treatment of MBC following failure of an anthracycline and a taxane promise to improve patient outcomes . Nurses should remain vigilant for adverse events and remember that the goal of treatment remains control of the disease and palliation .
