Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) stimulates aldosterone secretion from human adrenocortical cells via CCK2 receptors coupled to the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A signaling cascade . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) IS a regulatory peptide that acts via two receptor subtypes , P32238 and P32239 . RT-PCR demonstrated the expression of both P32238 and P32239 in the zona glomerulosa ( ZG ) , but not zona fasciculata-reticularis cells of the human adrenal cortex . CCK and the P32239 agonist pentagastrin enhanced basal aldosterone secretion from ZG cells without affecting cortisol production from zona fasciculata-reticularis cells . The aldosterone response to CCK and pentagastrin was suppressed by a P32239 antagonist , but not by a P32238 antagonist . DB00183 evoked a sizeable DB02527 , but not inositol triphosphate , response from ZG cells , whereas CCK plus P32239 antagonist was ineffective . The DB02527 response to pentagastrin was abrogated by P32239 antagonist or the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ-22536 , and the aldosterone response was abolished by both SQ-22536 and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 . Both CCK and pentagastrin increased steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mRNA expression in ZG cells ; the effect was abrogated by P32239 antagonist . We conclude that CCK exerts secretagogue action on human ZG cells , acting through CCK2-Rs coupled to the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A signaling cascade , which , in turn , stimulates the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein , the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis .
