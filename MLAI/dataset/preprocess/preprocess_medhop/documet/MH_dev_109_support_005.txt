Inhibition of cholinergic signaling causes apoptosis in human bronchioalveolar carcinoma . Recent case-controlled clinical studies show that bronchioalveolar carcinomas ( BAC ) are correlated with smoking . DB00184 , the addictive component of cigarettes , accelerates cell proliferation through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChR ) . In this study , we show that human BACs produce acetylcholine ( ACh ) and contain several cholinergic factors including acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) , choline transporter 1 ( Q9GZV3 , Q9GZV3 ) , vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( Q16572 , Q16572 ) , and nACh receptors ( AChRs , CHRNAs ) . DB00184 increased the production of ACh in human BACs , and ACh acts as a growth factor for these cells . DB00184 -induced ACh production was mediated by α7- , α3β2- , and β3-nAChRs , P28329 and Q16572 pathways . We observed that nicotine upregulated P28329 and Q16572 . Therefore , we conjectured that Q16572 antagonists , such as vesamicol , may suppress the growth of human BACs . Vesamicol induced potent apoptosis of human BACs in cell culture and nude mice models . Vesamicol did not have any effect on P01133 or insulin-like growth factor-II-induced growth of human BACs. siRNA-mediated attenuation of Q16572 reversed the apoptotic activity of vesamicol . We also observed that vesamicol inhibited Akt phosphorylation during cell death and that overexpression of constitutively active Akt reversed the apoptotic activity of vesamicol . Taken together , our results suggested that disruption of nicotine-induced cholinergic signaling by agents such as vesamicol may have applications in BAC therapy .
