Imatinib has the potential to exert its antileukemia effects by down-regulating Q12809 K+ channels in chronic myelogenous leukemia . Imatinib is a powerful protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitor that specifically targets P11274 - P00519 , P10721 , and P09619 kinases , has become the current first-line therapy for all newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Beside PTKs , PTK inhibitors alter the activity of a large number of voltage-dependent ion channels . Q12809 K(+) channels are highly expressed in leukemia cells and appear of exceptional importance in favoring leukemogenesis . The present study explored a possible regulatory effect of imatinib upon Q12809 K(+) channels as a means to uncover new molecular events involved in the antileukemic activity of this PTK inhibitor in CML . The results demonstrated that Q12809 was highly detected in K562 cells and primary CML cells , and down-regulated by imatinib at mRNA and protein levels . Furthermore , imatinib markedly reduced hERG currents in HEK293T-hERG cells , this effect was accompanied by inhibition of CML cell proliferation and apoptosis , as well as suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) secretion . Moreover , these antileukemia effects of imatinib were potentiated by E-4031 , a specific Q12809 inhibitor . Together , these results provide evidence of a novel potential molecular mechanism of antileukemic activities by imatinib which , independent of targeting tyrosine kinase , highlight Q12809 K(+) channels as a therapeutic target for CML treatment .
