Reduced toll-like receptor 4 and DB05875 gene expression is associated with airway bacterial colonization in children . Neuro-immune interactions are increasingly relevant to human health and disease . The neuropeptide Substance P also has antibacterial activity and bears similarities to the innate immune antibacterial defensins . This suggests possible co-regulation of neuropeptide and innate immune mediators . In this study , non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) was performed on 69 children . BAL was examined for cellular profile , microbiology ( bacteria , virus ) and gene expression for TLRs 2 , 3 , 4 ; chemokine receptors ( P51677 , P51681 , P25024 ) ; neurotrophins and neurokinin genes ( P20366 , Q9UHF0 , P80511 , P01138 ) . In children with bacterial colonization ( n=10 ) there was an airway inflammatory response with increased BAL neutrophils , P10145 protein , and P25024 expression . Substance P ( P20366 ) and O00206 RNA expression were reduced in children with bacterial colonization . O15455 mRNA was increased in 7.2 % ( n=5 ) children with rhinovirus , and there was a non-significant trend to increased O60603 . There is evidence for co-regulation of neurokinin ( P20366 ) and O00206 gene expression in airway cells from children with airway bacterial colonization and their reduced expression may be associated with an impaired bacterial clearance .
