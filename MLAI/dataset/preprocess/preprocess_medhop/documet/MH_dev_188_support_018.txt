DB04868 for the frontline treatment of Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia . DB04868 has a higher binding affinity and selectivity for P11274 - P00519 with respect to imatinib and is an effective treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) after imatinib failure . In a phase 2 study , 73 early chronic-phase , untreated , Ph(+) CML patients , received nilotinib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily . The primary endpoint was the complete cytogenetic response ( CCgR ) rate at 1 year . With a median follow-up of 15 months , the CCgR rate at 1 year was 96 % , and the major molecular response rate 85 % . Responses were rapid , with 78 % CCgR and 52 % major molecular response at 3 months . During the first year , the treatment was interrupted at least once in 38 patients ( 52 % ) . The mean daily dose ranged between 600 and 800 mg in 74 % of patients , 400 and 599 mg in 18 % of patients , and was less than 400 mg in 8 % of patients . Dose interruptions were mainly due to nonhematologic and biochemical side effects . Myelosuppression was irrelevant . One patient progressed to blastic crisis after 6 months ; one went off-treatment for lipase increase grade 4 ( no pancreatitis ) . DB04868 is safe and very active in early chronic-phase CML . These data support a role for nilotinib for the frontline treatment of CML . This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00481052 .
