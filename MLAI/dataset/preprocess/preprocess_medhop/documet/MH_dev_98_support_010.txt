P14210 and DB01277 synergize with SDF-1α in promoting migration of myeloma cells by cooperative activation of P38936 -activated kinase . Stromal-derived factor ( SDF ) -1α , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 and hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) are potent mediators of cell migration . We studied the effect of combinations of these cytokines on the migration of myeloma cells . When SDF-1α was combined with either P14210 or DB01277 , we found a striking synergy in the cytokines ' ability to guide cells across a transwell membrane . Between P14210 and DB01277 there was no cooperativity . However , the effects of P14210 and DB01277 were not redundant . P14210 and P48061 caused concentration gradient-directed migration , as opposed to DB01277 , which apparently caused randomly directed cell movement . The SDF-1α-driven migration of JJN-3 cells , a myeloma cell line secreting large amounts of P14210 , was reduced when JJN-3 cells were given an inhibitor of the P08581 , demonstrating a cooperative activity between autocrine P14210 and exogenous SDF-1α . There was a clear positive correlation between the degree of cytokine-induced migration and phosphorylation of P38936 -activated kinase ( PAK ) both in primary myeloma cells and in cell lines including Q16352 -6 and IH-1 . Downregulation of PAK with small interfering RNA in Q16352 -6 cells resulted in decreased cytokine-driven migration . This study shows synergy between SDF-1α and P14210 / DB01277 in inducing migration of myeloma cells , yet each cytokine has distinct properties in the way it regulates cell migration . These findings are likely to be of clinical relevance because multiple myeloma cells are located in an environment containing P14210 and DB01277 and are exposed to an SDF-1α gradient between the bone marrow and peripheral blood .
