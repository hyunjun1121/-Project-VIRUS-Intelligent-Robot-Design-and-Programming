DB00428 diabetes and the expression of P11166 at the brush border and basolateral membranes of intestinal enterocytes . Changes in membrane expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter ( P13866 ) and glucose transporter isoform ( P11168 ) protein have been implicated in the increased intestinal glucose transport in streptozotocin-diabetes . The possible involvement of P11166 in the transport response , however , has not previously been studied . Using confocal microscopy on tissue sections and Western blotting of purified brush border membrane ( BBM ) and basolateral membrane ( BLM ) , we have examined enterocyte expression of P11166 in untreated and in 1 and 21 day streptozotocin diabetic rats . In control enterocytes , P11166 was absent at the BBM and detected at low levels at the BLM . Diabetes resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increased expression of P11166 at the BLM and the protein could also be readily detected at the BBM . P01308 treatment of diabetic rats increased P11166 level at the BBM but was without effect on expression of the protein at the BLM .
