Low ethanol concentration alters P30532 RNA levels during early human development . DB00898 use is common and consumption during pregnancy has been shown to lead to a myriad of physical and neurologic abnormalities commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder . Substance addiction , which includes alcohol , has been shown to involve the major nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit P30532 . Using human embryonic stem cells as a model of early human development , we show that low concentrations of ethanol ( 20mM ) can alter the expression of P30532 . Changes in P30532 expression is linked to altered GABA and DB01221 receptor expression , as well as abnormal development of the frontal cortex . These results suggest that alcohol exposure can alter early neurologic development , which may favor addiction and other developmental abnormalities in unborn children .
