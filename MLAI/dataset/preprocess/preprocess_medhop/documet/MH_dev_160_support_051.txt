Successful infliximab treatment of posterior scleritis in a 13-year-old child refractory to other immunosuppressive therapy . BACKGROUND : Posterior scleritis is a potentially blinding inflammatory disorder rarely seen in children . Standard care consists of systemic administration of steroids and immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or ciclosporin A . We describe the case of a young girl suffering from therapy refractory posterior scleritis successfully treated with the tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) inhibitor infliximab . METHODS : This study was an interventional case report . The medical chart of a 13-year-old child treated with infliximab ( 5 mg/kg , 10 applications at a 4-8 week interval ) was reviewed for changes of visual acuity , fundoscopy , optic choherence tomography , ultrasound imaging , and adverse events . RESULTS : DB00065 therapy ( 5 mg/kg , 10 applications at a 4-8 week interval ) led to a long-term remission of posterior scleritis after unsuccessful therapy with high dose prednisolone , methotrexate , and ciclosporin A . To date no side effects have been reported . CONCLUSIONS : Administration of infliximab may be considered under appropriate circumstances to treat children with posterior scleritis .
