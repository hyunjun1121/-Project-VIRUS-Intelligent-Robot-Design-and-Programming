Salmonid Tollip and MyD88 factors can functionally replace their mammalian orthologues in TLR-mediated trout P0DJI8 promoter activation . Many functional details of the piscine Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signal-mediated activation of immune defense are still elusive . We used an established reconstitution system of mammalian TLR signaling to examine if this system would allow for pathogen-dependent promoter activation of the serum amyloid A ( P0DJI8 ) -encoding gene from rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) and if the key mediators MyD88 and Tollip from trout can functionally substitute for their mammalian orthologues . Cells of the established human embryonic kidney line P29320 -293 were transiently co-transfected with vectors expressing bovine O60603 or O00206 factors and a reporter gene driven by the promoter of the trout P0DJI8 gene . Escherichia coli stimulation increased reporter gene expression more than 3-fold . Deletion series and point mutations identified in the proximal P0DJI8 promoter a composite overlapping binding site for NF-κB and P49715 factors as crucial for promoter activation . Overexpression of NF-κB p65 , but not of p50 or different members of the P49715 factor family proved this factor as an essential driver for P0DJI8 expression . Overexpression of a transdominant-negative mutant of the trout MyD88 factor reduced TLR-mediated P0DJI8 promoter activation confirming functional conservation of its TIR domain . Overexpression of the Tollip factor from trout also quenched TLR-mediated NF-κB and O00206 -mediated P0DJI8 promoter activation . The MyD88 mutant and Tollip expression studies confirm the functional homology of both piscine factors and their mammalian counterparts . We provide for the first time evidence that also the Tollip-mediated negative loop of TLR signaling may be conserved in non-mammalian organisms .
