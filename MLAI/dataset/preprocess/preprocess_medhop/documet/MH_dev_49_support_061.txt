Contribution of the kidney to metabolic clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide . To quantify the role of the kidney in whole body metabolic clearance rate ( P08235 ) from plasma of atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , synthetic alpha-human P01160 -(1-28) was infused at 200 ng/min to steady-state conditions in chronically instrumented one-kidney conscious dogs . Clearances were measured in dogs with a normally filtering kidney and they were also measured after the glomerular filtration rate ( Q92565 ) was reduced to close to zero by acutely inflating a cuff around the renal artery ( P31749 ) , which resulted in minimal urine production and renal blood flow reduction to 59 % of the resting level . In normal dogs , P08235 was 1,090 +/- 134 ml/min with renal clearance rate ( RCR ) contributing only 13.9 % . After P31749 , P08235 fell to 864 +/- 151 ml/min , due in part to a fall in RCR ( -41.5 +/- 12.9 ml/min ) , but mostly due to a fall in " rest of the body " ( total renal ) clearance of P01160 . The reduced Q92565 accounted for virtually all the fall in RCR . Normal plasma P01160 half-life was 59.6 +/- 7.9 s . In conclusion , P08235 of P01160 was very high , approaching the cardiac output , suggesting that most of P01160 is cleared in one circulation through peripheral tissues . Q92565 contributed significantly to RCR ( approximately 30 % ) but the contribution of the kidney to whole body P08235 was small relative to rest of the body clearance of P01160 .
