Gene polymorphisms in association with emerging cardiovascular risk markers in adult women . BACKGROUND : Evidence on the associations of emerging cardiovascular disease risk factors/markers with genes may help identify intermediate pathways of disease susceptibility in the general population . This population-based study is aimed to determine the presence of associations between a wide array of genetic variants and emerging cardiovascular risk markers among adult US women . METHODS : The current analysis was performed among the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III phase 2 samples of adult women aged 17 years and older ( sample size n = 3409 ) . Fourteen candidate genes within P07550 , P13945 , CAT , CRP , F2 , P12259 , P02675 , P05106 , P42898 , NOS3 , P27169 , P37231 , O00206 , and P01375 were examined for associations with emerging cardiovascular risk markers such as serum P02741 , homocysteine , uric acid , and plasma fibrinogen . Linear regression models were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.0 . The covariates included age , race/ethnicity , education , menopausal status , female hormone use , aspirin use , and lifestyle factors . RESULTS : In covariate-adjusted models , serum P02741 concentrations were significantly ( P value controlling for false-discovery rate < or = 0.05 ) associated with polymorphisms in CRP ( rs3093058 , rs1205 ) , P42898 ( rs1801131 ) , and P13945 ( rs4994 ) . Serum homocysteine levels were significantly associated with P42898 ( rs1801133 ) . CONCLUSION : The significant associations between certain gene variants with concentration variations in serum P02741 and homocysteine among adult women need to be confirmed in further genetic association studies .
