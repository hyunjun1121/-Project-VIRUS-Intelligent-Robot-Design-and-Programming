Growth factor receptor/steroid receptor cross talk in trastuzumab-treated breast cancer . Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) including trastuzumab has revolutionized the management of P04626 -positive breast cancer . Recent evaluation of clinical trial data suggests that a subset of P04626 /ER double-positive cancers may not receive significant benefit from the TKI therapy . Here we investigate the cross talk between P04626 and ER in breast cancer and monitor the effect of trastuzumab on the tyrosine kinase effector transcription factor Myc . In P04626 -positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab , steroid receptor-negative status ( ER and PR negative ) of pre-treatment biopsies predicted pathological complete response ( pCR ) ( n=31 patients , P=0.0486 ) , whereas elevated Myc protein inversely associated with pCR ( P=0.0446 ) . Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identified the corepressor Q9Y618 as a novel Myc-interacting protein . DB00072 treatment enhanced Myc- Q9Y618 interactions in P04626 -overexpressing breast cancer cells ( LCC1 ) and inhibited expression of the Myc target gene survivin . In P04626 -low , ER-positive steroid-dominant cells ( MCF7 ) , trastuzumab therapy repressed Myc- Q9Y618 interactions and upregulated survivin expression . DB00072 treatment induced ER-CBP interactions , enhanced ER transcriptional activity and upregulated expression of the ER target gene pS2 . The absence of pS2 expression in pre-treatment biopsies predicted pCR to neoadjuvant trastuzumab in breast cancer patients ( n=25 , P=0.0089 ) and pS2 expression associated with residual cancer burden ( P=0.0196 ) . Furthermore , metastatic tissues from patients who had failed trastuzumab therapy were pS2 positive . In P04626 -overexpressing cells , trastuzumab treatment can repress Myc transcriptional activity and clinical response is favorable . However , with co-expression of the steroid pathway , this inhibition is lost and response to treatment is often poor .
