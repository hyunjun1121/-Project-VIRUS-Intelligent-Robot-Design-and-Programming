Discovery of ( 2E ) -3-{2-butyl-1-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}-N-hydroxyacrylamide ( DB05223 ) , an orally active histone deacetylase inhibitor with a superior preclinical profile . A series of 3-(1,2-disubstituted-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)-N-hydroxyacrylamides ( 1 ) were designed and synthesized as HDAC inhibitors . Extensive SARs have been established for in vitro potency ( Q13547 enzyme and COLO 205 cellular IC(50) ) , liver microsomal stability ( t(1/2) ) , cytochrome P450 inhibitory ( 3A4 IC(50) ) , and clogP , among others . These parameters were fine-tuned by carefully adjusting the substituents at positions 1 and 2 of the benzimidazole ring . After comprehensive in vitro and in vivo profiling of the selected compounds , DB05223 ( 3 ) was identified as a preclinical development candidate . 3 is a potent pan-HDAC inhibitor with excellent druglike properties , is highly efficacious in in vivo tumor models ( HCT-116 , PC-3 , A2780 , MV4-11 , Ramos ) , and has high and dose-proportional oral exposures and very good ADME , safety , and pharmaceutical properties . When orally dosed to tumor-bearing mice , 3 is enriched in tumor tissue which may contribute to its potent antitumor activity and prolonged duration of action . 3 is currently being tested in phase I and phase II clinical trials .
