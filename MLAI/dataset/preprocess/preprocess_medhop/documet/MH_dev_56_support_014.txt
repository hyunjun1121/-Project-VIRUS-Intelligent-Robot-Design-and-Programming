DB00005 reduces acute tissue injury and mortality associated to zymosan-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . It has been well demonstrated that P01375 is integral to the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) . In this study , we investigate the effects of etanercept ( 10 mg/kg , s.c. ) , a specific P01375 -soluble inhibitor , on the acute phase and late mortality in a murine model of MODS of nonseptic origin induced by zymosan ( 500 mg/kg , suspended in saline solution , i.p. ) . DB00005 was administered 1 h after the injection of zymosan . Animals were killed after 18 h . In another set of experiments , mice were monitored for systemic toxicity , loss of body weight , and mortality for 12 days . Sham-treated and P01375 receptor 1 ( P19438 ) -deficient animals were used as control . Treatment of mice with DB00005 and P19438 gene deletion decreased the peritoneal exudation and the migration of neutrophils caused by zymosan . In addition , pharmacological and genetic neutralization of P01375 attenuated pancreas and ileum injury ( histology ) , the increase in myeloperoxidase activity in the ileum and in the lung , and the formation of P01375 and IL-1beta . Immunohistochemical analysis for P01375 , transforming growth factor beta , and vascular endothelial growth factor revealed a positive staining in pancreas and ileum sections . The degree of immunostaining was markedly reduced after etanercept treatment and in P19438 knockout mice . Furthermore , P01375 neutralization decreased the potent apoptotic stimulus induced by zymosan . All of these findings ultimately led to an amelioration of organ functions at 18 h and to a better survival rate at 12 days . Therefore , we demonstrate that etanercept reduces acute tissue injury and mortality associated to MODS of nonseptic origin in mice .
