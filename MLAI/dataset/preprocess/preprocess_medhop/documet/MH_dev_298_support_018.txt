Phase I dose-escalation study of aflibercept in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours . BACKGROUND : This phase I cohort study investigated aflibercept ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) trap ) plus docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours . METHODS : Patients received intravenous aflibercept 4 , 5 , or 6 mg kg(-1) with docetaxel and cisplatin ( 75 mg m(-2) each ) on day 1 of a 3-week cycle until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity . Primary objectives were determining cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) and the aflibercept recommended phase II trial dose ( RP2D ) for this combination . RESULTS : During the dose-escalation phase ( n=16 ) , there were two DLTs of febrile neutropenia ( at 4 and 5 mg kg(-1) ) . P09919 prophylaxis was subsequently recommended . The RP2D of aflibercept was established at 6 mg kg(-1) and administered to 14 additional patients . The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events ( AEs ) were neutropenia ( 43.3 % ) , stomatitis ( 20.0 % ) , asthenia/fatigue ( 20.0 % ) , and hypertension ( 16.7 % ) . All-grade AEs associated with P15692 blockade included epistaxis ( 83.3 % ) , dysphonia ( 70.0 % ) , proteinuria ( 53.3 % ) , and hypertension ( 50.0 % ) . There were five partial responses ( 16.7 % ) and 18 cases of stable disease ( 60.0 % ) ( lasting > 3 months in 10 patients ) . There were no pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interactions between the three drugs . CONCLUSION : DB08885 6 mg kg(-1) with docetaxel and cisplatin 75 mg m(-2) every 3 weeks is the RP2D based on tolerability , antitumour activity , and PKs .
