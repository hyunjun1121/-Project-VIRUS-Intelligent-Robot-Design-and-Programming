Efficacy and safety of erlotinib HCl , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 / P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor , in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma : results from a phase II multicenter study . The aim of this single-arm , phase II study was to estimate the tumor response rate and safety profile of erlotinib HCl ( erlotinib , Tarceva , DB00530 ) monotherapy in patients with refractory , recurrent , P00533 / P00533 -positive epithelial ovarian tumors , who had failed prior taxane and/or platinum-based chemotherapy . Thirty-four patients received 150 mg erlotinib orally once daily for up to 48 weeks or until disease progression or dose-limiting toxicity . Two patients had partial responses , lasting 8+ and 17 weeks , giving an objective response rate of 6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.7-19.7 % ) . Fifteen patients ( 44 % ) had stable disease , and 17 patients ( 50 % ) had progressive disease . Median overall survival was 8 months ( 95 % CI , 5.7-12.7 months ) , with a 1-year survival rate of 35.3 % ( 95 % CI , 19.8-53.5 % ) . Patients with rash survived significantly longer than those without ( P= 0.009 ) , correlating with rash grade . Erlotinib was generally well tolerated . The most frequent erlotinib-related adverse events were rash ( 68 % ) and diarrhea ( 38 % ) . Erlotinib had marginal activity but was generally well tolerated . The safety profile appears more favorable than typically experienced with standard chemotherapeutic agents , which is encouraging in these heavily pretreated patients . Combination of erlotinib with chemotherapy or other targeted agents should be considered .
