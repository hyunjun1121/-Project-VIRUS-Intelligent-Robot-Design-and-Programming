Tumor-derived exosomes promote tumor progression and T-cell dysfunction through the regulation of enriched exosomal microRNAs in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Tumor-derived exosomes contain biologically active proteins and messenger and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) . These particles serve as vehicles of intercellular communication and are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis and immune escape . Here , we isolated 30-100 nm exosomes from the serum of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) or the supernatant of TW03 cells . Increased circulating exosome concentrations were correlated with advanced lymphoid node stage and poor prognosis in NPC patients ( P < 0.05 ) . TW03-derived exosomes impaired T-cell function by inhibiting T-cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 differentiation and promoting Treg induction by NPC cells in vitro . These results are associated with decreases in P29323 , P42224 , and P40763 phosphorylation and increases in P42229 phosphorylation in exosome-stimulated T-cells . TW03-derived exosomes increased the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β , P05231 , and P22301 but decreased IFNγ , P60568 , and Q16552 release from P01730 + or CD8+ T-cells . Furthermore , five commonly over-expressed miRNAs were identified in the exosomes from patient sera or NPC cells : hsa-miR-24-3p , hsa-miR-891a , hsa-miR-106a-5p , hsa-miR-20a-5p , and hsa-miR-1908 . These over-expressed miRNA clusters down-regulated the Q9P0L2 signaling pathway to alter cell proliferation and differentiation . Overall , these observations reveal the clinical relevance and prognostic value of tumor-derived exosomes and identify a unique intercellular mechanism mediated by tumor-derived exosomes to modulate T-cell function in NPC .
