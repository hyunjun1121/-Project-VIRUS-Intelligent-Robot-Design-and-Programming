DB00065 : mechanism of action beyond P01375 neutralization in inflammatory bowel disease . DB00065 , a chimeric antibody to tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , holds much promise for the treatment of patients with Crohn 's disease . On the cellular level , infliximab affects survival and , as presented by Agnholt et al. in this issue of the journal , inhibits GM- P04141 ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) production by intestinal T lymphocytes . Future studies will reveal whether the pro-apoptotic effect of infliximab is linked to its inhibition of endogenous GM- P04141 expression in T cells . Treatment of Crohn 's disease , a severe chronic intestinal disorder , may at times be challenging as it can be refractory to routine therapy . Among novel therapeutic strategies , agents that neutralize tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) are of particular interest because of the crucial role of P01375 in sustaining chronic mucosal inflammation . The exact mechanism of the anti- P01375 action , apart from direct activity that neutralizes cytokines , is not fully understood . Cellular effects of P01375 neutralizing treatment include an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of intestinal mucosal T cells . A novel pathway of anti- P01375 interaction with T cells has been presented in the current issue of this journal . Agnholt et al. have found that in-vivo or in-vitro administration of infliximab , a chimeric antibody to P01375 , resulted in a decreased production of GM- P04141 ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) by T cells . DB00065 related down-regulation of P01375 induced GM- P04141 expression may be one of the mechanisms by which this drug increases the rate of apoptosis in T cells .
