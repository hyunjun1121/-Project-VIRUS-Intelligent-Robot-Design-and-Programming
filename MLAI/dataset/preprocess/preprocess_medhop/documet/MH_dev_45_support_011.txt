Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signaling promotes apoptosis of primary effusion lymphoma cells . PURPOSE : Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase ( P19957 '-kinase ) can be activated by the P04264 protein of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus ( KSHV ) . However , the role of P19957 '-kinase in KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) is not known . To assess this , we studied survival and apoptosis in PEL cell lines following inhibition of P19957 '-kinase . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Constitutive activation of several targets of P19957 -kinase and apoptotic proteins were determined by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies . We used LY294002 to block P19957 '-kinase/AKT activation and assess apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis . RESULTS : Blocking P19957 '-kinase induced apoptosis in PEL cells , including BC1 , BC3 , BCBL1 , and HBL6 , whereas BCP1 was refractory to LY294002-induced apoptosis . LY294002-induced apoptosis did not seem to involve Fas/Fas-L but had an additive effect to CH11-mediated apoptosis . We also show that AKT/ P31749 is constitutively activated in all PELs and treatment with LY294002 causes complete dephosphorylation in all cell lines except BCP1 where a residual AKT phosphorylation remained after 24 hours of treatment . Q12778 and GSK3 were also constitutively phosphorylated in PELs and treatment with LY294002 caused their dephosphorylation . Although inhibition of P19957 '-kinase induced cleavage of P55957 in all cell lines , cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria and caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated in LY294002-induced apoptotic BC1 but not in resistant BCP1 . Similarly , P98170 , a target of AKT , was down-regulated after LY294002 treatment only in sensitive PEL cells . CONCLUSIONS : Our data show that the P19957 '-kinase pathway plays a major role in survival of PEL cells and suggest that this cascade may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in primary effusion lymphomas .
