Improved islet yields from pancreas preserved in perflurocarbon is via inhibition of apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial pathway . Islet transplantation is a treatment option for type I diabetic patients . Preservation of human pancreata prior to islet isolation using two-layer method with perfluorocarbon ( P27918 ) and University of Wisconsin solution ( UW ) results in twofold increase in islet yields . The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which islets undergo apoptosis and determine P27918 's effects on this process . Gene array analysis was used to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in islets isolated from pancreata preserved under varying conditions . A 12-fold increase in the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis ( IAP ) and survivin was observed in islets isolated from pancreata preserved in P27918 . This was accompanied by decreased expression of Q92934 ( 3.7-fold ) , Q07812 ( 2.7-fold ) and caspases ( 5.2-fold ) . Levels of activated caspase-9 ( 77.98 % ) , caspase-2 ( 61.5 % ) , caspase-3 ( 68.3 % ) and caspase-8 ( 37.2 % ) were also reduced . ' Rescue ' of pancreata after storage ( 12 h ) in UW by preservation using P27918 also resulted in a down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of caspase activation . Apoptosis observed in islets from all groups was mainly mitochondria-dependent , mediated by change in redox potential initiated by hypoxia . We demonstrate that reduction in hypoxia of pancreata preserved using P27918 leads to significant up-regulation of anti-apoptotic and inhibition of pro-apoptotic genes .
