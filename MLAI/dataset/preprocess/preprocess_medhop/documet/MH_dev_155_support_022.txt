Sympathetic neurons express and secrete P08253 and P50281 to control nerve sprouting via pro- P01138 conversion . Recently , we have shown that high frequency electrical field stimulation ( HFES ) of sympathetic neurons ( SN ) induces nerve sprouting by up-regulation of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) which targets the tyrosine kinase A receptor ( TrkA ) in an autocrine/paracrine manner . There is increasing evidence that matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) is not only involved in extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) turnover but may also exert beneficial effects during neuronal growth . Therefore , this study aimed to investigate the regulation and function of P08253 and its major activator membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) as well its inhibitor P01033 in SN under conditions of HFES . Moreover , we analyzed molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effect of losartan , an angiotensin II type I receptor ( O00400 )blocker on HFES-induced nerve sprouting . Cell cultures of SN from the superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) of neonatal rats were electrically stimulated for 48 h with a frequency of 5 or 50 Hz . HFES increased P08253 and P50281 mRNA and protein expression , whereas P01033 expression remained unchanged . Under conditions of HFES , we observed a shift from pro- to active- P08253 indicating an increase in P08253 enzyme activity . Specific pharmacological P08253 inhibition contributed to an increase in pro- P01138 amount in the cell culture supernatant and significantly reduced HFES-induced neurite outgrowth . Losartan abolished HFES-induced nerve sprouting in a significant manner by preventing HFES-induced P01138 , P08253 , and P50281 up-regulation . In summary , specific P08253 blockade prevents sympathetic nerve sprouting ( SNS ) by inhibition of pro- P01138 conversion while losartan abolishes HFES-induced SNS by reducing total P01138 , P08253 and P50281 expression .
