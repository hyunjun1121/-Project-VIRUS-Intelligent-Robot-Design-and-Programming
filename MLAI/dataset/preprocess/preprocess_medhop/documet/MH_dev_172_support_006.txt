A conserved mechanism for gating in an ionotropic glutamate receptor . Ionotropic glutamate receptor ( iGluR ) channels control synaptic activity . The crystallographic structure of P42262 , the prototypical iGluR , reveals a clamshell-like ligand-binding domain ( LBD ) that closes in the presence of glutamate to open a gate on the pore lining α-helix . How LBD closure leads to gate opening remains unclear . Here , we show that bending the pore helix at a highly conserved alanine residue ( Ala-621 ) below the gate is responsible for channel opening . Substituting Ala-621 with the smaller more flexible glycine resulted in a basally active , nondesensitizing channel with ∼39-fold increase in glutamate potency without affecting surface expression or binding . On P42262 (A621G) , the partial agonist kainate showed efficacy similar to a full agonist , and competitive antagonists CNQX and DB03759 acted as a partial agonists . DB00134 -629 in P42262 sits above the gate and is critical in transmitting LBD closure to the gate . Substituting DB00134 -629 with the flexible glycine resulted in reduced channel activity and glutamate potency . The pore regions in potassium channels are structurally similar to iGluRs . Whereas potassium channels typically use glycines as a hinge for gating , iGluRs use the less flexible alanine as a hinge at a similar position to maintain low basal activity allowing for ligand-mediated gating .
