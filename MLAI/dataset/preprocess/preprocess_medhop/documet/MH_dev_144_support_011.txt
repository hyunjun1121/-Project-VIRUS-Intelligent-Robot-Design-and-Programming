Inflammasomes and host defenses against bacterial infections . The inflammasome has emerged as an important molecular protein complex which initiates proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β and pro- Q14116 into mature inflammatory cytokines . In addition , inflammasomes initiate pyroptotic cell death that may be independent of those cytokines . Inflammasomes are central to elicit innate immune responses against many pathogens , and are key components in the induction of host defenses following bacterial infection . Here , we review recent discoveries related to Q9C000 , Q96P20 , Q9NPP4 , P59044 , Q8WX94 , P59046 and O14862 -mediated recognition of bacteria . Mechanisms for inflammasome activation and regulation are now suggested to involve kinases such as P19525 and PKCδ , ligand binding proteins such as the NAIPs , and caspase-11 and caspase-8 in addition to caspase-1 . Future research will determine how specific inflammasome components pair up in optimal responses to specific bacteria .
