Correlation between tumor volume response to radiotherapy and expression of biological markers in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : To determine the factors associated with tumor volume response to radiotherapy ( RT ) in cervical cancer patients , and the relationship between the tumor volume response and alteration of the expression of biological markers during RT . METHODS : Twenty consecutive patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive RT were enrolled . Tumor volumes were calculated by Q9BWK5 examinations performed at the start of RT ( pre-RT ) , at the fourth week of RT ( mid-RT ) , and 1 month after RT completion ( post-RT ) . Two serial punch biopsies were performed at pre- and mid-RT , and immunohistochemical staining was performed for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 and epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . RESULTS : For the pre-RT evaluation , fourteen ( 70 % ) and eleven ( 55 % ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . Among the seven patients whose median percentage residual tumor at mid-RT ( P30518 ) was greater than 0.5 , seven ( 100 % , p=0.0515 ) and five ( 71.4 % , p=0.3742 ) patients showed positive immunoreactivity for P35354 and P00533 , respectively . The logistic regression analysis showed that positive immunoreactivity for both P35354 and P00533 at pre-RT were associated with P30518 ( p=0.0782 ) . For the mid-RT evaluation , eight cases showed an interval increase in the distribution of immunoreactivity for P35354 , and six out of the eight patients had a P30518 greater than 0.5 ( p=0.2222 ) . CONCLUSION : The poor mid-RT tumor response was associated with the coexpression of P35354 and P00533 .
