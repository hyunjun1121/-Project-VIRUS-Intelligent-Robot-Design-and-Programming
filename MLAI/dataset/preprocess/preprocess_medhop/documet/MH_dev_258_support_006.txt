NFκB inhibitors induce cell death in glioblastomas . Identification of novel target pathways in glioblastoma ( GBM ) remains critical due to poor prognosis , inefficient therapies and recurrence associated with these tumors . In this work , we evaluated the role of nuclear-factor-kappa-B ( NFκB ) in the growth of GBM cells , and the potential of NFκB inhibitors as antiglioma agents . NFκB pathway was found overstimulated in GBM cell lines and in tumor specimens compared to normal astrocytes and healthy brain tissues , respectively . Treatment of a panel of established GBM cell lines ( U138MG , U87 , U373 and P13671 ) with pharmacological NFκB inhibitors ( BAY117082 , parthenolide , MG132 , curcumin and arsenic trioxide ) and NFκB-p65 siRNA markedly decreased the viability of GBMs as compared to inhibitors of other signaling pathways such as MAPKs ( P29323 , JNK and p38 ) , PKC , P00533 and PI3K/Akt . In addition , NFκB inhibitors presented a low toxicity to normal astrocytes , indicating selectivity to cancerous cells . In GBMs , mitochondrial dysfunction ( membrane depolarization , bcl-xL downregulation and cytochrome c release ) and arrest in the G2/M phase were observed at the early steps of NFκB inhibitors treatment . These events preceded sub- P55008 detection , apoptotic body formation and caspase-3 activation . Also , NFκB was found overstimulated in cisplatin-resistant P13671 cells , and treatment of GBMs with NFκB inhibitors overcame cisplatin resistance besides potentiating the effects of the chemotherapeutics , cisplatin and doxorubicin . These findings support NFκB as a potential target to cell death induction in GBMs , and that the NFκB inhibitors may be considered for in vivo testing on animal models and possibly on GBM therapy .
