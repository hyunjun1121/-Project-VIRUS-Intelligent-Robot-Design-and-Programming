In vivo treatments with fulvestrant and anastrozole differentially affect gene expression in the rat efferent ductules . Estrogen plays a key role in maintaining the morphology and function of the efferent ductules . We previously demonstrated that the antiestrogen fulvestrant markedly affected gene expression in the rat efferent ductules . The mechanism of fulvestrant action to modulate gene expression may involve not only the blockade of P03372 and Q92731 estrogen receptors , but also the activation of P03372 and Q92731 when the receptors are tethered to AP-1 or SP1 transcription factors , or the activation of the Q99527 . We therefore compared the effects of two strategies to interfere with estrogen action in the rat efferent ductules : treatment with fulvestrant or with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole . Whereas fulvestrant markedly increased Mmp7 and Q9BX95 , and reduced Nptx1 mRNA levels , no changes were observed with anastrozole . DB00947 caused changes in epithelial morphology that were not seen with anastrozole . DB00947 shifted P09237 immunolocalization in the epithelial cells from the supranuclear to the apical region ; this effect was less pronounced with anastrozole . In vitro studies of (35)S-methionine incorporation showed that protein release was increased , whereas tissue protein content in the efferent ductules of fulvestrant-treated rats was decreased . Although fulvestrant markedly affected gene expression , no changes were observed on AP-1 and SP1 DNA-binding activity . The blockade of ESRs seems to be the major reason explaining the differences between both treatments . At least some of the effects of fulvestrant appear to result from compensatory mechanisms activated by the dramatic changes caused by P03372 blockade .
