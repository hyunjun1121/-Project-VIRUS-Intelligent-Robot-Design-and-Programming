Hippocampal injury and alterations in neuronal chemokine co-receptor expression in patients with AIDS . Hippocampal neurons express high levels of HIV chemokine co-receptors , activation of which causes injury or death in vitro . To determine if their in vivo expression correlates with injury , we evaluated neuronal P61073 and P51681 immunoreactivity and reactive gliosis in autopsy hippocampus of 10 control cases , 11 AIDS cases without HIV encephalitis ( HIVnE ) or opportunistic infections/lymphomas ( OI/L ) , and 11 AIDS cases with HIV encephalitis ( HIVE ) . All groups had higher P61073 and P51681 expression in P07451 and P22748 neurons than P00915 neurons ( p < 0.05 ) . HIVE cases had increased neuronal P61073 and decreased neuronal P51681 expression as well as increased numbers of hippocampal P14136 -positive astrocytes and LN3-positive microglia . Changes were most severe in P07451 and P22748 and lowest in P00915 regions . These findings also were noted in the 4 HIVE cases with neither hippocampal HIVE nor brain OI/L and in the HIVnE groups . This study quantitates the regional distribution of hippocampal neuronal P61073 and P51681 and shows their respective increase and decrease in AIDS . It suggests a relationship between neuronal loss and gliosis with intensity of neuronal chemokine expression and raises the possibility of a selective vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to AIDS-related injury .
