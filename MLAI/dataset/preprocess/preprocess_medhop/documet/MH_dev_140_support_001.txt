Heterogeneous expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase within colorectal tumors : correlation with tumor angiogenesis . BACKGROUND : Recent studies have shown that the cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) pathways are involved in the development of tumor angiogenesis in human cancers . AIMS : To investigate whether a different pattern of P35354 and P35228 expression/activity exists within different areas of colorectal tumors and to analyze the relationship between these two enzymes and tumor angiogenesis . METHODS : Microvessel density ( P53602 ) and P35354 , P35228 , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and P15692 receptor-2 ( P35968 ) protein expression were evaluated at both the invasive front ( IF ) and the tumor center ( TC ) in 46 human colorectal cancer specimens . We also investigated the concentration of DB00917 and NO at the same sites . RESULTS : P35354 and P35228 protein expression and activity were significantly higher within the IF than the TC of the tumor specimens . Similarly , P53602 and P15692 / P35968 expression significantly increased from the TC to the IF . Only P35354 expression was significantly correlated with P53602 and P15692 / P35968 expression at both the TC and the IF . CONCLUSION : Our study shows a heterogeneous expression of P35354 and P35228 in colorectal cancer . The up-regulation of P35354 at the IF parallels an increase in vessel density and P15692 / P35968 expression , thus supporting the hypothesis that the tumor periphery is the most aggressive portion of a colorectal tumor .
