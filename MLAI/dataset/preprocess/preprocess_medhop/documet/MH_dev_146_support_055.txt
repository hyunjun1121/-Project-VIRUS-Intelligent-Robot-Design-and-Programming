P06850 family of peptides regulates intestinal angiogenesis . BACKGROUND & AIMS : The corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) family of peptides modulates intestinal inflammation and the P06850 receptor 2 ( Q13324 ) suppresses postnatal angiogenesis in mice . We investigated the functions of P34998 and Q13324 signaling during intestinal inflammation and angiogenesis . METHODS : The activities of P34998 and Q13324 were disrupted by genetic deletion in mice or with selective antagonists . A combination of in vivo , ex vivo , and in vitro measures of angiogenesis were used to determine their activity . P34998 (-/-) mice and Q13324 (-/-) mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were analyzed in comparison with wild-type littermates ( controls ) . RESULTS : Colitis was significantly reduced in mice in which P34998 activity was disrupted by genetic deletion or with an antagonist , determined by analyses of survival rate , weight loss , histological scores , and cytokine production . Inflammation was exacerbated in mice in which Q13324 activity was inhibited by genetic deletion or with an antagonist , compared with controls . The inflamed intestines of P34998 (-/-) mice had reduced microvascular density and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) -A , whereas the intestines of Q13324 (-/-) mice had increased angiogenesis and P15692 levels . An antagonist of P35968 activity alleviated colitis in Q13324 (-/-) mice . Ex vivo aortic vessel outgrowth was reduced when P34998 was deficient but increased when Q13324 was deficient . The P34998 preferred agonist P06850 stimulated tube formation , proliferation , and migration of cultured intestinal microvascular endothelial cells by phosphorylating Akt , whereas the specific Q13324 agonist Q969E3 had opposite effects . CONCLUSION : P34998 promotes intestinal inflammation , as well as endogenous and inflammatory angiogenesis whereas Q13324 inhibits these activities .
