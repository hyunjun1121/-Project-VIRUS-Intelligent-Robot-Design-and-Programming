Production of paired helical filament , tau-like proteins by PC12 cells : a model of neurofibrillary degeneration . Neuron-like cells derived from a rat pheochromocytoma cell line ( PC12 ) and differentiated with nerve growth factor produce a paired helical filament ( PHF ) -like antigen when they are subjected to heat shock ( Wallace et al. : Mol Brain Res 19:149-155 , 1993 ) . It accumulates in a localized region of the perinuclear cytoplasm and reacts with monoclonal antitau antibodies , which identify epitopes in the N- and C-terminal halves and the microtubule-binding domain of tau protein . The observed profile of immunoreactivity suggests the presence of full-length and C-terminally truncated tau in a region of perinuclear cytoplasm in which no structurally intact PHFs could be demonstrated by conventional transmission electron microscopy . The accumulated tau protein colocalized with antibodies raised against mitochondrial outer membrane proteins and was associated with the presence of numerous mitochondrial profiles that were demonstrated with electron microscopy . Because differentiated PC12 cells pretreated with colcemid or DB01229 prior to heat shock fail to exhibit perinuclear PHF-like immunoreactivity , the reported response to heat shock appears to require an intact system of intracellular microtubules . This PC12 system provides a model in which the metabolic and molecular biological underpinnings of neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer 's disease can be manipulated . The system may eventually be applicable to the development of pharmaceutical agents that interfere with formation and/or degeneration of P10636 in Alzheimer 's disease .
