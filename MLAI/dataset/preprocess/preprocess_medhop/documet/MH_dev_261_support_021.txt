Dependence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-induced neuronal MAPK signaling on epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation . The hypothalamic decapeptide , gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) , utilizes multiple signaling pathways to activate extracellularly regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases ( P27361 /2 ) in normal and immortalized pituitary gonadotrophs and transfected cells expressing the P30968 . In immortalized hypothalamic DB00644 neurons ( GT1-7 cells ) , which also express DB00644 receptors , DB00644 , epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) caused marked phosphorylation of P27361 /2 . This action of DB00644 and PMA , but not that of P01133 , was primarily dependent on activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and the P27361 /2 responses to all three agents were abolished by the selective P01133 receptor kinase inhibitor , AG1478 . Consistent with this , both DB00644 and P01133 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the P01133 receptor . DB00644 and PMA , but not P01133 , caused rapid phosphorylation of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase , Pyk2 , at DB00135 (402) . This was reduced by Ca(2+) chelation and inhibition of PKC , but not by AG1478 . DB00644 stimulation caused translocation of PKC alpha and -epsilon to the cell membrane and enhanced the association of Src with PKC alpha and PKC epsilon , Pyk2 , and the P01133 receptor . The Src inhibitor , Q99463 , the C-terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) , and dominant-negative Pyk2 attenuated P27361 /2 activation by DB00644 and PMA but not by P01133 . These findings indicate that Src and Pyk2 act upstream of the P01133 receptor to mediate its transactivation , which is essential for DB00644 -induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation in hypothalamic DB00644 neurons .
