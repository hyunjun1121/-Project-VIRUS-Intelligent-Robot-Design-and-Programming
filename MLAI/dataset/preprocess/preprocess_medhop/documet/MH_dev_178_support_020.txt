Effect of DB01708 on endocrine functions of adipose tissue , the involvement of Q07869 gamma . DB01708 ( DB01708 ) , an adrenal steroid , is known to decrease body fat . Thus , it may also alter the endocrine functions of adipose tissue . The aim of this study was to determine if administration of DB01708 might influence adiponectin gene expression and secretion from adipose tissue . We demonstrate here the inducing effect of exogenously administered DB01708 on adiponectin gene expression in epididymal WAT and adiponectin levels in serum of rats fed a DB01708 -containing diet ( 0.6 % , w/w ) for 2 weeks , accompanied by a reduction in epididymal adipose tissue mass . A corresponding increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 (gamma) ) mRNA expression suggests that Q07869 (gamma) may be involved in the up-regulation of adiponectin gene expression after DB01708 treatment . The presented observations indicate that the positive effects of DB01708 , which seems to play a protective role against insulin resistance and atherosclerosis , may be in fact indirect and due to up-regulation of adiponectin gene expression and stimulation of adiponectin secretion from adipose tissue .
