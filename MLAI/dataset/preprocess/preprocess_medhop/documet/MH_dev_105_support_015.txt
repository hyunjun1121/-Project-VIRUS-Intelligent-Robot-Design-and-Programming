An update on molecularly targeted therapies in second- and third-line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer : focus on P00533 inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents . DB01248 , pemetrexed and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( gefitinib and erlotinib ) are recommended second-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients with disease progression . Although erlotinib is the only recommended third-line therapy , several drugs are being used in the clinic . Recent studies have focused on combining targeted agents with approved therapies , including broad-spectrum multikinase inhibitors targeting multiple ErbB Family receptors and multitargeted anti-angiogenic agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , platelet-derived growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor pathways . Here , we review targeted therapies that are being evaluated in second- and third-line settings in NSCLC , including the ErbB Family Blocker afatinib ( DB08916 ) , multityrosine kinase inhibitors ( pelitinib [ Q9Y259 -56 ] ) , neratinib [ HKI-272 ] , canertinib [ DB05424 ] , lapatinib [ GW-572016 ] , dacomitinib [ PF-299804 ] ) and multitargeted anti-angiogenic agents ( vandetanib [ DB05294 ] , sunitinib [ SU11248 ] , sorafenib [ BAY43-9006 ] , nintedanib [ BIBF1120 ] , axitinib [ AG-013736 ] , cediranib [ DB04849 ] , motesanib [ Q99217 706 ] , linifanib [ ABT869 ] and pazopanib [ DB06589 ] ) .
