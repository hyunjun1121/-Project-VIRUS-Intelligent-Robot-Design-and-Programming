Telmisartan , its potential therapeutic implications in cardiometabolic disorders . There is a growing body of evidence that the renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases . Indeed , large clinical trials have demonstrated substantial benefit of the blockade of this system for cardiovascular-organ protection . Although several types of angiotensin II type 1 ( AT(1) ) receptor blockers ( ARBs ) are commercially available for the treatment of patients with hypertension , we have recently found that telmisartan ( DB00966 ) could have the strongest binding affinity to AT(1) receptor . Telmisartan will be a promising cardiometabolic sartan due to its unique peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) -inducing properties as well . In this review , we focused on telmisartan , and discussed its potential therapeutic implications in cardiometabolic disorders .
