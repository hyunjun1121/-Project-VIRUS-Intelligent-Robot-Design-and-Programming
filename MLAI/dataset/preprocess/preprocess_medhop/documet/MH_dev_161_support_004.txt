Thrombocytopenia induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor abexinostat involves p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms . Abexinostat is a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) that demonstrates efficacy in malignancy treatment . Like other HDACi , this drug induces a profound thrombocytopenia whose mechanism is only partially understood . We have analyzed its effect at doses reached in patient plasma on in vitro megakaryopoiesis derived from human P28906 (+) cells . When added at day 0 in culture , abexinostat inhibited CFU-MK growth , megakaryocyte ( MK ) proliferation and differentiation . These effects required only a short incubation period . Decreased proliferation was due to induction of apoptosis and was not related to a defect in P07202 / P40238 / O60674 / P35610 signaling . When added later ( day 8 ) , the compound induced a dose-dependent decrease ( up to 10-fold ) in proplatelet ( PPT ) formation . Gene profiling from MK revealed a silencing in the expression of DNA repair genes with a marked Q06609 decrease at protein level . DNA double-strand breaks were increased as attested by elevated Î³ P16104 phosphorylation level . Moreover , Q13315 was phosphorylated leading to p53 stabilization and increased Q07812 and P38936 expression . The use of a p53 shRNA rescued apoptosis , and only partially the defect in PPT formation . These results suggest that HDACi induces a thrombocytopenia by a p53-dependent mechanism along MK differentiation and a p53-dependent and -independent mechanism for PPT formation .
