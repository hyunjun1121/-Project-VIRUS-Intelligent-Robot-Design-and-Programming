Mammalian Q99572 receptor pharmacology : comparison of recombinant mouse , rat and human Q99572 receptors . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Acute activation of Q99572 receptors rapidly opens a non-selective cation channel . Sustained Q99572 receptor activation leads to the formation of cytolytic pores , mediated by downstream recruitment of hemichannels to the cell surface . Species- and single-nucleotide polymorphism-mediated differences in Q99572 receptor activation have been reported that complicate understanding of the physiological role of Q99572 receptors . Studies were conducted to determine pharmacological differences between human , rat and mouse Q99572 receptors . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Receptor-mediated changes in calcium influx and Yo-Pro uptake were compared between recombinant mouse , rat and human Q99572 receptors . For mouse Q99572 receptors , wild-type ( BALB/c ) and a reported loss of function ( C57BL/6 ) Q99572 receptor were also compared . KEY RESULTS : BzATP [ 2,3-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)- DB00171 ] was more potent than DB00171 in stimulating calcium influx and Yo-Pro uptake at rat , human , BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse Q99572 receptors . Two selective Q99572 receptor antagonists , A-740003 and A-438079 , potently blocked Q99572 receptor activation across mammalian species . Several reported P51575 receptor antagonists [ e.g. P59665 2159 ( 4- [ ( 4-formyl-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3- [ (phosphonooxy)methyl } -2-pyridinyl ) azo ] -benzoic acid ) , PPNDS and NF279 ] blocked Q99572 receptors . NF279 fully blocked human Q99572 receptors , but only partially blocked BALB/c Q99572 receptors and was inactive at C57BL/6 Q99572 receptors . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : These data provide new insights into Q99572 receptor antagonist pharmacology across mammalian species . Q99572 receptor pharmacology in a widely used knockout background mouse strain ( C57BL/6 ) was similar to wild-type mouse Q99572 receptors . Several structurally novel , selective and competitive Q99572 receptor antagonists show less species differences compared with earlier non-selective antagonists .
