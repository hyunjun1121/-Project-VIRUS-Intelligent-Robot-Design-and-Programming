Emerging Q9H244 receptor antagonists : role in coronary artery disease . The use of oral antiplatelet therapy in reducing vascular events has been extensively studied . Currently available oral antiplatelet agents include aspirin and the thienopyridine Q9H244 receptor antagonists . These classes are combined frequently in the setting of acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) . Resistance to either or both of these agents is a major concern , as antiplatelet resistance has been linked to an increase in thrombotic events and worse clinical outcomes . As a result , there is a need for newer , more effective antiplatelet agents to address the limitations of currently available therapy . Prasugrel , a third generation thienopyridine , has been approved by both the FDA and European Commission . Two additional Q9H244 agents , ticagrelor and cangrelor are in advanced stages of development . The possible advantages of prasugrel over clopidogrel include a faster onset of action , reduced inter-patient variability and more potent platelet inhibition . DB08816 is an oral reversible Q9H244 antagonist with greater platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel . DB06441 is being developed as an intravenous Q9H244 antagonist with a very fast onset and offset , which may offer advantages particularly in the setting of coronary intervention . These emerging antiplatelet agents may offer advantages such as faster onset of action , greater potency and reversibility of platelet inhibition . This article summarizes the available clinical data on the upcoming Q9H244 antiplatelet agents in the treatment of coronary artery disease .
