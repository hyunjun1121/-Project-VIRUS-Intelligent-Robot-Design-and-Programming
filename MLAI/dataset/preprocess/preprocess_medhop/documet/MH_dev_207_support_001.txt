ABT-737 is highly effective against molecular subgroups of multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that is heterogeneous with respect to its causative molecular abnormalities and the treatment response of patients . The Bcl-2 protein family is critical for myeloma cell survival . ABT-737 is a cell-permeant compound that binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) but not to Mcl-1 . Using a myeloma cell line collection ( n = 25 ) representative of different molecular translocations , we showed that ABT-737 effectively kills a subset of cell lines ( n = 6 ) , with a median lethal dose ranging from 7 ± 0.4 nM to 150 ± 7.5 nM . Of interest , all sensitive cell lines harbored a t(11;14) . We demonstrated that ABT-737-sensitive and ABT-737-resistant cell lines could be differentiated by the P10415 / Q07820 expression ratio . A screen of a public expression database of myeloma patients indicates that the P10415 / Q07820 ratio of t(11;14) and hyperdiploid patients was significantly higher than in all other groups ( P < .001 ) . ABT-737 first induced the disruption of Bcl-2/Bax , Bcl-2/Bik , or Bcl-2/Puma complexes , followed by the disruption of Bcl-2 heterodimers with Bak and Bim . Altogether , the identification of a subset of cell lines and primary cells effectively killed by ABT-737 alone supported the evaluation of DB05764 , an orally active counterpart to ABT-737 , for the treatment of t(11;14) and hyperdiploid groups of myeloma harboring a Bcl-2(high)/Mcl-1(low) profile .
