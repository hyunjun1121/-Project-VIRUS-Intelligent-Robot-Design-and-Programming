Osteoclast size heterogeneity in rat long bones is associated with differences in adhesive ligand specificity . P00734 ( PT ) is an RGD-containing bone-residing precursor to the serine protease thrombin ( TH ) , which acts as an agonist for a variety of cellular responses in osteoblasts and osteoclasts . We show here that PT , TH , osteopontin ( P10451 ) and fibronectin ( FN ) promoted adhesion of isolated neonatal rat long bone osteoclasts . However , the cells that adhered to PT and TH were smaller in size , rounded and contained 3-4 nuclei , in comparison to the cells adhering to P10451 and FN , which were larger with extended cytoplasmic processes and 6-7 nuclei . Attachment of the larger osteoclasts to P10451 and FN was inhibited by antibodies towards beta 3 and beta 1 integrin subunits , respectively . Whereas an RGD-containing peptide inhibited adhesion of the smaller osteoclasts to PT and TH , this was not seen with the beta 3 or beta 1 antibodies . In contrast , the beta 1 antibody augmented osteoclast adhesion to PT and TH in an RGD-dependent manner . Small osteoclasts were less efficient in resorbing mineralized bovine bone slices , as well as expressed lower mRNA levels of P14780 and the cathepsins K and L compared to large osteoclasts . The small osteoclast adhering to PT and TH may represent either an immature , less functional precursor to the large osteoclast or alternatively constitute a distinct osteoclast population with a specific role in bone .
