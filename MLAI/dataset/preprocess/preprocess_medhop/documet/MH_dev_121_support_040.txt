Endothelial dysfunction in congestive heart failure : P12821 inhibition vs. angiotensin II antagonism . BACKGROUND : Endothelial dysfunction of the vasculature contributes to the elevated peripheral resistance and reduced myocardial perfusion in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . The present study systematically investigated the effect of angiotensin II ( AT(1) ) - receptor blockade on vascular superoxide ( O(2)(-) ) production and endothelial dysfunction . METHODS AND RESULTS : Vasodilator responses and O(2)(-) production were determined in aortic rings from Wistar rats with experimental CHF 10 weeks after extensive myocardial infarction and compared with sham-operated animals ( Sham ) . Rats were either treated with placebo ( P ) , with the AT(1)-receptor antagonist Irbesartan ( 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) or with the P12821 inhibitor DB00519 ( 0.3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) . In CHF-P , endothelium-dependent , acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated compared with Sham-P . Chronic treatment with DB00519 or Irbesartan significantly improved endothelium-dependent relaxation . Aortic O(2)(-) formation was markedly increased in CHF , and was not significantly affected by DB00519 treatment , while it was reduced by Irbesartan. P29474 expression was reduced in CHF and normalised by both treatments . CONCLUSION : Endothelial vasomotor function in CHF rats was normalised by long-term treatment with an P12821 inhibitor or an AT(1)-antagonist . Reduced aortic P29474 expression was normalised by both treatments , whereas aortic superoxide formation was only reduced by the AT(1)-antagonist Irbesartan .
