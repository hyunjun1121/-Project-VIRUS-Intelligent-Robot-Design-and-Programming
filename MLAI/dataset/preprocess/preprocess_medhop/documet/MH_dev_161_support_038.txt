Changes in gene expression in atherosclerotic plaques analyzed using DNA array . A better understanding of atherogenesis at the level of gene expression could lead to the identification of new therapeutic strategies for vascular diseases . With DNA array technology , it is possible to identify multiple , simultaneous changes in gene expression in small tissue samples from atherosclerotic arteries . We analyzed gene expression in normal arteries and in immunohistologically characterized human advanced atherosclerotic lesions using an array of 18376 cDNA fragments . The array method was first validated by detecting a group of genes ( n=17 ) that were already known to be connected to atherogenesis . These genes included e.g. P02649 , P34810 , P01033 and phospholipase D . Next we detected 75 differentially expressed genes that were previously not connected to atherogenesis . A subgroup of genes involved in cell signaling and proliferation was selected for further analyzes with in situ hybridization and RT-PCR which confirmed array results by showing induction in advanced lesions of P23458 ( P23458 ) which is an important signaling molecule in activated macrophages ; P15692 receptor-2 which mediates angiogenic and vasculoprotective effects of P15692 ; and an unknown gene , which mapped on chromosome 19 . It is concluded that DNA array technology enables fast screening of gene expression in small samples of atherosclerotic lesions . The technique will be useful for the identification of new factors , such as P23458 and P15692 receptor-2 , which may play an important role in atherogenesis .
