The retinoid anticancer signal : mechanisms of target gene regulation . Retinoids induce growth arrest , differentiation , and cell death in many cancer cell types . One factor determining the sensitivity or resistance to the retinoid anticancer signal is the transcriptional response of retinoid-regulated target genes in cancer cells . We used cDNA microarray to identify 31 retinoid-regulated target genes shared by two retinoid-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines , and then sought to determine the relevance of the target gene responses to the retinoid anticancer signal . The pattern of retinoid responsiveness for six of 13 target genes ( RARbeta2 , O43174 , P09455 , O15492 , Q16828 , P18146 ) correlated with phenotypic retinoid sensitivity , across a panel of retinoid-sensitive or -resistant lung and breast cancer cell lines . Retinoid treatment of P04198 transgenic mice bearing neuroblastoma altered the expression of five of nine target genes examined ( RARbeta2 , O43174 , P09455 , Q16828 , P00750 ) in neuroblastoma tumour tissue in vivo . In retinoid-sensitive neuroblastoma , lung and breast cancer cell lines , direct inhibition of retinoid-induced RARbeta2 expression blocked induction of only one of eight retinoid target genes ( O43174 ) . DNA demethylation , histone acetylation , and exogenous overexpression of RARbeta2 partially restored retinoid-responsive O43174 expression in RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast , but not SK-MES-1 lung , cancer cells . Combined , rather than individual , inhibition of Q16828 and O15492 was required to block retinoid-induced growth inhibition in neuroblastoma cells , through phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase . In conclusion , sensitivity to the retinoid anticancer signal is determined in part by the transcriptional response of key retinoid-regulated target genes , such as RARbeta2 , Q16828 , and O15492 .
