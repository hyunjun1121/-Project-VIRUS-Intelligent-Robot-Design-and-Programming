Targeting ornithine decarboxylase in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis prevents tumor formation . Checkpoints that control Myc-mediated proliferation and apoptosis are bypassed during tumorigenesis . Genes encoding polyamine biosynthetic enzymes are overexpressed in B cells from E mu-Myc transgenic mice . Here , we report that disabling one of these Myc targets , P11926 ( Odc ) , abolishes Myc-induced suppression of the Cdk inhibitors P38936 (Cip1) and p27(Kip1) , thereby impairing Myc 's proliferative , but not apoptotic , response . Moreover , lymphoma development was markedly delayed in E mu-Myc;Odc(+/-) transgenic mice and in E mu-Myc mice treated with the Odc inhibitor difluoromethylornithine ( DB06243 ) . Strikingly , tumors ultimately arising in E mu-Myc;Odc(+/-) transgenics lacked deletions of Arf , suggesting that targeting Odc forces other routes of transformation . Therefore , Odc is a critical Myc transcription target that regulates checkpoints that guard against tumorigenesis and is an effective target for cancer chemoprevention .
