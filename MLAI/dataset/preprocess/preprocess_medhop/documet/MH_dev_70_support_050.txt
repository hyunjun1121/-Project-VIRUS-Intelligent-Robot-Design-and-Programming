Modulation of a Mr 175,000 c-neu receptor isoform in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells by serum starvation . The neu proto-oncogene product has been found to exist in two interconvertible forms in Q9UBA6 / P00374 mouse fibroblasts . The 185-kilodalton form ( p185 ) present in growing cells is replaced by a 175-kilodalton form ( p175 ) under conditions of serum starvation . This low molecular weight form accounts almost exclusively for the phosphotyrosine content of the receptor and is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity . Addition of serum , platelet-derived growth factor or tumor promoter induces conversion of p175 to p185 within minutes , and this increase in molecular weight is associated with phosphorylation of serine and threonine ; removal of serum growth factors is followed by replacement of p185 with p175 over several hours . Unlike Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells , the human breast cancer cell line SK-Br-3 expresses a high molecular weight neu/ P04626 receptor with unchanged phosphotyrosine content in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures . These findings indicate that activation of the neu proto-oncogene product in Q9UBA6 / P00374 cells may be regulated in part by protein kinase C-mediated receptor transmodulation rather than by ligand availability alone .
