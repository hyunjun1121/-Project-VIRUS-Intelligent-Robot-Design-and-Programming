State of the art of new Q9H244 antagonists . The interaction of ADP with its platelet receptor Q9H244 plays a crucial role in platelet activation and thrombogenesis . This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical trials of specific antagonists of Q9H244 . DB00758 is a thienopyridine with proven antithrombotic efficacy , but it has some important drawbacks : ( a ) it is a pro-drug that needs to be metabolized to its active metabolite ; ( b ) it has a delayed onset and offset of action and ( c ) there is high inter-individual variability in pharmacological response . Prasugrel is also a thienopyridine , with faster onset of action and a more uniform inhibition of platelet function compared to clopidogrel , accounting for lower incidence of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( P05154 ) and higher incidence of both non-CABG-related bleeding complications . Two direct and reversible Q9H244 antagonists , DB06441 and ticagrelor , are characterized by rapid onset and reversal of platelet inhibition . DB06441 is not superior to clopidogrel in preventing thrombotic events in patients undergoing P05154 . DB08816 is superior to clopidogrel in preventing major adverse cardiac events in ACS patients , but , like prasugrel , is associated with a higher frequency of non-CABG-related bleeding complications . A shorter period of drug discontinuation before surgery is necessary in ticagrelor-treated patients compared to clopiodgrel-treated patients to limit the severity of post-surgical bleeding .
