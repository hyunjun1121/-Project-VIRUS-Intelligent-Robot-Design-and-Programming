DB02527 inhibition of murine intestinal Na/H exchange requires P13569 -mediated cell shrinkage of villus epithelium . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Unlike the intestine of normal subjects , small-intestinal epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein-null ( P13569 (-) ) mice do not respond to stimulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate with inhibition of electroneutral NaCl absorption . Because P13569 -mediated anion secretion has been associated with changes in crypt cell volume , we hypothesized that P13569 -mediated cell volume reduction in villus epithelium is required for intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate inhibition of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger ( primarily P48764 ) activity in the proximal small intestine . METHODS : Transepithelial (22)Na flux across the jejuna of P13569 (+) , P13569 (-) , the basolateral membrane Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter protein P55011 (+) , and P55011 (-) mice were correlated with changes in epithelial cell volume of the midvillus region . RESULTS : Stimulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulted in cessation of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-mediated Na(+) absorption ( J(ms)(NHE) ) in P13569 (+) jejunum but had no effect on J(ms)(NHE) across P13569 (-) jejunum . Cell volume indices indicated an approximately 30 % volume reduction of villus epithelial cells in P13569 (+) jejunum but no changes in P13569 (-) epithelium after intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulation . In contrast , cell shrinkage induced by hypertonic medium inhibited J(ms)(NHE) in both P13569 (+) and P13569 (-) mice . DB00887 treatment to inhibit Cl(-) secretion by blockade of the Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter , P55011 , of stimulated P13569 (+) jejunum prevented maximal volume reduction of villus epithelium and recovered approximately 40 % of J(ms)(NHE) . Likewise , J(ms)(NHE) and cell volume were unaffected by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulation in P55011 (-) jejuna . CONCLUSIONS : These findings show a previously unrecognized role of functional P13569 expressed in villus epithelium : regulation of P48764 -mediated Na(+) absorption by alteration of epithelial cell volume .
