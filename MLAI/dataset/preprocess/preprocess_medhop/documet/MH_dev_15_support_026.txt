Noncatalytic function of P27361 /2 can promote Raf/MEK/ P29323 -mediated growth arrest signaling . Kinase activity is known as the key biochemical property of MAPKs . Here , we report that P27361 /2 also utilizes its noncatalytic function to mediate certain signal transductions . Sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ P29323 pathway induces growth arrest , accompanied by changes in cell cycle regulators ( decreased retinoblastoma phosphorylation , Q01094 down-regulation , and/or P38936 (CIP1) up-regulation ) and cell type-specific changes in morphology and expression of c-Myc or P07949 in the human tumor lines LNCaP , U251 , and TT . Ablation of P27361 /2 by RNA interference abrogated all these effects . However , active site-disabled P29323 mutants ( P27361 -K71R , P28482 -K52R , and P28482 -D147A ) , which competitively inhibit activation of endogenous P27361 /2 , could not block Raf/MEK-induced growth arrest as well as changes in the cell cycle regulators , although they effectively blocked phosphorylation of the P27361 /2 catalytic activity readouts , p90(RSK) and ELK1 , as well as the cell type-specific changes . Because this indicated a potential noncatalytic P27361 /2 function , we generated stable lines of the tumor cells in which both P27361 and P28482 were significantly knocked down , and we further investigated the possibility using rat-derived kinase-deficient P29323 mutants ( P28482 -K52R and P28482 -T183A/Y185F ) that were not targeted by human small hairpin RNA . Indeed , P28482 -K52R selectively restored Raf-induced growth inhibitory signaling in P27361 /2-depleted cells , as manifested by regained cellular ability to undergo growth arrest and to control the cell cycle regulators without affecting c-Myc and morphology . However , P28482 -T183A/Y185F was less effective , indicating the requirement of TEY site phosphorylation . Our study suggests that functions of P27361 /2 other than its " canonical " kinase activity are also involved in the pathway-mediated growth arrest signaling .
