Prasugrel : a new antiplatelet drug for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease . Prasugrel , trade name DB06209 , is an investigational new antiplatelet drug currently under review for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration . It is a thienopyridine analog with a structure similar to that of clopidogrel and ticlopidine . Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of adenosine diphosphate to the purinergic Q9H244 receptor on the platelet surface . Prasugrel has been shown to be a potent antiplatelet agent with a faster , more consistent , and greater inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel . It is debatable , however , how effectively these pharmacologic benefits will translate to clinical benefits . The results of the large TRITON-TIMI 38 trial , which compared prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were scheduled to receive coronary stents , demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic events , including stent thrombosis , with prasugrel , but with an increased risk of major bleeding . The exact role of prasugrel in the management of ischemic heart disease is still being defined , but the risk:benefit ratio will likely play a major role in directing the best place for therapy with this new agent .
