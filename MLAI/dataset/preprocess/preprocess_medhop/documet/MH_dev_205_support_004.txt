Pharmacological inhibition of p38 Q96HU1 kinase results in improved glucose uptake in insulin-resistant 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . Inhibition of p38 , a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family , has been shown to prevent the loss of P14672 protein expression in insulin-resistant adipocytes without improving insulin receptor substrate 1 ( P35568 ) protein levels and presumably insulin signaling . Thus , it was unclear whether p38 inhibitors would have a beneficial effect upon insulin-stimulated glucose uptake . We evaluated the effects of p38 inhibition during the development of insulin resistance upon glucose uptake and components of the insulin signaling pathway to determine the therapeutic value of p38 inhibitors . Treatment with the specific p38 inhibitor , A304000 , during the development of insulin resistance increased basal glucose uptake as well as glucose uptake in response to a subsequent insulin stimulation . p38 inhibition increased P11166 protein levels and prevented the loss of P14672 . However , p38 inhibition did not prevent the loss of P35568 protein levels or insulin signaling to P31749 in insulin-resistant cells . DB00877 , an inhibitor or P42345 , could partially improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake through maintaining P35568 protein levels . Combined treatment with both A304000 and rapamycin had an additive effect upon glucose uptake . These data indicate that p38 inhibition can enhance glucose uptake through regulating the expression of P11166 and 4 , but did not prevent the development of insulin resistance .
