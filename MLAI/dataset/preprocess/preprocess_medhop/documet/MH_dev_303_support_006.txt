The P05230 -specific single-chain antibody scFv1C9 effectively inhibits breast cancer tumour growth and metastasis . Immunotherapy mediated by recombinant antibodies is an effective therapeutic strategy for a variety of cancers . In a previous study , we demonstrated that the fibroblast growth factor 1 ( P05230 ) -specific recombinant antibody scFv1C9 arrests the cell cycle at the G0/ P55008 transition by blocking the intracrine P05230 pathway in breast cancer cells . Here , we further show that the overexpression of scFv1C9 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by lentiviral infection resulted in decreased tumourigenicity , tumour growth and lung metastasis through P05230 neutralization . We found that scFv1C9 resulted in the up-regulation of P38936 , which in turn inhibited the expression of P24941 and blocked cell cycle progression . To explore the potential role of scFv1C9 in vivo , we delivered the gene into solid tumours by electroporation , which resulted in significant inhibition of tumour growth . In tumour tissue sections , immunohistochemical staining of the cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 and the microvessel marker CD31 showed a reduction in the proliferative index and microvessel density , respectively , upon expression of scFv1C9 compared with the appropriate controls . Thus , our data indicate a central role for scFv1C9 in blocking the intracrine pathway of P05230 , therefore , scFv1C9 could be developed in an effective therapeutic for breast cancer .
