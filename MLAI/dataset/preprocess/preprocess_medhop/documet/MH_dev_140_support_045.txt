Second line therapies for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors eventually acquire resistance to imatinib mesylate . This review focuses on recent progress on management of patients whose disease progresses on the standard dose of imatinib . RECENT FINDINGS : Approximately 30 % of patients failing standard-dose imatinib achieve disease stabilization with high-dose imatinib , but objective responses are few and the clinical benefit usually short-lived . Patients receiving enzyme-inducing drugs may need high imatinib doses to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations . Surgical excision of a single growing metastasis leads to a median progression-free survival time of 7-11 months . DB01268 malate is effective following imatinib failure . The median time to disease progression is approximately 6 months with sunitinib therapy versus 6 weeks with placebo following discontinuation of imatinib , but few ( 5 % ) patients achieve objective response . Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor with P10721 exon 9 mutation may benefit more from sunitinib than those with exon 11 mutation . DB01268 frequently causes abnormal thyroid function . SUMMARY : DB01268 is now the approved second line therapy following imatinib failure and for patients intolerant to imatinib . The clinical benefit is only moderate , and thyroid function monitoring is required . Several investigational agents are being evaluated for imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor . Palliative procedures , such as hepatic arterial embolization , also require study .
