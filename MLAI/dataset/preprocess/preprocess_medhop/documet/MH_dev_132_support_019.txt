Immunohistochemical detection of alpha1E voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel isoforms in cerebellum , P01308 -1 cells , and neuroendocrine cells of the digestive system . Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a common and a specific epitope present only in longer alpha1E isoforms of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels , yielding an " anti-E-com " and an " anti-E-spec " serum , respectively . The specificity of both sera was established by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting using stably transfected P29320 -293 cells or membrane proteins derived from them . Cells from the insulinoma cell line P01308 -1 , tissue sections from cerebellum , and representative regions of gastrointestinal tract were stained immunocytochemically . P01308 -1 cells expressed an alpha1E splice variant with a longer carboxy terminus , the so-called alpha1Ee isoform . Similarily , in rat cerebellum , which was used as a reference system , the anti-E-spec serum stained somata and dendrites of Purkinje cells . Only faint staining was seen throughout the cerebellar granule cell layer . After prolonged incubation times , neurons of the molecular layer were stained by anti-E-com , suggesting that a shorter alpha1E isoform is expressed at a lower protein density . In human gastrointestinal tract , endocrine cells of the antral mucosa ( stomach ) , small and large intestine , and islets of Langerhans were stained by the anti-E-spec serum . In addition , staining by the anti-E-spec serum was observed in Paneth cells and in the smooth muscle cell layer of the lamina muscularis mucosae . We conclude that the longer alpha1Ee isoform is expressed in neuroendocrine cells of the digestive system and that , in pancreas , alpha1Ee expression is restricted to the neuroendocrine part , the islets of Langerhans. alpha1E therefore appears to be a common voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel linked to neuroendocrine and related systems of the body .
