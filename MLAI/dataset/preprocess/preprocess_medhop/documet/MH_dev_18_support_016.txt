Regulation of activating transcription factor-2 in early stage of the adipocyte differentiation program . p38beta mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is required for the differentiation of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 fibroblasts into adipocytes . Activating transcription factor-2 ( P39905 -2 ) is efficiently phosphorylated and activated by p38beta kinase . These findings led us to examine a regulatory role of P39905 -2 in adipocyte differentiation . The induction of P39905 -2 protein precedes the expression of the transcription factors , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) alpha . Consistent with early activation of p38beta kinase , the phosphorylation of P39905 -2 was also detected in early stage of adipocyte differentiation . P39905 -2 regulated gene transcription of PPARgamma , which was synergistically enhanced by p38beta kinase and C/EBPbeta proteins expression . Ectopic expression of P39905 -2 in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells induced the endogenous PPARgamma protein levels . These results suggest that P39905 -2 plays a role in a primary regulator of adipocyte differentiation with C/EBPbeta through promoting adipogenesis-inducing transcription factors including PPARgamma and becomes associated earlier in the differentiation program as mitotic clonal expansion proceeds and the cells become initially differentiated .
