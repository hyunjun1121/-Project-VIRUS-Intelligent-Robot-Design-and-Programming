Beyond the TRIBUTE trial : integrating P00533 / P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC . Evaluation of : Herbst RS , Prager D , Hermann R et al. : TRIBUTE : a Phase III trial of erlotinib hydrochloride ( DB00530 ) combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer . J . Clin . Oncol . 23 , 5892-5899 ( 2005 ) . Patients diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer have limited therapeutic options . A large , randomized , controlled trial of the human epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor , erlotinib ( Tarceva ) , plus standard first-line chemotherapy did not meet its primary end point of improved survival in the overall population , but did reveal a striking survival benefit in a subset of patients who had never smoked . There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of overall benefit , including the use of an unselected patient population , the need for alternatives to concurrent administration , and a postulated pathophysiological interaction between erlotinib and chemotherapy . Ongoing studies investigating alternative schedules and sequences of administration with chemotherapy will help clinicians to determine how agents such as erlotinib can best be combined with standard cytotoxic agents .
