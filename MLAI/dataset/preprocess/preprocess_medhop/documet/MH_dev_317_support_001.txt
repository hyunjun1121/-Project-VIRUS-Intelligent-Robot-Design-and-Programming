DB06663 , a multiple somatostatin receptor subtypes ligand , reduces cell viability in non-functioning pituitary adenomas by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor secretion . Somatostatin ( SRIF ) analogs have been employed in medical therapy of non-functioning pituitary adenomas ( DB04552 ) , with contrasting results . Previous evidence showed that SRIF can exert its antiproliferative effects by reducing vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) secretion and action , and that P15692 expression may be related to pituitary tumor growth . The aim of our study was to clarify the possible effects of a multireceptor SRIF ligand on P15692 secretion and cell proliferation in human DB04552 primary cultures . We assessed the expression of SRIF receptors ( P30872 -5 ) , the in vitro effects on P15692 secretion , and on cell viability of SRIF and of the stable SRIF analog pasireotide ( DB06663 ) , which activates P30872 , 2 , 3 , and 5 . Twenty-five DB04552 were examined by RT-PCR for expression of alpha-subunit , SSTR , P15692 , and P15692 receptors 1 ( P15692 - Q96GN5 ) and 2 ( P15692 -R2 ) . Primary cultures were tested with SRIF and with pasireotide . All DB04552 samples expressed alpha-sub , P15692 and P17948 and 2 , while SSTR expression pattern was highly variable . Two different groups were identified according to P15692 secretion inhibition by SRIF . P15692 secretion and cell viability were reduced by SRIF and pasireotide in the ' responder ' group , but not in the ' non-responder ' group , including DB04552 expressing P35346 . SRIF and pasireotide completely blocked forskolin-induced P15692 secretion . In addition , SRIF and pasireotide completely abrogated the promoting effects of P15692 on DB04552 cell viability . Our data demonstrate that pasireotide can inhibit DB04552 cell viability by inhibiting P15692 secretion , and suggest that the multireceptor-SSTR agonist pasireotide might be useful in medical therapy of selected DB04552 .
