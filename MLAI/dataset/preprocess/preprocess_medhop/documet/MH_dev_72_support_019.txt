P01308 -induced Q86X55 upregulation facilitates hepatocyte proliferation . Previously , we reported that Q86X55 undergoes ubiquitination-dependent degradation in renal podocytes . It was also reported that Q86X55 is necessary for fasting-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis . Based on these reports , we hypothesized that treatment with insulin , a hormone typically present under the ' fed ' condition , would inhibit gluconeogenesis via Q86X55 degradation . HepG2 cells , AML-12 cells , and rat primary hepatocytes were treated with insulin to confirm Q86X55 downregulation . Surprisingly , insulin treatment increased Q86X55 expression in all cell types examined . Furthermore , treatment with insulin increased histone 3 methylation at arginine 17 and 26 in HepG2 cells . To elucidate the role of insulin-induced Q86X55 upregulation , the HA- Q86X55 plasmid was transfected into HepG2 cells . Q86X55 overexpression did not increase the expression of lipogenic proteins generally increased by insulin signaling . Moreover , Q86X55 knockdown did not influence insulin sensitivity . P01308 is known to facilitate hepatic proliferation . Like insulin , Q86X55 overexpression increased P24941 and P11802 expression . In addition , Q86X55 knockdown reduced the number of insulin-induced G2/M phase cells . Moreover , GFP- Q86X55 overexpression increased the number of G2/M phase cells . Based on these results , we concluded that insulin-induced Q86X55 upregulation facilitates hepatocyte proliferation . These observations indicate that Q86X55 plays an important role in liver pathophysiology .
