DB08904 in the treatment of Crohn 's disease . INTRODUCTION : The introduction of antibodies directed against tumour necrosis factor ( anti- P01375 ) has dramatically changed the concept of treating patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Unfortunately , the long-term efficacy of anti- P01375 agents may be hampered by immunogenicity . The availability of more anti- P01375 agents in the therapeutic armamentarium would therefore be of great benefit in patients loosing response to another anti- P01375 . In this review , the authors will focus on the efficacy of certolizumab pegol ( CZP ) . AREAS COVERED : A literature search to January 2013 was performed to identify all trials studying CZP in patients with CD . The authors first focused on the mechanism of action of CZP . Second , they evaluated the efficacy of an induction and maintenance therapy with CZP and the impact of CZP on mucosal healing and fistula closure . Next , they explored the influence of previous anti- P01375 exposure and baseline P02741 levels . Finally , they analysed the safety data on CZP , including the development of antibodies against CZP and the use of CZP during pregnancy . EXPERT OPINION : Based on the provided literature , CZP could be a good alternative in patients with moderate-to-severe CD failing another anti- P01375 agent . More data are required to conclude on its impact on the long-term outcome of CD .
