Change of redox status and modulation by thiol replenishment in retinal photooxidative damage . PURPOSE : Cellular or tissue reduction-oxidation ( redox ) is crucial in various diseases . The present study was conducted to analyze how tissue redox status is affected by photooxidative stress and whether the exogenous thiol antioxidant DB06151 ( Q9C000 ) affects photooxidative stress-induced retinal damage . METHODS : Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either Q9C000 ( 250 mg/kg ) or phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and exposed to white fluorescent light ( 8000 lux ) for 2 hours . Levels of thioredoxin ( TRX ) , glutaredoxin ( P35754 ) , and glutathione ( DB00143 ) , endogenous regulators of redox ; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ( HNE ) -modified protein , a marker of lipid peroxidation ; and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB , a redox-sensitive transcription factor in retinal samples , was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot or enzymatic recycling assay . Light-induced retinal damage estimated by electroretinography and quantitative immunohistochemistry for 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine ( 8OHdG index ) , a marker of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage , was compared in Q9C000 - and PBS-treated mice . RESULTS : Upregulation of TRX and HNE-modified protein , decrease of DB00143 , and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB were noted after light exposure in PBS-treated mice . These changes were suppressed in Q9C000 -treated mice compared with PBS-treated mice . P35754 was not upregulated after light exposure in any mice . The a- and b-wave amplitudes were significantly higher , and the 8OHdG index was significantly lower after light exposure in Q9C000 -treated mice than in PBS-treated mice . CONCLUSIONS : Retinal redox status is altered by intense light and is normalized partially by the effect of Q9C000 on TRX and DB00143 tissue levels . Manipulation of the tissue redox state by exogenous thiol replenishment may be a useful strategy to prevent retinal photooxidative damage .
