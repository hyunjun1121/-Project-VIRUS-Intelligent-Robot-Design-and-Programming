P35367 antagonist cetirizine impairs working memory processing speed , but not episodic memory . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The histaminergic neurotransmitter system is currently under investigation as a target for drug treatment of cognitive deficits in clinical disorders . The therapeutic potential of new drugs may initially be screened using a model of histaminergic dysfunction , for example , as associated with the use of centrally active antihistamines . Of the selective second generation antihistamines , cetirizine has been found to have central nervous system effects . The aim of the present study was to determine whether cetirizine can be used as a tool to model cognitive deficits associated with histaminergic hypofunction . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : The study was conducted according to a three-way , double-blind , cross-over design . Treatments were single oral doses of cetirizine 10 and 20 mg and placebo . Effects on cognition were assessed using tests of word learning , memory scanning , vigilance , divided attention , tracking and visual information processing speed . KEY RESULTS : DB00341 10 mg impaired tracking performance and both doses impaired memory scanning speed . None of the other measures indicated impaired performance . CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS : DB00341 affects information processing speed , but these effects were not sufficient to serve as a model for cognitive deficits in clinical disorders .
