DB11558 inhalation-induced adrenocortical hypertrophy and endocrinological changes in rat . Rats were exposed to toluene ( 1,500 ppm for 4 hr per day ) for 7 days . The body weight of the rats was significantly lower and the weight of the adrenal gland was significantly higher in the toluene inhalation group compared to the controls . Microscopically , there was no obvious change in the medulla , but hypertrophy of the cortex was observed in the toluene inhalation group . And , the size of adrenocortical cells in treated-rats was also significantly enlarged than the control . Immunohistochemical staining did not show a clear difference in localization of aldosterone-positive cells between the control and inhalation groups . Expansion of the corticosterone-positive area consistent with the cortical hypertrophy was recognized in the inhalation group . Enhancement of 72 kD-heat-shock protein ( HSP70 ) -expression in the toluene inhalation group was not observed . Neither stress nor damage to cortical cells due directly to toluene exposure was observed in the cortex . Also , there was no obvious difference in the anti-proliferating cell nucleus antigen ( P12004 ) -immunostaining between control and inhalation groups . Thus , it is suspected that cortical hypertrophy was the result of cell enlargement due to the stimulation of the cortical cells . P06850 ( CRF ) immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) was increased in the inhalation group . Concentration of plasma DB01285 was elevated significantly by toluene exposure . The amounts of mRNA of adrenocortical steroid metabolism gene , cytochrome side-chain cleavage ( P450scc ) , was also increased by toluene inhalation . DB11558 exposure might induce adrenocortical hypertrophy via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland ( Q9Y251 ) axis .
