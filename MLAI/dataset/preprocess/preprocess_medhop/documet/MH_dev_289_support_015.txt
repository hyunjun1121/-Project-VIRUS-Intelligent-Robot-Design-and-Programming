[ DB00072 ( Herceptin ) and breast cancer : mechanisms of resistance ] . The detection of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) in some breast cancer tumors has led to the development of a targeted treatment that is tumor selective , effective at extending life expectancy in the patients with advanced or early breast cancers . DB00072 ( Herceptin ) , a humanized monoclonal antibody to P04626 is indicated for patients whose tumor demonstrates an amplified copy number for the P04626 oncogene and/or overexpresses the P04626 oncoprotein . Despite a high level of efficacy in combination with chemotherapy , trastuzumab as single agent has limited effectiveness ( up to 30 % response rates ) and patients who respond to trastuzumab will relapse despite continued treatment . The mechanism of trastuzumab action is not fully understood but has been related to cell cycle inhibition . As to mechanisms of resistance , little is known but many preclinical data raised different hypothesis . Thus , the co-expression of growth factor receptors ( P00533 family , DB01277 R ) , and the activation of PI3K-Akt pathway , mainly by loss of P60484 function may be responsible for the resistance phenotype . It would be interesting to identify the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance in breast tumors in order to reverse or prevent it . The characterization of these mechanisms would also provide novel strategies for alternative treatments .
