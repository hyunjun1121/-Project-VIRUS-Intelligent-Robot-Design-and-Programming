Celecoxib and radiation therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer . Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) is frequently present in lung cancer and may play a significant role in carcinogenesis , invasion , and metastasis . It has been associated with shortened survival in patients with resected early-stage adenocarcinoma of the lung . P35354 inhibition decreases tumor cell proliferation in vivo and has been shown to enhance tumor radiosensitivity . Additionally , P35354 inhibition may protect normal pulmonary tissue from radiation fibrosis . Clinical studies are under way to assess the potential benefits and risks of P35354 inhibition in the treatment of lung cancer . The rationale for P35354 inhibitors in the treatment of lung cancer will be reviewed . The results of a phase II study assessing the acute toxicity of concurrent celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and thoracic irradiation in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) are reported , and an ongoing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study using celecoxib and concurrent radiation therapy for NSCLC in patients with intermediate prognostic factors is reviewed .
