CREB inhibits AP-2alpha expression to regulate the malignant phenotype of melanoma . BACKGROUND : The loss of AP-2alpha and increased activity of DB02527 -responsive element binding ( CREB ) protein are two hallmarks of malignant progression of cutaneous melanoma . However , the molecular mechanism responsible for the loss of AP-2alpha during melanoma progression remains unknown . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Herein , we demonstrate that both inhibition of PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation , as well as silencing of CREB expression by shRNA , restored AP-2alpha protein expression in two metastatic melanoma cell lines . Moreover , rescue of CREB expression in CREB-silenced cell lines downregulates expression of AP-2alpha . Loss of AP-2alpha expression in metastatic melanoma occurs via a dual mechanism involving binding of CREB to the AP-2alpha promoter and CREB-induced overexpression of another oncogenic transcription factor , Q01094 . Upregulation of AP-2alpha expression following CREB silencing increases endogenous P38936 (Waf1) and decreases P43121 / P43121 , both known to be downstream target genes of AP-2alpha involved in melanoma progression . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Since AP-2alpha regulates several genes associated with the metastatic potential of melanoma including c- P10721 , P15692 , P25116 , P43121 / P43121 , and P38936 (Waf1) , our data identified CREB as a major regulator of the malignant melanoma phenotype .
