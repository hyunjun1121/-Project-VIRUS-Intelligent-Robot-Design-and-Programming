Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the Japanese population in six candidate genes for long QT syndrome . We report here 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , including 15 novel ones , in six genes that are considered to be candidates for long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) : 2 SNPs in Q14721 , 3 in Q9UK17 , 3 in Q14654 , 7 in O60706 , 3 in P08588 , and 2 in Q05940 . We also examined their allelic frequencies in a Japanese sample population of LQTS-affected and nonaffected individuals . These data will be useful for genetic association studies designed to investigate acquired arrhythmias .
