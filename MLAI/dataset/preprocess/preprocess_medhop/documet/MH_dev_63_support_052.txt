Diet induced regulation of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in rat liver parenchymal and Kupffer cells . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Feeding rodents atherogenic diets enriched in cholesterol or cholic acid changes hepatic cholesterol metabolism . In the present study , the effect of an atherogenic diet enriched in cholesterol and cholic acid on cellular hepatic cholesterol metabolism was studied . METHODS : Gene and protein expression analysis was performed on parenchymal , endothelial , and Kupffer cells isolated from rats fed a chow or atherogenic diet using quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting , respectively . RESULTS : The atherogenic diet raised the serum cholesterol concentration 11-fold , mostly in the VLDL fraction , and led to heavy lipid loading of rat liver parenchymal and Kupffer cells . Only moderate changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were observed in parenchymal cells on the diet , while Q07869 delta expression was 6.8-fold decreased . Kupffer cells , however , showed a highly adaptive response with a 2- to 9-fold induction of Q8WTV0 , O95477 , and Q9H222 / Q9UBA6 , and an 82-fold induction in P22680 mRNA expression , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : Heavy lipid loading of parenchymal cells leads to moderate gene expression changes , while Kupffer cells respond in a highly adaptive fashion by stimulating the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport .
