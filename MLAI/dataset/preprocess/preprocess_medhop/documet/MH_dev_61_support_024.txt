Endotoxin-induced liver damage in rats is minimized by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation . OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN : To investigate the effects of beta(2)-adrenoceptor ( beta(2)-AR ) stimulation on endotoxin-induced liver damage and systemic cytokine levels in rats . SUBJECTS : Standard male Wistar rats . TREATMENT : A disease-model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced acute systemic inflammation was used . The beta(2)-selective AR agonist clenbuterol was administered before , during , and after LPS-challenge to investigate its effects on the acute inflammatory response and associated liver-failure . METHODS : The following parameters have been measured in plasma : P01375 alpha , P01584 , P05231 , P22301 , Q9NRA2 , ALT , and Bilirubin . Liver histological examination was performed to look for changes in tissue morphology . RESULTS : Administration of clenbuterol ( p.o. ) one hour before , or intravenous at the same time as LPS-challenge resulted in a marked reduction of plasma levels of P01375 alpha , P01584 , and P05231 . A change both in plasma-level and in time-concentration profile of the anti-inflammatory cytokine P22301 was found . DB01407 minimized LPS-induced liver damage , as represented by significantly lowered concentrations of several parameters for liver-failure ( Q9NRA2 , ALT , Bilirubin ) , and improved hepatic tissue morphology . DB01407 administration after LPS challenge failed to inhibit P01375 alpha-release but reduced liver-damage . Simultaneous use of the beta(2)-AR antagonist propranolol augmented LPS-induced liver failure , suggesting a role of endogenous adrenoceptor-agonists in prevention of organ-failure during systemic inflammation . CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate that a selective beta(2)-AR agonist might be used as an additional therapeutic agent in the clinic for the treatment of ( acute ) systemic inflammatory disorders in order to reduce or prevent subsequent liver failure .
