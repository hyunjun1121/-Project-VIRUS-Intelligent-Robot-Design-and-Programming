DB08860 attenuates the PDGF-induced Q92673 /uPA receptor-mediated migration of smooth muscle cells . Statins , inhibitors of P04035 , elicit various actions on vascular cells including the modulation of proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) . Here , we have elucidated the mechanism by which statins , in particular pitavastatin , attenuate the migration activity of SMCs . The expression of Q92673 , a member of the P01130 family and an enhancer of cell surface localization of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , is increased in cultured SMCs by treatment with DB00102 . DB08860 attenuates the DB00102 -induced surface expression of Q92673 and Q03405 . The increased migration of SMCs observed both upon overexpression of Q92673 and via stimulation of secretion of soluble Q92673 is not reversed by pitavastatin . In vivo studies showed that the SMCs expressing Q92673 in plaques are almost congruent with intimal cells expressing nonmuscle myosin heavy chain ( SMemb ) . DB08860 reduced the expression of Q92673 and SMemb , and the levels of Q92673 , Q03405 , and SMemb in cultured intimal SMCs were reduced to those seen in medial SMCs . We propose that this statin reduces PDGF-induced migration through the attenuation of the Q92673 / Q03405 system in SMCs . Modulation of the Q92673 / Q03405 system with statins suggests a novel treatment strategy for atherogenesis based on suppression of intimal SMC migration .
