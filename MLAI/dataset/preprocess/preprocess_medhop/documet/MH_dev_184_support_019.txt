P15121 regulates high glucose-induced ectodomain shedding of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha via protein kinase C-delta and P01375 converting enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells . Chronic low-grade inflammation has emerged as a key contributor to the cardiovascular complications of diabetes , however , the mechanisms by which diabetes increases inflammation remain poorly understood . Here , we report that exposure to high glucose ( HG ) stimulates ectodomain shedding of P01375 from rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture . Our results show that exposure to HG decreases membrane-associated P01375 . This decrease in unprocessed P01375 was prevented by the aldose reductase ( AR ) inhibitor sorbinil and AR small interference RNA . Treatment with HG , but not equimolar mannitol or 3-O-methyl glucose , resulted in phosphorylation and activation of P01375 converting enzyme ( P78536 ) ( P78536 ) , which were attenuated by sorbinil or AR-specific small interference RNA . HG-induced P78536 phosphorylation and P01375 processing were also prevented by P01375 protease inhibitor-1 , an inhibitor of P78536 . Inhibition of protein kinase C ( PKC ) -delta by rottlerin prevented HG-induced P78536 activation and the accumulation of unprocessed P01375 . Treatment with sorbinil decreased elevated levels of circulating P01375 in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats . DB02712 treatment also decreased the expression of P01375 , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , matrix metalloproteinase-9 , and increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 in vascular smooth muscle cells treated with HG and in balloon-injured carotid arteries of diabetic rats . These results indicate that HG-induced P01375 shedding could be attributed to P78536 activation , which is regulated , in part , by PKC-delta and AR . Therefore , inhibition of P78536 by P01375 protease inhibitor-1 , or pharmacological inhibition of PKC-delta or AR may represent useful strategies for treating vascular inflammation associated with diabetes .
