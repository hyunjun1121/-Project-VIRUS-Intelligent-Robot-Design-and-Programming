P01160 -induced decrease of iron regulatory protein activity is independent of P09601 induction . Atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) -preconditioned livers are protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury . P01160 -treated organs show increased expression of heme oxygenase ( HO ) -1 . Because P09601 liberates bound iron , the aim of our study was to determine whether P01160 affects iron regulatory protein ( P09544 ) activity and , thus , the levels of ferritin . Rat livers were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer [ +/- P01160 , 8-bromo-cGMP ( 8-Br-cGMP ) , and tin protoporphyrin , 20 min ] , stored in University of Wisconsin solution ( 4 degrees C , 24 h ) , and reperfused ( 120 min ) . P09544 activity was assessed by gel-shift assays , and ferritin , P09544 phosphorylation , and PKC localization were assessed by Western blot . Control livers displayed decreased P09544 activity at the end of ischemia but no change in ferritin content during ischemia and reperfusion . P01160 -pretreated livers showed reduced P09544 activity , an effect mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP . Ferritin levels were increased in P01160 -pretreated organs . Simultaneous perfusion of livers with P01160 and tin protoporphyrin did not reduce P01160 -induced action , arguing against a role for P09601 in changes in P09544 activity . P01160 and 8-Br-cGMP decreased membrane localization of P17252 and PKC-epsilon , but this modulation of PKC seems unrelated to inhibition of P09544 binding . This work shows the cGMP-mediated attenuation of P09544 binding activity by P01160 , which results in increased hepatic ferritin levels . This change in IRPs is independent of P01160 -induced P09601 and reduced PKC activation .
