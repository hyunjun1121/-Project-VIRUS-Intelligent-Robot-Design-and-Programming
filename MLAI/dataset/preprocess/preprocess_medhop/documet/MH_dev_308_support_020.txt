A novel spliced variant of the type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor with a deletion in the seventh transmembrane domain present in the human pregnant term myometrium and fetal membranes . P06850 exerts its actions via activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors , which exist in two types , P34998 and Q13324 , and arise from different genes with multiple spliced variants . RT-PCR amplification of P06850 receptor sequences from human myometrium and fetal membranes yielded cDNAs that encode a novel P06850 -R type 1 spliced variant . This variant ( P06850 -R1d ) is present in the human pregnant myometrium at term only , which suggests a physiologically important role at the end of human pregnancy and labor . The amino acid sequence of P06850 -R1d is identical to the P06850 -R1alpha receptor except that it contains an exon deletion resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain . Binding studies in P29320 -293 cells stably expressing the P06850 -R1d or P06850 -R1alpha receptors revealed that the deletion does not change the binding characteristics of the variant receptor . In contrast , studies on the G protein activation demonstrated that P06850 -R1d is not well coupled to the four subtypes of G proteins ( G(s) , G(i) , G(o) , G(q) ) that P06850 -R1alpha can activate . These data suggest that although the deleted segment is not important for P06850 binding , it plays a crucial role in P06850 receptor signal transduction . Second messenger studies of the variant receptor showed that P06850 and P06850 -like peptides can stimulate the adenylate cyclase system , with reduced sensitivity and potency by 10-fold compared with the P06850 -R1alpha . Furthermore , P06850 failed to stimulate inositol trisphosphate production . Coexpression studies between the P06850 -R1d or P06850 -R1alpha showed that this receptor does not play a role as a dominant negative receptor for P06850 .
