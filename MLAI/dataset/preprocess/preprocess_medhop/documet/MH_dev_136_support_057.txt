DB00398 plus all-trans retinoic acid for AML patients with P36888 -ITD and P06748 mutations . Knowledge of the molecular basis of acute myeloid leukaemia has increased considerably in the past few years , and therapies targeting specific molecular defects of this disease are intensively investigated . Patients with both P06748 and P36888 -ITD mutations encompass 20 % of cytogenetically normal AML . The multikinase and P36888 inhibitor , sorafenib , has shown some efficacy in patients with relapsed P36888 -ITD(+) AML . In addition , it is suggested that all-trans retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) used in combination with chemotherapy has shown to improve outcome of patients harbouring P06748 mutations . We report here the clinical course of three patients with refractory or relapsed P36888 -ITD(+) / P06748 (+) AML who achieved significant response upon sorafenib and DB00755 combination .
