In vitro effects and in vivo efficacy of a novel cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in cats with lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia . OBJECTIVE : To determine cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 selectivity , pharmacokinetic properties , and in vivo efficacy of firocoxib ( Q9NTI2 ,785,713 ) in cats . ANIMALS : 5 healthy male and 14 healthy female domestic shorthair cats . PROCEDURE : Selectivity of firocoxib for inhibiting P35354 was determined by comparing the potency for inhibiting P23219 with that of P35354 in feline blood . Pharmacokinetic properties were determined after i.v. ( 2 mg/kg ) and oral ( 3 mg/kg ) administration in male cats . In vivo efficacy was evaluated in female cats with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced pyrexia with administration of firocoxib 1 or 14 hours before LPS challenge . RESULTS : Blood concentrations resulting in 50 % inhibition of P23219 and P35354 activity in vitro were 75 +/- 2 microM and 0.13 +/- 0.03 microM , respectively , and selectivity for inhibiting P35354 relative to P23219 was 58 . DB09217 had moderate to high oral bioavailability ( 54 % to 70 % ) , low plasma clearance ( 4.7 to 5.8 mL/min/kg ) , and an elimination half-life of 8.7 to 12.2 hours . DB09217 at doses from 0.75 to 3 mg/kg was efficacious in attenuating fever when administered to cats 1 or 14 hours before LPS challenge . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE : DB09217 is a potent P35354 inhibitor and is the only selective P35354 inhibitor described for use in cats to date . It is effective in attenuating febrile responses in cats when administered 14 hours before LPS challenge , suggesting it would be suitable for once-a-day dosing . Because selective P35354 inhibitors have an improved therapeutic index relative to nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in humans , firocoxib has the potential to be a safe , effective anti-inflammatory agent for cats .
