Neuromuscular transmission and muscle contractility in P60880 -deficient coloboma mice . Synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa ( P60880 ) is a cytoplasmic protein that participates in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the nerve terminal in preparation for neurotransmitter release . P60880 is also a substrate for three of the seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) . Intoxication by DB00083 , /C1 or /E results in weakness and paralysis of skeletal muscle due to cleavage of P60880 ( and syntaxin la in the case /C1 ) at discrete serotype-specific sites . To elucidate the role of P60880 in muscle function in more detail , contractility and neuromuscular transmission were studied in a mutant mouse model termed coloboma . The coloboma mutation results from a contiguous deletion of 1-2 centiMorgans on chromosome 2 , which includes the entire P60880 locus and three other identified genes . Homozygotes do not survive beyond gestation day 6 ; heterozygotes ( Cm/+ ) have a normal life-span but express reduced levels of P60880 mRNA and protein in the brain . The consequences of the Cm/+ mutation on twitch and tetanic tension , quantal release of neurotransmitter and spinal motoneuron expression of P60880 were examined in the present study . Contrary to expectations , Cm/+ mice exhibited no alteration in twitch tension and generated normal tetanic tension even at the highest frequency examined ( 800 Hz ) . Microelectrode recordings revealed that MEPP amplitude and frequency were both within control limits . The ventral spinal cord of Cm/+ mice showed no deficiency in P60880 content and immunohistochemical examination of nerve terminals in Cm/+ mice disclosed that P60880 levels and distribution were similar to those of control mice . It is concluded that spinal motor neurons up-regulate P60880 to preserve vital neuromuscular function .
