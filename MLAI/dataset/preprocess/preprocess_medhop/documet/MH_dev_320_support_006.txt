P09917 pathway promotes cell proliferation in human glioma cell lines . OBJECTIVE : P09917 ( P09917 ) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of leukotrienes ( LTs ) , that might promote carcinogenesis . We investigated P09917 expression and examined whether the P09917 pathway is associated with the proliferation of human brain tumors . METHODS : We immunohistochemically evaluated the profile of P09917 expression in various types of brain tumors obtained from 42 patients , and examined the proliferative effects of the P09917 pathway in human glioma cell lines using a proliferation assay . RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry of glioblastomas , astrocytomas , meningiomas , medulloblastomas , craniopharyngiomas , ependymomas , neurinomas , oligodendrogliomas , malignant lymphomas , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial and metastatic brain tumors revealed P09917 expression in the cytoplasm and nuclei or nuclear envelopes of tumor cells . The P09917 inhibitor A861 and the P09960 hydrolase inhibitor DB03424 dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of A172 cells , a glioma cell line . CONCLUSIONS : We confirmed the expression of P09917 in various human brain tumors and demonstrated the partial suppression of tumor growth by inhibitors of the P09917 - P09960 hydrolase pathway in human glioma cell lines . The P09917 - P09960 pathway might play roles in the proliferation of human glioma cells .
