AP-1 transrepressing retinoic acid does not deplete coactivators or AP-1 monomers but may target specific Jun or Fos containing dimers . Retinoic acid ( RA ) inhibits tumor promotion in many models in vivo and in vitro , among them mouse epidermal JB6 cells . RA treatment suppresses 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) induced AP-1 activity , an activity that is required for transformation of JB6 P+ cells . The molecular mechanism of AP-1 transrepression by retinoids is unclear , especially as related to inhibition of transformation . Overexpression of AP-1 components did not rescue TPA induced AP-1 activation nor did a Q86UG4 pull down experiment implicate direct binding , thus rendering unlikely both a Jun/Fos-RA-RAR direct interaction and a Jun/Fos sequestration mechanism . Overexpression of p300 , Q15788 or pCAF did not abrogate AP-1 suppression by RA , thus arguing against coactivator competition . Overexpression of the corepressor silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors ( Q9Y618 ) suppressed AP-1 activity . However , Q9Y618 but not RA inhibited cJun transactivation , suggesting Q9Y618 does not mediate RA transrepression . RA treatment also did not block TPA induced P29323 phosphorylation , Jun/Fos family protein expression except for cFos , or DNA binding of the AP-1 complex . The transcriptional activities of full-length JunB and full-length Fra-1 , but not the transactivation domain fusions , were increased by TPA treatment and suppressed by RA . Since these full-length fusions have bzip domains , the results suggest that JunB and/or Fra-1-containing dimers may constitute one target of RA for transrepression of AP-1 .
