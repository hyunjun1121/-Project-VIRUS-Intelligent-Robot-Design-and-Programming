The diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia due to an islet-cell tumor obscured by a highly specific insulin assay . The work-up of fasting hypoglycemia may be difficult but is crucially important because a wrong diagnosis can lead to either unnecessary pancreatectomy or a missed pancreatic tumor . We describe a patient with severe fasting hypoglycemia [ 22-32 mg/dl ( 1. P35326 .8 mmol/liter ) after 6-10 h of fasting ] in which the diagnosis of a secretory islet-cell tumor was obscured , rather than facilitated , by use of a new , highly specific serum insulin assay . P01308 measured by the specific assay suppressed normally during fasting hypoglycemia [ undetectable at < 2.0-3.8 micro IU/ml ( 26.4 pmol/liter ) ] , whereas insulin measured by older , less specific assays was diagnostically elevated [ 34 , 73 micro IU/ml ( 236.1 , 507.0 pmol/liter ) ] . Serum proinsulin and C-peptide levels were abnormal , and further work-up revealed an islet-cell tumor that secreted predominantly proinsulin . The tumor was surgically removed , relieving the fasting hypoglycemia . We conclude that insulin levels as measured by new , highly specific insulin assays may obscure the diagnosis of a functional , proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor . Because proinsulin cross-reacts with insulin in older insulin assays , C-peptide or proinsulin should be measured to rule out a proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor . Normative values for new insulin assays must be established during prolonged fasting .
