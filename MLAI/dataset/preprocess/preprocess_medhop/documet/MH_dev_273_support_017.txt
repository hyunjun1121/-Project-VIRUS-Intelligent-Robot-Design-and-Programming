P55008 arrest and down-regulation of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine are dependent on the retinoblastoma protein in the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 . The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine has been shown to induce P55008 phase arrest in normal cells but not in most transformed cells . DB02010 did not induce P55008 phase arrest in the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 that lacks a functional retinoblastoma protein ( pRB- ) . However , when infected with a pRB-expressing retrovirus [ Goodrich , D. W. , Chen , Y. , Scully , P. & Lee , W.-H. ( 1992 ) Cancer Res. 52 , 1968-1973 ] , these cells , now pRB+ , were arrested by staurosporine in P55008 phase . This arrest was accompanied by the accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRB . In both the pRB+ and pRB- cells , cyclin D1-associated kinase activities were reduced on staurosporine treatment . In contrast , cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 2 and cyclin E/ P24941 activities were inhibited only in pRB+ cells . DB02010 treatment did not cause reductions in the protein levels of P11802 , cyclin D1 , P24941 , or cyclin E . The CDK inhibitor proteins P38936 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27 ( Kip1 ) levels increased in staurosporine-treated cells . Immunoprecipitation of P24941 , cyclin E , and p2l from staurosporine-treated pRB+ cells revealed a 2.5- to 3-fold higher ratio of p2l bound to P24941 compared with staurosporine-treated pRB- cells . In pRB+ cells , p2l was preferentially associated with Thrl6O phosphorylated active P24941 . In pRB- cells , however , p2l was bound preferentially to the unphosphorylated , inactive form of P24941 even though the phosphorylated form was abundant . This is the first evidence suggesting that P55008 arrest by 4 nM staurosporine is dependent on a functional pRB protein . Cell cycle arrest at the pRB- dependent checkpoint may prevent activation of cyclin E/ P24941 by stabilizing its interaction with inhibitor proteins p2l and p27 .
