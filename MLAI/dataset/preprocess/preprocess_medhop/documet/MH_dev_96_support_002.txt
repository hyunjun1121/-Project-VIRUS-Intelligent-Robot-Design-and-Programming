Suppression of androgen receptor-mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA-binding polyamide . P10275 ( AR ) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease . A DNA-binding polyamide that targets the consensus androgen response element binds the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) promoter androgen response element , inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells , and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer . Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic antiandrogen bicalutamide ( DB01128 ) at the same concentration . Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide . Direct inhibition of the AR-DNA interface by sequence-specific DNA binding small molecules could offer an alternative approach to antagonizing AR activity .
