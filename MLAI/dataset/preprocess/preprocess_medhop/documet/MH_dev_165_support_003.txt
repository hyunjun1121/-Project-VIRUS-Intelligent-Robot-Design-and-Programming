New anti-angiogenic targeted therapy in advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) : current status and future prospects . OBJECTIVES : To address the rationale for anti-angiogenic targeted therapies in advanced RCC . METHODS : We reviewed the international recent literature , using Pubmed search . RESULTS : RCC is genetically linked to factors regulating angiogenesis , in particular vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . DB01268 is a multitarget receptor tyrosine-kinase ( TK ) inhibitor , acting on P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( P09619 ) . DB00398 is an oral multikinase inhibitor ( VEGFR and P09619 ) showing also inhibitors effect on the Raf system . Phase I trials showed no life threatening toxicities relates to these agents . Phase II and phase III trials showed that these antiangiogenic agents are effective in the treatment of advanced RCC , mainly in cytokine refractory metastatic RCC . Survival benefits exist in particular when advanced RCC patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomies before the initiation of the systemic therapy . To better use this kind of targeted therapy in advanced RCC , different points must be developed : the identification of clinical characteristic of RCC able to predict outcomes and responses to therapy ; differences among different compounds ; advantages of combination or sequential therapies . CONCLUSIONS : Targeted therapy with DB01268 and DB00398 has been approved to FDA and is revolutioning how we clinically approach advanced RCC .
