DB00624 modulation of dendritic spines of somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons . Brain structures and functions are increasingly recognized to be directly affected by gonadal hormones , which classically determine reproductive functions and sexual phenotypes . In this regard , we found recently that ovariectomy trimmed the dendritic spines of female rat primary somatosensory cortical neurons and estradiol supplement reversed it . Here , we investigated whether in the male androgen also has a cortical modulatory effect . The dendritic arbors and spines of rat somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons were studied following intracellular dye injection and three-dimensional reconstruction . Dendritic spines , but not length , of the layers III and V pyramidal neurons were found reduced at 2 weeks and rebounded slightly at 4 weeks and further at 8 and 24 weeks following castration , which , however , remained significantly fewer than those of the intact animals . Two weeks of osmotic pump-delivered testosterone treatment to animals castrated for 4 weeks replenished serum testosterone and reversed the densities of dendritic spines on these neurons to control animal levels . P10275 appears to mediate this effect as its antagonist flutamide reduced the dendritic spines of normal adult rats while causing a mild feedback surge of serum testosterone . On the other hand , blocking the conversion of testosterone to estrogen with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole failed to alter the dendritic spine densities in male adult rats . In conclusion , these results support our hypothesis that testosterone acts directly on the androgen receptor in males to modulate the dendritic spines of somatosensory cortical output neurons .
