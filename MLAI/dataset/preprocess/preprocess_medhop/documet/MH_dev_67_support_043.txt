Genetic structure of candidate genes for litter size in Italian Large White pigs . The aim of this work was to verify whether polymorphisms in candidate genes for litter size segregate in Italian Large White ( ITLW ) pigs . We genotyped 120 sows that belonged to six different farms for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of 10 different genes . Polymorphisms in the chosen genes had already been associated with litter-size traits in other pig populations and were candidates for function and/or chromosomal location . The results indicated that the O14967 , pDAZL , and RFN4 SNPs were not segregating in the genotyped samples . The remaining seven markers were polymorphic with minor allele frequencies ranging from 0.10 ( AFP ) to 0.48 ( P02753 ) . Because of the observed genetic variabilities in the investigated loci , the polymorphisms in the AFP , O00238 , P02778 , Q92731 , P30968 , Q9Y2E5 , and P02753 genes can be considered suitable markers for association studies with litter-size traits in ITLW pigs .
