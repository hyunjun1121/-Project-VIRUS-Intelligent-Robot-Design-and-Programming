Human prostacyclin receptor . DB01240 , a member of the eicosanoid family of lipid mediators , is the major product of arachidonic acid metabolism formed in the marcovascular endothelium . It is a potent vasodilator , antithrombotic , and antiplatelet agent that mediates it effects through a membrane-associated receptor termed the IP . Cloning of the cDNA for IP , from human and other species , indicated its membership of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and has allowed detailed examination of the signaling and regulatory pathways utilized by this receptor . This article examines the current state of knowledge of the IP , its signaling and regulation , and its biological role in vivo and examines the possible existence of multiple P43119 sites .
