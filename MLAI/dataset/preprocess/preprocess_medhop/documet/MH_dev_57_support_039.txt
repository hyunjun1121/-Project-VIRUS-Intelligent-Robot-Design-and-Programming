Use of RNA interference to elucidate the effect of P04198 on cell cycle in neuroblastoma . BACKGROUND : P04198 amplification marks poor prognosis in neuroblastoma ( NB ) tumors . In evaluating the mechanisms by which retinoic acid ( RA ) or nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) decrease cell number in P04198 amplified NB cells , we have identified a number of proteins whose expression either decreases ( E2F , P06493 , Q00534 , cyclin dependent kinase activity ) or increases ( p27 ) in association with a decrease in P04198 expression . However , it was still unclear which were P04198 dependent effects or not . PROCEDURE : This study aimed to determine which changes in cell cycle gene expression are modulated as a consequence of the decrease in P04198 . We silenced P04198 expression using siRNA targeted to the coding region of P04198 . Then , by using siRNA transient transfections , we analyzed the change of cell cycle related genes and cell cycle in P04198 amplified NB cell lines . RESULTS : We demonstrate that expression of P04198 can be suppressed by almost 60 % in P04198 amplified NB cell using siRNAs targeted to P04198 . Functionally , the decrease in P04198 leads to a decrease in cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle . Decreases in P04198 are associated with decreases in Q01094 -2 and Q02363 along with increases in p27 protein levels by post-transcriptional modification . Moreover , we find that a decrease in P04198 is accompanied by a decrease in cdk6 mRNA and protein expression . CONCLUSIONS : These results show that E2F and Q02363 expression is associated with P04198 regulation and that cdk6 is a possible new transcriptional target of P04198 .
