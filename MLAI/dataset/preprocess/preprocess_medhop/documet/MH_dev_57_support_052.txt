Farnesoid X receptor protects liver cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in vitro and fasting in vivo . The farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) is a key metabolic regulator in the liver by maintaining the homeostasis of liver metabolites . Recent findings suggest that Q96RI1 may have a much broader function in liver physiology and pathology . In the present work , we identify a novel role of Q96RI1 in protecting liver cell from apoptosis induced by nutritional withdrawal including serum deprivation in vitro or starvation in vivo . Two Q96RI1 ligands , chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) and GW4064 , rescued HepG2 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner . This effect of Q96RI1 on apoptotic suppression was compromised when Q96RI1 was knocked down by short interfering RNA . Similarly , the effects of both DB06777 and GW4064 were abolished after inhibition of the MAPK pathway by a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1/2 . Immunoblotting results indicated that Q96RI1 activation by DB06777 and GW4064 induced P27361 /2 phosphorylation , which was attenuated by serum deprivation . In vivo , Q96RI1 (-/-) mice exhibited an exacerbated liver apoptosis and lower levels of phosphorylated- P27361 /2 compared to wild-type mice after starvation . In conclusion , our results suggest a novel role of Q96RI1 in modulating liver cell apoptosis .
