Simvastatin , an P04035 inhibitor , exhibits anti-metastatic and anti-tumorigenic effects in endometrial cancer . OBJECTIVE : Our goal was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cultures of endometrial cancer cells . METHODS : Cell proliferation in the ECC-1 and Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cultures of endometrial cancer cells was assessed by MTT assay . Apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by P08758 assay and propidium iodide staining , respectively . Reactive oxygen species and cell adhesion were assessed using ELISA assays . Invasion was analyzed using a transwell invasion assay . Mitochondrial DNA damage was confirmed using qPCR . The effects of simvastatin on the AKT/ P42345 and MAPK pathways were determined by Western blotting . RESULTS : Simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in both endometrial cancer cell lines and 5/8 primary cultures of endometrial cancer cells . Simvastatin treatment resulted in P55008 cell cycle arrest , a reduction in the enzymatic activity of HMG- DB01992 , induction of apoptosis as well as DNA damage and cellular stress . Treatment with simvastatin resulted in inhibition of the MAPK pathway and exhibited differential effects on the AKT/ P42345 pathway in the ECC-1 and Ishikawa cells . Minimal change in AKT phosphorylation was seen in both cell lines . An increase in phosphorylated S6 was seen in ECC-1 and a decrease was seen in Ishikawa . Treatment with simvastatin reduced cell adhesion and invasion ( p < 0.01 ) in both cell lines . CONCLUSION : Simvastatin had significant anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects in endometrial cancer cells , possibly through modulation of the MAPK and AKT/ P42345 pathways , suggesting that statins may be a promising treatment strategy for endometrial cancer .
