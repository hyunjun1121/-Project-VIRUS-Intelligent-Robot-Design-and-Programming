Pharmacophore-based virtual screening versus docking-based virtual screening : a benchmark comparison against eight targets . AIM : This study was conducted to compare the efficiencies of two virtual screening approaches , pharmacophore-based virtual screening ( PBVS ) and docking-based virtual screening ( DBVS ) methods . METHODS : All virtual screens were performed on two data sets of small molecules with both actives and decoys against eight structurally diverse protein targets , namely angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) , acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) , androgen receptor ( AR ) , D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase ( DacA ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , estrogen receptors alpha ( ERalpha ) , HIV-1 protease ( HIV-pr ) , and thymidine kinase ( TK ) . Each pharmacophore model was constructed based on several X-ray structures of protein-ligand complexes . Virtual screens were performed using four screening standards , the program Catalyst for PBVS and three docking programs ( DOCK , GOLD and Glide ) for DBVS . RESULTS : Of the sixteen sets of virtual screens ( one target versus two testing databases ) , the enrichment factors of fourteen cases using the PBVS method were higher than those using DBVS methods . The average hit rates over the eight targets at 2 % and 5 % of the highest ranks of the entire databases for PBVS are much higher than those for DBVS . CONCLUSION : The PBVS method outperformed DBVS methods in retrieving actives from the databases in our tested targets , and is a powerful method in drug discovery .
