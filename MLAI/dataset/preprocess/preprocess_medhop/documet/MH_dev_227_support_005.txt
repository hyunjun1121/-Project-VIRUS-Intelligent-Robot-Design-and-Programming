Microarray analyses of the effects of NF-kappaB or PI3K pathway inhibitors on the LPS-induced gene expression profile in RAW264.7 cells : synergistic effects of rapamycin on LPS-induced P14780 -overexpression . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates a broad range of signalling pathways including mainly NF-kappaB and the MAPK cascade , but recent evidence suggests that LPS stimulation also activates the PI3K pathway . To unravel the specific roles of both pathways in LPS signalling and gene expression profiling , we investigated the effects of different inhibitors of NF-kappaB ( BAY 11-7082 ) , PI3K ( wortmannin and LY294002 ) but also of P42345 ( rapamycin ) , a kinase acting downstream of PI3K/Akt , in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages , analyzing their effects on the LPS-induced gene expression profile using a low density DNA microarray designed to monitor the expression of pro-inflammatory genes . After statistical and hierarchical cluster analyses , we determined five clusters of genes differentially affected by the four inhibitors used . In the fifth cluster corresponding to genes upregulated by LPS and mainly affected by BAY 11-7082 , the gene encoding P14780 displayed a particular expression profile , since rapamycin drastically enhanced the LPS-induced upregulation at both the mRNA and protein levels . DB00877 also enhanced the LPS-induced NF-kappaB transactivation as determined by a reporter assay , phosphorylation of the p38 and Erk1/2 MAPKs , and counteracted Q07869 activity . These results suggest that P42345 could negatively regulate the effects of LPS on the NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways . We also performed real-time RT-PCR assays on mmp9 expression using rosiglitazone ( agonist of PPARgamma ) , PD98059 ( inhibitor of Erk 1/2 ) and SB203580 ( inhibitor of p38(MAPK) ) , that were able to counteract the rapamycin mediated overexpression of mmp9 in response to LPS . Our results suggest a new pathway involving P42345 for regulating specifically mmp9 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells .
