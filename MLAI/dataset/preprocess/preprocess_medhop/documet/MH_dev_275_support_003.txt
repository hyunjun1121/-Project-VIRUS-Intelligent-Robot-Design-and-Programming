Regulation of Q9BYW2 {alpha} activity in adipose tissue by obesity-associated factors : adipogenesis , insulin , and hypoxia . The transcription factor HIF-1α activity is increased in adipose tissue to contribute to chronic inflammation in obesity . However , its upstream and downstream events remain to be characterized in adipose tissue in obesity . We addressed this issue by investigating adipocyte HIF-1α activity in response to obesity-associated factors , such as adipogenesis , insulin , and hypoxia . In adipose tissue , both HIF-1α mRNA and protein were increased by obesity . The underlying mechanism was investigated in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . HIF-1α mRNA and protein were augmented by adipocyte differentiation . In differentiated adipocytes , insulin further enhanced HIF-1α in both levels . Hypoxia enhanced only HIF-1α protein , not mRNA . PI3K and P42345 activities are required for the HIF-1α expression . Function of HIF-1α protein was investigated in the regulation of P15692 gene transcription . ChIP assay shows that HIF-1α binds to the proximal hypoxia response element in the P15692 gene promoter , and its function is inhibited by a corepressor composed of O15379 and Q9Y618 . These observations suggest that of the three obesity-associated factors , all of them are able to augment HIF-1α protein levels , but only two ( adipogenesis and insulin ) are able to enhance HIF-1α mRNA activity . Adipose tissue HIF-1α activity is influenced by multiple signals , including adipogenesis , insulin , and hypoxia in obesity . The transcriptional activity of HIF-1α is inhibited by O15379 - Q9Y618 corepressor in the P15692 gene promoter .
