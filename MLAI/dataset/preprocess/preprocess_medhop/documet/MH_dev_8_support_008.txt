Point mutation of the somatostatin receptor 2 gene in the human small cell lung cancer cell line COR-L103 . The effect of somatostatin ( SS ) on adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) secretion from COR-L103 cells derived from a human small cell lung carcinoma was examined . SS at 1 microM had no effect on DB01285 secretion from the cells on either short-term or long-term incubation . Studies by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed that mRNA transcripts of the somatostatin receptor ( SSTR ) 2 , P32745 and P31391 genes were present in COR-L103 cells . Extra bands were obtained by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis of the P30874 gene Sequence analysis of the P30874 gene demonstrated one point mutation in codon 188 of TGG for tryptophan to TGA for a stop codon causing loss of 182 C-terminal amino acid residues of P30874 . The nucleotide sequences of the P32745 and P31391 genes in COR-L103 cells were normal . Binding studies using 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 showed specific affinity binding sites on COR-L103 cells and mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 cells . DB00104 acetate suppressed the binding of 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 to these two cell lines , but the Kd of COR-L103 cells ( 160 nM ) was 60-fold higher than that of AtT-20 cells ( 2.6 nM ) . Affinity cross-linking studies using 125I-Tyr11-SS-14 gave three bands of 72 KDa , 55 KDa and 32 KDa from AtT-20 cells , but only two bands of 55KDa and 32kDa from COR-L103 cells . These findings suggest that P30874 is not expressed in the plasma membranes of COR-L103 cells due to a point mutation , but that this may have no influence on the effect of SS on DB01285 secretion .
