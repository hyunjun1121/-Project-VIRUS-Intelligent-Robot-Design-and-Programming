Two different P01579 nonresponsive variants derived from the B-cell lymphoma 70Z/3 . The kappa immunoglobulin ( Igk ) light chain locus is transcriptionally silent in the mouse B-cell lymphoma 70Z/3 . However , exposure to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or interferon-gamma ( IFN ) causes a marked increase in Igk transcription . By immunoselection , we isolated two variants that are nonresponsive to IFN . One variant , AT7.2 , has retained its response to LPS ( IFN-LPS+ ) , whereas the other , P01008 .3 , is also nonresponsive to LPS ( IFN-LPS- ) . Stable transfection of an intact Igk gene does not rescue the phenotype of either variant . Both variants have intact Igk genes and neither is deficient in the binding or uptake of IFN . Nuclear extracts from LPS-treated wild-type 70Z/3 cells show strong increases in three transcription factors : P09086 , NF-kappa B , and kBF-A . Remarkably , when the IFN-LPS- variant is treated with LPS , all three transcription factors are still observed in the nuclear extracts . Treatment of wild-type cells with either LPS or IFN also causes a decrease in nuclear complexes that bind to two other regions of the Igk intron enhancer , the octenh and the E kappa MHCIC regions . Both of these changes are also observed after LPS or IFN treatment of the IFN-LPS- variant . Thus , this variant transduces the IFN and LPS signals at least into the nuclear compartment , but still fails to activate Igk transcription . In contrast , the IFN-LPS+ variant decreases neither the octenh nor the E kappa MHCIC binding complexes in response to IFN . This variant may be defective in transducing the IFN signal to the nucleus . These variants will be useful in studying the activation of Igk transcription and the IFN signaling pathway in B cells .
