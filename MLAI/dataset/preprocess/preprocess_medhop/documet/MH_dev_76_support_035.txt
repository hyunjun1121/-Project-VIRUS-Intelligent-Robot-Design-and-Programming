Agonists of the Q9H244 -receptor activate Q96HU1 kinase by a ras-independent pathway in rat P13671 glioma . We have previously shown that an ecto-NPPase modulates the DB00171 - and ADP-mediated Q9H244 -receptor activation in rat P13671 glioma . In the present study , 2MeSADP and Ap(3)A induced no detectable PI turnover and were identified as specific agonists of the Q9H244 -receptor with EC(50) values of 250 +/- 37 pM and 1 +/- 0.5 microM , respectively . Q9H244 -receptor stimulation increased Q96HU1 kinase ( P27361 /2 ) activation that returned to the basal level 4 h after stimulation and was correlated with a gradual desensitization of the Q9H244 -purinoceptor . The purinoceptor antagonists DIDS and Q08999 blocked Q96HU1 kinase activation . An IP(3)-independent Ca(2+)-influx was observed after Q9H244 -receptor activation . Inhibition of this influx by Ca(2+)-chelation , did not affect Q96HU1 kinase activation . Pertussis toxin , toxin B , selective PKC-inhibitors and a specific MEK-inhibitor inhibited the 2MeSADP- and Ap(3)A-induced Q96HU1 kinase activation . In addition , transfection with dominant negative RhoA(Asn19) rendered P13671 cells insensitive to Q9H244 -receptor-mediated Q96HU1 kinase activation whereas dominant negative ras was without effect . Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated a significant increase in the phosphorylation of raf-1 after Q9H244 -receptor activation . We may conclude that Q9H244 -purinoceptor agonists activate Q96HU1 kinase through a G(i)-RhoA-PKC-raf-MEK-dependent , but ras- and Ca(2+)-independent cascade .
