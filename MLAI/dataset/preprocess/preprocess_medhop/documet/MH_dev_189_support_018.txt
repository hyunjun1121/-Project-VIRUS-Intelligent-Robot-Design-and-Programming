The role of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor ( Q99062 ) in disease . P09919 ( DB00099 ) is a key regulator of granulopoiesis via stimulation of a specific cell-surface receptor , the Q99062 , found on hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as neutrophilic granulocytes . It is perhaps not surprising , therefore , that mutations of the Q99062 has been implicated in several clinical settings that affect granulocytic differentiation , particularly severe congenital neutropenia , myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia . However , other studies suggest that signalling via the Q99062 is also involved in a range of other malignancies . This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which the Q99062 contributes to disease .
