N-arachidonoyl-L-serine is neuroprotective after traumatic brain injury by reducing apoptosis . N-arachidonoyl-L-serine ( AraS ) is a brain component structurally related to the endocannabinoid family . We investigated the neuroprotective effects of AraS following closed head injury induced by weight drop onto the exposed fronto-parietal skull and the mechanisms involved . A single injection of AraS following injury led to a significant improvement in functional outcome , and to reduced edema and lesion volume compared with vehicle . Specific antagonists to CB2 receptors , transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( Q8NER1 ) or large conductance calcium-activated potassium ( BK ) channels reversed these effects . Specific binding assays did not indicate binding of AraS to the Q9Y2T6 cannabinoid receptor . N-arachidonoyl-L-serine blocked the attenuation in phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P29323 ) levels and led to an increase in pAkt in both the ipsilateral and contralateral cortices . Increased levels of the prosurvival factor Bcl-xL were evident 24 hours after injury in AraS-treated mice , followed by a 30 % reduction in caspase-3 activity , measured 3 days after injury . Treatment with a CB2 antagonist , but not with a P21554 antagonist , reversed this effect . Our results suggest that administration of AraS leads to neuroprotection via P29323 and Akt phosphorylation and induction of their downstream antiapoptotic pathways . These protective effects are related mostly to indirect signaling via the CB2R and Q8NER1 channels but not through P21554 or Q9Y2T6 receptors .
