Sequencing a mouse acute promyelocytic leukemia genome reveals genetic events relevant for disease progression . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It is characterized by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that creates the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor Î± ( P29590 - P10276 ) fusion oncogene . Although this fusion oncogene is known to initiate APL in mice , other cooperating mutations , as yet ill defined , are important for disease pathogenesis . To identify these , we used a mouse model of APL , whereby P29590 - P10276 expressed in myeloid cells leads to a myeloproliferative disease that ultimately evolves into APL . Sequencing of a mouse APL genome revealed 3 somatic , nonsynonymous mutations relevant to APL pathogenesis , of which 1 ( Jak1 V657F ) was found to be recurrent in other affected mice . This mutation was identical to the P23458 V658F mutation previously found in human APL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples . Further analysis showed that P23458 V658F cooperated in vivo with P29590 - P10276 , causing a rapidly fatal leukemia in mice . We also discovered a somatic 150-kb deletion involving the lysine ( K ) -specific demethylase 6A ( Kdm6a , also known as Utx ) gene , in the mouse APL genome . Similar deletions were observed in 3 out of 14 additional mouse APL samples and 1 out of 150 human AML samples . In conclusion , whole genome sequencing of mouse cancer genomes can provide an unbiased and comprehensive approach for discovering functionally relevant mutations that are also present in human leukemias .
