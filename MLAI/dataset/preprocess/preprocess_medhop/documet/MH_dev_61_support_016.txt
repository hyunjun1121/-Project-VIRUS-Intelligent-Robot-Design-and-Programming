P01138 regulates the PC12 cell cycle machinery through specific inhibition of the Cdk kinases and induction of cyclin D1 . We have examined the effects of P01138 on components of the PC12 cell cycle machinery . We show that P01138 represses over 6-8 d the levels of specific cdk kinase proteins and the G2-M phase specific cyclin B1 and the S phase marker P12004 as well as the level of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) protein . All of these changes may provide a basis for a P01138 block to cell cycling . Unexpectedly , the P55008 phase-specific cyclin D1 was dramatically increased by inducers of differentiation ( P01138 and FGF ) , but not by inducers of proliferation ( P01133 and insulin ) . Although the levels of cyclin D1/cdk2 and cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes increased following P01138 treatment , as did cyclin D1/ P06400 complexes , the associated kinase activities declined , indicating that P01138 also induces an inhibitor of cdk kinase activity . In agreement , P01138 induced the cdk inhibitory protein , P38936 , which was found in cyclin D1/cdk kinase complexes after P01138 treatment . We show that vector over expression of cyclin D1 in PC12 is sufficient on its own to arrest the cells in P55008 phase and inhibit expression of P12004 . These results indicate that P01138 induction of cyclin D1 and inactivation of cdk kinases , the latter possibly by increase of P38936 , play a central role in the P01138 block of PC12 cell cycling .
