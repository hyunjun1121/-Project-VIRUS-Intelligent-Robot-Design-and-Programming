Down-regulated P13569 During Aging Contributes to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia . Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) is a hyper-proliferative disease of the aging prostate ; however , the exact mechanism underlying the development of BPH remains incompletely understood . The present study investigated the possible involvement of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , which has been previously shown to negatively regulate nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) /cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) /prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) pathway , in the pathogenesis of BPH . Our results showed decreasing P13569 and increasing P35354 expression in rat prostate tissues with aging . Furthermore , suppression of P13569 led to increased expression of P35354 and over-production of DB00917 in a normal human prostate epithelial cell line ( PNT1A ) with elevated NF-κB activity . DB00917 stimulated the proliferation of primary rat prostate stromal cells but not epithelial cells , with increased P12004 expression . In addition , the condition medium from PNT1A cells after inhibition or knockdown of P13569 promoted cell proliferation of prostate stromal cells which could be reversed by P35354 or NF-κB inhibitor . More importantly , the involvement of P13569 in BPH was further demonstrated by the down-regulation of P13569 and up-regulation of P35354 /NF-κB in human BPH samples . The present results suggest that P13569 may be involved in regulating DB00917 production through its negative regulation on NF-κB/ P35354 pathway in prostate epithelial cells , which consequently stimulates cell growth of prostate stromal cells . The overstimulation of prostate stromal cell proliferation by down-regulation of P13569 -enhanced DB00917 production and release during aging may contribute to the development of BPH .
