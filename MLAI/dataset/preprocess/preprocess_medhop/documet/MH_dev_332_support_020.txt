Shared and unique signals of high-altitude adaptation in geographically distinct Tibetan populations . Recent studies have used a variety of analytical methods to identify genes targeted by selection in high-altitude populations located throughout the Tibetan Plateau . Despite differences in analytic strategies and sample location , hypoxia-related genes , including Q99814 and Q9GZT9 , were identified in multiple studies . By applying the same analytic methods to genome-wide SNP information used in our previous study of a Tibetan population ( n = 31 ) from the township of Maduo , located in the northeastern corner of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau ( 4200 m ) , we have identified common targets of natural selection in a second geographically and linguistically distinct Tibetan population ( n = 46 ) in the Tuo Tuo River township ( 4500 m ) . Our analyses provide evidence for natural selection based on iHS and XP-EHH signals in both populations at the p < 0.02 significance level for Q99814 , Q9GZT9 , P30519 , and P05093 and for P30613 , Q30201 , and P68871 and P69892 , which have also been reported in other studies . We highlight differences ( i.e. , stratification and admixture ) in the two distinct Tibetan groups examined here and report selection candidate genes common to both groups . These findings should be considered in the prioritization of selection candidate genes in future genetic studies in Tibet .
