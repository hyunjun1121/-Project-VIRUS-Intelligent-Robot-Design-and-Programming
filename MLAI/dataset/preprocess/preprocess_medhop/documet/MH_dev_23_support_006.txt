P02649 : a potent inhibitor of endothelial and tumor cell proliferation . Recombinant human apolipoprotein E3 ( apoE ) , purified from E. coli , inhibited the proliferation of several cell types , including endothelial cells and tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . ApoE inhibited both de novo DNA synthesis and proliferation as assessed by an increase in cell number . Maximal inhibition of cell growth by apoE was achieved under conditions where proliferation was dependent on heparin-binding growth factors . Thus , at low serum concentrations ( 0-2.5 % ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) stimulated the proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial ( BAE ) cells severalfold . The P09038 -dependent proliferation was dramatically inhibited by apoE with an IC50 approximately 50 nM . Under conditions where cell proliferation was mainly serum-dependent , apoE also suppressed growth but required higher concentrations to be effective ( IC50 approximately 500 nM ) . ApoE also inhibited growth of bovine corneal endothelial cells , human melanoma cells , and human breast carcinoma cells . The IC50 values obtained with these cells were generally 3-5 times higher than with BAE cells . Inhibition of cell proliferation by apoE was reversible and dependent on the time of apoE addition to the culture . In addition , apoE inhibited the chemotactic response of endothelial cells that were induced to migrate by a gradient of soluble P09038 . Inhibition of cell proliferation by apoE may be mediated both by competition for growth factor binding to proteoglycans and by an antiadhesive activity of apoE . The present results demonstrate that apoE is a potent inhibitor of proliferation of several cell types and suggest that apoE may be effective in modulating angiogenesis , tumor cell growth , and metastasis .
