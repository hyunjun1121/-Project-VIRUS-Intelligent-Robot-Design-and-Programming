Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation inhibits tumor metastasis by antagonizing P84022 -mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was shown to confer tumor cells with abilities essential for metastasis , including migratory phenotype , invasiveness , resistance to apoptosis , evading immune surveillance , and tumor stem cell traits . Therefore , inhibition of EMT can be an important therapeutic strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis . Here , we show that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( Q07869 -γ ) inhibits transforming growth factor β ( TGF-β ) -induced EMT in lung cancer cells and prevents metastasis by antagonizing P84022 function . Activation of Q07869 -γ by synthetic ligands ( troglitazone and rosiglitazone ) or by a constitutively active form of Q07869 -γ prevents TGF-β-induced loss of P12830 expression and inhibits the induction of mesenchymal markers ( vimentin , P19022 , fibronectin ) and matrix metalloproteases . Consistently , activation of Q07869 -γ also inhibited EMT-induced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells . Furthermore , effects of Q07869 -γ ligands were attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Q07869 -γ , indicating that the ligand-induced responses are Q07869 -γ dependent . Selective knockdown of Q15796 and P84022 by siRNA showed that TGF-β-induced EMT is P84022 dependent in lung cancer cells . Activation of Q07869 -γ inhibits TGF-β-induced Smad transcriptional activity but had no effect on the phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of Smads . Consistently , Q07869 -γ activation prevented TGF-β-induced transcriptional repression of P12830 promoter and inhibited transcriptional activation of P19022 promoter . Finally , treatment of mice with troglitazone or knockdown of P84022 in tumor cells significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced experimental metastasis in SCID-Beige mice . Together , with the low toxicity profile of Q07869 -γ ligands , our data show that these ligands may serve as potential therapeutic agents to inhibit metastasis .
