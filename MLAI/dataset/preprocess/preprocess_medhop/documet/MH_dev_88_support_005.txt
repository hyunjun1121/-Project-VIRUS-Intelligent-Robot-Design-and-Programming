Growth hormone and glucose metabolism : the model of the GH-receptor antagonists . DB00082 is a GH analogue that includes a single amino acid substitution at position 120 that generates the P10912 antagonist . Additional changes include amino acid substitutions within binding site 1 and a further modification by the addition of polyethylene glycol moieties that increase the half-life and reduce the immunogenicity of the molecule . In acromegalics , pegvisomant is the most effective treatment for normalizing the P05019 , and pegvisomant significantly improves insulin sensitivity in patients suffering from acromegaly . However , there are simply no data available that might support a role for pegvisomant treatment in disorders in which glucose metabolism is disturbed and in which reducing GH action would be theoretically beneficial .
