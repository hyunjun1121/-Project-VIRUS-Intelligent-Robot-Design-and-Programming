All-trans retinoic acid regulates hepatic bile acid homeostasis . Retinoic acid ( RA ) and bile acids share common roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity . In addition , the receptor for RA ( retinoid x receptor ) is a permissive partner of the receptor for bile acids , farnesoid x receptor ( Q96RI1 / Q96RI1 ) . Thus , RA can activate the Q96RI1 -mediated pathway as well . The current study was designed to understand the effect of all-trans RA on bile acid homeostasis . Mice were fed an all-trans RA-supplemented diet and the expression of 46 genes that participate in regulating bile acid homeostasis was studied . The data showed that all-trans RA has a profound effect in regulating genes involved in synthesis and transport of bile acids . All-trans RA treatment reduced the gene expression levels of Cyp7a1 , Cyp8b1 , and Akr1d1 , which are involved in bile acid synthesis . All-trans RA also decreased the hepatic mRNA levels of Lrh-1 ( Nr5a2 ) and Hnf4Î± ( Nr2a1 ) , which positively regulate the gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 . Moreover , all-trans RA induced the gene expression levels of negative regulators of bile acid synthesis including hepatic Fgfr4 , Fxr , and Shp ( Nr0b2 ) as well as ileal Fgf15 . All-trans RA also decreased the expression of Abcb11 and Slc51b , which have a role in bile acid transport . Consistently , all-trans RA reduced hepatic bile acid levels and the ratio of CA/ DB06777 , as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . The data suggest that all-trans RA-induced Q15466 may contribute to the inhibition of P22680 and Q9UNU6 , which in turn reduces bile acid synthesis and affects lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract .
