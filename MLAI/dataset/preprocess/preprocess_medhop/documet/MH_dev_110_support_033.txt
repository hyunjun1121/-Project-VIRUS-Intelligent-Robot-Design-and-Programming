Delta(9)- DB00470 enhances MCF-7 cell proliferation via cannabinoid receptor-independent signaling . We recently reported that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta(9)-THC ) has the ability to stimulate the proliferation of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells . However , the mechanism of action remains to be clarified . The present study focused on the relationship between receptor expression and the effects of Delta(9)-THC on cell proliferation . RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that there was no detectable expression of CB receptors in MCF-7 cells . In accordance with this , no effects of cannabinoid 1/2 ( P21554 /2 ) receptor antagonists and pertussis toxin on cell proliferation were observed . Although MCF-7 cell proliferation is suggested to be suppressed by Delta(9)-THC in the presence of CB receptors , it was revealed that Delta(9)-THC could exert upregulation of living cells in the absence of the receptors . Interestingly , Delta(9)-THC upregulated human epithelial growth factor receptor type 2 ( P04626 ) expression , which is known to be a predictive factor of human breast cancer and is able to stimulate cancer cells as well as MCF-7 cells . DB00970 -treatment interfered with the upregulation of P04626 and cell proliferation by cannabinoid . Taken together , these studies suggest that , in the absence of CB receptors , Delta(9)-THC can stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 cells by modulating , at least in part , P04626 transcription .
