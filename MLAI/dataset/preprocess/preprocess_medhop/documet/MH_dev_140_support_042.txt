Cytokines as targets in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ P48444 ] is characterised by airflow limitation of peripheral airways that is not fully reversible and progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases . There is also intense airway wall remodelling and evidence of systemic inflammation . Increased interleukin [ IL ] -6 , IL-1beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ P01375 ] , P09341 -alpha , P13500 and P10145 levels are measured in sputum , with further increases during exacerbations . The bronchiolar epithelium over-expresses P13500 , MIP-1alpha and P10145 . P10145 can account for sputum neutrophil chemotactic activity . TNFalpha and IL-1beta stimulate macrophages to produce matrix metalloproteinase-9 [ P14780 ] , and bronchial epithelial cells to produce extracellular matrix glycoproteins . Increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta [ TGFbeta ) and epidermal growth factor [ P01133 ] occurs in the epithelium and submucosal cells ; gene array studies reveal an excess of TGFbeta1 , P29279 and P16234 in P48444 . TGFbeta and P01133 activate proliferation of fibroblasts , while activation of the P01133 receptor leads to mucin gene expression . Anti-cytokine therapy could be in the form of soluble receptors or by neutralising antibodies , small compounds blocking cytokine receptors or incomplete and non-activating cytokines , inhibitors of protein activation and inhibitors of signal transduction and transcription such as via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases [ MAPK ] and of transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB . Anti- P10145 therapy has been tried with little effect on P48444 , and current trials are on-going with P01375 inhibitors . Other treatments such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors have anti-cytokine effects that may underlie their beneficial effects in P48444 .
