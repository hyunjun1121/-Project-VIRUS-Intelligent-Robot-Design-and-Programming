DB08875 inhibits prostate cancer growth and prevents tumor-induced bone lesions . PURPOSE : DB08875 , an orally available multityrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( MET ) and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) , induces resolution of bone scan lesions in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases . The purpose of this study was to determine whether cabozantinib elicited a direct antitumor effect , an indirect effect through modulating bone , or both . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Using human prostate cancer xenograft studies in mice , we determined the impact of cabozantinib on tumor growth in soft tissue and bone . In vitro studies with cabozantinib were performed using ( i ) prostate cancer cell lines to evaluate its impact on cell growth , invasive ability , and MET and ( ii ) osteoblast cell lines to evaluate its impact on viability and differentiation and P35968 . RESULTS : DB08875 inhibited progression of multiple prostate cancer cell lines ( Ace-1 , C4-2B , and LuCaP 35 ) in bone metastatic and soft tissue murine models of prostate cancer , except for PC-3 prostate cancer cells in which it inhibited only subcutaneous growth . DB08875 directly inhibited prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and inhibited cell invasion in vitro . DB08875 had a dose-dependent biphasic effect on osteoblast activity and inhibitory effect on osteoclast production in vitro that was reflected in vivo . It blocked MET and P35968 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells and osteoblast-like cells , respectively . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that cabozantinib has direct antitumor activity , and that its ability to modulate osteoblast activity may contribute to its antitumor efficacy .
