The genetics of alcoholism : identifying specific genes through family studies . Alcoholism is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental risk factors . Studies in humans have begun to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of the risk for alcoholism . Here we briefly review strategies for identifying individual genes in which variations affect the risk for alcoholism and related phenotypes , in the context of one large study that has successfully identified such genes . The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism ( COGA ) is a family-based study that has collected detailed phenotypic data on individuals in families with multiple alcoholic members . A genome-wide linkage approach led to the identification of chromosomal regions containing genes that influenced alcoholism risk and related phenotypes . Subsequently , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were genotyped in positional candidate genes located within the linked chromosomal regions , and analyzed for association with these phenotypes . Using this sequential approach , COGA has detected association with P47869 , P08172 and P08319 ; these associations have all been replicated by other researchers . COGA has detected association to additional genes including Q99928 , Q9NYV7 , P37840 , P41145 and P01213 , results that are awaiting confirmation . These successes demonstrate that genes contributing to the risk for alcoholism can be reliably identified using human subjects .
