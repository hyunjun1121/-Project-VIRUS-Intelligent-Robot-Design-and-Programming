Antisense inhibition of vitamin D receptor expression induces apoptosis in monoblastoid U937 cells . The active vitamin D3 metabolite DB00136 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) acts as an antiproliferative and differentiating agent for the monoblastoid cell line U937 and as an important immunologic mediator implicated particularly in the function of cells belonging to the monocyte/macrophage lineage . These effects are controlled by the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , a member of the steroid hormone receptor family . The objective of this study was to develop U937 transfectants expressing antisense P11473 mRNA , and to use these to examine the role of 1,25(OH)2D3- P11473 interaction in this lineage . A 2-kb P11473 cDNA insert ( including the complete P11473 coding region ) was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EBV episomal vector pMEP4 under the control of an inducible promoter and transfected into U937 . The resultant cell line , DH42 , was hygromycin resistant , contained P11473 cDNA , expressed fewer VDRs than controls , and showed a substantial decrease in antiproliferative response to 1,25(OH)2D3 . However , 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the number of cells expressing macrophage cell surface Ags , including P08571 and CD11b . A subpopulation of smaller cells did not express the differentiation markers after cadmium stimulation . Cell cycle analysis showed shifts in the distribution of cells from P55008 to S phase , which were more pronounced after cadmium treatment . A considerable proportion of cells were outside the cycle and DNA fragmentation confirmed apoptosis . Thus , the functional outcome of the P11473 antisense transfection suggests that in the myelomonocytic lineage , P11473 expression may act as a protective mechanism against programmed cell death .
