Targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor enhances gene transfer to human airway epithelia . Developing gene therapy for cystic fibrosis has been hindered by limited binding and endocytosis of vectors by human airway epithelia . Here we show that the apical membrane of airway epithelia express the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , or a 7-residue peptide derived from this protein ( u7-peptide ) , bound the receptor and stimulated apical endocytosis . Both ligands enhanced gene transfer by nonspecifically bound adenovirus and adeno-associated virus vectors and by a modified adenovirus vector that had been coupled to the u7-peptide . These data provide the first evidence that targeting an apical receptor can circumvent the two most important barriers to gene transfer in airway epithelia . Thus , the uPA/ Q03405 system may offer significant advantages for delivering genes and other pharmaceuticals to airway epithelia .
