Discovery and role of methylidene imidazolone , a highly electrophilic prosthetic group . The elimination of ammonia from alpha-amino acids is a chemically difficult process . While the non-acidic beta-proton has to be abstracted , the much more acidic ammonium protons must remain untouched to maintain the leaving group ability of this positively charged group . DB00117 and phenylalanine ammonia-lyases ( P42357 and Q9P2V4 ) possess a catalytically essential electrophilic group which has been believed to be dehydroalanine for 30 years . Recently , the X-ray structure of P42357 has been solved . The electron density was not consistent with dehydroalanine but showed the presence of methylidene imidazolone ( Q9NP71 ) instead . The high electrophilicity of this prosthetic group as well as the geometry at the active site support a previously proposed mechanism involving a Friedel-Crafts-type attack at the aromatic ring of the substrate . Further biochemical evidence for this unprecedented electrophile-assisted ammonia elimination is also presented . Although no X-ray structure of Q9P2V4 has been published as yet , spectrophotometrical evidence for the presence of Q9NP71 has been provided . Finally , a chemical model for the Q9P2V4 reaction is described .
