A maternal high-fat diet modulates fetal Q96EB6 histone and protein deacetylase activity in nonhuman primates . In nonhuman primates , we previously demonstrated that a maternal high-fat diet ( MHFD ) induces fetal nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) and alters the fetal metabolome . These changes are accompanied by altered acetylation of histone H3 ( H3K14ac ) . However , the mechanism behind this alteration in acetylation remains unknown . As Q96EB6 is both a lysine deacetylase and a crucial sensor of cellular metabolism , we hypothesized that Q96EB6 may be involved in fetal epigenomic alterations . Here we show that in utero exposure to a MHFD , but not maternal obesity per se , increases fetal H3K14ac with concomitant decreased Q96EB6 expression and diminished in vitro protein and histone deacetylase activity . MHFD increased H3K14ac and DBC1- Q96EB6 complex formation in fetal livers , both of which were abrogated with diet reversal despite persistent maternal obesity . Moreover , MHFD was associated with altered expression of known downstream effectors deregulated in NAFLD and modulated by Q96EB6 ( e.g. , PPARÎ‘ , P37231 , P36956 , P22680 , P49327 , and O00767 ) . Finally , ex vivo purified Q96EB6 retains deacetylase activity on an H3K14ac peptide substrate with preferential activity toward acetylated histone H3 ; mutagenesis of the catalytic domain of Q96EB6 ( H363Y ) abrogates H3K14ac deacetylation . Our data implicate Q96EB6 as a likely molecular mediator of the fetal epigenome and metabolome under MHFD conditions .
