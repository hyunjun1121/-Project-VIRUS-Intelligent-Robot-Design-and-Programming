P01375 polymorphisms as a potential modifier gene in the cystic fibrosis . Modifier genes , as the P01375 -α gene , can modulate the cystic fibrosis ( CF ) severity . Thus , -238G > A and -308G > A polymorphisms of P01375 -α gene were analyzed as modifiers of CF . In this context , the present study enrolled 49 CF patients ( diagnosis performed by sweat test and complete P13569 screening ) . The -238G > A polymorphism analysis was performed by Q9ULH0 -PCR , and -308G > A , by PCR-RFLP . In our data , the -238G > A polymorphism was not associated with clinical variability . The AA genotype for -308G > A polymorphism was a risk factor for early gastrointestinal symptoms ( OR=5.98 , 95 % CI=1.06-49.68 ) and protection for the first Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( OR=0.05 , 95 % CI=0.0003-0.007 ) . For the first P. aeruginosa , GA genotype was a risk factor ( OR=10.2 , 95 % CI=1.86-84.09 ) ; for the same genotype , the diagnosis was made in minor time than the AA genotype ( p=0.031 ) . Considering the -308G > A polymorphism alleles , the G allele was a risk factor for early pulmonary symptoms ( OR=3.81 , 95 % CI=1.13-12.97 ) and P. aeruginosa ( OR=66.77 , 95 % CI=15.18-482.7 ) ; however , the same allele showed better transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( OR=9.24 , 95 % CI=1.53-206.1 ) . The A allele was a protective factor for early pulmonary symptoms ( OR=12.26 , 95 % CI=0.08-0.89 ) and P. aeruginosa ( OR=12.15 , 95 % CI=0002-0007 ) , however , the same allele was a risk factor for worst transcutaneous oxygen saturation ( OR=7.01 , 95 % CI=1.14-157.4 ) . As conclusion , the -308G > A polymorphism of the P01375 -α gene was associated with the CF severity .
