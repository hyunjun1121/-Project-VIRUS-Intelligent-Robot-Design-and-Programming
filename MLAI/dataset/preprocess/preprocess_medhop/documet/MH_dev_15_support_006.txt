P00533 variant III mutations in lung tumorigenesis and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . The tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib ( DB00317 ) and erlotinib ( Tarceva ) have shown anti-tumor activity in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Dramatic and durable responses have occurred in NSCLC tumors with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . In contrast , these inhibitors have shown limited efficacy in glioblastoma , where a distinct P00533 mutation , the variant III ( vIII ) in-frame deletion of exons 2-7 , is commonly found . In this study , we determined that EGFRvIII mutation was present in 5 % ( 3/56 ) of analyzed human lung squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) but was not present in human lung adenocarcinoma ( 0/123 ) . We analyzed the role of the EGFRvIII mutation in lung tumorigenesis and its response to tyrosine kinase inhibition . Tissue-specific expression of EGFRvIII in the murine lung led to the development of NSCLC . Most importantly , these lung tumors depend on EGFRvIII expression for maintenance . Treatment with an irreversible P00533 inhibitor , HKI-272 , dramatically reduced the size of these EGFRvIII-driven murine tumors in 1 week . Similarly , Ba/ P13726 cells transformed with the EGFRvIII mutant were relatively resistant to gefitinib and erlotinib in vitro but proved sensitive to HKI-272 . These findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for cancers harboring the EGFRvIII mutation .
