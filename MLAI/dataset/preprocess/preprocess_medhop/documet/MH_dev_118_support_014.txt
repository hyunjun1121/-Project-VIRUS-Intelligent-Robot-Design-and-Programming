[ Response to antitumor agents of human transplantable glioma implanted into chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo ] . In case of chemotherapy against brain tumors , it is most important to choose suitable drugs for brain tumors , since human tumors have different drug sensitivity and growth . Heretofore , the nitrosourea-induced rat glioma cell , such as P13671 , or immunodeficient mice were usually used for predicting the drug sensitivity of brain tumors . We took notice of Murphy 's system for the chemosensitivity test , in which a human tumor is transplanted into the chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) of a chick embryo . By modifying the conventional Murphy 's system , we studied the efficiency of this system in predicting the drug sensitivity of brain tumors . First , we compared the result of a drug sensitivity test using P62158 of a chick embryo with that using nude mice . Next we studied the effect of chemotherapeutic agents against brain metastasis of a chick embryo caused by the intravenous injection of mouse B16 melanoma cells . The tumor reduction rate of the sensitivity test using a chick embryo tended to agree with that using nude mice . In the drug sensitivity test against brain metastasis , ACNU was the most effective . This result supports the result of the clinical study . In conclusion , the drug sensitivity test using a chick embryo is thought to be useful and the advantages or disadvantages of this system are discussed .
