Selective use of multiple vitamin D response elements underlies the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated negative regulation of the human O15528 gene . The human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00146 ) 1alpha-hydroxylase , which is encoded by the O15528 gene , catalyzes the metabolic activation of the DB00146 into 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) , the most biologically potent vitamin D3 metabolite . The most important regulator of O15528 gene activity is DB00136 itself , which down-regulates the gene . The down-regulation of the O15528 gene has been proposed to involve a negative vitamin D response element ( nVDRE ) that is located approximately 500 bp upstream from transcription start site ( TSS ) . In this study , we reveal the existence of two new P11473 -binding regions in the distal promoter , 2.6 and 3.2 kb upstream from the TSS , that bind vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor complexes . Since the down regulation of the O15528 gene is tissue- and cell-type selective , a comparative study was done for the new DB00136 -responsive regions in P29320 -293 human embryonic kidney and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that reflect tissues that , respectively , are permissive and non-permissive to the phenomenon of DB00136 -mediated down-regulation of this gene . We found significant differences in the composition of protein complexes associated with these O15528 promoter regions in the different cell lines , some of which reflect the capability of transcriptional repression of the O15528 gene in these different cells . In addition , chromatin architecture differed with respect to chromatin looping in the two cell lines , as the new distal regions were differentially connected with the proximal promoter . This data explains , in part , why the human O15528 gene is repressed in P29320 -293 but not in MCF-7 cells .
