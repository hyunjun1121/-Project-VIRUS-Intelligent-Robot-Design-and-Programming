[ DB00162 transport into the cell nucleus in vitro ] . The retinol interaction with intact cellular nuclei , nuclear envelope and chromatin was investigated . We have shown that the Cellular DB00162 -Binding Protein ( P09455 ) plays a very important role in such interaction . DB00162 can specifically interacts with nuclei , nuclear envelope and chromatin only when it presents as a complex with P09455 . The obtained data allowed us to suggest that the process of retinol delivery to hypothetical nuclear receptors include of at least the following stages : 1 ) specific binding with nuclear envelope ; 2 ) penetration into nuclei ; 3 ) specific binding with chromatin receptors . P09455 is a necessary component at all this stages . Also we show that P09455 has not a species or tissue specificity .
