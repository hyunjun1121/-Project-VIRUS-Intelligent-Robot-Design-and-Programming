Lipocalin 2 is required for P11274 - P00519 -induced tumorigenesis . Our previous studies indicate that reduction of lipocalin 2 ( mouse 24p3 ) expression by either anti-sense or siRNA approaches strongly reduces the overgrowth of P11274 - P00519 + mouse myeloid 32D in marrow and spleen of NOD/SCID mice . In this study , we used the mouse bone marrow transplant model to further explore the role of 24p3 in P11274 - P00519 -induced leukemia . Consistent with our previous findings , when using non-irradiated mice as recipient , donor marrow cells expressing P11274 - P00519 but lacking 24p3 did not cause leukemia or any disease after 75 days , whereas all mice receiving wild type P11274 - P00519 donor cells died with CML-like disease . An agar clone of the P11274 - P00519 + human CML cell line K562 ( P01031 ) that secretes relatively high levels of lipocalin 2 ( human P80188 ) induced suppression of hematopoiesis in spleen and marrow of mice , leading to early death in contrast to parental K562 or K562 clone ( P13671 ) expressing low amounts of P80188 . Compared with K562 cells , overexpressing P80188 in K562 led to a higher apoptosis rate and an atrophy phenotype in the spleen of the inoculated mice . Plasma from both leukemic mice and CML patients showed elevated lipocalin 2 levels compared with healthy individuals . Moreover , we found that a primary stable cell line from wild-type mouse marrow cells expressing P11274 - P00519 caused solid tumors in nude mice whereas a similar P11274 - P00519 + cell line from 24p3 null mice did not . These findings demonstrate that lipocalin 2 has at least two functions related to tumorigenesis , one involving apoptosis induction of normal hematopoietic cells and the other being tissue invasion by leukemia cells .
