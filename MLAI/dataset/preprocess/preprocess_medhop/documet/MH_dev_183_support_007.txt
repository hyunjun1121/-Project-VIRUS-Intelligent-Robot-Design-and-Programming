DB02424 attenuates 3‑nitropropionic acid‑induced apoptosis and JNK activation through the expression of HSP 70 in striatal cells . Although selective striatal cell death is a characteristic hallmark in the pathogenesis of Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , the underlying mechanism of striatal susceptibility remains to be clarified . Heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) have been reported to suppress the aggregate formation of mutant huntingtin and concurrent striatal cell death . In a previous study , we observed that heat shock transcription factor 1 ( Q00613 ) , a major transcription factor of HSPs , significantly attenuated 3‑nitropropionic acid (3NP)‑induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and apoptosis through the expression of HSP 70 in striatal cells . To investigate the differential roles of HSPs in 3NP‑induced striatal cell death , the effect of geldanamycin ( GA ) , an P08238 inhibitor , was examined in 3NP‑stimulated striatal cells . GA significantly attenuated 3NP‑induced striatal apoptosis and ROS production with an increased expression of HSP 70 . Triptolide ( TL ) , an HSP 70 inhibitor , abolished GA‑mediated protective effects in 3NP‑stimulated striatal cells . To understand the underlying mechanism by which GA‑mediated HSP 70 protects striatal cells against 3NP stimulation , the involvement of various signaling pathways was examined . GA significantly attenuated 3NP‑induced c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase ( JNK ) phosphorylation and subsequent c‑Jun phosphorylation in striatal cells . Taken together , the present study demonstrated that GA exhibits protective properties against 3NP‑induced apoptosis and JNK activation via the induction of HSP 70 in striatal cells , suggesting that expression of HSP 70 may be a valuable therapeutic target in the treatment of HD .
