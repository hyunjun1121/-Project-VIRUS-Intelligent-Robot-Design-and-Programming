P06401 modulator DB05366 down-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor , adrenomedullin and their receptors and modulates progesterone receptor content in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells . BACKGROUND : This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of graded concentrations ( 10(-8) , 10(-7) and 10(-6) M ) of progesterone receptor ( PR ) modulator DB05366 on the protein contents of PR , of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , adrenomedullin ( P35318 ) and their receptors in cultured human uterine leiomyoma and matching myometrial cells . METHODS : PR-A , PR-B , P15692 , P49765 , P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , P35968 , P35318 and P35318 receptor ( O15218 ) contents were assessed by Western blot analysis . RESULTS : Treatment with 100 ng/ml progesterone increased P15692 , P49765 and P35318 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells . The concomitant treatment with 10(-6) M DB05366 significantly decreased the progesterone-induced P15692 , P49765 and P35318 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells . DB05366 treatment alone decreased P17948 , P35968 and O15218 contents in cultured leiomyoma cells but not in normal myometrial cells . DB05366 treatment increased PR-A and decreased PR-B contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated cultures , whereas no significant changes in PR isoform contents were observed in normal myometrial cells . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that DB05366 down-regulates P15692 , P35318 and their receptor contents and modulates PR isoform contents in cultured leiomyoma cells in a cell-type-specific manner .
