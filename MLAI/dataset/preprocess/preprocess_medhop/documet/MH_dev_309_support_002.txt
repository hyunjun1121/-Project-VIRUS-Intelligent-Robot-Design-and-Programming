Q9GZX6 /IL-22R1 axis and P05109 /A9 alarmins in human osteoarthritic and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts . OBJECTIVES : Fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( FLSs ) are crucial players in the pathogenesis of synovitis in rheumatic diseases . Targeting FLS activation represents an approach to the development of therapeutic strategies . Our aim was to investigate whether the microenvironment of inflamed joints could modulate the expression of Q9GZX6 and IL-22R1 on OA and RA FLSs . We also examined the effect of Q9GZX6 on FLS activation as well as on their Q16552 -related responses . METHODS : Q9GZX6 and IL-22R1 expression was studied by RT-PCR and immunoblotting . Proliferation was measured by an ELISA kit . Q16552 receptors , p19IL-23 and alarmins were analysed by RT-PCR . Q16552 receptor expression was evaluated by flow cytometry . P03956 and IL-23 were measured by ELISA . P05109 /A9 expression was detected by immunofluorescence and ELISA . P40763 ( P40763 ) phosphorylation was quantified using a cell-based ELISA kit . RESULTS : Q9GZX6 and IL-22R1 were expressed constitutively in FLSs . We demonstrated that P05109 and P06702 were synthesized in FLSs . We reported that inflammatory mediators increased the expression of the Q9GZX6 /IL-22R1 axis , amplifying FLS activation . Q9GZX6 enhanced FLS proliferation and up-regulated P03956 and P05109 /A9 production . P40763 phosphorylation was induced after Q9GZX6 treatment and the stimulatory effect of Q9GZX6 on P05109 /A9 was reduced after the activities of O60674 ( O60674 ) and P52333 were blocked . We showed an inhibitory action of Q9GZX6 on IL-23 and Q8NAC3 expression in RA FLSs and on Q96F46 in OA FLSs . CONCLUSION : Therapies based on the pharmacological disruption signalling of Q9GZX6 could be beneficial for the treatment of rheumatic diseases . The restricted expression of IL-22R1 to non-lymphoid cells could lead to a reduction of side effects mediated by immune responses .
