Attenuation of fever at near term : is interleukin-6- P40763 signalling altered ? Pregnant rats in late gestation show a reduced fever response after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . This can result from either an increased action of endogenous antipyretics or a reduction in the production or action of endogenous pyrogens . Nonpregnant rats given LPS release interleukin ( IL ) -6 , which causes nuclear translocation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) in the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis ( OVLT ) , followed by a significant increase in core body temperature . The present study investigated whether the reduced fever response in near-term pregnant rats is associated with a reduced nuclear P40763 response . Rats at gestation day 15 ( Q99943 ) , gestation day 21 ( Q96NT5 , near term ) and at lactation day 5 ( Q15004 ) were injected with LPS ( 50 microg/kg , i.p. ) or vehicle . Only near-term pregnant rats responded with an attenuated body temperature during the fever response . Immunohistological analysis indicated no significant difference in nuclear P40763 in the OVLT of the different animal groups 2 h after LPS . Measurement of total and phosphorylated P40763 protein in the OVLT with semiquantitative western blot revealed no significant differences of this protein among these immune challenged animal groups . P05231 concentrations were also similar at Q99943 , Q96NT5 and Q15004 2 h after injection of LPS . These results lead to the conclusion that the attenuation of the fever response at near-term pregnancy is not associated with a reduced amount of nuclear P40763 in the OVLT , indicating a maintained P05231 - P40763 signalling pathway in the OVLT .
