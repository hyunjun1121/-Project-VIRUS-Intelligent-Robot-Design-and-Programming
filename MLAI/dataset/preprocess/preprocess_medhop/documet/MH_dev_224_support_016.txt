Development of a novel , fully-automated genotyping system : principle and applications . Genetic testing prior to treatment , pharmacogenetic analysis , is key to realizing personalized medicine which is a topic that has attracted much attention recently . Through the optimization of therapy selection and dosage , a reduction in side effects is expected . Genetic testing has been conducted as a type of pharmacogenetic analysis in recent years , but it faces challenges in terms of cost effectiveness and its complicated procedures . Here we report on the development of a novel platform for genetic testing , the i-densy™ , with the use of quenching probe system ( QP-system ) as principle of mutant detection . The i-densy™ automatically performs pre-treatment , PCR and detection to provide the test result from whole blood and extracted DNA within approximately 90 and 60 min , respectively . Integration of all steps into a single platform greatly reduces test time and complicated procedures . An even higher-precision genetic analysis has been achieved through the development of novel and highly-specific detection methods . The applications of items measured using the i-densy™ are diverse , from single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , such as P33261 and P22309 , to somatic mutations associated with cancer , such as P00533 , P01116 and O60674 . The i-densy™ is a useful tool for optimization of anticancer drug therapy and can contribute to personalized medicine .
