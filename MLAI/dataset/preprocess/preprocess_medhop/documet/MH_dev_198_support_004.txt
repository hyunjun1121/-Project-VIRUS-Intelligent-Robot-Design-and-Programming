Inhibition of brain prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 prevents the preparturient increase in fetal adrenocorticotropin secretion in the sheep fetus . Maturation of the fetal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is critical for the timely somatic development of the fetus and readiness for birth . Recently , we proposed that prostaglandin generation within the fetal central nervous system is critical for the modulation of hypotension-induced fetal DB01285 secretion . The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the preparturient increase in fetal DB01285 secretion is dependent upon fetal central nervous system prostaglandin synthesis mediated by the activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ( PGHS ) -2 ( cyclooxygenase-2 ) in the fetal brain . We performed two studies in chronically catheterized fetal sheep . In the first study , we infused nimesulide or vehicle intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v ) into singleton fetal sheep and collected blood samples until spontaneous parturition . DB04743 significantly delayed parturition , and inhibited fetal DB01285 and proopiomelanocortin secretion but did not prevent the preparturient increase in fetal plasma cortisol concentration . In the second study , we used twin fetuses . One fetus received intracerebroventricular nimesulide and the other intracerebroventricular vehicle . DB04743 reduced brain tissue concentrations of prostaglandin estradiol , while not affecting plasma prostaglandin E(2) concentrations , demonstrating an action restricted to the fetal brain . DB04743 reduced P35354 mRNA and increased P35354 protein , while not altering P23219 mRNA or protein in most brain regions , suggesting an effect of the inhibitor on P35354 turnover and relative specificity for P35354 in vivo . We conclude that the preparturient increase in fetal DB01285 and proopiomelanocortin is dependent upon the activity of P35354 in the fetal brain . However , we also conclude that the timing of parturition is not solely dependent upon DB01285 in this species .
