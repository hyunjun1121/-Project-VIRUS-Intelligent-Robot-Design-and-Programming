DB00065 can induce a prolonged clinical remission and a decrease in thyroid hormonal requirements in a patient with SAPHO syndrome and hypothyroidism . SAPHO syndrome is a rare entity that compromises the skeletal system ( arthritis-osteitis ) and is associated with various dermatological conditions such as palmoplantaris pustulosis ( PPP ) and acne . We present the case of a 39-year-old man with invalidating arthritis derived from a SAPHO syndrome and hypothyroidism ( after radioiodine treatment for a Graves ' disease ) . Due to the severity and refractoriness of his disease , we decided to use infliximab . He showed a prompt and prolonged response of his joint and cutaneous manifestations after three doses of a tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) blocker . Interestingly , he also decreased his levothyroxine requirements after P01375 blockade therapy .
