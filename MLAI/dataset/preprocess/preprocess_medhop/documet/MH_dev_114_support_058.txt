A new role for the P40763 inhibitor , Q9Y6X2 : a repressor of microphthalmia transcription factor . In vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that microphthalmia transcription factor ( O75030 ) plays a key regulatory role in tissue-specific gene regulation in several cell types , including melanocytes , osteoclasts , and mast cells . A yeast two-hybrid search , using a portion of a nonmutated O75030 gene as the bait in the screening of a mast cell library , resulted in the isolation of the P40763 inhibitor , Q9Y6X2 . Q9Y6X2 is a transcriptional inhibitor that acts by specifically inhibiting P40763 's DNA binding activity . We found that it can directly associate with O75030 using an in vitro pull-down assay . Immunoprecipitation of O75030 from rat basophilic leukemic cells or mouse melanocytes resulted in the specific co-immunoprecipitation of Q9Y6X2 . Co-transfection of O75030 with Q9Y6X2 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts containing an mMCP-6 promoter-luciferase reporter demonstrated up to 94 % inhibition of O75030 -mediated transcriptional activation . Using a gel-shift assay , it was shown that Q9Y6X2 can block DNA binding activity . It was also found that P40763 does not interfere , either in vitro or in vivo , with the interaction between Q9Y6X2 and O75030 . These data suggest that Q9Y6X2 functions in vivo as a key molecule in supressing the transcriptional activity of O75030 , a role of considerable importance in mast cell and melanocyte development .
