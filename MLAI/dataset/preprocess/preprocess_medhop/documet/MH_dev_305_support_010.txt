Mammographic density and candidate gene variants : a twins and sisters study . BACKGROUND : Mammographic density , the light/white radiographic appearance on a mammogram that represents connective and epithelial tissue , is a strong risk factor for breast cancer which seems to be highly heritable . Little is known about its genetic determinants . METHODS : We studied 457 women from 207 sisterhoods ( 104 monozygotic twins , 182 dizygotic twins , and 171 singletons ) . Percentage mammographic density ( PMD ) as well as dense area and nondense area were calculated using a computer-assisted method . We measured six single nucleotide polymorphisms from six candidate genes ( P21964 , P14060 , P17936 , P04626 , P18074 , and O43542 ) . Associations between genotypes and mammographic measures were tested ( a ) cross-sectionally using a multivariate normal model fitted using FISHER that allowed separate correlations for monozygotic , dizygotic , and nontwin pairs and ( b ) within sister pairs using paired t tests . RESULTS : Cross-sectionally , each additional copy of the P14060 DB00174 (367) DB00156 variant allele was associated with lower PMD ( -3.47 % per allele ; SE = 1.65 ; P = 0.035 ) . Within-pair regression estimates confirmed this association . There was no evidence for an association between the mammographic density measures and any of the other variants studied . CONCLUSION : We have replicated an association between a variant in the P14060 gene and PMD , which suggests that P14060 may be genetic determinant of mammographic density .
