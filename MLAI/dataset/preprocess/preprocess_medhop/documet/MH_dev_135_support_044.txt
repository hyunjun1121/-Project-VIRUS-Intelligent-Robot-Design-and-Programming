Neuroprotective gene expression profiles in ischemic cortical cultures preconditioned with DB01277 or P09038 . The mechanisms underlying growth factor preconditioning of neurons are only partially elucidated , and no studies have been conducted in this area using a gene profiling approach . We used cDNA microarrays to compare the transcriptional profiles of cells preconditioned either with insulin-like growth factor I ( DB01277 ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , to identify differentially regulated genes that may function in growth factor signaling , response to oxygen-glucose deprivation ( OGD ) , and most importantly , cell survival . Primary rat cortical cultures were treated with P09038 or DB01277 for 2 , 24 , or 24 h followed by OGD for 90 min , and compared with cells that were subject to OGD without growth factor pretreatment . Although the majority of surveyed genes were unchanged in all experimental treatments , 175 genes ( 10 % of the cDNAs on the chip ) were found to be differentially regulated in at least one of the treatment conditions . Hierarchical clustering of these 175 genes was used to identify four expression clusters : DB01277 regulated , P09038 regulated , OGD regulated , and putative neuroprotective genes . Further analysis using realtime RT-PCR confirmed that we had identified genes that are regulated by single growth factors , as well as several more that are co-regulated by both DB01277 and P09038 . These genes can influence neuronal survival by affecting diverse pathways such as growth factor signal transduction ( P16070 , Q99075 , Q16828 , Q12929 , P17936 ) , DNA repair and transcription ( Q92949 ) , metabolic homeostasis ( P20936 , P34897 ) , cytoskeletal stability ( P26038 , P10636 ) and cholesterol biosynthesis ( P37268 , P14324 ) .
