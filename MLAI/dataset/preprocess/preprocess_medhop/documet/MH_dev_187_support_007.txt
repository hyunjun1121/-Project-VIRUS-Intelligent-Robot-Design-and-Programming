Effects of DB09045 on Thyroid C Cells and Serum P01258 in Male Monkeys . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptor agonists , used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , have caused hyperplasia/neoplasia of thyroid C cells in rodent carcinogenicity studies . Studies in monkeys have not identified an effect of P43220 agonists on thyroid C cells ; however , group sizes were small . DB09045 is a once-weekly , long-acting human P43220 agonist recently approved in the United States and the European Union . The objective of this study was to determine whether dulaglutide altered C-cell mass in monkeys . Male cynomolgus monkeys ( 20 per group ) were sc injected with dulaglutide 8.15 mg/kg ( ∼500-fold maximum human plasma exposure ) or a vehicle control twice weekly for 52 weeks . Basal and calcium gluconate-stimulated serum calcitonin concentrations were obtained at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months . Thyroid glands were weighed , fixed , and sectioned at 500-μm intervals . C-cell volumes were measured using an automated image analysis . C-cell proliferation was estimated using Ki67/calcitonin colabeling and cell counting . Administration of dulaglutide 8.15 mg/kg twice weekly for 52 weeks did not increase serum calcitonin in monkeys or affect thyroid weight , histology , C-cell proliferation , or absolute/relative C-cell volume . This study represents a comprehensive evaluation of the monkey thyroid C cells after dosing with a P43220 agonist , with a large group size , and measurement of multiple relevant parameters . The lack of effect of dulaglutide on C cells is consistent with other studies in monkeys using P43220 agonists and suggests that nonhuman primates are less sensitive than rodents to the induction of proliferative changes in thyroid C cells by P43220 agonists .
