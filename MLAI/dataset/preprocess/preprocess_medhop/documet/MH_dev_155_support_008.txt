The combination of rapamycin and MAPK inhibitors enhances the growth inhibitory effect on Nara-H cells . The inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) signaling pathway promotes the initiation of autophagy , and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) /extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( P29323 ) is well known to induce autophagy . Autophagy is a self-defense mechanism of cancer cells that are subjected to antitumor agents , and blocking autophagy can trigger apoptosis . In the present study , we demonstrate that an P42345 inhibitor , rapamycin , induces autophagy in the Nara-H malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( Q9H334 ) cell line through the activation of P27361 /2 . DB00877 -induced apoptosis was enhanced following the inhibition of the MEK/ P29323 pathway . In the Nara-H cells , we examined the effects of rapamycin treatment on cell proliferation and on the phosphorylation of the P42345 pathway components and autophagy by western blot analysis . Furthermore , we examined the effects of rapamycin with or without the MEK inhibitor , U0126 , on the induction of apoptosis by using fluorescence microscopy . DB00877 inhibited Nara-H cell proliferation and decreased the phosphorylation of the P42345 pathway in the Nara-H cells . DB00877 induced the apoptosis of Nara-H cells , and this apoptosis was enhanced by U0126 . Simultaneously , phospho- P27361 /2 was activated by rapamycin . The present study demonstrates that rapamycin induces autophagy in Nara-H cells by activating the MEK/ P29323 signaling pathway , and the rapamycin-induced apoptosis can be enhanced by the MEK inhibitor , U0126 . These results suggest that selfâ€‘protective mechanisms involving P42345 inhibitors in Nara-H cells are prevented by the inhibition of the MEK/ P29323 pathway . The combination of an P42345 inhibitor ( e.g. , rapamycin ) and an MEK inhibitor ( e.g. , U0126 ) may offer effective treatment for Q9H334 , as this combination effectively activates apoptotic pathways .
