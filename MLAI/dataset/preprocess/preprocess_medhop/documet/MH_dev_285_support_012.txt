DB09045 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . DB09045 is a novel glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptor agonist with a unique structure that supports once-weekly dosing in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , most of whom have a big pill burden . It appears to be efficacious in reducing hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) up to 1.59 % and promotes modest weight loss up to 3 kg with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events . Convenient weekly dosing could improve compliance and help attain sustained glycemic goals . Addressing obesity is an integral part of T2DM management and weight loss may contribute to better glycemic and cardiovascular benefits . Results of ongoing clinical trials on cardiovascular safety are important to determine the risk-to-benefit ratio . As with any drug , patient selection and ongoing monitoring will be important . If approved , dulaglutide will be one of the first weekly P43220 agonist to be available in a ready-to-use pen device with an automatic injector .
