Modulation of cyclin D1 expression in human tumoral parathyroid cells : effects of growth factors and calcium sensing receptor activation . The study investigated cyclin D1 regulation by growth factors and calcium sensing receptor ( P41180 ) in human tumoral parathyroid cells . Basic fibroblast and epidermal growth factors increased cyclin D1 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( pERK1/2 ) levels that were both efficiently inhibited by P41180 agonists . By contrast , in growth factors-free medium cyclin D1 levels were either unaffected or stimulated by P41180 activation independently from P27361 /2 pathway . Transforming growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) reduced cyclin D1 levels in the majority of tumors , this effect being not influenced by P41180 activation and menin expression levels . In conclusion , in parathyroid tumors cyclin D1 expression was modulated by growth factors and P41180 activation . These data further support the oncogenic role of cyclin D1 , which resulted to be target for stimulation by P09038 and P01133 and inhibition by P41180 and TGFbeta signalling in the parathyroid .
