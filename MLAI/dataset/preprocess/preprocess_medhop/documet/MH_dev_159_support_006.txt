Splenic autonomic denervation increases inflammatory status but does not aggravate atherosclerotic lesion development . The brain plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammation . Immune cells are under control of the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex , mainly acting via autonomic innervation of the spleen . Activation of this reflex inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and may reduce the development of atherosclerosis . Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of selective parasympathetic ( Px ) and sympathetic ( Sx ) denervation of the spleen on inflammatory status and atherosclerotic lesion development . Female P02649 *3-Leiden. P11597 mice , a well-established model for human-like lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis , were fed a cholesterol-containing Western-type diet for 4 wk after which they were subdivided into three groups receiving either splenic Px , splenic Sx , or sham surgery . The mice were subsequently challenged with the same diet for an additional 15 wk . Selective Px increased leukocyte counts ( i.e. , dendritic cells , B cells , and T cells ) in the spleen and increased gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the liver and peritoneal leukocytes compared with Sx and sham surgery . Both Px and Sx increased circulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and P05231 . However , the increased proinflammatory status in denervated mice did not affect atherosclerotic lesion size or lesion composition . CONCLUSION : Predominantly selective Px of the spleen enhances the inflammatory status , which , however , does not aggravate diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion development .
