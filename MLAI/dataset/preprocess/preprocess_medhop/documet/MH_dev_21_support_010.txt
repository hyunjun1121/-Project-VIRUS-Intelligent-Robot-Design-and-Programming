DB00013 plasminogen activator augments cell proliferation and neointima formation in injured arteries via proteolytic mechanisms . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) has been implicated in the healing responses of injured arteries , but the importance of its various properties that influence smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) proliferation and migration in vivo is unclear . We used three recombinant ( r- ) forms of uPA , which differ markedly in their proteolytic activities and abilities to bind to the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) , to determine , which property most influences the healing responses of balloon catheter injured rat carotid arteries . After injury , uPA and Q03405 expression increased markedly throughout the period when medial SMCs were rapidly proliferating and migrating to form the neointima . Perivascular application of uPA neutralizing antibodies immediately after injury attenuated the healing response , significantly reducing neointima size and neointimal SMC numbers . Perivascular application of r-uPAwt ( wild type uPA ) or r-uPA/GDF ( r-uPA with multiple mutations in its growth factor-like domain ) doubled the size of the neointima . Four days after injury these two uPAs nearly doubled neointimal and medial SMC numbers in the vessels , and induced greater reductions in lumen size than injury alone . Proteolytically inactive r-uPA/H/Q ( containing glutamine rather than histidine-204 in its catalytic site ) did not affect neointima or lumen size . Also , in contrast to the actions of proteolytically active uPAs , tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) did not affect the rate of neointima development . We conclude that uPA is an important factor regulating the healing responses of balloon catheter injured arteries , and its proteolytic property , which can not be mimicked by tPA , greatly influences SMC proliferation and early neointima formation .
