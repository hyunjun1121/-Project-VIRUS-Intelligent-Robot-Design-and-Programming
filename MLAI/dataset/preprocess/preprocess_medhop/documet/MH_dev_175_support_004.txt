Current status of antibody therapy in ALL . Despite the significant advances in modern chemotherapy , it remains challenging to treat adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) . The relapse rate remains high , and the outcome at the time of relapse is dismal . Antibody-based therapies have demonstrated promising results in this patient group . Variable mechanisms have been applied to target surface antigens ( P11836 [ also termed P11836 ] , P20273 , P31358 and P15391 ) that are commonly expressed on malignant leukaemia cells . In this review , we will focus on the clinical application of such therapies in adult ALL , including the naked antibodies : DB00073 , Ofatumumab , DB04958 and DB00087 ; the immunotoxins : BL22 and Combotox ; the immunoconjugates : inotuzumab and SAR 3419 ; as well as the Bi-specific T cell engaging ( BiTE ) -specific antibody , DB09052 .
