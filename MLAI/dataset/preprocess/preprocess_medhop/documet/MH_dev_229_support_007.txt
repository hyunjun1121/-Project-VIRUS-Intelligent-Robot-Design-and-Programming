P05231 ( P05231 ) and/or soluble P05231 receptor down-regulation of human type II collagen gene expression in articular chondrocytes requires a decrease of Sp1.Sp3 ratio and of the binding activity of both factors to the P02458 promoter . Type II collagen is composed of alpha1(II) chains encoded by the P02458 gene . Alteration of this cartilage marker is a common feature of osteoarthritis . P05231 ( P05231 ) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that needs a soluble form of receptor called sIL-6R to exert its effects in some cellular models . In that case , sIL-6R exerts agonistic action . This mechanism can make up for the partial or total absence of membrane-anchored P05231 receptors in some cell types , such as chondrocytes . Our study shows that P05231 , sIL-6R , or both inhibit type II collagen production by rabbit articular chondrocytes through a transcriptional control . The cytokine and/or sIL-6R repress P02458 transcription by a -63/-35 sequence that binds Sp1.Sp3 . Indeed , P05231 and/or sIL-6R inhibit Sp1 and Sp3 expression and their binding activity to the 63-bp promoter . In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments , P05231 .sIL-6R induced an increase in Sp3 recruitment to the detriment of Sp1 . Knockdown of Sp1.Sp3 by small interference RNA and decoy strategies were found to prevent the P05231 - and/or sIL-6R-induced inhibition of P02458 transcription , indicating that each of these Sp proteins is required for down-regulation of the target gene and that a heterotypic Sp1.Sp3 complex is involved . Additionally , Sp1 was shown to interact with Sp3 and Q13547 . Indeed , overexpression of a full-length Sp3 cDNA blocked the Sp1 up-regulation of the 63-bp P02458 promoter activity , and by itself , inhibits P02458 transcription . We can conclude that P05231 , sIL-6R , or both in combination decrease both the Sp1.Sp3 ratio and DNA-binding activities , thus inhibiting P02458 transcription .
