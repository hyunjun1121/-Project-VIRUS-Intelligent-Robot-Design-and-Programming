LC-MS based assay to measure intracellular compound levels in Mycobacterium smegmatis : linking compound levels to cellular potency . P00374 ( P00374 ) plays a central role in maintaining cellular pool of tetrahydrofolic acid , a cofactor necessary for DNA , RNA and protein synthesis . The clinical validation of P00374 as antibacterial target was established by the success of trimethoprim ( P54849 ) . P00374 is also an attractive target for identifying anti-tuberculosis molecules however , due to observed weak cellular potency , no P00374 inhibitors have been developed as drugs so far . P54849 and its analogs have poor cellular potency on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis cells . We found a mutant strain of M. smegmatis , mc²155 to be sensitive to P54849 whereas wild type strain was not inhibited by P54849 . We utilized this system to probe if poor or lack of activity of P54849 is a consequence of poor intracellular compound levels . An LC-MS based method was developed for measuring P54849 and rifampicin ( Q9HBH0 ) in M. smegmatis . Using the assay , equivalent Q9HBH0 levels were observed in both strains however , P54849 was detected only in mc²155 cells , hence proving a positive correlation between potency and compound levels . To the best of our knowledge this is the first time LC-MS method has been used to measure compound levels in mycobacterial cells . We propose it to be a valuable tool to understand the lack of potency or resistance mechanisms in antimycobacterial drug development .
