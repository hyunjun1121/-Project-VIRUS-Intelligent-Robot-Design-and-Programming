GABA(A) receptor pi ( O00591 ) stimulates basal-like breast cancer cell migration through activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of distinct subtypes predictive of patient outcome . Tumors of the basal-like subtype have a poor prognosis due to inherent aggressiveness and the lack of targeted therapeutics . Basal-like tumors typically lack estrogen receptor-Î± , progesterone receptor and P04626 / P04626 , or in other words they are triple negative ( TN ) . Continued evaluation of basal-like breast cancer ( BLBC ) biology is essential to identify novel therapeutic targets . Expression of the pi subunit of the GABA(A) receptor ( O00591 ) is associated with the BLBC/TN subtype , and herein , we reveal its expression also correlates with metastases to the brain and poorer patient outcome . O00591 expression in breast cancer cell lines also demonstrates a significant correlation with the basal-like subtype suggesting that O00591 functions in the initiation and/or progression of basal-like tumors . To address this postulate , we stably silenced O00591 in two BLBC cell lines , HCC1187 and HCC70 cells . Decreased O00591 reduces in vitro tumorigenic potential and migration concurrent with alterations in the cytoskeleton , specifically diminished cellular protrusions and expression of the BLBC-associated cytokeratins , P13647 , P04259 , P02533 , and Q04695 . Silencing O00591 also decreases phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) in both cell lines and selective inhibition of P27361 /2 similarly decreases the basal-like cytokeratins as well as migration . Combined , these data reveal a O00591 - P27361 /2-cytokeratin axis that maintains the migratory phenotype of basal-like breast cancer . O00591 is a component of a cell surface receptor , thus , these findings suggest that targeting this new signaling axis may have therapeutic potential in BLBC .
