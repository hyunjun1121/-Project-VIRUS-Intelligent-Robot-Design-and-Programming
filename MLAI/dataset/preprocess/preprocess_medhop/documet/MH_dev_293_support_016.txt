Point mutation of the proteasome beta5 subunit gene is an important mechanism of bortezomib resistance in bortezomib-selected variants of Jurkat T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia line . To study the mechanism of acquired resistance to bortezomib , a new antitumor drug that is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor , we established a series of bortezomib-resistant T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia cell lines , designated the JurkatBs , from the parental Jurkat line via repeated drug selection . There were no significant differences in the growth curves or colony formation between the JurkatB cells and parental Jurkat cells . The effects of bortezomib on cytotoxicity , cell cycle arrest , and induction of apoptosis were decreased in JurkatB cells compared with parental Jurkat cells . A mutation in the proteasome beta5 subunit ( P28074 ) gene ( G322A ) , which encodes an amino acid change from Ala to DB00156 at polypeptide position 108 , was detected by sequencing full-length cDNA clones and direct polymerase chain reaction products of the P28074 gene . DB00188 caused less inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity in resistant cells . When the G322A mutant P28074 was retrovirally introduced into parental Jurkat cells , it conferred bortezomib resistance to these cells , resulting in decreased cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity . The predicted structure of A108T-mutated P28074 shows a conformational change that suggests decreased affinity to bortezomib . In short , the G322A mutation of the P28074 gene is a novel mechanism for bortezomib resistance .
