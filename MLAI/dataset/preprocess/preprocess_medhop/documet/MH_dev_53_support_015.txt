DB08889 can induce tumor cell death through selective inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome . DB08889 is a proteasome inhibitor in clinical development that primarily targets the chymotrypsin-like ( CT-L ) subunits in both the constitutive proteasome ( c20S ) and the immunoproteasome ( i20S ) . To investigate the impact of inhibiting the CT-L activity with carfilzomib , we set out to quantitate the levels of CT-L subunits beta5 from the c20S and P28062 from the i20S in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells . We found that the i20S is a major form of the proteasome expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin , including multiple myeloma ( MM ) CD138+ tumor cells . Although specific inhibition of either P28062 or beta5 alone was insufficient to produce an antitumor response , inhibition of all proteasome subunits was cytotoxic to both hematologic tumor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells . However , selective inhibition of both beta5 and P28062 was sufficient to induce an antitumor effect in MM , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and leukemia cells while minimizing the toxicity toward nontransformed cells . In MM tumor cells , CT-L inhibition alone was sufficient to induce proapoptotic sequelae , including proteasome substrate accumulation , Noxa and caspase 3/7 induction , and phospho-eIF2alpha suppression . These data support a hypothesis that hematologic tumor cells are uniquely sensitive to CT-L inhibition and provide a mechanistic understanding of the clinical safety profile and antitumor activity of proteasome inhibitors .
