A randomized phase II trial of maintenance therapy with DB00398 in front-line ovarian carcinoma . OBJECTIVES : DB00398 , an oral multikinase inhibitor of the VEGFR/ P09619 /Raf/MEK/ P29323 pathway , has shown potential activity in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer ( OC ) . One strategy to prolong disease control and survival in patients with OC is maintenance therapy after achieving a complete response . A double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with sorafenib in the treatment of OC is presented . METHODS : Patients with epithelial OC or primary peritoneal cancer in complete remission were randomized to sorafenib 400mg P55957 or matching placebo . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) . RESULTS : Of 246 randomized patients , 93 % had OC ; baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms . There was no significant difference between sorafenib and placebo arms for PFS ( median 12.7 vs 15.7 months ; hazard ratio 1.09 ; 95 % CI 0.72-1.63 ) , although there was a notable imbalance in early censoring . The most common â‰¥ grade 3 adverse events ( AEs ) were hand-foot skin reaction ( 39.0 % vs 0.8 % ) and rash ( 14.6 % vs 0 % ) . More patients receiving sorafenib versus placebo required dose reductions ( 67.5 % vs 30.1 % ) , resulting in a lower than planned median daily dose ( median 584.6 vs 800.0mg ) . Treatment with sorafenib was of shorter duration ( median 17.6 vs 51.9 weeks ) with more frequent discontinuations due to AEs ( 37.4 % vs 6.5 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 400mg P55957 can not be recommended as maintenance therapy for patients with OC in complete remission . Assessment of efficacy was limited by the high rate of dose reductions and early discontinuations .
