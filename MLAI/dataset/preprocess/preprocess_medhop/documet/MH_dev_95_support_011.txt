The T11(3) epitope of the P06729 molecule , sheep erythrocytes , and the alternative T-cell activation pathway . In this study , results are presented showing that the T11(3) epitope of the P06729 molecule is expressed on unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells , resting T cells and activated T cells . T11(3) is not therefore , an activation-specific P06729 epitope . Sheep erythrocytes ( P12931 ) which present a cell-surface ligand for P06729 could not effectively replace anti-T11(2) in initiating proliferation of resting T cells , stimulated by anti-T11(3) . P12931 with either of these anti- P06729 monoclonal antibodies did activate resting T cells , but proliferation required the presence of added P60568 .
