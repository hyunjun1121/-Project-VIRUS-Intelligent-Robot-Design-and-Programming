DB01037 transdermal system : in the treatment of major depressive disorder . The monamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor selegiline is selective for P27338 at the low oral dosages used in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease . However , P21397 is also inhibited at the high oral dosages needed to effectively treat depression ( not an approved indication ) , necessitating a tyramine-restricted diet . The selegiline transdermal system was designed to deliver antidepressant drug concentrations to the CNS , without substantially impairing small intestine P21397 activity . At the target dose of 6 mg/24 hours , tyramine dietary restrictions are not needed . Short-term treatment with fixed ( 6 mg/24 hours ) or flexible ( 6 , 9 or 12 mg/24 hours ) doses of selegiline transdermal system was superior to placebo on most measures of antidepressant activity in 6- or 8-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Likewise , long-term treatment with a fixed dose of selegiline transdermal system 6 mg/24 hours was superior to placebo as maintenance therapy in a 52-week , randomised , double-blind , multicentre , relapse-prevention trial in patients with MDD . DB01037 transdermal system therapy was generally well tolerated in placebo-controlled studies ; application site reactions , mostly of mild to moderate severity , were the most commonly reported adverse events . The incidence of sexual adverse effects and weight gain was low and similar to that with placebo .
