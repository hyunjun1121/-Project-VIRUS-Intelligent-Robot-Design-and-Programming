Acute erythropoietin cardioprotection is mediated by endothelial response . Increasing evidence indicates that high levels of serum erythropoietin ( Epo ) can lessen ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart and multiple cardiac cell types have been suggested to play a role in this Epo effect . To clarify the mechanisms underlying this cardioprotection , we explored Epo treatment of coronary artery endothelial cells and Epo cardioprotection in a Mus musculus model with Epo receptor expression restricted to hematopoietic and endothelial cells ( ΔEpoR ) . Epo stimulation of coronary artery endothelial cells upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity in vitro and in vivo , and enhanced nitric oxide ( NO ) production that was determined directly by real-time measurements of gaseous NO release . Epo stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( AKT ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) /extracellular signal regulated kinase ( P29323 ) signaling pathways , and inhibition of PI3K , but not MEK activity , blocked Epo-induced NO production . To verify the potential of this Epo effect in cardioprotection in vivo , ΔEpoR-mice with Epo response in heart restricted to endothelium were treated with Epo . These mice exhibited a similar increase in P29474 phosphorylation in coronary artery endothelium as that found in wild type ( WT ) mice . In addition , in both WT- and ΔEpoR-mice , exogenous Epo treatment prior to myocardial ischemia provided comparable protection . These data provide the first evidence that endothelial cell response to Epo is sufficient to achieve an acute cardioprotective effect . The immediate response of coronary artery endothelial cells to Epo stimulation by NO production may be a critical mechanism underlying this Epo cardioprotection .
