NSA9 , a human prothrombin kringle-2-derived peptide , acts as an inhibitor of kringle-2-induced activation in EOC2 microglia . In neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's , microglial cell activation is thought to contribute to CNS injury by producing neurotoxic compounds . P00734 and kringle-2 increase levels of NO and the mRNA expression of P35228 , IL-1beta , and P01375 in microglial cells . In contrast , the human prothrombin kringle-2 derived peptide NSA9 inhibits NO release and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta , P01375 , and P05231 in LPS-activated EOC2 microglia . In this study , we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of NSA9 in human prothrombin- and kringle-2-stimulated EOC2 microglia . Treatment with 20-100 muM of NSA9 attenuated both prothrombin- and kringle-2-induced microglial activation . NO production induced by MAPKs and NF-kappaB was similarly reduced by inhibitors of P29323 ( PD98059 ) , p38 ( SB203580 ) , NF-kappaB ( DB06151 ) , and NSA9 . These results suggest that NSA9 acts independently as an inhibitor of microglial activation and that its effects in EOC2 microglia are not influenced by the presence of kringle-2 .
