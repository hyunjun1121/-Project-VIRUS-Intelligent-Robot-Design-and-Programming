Synthetic triterpenoid induces P15428 expression and suppresses inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis . Colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) develops as a result of inflammation-induced epithelial transformation , which occurs in response to inflammatory cytokine-dependent downregulation of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( P15428 ) and subsequent suppression of prostaglandin metabolism . Agents that both enhance P15428 expression and suppress cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) production may more effectively prevent CAC . Synthetic triterpenoids are a class of small molecules that suppress P35354 as well as inflammatory cytokine signaling . Here , we found that administration of the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-C28-methyl ester ( CDDO-Me ) suppresses CAC in mice . In a spontaneous , inflammation-driven intestinal neoplasia model , deletion of Q13485 specifically in T cells led to progressive production of inflammatory cytokines , including P01375 -α , IFN-γ , P35228 , P05231 , IL-1β ; as well as activation of P42224 and P40763 ; along with suppression of P15428 expression . Oral administration of CDDO-Me to mice with Q13485 -deficient T cells increased survival and suppressed intestinal epithelial neoplasia by decreasing production of inflammatory mediators and increasing expression of P15428 . Induction of P15428 by CDDO-Me was dose dependent in epithelial cells and was abrogated following treatment with TGF-β signaling inhibitors in vitro . Furthermore , CDDO-Me-dependent P15428 induction was not observed in P84022 -/- mice . Similarly , CDDO-Me suppressed azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulfate-induced carcinogenesis in wild-type animals , highlighting the potential of small molecules of the triterpenoid family as effective agents for the chemoprevention of CAC in humans .
