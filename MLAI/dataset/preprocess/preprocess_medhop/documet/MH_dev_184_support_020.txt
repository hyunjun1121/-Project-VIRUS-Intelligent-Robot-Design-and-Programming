Pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic and clinical profile of novel antiplatelet drugs targeting vascular diseases . Platelet inhibitors are the mainstay treatment for patients with vascular diseases . The current ' gold standard ' antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has several pharmacological and clinical limitations that have prompted the search for more effective platelet antagonists . The candidates include various blockers of the purinergic Q9H244 receptor such as prasugrel , an oral irreversible thienopyridine ; two adenosine triphosphate analogues that bind reversibly to the Q9H244 receptor : ticagrelor ( oral ) and cangrelor ( intravenous ) ; elinogrel , a direct-acting reversible Q9H244 receptor inhibitor ( the only antiplatelet compound that can be administered both intravenously and orally ) ; BX 667 , an orally active and reversible small-molecule Q9H244 receptor antagonist ; P35240 530348 , P35240 205831 , P35240 602539 and E5555 , highly selective and orally active antagonists on the protease-activated receptor 1 . A number of drugs also hit new targets : terutroban , an oral , selective and specific inhibitor of the thromboxane receptor ; DB05202 , a second-generation , nuclease resistant aptamer which inhibits P04275 -dependent platelet aggregation ; Q96JZ2 -0081 , a bivalent humanized nanobody targeting the GPIb binding site of P04275 and AJW200 , an IgG4 monoclonal antibody of P04275 . The pharmacology and clinical profiles of new platelet antagonists indicate that they provide more consistent , more rapid and more potent platelet inhibition than agents currently used . Whether these potential advantages will translate into clinical advantages will require additional comparisons in properly powered , randomized , controlled trials .
