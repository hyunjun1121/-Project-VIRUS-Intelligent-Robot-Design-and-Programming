DB01270 in the treatment of patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema . Diabetic macular edema is the major cause of visual acuity impairment in diabetic patients . The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown and , currently , grid/focal retinal laser photocoagulation represents the recommended treatment . It has been demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema by mediating vascular permeability and accumulation of intracellular and extracellular fluid , and thereby represents an appealing candidate as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic macular edema . The advent of intravitreal anti- P15692 drugs has opened up a new era for the management of diabetic macular edema . At present , three anti- P15692 substances are available for routine clinical use , ie , pegaptanib , ranibizumab , and bevacizumab . The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence supporting the use of ranibizumab in clinical practice . Most of the studies analyzed in this review are prospective , controlled clinical trials that have focused on documenting the therapeutic effect of ranibizumab and its safety , providing encouraging results .
