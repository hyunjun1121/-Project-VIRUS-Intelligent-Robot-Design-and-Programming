Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 elicits a P21554 -mediated decrease of excitatory transmission in rat P00915 hippocampus . Cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) ligands decrease excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus , but the influence of endogenously formed cannabinoids ( eCBs ) on basal excitatory transmission remains uncertain . Here , we investigated the influence of eCBs on synaptic transmission in P00915 hippocampus using the slice preparation . Blockade of P21554 with the selective receptor antagonists SR141716 ( rimonabant ) or AM251 augmented synaptic responses evoked upon stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals . This effect persisted in the presence of bicuculline or CGP55845 to block GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptors , revealing a tonic eCB influence on excitatory transmission . Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) with meloxicam or NS-398 decreased excitatory responses partly in a P21554 -dependent manner , independently of GABA(A) transmission . Paired-pulse paradigms suggested a presynaptic P21554 mechanism to decrease glutamate release . Inhibition of P23219 or other routes of eCB degradation did not affect synaptic transmission . We conclude that P35354 regulates the formation of P21554 ligands that decrease hippocampal excitatory transmission .
