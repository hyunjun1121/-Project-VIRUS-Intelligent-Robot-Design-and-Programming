Local immunotherapy of glioma patients with a combination of 2 bispecific antibody fragments and resting autologous lymphocytes : evidence for in situ t-cell activation and therapeutic efficacy . After adoptive transfer of pre-activated lymphocytes into the operation cavity of glioma patients , tumor regression and improved survival have been reported in some patients . Results were most impressive when bispecific antibodies with tumor x CD3 specificity were also applied . In this study , we attempted to avoid time-consuming pre-activation procedures for adoptively transferred cells by using a combination of bispecific antibodies directed to the P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) on tumor cells and to CD3 and P10747 on T cells . Eleven patients with high-grade malignant glioma received 3 injections of 2 bispecific antibody fragments ( P00533 x CD3 and P00533 x P10747 ) together with freshly isolated autologous lymphocytes via an Ommaya reservoir . Intracavitary fluid aspirated during immunotherapy was examined for markers of T-cell activation . Increased levels of soluble P60568 receptor and P01375 were detected in the intracavitary fluid of all patients tested . Two of the 11 treated patients experienced a beneficial response to therapy as defined by a transient contrast enhancement in subsequent Q9BWK5 scans and prolonged survival . Side effects were transient and consisted of fever , nausea , headache and aggravation of pre-existing neurologic deficits . These adverse effects were most likely due to the antibody construct containing anti-CD3 specificity . Two patients developed cerebral edema and required steroid treatment .
