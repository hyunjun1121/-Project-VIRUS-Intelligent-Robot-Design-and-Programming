Transcriptional regulation of the major HIV-1 coreceptor , P61073 , by the kappa opioid receptor . Previous studies have demonstrated that KOR activation results in decreased susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 in human PBMCs . In the present studies , we have found this effect is , in part , a result of down-regulation of the major HIV-1 coreceptor , P61073 . Using a combination of biochemical approaches , our results show that P61073 protein and mRNA levels were reduced significantly following KOR activation . We evaluated the nature of the signaling pathway(s) , which were induced by KOR activation , using transcription factor-binding array analysis and comparing extracts from control and KOR-activated cells . We determined that the IRFs and STATs were induced following KOR activation , and these events were important for the inhibition of P61073 expression . Using chemical inhibitors and siRNA constructs , we determined that O60674 , P40763 , and P14316 were critical members of this signal transduction pathway . Immediately following KOR activation , O60674 was phosphorylated , and this was required for the phosphorylation/activation of P40763 . Moreover , P14316 mRNA and protein expression were also up-regulated , and further studies using ChIP analysis showed that P14316 was induced to bind in vivo to the P61073 promoter . This is the first report detailing the initiation of a KOR-induced O60674 / P40763 and P14316 signaling cascade , and these pathways result in substantial down-regulation of P61073 expression . The capacity of KOR to down-regulate P61073 expression may provide a strategy for the development of novel therapeutics for the inhibition of HIV replication .
