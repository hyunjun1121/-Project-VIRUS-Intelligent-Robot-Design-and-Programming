NO modulates the molecular basis of rat interscapular brown adipose tissue thermogenesis . Molecular mechanisms underlying interscapular brown adipose tissue ( Q12908 ) thermogenesis were elucidated . Namely , gene and/or protein expression of uncoupling protein 1 ( P25874 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , PPARgamma-coactivator-1alpha ( P20142 -1alpha ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) - key molecules that regulate thermogenesis-related processes - mitochondriogenesis , angiogenesis and Q12908 hyperplasia , in rats subjected to cold ( 4+/-1 degrees C ) for 1 , 3 , 7 , 12 , 21 and 45days were investigated . Particularly , to examine influence of nitric oxide ( NO ) on Q12908 thermogenic-program , cold-exposed animals were treated by l-arginine or N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester ( L-NAME ) . Related to control ( 22+/-1 degrees C ) , cold induced time-coordinated P25874 , PPARgamma and P20142 -1alpha transcriptional activation accompanied by P12004 activation and increased P15692 immunolabeling that correlate with endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) transcriptional activation suggesting NO involvement in these thermogenic-factors activation . Observed molecular changes were translated into increased mitochondrial-remodeling , angiogenesis , and Q12908 hyperplasia . l- DB00125 augmented and prolonged cold-induced increase of P29474 , inducible NOS and thermogenic-molecules expression , Q12908 nerve supply , vascularity , hyperplasia and mitochondrial-remodeling , while L-NAME had an opposite effects . Results show that NO improves thermogenesis-related mitochondriogenesis , angiogenesis and tissue hyperplasia , positively affecting molecular basis of these processes , suggesting that NO is an essential regulator of Q12908 thermogenic-program operating , at genes , proteins and tissue structure levels .
