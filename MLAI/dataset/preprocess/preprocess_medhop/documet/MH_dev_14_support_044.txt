Thrombin inhibits migration of human hepatic myofibroblasts . Several lines of data recently pointed out a role of the serine proteinase thrombin in liver fibrogenesis , but its mechanism of action is unknown . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of thrombin on the migration of human liver myofibroblasts . We show here that thrombin inhibits both basal migration and platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -BB-induced migration of myofibroblasts . By using a thrombin antagonist , a protease-activated receptor ( PAR ) -1 mimetic peptide , and a P25116 antibody , we show that this effect is dependent on the catalytic activity of thrombin and on P25116 activation . Thrombin 's effect on basal migration was dependent on cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) activation because it was blocked by the P35354 inhibitors NS-398 and nimesulide , and pharmacological studies showed that it was relayed through prostaglandin E(2) and its EP(2) receptor . On the other hand , thrombin-induced inhibition of DB00102 -induced migration was not dependent on P35354 . We show that thrombin inhibits PDGF-induced Akt-1 phosphorylation . This effect was consecutive to inhibition of PDGF-beta receptor activation through active dephosphorylation . Thus thrombin , through two distinct mechanisms , inhibits both basal- and DB00102 -induced migration of human hepatic liver myofibroblasts . The fine tuning of myofibroblast migration may be one of the mechanisms used by thrombin to regulate liver fibrogenesis .
