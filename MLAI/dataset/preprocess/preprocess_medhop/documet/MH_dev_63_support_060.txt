Regulation of P61073 gene expression in breast cancer cells under diverse stress conditions . Chronic inflammation is a critical component in breast cancer progression . Pro-inflammatory mediators along with growth/survival factors within the tumor microenvironment potentiate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , P05231 , P01375 -α ) , chemotactic cytokines and their receptors ( P61073 , P48061 , P10145 ) and angiogenic factors ( P15692 ) that often overcome the effect of anti-inflammatory molecules ( P05112 , P22301 ) thus evading the host 's antitumor immunity . Detailed knowledge , therefore , of the regulatory mechanisms determining cytokine levels is essential to understand the pathogenesis of breast cancer . HIF-1α and NF-κB transcription factors are important players for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory and potentially oncogenic environment . HIF-1α is the key mediator of the cellular response to oxygen deprivation and induces the expression of genes involved in survival and angiogenesis within solid hypoxic tumors . The expression of these genes is often modulated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in neoplastic cells . Functional crosstalk between HIF-1α and p53 pathways mediated by modulators shared between the two transcription factors such as Q15788 and SIRT-1 differentially regulate the expression of distinct subsets of their target genes under variable stress conditions . In an attempt to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer-related inflammation , we investigated the role of the two common p53 and HIF-1α co-regulators Q15788 and SIRT-1 , in the expression of the highly potent metastatic chemokine receptor P61073 . Both Q15788 and SIRT-1 overexpression in DSFX-treated MCF-7 cells reduced P61073 cellular levels implying that both co-regulators are crucial factors in the determination of the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells .
