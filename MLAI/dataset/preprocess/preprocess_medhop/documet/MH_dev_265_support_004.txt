Non-redundant roles of phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms alpha and beta in glycoprotein VI-induced platelet signaling and thrombus formation . Platelets are activated by adhesion to vascular collagen via the immunoglobulin receptor , glycoprotein VI ( Q9HCN6 ) . This causes potent signaling toward activation of phospholipase Cgamma2 , which bears similarity to the signaling pathway evoked by T- and B-cell receptors . Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) plays an important role in collagen-induced platelet activation , because this activity modulates the autocrine effects of secreted ADP . Here , we identified the PI3K isoforms directly downstream of Q9HCN6 in human and mouse platelets and determined their role in Q9HCN6 -dependent thrombus formation . The targeting of platelet P42336 or -beta strongly and selectively suppressed Q9HCN6 -induced Ca(2+) mobilization and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production , thus demonstrating enhancement of phospholipase Cgamma2 by P42336 /beta . That P42336 and -beta have a non-redundant function in Q9HCN6 -induced platelet activation and thrombus formation was concluded from measurements of : ( i ) serine phosphorylation of Akt , ( ii ) dense granule secretion , ( iii ) intracellular Ca(2+) increases and surface expression of phosphatidylserine under flow , and ( iv ) thrombus formation , under conditions where P42336 /beta was blocked or p85alpha was deficient . In contrast , Q9HCN6 -induced platelet activation was insensitive to inhibition or deficiency of O00329 or -gamma . Furthermore , P42336 /beta , but not P48736 , contributed to Q9HCN6 -induced Rap1b activation and , surprisingly , also to Rap1b-independent platelet activation via Q9HCN6 . Together , these findings demonstrate that both P42336 and -beta isoforms are required for full Q9HCN6 -dependent platelet Ca(2+) signaling and thrombus formation , partly independently of Rap1b . This provides a new mechanistic explanation for the anti-thrombotic effect of PI3K inhibition and makes P42336 an interesting new target for anti-platelet therapy .
