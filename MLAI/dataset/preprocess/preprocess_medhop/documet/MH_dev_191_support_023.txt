DB05311 ( DX-88 ) , a plasma kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of hereditary angioedema and the prevention of blood loss in on-pump cardiothoracic surgery . BACKGROUND : P03952 plays a major role in the contact ( kallikrein-kinin ) cascade producing bradykinin . Bradykinin is a vasodilator , which increases vascular permeability , activates inflammation and produces pain . P03952 is also crosslinked to the coagulation system and the complement cascade . OBJECTIVE : DB05311 ( DX-88 ) is a potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein . DB05311 is a recombinantly produced and engineered small protein based on the first Kunitz domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor . It was identified through phage display technology . METHODS : The search terms ' ecallantide ' , ' DX-88 ' and ' hereditary angioedema ' were entered into Pubmed/Medline , ClinicalTrials and Google . RESULTS/CONCLUSION : At present , the drug is being studied for two major indications . First , the results for the treatment of hereditary angioedema are promising . Second , a prospective randomised multi-centre trial for the reduction of blood loss during on-pump cardiothoracic surgery will be terminated in October 2008 .
