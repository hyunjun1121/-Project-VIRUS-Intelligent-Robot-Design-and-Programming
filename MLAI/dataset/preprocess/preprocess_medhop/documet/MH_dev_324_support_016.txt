[ A novel function of anti-fibrinolytic factor , P05121 , in the central nervous system : a possible role as the neurotrophic factor ] . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is a serpin that suppresses fibrinolysis by inhibiting the activity of plasminogen activator ( PA ) . Together with PA , P05121 is expressed in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of PA activity . Our present study has demonstrated that , in cultures of PC-12 neurons , depletion of P05121 from the culture medium induces disappearance of the cell 's neurites and the cell death . DB06692 and antipain , the inhibitors of PA , were not counterparts of P05121 in the protection of neurite disappearance . We also found that P05121 had the abilities to promote release of the survival factors of neurons , P05231 and P15692 and activation of a survival serine/threonine kinase Akt . These results suggest that P05121 has physiological functions other than its role as PA inhibitor for the survival of neurons .
