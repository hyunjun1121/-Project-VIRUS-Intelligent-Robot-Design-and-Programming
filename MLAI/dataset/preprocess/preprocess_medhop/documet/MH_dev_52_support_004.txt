Antisense oligonucleotide to PKC-epsilon alters DB02527 -dependent stimulation of P13569 in Calu-3 cells . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) regulates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) channel activity but the PKC signaling mechanism is not yet known . The goal of these studies was to identify PKC isotype(s) required for control of P13569 function . P13569 activity was measured as 36Cl efflux in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing wild-type P13569 ( CHO-wtCFTR ) and in a Calu-3 cell line . Chelerythrine , a PKC inhibitor , delayed increased P13569 activity induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or with the DB02527 -generating agents (-)-epinephrine or forskolin plus 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'- cyclic monophosphate . Immunoblot analysis of Calu-3 cells revealed that P17252 , -betaII , -delta , -epsilon , and -zeta were expressed in confluent cell cultures . Pretreatment of cell monolayers with Lipofectin plus antisense oligonucleotide to PKC-epsilon for 48 h prevented stimulation of P13569 with (-)-epinephrine , reduced PKC-epsilon activity in unstimulated cells by 52.1 % , and decreased PKC-epsilon mass by 76.1 % but did not affect hormone-activated protein kinase A activity . Sense oligonucleotide to PKC-epsilon and antisense oligonucleotide to PKC-delta and -zeta did not alter (-)-epinephrine-stimulated P13569 activity . These results demonstrate the selective regulation of P13569 function by constitutively active PKC-epsilon .
