Implantation of P15692 transfected preadipocytes improves vascularization of fibrin implants on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) model . The successful substitution or augmentation of soft tissues by implantation of three dimensional cell constructs , consisting of human preadipocytes and fibrin glue as a carrier matrix , requires a rapid and homogeneous vascularization of the whole implant in order to provide a sufficient blood supply of centrally situated cells . Previous investigations have shown that under in vivo conditions primary human preadipocytes induce vascularization of fibrin matrices by secretion of several growth factors , such as P15692 and P09038 . The current study investigates whether vascularization of implants can be improved by transplantation of preadipocytes following transfection with a P15692 -vector . Transfection was performed by electroporation with an pCMX-GFP and pCMX-VEGF165 vector . Transfection efficiency ( GFP expression ) and P15692 expression were determined in vitro by FACS analysis and P15692 immunoassay , respectively . In vivo investigations to determine the vascularization of the implants were performed on the cylinder chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) . Four million P15692 transfected cells were transferred within a fibrin matrix onto the P62158 on the 7(th) day of incubation and after 8 days the vascularization of the implant was histologically examined and evaluated by means of a computer-assisted image analysis program . Transfection of preadipocytes with the GFP vector by electroporation yielded transfection efficiencies between 12 % and 41 % of surviving cells . Results of the P15692 immunoassay demonstrated that P15692 expression was significantly higher following transfection . Investigations on the P62158 outlined a significantly higher rate of vascularization in the transfected vs. control population . Our investigations demonstrate that primary human preadipocytes can be successfully transfected by electroporation with a P15692 vector . The enhanced P15692 expression on transfected cells results in an increase of vascularization of the cell constructs on the P62158 .
