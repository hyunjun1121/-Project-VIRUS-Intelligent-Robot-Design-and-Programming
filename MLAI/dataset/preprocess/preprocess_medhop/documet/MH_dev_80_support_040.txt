Immune modulation for cancer therapy . BACKGROUND : Immune modulation in cancer refers to a range of treatments aimed at harnessing a patient 's immune system to achieve tumour control , stabilisation , and potential eradication of disease . A novel therapeutic drug class called immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies modulate T-cell pathways that regulate T cells and have the potential to reinvigorate an antitumour immune response . DB06186 was the first FDA-approved immune checkpoint antibody licensed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma ( MM ) and blocks a checkpoint molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 ( P16410 ) . METHODS : Herein we review the preclinical and clinical development of ipilimumab . We outline the mode of action of these agents and other immune checkpoint inhibitors , the management of their toxicities , and how to adequately assess response to treatment . RESULTS : As a result of these data , a number of other antibodies that block novel checkpoint molecules including programmed death-1 ( P18621 ) , and corresponding ligands such as programmed death ligand-1 ( Q9NZQ7 ) are under preclinical and clinical development , and have demonstrated activity in multiple tumour types . CONCLUSIONS : This review will summarise the mechanism of action and clinical development of immune checkpoint antibodies , as well as lessons learned in the management and assessment of patients receiving these agents .
