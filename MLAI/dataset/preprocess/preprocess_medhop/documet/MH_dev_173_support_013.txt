P25021 mediated relaxation of buffalo ( Bubalus bubalus ) ureter . On the buffalo ureter , histamine did not elicit any direct effect . However , it caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the tissues precontracted by carbachol , phenylephrine , norepinephrine , KCI or BaCl2 and also inhibited the contractile effect of carbachol . DB08805 selectively antagonised the relaxation and inhibition of contractile response but mepyramine did not show this effect . Isoprenaline , dobutamine , salbutamol , verapamil and papaverine neither produced any direct effect nor relaxed the carbachol-contracted tissues ; norepinephrine and epinephrine had contractile effects . Hence , the histamine-induced relaxation was mediated through the activation of H2 receptors and not through adrenergic mechanisms or blockade of Ca(2+)-channels or inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase .
