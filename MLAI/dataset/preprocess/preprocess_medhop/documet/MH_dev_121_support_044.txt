2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-d-glucoside ameliorates vascular senescence and improves blood flow involving a mechanism of p53 deacetylation . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-d-glucoside ( THSG ) , a resveratrol analog with glucoside , has been shown in various studies to inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells , attenuate inflammation , and prevent vascular endothelial dysfunction . In the study , we examined the effects of THSG on vascular senescence and blood flow . METHODS AND RESULTS : Oral administration of THSG for 14 weeks , resulted in notable increases in blood flow in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRs ) ; and effective inhibition of vascular senescence as indicated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase ( SA-β-gal ) staining , phosphorylation of γ P16104 observed by stain analysis of immunofluorescence , and K373 acetylation of p53 in the aortic arches of SHRs . Oral administration of THSG also induced P29474 expression and urinary NOx production . THSG weekly activated Q96EB6 activity , stimulated P29474 promoter reporter gene activity , and ameliorated H(2)O(2)-induced cellular senescence and K373 acetylation of p53 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . CONCLUSIONS : THSG improves blood flow and ameliorates vascular senescence by increasing P29474 expression and Sirt1 activity and decreasing acetylation of p53 at K373 site , at least in part , both in vitro and in vivo .
