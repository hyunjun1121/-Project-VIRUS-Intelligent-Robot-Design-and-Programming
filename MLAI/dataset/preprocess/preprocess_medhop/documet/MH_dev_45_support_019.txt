DB01285 releasing hormone ( P06850 ) antagonist attenuates adjuvant induced arthritis : role of P06850 in peripheral inflammation . OBJECTIVE : To determine whether a corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) type 1-specific receptor antagonist , antalarmin , would alter the progression of inflammation in adjuvant induced arthritis ( AIA ) susceptible LEW/N rats by blocking local P06850 mediated inflammatory responses or render AIA resistant F344/N rats more susceptible to AIA by blocking central P06850 , thus reducing secretion of endogenous glucocorticoids . METHODS : F344/N and LEW/N rats were assigned to either drug or vehicle groups and treated with 20 mg/kg antalarmin or vehicle alone P55957 for 25 days by intraperitoneal injection . Arthritis was induced in both antalarmin and vehicle treated LEW/N and F344/N rats by subcutaneous injections at the base of the tail of incomplete Freund 's adjuvant containing 10 mg/ml heat killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Control F344/N and LEW/N rats were maintained on either antalarmin or vehicle . RESULTS : Chronic blockade of P34998 with systemic antalarmin significantly ameliorated AIA in LEW/N rats , reducing the severity of inflammation in peripheral joints , evidenced by clinical and histopathology scores , and weight loss associated with disease onset . Antalarmin neither induced nor exacerbated arthritis expression in F344/N or LEW/N rats , despite suppression of levels of adjuvant induced corticosterone , the major antiinflammatory glucocorticoid in rats . CONCLUSION : Systemic blockade of P06850 -RI appeared to predominantly block peripheral proinflammatory effects of immune P06850 , rather than the systemic glucocorticoid mediated antiinflammatory effects of hypothalamic P06850 . Results indicate that chronic treatment with a P06850 antagonist attenuates progressive inflammation induced degeneration of synovia , cartilage , and bone in arthritic joints , suggesting that antalarmin may have therapeutic potential in treatment of human autoimmune and inflammatory disorders .
