Elevated expression of urokinase-like plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 during the vascular remodeling associated with pulmonary thromboembolism . Information is lacking on the mechanisms involved in the organization , resolution , and repair of the vascular lumen after acute pulmonary thromboembolism . Because recent data suggest that the balance between plasminogen activators ( PAs ) and type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) plays a role in regulating cell migration within the extracellular matrix , we investigated the expression of these molecules by immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analysis of pulmonary artery specimens from patients suffering fatal pulmonary embolism . The data were compared with the expression of these molecules in both patients ' noninvolved pulmonary arteries and organ donor pulmonary arteries . Regions of initial organization and vascular remodeling were identified by a modified trichrome stain and by the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , a cell marker of proliferation . Staining for tissue-type PA antigen was low to undetectable in endothelial cells directly in contact with the fibrin-platelet thromboembolus and in areas in which the endothelial cell lining was replaced by cell growth into the thrombus . DB00013 -like PA ( u-PA ) expression was detected in mononuclear cells within the thrombus in the initial phase of thromboembolism and within cells migrating into the thrombus during the later stages of organization . P05121 expression was elevated in the monolayer of endothelial cells underlying the fresh platelet-fibrin thromboembolus and in a P12004 -positive cell population present between the pulmonary arterial intima and the thromboembolus that represents early organization . Increased expression of P05121 may play a role in inhibiting proteolysis and fostering the localization of the acute fibrin-platelet thrombus to the vascular wall , which is followed by the upregulation of u-PA in migrating cells during the reorganization process .
