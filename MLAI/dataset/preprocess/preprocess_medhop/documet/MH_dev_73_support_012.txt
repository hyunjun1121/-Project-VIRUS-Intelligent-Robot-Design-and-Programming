The cannabinoid DB00470 mediates inhibition of macrophage chemotaxis to RANTES/ P13501 : linkage to the CB2 receptor . The chemotactic response of murine peritoneal macrophages to RANTES/ P13501 was inhibited significantly following pretreatment with DB00470 ( THC ) , the major psychoactive component in marijuana . Significant inhibition of this chemokine directed migratory response was obtained also when the full cannabinoid agonist CP55940 was used . The CB2 receptor-selective ligand O-2137 exerted a robust inhibition of chemotaxis while the P21554 receptor-selective ligand ACEA had a minimal effect . The THC-mediated inhibition was reversed by the CB2 receptor-specific antagonist SR144528 but not by the P21554 receptor-specific antagonist SR141716A . In addition , THC treatment had a minimal effect on the chemotactic response of peritoneal macrophages from CB2 knockout mice . Collectively , these results suggest that cannabinoids act through the CB2 receptor to transdeactivate migratory responsiveness to RANTES/ P13501 . Furthermore , the results suggest that the CB2 receptor may be a constituent element of a network of G protein-coupled receptor signal transductional systems , inclusive of chemokine receptors , that act coordinately to modulate macrophage migration .
