Time course of the effects of a single bolus injection of F(ab')2 fragments of the antiplatelet P08514 /IIIa antibody 7E3 on arterial eversion graft occlusion , platelet aggregation , and bleeding time in dogs . The time course of the effects of a single intravenous bolus injection of 10 mg/kg aspirin or 0.8 mg/kg F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antiplatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antibody DB00054 [ 7E3-F(ab')2 ] on arterial occlusion , platelet aggregation , and bleeding time was studied in 30 dogs with an everted ( inside out ) carotid arterial segment inserted into the femoral artery . In the absence of an antiplatelet agent , the eversion grafts occluded spontaneously with platelet-rich thrombus within 30 minutes . With aspirin , arterial occlusion persisting for 2 hours occurred in 5 of 10 dogs and cyclic occlusion and reflow in 4 animals ; arterial occlusion was observed in all dogs at 24 hours . With 7E3-F(ab')2 , arterial patency persisted throughout a 2-hour observation period in all of 10 dogs and for 24 hours in 4 of the 10 dogs . Contralateral eversion grafting 24 hours after aspirin or 7E3-F(ab')2 injection was associated with graft patency for 2 hours in 1 of 5 aspirin dogs and in 3 of 5 7E3-F(ab')2 dogs ; patency persisted for 24 hours . In dogs grafted 48 hours after aspirin or 7E3-F(ab')2 injection , patency at 24 hours was seen in 0 of 5 dogs given aspirin and 3 of 5 dogs given 7E3-F(ab')2 . The overall frequencies of arterial graft patency at 2 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after study drug injection were significantly higher in the 7E3-F(ab')2 groups than in the aspirin groups ( P < .0005 , n = 10 in each group ; P < .05 , n = 15 ; P < .005 , n = 15 ; and P = .05 , n = 5 , respectively ) .
