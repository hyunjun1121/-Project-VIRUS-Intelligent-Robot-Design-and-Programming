MiR-24 tumor suppressor activity is regulated independent of p53 and through a target site polymorphism . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are predicted to regulate approximately 30 % of all human genes ; however , only a few miRNAs have been assigned their targets and specific functions . Here we demonstrate that miR-24 , a ubiquitously expressed miRNA , has an anti-proliferative effect independent of p53 function . Cell lines with differential p53 status were used as a model to study the effects of miR-24 on cell proliferation , cell cycle control , gene regulation and cellular transformation . Overexpression of miR-24 in six different cell lines , independent of p53 function , inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in G2/S cell cycle arrest . MiR-24 over expression in cells with wt-p53 upregulated P04637 and P38936 protein ; however , in p53-null cells miR-24 still induced cell cycle arrest without the involvement of P38936 . We show that miR-24 regulates p53-independent cellular proliferation by regulating an S-phase enzyme , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) a target of the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate ( MTX ) . Of interest , we found that a miR-24 target site polymorphism in P00374 3' UTR that results in loss of miR-24-function and high P00374 levels in the cell imparts a growth advantage to immortalized cells and induces neoplastic transformation . Of clinical significance , we found that miR-24 is deregulated in human colorectal cancer tumors and a subset of tumors has reduced levels of miR-24 . A novel function for miR-24 as a p53-independent cell cycle inhibitory miRNA is proposed .
