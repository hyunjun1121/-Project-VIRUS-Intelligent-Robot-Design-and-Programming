Expression and possible role of IGF-IR in the mouse gastric myenteric plexus and smooth muscles . P01308 -like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) and its receptor ( IGF-IR ) have tremendous trophic effects on the central , peripheral and enteric neurons . The loss of IGF-IR contributes to the development of diabetic gastroparesis . However , the nature and the function of the IGF-IR(+) cells in the gastric myenteric plexus remain unclear . In this study , anti- P28329 , anti-S100Î² or anti-c- P10721 antibodies were used to co-label IGF-IR(+) cells and neurons , glial cells or interstitial cells of Cajal ( ICCs ) , respectively . We also generated type 1 diabetic mice ( DM ) to explore the influence of impaired P05019 /IGF-IR in the myenteric neurons . Results showed that IGF-IR was expressed in the epithelium , smooth muscles and myenteric plexi of the mouse stomach . Most of the IGF-IR(+) cells in the myenteric plexi were P28329 (+) cholinergic neurons , but not enteric glial cells and there were more IGF-IR(+) neurons and fibers in the gastric antrum than in the corpus . The IGF-IR(+)/ P28329 (+) neurons and ICCs were closely juxtaposed , but distinctly distributed in the myenteric plexus , indicating a possible role for the IGF-IR(+)/ P28329 (+) neurons in the mediation of gastric motility through ICCs . Moreover , the decrease of IGF-IR and cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexi and smooth muscles of DM mice suggested that P05019 /IGF-IR signaling might play a role in neuron survival and neurite outgrowth , as well as stem cell factor ( P21583 ) production , which is required for the development of ICCs . Our results provide insights into the effects of P05019 /IGF-IR signaling on the development of gastrointestinal motility disorders .
