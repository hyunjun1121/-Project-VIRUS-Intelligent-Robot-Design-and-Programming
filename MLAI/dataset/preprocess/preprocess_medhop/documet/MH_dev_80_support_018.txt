New-onset mediastinal and central nervous system sarcoidosis in a patient with metastatic melanoma undergoing P16410 monoclonal antibody treatment . BACKGROUND : DB06186 , a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody that inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ( P16410 ) , has been established as an effective therapy in the management of advanced melanoma . Immune-mediated adverse events are a common side effect . CASE REPORT : A 37-year-old male patient was diagnosed with nodal and osseous metastatic melanoma 15 months after the initial surgical treatment for lower limb melanoma . Therapy with the anti- P16410 antibody , ipilimumab , was started . Follow-up staging imaging after treatment initiation showed symmetrical bihilar adenopathy . Transbronchial biopsy showed sarcoidosis . The patient had associated systemic symptoms of fatigue , joint pains , anorexia and weight loss . Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) , which was performed for the investigation of headaches , showed abnormal enhancing tissue in the sella turcica and adjacent to the pituitary infundibulum , consistent with neurosarcoidosis . The condition was successfully treated with corticosteroids . CONCLUSIONS : We report a case of immunotherapy-induced mediastinal/hilar sarcoidosis , with pituitary involvement , mimicking tumour progression . This highlights the need for awareness amongst radiologists and oncologists of the mechanism of action and potential side effects of new immunotherapies .
