A review of vilazodone , serotonin , and major depressive disorder . OBJECTIVE : To review the mechanism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) -mediated serotonergic neurotransmission , focusing on serotonin 1A ( P08908 ) autoreceptors , which are proposed to be involved in delaying therapeutic efficacy . DB06684 was specifically designed to function both as an SSRI and a partial agonist at P08908 receptors . This combined mechanism is proposed to decrease time to efficacy , minimize sexual side effects , and provide concomitant anxiolytic properties . DATA SOURCES : A PubMed search of all English-language articles from January 1990 to January 2013 was conducted using the search terms depression and 5-HT 1A , depression and buspirone , depression and pindolol , and vilazodone . STUDY SELECTION : We found 47 articles and abstracts that were selected for inclusion on the basis of information about the pharmacology of P08908 receptors and the clinical data on pindolol , buspirone , and vilazodone in depression . DATA EXTRACTION : This review summarizes current literature involving antidepressant activity , the role of P08908 autoreceptors , and clinical trials involving serotonin reuptake inhibition in conjunction with P08908 agonists and partial agonists , with a focus on vilazodone . RESULTS : DB06684 has demonstrated efficacy in 2 large , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials in major depressive disorder . RESULTS suggest that vilazodone has a low incidence of sexual side effects and is effective in patients with high levels of anxiety . A pooled analysis shows evidence of significant symptom reduction after only 1 week of therapy . CONCLUSIONS : If future studies corroborate the clinical benefits attributed to its mechanism of action , vilazodone may show potential advantages in terms of onset of action , sexual side effects , and anxiolytic activity in patients with major depressive disorder .
