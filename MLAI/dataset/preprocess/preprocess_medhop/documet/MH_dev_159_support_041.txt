AZD1480 blocks growth and tumorigenesis of P07949 - activated thyroid cancer cell lines . Persistent P07949 activation is a frequent event in papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) and medullary thyroid carcinoma ( P04629 ) . In these cancers , P07949 activates the P29323 /MAPK , the PI3K/AKT/ P42345 and the JAK/ P40763 pathways . Here , we tested the efficacy of a P23458 /2- inhibitor , AZD1480 , in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic P07949 . Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring P07949 / Q13635 ( TPC-1 ) , P07949 M918T ( MZ-CRC1 ) and P07949 C634W ( TT ) alterations , as well as TPC-1 xenografts , were treated with JAK inhibitor , AZD1480 . This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro , as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts , where it efficiently blocked P40763 activation in tumor and stromal cells . This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation , decreased blood vessel density , coupled with increased necrosis . However , AZD1480 repressed the growth of P40763 - deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo , demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of P40763 in the tumor cells . In all cell lines , the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 P07949 levels , and P42345 effector phospho-S6 , while P23458 /2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor P07949 and S6 activation . In conclusion , AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated P07949 - thyroid cancer cell lines , likely through direct P07949 inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment ( e.g. via JAK/phospho- P40763 inhibition in endothelial cells ) . Thus , AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of P07949 - activated thyroid cancers .
