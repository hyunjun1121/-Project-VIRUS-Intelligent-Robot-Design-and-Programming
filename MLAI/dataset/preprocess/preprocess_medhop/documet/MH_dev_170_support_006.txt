Increased levels of Candida albicans mannan-specific T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules in patients with invasive candidiasis . In addition to cytokines , P01730 + T cells have been found to secrete soluble , T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules ( TABMs ) . These antigen-specific immunoproteins are thought to have immunoregulatory properties in the suppression of cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) because they often associate with interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) and transforming growth factor beta . Decreased CMI causes susceptibility to infections caused by organisms which are normally nonpathogenic . In this situation , e.g. , Candida albicans saprophytism may develop into invasive candidiasis . The difficult diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is based on the findings obtained from blood cultures and with tissue biopsy specimens , with some additional diagnostic value gained by the detection of Candida albicans mannan antigenemia and antimannan antibodies . In the present study , Candida albicans mannan-specific TABM ( P62158 -TABM ) levels in the sera of patients with invasive candidiasis ( n = 11 ) , Candida colonization ( n = 11 ) and noncolonization ( n = 10 ) , recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis ( n = 30 ) , and atopic eczema dermatitis syndrome ( n = 59 ) and healthy controls ( n = 30 ) were analyzed . For 14 participants , the effect of mannan stimulation on TABM production and gamma interferon ( P01579 ) and P05112 mRNA expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied . It was demonstrated that P62158 -TABM production was the highest in patients with invasive candidiasis and that P62158 -TABM levels could distinguish Candida-colonized patients from noncolonized patients . In addition , the P62158 -TABM level was directly related to mRNA expression for P05112 but not P01579 . These results reinforce the view that TABMs are associated with decreased CMI , immunoregulation , and the T-helper cell 2-type immune response .
