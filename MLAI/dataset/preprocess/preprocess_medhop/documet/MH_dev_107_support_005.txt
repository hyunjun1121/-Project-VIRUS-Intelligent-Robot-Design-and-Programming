Comparison of three GPCR structural templates for modeling of the Q9H244 nucleotide receptor . The P2Y(12) receptor ( P2Y(12)R ) is an ADP-activated G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that is an important target for antithrombotic drugs . Three homology models of P2Y(12)R were compared , based on different GPCR structural templates : bovine rhodopsin ( bRHO ) , human A(2A) adenosine receptor ( A(2A)AR ) , and human P61073 ( P61073 ) . By criteria of sequence analysis ( 25.6 % identity in transmembrane region ) , deviation from helicity in the second transmembrane helix ( TM2 ) , docked poses of ligands highlighting the role of key residues , accessibility of a conserved disulfide bridge that is reactive toward irreversibly-binding antagonists , and the presence of a shared disulfide bridge between the third extracellular loop ( EL3 ) and the N-terminus , the P61073 -based model appeared to be the most consistent with known characteristics of P2Y(12)R . The docked poses of agonist 2MeSADP and charged anthraquinone antagonist PSB-0739 in the binding pocket of P2Y(12)R-CXC agree with previously published site-directed mutagenesis studies of Arg256 and Lys280 . A sulfonate at position 2 of the anthraquinone core created a strong interaction with the Lys174(EL2) side chain . The docking poses of the irreversibly-binding , active metabolite ( existing as two diastereoisomers in vivo ) of the clinically utilized antagonist DB00758 were compared . The free thiol group of the 4S diastereoisomer , but not the 4R isomer , was found in close proximity ( ~4.7 Ã… ) to the sulfur atom of a disulfide bridge involving Cys175 , suggesting greater activity in covalent binding . Therefore , ligand docking to the P61073 -based model of the P2Y(12)R predicted poses of both reversibly and irreversibly-binding small molecules , consistent with observed pharmacology and mutagenesis studies .
