Arachidonic acid signaling is involved in the mechanism of imidazoline-induced KATP channel-independent stimulation of insulin secretion . The mechanism by which the novel , pure glucose-dependent insulinotropic , imidazoline derivative BL11282 promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic islets has been investigated . The roles of KATP channels , alpha2-adrenoreceptors , the I1-receptor-phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase ( PC- P98160 ) pathway and arachidonic acid signaling in BL11282 potentiation of insulin secretion in pancreatic islets were studied . Using Q09428 (-/-) deficient mice , the previous notion that the insulinotropic activity of BL11282 is not related to its interaction with KATP channels was confirmed . Insulinotropic activity of BL11282 was not related to its effect on alpha2-adrenoreceptors , I1-imidazoline receptors or PC- P98160 . BL11282 significantly increased [3H]arachidonic acid production . This effect was abolished in the presence of the iPLA2 inhibitor , bromoenol lactone . The data suggest that potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release by BL11282 , which is independent of concomitant changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration , involves release of arachidonic acid by iPLA2 and its metabolism to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids through the cytochrome P-450 pathway .
