DB00065 therapy in pulmonary fibrosis associated with collagen vascular disease . OBJECTIVE : To study the potential effectiveness of tumor necrosis factor a ( P01375 ) inhibitor treatment for pulmonary fibrosis associated with a collagen vascular disease , CVD ( rheumatoid arthritis , RA and systemic sclerosis , SSc ) refractory to conventional treatment . METHODS : Four patients ( three men with RA , one woman with SSc ) were treated with infliximab . All patients received 3mg/kgr of infliximab at intervals 0 , 2 and 6 weeks , and then maintenance infusions every 8 weeks afterwards for at least a 12-month period . Patients had active disease despite treatment with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents . RESULTS : Treatment was well-tolerated from all patients . Pulmonary fibrosis remained stable during treatment in terms of symptoms , pulmonary function tests ( PFTs ) and High resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) appearance . As expected , a clinical response was observed in joint symptoms in patients with RA as evaluated by the DAS28 ( Disease Activity Score , the 28 joint version ) . CONCLUSION : This study suggests that inhibition of P01375 with infliximab may stabilize the progression of pulmonary fibrosis associated with CVD . Prospective , controlled trials are necessary to determine the efficacy of infliximab in pulmonary fibrosis associated CVD .
