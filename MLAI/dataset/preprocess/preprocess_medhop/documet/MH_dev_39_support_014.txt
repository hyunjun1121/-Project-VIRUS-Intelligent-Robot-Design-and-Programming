Increased angiogenesis protects against adipose hypoxia and fibrosis in metabolic disease-resistant 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( HSD1 ) -deficient mice . In obesity , rapidly expanding adipose tissue becomes hypoxic , precipitating inflammation , fibrosis , and insulin resistance . Compensatory angiogenesis may prevent these events . Mice lacking the intracellular glucocorticoid-amplifying enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 ( 11βHSD1(-/-) ) have " healthier " adipose tissue distribution and resist metabolic disease with diet-induced obesity . Here we show that adipose tissues of 11βHSD1(-/-) mice exhibit attenuated hypoxia , induction of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1α ) activation of the TGF-β/ P84022 /α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) signaling pathway , and fibrogenesis despite similar fat accretion with diet-induced obesity . Moreover , augmented 11βHSD1(-/-) adipose tissue angiogenesis is associated with enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) -inducible expression of the potent angiogenic factors P15692 , apelin , and angiopoietin-like protein 4 . Improved adipose angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis provide a novel mechanism whereby suppression of intracellular glucocorticoid regeneration promotes safer fat expansion with weight gain .
