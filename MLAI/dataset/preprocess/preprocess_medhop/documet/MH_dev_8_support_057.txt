DB08890 -a novel secretagogue in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation . Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ( IBS-C ) and chronic idiopathic constipation ( Q96RK0 ) are highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorders . Traditional symptoms based therapies had somewhat limited success and efficacy in addressing the disorders . Recently , linaclotide emerged as novel peptide capable of improving abdominal symptoms in patients suffering from IBS-C and Q96RK0 . Guanylate cyclase C ( P25092 ) receptor a multi domain protein , found to be molecular target for linaclotide which acts by activating P25092 receptor on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells . Binding of linaclotide to P25092 receptor triggers the elevation of second messenger cGMP that elicits fluid secretion into intestinal cells which play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis through cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . Data from Phase II and III clinical trials demonstrated that linaclotide seems to produce a statistically significant increase in stool frequency , improved straining , decreased abdominal pain and discomfort .
