P00505 from rat heart is phosphorylated on Tyr19 in response to insulin stimulation . The cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein from rat heart ( P05413 , M(r) 15,000 ) as well as FABP from mouse adipocytes ( P15090 , 62 % homologous with P05413 ) contain a recognition sequence for protein tyrosine kinases , DB00174 - DB00120 - DB00128 - DB00128 -Tyr19 . P15090 has been shown by others to be partly phosphorylated on Tyr19 , thus encouraging experiments designed to search for phosphotyrosine in P05413 . For this purpose isolated cardiac myocytes were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis . A 15 kDa phosphoprotein present in the cytosolic protein fraction was specifically precipitated by a polyclonal antibody against rat heart FABP . Characterization of the phosphorylated FABP was facilitated by the development of an immunoaffinity purification procedure capable of isolating more than 200 micrograms FABP from four rat hearts in one step . Phosphoamino acid analysis and radiosequencing of the major tryptic phosphopeptide from immunopurified FABP revealed Tyr19 as the phosphorylated amino acid . Stimulation of cardiac myocytes with insulin in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors led to a several-fold increase in the amount of phosphorylated FABP compared with a nearly undetectable level found without insulin stimulation , indicating that FABP may be a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase . Phosphorylated FABP constitutes only a minor fraction compared to the large pool of FABP in the cardiac myocyte , thus obscuring the significance of this modification . However , as the phosphorylated Tyr19 residue is positioned within a helix-turn-helix-related domain of FABP , this modification may modulate a hitherto unknown DNA binding activity of FABP . A hypothesis is discussed in which phosphorylated FABP serves as a signalling molecule in the insulin signal transduction cascade .
