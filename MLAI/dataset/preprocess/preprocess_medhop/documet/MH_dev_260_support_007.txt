Suppression of inducible cyclooxygenase 2 gene transcription by aspirin and sodium salicylate . The pharmacological action of salicylate can not be explained by its inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) activity . In this report , the effects of aspirin and sodium salicylate on P35354 expressions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and foreskin fibroblasts were evaluated . DB00945 and sodium salicylate at therapeutic concentrations equipotently blocked P35354 mRNA and protein levels induced by interleukin-1beta and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate . The suppressing effect was more pronounced in cultured cells deprived of fetal bovine serum for 24 h , suggesting that it may be cell cycle related . Salicylate inhibited nascent P35354 transcript synthesis but had no effect on P35354 mRNA stability . It inhibited P35354 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner . In mice pretreated with aspirin ( 10 and 30 mg/kg ) , followed by challenge with lipopolysaccharide , P35354 mRNA expression in peritoneal macrophages was markedly suppressed . These findings suggest that salicylate exerts its antiinflammatory action in part by suppressing P35354 induction , thereby reducing the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins .
