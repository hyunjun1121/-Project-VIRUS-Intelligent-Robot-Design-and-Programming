Cannabinoid agonists in the treatment of blepharospasm -- a case report study . The benign essential blepharospasm is a subliminal form of primary torsion dystonia with still uncertain aetiology . It is characterized by involuntary convulsive muscle contractions of the M. orbicularis occuli , accompanied by unbearable pain of the cornea , eye bulb and the muscle itself . It has been suggested that blepharospasm is neurobiologically based on a dysfunction of the basal ganglia and an impairment of the dopamine neurotransmitter system . Therefore , therapy of blepharospasm contains administration of anticholinergic- and tranquillizing drugs as well as botulinum toxin as neuromuscular blocking agent . However serious side effects can be observed as well as failure of therapy . In the brain a dense co-localisation of cannabinoid ( P21554 ) and dopamine ( D2 ) -receptor was identified which had been associated with the influence of cannabinoids on the dopaminergic reward system . Additionally , it has been demonstrated that cannabinoids may have an impact on the central GABAergic and glutaminergic transmitter system and thus might be involved in the influence of movement control . In the present case we administered the cannabinoid receptor agonist Dronabinol ( Delta-9- DB00470 ) to a woman suffering from severe blepharospasm . Multiple treatments with botulinum toxin did not reveal a long-lasting beneficial effect . By contrast , treatment with 25 mg Dronabinol for several weeks improved the patients ' social life and attenuated pain perception remarkably . This case study demonstrates that the therapy with a cannabinoid agonist may provide a novel tool in the treatment of blepharospasm and maybe of other multifactorial related movement disorders .
