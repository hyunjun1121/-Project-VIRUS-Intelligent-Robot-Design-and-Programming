DB00065 downregulates interferon-gamma production in activated gut T-lymphocytes from patients with Crohn 's disease . The tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) neutralizing antibody , DB00065 ( Ifx ) , reduces disease activity in patients with active steroid-dependent or fistulizing Crohn 's disease . The mechanisms underlying the effects of Ifx are not fully understood . This study aims to investigate if and how Ifx regulates the interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) production in human intestinal T-cells . Colonic T cells were expanded from 25 patients with Crohn 's disease and ten healthy controls in an in vitro system , using medium supplemented with interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 but without exogenous antigen . The effect of Ifx was investigated in these in situ activated T cell cultures regarding the P01579 production , proliferation , transmembrane P01375 expression , cytolysis and apoptosis . T cell cultures from patients with Crohn 's disease produced significantly higher levels of P01579 ( < 0.001 ) and P01375 ( P=0.04 ) than T cell cultures from healthy controls . The production of P01579 was downregulated by Ifx in early T cell cultures ( P=0.002 ) . Ifx bound to transmembrane P01375 of activated T cells without inducing complement-mediated cytolysis , apoptosis and without affecting proliferation . Besides its known P01375 neutralizing property , Ifx downregulates P27352 -gamma production in colonic T cell cultures . Colonic T cells express transmembrane P01375 that binds Ifx . The data suggest that Ifx reduces the level of at least two pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to lower disease activity .
