Preclinical rationale for combining an P00533 antibody with cisplatin/gemcitabine for the treatment of NSCLC . BACKGROUND : Although the addition of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) antibodies to various platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is being actively pursued in the clinic , rationale for the prioritization of specific regimens is lacking . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We evaluated the antitumor effects of necitumumab , a recombinant human IgG1 antibody targeting P00533 , in combination with cisplatin plus gemcitabine , pemetrexed , or paclitaxel in a panel of 9 subcutaneous tumor models of NSCLC established in nu/nu athymic mice . RESULTS : DB09559 in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine was particularly effective , although interestingly , the mechanisms underlying these benefits were model dependent . For example , increased tumor cell apoptosis contributed towards combination efficacy in the A549 model , in association with increased expression of hsa-miR-29b and reduced expression of antiapoptotic genes including DNA methyltransferase Q9UBC3 , commonly up-regulated in patients with NSCLC . Such inverse effects of combination therapy on Q9UBC3 and hsa-miR-29b expression were found in multiple models . Importantly , in the A549 model , hsa-miR-29b down-regulation of DMNT3b reduced promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes such as Q9BY67 ( Q9BY67 ) , Ras associated ( Q12967 /AF-6 ) domain family member 1 ( Q9NS23 ) , and Fragile histidine triad gene ( P49789 ) , increasing their expression . CONCLUSION : These results offer a preclinical rationale for combining an P00533 antibody with cisplatin/gemcitabine for patients with NSCLC , and provide potential molecular biomarkers for tailoring therapy .
