Enhancement of antibody responses to Bacillus anthracis protective antigen domain IV by use of calreticulin as a chimeric molecular adjuvant . The generation of protective humoral immune responses against the receptor-binding domain ( domain IV ) of protective antigen [ PA(dIV) ] of Bacillus anthracis represents a plausible approach against anthrax toxin . In the current study , we have developed a naked DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin ( CRT ) linked to PA(dIV) of Bacillus anthracis [ CRT/PA(dIV) ] . We transfected a human embryonic kidney cell line ( P29320 293 ) with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA and performed Western blotting and confocal microscopy analysis . We found that linkage of CRT to PA(dIV) targets PA(dIV) to the endoplasmic reticulum , resulting in secretion of the chimeric CRT/PA(dIV) protein . We then evaluated the ability of CRT/PA(dIV) DNA to generate PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses and protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin ( PA plus lethal factor ) challenge . We found that mice immunized with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA were capable of rapidly inducing significantly higher PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses than mice immunized with PA(dIV) DNA alone . Furthermore , we observed that this enhanced antibody response generated by CRT/PA(dIV) DNA was P01730 dependent , since P01730 knockout mice demonstrated a significant reduction in antibody responses . In addition , analysis of the titers and avidity maturation of the induced PA-specific antibodies revealed that vaccination with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA vaccine accelerated the avidity maturation of antibodies to PA(dIV) compared to vaccination with PA(dIV) DNA . Importantly , the enhanced antibody responses correlated to protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin challenge . Thus , DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to PA(dIV) may dramatically enhance PA-specific protective antibody responses . Our results have significant clinical applications for biodefense against anthrax toxin .
