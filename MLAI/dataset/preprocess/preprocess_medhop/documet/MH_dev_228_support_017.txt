Combination of DB05210 and gefitinib induces apoptosis of triple-negative breast cancer cells through the PI3K/AKT- P42345 pathway . To investigate the apoptotic mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) cells induced by gefitinib and PI3K inhibitor DB05210 . MDA-MB-231 , MDA-MB-436 , and MCF-7 cells were incubated with 0.1 μmol/l gefitinib , 1 μmol/l gefitinib , 10 μmol/l gefitinib , 1 μmol/l DB05210 , 0.1 μmol/l gefitinib+1 μmol/l DB05210 , 1 μmol/l gefitinib+1 μmol/l DB05210 , and 10 μmol/l gefitinib+1 μmol/l DB05210 . Then , cell viability and survival were determined using an 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay and Hoechst staining . The apoptosis-related factors and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B , the mammalian target of rapamycin ( PI3K/AKT- P42345 ) signaling pathway-related factors were detected by western blot . For TNBC cells , cell viability or survival was not significantly inhibited by gefitinib or DB05210 alone ; however , marked cell apoptosis was noted in the gefitinib and DB05210 combination groups , and this effect was dose dependent . Also , the expressions of apoptosis markers , such as cleaved caspase-3 , Bcl-2/Bax , were altered by the gefitinib and DB05210 combination . Moreover , phosphorylated AKT ( p-AKT ) and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6-kinase ( p-p70S6K ) were also inhibited by the gefitinib and DB05210 combination , which may be responsible for the apoptosis . Gefitinib combined with DB05210 could induce cell apoptosis in TNBC cells and this effect was mediated through the P00533 -PI3K-AKT- P42345 -p70S6K pathway . Our studies have set the stage for future clinical trials of TNBC therapy by the combination of gefitinib and DB05210 .
