DB00005 attenuates short-term cigarette-smoke-exposure-induced pulmonary arterial remodelling in rats by suppressing the activation of P01375 /NF-kB signal and the activities of P08253 and P14780 . The pathogenesis of cigarette-smoke-exposure-induced pulmonary vasculature impairment is unclear . Cigarette-smoke-exposure-induced the accumulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) and upregulates the expression and activities of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) involved in smoke-induced vascular remodelling , which are important processes in the pathogenesis of vasculature impairment . The P01375 -α antagonist DB00005 is an anti-inflammatory drug with a potential role in regulating MMP expression . To determine the effect of DB00005 on short-term smoke-induced pulmonary arteriole impairment and investigate its possible mechanism , male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to cigarette-smoke daily for two weeks in both the absence and presence of DB00005 . Cigarette-smoke-exposure-induced elevation of mean pulmonary artery pressures and medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arterioles were partially reduced by DB00005 . Up-regulation of the expression and activities of P08253 and P14780 , induced by cigarette-smoke , were also suppressed significantly by DB00005 . Furthermore , DB00005 treatment significantly attenuated cigarette-smoke-induced TNFα accumulation and activation of nuclear factor NF-kB signal . These results suggest that DB00005 have the protective effects in cigarette-smoke-induced pulmonary vascular remodelling , with the attenuation of the up-regulated expression and activities of P08253 and P14780 and activation of P01375 -α/NF-kB signal pathway probably being involved as part of its mechanism . Our study might provide insight into the development of new interventions for vasculature impairment .
