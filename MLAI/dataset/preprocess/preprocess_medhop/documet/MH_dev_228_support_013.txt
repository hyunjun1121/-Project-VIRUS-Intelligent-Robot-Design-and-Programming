DB09222 binding potentiates P09038 but not P15692 induced expression of u-PA , u-PAR , and P05121 in endothelial cells . Endothelial cell responses at sites of injury occur in a fibrin matrix and are regulated by growth factors including those of the FGF and P15692 families . The pericellular proteolytic balance is important in these responses , and P09038 and P15692 up-regulate endothelial cell u-PA , u-PAR and P05121 . Because both P15692 and P09038 bind to fibrinogen , we have examined the capacity of fibrinogen to modulate the up-regulation of these proteins by P09038 and P15692 . Confluent cultures of endothelial cells were exposed to P09038 , P15692 , and fibrinogen or to combinations of growth factors with fibrinogen . Changes in mRNA levels of u-PA , u-PAR and P05121 were measured by Northern blot . P09038 increased u-PA , u-PAR , and P05121 mRNA , but there was a significantly greater induction when fibrinogen was added to P09038 at all concentrations . The potentiation by fibrinogen was particularly evident at an P09038 concentration of 0.1 ng mL(-1) , which resulted in non-significant change in transcript levels by itself , but significantly increased up to 2.6-fold with fibrinogen . P15692 also increased endothelial cell expression of u-PA , u-PAR and P05121 , but this effect was not potentiated by fibrinogen . Addition of LM609 , a monoclonal antibody to alphaVbeta3 , significantly inhibited induction of u-PA mRNA and activity by fibrinogen-bound P09038 compared to P09038 . A monoclonal antibody to P11362 also inhibited u-PA mRNA expression induced by fibrinogen-bound P09038 . We conclude that fibrinogen increases the capacity of P09038 , but not of P15692 , to up-regulate u-PA , u-PAR , and P05121 in endothelial cells and that fibrinogen-bound P09038 requires alphaVbeta3 binding to up-regulate endothelial cell u-PA .
