ELK3 suppresses angiogenesis by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of ETS-1 on P50281 . Ets transcription factors play important roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis . Knockout of the Ets gene family members in mice resulted in disrupted angiogenesis and malformed vascular systems . In this study , the role and mechanism of ELK3 , an Ets factor , in angiogenesis was investigated using ELK3-specific siRNA in human vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and in vivo implantation assay . The suppression of ELK3 expression resulted in the reinforcement of P15692 -induced tube formation in HUVECs . The in vivo Matrigel plug assay also showed that ELK3 knockdown resulted in increased angiogenesis . Luciferase activity of the P50281 promoter induced by ETS-1 factor was attenuated ELK3 co-transfection . Q9UNE7 assay showed the binding of ELK3 on the P50281 promoter . P50281 knockdown in the ELK3 knockdowned cells resulted in the decrease of tube formation suggesting that P50281 transcriptional repression is required for ELK3-mediated anti-angiogenesis effect . Our data also showed that the suppressive effect of ELK3 on the angiogenesis was partly due to the inhibitory effect of ELK3 to the ETS-1 transcriptional activity on the P50281 promoter rather than direct suppression of ELK3 on the target gene , since the expression level of co-repressor Sin3A is low in endothelial cells . Our results suggest that ELK3 plays a negative role of P15692 -induced angiogenesis through indirectly inhibiting ETS-1 function .
