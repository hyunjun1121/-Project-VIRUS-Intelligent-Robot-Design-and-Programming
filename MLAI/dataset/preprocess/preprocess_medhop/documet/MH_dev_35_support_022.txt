EPO receptor circuits for primary erythroblast survival . EPO functions primarily as an erythroblast survival factor , and its antiapoptotic actions have been proposed to involve predominantly P19957 -kinase and BCL-X pathways . Presently , the nature of EPO-regulated survival genes has been investigated through transcriptome analyses of highly responsive , primary bone marrow erythroblasts . Two proapoptotic factors , Bim and FoxO3a , were rapidly repressed not only via the wild-type P19235 , but also by PY-deficient knocked-in P19235 alleles . In parallel , Pim1 and Pim3 kinases and Irs2 were induced . For this survival gene set , induction failed via a PY-null P19235 -HM allele , but was restored upon reconstitution of a PY343 P42229 -binding site within a related P19235 -H allele . Notably , P19235 -HM supports erythropoiesis at steady state but not during anemia , while P19235 -H exhibits near wild-type P19235 activities . P19235 -H and the wild-type P19235 ( but not P19235 -HM ) also markedly stimulated the expression of Trb3 pseudokinase , and intracellular serpin , Serpina-3G . For SERPINA-3G and TRB3 , ectopic expression in EPO-dependent progenitors furthermore significantly inhibited apoptosis due to cytokine withdrawal . BCL-XL and P10415 also were studied , but in highly responsive Kit(pos)CD71(high)Ter119(neg) erythroblasts , neither was EPO modulated . P19235 survival circuits therefore include the repression of Bim plus FoxO3a , and P19235 /PY343/ P42229 -dependent stimulation of Pim1 , Pim3 , Irs2 plus Serpina-3G , and Trb3 as new antiapoptotic effectors .
