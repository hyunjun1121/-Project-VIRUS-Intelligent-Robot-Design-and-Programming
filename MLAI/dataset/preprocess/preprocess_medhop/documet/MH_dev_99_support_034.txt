Evaluation of hypoxia inducible factor expression in inflammatory and neurodegenerative brain models . The neuroinflammatory process is thought to contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and brain pathologies . The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activated glial cells , astrocytes and microglia plays an important role in this process . However , the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) , the key transcription factor regulating the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes , during glial activation is less known . Thus , we examined the significance of HIF-1α in three experimental models : first in an acute model of inflammation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines P01375 -α , IL-1β and IFN-γ ; secondly , in a chronic model of inflammation using an APPswe/PS1dE9 ( P05067 / P49768 ) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer 's disease and thirdly via the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in a model of neuronal apoptosis . During acute glial inflammation induced by in vitro administration of P01375 -α , IL-1β and IFN-γ , mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α were significantly upregulated ; however , this effect was blocked by SP600126 , a pharmacological inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) . These data suggest that MAPKs could be involved in HIF-1α regulation . In addition , we observed that HIF-1α is not involved in the neuronal apoptotic process mediated by P19957 -kinase inhibition , which is regulated by c-Jun . Finally , we did not detect significant differences in the expression of HIF-1α mRNA in P05067 / P49768 mice during the course of the study ( 3-12 months of age ) . Thus , we demonstrated that HIF-1α has a prominent role in acute but not in chronic inflammatory processes , such as the one which occurs in the P05067 / P49768 experimental model of AD . Moreover , HIF-1α is not involved in neuronal apoptosis after PI3K/AKT inhibition .
