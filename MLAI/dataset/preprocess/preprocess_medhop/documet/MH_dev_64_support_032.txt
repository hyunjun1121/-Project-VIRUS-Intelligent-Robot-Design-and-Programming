DB08916 combined with cetuximab for lung adenocarcinoma with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . We report a patient with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ( O15467 ) after 4 years of multiple treatments . High-dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) was given for O15467 at first but was not effective . She then received dual therapy combining of afatinib and cetuximab . Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) showed a partial response of disease and the patient experienced a clinical benefit . Our case suggests that dual targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) by a combination of afatinib and cetuximab can be a potential novel treatment option in treating O15467 when high-dose TKI failed .
