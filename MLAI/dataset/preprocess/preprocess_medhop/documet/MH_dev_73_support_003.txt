DB00898 inhibits luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone release by activating the endocannabinoid system . We hypothesized that ethanol ( EtOH ) might act through the endocannabinoid system to inhibit luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) release . Therefore , we examined the mechanism by which EtOH and anandamide ( AEA ) , an endogenous cannabinoid , inhibit P01148 release from incubated medial basal hypothalamic explants . In previous work , we demonstrated that EtOH inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-stimulated release of P01148 by increasing the release of two neurotransmitters : beta-endorphin and gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) . In the present work , bicuculline , a GABAergic antagonist , completely prevented the inhibition of AEA ( 10(-9)M ) on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced P01148 release , but naltrexone , a micro-opioid receptor antagonist , had no effect . AEA also significantly increased GABA release but had no effect on beta-endorphin release . Therefore , AEA could inhibit P01148 release by increasing GABA but not beta-endorphin release . Because EtOH and AEA acted similarly to inhibit P01148 release , we investigated whether both substances would affect the adenylate cyclase activity acting through the same GTP-coupled receptors , the cannabinoid receptors 1 ( P21554 -rs ) . AEA and EtOH ( 10(-1)M ) reduced the forskolin-stimulated accumulation of DB02527 , but AM251 , a specific antagonist of P21554 -r , significantly blocked that inhibition . Additionally we investigated whether P21554 -r is involved in the inhibition of P01148 by EtOH and AEA . AEA and EtOH reduced forskolin-stimulated P01148 release , but AM251 significantly blocked that inhibition . Also , we demonstrated that EtOH did not act by increasing AEA synthase activity to inhibit P01148 release in our experimental conditions . Therefore , our results indicate that EtOH inhibits the release of P01148 acting through the endocannabinoid system .
