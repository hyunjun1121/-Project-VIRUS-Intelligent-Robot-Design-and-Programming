Endometrial regenerative cells : a novel stem cell population . Angiogenesis is a critical component of the proliferative endometrial phase of the menstrual cycle . Thus , we hypothesized that a stem cell-like population exist and can be isolated from menstrual blood . Mononuclear cells collected from the menstrual blood contained a subpopulation of adherent cells which could be maintained in tissue culture for > 68 doublings and retained expression of the markers P21926 , CD29 , CD41a , P16070 , P13987 , CD73 , CD90 and CD105 , without karyotypic abnormalities . Proliferative rate of the cells was significantly higher than control umbilical cord derived DB05914 , with doubling occurring every 19.4 hours . These cells , which we termed " Endometrial Regenerative Cells " ( ERC ) were capable of differentiating into 9 lineages : cardiomyocytic , respiratory epithelial , neurocytic , myocytic , endothelial , pancreatic , hepatic , adipocytic , and osteogenic . Additionally , ERC produced P08254 , P09238 , GM- P04141 , angiopoietin-2 and DB00102 at 10-100,000 fold higher levels than two control cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cell lines . Given the ease of extraction and pluripotency of this cell population , we propose ERC as a novel alternative to current stem cells sources .
