Q9UBK8 Q9UBK8 66A > G has no effect on total homocysteine , folate , and DB00115 concentrations in renal transplant patients . The association of variants of the gene encoding methionine synthase reductase ( Q9UBK8 ) with hyperhomocysteinemia , folate and Vitamin B(12) status in kidney graft recipients is unknown . We examined two mutations in Q9UBK8 in a cross-sectional study of 733 kidney graft recipients . The allele frequency of Q9UBK8 66G was 0.55 . 369 patients ( 50.3 % ) were heterozygous and 219 patients ( 29.9 % ) were homozygous for the mutation . None of the patients showed the 997C > G mutation . The allelic variants of Q9UBK8 66A > G showed no significant association with total homocysteine ( tHcy ) levels , both in univariate analyses , and in a multivariate model controlling for age , gender , body mass index , renal function , time since transplantation , underlying kidney disease , as well as the P42898 677C > T/1298A > C genotypes . Similarly , no significant associations between the Q9UBK8 66A > Ggenotypes and plasma folate or Vitamin B(12) levels were found . In conclusion , Q9UBK8 66A > G has no major effect on tHcy , folate , or Vitamin B(12) plasma concentrations in kidney graft recipients .
