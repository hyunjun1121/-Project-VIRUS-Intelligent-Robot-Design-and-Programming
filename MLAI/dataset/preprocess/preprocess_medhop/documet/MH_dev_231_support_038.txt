PIKKs -- the solenoid nest where partners and kinases meet . The recent structure of a truncated P42345 in a complex with Q9BVC4 has provided a basic framework for understanding all of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -related kinases ( PIKKs ) : P42345 , Q13315 , ATR , Q96Q15 , Q9Y4A5 and DNA-PK . The PIKK kinase domain is encircled by the FAT domain , a helical solenoid that is present in all PIKKs . PIKKs also have an extensive helical solenoid N-terminal to the FAT domain for which there is limited structural information . This N-terminal helical solenoid is essential for binding proteins that associate with the PIKKs to regulate their activity and cellular localization .
