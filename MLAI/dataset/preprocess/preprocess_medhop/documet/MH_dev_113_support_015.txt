[ Role of neurokinin-1 receptor in lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the expression of neurokinin-1 receptor ( P25103 ) in the lung tissue , and the relationship between expression of P25103 and lung injury in rats with acute necrotizing pancreatitis ( P01160 ) . METHODS : One hundred and twenty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into P01160 and control groups . Animals in group P01160 were induced by the retrograde intraductal infusion of 5 % sodium taurocholate ( 0.1 ml/kg ) , and animals in normal control group received laparotomy only . The accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in lung tissues was measured with myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) assay . Lung endothelial barrier destruction was measured by lung capillary permeability ( LCP ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used to determine the mRNA expression of P25103 , western blot analysis was used to determine P25103 protein expression levels , and immunohistochemistry was used to localize expression site of P25103 . RESULTS : P25103 mRNA level was enhanced in the lung of P01160 compared with normal control group . Western blot analysis showed overexpression of P25103 protein level exited in P01160 group . Statistical analysis revealed correlation between P25103 mRNA and P05164 ( r=0.83 , P < 0.01 ) and LCP ( r=0.79 , P < 0.01 ) respectively . With immunohistochemistry staining , moderate to strong P25103 immunoreactivity was localized to alveolar membrane , I epithelium , II epithelium and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the lung of P01160 . CONCLUSION : In P01160 , overexpression of P25103 contributes to disturbance of neuropeptides loop , resulting in aggregation of neutrophilic granulocyte and promoting deterioration of lung injury .
