Expression of DB00171 receptors in the rat dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord . Extracellular purine nucleotides and nucleosides play important roles in the nervous system , e.g. , neurotransmission , neuromodulation , chemoattraction and acute inflammation . Extracellular nucleotides act through DB00171 receptors ( P2 receptors ) . P2 receptors are classified into two families : the P2X receptors are ionotropic ligand-gated ion channels and the P2Y receptors are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors . Currently , seven P2X receptors ( P51575 -7 ) and eight P2Y receptors ( P47900 , P41231 , P51582 , Q15077 , Q96G91 , Q9H244 , Q9BPV8 and Q15391 ) are recognized . In the sensory nervous system , DB00171 is suggested to be one of first mediators of tissue damage , which activates primary afferents . Nerve injury often leads to neuropathic pain , such as mechanical allodynia and painful responses to normally innocuous stimuli . Peripheral nerve injury induces the upregulation of molecules in activated microglia in the spinal cord . Microglia in the spinal cord may play an important role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain . A prominent signaling pathway in the development of neuropathic pain involves DB00171 acting on microglial purinergic receptors . This review focuses on the expression of P2X and P2Y receptors mRNAs in the pain transmission pathway , i.e. , in the dorsal root ganglion ( Q86YR7 ) and spinal cord . Furthermore , we suggest that the multiple microglial P2Y receptors activated by peripheral nerve injury may play a key role in the development of neuropathic pain .
