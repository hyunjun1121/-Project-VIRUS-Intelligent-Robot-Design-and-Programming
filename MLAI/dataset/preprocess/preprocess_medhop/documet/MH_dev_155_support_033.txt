MEK- P29323 signaling dictates DNA-repair gene P16455 expression and temozolomide resistance of stem-like glioblastoma cells via the Q00987 -p53 axis . Overcoming the resistance of glioblastoma cells against temozolomide , the first-line chemotherapeutic agent of choice for newly diagnosed glioblastoma , is a major therapeutic challenge in the management of this deadly brain tumor . The gene encoding O(6) -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( P16455 ) , which removes the methyl group attached by temozolomide , is often silenced by promoter methylation in glioblastoma but is nevertheless expressed in a significant fraction of cases and is therefore regarded as one of the most clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance against temozolomide . However , to date , signaling pathways regulating P16455 in P16455 -expressing glioblastoma cells have been poorly delineated . Here in this study , we provide lines of evidence that the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase ( MEK ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) -murine double minute 2 ( Q00987 ) -p53 pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of P16455 expression , using stem-like glioblastoma cells directly derived from patient tumor samples and maintained in the absence of serum , which not only possess stem-like properties but are also known to phenocopy the characteristics of the original tumors from which they are derived . We show that , in stem-like glioblastoma cells , MEK inhibition reduced Q00987 expression and that inhibition of either MEK or Q00987 resulted in p53 activation accompanied by p53-dependent downregulation of P16455 expression . MEK inhibition rendered otherwise resistant stem-like glioblastoma cells sensitive to temozolomide , and combination of MEK inhibitor and temozolomide treatments effectively deprived stem-like glioblastoma cells of their tumorigenic potential . Our findings suggest that targeting of the MEK- P29323 - Q00987 -p53 pathway in combination with temozolomide could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma .
