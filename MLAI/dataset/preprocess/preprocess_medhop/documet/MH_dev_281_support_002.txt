Dopamine-related genes and spontaneous smoking cessation in ever-heavy smokers . Several studies have provided evidence for associations of polymorphisms located in and near dopamine-related genes and nicotine dependence and other smoking-related phenotypes , including pharmacogenetic interactions . AIM : The purpose of the present work was to examine the association of SNPs in the P20711 ( DDC ) , dopamine receptor D2 ( P14416 ) and dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) genes with smoking cessation in a large retrospective study featuring approximately 900 cessation events . MATERIALS & METHODS : Data originated from the enrollment questionnaire of the epidemiological ESTHER study of community-dwelling adults aged 50-74 years , conducted in the German state of Saarland between July 2000 and December 2002 . Restricting the analyses to subjects who reported to have regularly smoked > 20 cigarettes per day at some point in their life , we used survival analysis methods to model the time from initiation of regular smoking to cessation ( defined as quitting with abstinence lasting until enrollment ) and its relation with eight polymorphisms in the aforementioned genes ( five in DDC , two in P14416 and one in Q01959 ) in 1446 participants . RESULTS : Neither individual variants nor DDC haplotypes were associated with the probability of overcoming nicotine dependence in this cohort . CONCLUSION : The repeated suggestion of associations between the variants examined and nicotine dependence in previous reports seems to contrast the negative results in the present study . This would appear consistent with the hypothesis that the establishment of regular heavy smoking might abolish associations between genetic determinants of nicotine dependence and nicotine dependence-related phenotypes , in particular the probability of successful smoking cessation .
