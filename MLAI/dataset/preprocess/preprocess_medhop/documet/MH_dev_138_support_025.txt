DB08860 up-regulates the induction of P35228 through enhanced stabilization of its mRNA in pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes . Studies have indicated that protective effects of statins ( P04035 inhibitor ) are associated with the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) or inducible NOS ( P35228 ) in heart and liver diseases . Statins have been reported to enhance hepatic NO production and decrease the vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis . However , it is unclear which NOS contributes to the increased NO production . We hypothesized that statins are involved in the up-regulation of P35228 in inflammatory liver , resulting in decreased hepatic resistance . Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1beta in the presence or absence of pitavastatin . Pretreatment of cells with pitavastatin resulted in up-regulation of P35228 induction by IL-1beta , followed by increased NO production . DB08860 had no effects on the degradation of IkappaB or activation of NF-kappaB . However , pitavastatin super-induced the up-regulation of type I IL-1 receptor ( IL-1RI ) , which is essential for P35228 induction in addition to the IkappaB/NF-kappaB pathway . Mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate blocked the stimulatory effects of pitavastatin on P35228 and IL-1RI induction . Transfection experiments revealed that pitavastatin increased the stability of P35228 mRNA rather than its promoter transactivation . In support of this observation , pitavastatin increased the antisense-transcript corresponding to the 3'-UTR of P35228 mRNA , which stabilizes P35228 mRNA by interacting with the 3'-UTR- and RNA-binding proteins . These findings demonstrate that pitavastatin up-regulates P35228 by the stabilization of its mRNA , presumably through the super-induction of IL-1RI and antisense-transcript . This implies that statins may contribute to a novel potentiated treatment in liver injuries including cirrhosis .
