Functional analysis of cis-acting elements regulating the alternative splicing of human P13569 exon 9 . The rate of exon 9 exclusion from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) mRNA is associated with monosymptomatic forms of cystic fibrosis . Exon 9 alternative splicing is modulated by a polymorphic polythymidine tract within its 3' splice site . We have generated a minigene carrying human P13569 exon 9 with its flanking intronic sequences and set up an in vivo model to study the cis-acting DNA elements which modulate its splicing . Transfections into human cell lines showed that T5 , but not P02786 or T7 alleles , significantly increases the alternative splicing of exon 9 . Moreover , we found that another polymorphic locus juxtaposed upstream of the T tract , and constituted by ( TG ) (n)repeats , can further modulate exon 9 skipping but only when activated by the T5 allele . Then , we extended our studies to the mouse P13569 exon 9 which does not show alternative splicing . Comparison of human and mouse introns 8 and 9 revealed a low homology between the two sequences and the absence of the human polymorphic loci within the mouse intron 3' splice site . We have tested a series of constructs where the whole human exon 9 with its flanking intronic sequences was replaced partially or completely by the murine counterpart . The transfections of these constructs in human and murine cell lines reveal that also sequences of the downstream intron 9 affect exon 9 definition and co-modulate , with the UG/U 3' splice site sequences , the extent of exon 9 skipping in P13569 mRNA .
