A critical role for P01344 in memory consolidation and enhancement . We report that , in the rat , administering insulin-like growth factor II ( P01344 , also known as P01344 ) significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting . Inhibitory avoidance learning leads to an increase in hippocampal expression of P01344 , which requires the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein β and is essential for memory consolidation . Furthermore , injections of recombinant P01344 into the hippocampus after either training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting . To be effective , P01344 needs to be administered within a sensitive period of memory consolidation . P01344 -dependent memory enhancement requires P01344 receptors , new protein synthesis , the function of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein and glycogen-synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) . Moreover , it correlates with a significant activation of synaptic GSK3β and increased expression of GluR1 ( also known as P42261 ) α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits . In hippocampal slices , P01344 promotes P11717 -dependent , persistent long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation . Thus , P01344 may represent a novel target for cognitive enhancement therapies .
