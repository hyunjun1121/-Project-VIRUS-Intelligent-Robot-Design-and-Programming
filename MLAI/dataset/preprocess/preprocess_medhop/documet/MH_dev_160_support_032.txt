[ Drug treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases : current status and prospects ] . The medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is dependent on disease activity and bowel involvement . Severe Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis are primarily treated with corticosteroids . Alternatively , if inflammation is localised in the right colon and ileum , budesonide may be used in view of its low systemic side effects . In distal colitis and perianal disease , topical therapy with steroids is very effective . In moderate disease preparations containing 5-aminosalicylate ( DB00244 ) may be used . The latter are highly effective applied locally in distal disease . Steroids should be tapered down and whenever possible not used to maintain remission . In patients with ulcerative colitis , DB00244 is effective in maintaining remission , whereas this medication plays only a limited role in Crohn 's disease . Refractory disease or patients with multiple flare-ups should be treated with azathioprine . DB00065 , an anti- P01375 antibody , is a potent therapy for fistulising Crohn 's disease or steroid-refractory disease . Other approved and experimental treatments are discussed .
