Differential effects of endotoxin and fibrinogen degradation products ( P14324 ) on liver synthesis of fibrinogen and albumin : evidence for the involvement of a novel monokine in the stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis induced by P14324 . 1. Administration of endotoxin or fibrinogen degradation products ( FDPs ) in rats increase fibrinogen synthesis comparable to that found during the acute phase response . 2 . An increased fibrinogen synthesis is also found in co-cultures of hepatocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon administration of endotoxin or FDPs , but not in primary cultures of hepatocytes alone . 3 . However , the increased synthesis of fibrinogen by FDPs is not accompanied by a decreased albumin synthesis , as in the case of stimulated fibrinogen synthesis induced by endotoxin in vivo and in co-cultures of hepatocytes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells , or induced by monocytic products in vivo and in primary cultures of hepatocytes alone . 4 . Since IL-1 and/or P05231 could not be accounted for the stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis without a decreased albumin synthesis , a novel monokine produced by mononuclear cells upon Q9NRC9 administration might be involved .
