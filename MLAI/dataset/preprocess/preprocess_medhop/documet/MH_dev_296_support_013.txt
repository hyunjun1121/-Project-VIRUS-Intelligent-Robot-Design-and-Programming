Opposing control of cannabinoid receptor stimulation on amyloid-beta-induced reactive gliosis : in vitro and in vivo evidence . Beside cytotoxic mechanisms impacting on neurons , amyloid beta ( A beta ) -induced astroglial activation is operative in Alzheimer 's disease brain , suggesting that persistent inflammatory response may have a role in the illness and that positive results may be achieved by curbing the astroglial reaction . Because the role of the endocannabinoid system could represent a promising field of research , the present study conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess this system . P13671 rat astroglioma cells were challenged with 1 microg/ml A beta 1-42 in the presence or absence of selective agonists and antagonists of cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors . Furthermore , rats were inoculated into the frontal cortex with 30 ng of A beta 1-42 and were i.p. administered with 5 mg/kg of the same substances . Immunohistochemical and biochemical findings revealed that selective agonism at P21554 and antagonism at CB2 receptors was able to blunt A beta-induced reactive astrogliosis with subsequent overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and P04271 protein . Moreover , A beta provoked down-regulation of P21554 receptors together with a reduction of anandamide concentration , whereas CB2 receptors were up-regulated and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol concentration was increased . Finally , to our knowledge , the current study is the first showing that interactions at cannabinoid receptors result in a dual regulation of A beta-induced reactive astrogliosis . The data support the assumption that compounds able to selectively block CB2 receptors may have therapeutic potential in controlling A beta-related pathology , due to their beneficial effects devoid of psychotropic consequences .
