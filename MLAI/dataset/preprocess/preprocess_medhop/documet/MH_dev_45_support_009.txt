Microarray analysis of cytokine activation of apoptosis pathways in the thyroid . It has been suggested that Fas-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases . Our previous studies have demonstrated that normal primary thyroid epithelial cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis , but the resistance can be overcome by pretreatment with a combination of interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) and IL-1beta . To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the P01579 /IL-1beta effects , we profiled changes in the transcription induced by these two cytokines in normal human thyroid cells , using cDNA microarrays . We found that P01579 /IL-1beta showed a significant increase in apoptosis-related genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , receptor-interacting protein 2 ( O43353 ) , and caspases 10 . These increases were confirmed by other methods , including real-time PCR and Western blot . Furthermore , the sensitization of primary thyroid epithelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by P01579 /IL-1beta was significantly blocked by a general caspase inhibitor , z-VAD , or by the combination of two specific individual caspase inhibitors . In addition , our results showed that P01579 /IL-1beta enhance p38 MAPK phosphorylation and that SB 203580 , a p38 MAPK inhibitor , can inhibit P01579 /IL-1beta-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation . SB 203580 also significantly prevented cytokine-induced P35228 expression and caspase activation and thus blocked Fas-mediated apoptosis of thyroid cells sensitized by P01579 /IL-1beta . In conclusion , our data suggest that both p38 MAPK and P35228 are involved in P01579 /IL-1beta-induced sensitization of the thyroid cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis via the activation of caspases 3 , 7 , and 10 and that this pathway may be further activated by P55957 . This hints that inflammatory cytokines regulate death-receptor-mediated apoptosis at multiple points in the process .
