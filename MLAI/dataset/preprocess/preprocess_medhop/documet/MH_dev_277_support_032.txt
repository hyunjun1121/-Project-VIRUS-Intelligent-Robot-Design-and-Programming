Effects of mitiglinide ( S 21403 ) on Kir6.2/ Q09428 , Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2B types of DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel . 1. We have investigated the mechanism of action of the novel anti-diabetic agent mitiglinide ( S 21403 ) on Kir6.2/ Q09428 , Kir6.2/SUR2A and Kir6.2/SUR2B types of DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channel . These possess a common pore-forming subunit , Kir6.2 , and different regulatory sulphonylurea receptor ( Q09428 ) subunits . It is believed that they correspond to native K( DB00171 ) channels in pancreatic beta-cells , heart and non-vascular smooth muscle , respectively . 2 . Kir6.2 was coexpressed with Q09428 , SUR2A or SUR2B in Xenopus oocytes and macroscopic currents were recorded in giant inside-out membrane patches . DB01252 was added to the intracellular membrane surface . 3 . DB01252 inhibited Kir6.2/ Q09428 currents at two sites : a low-affinity site on Kir6.2 and a high-affinity site on Q09428 . Low-affinity inhibition was similar for all three types of K( DB00171 ) channel but high-affinity inhibition was greater for Kir6.2/ Q09428 currents ( IC(50) , 4 nM ) than for Kir6.2/SUR2A or Kir6.2/SUR2B currents ( IC(50) , 3 and 5 microM , respectively ) . 4 . Inhibition of Kir6.2/ Q09428 currents was only slowly reversible on the time scale of electrophysiological experiments . 5 . Kir6.2/ Q09428 -S1237Y currents , which previously have been shown to lack high affinity tolbutamide inhibition , resembled Kir6.2/SUR2 currents in being unaffected by 100 nM but blocked by 10 microM mitiglinide . 6 . Our results show that mitiglinide is a high-affinity drug that shows a 1000 fold greater affinity for the beta-cell type than the cardiac and smooth muscle types of K( DB00171 ) channel , when measured in excised patches .
