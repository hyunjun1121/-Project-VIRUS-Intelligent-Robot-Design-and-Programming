Glutamatergic regulation of the p70S6 kinase in primary mouse neurons . Brief glutamatergic stimulation of neurons from fetal mice , cultured in vitro for 6 days , activates the P42345 -S6 kinase , P27361 /2 and Akt pathways , to an extent approaching that elicited by brain-derived neurotrophic factor . In contrast , sustained glutamatergic stimulation inhibits P29323 , Akt , and S6K . Glutamatergic activation of S6K is calcium/calmodulin-dependent and is prevented by inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 , phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase and by rapamycin . 2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid , an inhibitor of N'-methyl-D-aspartate receptors , abolishes glutamatergic activation of P27361 /2 but not the activation of P42345 -S6K ; the latter is completely abolished by inhibitors of voltage-dependent calcium channels . Added singly , dopamine gives slight , and norepinephrine a more significant , activation of P29323 and S6K ; both catecholeamines , however , enhance glutamatergic activation of S6K but not P29323 . After 12 days in culture , the response to direct glutamatergic activation is attenuated but can be uncovered by suppression of gamma-aminobutyric acid interneurons with bicuculline in the presence of the weak K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine ( DB06637 ) . This selective synaptic activation of P42345 -S6K is also resistant to APV and inhibited by Ca(2+) channel blockers and higher concentrations of glutamate . P13639 ( P13639 ) is phosphorylated and inhibited by the eEF2 kinase ( P62158 kinase III ) ; the latter is inhibited by the S6K or Rsk . DB11562 / DB06637 or DB00761 -induced depolarization reduces , whereas higher concentrations of glutamate increases , P13639 phosphorylation . Thus the P42345 -S6K pathway in neurons , a critical component of the late phase of LTP , is activated by glutamatergic stimulation in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent fashion through a calcium pool controlled by postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels , whereas sustained stimulation of extrasynaptic glutamate receptors is inhibitory .
