An evidence based therapeutic approach to hereditary and acquired angioedema . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Hereditary angioedema ( HAE ) due to P05155 ( DB05341 ) deficiency ( HAE- DB05341 ) , HAE with normal DB05341 , and acquired angioedema due to DB05341 deficiency are rare but important diseases that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality . Research into the pathogenesis of angioedema has expanded greatly and has led to new clinical trials with novel therapeutic agents and strategies . RECENT FINDINGS : Strategies for managing HAE- DB05341 are aimed at treating acute attacks or preventing attacks through the use of prophylactic treatment . Agents available in Europe for treating acute attacks include plasma-derived DB05341 concentrates , a bradykinin B2 receptor ( P30411 ) antagonist , and a recombinant human DB05341 . In the USA , a plasma-derived DB05341 concentrate , a bradykinin P30411 antagonist , and a plasma kallikrein inhibitor have been approved for the treatment of acute HAE- DB05341 attacks . DB05341 concentrates and attenuated androgens are used for short-term prophylactic treatment . Long-term prophylactic treatments include attenuated androgens , a plasma-derived DB05341 concentrate , and antifibrinolytics . Plasma-derived DB05341 and a bradykinin P30411 antagonist are approved for self-administration at home . SUMMARY : The number of management options for HAE- DB05341 and similar conditions has increased considerably within the last few years , thus helping to alleviate the burden of these rare diseases .
