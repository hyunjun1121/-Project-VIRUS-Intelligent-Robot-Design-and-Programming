DB00065 modifies mesenteric adipose tissue alterations and intestinal inflammation in rats with TNBS-induced colitis . OBJECTIVE : DB00065 is a monoclonal anti- P01375 -α antibody that is used therapeutically to treat Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines , especially P01375 -α , have been observed in the gastrointestinal tract of CD patients and were associated with alterations in the mesenteric adipose tissue , which also contributed to the high levels of adipokine release . The authors used a rat model of colitis that produces mesenteric adipose tissue alterations that are associated with intestinal inflammation to study the effects that infliximab treatment has on adipokine production , morphological alterations in adipose tissue and intestinal inflammation . MATERIAL AND METHODS : The ability of infliximab to neutralize rat P01375 -α was evaluated in vitro using U937 cells . Colitis was induced by repeated intracolonic trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid instillations and was evaluated by macroscopic score , histopathological analysis , myeloperoxidase activity , P01375 -α and P22301 expression as well as P35228 ( inducible NO synthase ) expression and JNK phosphorylation in colon samples . The alterations in adipose tissue were assessed by P01375 -α , P22301 , leptin , adiponectin and resistin levels as well as adipocyte size and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -γ expression . RESULTS : DB00065 treatment controlled intestinal inflammation , which reduced lesions and neutrophil infiltration . Inflammatory markers , such as P35228 expression and JNK phosphorylation , were also reduced . In mesenteric adipose tissue , infliximab increased the production of P22301 and resistin , which was associated with the restoration of adipocyte morphology and Q07869 -γ expression . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that infliximab could contribute to the control of intestinal inflammation by modifying adipokine production by mesenteric adipose tissue .
