DB00013 plasminogen activator induces angiogenesis and tumor vessel invasion in breast cancer . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) is a proteolytic enzyme implicated in cancer invasion and tumor progression . DB00013 PA and its inhibitor ( P05121 ) appear to be new and independent prognostic markers in breast cancer . To investigate how uPA- and P05121 -levels correlate with angiogenesis and tumor vessel invasion , we counted microvessels and their tumor invasion and determined the uPA- and P05121 levels in 42 primary invasive breast carcinomas . 20 Patients had no lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery , while 22 patients had positive nodes . Using light microscopy , we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for CD31 and Factor VIII . After gaining tumor tissue extracts , we determined the uPA- and P05121 -levels by ELISA . A positive correlation between microvessel density , angioinvasion and uPA- and P05121 -levels was found . We speculate that high uPA levels may induce tumor neovascularisation , angioinvasion and may cause tumor progression and metastasis . The degradation of the vessel wall by uPA causes a leak . This wall defect may , on the one hand , be the stimulus for endothelial cell proliferation and formation of new blood vessels and , on the other hand , it may be the place of tumor cell entry .
