P15121 regulates TGF-beta1-induced production of fibronectin and type IV collagen in cultured rat mesangial cells . AIM : To study the effects of aldose reductase ( AR ) on production of fibronectin and type IV collagen in rat mesangial cells ( MsC ) . METHODS : The vector , pcDNA3-AR , was constructed based on pET-15b-AR . Lipofect AMINE was used for stable transfection and G418 was used for selecting positive clones . DB02712 and zopolrestat were added for suppressing the activity of AR , respectively . The production of fibronectin and type IV collagen and the activation of Smads and MAPK signal transduction pathway were analysed by western blot and AP-1 activity was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) . RESULTS : The normal MsC showed increased expression of fibronectin and type IV collagen with stimulation of TGF-beta1 . Compared with the normal MsC , the MsC pre-incubated with Q9Y4X5 showed reduced expression ( P < 0.05 ) and the AR-transfected MsC showed increased expression ( P < 0.05 ) . The normal MsC showed activation of P29323 , JNK and p38 with stimulation of TGF-beta1 , while the activation of JNK and p38 was inhibited in the MsC pre-incubated with Q9Y4X5 and only the activation of JNK was enhanced in the AR-transfected MsC . The normal MsC showed enhanced AP-1 activity with the stimulation of TGF-beta1 , and similarly the activity was inhibited in the MsC pre-incubated with Q9Y4X5 and was more enhanced in the AR transfected MsC . CONCLUSION : AR can regulate the expression of fibronectin and type IV collagen with the stimulation of TGF-beta1 in MsC , which may have relations with the activation of JNK-MAPK and p38-MAPK signalling pathways and AP-1 .
