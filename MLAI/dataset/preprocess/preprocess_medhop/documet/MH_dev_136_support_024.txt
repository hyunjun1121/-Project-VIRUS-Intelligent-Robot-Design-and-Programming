A randomized phase I clinical and biologic study of two schedules of sorafenib in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia : a NCIC ( National Cancer Institute of Canada ) Clinical Trials Group Study . DB00398 is a small molecule inhibitor of RAF kinase , P35968 , c- P10721 , and P36888 . In this randomized phase I study , eligible patients had relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , and one prior induction regimen , or were age > 65 with untreated myelodysplastic syndrome ( P43034 ) or secondary AML . DB00398 was given orally for 28 days ( cont ) or 14 days ( int ) every 4 weeks at three dose levels ( 100 , 200 , and 400 mg P55957 ) ; 300 mg cont was also tested . Forty-two patients were enrolled ( median age 71 [ 37-82 ] ; prior chemotherapy : 22 ) . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was : 100 mg P55957 : 0/7 patients ; 200 mg P55957 : 2/12 patients ; 400 mg P55957 : 1/17 patients . DB00398 400 mg cont was not tolerated in this population : 6/8 received < 14 days of treatment due to toxicity ; no DLT was seen with 300 mg cont . One CR was seen in a patient with AML with P36888 -ITD . Flow cytometry studies suggest that sorafenib inhibits P29323 phosphorylation via c- P10721 . The recommended phase II dose in AML is 300 mg P55957 continuously , and testing in combination and in P36888 -ITD AML is warranted .
