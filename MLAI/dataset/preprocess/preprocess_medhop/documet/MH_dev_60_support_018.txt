Leukotriene B4 modulates in vivo expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by a receptor-mediated mechanism : regulation by lipoxin A4 . Leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) is a potent proinflammatory arachidonic acid metabolite whose actions are mediated by specific receptors . Recent characterization of a high-affinity LTB4 receptor on the surface of guinea pig P01730 + T lymphocytes prompted examination of a possible role of LTB4 in modulating in vivo expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) to tuberculin ( PPD ) . In the absence of PPD , intradermal injections of LTB4 or LTB4/ Q9Y271 antagonists did not elicit delayed-onset erythema at 24 h . When injected together with PPD , LTB4 ( 1 fmol to 1 pmol ) caused a significant 25 to 30 % decrease in DTH expression , whereas LTB4 receptor antagonists SC-41930 , LY-223982 , ONO-4057 ( 0.1-10 nmol ) , caused a highly significant ( P < .01 ) 25 to 50 % increase . The effect of SC-41930 on DTH expression was inhibited by a 10-fmol dose of LTB4 . Q9Y271 antagonist LY-171883 had no effect on DTH expression . Lipoxin A4 ( LXA4 ) interferes with binding of LTB4 to T lymphocytes or neutrophils by reducing LTB4 receptor density . It caused a small but significant enhancement of DTH expression at 1-nmol doses when injected with PPD . Lipoxin B4 had no effect . Enhancement or inhibition of grossly visible delayed skin responses to PPD by LTB4 . LTB4 receptor antagonists or LXA4 was not associated with qualitative or quantitative changes in superficial or deep dermal mononuclear cell infiltrates at the reaction site . We conclude that LTB4 modulates visible expression of DTH in vivo by a receptor-mediated mechanism .
