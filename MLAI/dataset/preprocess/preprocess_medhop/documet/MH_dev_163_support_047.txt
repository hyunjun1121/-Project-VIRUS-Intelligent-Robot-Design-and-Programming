A concise and efficient route to 2alpha-(omega-hydroxyalkoxy)-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvi tam in D3 : remarkably high affinity to vitamin D receptor . [ reaction : see text ] A convenient and potentially valuable synthetic approach to the novel 2alpha-functionalized 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ DB00136 ] derivatives ( 1a-c ) , which are the P06681 -epimer of ED-71 and its analogues , has been developed . The C2alpha-modified ring A precursors ( 1,7-enynes 16 , n = 0 , 1 , and 2 ) were constructed stereoselectively starting from D-glucose in high yield . In the synthesized 2alpha-(omega-hydroxyalkoxy)- DB00136 derivatives , 1a and 1b showed a greater binding affinity to vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , up to 1.8 times that of the native hormone .
