P04150 and sequential P04637 activation by dexamethasone mediates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells . Glucocorticoids play a pivotal role in the proliferation of osteoblasts , but the underlying mechanism has not been successfully elucidated . In this report , we have investigated the molecular mechanism which elucidates the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells . It was found that the inhibitory effects were largely attributed to apoptosis and P55008 phase arrest . Both the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were dependent on glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) , as they were abolished by GR blocker DB00834 pre-treatment and GR interference . P55008 phase arrest and apoptosis were accompanied with a p53-dependent up-regulation of P38936 and pro-apoptotic genes Q13794 and PUMA . We also proved that dexamethasone ca n't induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest when p53 was inhibited by p53 RNA interference . These data demonstrate that proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cell was significantly and directly inhibited by dexamethasone treatment via aberrant GR activation and subsequently P04637 activation .
