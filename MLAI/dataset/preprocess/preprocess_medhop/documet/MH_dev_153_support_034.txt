Neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 affects anxiety behaviour and expression of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor in adolescent rats . Early-life endocrine intervention may programme hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) expression and cause psychiatric disorders in later life . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) has been implicated in the regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioural responses , but it is yet to be determined whether and how neonatal P0C6A0 overexpression may modify hippocampal GR expression and thus programme adolescent behaviour in rats . Two-day old pups were injected intramuscularly with vacant plasmid ( VP ) or plasmid DNA encoding secretory P0C6A0 ( GP ) . Anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) test at 8 weeks of age . Plasma corticosterone levels were measured with enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) . Protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , respectively . The DNA methylation status of the GR exon 1(7) promoter was determined by bisulphate sequencing PCR ( BSP ) . GP rats exhibited anxiolytic behaviour compared with their VP counterparts . Hippocampal P43220 ( P43220 ) and GR mRNA expression were significantly elevated in GP rats without a significant difference in plasma corticosterone . Significant reduction in DNA methyltransferase 1 ( P26358 ) expression was observed in GP rats disconnected with alterations in DNA methylation of the GR exon 1(7) promoter . Nevertheless , mRNA expression of nerve growth factor-inducible protein A ( P18146 ) was significantly elevated in GP rats . These results suggest that neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding P0C6A0 affects anxiety behaviour in adolescent rats , probably through P18146 -activated upregulation of hippocampal GR expression .
