P10912 antagonists . Growth hormone ( GH ) has profound effects on vertebrate growth and cellular differentiation in diverse tissue types . Sexually dimorphic levels of circulating GH vary during development and throughout the lifespan . The synthesis and secretion of GH by the pituitary gland are precisely controlled . Abnormal levels are pathological ; hyposecretion in children results in dwarfism while hypersecretion results in acromegaly . This review provides an overview of GH and the GH/insulin-like growth factor ( DB01277 ) axis and highlights a P10912 antagonist ( i.e. Somavert(R) , pegvisomant ) . This antagonist competes with endogenous GH for the receptor and results in suppression of serum insulin-like growth factor ( DB01277 ) . DB00082 is important for the treatment of acromegaly and may have therapeutic implications for certain types of cancer and end organ damage due to diabetes .
