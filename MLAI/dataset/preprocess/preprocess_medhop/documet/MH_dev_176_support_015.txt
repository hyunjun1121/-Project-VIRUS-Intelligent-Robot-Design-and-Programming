The role of de novo ceramide synthesis in the mechanism of action of the tricyclic xanthate D609 . The cytotoxic effects of several chemotherapeutic drugs have been linked to elevated de novo ceramide biosynthesis . However , the relationship between the intracellular site(s) of ceramide accumulation and cytotoxicity is poorly understood . Here we examined the relationship between the site of ceramide deposition and inhibition of protein translation and induction of apoptosis by the antitumor/antiviral xanthate , D609 . In Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - P04264 , P29320 -293 , and NIH-3T3 cells , D609 caused rapid ( 1-5 min ) and sustained eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha ( eIF2alpha ) phosphorylation followed by apoptosis after 24 h . Concurrently , D609 stimulated de novo ceramide synthesis and increased ceramide mass 2-fold by 2 h in CHO- P04264 cells . In D609-treated CHO- P04264 cells , sphingomyelin synthesis was stimulated by brefeldin A , and P01031 - P28068 -ceramide transport to the Golgi apparatus was blocked , indicating ceramide accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . However , D609-mediated eIF2alpha phosphorylation , inhibition of protein synthesis , and apoptosis in CHO- P04264 cells were not attenuated by fumonisin B1 or l-cycloserine . Interestingly , short-chain ceramide promoted eIF2alpha phosphorylation and inhibited protein synthesis in CHO- P04264 cells , indicating that the effectiveness of endogenous ceramide could be limited by access to signaling pathways . Thus , expansion of the ER ceramide pool by D609 was not implicated in early ( eIF2alpha phosphorylation ) or late ( apoptotic ) cytotoxic events .
