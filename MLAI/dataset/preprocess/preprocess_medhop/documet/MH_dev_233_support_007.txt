Effects of an Engineered Anti- P04626 Antibody chA21 on Invasion of Human Ovarian Carcinoma Cell In Vitro . OBJECTIVE : HER-2 plays an important role in the development and progression of ovarian carcinoma . A number of monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) and engineered antibody fragments ( such as scFvs ) against the subdomain II or IV of HER-2 extracellular domain ( O95905 ) have been developed . We investigated the effect of chA21 , an engineered anti-HER-2 antibody that bind primarily to subdomain I , on ovarian carcinoma cell invasion in vitro , and explored its possible mechanisms . METHODS : Growth inhibition of SK-OV-3 cells was assessed using a Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay . The invasion ability of SK-OV-3 was determined by a Transwell invasion assay . The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) and its tissue inhibitors ( P16035 ) was detected by immunocytochemical staining , and the expression of p38 and the phosphorylation of p38 were assayed by both immunocytochemistry and Western blot . RESULTS : After treatment with chA21 , the invasion of human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells was inhibited in dose- and time-dependent manners . Simultaneously the expression of p38 , phospho-p38 , P08253 and the P08253 / P16035 ratio decreased , while P16035 expression increased . Additionally , the decrease in phospho-p38 was much greater than that of p38 . CONCLUSION : chA21 may inhibit SK-OV-3 cell invasion via the signal transduction pathway involving P08253 , P16035 , p38 and the activation of p38MAPK .
