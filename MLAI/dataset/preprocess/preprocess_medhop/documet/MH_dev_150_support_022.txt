Serum testosterone plays an important role in the metastatic ability of castration resistant prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Prostate cells are dependent on androgens for growth and proliferation . Androgen deprivation therapy is the recommended treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer . Under this therapy , prostate cancer will inevitably progress to castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Despite putative castration resistance , testosterone might still play a crucial role in the progression of CRPC . The goal of this study was to determine the role of testosterone in the formation of metastases of CRPC in both in vitro and in vivo settings . METHODS : In vitro , the effect of testosterone and the non-aromatizable androgen methyltrienolone on migration , invasion and proliferation of a castration-resistant prostate cancer rat cell line ( Dunning R3327-MATLyLu ) was assessed using a transwell assay and a sulforhodamine B assay and immunohistochemical detection of ki67 . P10275 status was determined using Western blot . In vivo , Copenhagen rats were divided in four groups ( males , females , castrated males and females with testosterone suppletion ) and inoculated with MATLyLu cells . Tumor size was assessed daily . RESULTS : DB00624 increased cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro . DB00624 did not affect in vitro cell proliferation . No difference was shown between the effect of testosterone and methyltrienolone . In vivo , in groups with higher levels of circulating testosterone , more rats had (micro)metastases compared with groups with low levels of testosterone . No effect was observed on primary tumor size/growth . CONCLUSIONS : Despite assumed castration resistance , progression of prostate cancer is still influenced by androgens . Therefore , continuous suppression of serum testosterone in patients who show disease progression during castration therapy is still warranted .
