Selective cleavage of SNAREs in sensory neurons unveils protein complexes mediating peptide exocytosis triggered by different stimuli . Oligomerisation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) complexes is required for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release . How these regulate the release of pain peptides elicited by different stimuli from sensory neurons has not been established . Herein , K(+) depolarization was found to induce multiple sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -resistant SNARE complexes in sensory neurons exposed to botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) , with molecular weights ranging from 104-288 k ( large ) to 38-104 k ( small ) . Isoform 1 of vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 ( VAMP 1 ) assembled into stable complexes upon depolarisation and was required for the participation of intact synaptosome-associated protein of relative molecular mass 25 k ( P60880 ) or DB00083 -truncated form ( P60880 -25A ) in the large functional and small inactive SDS-resistant SNARE complexes . Cleaving VAMP 1 decreased P60880 -25A in the functional complexes to a much greater extent than the remaining intact P60880 . Syntaxin 1 proved essential for the incorporation of intact and P60880 -25A into the large complexes . Truncation of syntaxin 1 by BoNT/C1 caused /A- and/or /C1-truncated P60880 to appear in non-functional complexes and blocked the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide ( P80511 ) elicited by capsaicin , ionomycin , thapsigargin or K(+) depolarization . Only the latter two were susceptible to /A . Inhibition of P80511 release by DB00083 was reversed by capsaicin and/or ionomycin , an effect overcome by BoNT/C1 . Unlike BoNT/B , BoNT/D cleaved VAMP 1 in addition to 2 and 3 in rat sensory neurons and blocked both P80511 and DB05875 release . Thus , unlike P60880 , syntaxin 1 and VAMP 1 are more suitable targets to abolish functional SNARE complexes and pain peptide release evoked by any stimuli .
