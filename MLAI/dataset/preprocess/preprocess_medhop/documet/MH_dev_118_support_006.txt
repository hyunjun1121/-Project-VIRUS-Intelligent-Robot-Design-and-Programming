Cantharidin inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing P15692 -induced P23458 / P40763 , P29323 and AKT signaling pathways . Cantharidin ( CTD ) , a chemical compound secreted by blister beetles , has been shown with anti-tumor property in many cancer cells . In this study , our data showed that CTD exerts potent anti-angiogenesis activity in a dose-dependent manner . CTD dose dependently suppressed human umbilical vascular endothelial cells proliferation , migration , and tube formation in vitro . Furthermore , CTD concentration dependently inhibited angiogenesis in chick embryo P62158 model in vivo . At the molecular level , CTD abrogated P15692 -induced activation of P40763 and suppressed the phosphorylation of P23458 and P29323 in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore , CTD blocked the phosphorylation of AKT in a time-dependent manner . Taken together , these findings clearly demonstrate for the first time that CTD can inhibit angiogenesis and may have applications in the development of new anti-angiogenesis drugs .
