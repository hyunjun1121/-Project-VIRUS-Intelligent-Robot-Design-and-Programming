DB00073 -dependent cytotoxicity by natural killer cells : influence of P08637 polymorphism on the concentration-effect relationship . The P08637 gene dimorphism generates two allotypes : FcgammaRIIIa-158V and FcgammaRIIIa-158F . The genotype homozygous for FcgammaRIIIa-158V ( VV ) is associated with higher clinical response to rituximab , a chimeric anti- P11836 IgG1 used in the treatment of B lymphoproliferative malignancies . Our objective was to determine whether this genetic association relates to rituximab-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by FcgammaRIIIa/CD16a+ cells . The number of CD16+ circulating monocytes , T cells , and natural killer ( NK ) cells in 54 donors was first shown to be unrelated to P08637 polymorphism . We then demonstrated that FcgammaRIIIa-158V displays higher affinity for rituximab than FcgammaRIIIa-158F by comparing rituximab concentrations inhibiting the binding of 3G8 mAb ( anti-CD16 ) with VV NK cells and NK cells homozygous for FcgammaRIIIa-158F ( FF ) . VV and FF NK cells killed Daudi cells similarly after FcgammaRIIIa engagement by saturating concentrations of rituximab or 3G8 . However , the rituximab concentration resulting in 50 % lysis ( EC(50) ) observed with NK cells from VV donors was 4.2 times lower than that observed with NK cells from FF donors ( on average 0.00096 and 0.00402 microg/ml , respectively , P = 0.0043 ) . Finally , the functional difference between VV and FF NK cells was restricted to rituximab concentrations weakly sensitizing P11836 . This study supports the conclusion that P08637 genotype is associated with response to rituximab because it affects the relationship between rituximab concentration and NK cell-mediated lysis of P11836 + cells . DB00073 administration could therefore be adjusted according to P08637 genotype .
