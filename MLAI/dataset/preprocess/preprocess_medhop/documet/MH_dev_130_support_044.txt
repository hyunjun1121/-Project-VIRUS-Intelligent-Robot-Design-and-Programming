Biologic therapies in psoriasis : a new therapeutic approach . Chronic plaque psoriasis is an immune-mediated , inflammatory skin disease with a heavy burden on quality of life of patients . The disease has a chronic relapsing course and may be life long . Comorbid disorders include psoriatic arthritis , obesity , dyslipidemia , hypertension and an increased rate of cardiovascular disease . Conventional systemic treatments include methotrexate , cyclosporine and acitretin , which are associated with end organ toxicity that precludes long term therapy . Biological drugs are designed to selectively interfere with the immune mechanisms that induce psoriasis . DB00095 is effective for skin psoriasis but not psoriatic arthritis . Anti- P01375 agents ( etanercept , infliximab and adalimumab ) are active on both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . DB00065 is the most effective and rapid agent , but its safety profile may be less favourable . Moreover , efficacy can reduce over time . DB00005 is moderately active but has a better safety profile , and can be discontinued and re-used without loss of efficacy . The long term safety of all these agents has not been established .
