Pharmacogenetics and future therapeutic scenarios : what affects the prediction of response to treatment with etanercept ? There are five tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -α ) inhibitors available for clinical use that have demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-inflammatory or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases . These include the anti- P01375 -α monoclonal antibodies infliximab , adalimumab , DB06674 , and certolizumab pegol , and the fusion protein , etanercept . The use of pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to increase drug efficiency by identifying genetic factors responsible for a lack of response to , or toxicities from , P01375 -α inhibitors , and could be used to individualize therapy . Several studies have reported associations between genetic polymorphisms and the response to etanercept , but most are small and insufficiently powered to detect effect , and markers tend to be more prognostic than predictive of therapeutic response . Limitations of pharmacogenetic studies include the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , genes in linkage with other loci , interaction of environmental factors , and cohort heterogeneity , all of which can complicate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and treatment response . Further studies are needed for pharmacogenetics to become a routine part of daily clinical therapeutic practice .
