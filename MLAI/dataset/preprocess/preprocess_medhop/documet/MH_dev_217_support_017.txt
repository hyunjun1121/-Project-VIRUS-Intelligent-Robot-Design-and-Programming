Mixed modeling of meta-analysis P-values ( MixMAP ) suggests multiple novel gene loci for low density lipoprotein cholesterol . Informing missing heritability for complex disease will likely require leveraging information across multiple SNPs within a gene region simultaneously to characterize gene and locus-level contributions to disease phenotypes . To this aim , we introduce a novel strategy , termed Mixed modeling of Meta-Analysis P-values ( MixMAP ) , that draws on a principled statistical modeling framework and the vast array of summary data now available from genetic association studies , to test formally for locus level association . The primary inputs to this approach are : ( a ) single SNP level p-values for tests of association ; and ( b ) the mapping of SNPs to genomic regions . The output of MixMAP is comprised of locus level estimates and tests of association . In application of MixMAP to summary data from the Global Lipids Gene Consortium , we suggest twelve new loci ( Q16512 , P02751 , P22309 , P37231 , DMDGH , Q03181 , Q00534 , Q7Z7G8 , Q05329 , Q9UQC2 , P02749 and O15118 ) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease and we also demonstrate the potential utility of MixMAP in small data settings . Overall , MixMAP offers novel and complementary information as compared to SNP-based analysis approaches and is straightforward to implement with existing open-source statistical software tools .
