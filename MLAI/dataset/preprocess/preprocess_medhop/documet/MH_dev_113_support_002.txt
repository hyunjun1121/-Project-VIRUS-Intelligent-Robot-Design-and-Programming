An improved effect size for single-case research : nonoverlap of all pairs . Nonoverlap of All Pairs ( Q8WYA6 ) , an index of data overlap between phases in single-case research , is demonstrated and field tested with 200 published AB contrasts . Q8WYA6 is a novel application of an established effect size known in various forms as Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) , the Common Language Effect Size ( CL ) , the Probability of Superiority ( PS ) , the Dominance Statistic ( DS ) , Mann-Whitney 's U , and Sommers D , among others . Q8WYA6 was compared with 3 other non-overlap-based indices : P01160 ( percent of nonoverlapping data ) , P15941 ( percent of data points exceeding the median ) , and PAND ( percent of all nonoverlapping data ) , as well as Pearson 's R(2) . Five questions were addressed about Q8WYA6 : ( a ) typical Q8WYA6 values , ( b ) its ability to discriminate among typical single-case research results , ( c ) its power and precision ( confidence interval width ) , ( d ) its correlation with the established effect size index , R(2) , and ( e ) its relationship with visual judgments . Results were positive , the new index equaling or outperforming the other overlap indices on most criteria .
