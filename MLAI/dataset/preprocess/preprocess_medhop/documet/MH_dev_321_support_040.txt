In vitro cell death of activated lymphocytes in Omenn 's syndrome . Omenn 's syndrome ( OS ) is characterized by erythrodermia , hepatosplenomegaly , lymphadenopathy , hypereosinophilia and elevated IgE levels associated with increased susceptibility to severe infections . Peripheral blood T cells , though usually present in normal number , show an activated phenotype ( including an increased expression of CD95/Fas ) , a Th2 pattern of cytokine secretion and defective proliferative response to mitogens . In this report , we demonstrate that T cells from patients with OS undergo an excessive cell death in vitro resulting from two mechanisms . First , a substantial number of peripheral blood lymphocytes from OS patients die in unstimulated cultures ( p = 0.009 vs. healthy controls ) . This spontaneous apoptosis is associated with reduced expression of bcl-2 gene product ( p < 0.05 ) and can be prevented by addition of interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( which also prevents down-modulation of bcl-2 ) , while is independent from CD95 signaling . Second , lymphocytes from OS patients are highly susceptible to activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) induced with mitogens . This mechanism is largely independent from P60568 , while it can be significantly inhibited blocking CD95 with an IgG2b monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) . The dependence of AICD from signals transduced via CD95 was confirmed showing that cross-linking CD95 with an IgM mAb induces a higher cell death in purified P01730 + CD45R0+ cells from OS patients than in controls ( comparable for CD95 expression ) . Both mechanisms of cell death observed in this study result from lymphocyte hyperactivation occurring in vivo in these patients and may contribute to functional T cell defects of OS .
