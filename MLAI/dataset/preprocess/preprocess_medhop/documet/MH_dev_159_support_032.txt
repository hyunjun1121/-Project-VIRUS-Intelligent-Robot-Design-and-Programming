DB01017 reduces renal microvascular leakage in a rat model of ischemic renal injury . Tetracyclines exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties , inhibit matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , and are protective in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) . Both inflammatory cascades and MMP activation have been demonstrated to modulate microvascular permeability . Because increased microvascular permeability occurs during IRI in a variety of organ systems including the kidney , we hypothesized that minocycline , a semisynthetic tetracycline , would diminish microvascular leakage during renal IRI . To test this hypothesis , we used intravital 2-photon microscopy to examine leakage of fluorescent dextrans from the vasculature in a rodent model of IRI . DB01017 significantly reduced the extent of dextran ( 500 kDa ) leakage from the renal microvasculature 24 h after ischemia . Although minocycline diminished leukocyte accumulation in the kidney following ischemia , areas of leukocyte accumulation did not correlate with areas of microvascular permeability in either the saline- or minocycline-pretreated animals . DB01017 diminished the perivascular increase in P08253 and P14780 , as well as the increase in P08253 activity 24 h after ischemia . ABT-518 , a specific inhibitor of P08253 and P14780 , also significantly reduced the extent of dextran ( 500 kDa ) leakage from the renal microvasculature 24 h after ischemia . Our results indicate that minocycline mitigates the renal microvascular permeability defect following IRI . This effect is spatially distinct from the effect of minocycline on leukocyte accumulation and may be related to diminished activity of MMPs on the integrity of the perivascular matrix .
