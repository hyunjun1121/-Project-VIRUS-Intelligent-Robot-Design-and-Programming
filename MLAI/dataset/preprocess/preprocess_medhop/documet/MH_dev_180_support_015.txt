Localization of the vasopressin V1a and V2 receptors within the renal cortical and medullary circulation . DB00067 ( AVP ) is a potent vasoconstrictor that preferentially reduces renal medullary blood flow through the stimulation of the vasopressin V1a receptor ( P37288 ) . Studies have also shown that the vasopressin V2 receptor ( P30518 ) may modulate AVP-mediated vasoconstriction . At present , the distribution of the P37288 and P30518 within the renal cortical and medullary microcirculation has not been determined . This study was designed to localize the transcriptional and translational sites of the P37288 and P30518 in microdissected intrarenal vascular segments from both the cortex and medulla , specifically the interlobar , arcuate , and interlobular arteries ; afferent and efferent arterioles ; glomeruli ; and single outer medullary vasa recta capillaries using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses . The results indicated that P37288 mRNA and proteins were present in the isolated cortical or medullary vasculature , but the P30518 mRNA and proteins were not found . This study suggests that the vasoconstrictor action of AVP within the renal medulla is mediated through the P37288 and that the modulatory P30518 -mediated vasodilation is probably through the release of paracrine hormones found within the renal interstitial or tubular cells .
