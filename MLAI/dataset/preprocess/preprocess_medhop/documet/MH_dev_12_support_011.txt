Dopamine receptors and psychiatric drug treatment . The established antipsychotic drugs act mainly by antagonizing dopamine mediated synaptic transmission in the brain . Increase in the rate of production of dopamine metabolites as well as the firing rate of dopamine-containing neurons can be interpreted as compensatory responses to an interruption of synaptic transmission at dopamine nerve terminals . The demonstration of involvement of limbic and cortical mechanisms in the antipsychotic activity of neuroleptic drugs is far more difficult than the involvement of nigro-striatal and tubero-infundibular mechanisms in the neurological and neuroendocrine effects of these drugs . Application of radioreceptor techniques to dopamine research has supported the findings obtained by other neuropsychopharmacological research techniques , providing more direct evidence of dopamine receptor blockade by neuroleptic drugs . Further research is needed especially in studying the nature of the time-dependent adaptive changes at the receptor sites as well as the differences between the different dopamine projections and neural systems in the brain . The different subtypes of dopamine receptors in the brain , currently called D1 and D2 dopamine receptors , seem to be parallel , although in many respects independently-acting regulatory systems . P14416 -selective antagonists such as sulpiride seem to cause selective D2 receptor up-regulation . P01236 secretion seems to be regulated by D2 dopamine receptors . The exact physiological role of D1 dopamine receptors as well as the clinical consequences of selective D1 antagonism is not known . DB00391 and clozapine are examples of atypical neuroleptic compounds that have quite different profile of action , the former having strong and selective antidopaminergic action , the latter combining a number of non- dopaminergic mechanisms with rather slight effects on dopamine receptors.
