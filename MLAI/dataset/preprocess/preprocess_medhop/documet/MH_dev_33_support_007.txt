Immunoregulatory natural killer cells suppress autoimmunity by down-regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice . Natural killer ( NK ) cells belong to the innate immune system . Besides their role in antitumor immunity , NK cells also regulate the activity of other cells of the immune system , including dendritic cells , macrophages , and T cells , and may , therefore , be involved in autoimmune processes . The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of NK cells within this context . Using two mouse models for type 1 diabetes mellitus , a new subset of NK cells with regulatory function was identified . These cells were generated from conventional NK cells by incubation with Q14116 and are characterized by the expression of the surface markers CD117 ( also known as c-Kit , stem cell factor receptor ) and programmed death ( PD ) -ligand 1 . In vitro analyses demonstrated a direct lysis activity of Q14116 -stimulated NK cells against activated insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells in a P18621 /PD-ligand 1-dependent manner . Flow cytometry analyses revealed a large increase of splenic and lymphatic NK1.1(+)/c-Kit(+) NK cells in nonobese diabetic mice at 8 wk of age , the time point of acceleration of adaptive cytotoxic immunity . Adoptive transfer of unstimulated and Q14116 -stimulated NK cells into streptozotocin-treated mice led to a delayed diabetes development and partial disease prevention in the group treated with Q14116 -stimulated NK cells . Consistent with these data , mild diabetes was associated with increased numbers of NK1.1(+)/c-Kit(+) NK cells within the islets . Our results demonstrate a direct link between innate and adaptive immunity in autoimmunity with newly identified immunoregulatory NK cells displaying a potential role as immunosuppressors .
