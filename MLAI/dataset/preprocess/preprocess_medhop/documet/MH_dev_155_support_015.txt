Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase regulates collagen-dependent mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-related kinase activation and cell migration . Mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) kinase 1 ( Q02750 ) / P29323 signaling has been implicated in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Migration of HT1080 cells on type I collagen was suppressed by the matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) inhibitors BB94 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( P01033 ) -2 but not by P01033 . P16035 -specific inhibition suggests that membrane type 1 MMP ( P50281 ) is likely involved in this process . Activation of P29323 was induced in HT1080 cells adhered on dishes coated with type I collagen , and this was inhibited by BB94 . P08253 processing in HT1080 cells , which also was stimulated by cultivation on type I collagen , was inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 . Expression of a constitutively active form of Q02750 promoted P08253 processing concomitant with the increase of P50281 levels , suggesting that P50281 is regulated by MEK/ P29323 signaling . In addition , expression of the hemopexin-like domain of P50281 in HT1080 cells interfered with P08253 processing , P29323 activation , and cell migration , implying that the enzymatic activity of P50281 is involved in collagen-induced P29323 activation , which results in enhanced cell migration . Thus , adhesion of HT1080 cells to type I collagen induces P50281 -dependent P29323 activation , which in turn causes an increase in P50281 levels and subsequent cell migration .
