The thyroid hormone receptor Î² induces DNA damage and premature senescence . There is increasing evidence that the thyroid hormone ( TH ) receptors ( THRs ) can play a role in aging , cancer and degenerative diseases . In this paper , we demonstrate that binding of TH DB00279 ( triiodothyronine ) to P10828 induces senescence and deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage in cultured cells and in tissues of young hyperthyroid mice . DB00279 induces a rapid activation of Q13315 ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) /PRKAA ( adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ) signal transduction and recruitment of the NRF1 ( nuclear respiratory factor 1 ) and P10828 to the promoters of genes with a key role on mitochondrial respiration . Increased respiration leads to production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species , which in turn causes oxidative stress and DNA double-strand breaks and triggers a DNA damage response that ultimately leads to premature senescence of susceptible cells . Our findings provide a mechanism for integrating metabolic effects of THs with the tumor suppressor activity of P10828 , the effect of thyroidal status on longevity , and the occurrence of tissue damage in hyperthyroidism .
