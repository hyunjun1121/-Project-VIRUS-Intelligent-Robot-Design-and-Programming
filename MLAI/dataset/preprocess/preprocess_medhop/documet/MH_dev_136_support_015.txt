Nerve growth factor activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway is modulated by Ca(2+) and calmodulin . Nerve growth factor is a member of the neurotrophin family of trophic factors that have been reported to be essential for the survival and development of sympathetic neurons and a subset of sensory neurons . Nerve growth factor exerts its effects mainly by interaction with the specific receptor TrkA , which leads to the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways . Once activated , TrkA also allows for a rapid and moderate increase in intracellular calcium levels , which would contribute to the effects triggered by nerve growth factor in neurons . In this report , we analyzed the relationship of calcium to the activation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells . We observed that calcium and calmodulin are both necessary for the acute activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases after TrkA stimulation . We analyzed the elements of the pathway that lead to this activation , and we observed that calmodulin antagonists completely block the initial P04049 activation without affecting the function of upstream elements , such as Ras , Grb2 , Shc , and Trk . We have broadened our study to other stimuli that activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases through tyrosine kinase receptors , and we have observed that calmodulin also modulates the activation of such kinases after epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation in PC12 cells and after TrkB stimulation in cultured chicken embryo motoneurons . P62158 seems to regulate the full activation of P04049 after Ras activation , since functional Ras is necessary for P04049 activation after nerve growth factor stimulation and calmodulin-Sepharose is able to precipitate P04049 in a calcium-dependent manner .
