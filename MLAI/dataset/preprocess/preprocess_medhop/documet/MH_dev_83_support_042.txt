[ Selective inhibitors of type 2 cyclooxygenase : less renal effects than the classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ] . Prostaglandins play an important role in the regulation of renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion . Thus , the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) induces a renal vasoconstriction and sodium and potassium retention . In some high risk patients , this may lead to acute renal failure . The anti-inflammatory and renal effects of conventional NSAIDs are mediated by the non-selective inhibition of two cyclo-oxygenases , P23219 and P35354 . Recently , highly selective P35354 inhibitors have been developed such as celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) . These drugs were designed to preserve the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs while reducing their gastro-intestinal and renal side effects . Selective P35354 inhibitors have indeed less gastro-intestinal side-effects . However , their renal profile is comparable to that of non-selective inhibitors as they induce a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and a sodium and potassium retention . Thus , despite the good gastro-intestinal safety profile of selective P35354 , one should be careful with the use of these agents in high risk patients as they may induce similar renal complications as non-selective NSAIDs .
