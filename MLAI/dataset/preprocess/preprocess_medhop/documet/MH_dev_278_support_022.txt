Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and Q9H244 receptor antagonists yield additive inhibition of platelet aggregation , granule secretion , soluble P29965 release and procoagulant responses . Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ( P08514 /IIIa ) antagonists , including abciximab and tirofiban , are administered concurrently with clopidogrel , a Q9H244 antagonist , and aspirin in some patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention . We studied the effects of , and interactions between , abciximab , tirofiban , aspirin and the Q9H244 antagonist cangrelor on platelet aggregation , alpha and dense granule secretion and procoagulant responses in vitro . Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers . Platelet aggregation , dense granule secretion , alpha granule secretion ( P05121 and soluble P29965 levels ) and procoagulant responses ( annexin-V and microparticle formation ) were assessed using collagen and thrombin receptor activating peptide ( TRAP ) as agonists . All the antagonists used singularly inhibited collagen-induced responses . Combinations of abciximab or tirofiban with aspirin and/or cangrelor gave additive inhibition with the greatest effect seen when abciximab or tirofiban was combined with both aspirin and cangrelor . DB06441 inhibited TRAP-induced responses and , again , there was additive inhibition of these parameters when abciximab or tirofiban were combined with cangrelor . The P08514 /IIIa receptor plays an important role in amplification of platelet activation such that there are important interactions between P08514 /IIIa antagonists and inhibitors of both Q9H244 receptor activation and , to a lesser extent , thromboxane A2 generation . These interactions are likely to have important influences on the safety and efficacy of combination anti-platelet therapies .
