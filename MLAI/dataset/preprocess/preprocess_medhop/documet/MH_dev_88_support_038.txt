DB00082 treatment in gigantism caused by a growth hormone-secreting giant pituitary adenoma . BACKGROUND : Gigantism is rare with the majority of cases caused by a growth hormone ( GH ) -secreting pituitary adenoma . Treatment options for GH-secreting pituitary adenomas have been widened with the availability of long-acting dopamine agonists , depot preparations of somatostatin analogues , and recently the P10912 antagonist pegvisomant . CASE REPORT : A 23-year-old male patient presented with continuous increase in height during the past 6 years due to a GH-secreting giant pituitary adenoma . Because of major intracranial extension and failure of octreotide treatment to shrink the tumour , the tumour was partially resected by a trans-frontal surgical approach . At immunohistochemistry , the tumour showed a marked expression of GH and a sparsely focal expression of prolactin . Somatostatin receptors ( sst ) 1-5 were not detected . Tumour tissue weakly expressed dopamine receptor type 2 . The Gs alpha subunit was intact . Conversion from somatostatin analogue to pegvisomant normalized insulin-like-growth-factor-I ( P05019 ) levels and markedly improved glucose tolerance . CONCLUSION : DB00082 is a potent treatment option in patients with pituitary gigantism . In patients who do not respond to somatostatin analogues , knowledge of the P61278 receptor status may shorten the time to initiation of pegvisomant treatment .
