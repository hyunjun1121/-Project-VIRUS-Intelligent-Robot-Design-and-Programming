Effects of serotonin and serotonergic agonists and antagonists on the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 . Serotonin ( 5-HT ) is a neurotransmitter and an immune modulator . In vitro , antidepressants with a serotonergic mode of action have , at concentrations within the therapeutical range , negative immunoregulatory effects , i.e. , they increase the production rate of interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) , a negative immunoregulatory cytokine . We have hypothesized that part of these effects may be explained by the serotonergic activities of antidepressants on immunocytes . This study was carried out to examine the effects of 5-HT , p-chlorophenylalanine ( PCPA ) , a 5-HT depleting agent , flesinoxan ( a P08908 agonist ) , m-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP ; a 5- Q13049 /2C agonist ) , and ritanserin ( a 5- Q13049 /2C antagonist ) on the production rate of interferon-gamma ( IFNgamma ) , a proinflammatory cytokine , and P22301 by whole blood stimulated with polyclonal activators . The IFNgamma/ P22301 production ratio was computed , since this ratio reflects the pro- versus anti-inflammatory capacity of cultured whole blood . We found that : 1 ) 5-HT , 150 ng/mL , 1.5 microg/mL , and 15 microg/mL significantly decreased the IFNgamma/ P22301 ratio ; 2 ) PCPA ( 5 microM ) significantly suppressed the production of IFNgamma and P22301 ; 3 ) flesinoxan ( 15 ng/mL ; 1.5 microg/mL ) had no significant effects on the production of the above cytokines ; and 4 ) mCPP ( 2.7 microg/mL ) and ritanserin ( 5.0 microg/mL ) suppressed the IFNgamma/ P22301 ratio . It is concluded that intracellular 5-HT may be necessary for an optimal synthesis of IFNgamma and P22301 , and that extracellular 5-HT concentrations at or above serum values may suppress the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFNgamma . The negative immunoregulatory effects of antidepressive drugs are probably not related to their serotonergic activities .
