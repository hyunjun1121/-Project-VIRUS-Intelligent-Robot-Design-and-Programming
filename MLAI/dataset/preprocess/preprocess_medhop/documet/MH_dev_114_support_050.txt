P00747 activator inhibitor-1 supports P10145 -mediated neutrophil transendothelial migration by inhibition of the constitutive shedding of endothelial P10145 /heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes . The endothelium is the primary barrier to leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation . Neutrophil recruitment is directed by transendothelial gradients of P10145 that , in vivo , are bound to the endothelial cell surface . We have investigated the identity and function of the binding site(s) in an in vitro model of neutrophil transendothelial migration . In endothelial culture supernatants , P10145 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 . Constitutive shedding of P10145 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of P10145 . Increased shedding of P10145 /heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration , and aprotinin , a potent plasmin inhibitor , reversed this inhibition . Platelets , added as an exogenous source of P05121 , had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration . Our results indicate that P10145 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains , and that plasmin , generated by endothelial plasminogen activator , induces the shedding of this form of P10145 . P05121 appears to stabilize the chemoattractant form of P10145 at the cell surface and may represent a therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory strategies .
