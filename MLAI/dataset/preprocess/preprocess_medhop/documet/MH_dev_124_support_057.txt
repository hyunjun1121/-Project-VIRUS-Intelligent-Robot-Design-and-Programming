[ Genetic basis for skeletal disease. Hereditary rickets ] . Hereditary rickets is caused by inborn error of vitamin D activation , vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) function or increased urinary phosphate excretion . Loss-of-function mutation of 1alpha-hydroxylase gene and loss-of-function mutation of P11473 gene result in vitamin D-dependent rickets type I and type II , respectively . X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) is the most common type of hypophosphatemic rickets , and autosomal dominant ( P30518 ) and negative ( ARHR ) types are rare . The diagnosis may be sometimes difficult and increasing cases of vitamin D deficiency must be distinguished .
