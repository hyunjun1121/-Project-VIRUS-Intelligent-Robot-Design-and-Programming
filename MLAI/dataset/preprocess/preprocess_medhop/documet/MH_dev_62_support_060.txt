Strategies for targeting tumour necrosis factor in Q9UKU7 . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) plays an important role in mediating the inflammation of inflammatory bowel disease , in particular , Crohn 's disease . Strategies aimed at reducing tumour necrosis factor in patients with inflammatory bowel disease include the mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab , the humanized monoclonal antibody CDP571 , the human soluble P01375 p55 receptor onercept , the human monoclonal antibody D2E7 ( adalimumab ) , the anti- P01375 human antibody Fab ' fragment-polyethelene glycol ( PEG ) conjugate DB08904 , and the small molecules thalidomide and CNI-1493 ( Q96HU1 -kinase inhibitor ) . DB00065 is effective for treating active Crohn 's disease , maintaining remission , closing fistulas , maintaining fistula closure , and treating ankylosing spondylitis . DB00065 is also being investigated for the treatment of ulcerative colitis . Side-effects occurring in patients treated with infliximab include human anti-chimeric antibodies , infusion reactions , delayed hypersensitivity reactions , formation of autoantibodies , and , in rare circumstances , drug-induced lupus and serious infections , including tuberculosis . CDP571 is effective for treating active Crohn 's disease , steroid sparing , and possibly for closing fistulas and maintaining remission . Side-effects occurring in patients treated with CDP571 include anti-idiotype antibodies , infusion reactions and the formation of autoantibodies . A controlled trial of etanercept in patients with Crohn 's disease was negative . Pilot studies with onercept , thalidomide , and CNI-1493 have suggested benefit for Crohn 's disease . There are no published data on the efficacy of adalimumab ( D2E7 ) or DB08904 for either Crohn 's disease or ulcerative colitis . Anti-tumour necrosis factor therapies are effective for the treatment of Crohn 's disease and are being investigated for ulcerative colitis .
