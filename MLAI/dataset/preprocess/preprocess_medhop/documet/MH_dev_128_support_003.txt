Differential gene expression in relation to the clinical characteristics of human brain arteriovenous malformations . Arteriovenous malformations ( AVMs ) of the central nervous system are considered as congenital disorders . They are composed of abnormally developed dilated arteries and veins and are characterized microscopically by the absence of a capillary network . We previously reported DNA fragmentation and increased expression of apoptosis-related factors in AVM lesions . In this article , we used microarray analysis to examine differential gene expression in relation to clinical manifestations in 11 AVM samples from Japanese patients . We categorized the genes with altered expression into four groups : death-related , neuron-related , inflammation-related , and other . The death-related differentially expressed genes were P14780 , P15018 , P04179 , Q16548 , P39900 , and P17066 . The neuron-related genes were P01303 , P06702 , Q15784 , S100Abeta , Q9UQM7 , Q8TBG9 , P08172 , and Q8NCB2 . The inflammation-related genes were PTX3 , P10145 , P05231 , P02778 , P32455 , P20309 , P09341 , P27930 , P55774 , and Q99616 . In addition , we compared gene expression in those with or without clinical characteristics including deep drainer , embolization , and high-flow nidus . We identified a small number of genes . Using these microarray data we are able to generate and test new hypotheses to explore AVM pathophysiology . Microarray analysis is a useful technique to study clinical specimens from patients with brain vascular malformations .
