DB00107 predominantly excites putative oxytocin neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus in vitro . To determine the oxytocin ( P01178 ) sensitivity of neurons in the supraoptic nucleus ( P18583 ) , extracellular recordings were made from the rat hypothalamic slice preparation . P01178 added to the bathing medium ( 3 X 10(-7) M ) excited 13 ( 93 % ) of 14 cells which fired continuously ( average 4.9 +/- 0.7 spikes/s ) and 26 ( 81 % ) of 32 cells which fired slowly and irregularly ( average 1.4 +/- 0.4 spikes/s ) . By contrast , only 2 ( 8 % ) of 26 phasically firing neurons were excited and none of the P18583 cells tested were inhibited . The excitation was reversibly antagonized by a synthetic P01178 analogue , 1-deamino- [ 2-(O-methyltyrosine) , 4-valine , 8-D-arginine ] vasopressin . The results suggest that P01178 exerts predominantly excitatory effects in the P18583 and that putative P01178 cells are more likely to be affected than putative vasopressin cells .
