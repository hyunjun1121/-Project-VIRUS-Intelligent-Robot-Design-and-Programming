Coexpression of P49771 and GM- P04141 genes modulates immune responses induced by P04626 /neu DNA vaccine . DNA vaccine and dendritic cells ( DCs ) -based vaccine have emerged as promising strategies for cancer immunotherapy . P36888 -ligand ( P49771 ) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) have been exploited for the expansion of DC . It was reported previously that combination of plasmid encoding GM- P04141 with P04626 /neu DNA vaccine induced predominantly P01730 (+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immune response . In this study , we investigated the modulation of immune responses by murine P49771 and GM- P04141 , which acted as genetic adjuvants in the forms of bicistronic ( pFLAG ) and monocistronic ( pFL and pGM ) plasmids for P04626 /neu DNA vaccine ( pN-neu ) . Coexpression of P49771 and GM- P04141 significantly enhanced maturation and antigen-presentation abilities of splenic DC . Increased numbers of infiltrating DC at the immunization site , higher interferon-gamma production , and enhanced cytolytic activities by splenocytes were prominent in mice vaccinated with pN-neu in conjunction with pFLAG . Importantly , a potent CD8(+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity against bladder tumors naturally overexpressing P04626 /neu was induced in the vaccinated mice . Collectively , our results indicate that murine P49771 and GM- P04141 genes coexpressed by a bicistronic plasmid modulate the class of immune responses and may be superior to those codelivered by two separate monocistronic plasmids as the genetic adjuvants for P04626 /neu DNA vaccine .
