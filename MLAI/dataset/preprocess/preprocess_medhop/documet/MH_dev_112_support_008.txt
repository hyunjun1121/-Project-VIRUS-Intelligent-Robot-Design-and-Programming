Expression profiling of cancer-related genes in human keratinocytes following non-lethal ultraviolet B irradiation . Ultraviolet B irradiation initiates and promotes skin cancers , photo-aging , and immune suppression . In order to elucidate the effect of these processes at the level of gene expression , we used cDNA microarray technology to examine the effect of ultraviolet B irradiation on 588 cancer-related genes in human keratinocytes at 1 , 6 , and 24 h post-irradiation with a mildly cytotoxic dose of ultraviolet B ( 170 mJ/cm(2) ) . The viability of the irradiated keratinocytes was 75 % at 24 h post-irradiation . Various cytokeratins and transcription factors were up-regulated within 1 h post-irradiation . After 6 h , expression of a variety of genes related to growth regulation ( e.g. P38936 ( P38936 ) , notch 4 , and smoothened ) , apoptosis ( e.g. caspase 10 , hTRIP , and Q13114 ) , DNA repair ( P07992 , P18887 ) , cytokines ( e.g. P05231 , P35225 , TGF-beta , and endothelin 2 ) , and cell adhesion ( e.g. RhoE , and RhoGDI ) were altered in human keratinocytes . These data suggest the changes in a cascade of gene expression in human keratinocytes occurring within 24 h after UVB exposure . Although the roles of these cellular genes after UVB-irradiation remain to be elucidated , microarray analysis may provide a new view of gene expression in epidermal keratinocytes following UVB exposure .
