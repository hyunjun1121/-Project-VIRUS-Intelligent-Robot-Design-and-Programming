Analysis of CAD gene amplification using a combined approach of molecular genetics and cytogenetics . CAD is a multifunctional protein which catalyzes the first three steps of de novo uridine biosynthesis . Rodent cells resistant to DB03459 , a specific inhibitor of the ATCase activity of CAD , overproduce the P27708 and CAD mRNA as a direct result of the amplification of the CAD gene . In order to study the mechanism of CAD gene amplification , a functional Syrian hamster CAD gene was inserted into a cosmid vector using molecular cloning techniques . The cloned genes were assayed for biological function by fusing CAD-deficient Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell mutants with protoplasts of E. coli containing the CAD cosmids . Two clones with functional CAD genes were isolated and shown to contain inserts 40 and 45 kb long . The cloned genes could also be introduced into wild type CHO cells by selecting for cells which became resistant to high DB03459 concentrations in a single step . Transformations of mutant and wild type CHO cells contained multiple active copies of the donated Syrian hamster CAD genes in addition to their endogenous CHO CAD genes . The cloned genes in all transformants analyzed are integrated into host cell chromosomes at single locations defined by in situ hybridization . Independently isolated transformants contain the donated genes in different chromosomes . Co-transformation of CHO cells with two different genes by protoplast fusion is also shown to be possible .
