The LUX-Lung clinical trial program of afatinib for non-small-cell lung cancer . P00533 ( P00533 ) -mutant non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) represents a distinct disease entity whose molecular phenotype predicts exquisite sensitivity to the reversible P00533 -tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) gefitinib or erlotinib . However , primary or acquired resistance to these agents remains a major clinical problem . DB08916 is a novel dual irreversible P00533 / P04626 TKI that has been shown in preclinical studies to potentially prevent , delay or overcome resistance to reversible P00533 -TKIs . On this basis , the LUX-Lung clinical trial program has been recently launched for testing this molecule in advanced NSCLC patients . Notably , early results from the randomized LUX-Lung 1 trial indicate that afatinib significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared with placebo in pretreated patients with clinically acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib . On the other hand , the LUX-Lung 2 trial shows that afatinib is highly active in the P00533 -mutant subgroup of patients . While these preliminary data open a new exciting scenario for the future development of anti- P00533 therapies in NSCLC , ongoing afatinib trials will definitively establish a role for this molecule in the treatment of advanced NSCLC .
