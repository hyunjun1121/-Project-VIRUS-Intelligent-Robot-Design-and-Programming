P05231 -receptor polymorphisms rs12083537 , rs2228145 , and rs4329505 as predictors of response to tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis . DB06273 ( TCZ ) , a monoclonal antibody targeting the human interleukin-6-receptor ( IL-6R ) , is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . We examined whether three P08887 single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs12083537 , rs2228145 ( formerly rs8192284 ) , and rs4329505 with previously reported functional effects were associated with clinical response to TCZ in a retrospective study cohort consisting of 79 RA patients . Three months after initiation of TCZ therapy , changes in swollen joint count ( SJC ) and , subordinately , tender joint count ( TJC ) , serum-CRP , DAS28-CRP , and EULAR-response were tested for association with the P08887 -haplotype or genotype . The major allele ( A ) of rs12083537 and the minor allele ( C ) of rs4329505 were associated with a poor SJC response ( P=0.02 and 0.02 , respectively ) . Moreover , the AAC-haplotype ( for rs12083537 , rs2228145 , and rs4329505 , respectively ) was associated with a poor SJC response ( P=0.00004 ) and , with borderline significance , EULAR-response ( P=0.05 ) . These data suggest that genetic variation in P08887 may aid in predicting TCZ therapy outcome in RA patients .
