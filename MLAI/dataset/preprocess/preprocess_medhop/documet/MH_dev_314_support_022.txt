Salacia oblonga extract increases glucose transporter 4-mediated glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 rat myotubes : role of mangiferin . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : To evaluate if the antidiabetic properties of Salacia oblonga extract are mediated not only by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glycosidases but also by enhancing glucose transport in muscle and adipose cells . METHODS : S. oblonga extract effects on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake were assayed in muscle Q9BTT4 -myotubes and 3T3-adipocytes . In Q9BTT4 -myotubes , the amount and translocation of glucose transporters were assayed . A fractionation of the extract was carried out to identify the active compounds . Furthermore , we analyzed the phosphorylation status of key components of signaling pathways that are involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating glucose uptake . RESULTS : S. oblonga extract increased 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake by 50 % in Q9BTT4 -myotubes and 3T3-adipocytes . In Q9BTT4 -myotubes , the extract increased up to a 100 % the P14672 content , activating P14672 promoter transcription and its translocation to the plasma membrane . Mangiferin was identified as the bioactive compound . Furthermore , mangiferin effects were concomitant with the phosphorylation of DB00131 -activated protein kinase without the activation of P31749 /Akt . The effect of mangiferin on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was blocked by GW9662 , an irreversible P37231 antagonist . CONCLUSIONS : S. oblonga extract and mangiferin may exert their antidiabetic effect by increasing P14672 expression and translocation in muscle cells . These effects are probably mediated through two independent pathways that are related to DB00131 -activated protein kinase and P37231 .
