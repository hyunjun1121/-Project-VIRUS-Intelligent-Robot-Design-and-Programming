DB06681 and sirolimus prolong nonhuman primate islet allograft survival : adverse consequences of concomitant alefacept therapy . Calcineurin inhibitors ( CNI ) and steroids are known to promote insulin resistance , and their avoidance after islet transplantation is preferred from a metabolic standpoint . DB06681 , a P33681 -specific mediator of costimulation blockade ( CoB ) , is clinically indicated as a CNI alternative in renal transplantation , and we have endeavored to develop a clinically translatable , belatacept-based regimen that could obviate the need for both CNIs and steroids . Based on the known synergy between CoB and P42345 inhibition , we studied rhesus monkeys undergoing MHC-mismatched islet allotransplants treated with belatacept and the P42345 inhibitor , sirolimus . To extend prior work on CoB-resistant rejection , some animals also received P06729 blockade with alefacept ( P19256 -Ig ) . Nine rhesus macaques were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and underwent islet allotransplantation . All received belatacept and sirolimus ; six also received alefacept . DB06681 and sirolimus significantly prolonged rejection-free graft survival ( median 225 days compared to 8 days in controls receiving basiliximab and sirolimus ; p = 0.022 ) . The addition of alefacept provided no additional survival benefit , but was associated with Cytomegalovirus reactivation in four of six animals . No recipients produced donor-specific alloantibodies . The combination of belatacept and sirolimus successfully prevents islet allograft survival in rhesus monkeys , but induction with alefacept provides no survival benefit and increases the risk of viral reactivation .
