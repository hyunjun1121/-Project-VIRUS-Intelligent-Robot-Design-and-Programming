Induction of DNA methylation and gene silencing by short interfering RNAs in human cells . Double-stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) induce post-transcriptional gene silencing in several species of animal and plant . In plants , dsRNAs targeted to CpG islands within a promoter can also induce RNA-directed DNA methylation ; however , it remains unclear whether gene silencing mediated by DNA methylation can be induced by dsRNAs in mammalian cells . Here , we demonstrate that short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ; 21-25-nucleotide RNA molecules ) induce DNA methylation and histone H3 methylation in human cells . Synthetic siRNAs targeted to CpG islands of an P12830 promoter induced significant DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation in both MCF-7 and normal mammary epithelial cells . As a result , these siRNAs repressed expression of the P12830 gene at the transcriptional level . In addition , disrupting the expression of either one of two DNA methyltransferases ( P26358 or Q9UBC3 ) by specific siRNAs abolished the siRNA-mediated methylation of DNA . Moreover , vector-based siRNAs targeted to the erbB2 ( also known as P04626 ) promoter also induced DNA methylation in MCF-7 cells . Thus , siRNAs targeted to CpG islands within the promoter of a specific gene can induce transcriptional gene silencing by means of DNA-methyltransferase-dependent methylation of DNA in human cells , and might have potential as a new type of gene therapeutic agent .
