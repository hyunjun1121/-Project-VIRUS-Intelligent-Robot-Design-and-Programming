Tanshinone IIA inhibits endothelin-1 production in P01375 -induced brain microvascular endothelial cells through suppression of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 synthesis . AIM : To investigate the effects of tanshinone IIA ( Tan IIA ) on the regulation of the production of endothelin ( ET ) -1 ( including large ET-1 ) , mRNA levels of ET-1 , endothelin-converting enzyme-1 ( P42892 ) , endothelin-A receptor ( P25101 ) and endothelin-B receptor ( ETB ) induced by P01375 in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMVEC ) . METHODS : The ET-1 release ( including large ET-1 ) into the culture medium was determined by enzyme immunoassay . The levels of ET-1 , P42892 , P25101 , and ETB mRNA were measured by RT-PCR . Endothelin receptor binding was also tested . RESULTS : The induction of ET-1 release by P01375 from cultured BMVEC was dose-dependently reduced by Tan IIA , but large ET-1 levels progressively increased in response to Tan IIA ; the mRNA expression of ET-1 was unaffected . Tan IIA also caused a decrease in P25101 receptor mRNA and P42892 expression in a dose-dependent manner . Endothelin receptor binding was unaltered in BMVEC stimulated with P01375 alone or a combination of P01375 and Tan IIA . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that Tan IIA may inhibit ET-1 production in P01375 -induced BMVEC through the suppression of P42892 synthesis .
