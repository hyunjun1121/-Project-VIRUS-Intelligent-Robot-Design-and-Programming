Inhibition of proliferation , migration , and matrix metalloprotease production in malignant mesothelioma cells by tyrosine kinase inhibitors . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is expressed in a variety of human solid tumors , including malignant mesothelioma . P00533 has been implicated in regulation of cell proliferation , survival , angiogenesis , and metastasis , making it an ideal target for drug development . ZD1839 ( gefitinib ) and DB00530 ( erlotinib ) are new , low-molecular-weight , P00533 -selective tyrosine kinase ( TK ) inhibitors , whereas DB05424 is a pan- P00533 family TK inhibitor . In the present study , we used ZD1839 , DB00530 , and DB05424 and investigated the effect of these drugs on proliferation , migration , and matrix metalloprotease ( MMP ) production in three malignant mesothelioma cell lines ( M14K , ZL34 , and SPC212 ) . Using [3H]thymidine incorporation , DNA synthesis assay , we found that all three drugs inhibited transforming growth factor-alpha ( TGF-alpha ) -induced cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . In addition , all three drugs induced apoptosis in ZL34 cells as determined by flow cytometry using annexin-V staining . Furthermore , all three drugs inhibited TGF-alpha-induced cell migration ( chemotaxis ) in a dose-dependent manner as determined by Boyden chamber assay . TGF-alpha-induced P14780 production was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner as determined by gelatin zymography in three cell lines tested . In conclusion , our study demonstrates inhibitory effectiveness of P00533 -TK inhibitors in malignant mesothelioma cells and suggests that these drugs may be an effective treatment strategy for malignant mesothelioma .
