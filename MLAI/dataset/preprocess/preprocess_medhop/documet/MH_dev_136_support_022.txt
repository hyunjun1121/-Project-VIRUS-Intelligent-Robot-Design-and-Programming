Molecular targets in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GIST ) therapy . Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GISTs ) are the most common mesenchimal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract . Such tumors usually have activating mutations in either P10721 ( 75-80 % ) or Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor alpha ( PDGFRa ) ( 5-10 % ) which lead to ligand-independent signal transduction . Targeting these activated proteins with Imatinib mesylate , a small-molecule kinase inhibitor , has proven useful in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic GISTs . However , more than half of patients develop resistance to Imatinib after about 2 years . Therefore , other targets have been studying in order to implement the therapeutical armamentarium for this disease . DB01268 malate is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets several receptor tyrosine kinases and has proved to prolong survival in Imatinib-resistant patients . Other molecules , such as DB04868 , DB00398 and Dasatinib were shown to be useful in Imatinib resistant mutant cell lines and the results of their activity in humans are being awaited . Recent evidence suggests that GIST cells acquire the capability to escape from the control of P10721 and PDGFRa through the activation of alternative pathways . Therefore , further effort should be invested in the discovery of new signaling pathways , such as P30530 , MET , IGF-R , which might be involved in the evolution of the disease . After a description of P10721 and PDGFRa as known targets of anti-GIST treatments , we review other mechanisms and mediators that might be potential targets of new therapies , providing a comprehensive revision of the new molecular strategies under investigation .
