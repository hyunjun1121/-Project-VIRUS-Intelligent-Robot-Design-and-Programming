Two cyclophilin A homologs with shared and distinct functions important for growth and virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans . P62937 is the target of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) and is encoded by a single unique gene conserved from yeast to humans . In the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans , two homologous linked genes , P15085 and P48052 , were found to encode two conserved cyclophilin A proteins . In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae , in which cyclophilin A mutations confer DB00091 resistance but few other phenotypes , cyclophilin A mutations conferred dramatic phenotypes in C. neoformans . The Cpa1 and Cpa2 cyclophilin A proteins play a shared role in cell growth , mating , virulence and DB00091 toxicity . The Cpa1 and Cpa2 proteins also have divergent functions . cpa1 mutants are inviable at 39 degrees C and attenuated for virulence , whereas cpa2 mutants are viable at 39 degrees C and fully virulent . cpa1 cpa2 double mutants exhibited synthetic defects in growth and virulence . P62937 active site mutants restored growth of cpa1 cpa2 mutants at ambient but not at higher temperatures , suggesting that the prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilin A has an in vivo function .
