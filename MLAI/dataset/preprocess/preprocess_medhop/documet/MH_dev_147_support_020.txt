Enhancement of cytotoxicity of natural product drugs against multidrug resistant variant cell lines of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma by tesmilifene . N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxyl]ethanamine ( tesmilifene ) , a tamoxifen derivative with antihistamine activity , greatly enhanced the survival of doxorubicin-treated , advanced stage breast cancer patients in a phase III trial . However , the molecular basis of tesmilifene action is not firmly established . The effects of tesmilifene on activity of several anticancer drugs was investigated using human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) and breast carcinoma cell lines as a model system . Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) variants of an HNSCC cell line , HN-5a/V15e , and a breast carcinoma cell line , MCF-7/V25a , both highly overexpressed mdr1 ( P08183 ) mRNA and the proteins P-glycoprotein and glutathione transferase-pi . Drug sensitivities were measured by a vital stain after 4 days of continuous exposure to anticancer drug in the absence and presence of tesmilifene at a concentration that alone had no antiproliferative effect . DB04905 had minimal effect on drug cytotoxicity against the parental cell lines . However , the same tesmilifene treatment enhanced cytotoxicity of docetaxel , paclitaxel , epirubicin , doxorubicin , and vinorelbine against both MDR cell lines by up to 50 % . Flow cytometric measurement of annexin V/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that tesmilifene increased the killing of HN-5a/V15e cells caused by docetaxel after 24 and 48h exposure . DB04905 increased accumulation of radiolabelled vincristine in HN-5a/V15e cells , over 4h , by up to 100 % . The results suggest that tesmilifene might be effective in the treatment of tumors that are resistant to natural product drugs . The mechanism of enhancement appears to be related to expression of an ABC pump-dependent , MDR phenotype .
