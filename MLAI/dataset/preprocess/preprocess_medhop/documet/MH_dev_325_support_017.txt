Prime-boost immunization of rabbits with HIV-1 gp120 elicits potent neutralization activity against a primary viral isolate . Development of a vaccine for HIV-1 requires a detailed understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses that can be experimentally elicited to difficult-to-neutralize primary isolates . Rabbits were immunized with the gp120 subunit of HIV-1 JR- P04141 envelope ( Env ) using a DNA-prime protein-boost regimen . We analyzed five sera that showed potent autologous neutralizing activity ( IC50s at âˆ¼10(3) to 10(4) serum dilution ) against pseudoviruses containing Env from the primary isolate JR- P04141 but not from the related isolate JR-FL . Pseudoviruses were created by exchanging each variable and constant domain of JR- P04141 gp120 with that of JR-FL or with mutations in putative N-glycosylation sites . The sera contained different neutralizing activities dependent on P01024 and V5 , P01024 and V4 , or V4 regions located on the glycan-rich outer domain of gp120 . All sera showed enhanced neutralizing activity toward an Env variant that lacked a glycosylation site in V4 . The JR- P04141 gp120 epitopes recognized by the sera are generally distinct from those of several well characterized mAbs ( targeting conserved sites on Env ) or other type-specific responses ( targeting V1 , V2 , or V3 variable regions ) . The activity of one serum requires specific glycans that are also important for 2G12 neutralization and this serum blocked the binding of 2G12 to gp120 . Our findings show that different fine specificities can achieve potent neutralization of HIV-1 , yet this strong activity does not result in improved breadth .
