Cluster analysis of risk factor genetic polymorphisms in Alzheimer 's disease . Multiple genetic variants may contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease . We have analyzed polymorphisms in 9 genes to determine whether particular combinations would contribute to this risk . The genes were P02649 , LDLr , P01034 , P07339 , P01375 , P56817 , P10636 , Q8IWL8 , P29474 , and Q12800 . Three risk groups for the disease were identified . Risk group I was younger , was heterozygous for the P01034 ( GA ) , CTSD2936 ( AG ) , P01375 -308 ( AG ) genetic variants . Risk group II was older , was homozygous for the -427 P02649 promoter polymorphism ( TT ) , and heterozygous for the P10636 deletion and for the Q8IWL8 variant ( QR ) . Group III had both the youngest and oldest subjects , were heterozygous for the -863 ( AC ) and -1031 ( CT ) P01375 promoter polymorphisms . All three groups carried the P02649 4 allele and were heterozygous for both P56817 polymorphisms . The control groups were carriers of the P02649 3 allele and were homozygous for the P56817 genetic variants .
