Autoimmune thyroid disease -- a continuous spectrum . AIM : to present a case report revealing a variant of natural history of autoimmune thyroid disease . CASE REPORT : I.F. , a 39 years old woman , had a previous medical history of Graves ' disease treated with antithyroid drugs ( ATD ) . After 1 year of treatment , the remission was confirmed one and two years after ATD withdrawal . Twenty years after the initial hyperthyroidism , spontaneous subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed . The patient presented both anti DB00024 -receptor ( P16473 ) antibodies ( Ab ) , antithyroperoxidase ( P07202 ) and antithyroglobulin ( antiTgl ) antibodies in elevated titres . CONCLUSION : Because of the shift from hyperthyroidism to euthyroidism or to spontaneous hypothyroidism , Graves ' disease patients demand a strict follow-up after ATD therapy . It seems that there is an effect of TPOAb on thyroid destruction .
