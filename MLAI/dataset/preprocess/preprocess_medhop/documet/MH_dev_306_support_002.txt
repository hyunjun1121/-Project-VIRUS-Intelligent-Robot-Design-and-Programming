DB04956 . Tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) is well established as a key mediator in the inflammatory response seen in various disease processes including sepsis . P01375 is involved in virtually all features of septic shock and multiple organ failure . Anti- P01375 strategies are thus appealing and have been effective at reducing inflammation and morbidity in certain conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn 's disease . DB04956 is the F(ab')2 fragment of a murine anti- P01375 antibody , and has been evaluated in clinical trials in septic patients . The results suggest that the drug is well tolerated , and may be of benefit in certain groups of patients with sepsis . A large , randomised , clinical trial of afelimomab in patients with severe sepsis has recently been completed and the results are eagerly awaited . More work is necessary to identify a means of selecting which patients are most likely to benefit from this type of therapy in sepsis .
