P35354 inhibitors and cancer therapeutics : potential roles for inhibitors of P35354 in combination with cytotoxic therapy : reports from a symposium held in conjunction with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group June 2001 Meeting . Tumor growth and angiogenesis are interdependent . Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins ( PGs ) from arachidonic acid . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) inhibit P36551 -mediated synthesis of PGs . Although P23219 is constitutively expressed in a wide range of tissues , P35354 is cytokine inducible . Enhanced P35354 expression has been attributed a key role in the development of inflammation and related processes observed in pathologically altered disease states . Two specific P35354 inhibitors , namely , rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) and celecoxib ( DB00482 ) , both oral agents and FDA approved , have been shown preclinically and clinically to have efficacy comparable to that of NSAIDs for relief of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis , with decreased risk of gastrointestinal damage . Significant preclinical evidence strongly supports the potential role for these inhibitors for the treatment of cancer . On June 29 , 2001 , the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( www.rtog.org ) , a National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group , held a 1-day symposium focusing on the potential role of inhibitors of P35354 in the treatment of cancer . This issue of the American Journal of Clinical Oncology contains the summary of those presentations .
