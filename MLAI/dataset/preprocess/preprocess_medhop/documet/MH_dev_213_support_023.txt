Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents . Part 1 . A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated . The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR , (13)C NMR and P19957 -HRMS spectra data . All tested compounds proved to be potent P08908 receptor and serotonin transporter protein ( P31645 ) ligands . Among them , compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for P08908 and P31645 . Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15 , 31 and 32 to models of P08908 receptor and P31645 confirm the results of biological tests . Due to high affinity for the P08908 receptor and moderate affinity for P31645 , compounds 31 , 32 , 35 , and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L , P50406 , P34969 and 5- Q13049 receptors . In vivo tests , in turn , resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15 , 18 , 19 and 30 to the P08908 receptor . The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of P08908 receptor agonists .
