P29323 signalling pathway is not involved in PSA- P13591 -dependent alterations of hippocampal plasticity evoked by P21554 receptor activation . The present study investigated the potential role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) pathway in the alternation of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule ( PSA- P13591 ) expression and proliferation rates in the dentate gyrus ( DG ) evoked by activation of the P21554 receptor . When given at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg , the P21554 receptor agonist , 3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-11-hydroxy-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( HU-210 ) , increased the levels of the phosphorylated forms of P29323 ( pERK1 and pERK2 ) in the hippocampus when measured 30 min after injection . This HU-210-induced effect was inhibited by alpha-{amino[(4-aminophenyl)thio]methylene}-2-(trifluoromethyl) benzeneacetonitrile ( SL327 , 30 mg/kg ) - an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( Q02750 /2 ) , the upstream kinase of P29323 - given 1 h before HU-210 administration . Additionally , SL327 alone significantly attenuated the basal level of both pERK1 and pERK2 . HU-210 ( 0.1 mg/kg ) decreased the number of PSA- P13591 -immunoreactive ( IR ) cells but did not affect the rate of proliferation , which was analyzed as the number of Ki-67-IR cells measured in the DG 2 days after HU-210 administration . The data indicated that SL327 ( 30 mg/kg ) alone decreased the number of PSA- P13591 -IR cells 2 days after treatment . Joint administration of SL327 and HU-210 decreased the number of PSA- P13591 cells more robustly than did the administration of either alone . In addition , SL327 did not decrease the number of Ki-67-IR cells , while pretreatment with SL327 1 h before HU-210 administration did . These results suggest that stimulation of the P29323 cascade caused by P21554 receptor activation is not involved in hippocampal plasticity governed by PSA- P13591 expression .
