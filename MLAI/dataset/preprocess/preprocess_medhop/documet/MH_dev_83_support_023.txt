Interactive effect of interleukin-6 and prostaglandin E2 on osteoclastogenesis via the O00300 / O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 system . The O00300 / O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 system regulates osteoclastogenesis . Both cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) /prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) and interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) are reported to induce osteoclast differentiation . The mechanisms underlying these signaling pathways on the O00300 / O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 system are not fully understood . We herein demonstrate that P35354 and DB00917 stimulated osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of O00300 secretion , stimulation of O14788 production by osteoblasts , and upregulation of Q9Y6Q6 expression in osteoclasts . DB00917 also stimulated P05231 production , and P05231 , in turn , increased DB00917 secretion , P35354 , and EP4/EP2 expression in bone cells . These findings provide evidence of interactive effect of DB00917 and P05231 signaling pathways in osteoclastogenesis via effect on the O00300 / O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 system .
