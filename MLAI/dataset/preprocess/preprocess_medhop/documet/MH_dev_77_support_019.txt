Structural analysis of botulinum neurotoxin serotype F light chain : implications on substrate binding and inhibitor design . The seven serologically distinct Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs A-G ) are zinc endopeptidases which block the neurotransmitter release by cleaving one of the three proteins of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor complex ( SNARE complex ) essential for the fusion of vesicles containing neurotransmitters with target membranes . These metallopeptidases exhibit unique specificity for the substrates and peptide bonds they cleave . Development of countermeasures and therapeutics for BoNTs is a priority because of their extreme toxicity and potential misuse as biowarfare agents . Though they share sequence homology and structural similarity , the structural information on each one of them is required to understand the mechanism of action of all of them because of their specificity . Unraveling the mechanism will help in the ultimate goal of developing inhibitors as antibotulinum drugs for the toxins . Here , we report the high-resolution structure of active BoNT/F catalytic domain in two crystal forms . The structure was exploited for modeling the substrate binding and identifying the S1 ' subsite and the putative exosites which are different from DB00083 or BoNT/B . The orientation of docking of the substrate at the active site is consistent with the experimental DB00083 -LC: P60880 peptide model and our proposed model for BoNT/E-LC: P60880 .
