P16410 ( P16410 ) modulates the Th subset response and alters the course of experimental Leishmania major infection . Since both the nature and the amplitude of an antigen-specific T cell response are dependent on co-stimulatory signals , we have investigated the role of P10747 / P16410 -mediated T cell co-stimulation in the regulation of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis . P10747 -deficient mice and their wild-type littermates are equally susceptible to Leishmania major infection . Whole anti- P16410 antibody significantly exacerbates the disease while anti- P16410 Fab ameliorates the disease in genetically susceptible BALB/c mice but not in C57BL/6 , a resistant strain . The anti- P16410 -induced exacerbation of the disease is accompanied by increased P05112 -secreting cell number , diminished parasite-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response and augmented anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl ( TNP ) IgG1 in response to TNP-leishmanial antigen crude soluble antigen ( Q13216 ) , suggesting an exaggerated Th2 type of response . Anti- P16410 Fab-mediated amelioration of the disease is associated with increased P01579 -secreting cell number , increased parasite-specific DTH response and enhanced IgG2a isotype in response to TNP- Q13216 suggesting a Th1 type of response . Unlike TNP- Q13216 , TNP- DB05299 does not induce the change in Ig isotype , indicating that the immunomodulatory effect of anti- P16410 is antigen specific . Anti- P16410 antibody-induced early change in Th subsets suggests an important role for P16410 in determining the course of L. major infection , perhaps by alteration of Th subset differentiation .
