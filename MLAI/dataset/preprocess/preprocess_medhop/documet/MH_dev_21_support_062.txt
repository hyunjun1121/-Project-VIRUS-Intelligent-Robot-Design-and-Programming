Association between urokinase-plasminogen activator gene T4065C polymorphism and risk of mitral valve prolapse . BACKGROUND : Abnormalities of collagen and elastic fibers were found in floppy mitral valves ( FMV ) . DB00013 -plasminogen activator ( P00749 ) was suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of elastin and collagen degradation in arterial aneurysm . The role of P00749 genetic variant in mitral valve prolapse ( Q14764 ) has not been studied . We , therefore , performed a case-controlled study investigating the possible relation between the P00749 gene polymorphisms and risk of Q14764 in Taiwan Chinese . METHODS : We studied 100 patients with Q14764 diagnosed by echocardiography and 106 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects . The T4065C and T3995C polymorphisms of the P00749 gene were identified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based restriction analysis . RESULTS : There was a significant difference in either the genotype distribution or allelic frequencies between Q14764 cases and controls for P00749 gene T4065C polymorphism ( P = 0.0001 and 0.0002 , respectively ) . An odds ratio for risk of Q14764 associated with P00749 T4065C TC genotype was 6.03 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.11-14.83 ) . An odds ratio for risk of Q14764 associated with P00749 T4065C T allele was 4.99 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.93-12.91 ) . There was no significant difference in either the genotype distribution or allelic frequencies between Q14764 cases and controls for P00749 T3995C polymorphism . Further categorization of the Q14764 patients into mild and severe subgroups revealed no statistical difference between these two subgroups for P00749 T4065C and T3995C polymorphisms . CONCLUSIONS : This study shows that patients with Q14764 have a higher frequency of P00749 T4065C TC genotype and T allele that supports a role of the P00749 T4065C polymorphism in determining the risk of Q14764 among the Chinese population in Taiwan .
