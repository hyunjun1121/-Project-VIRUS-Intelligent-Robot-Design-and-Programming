DB00945 -mediated P35354 transcript stabilization via sustained p38 activation in human intestinal myofibroblasts . Acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) is a cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor , yet some of its therapeutic effects are thought to derive from mechanisms unrelated to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition . In human intestinal myofibroblasts , aspirin , at therapeutic doses , had the unexpected effect of inducing prolonged P35354 expression . This induction was especially pronounced when cells were treated with interleukin-1alpha ( IL-1 ) plus aspirin for 24 h . Sodium salicylate , a poor P36551 inhibitor , likewise enhanced IL-1-mediated P35354 gene expression whereas DB00244 ( DB00244 ) or indomethacin had no effect . The P35354 transcriptional rate , measured by nuclear runoff analysis and heterogeneous nuclear RNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , was only modestly elevated by aspirin treatment . In contrast , aspirin treatment dramatically stabilized the P35354 message . The P35354 mRNA half-life in IL-1 treated cells was 1 h and was increased in excess of 5 h in IL-1 + aspirin-treated cells . Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was enhanced in aspirin-treated cells ( but not in cells treated with DB00244 or indomethacin ) for up to 24 h after treatment . Inhibition of p38 activity negated aspirin-mediated P35354 mRNA stabilization and the resultant increase in P35354 mRNA and protein levels . The modest transcriptional response seen in aspirin treated cells was also abolished by p38 inhibition . We conclude that aspirin enhances P35354 expression via sustained activation of p38 , which results in prolonged stabilization of the P35354 message and a slightly elevated transcription rate . DB00945 also enhanced steady-state mRNA levels of other IL-1 modulated genes ( IL-1beta , P05231 , groalpha , and TNFalpha ) that are likewise regulated at the level of message stability via p38 activation .
