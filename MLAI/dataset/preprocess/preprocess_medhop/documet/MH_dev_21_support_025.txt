DB00013 mediates fibrinolysis in the pulmonary microvasculature . The role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) in fibrinolysis remains unsettled . The contribution of uPA may depend on the vascular location , the physical properties of the clot , and its impact on tissue function . To study the contribution of urokinase within the pulmonary microvasculature , a model of pulmonary microembolism in the mouse was developed . Iodine 125 ( (125)I ) -labeled fibrin microparticles injected intravenously through the tail vein lodged preferentially in the lung , distributing homogeneously throughout the lobes . Clearance of (125)I-microemboli in wild type mice was rapid and essentially complete by 5 hours . In contrast , uPA(-/-) and tissue-type plasminogen activator tPA(-/-) mice , but not Q03405 (-/-) mice , showed a marked impairment in pulmonary fibrinolysis throughout the experimental period . The phenotype in the uPA(-/-) mouse was rescued completely by infusion of single chain uPA ( scuPA ) . The increment in clot lysis was 4-fold greater in uPA(-/-) mice infused with the same concentration of scuPA complexed with soluble recombinant Q03405 . These data indicate that uPA contributes to endogenous fibrinolysis in the pulmonary vasculature to the same extent as tPA in this model system . Binding of scuPA to its receptor promotes fibrinolytic activity in vivo as well as in vitro . The physical properties of fibrin clots , including size , age , and cellular composition , as well as heterogeneity in endothelial cell function , may modify the participation of uPA in endogenous fibrinolysis .
