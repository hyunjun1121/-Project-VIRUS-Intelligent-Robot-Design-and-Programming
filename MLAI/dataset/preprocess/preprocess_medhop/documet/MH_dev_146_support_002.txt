Elevated maternal cortisol early in pregnancy predicts third trimester levels of placental corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) : priming the placental clock . The purposes of this study were to determine the intervals when placental corticotrophic-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) was most responsive to maternal cortisol . A sample of 203 women each were evaluated at 15 , 19 , 25 and 31 weeks gestation and followed to term . Placental P06850 and maternal adrenocorticotropin hormone ( DB01285 ) , B-endorphin and cortisol were determined from plasma . P06850 levels increased faster and were higher in women who delivered preterm compared with women who delivered at term ( P13726 ,603 = 5.73 , p < .001 ) . Simple effects indicated that P06850 levels only at 31 weeks predicted preterm birth ( F1,201 = 5.53 , p = .02 ) . Levels of cortisol were higher in women who delivered preterm at 15 weeks gestation ( F1,201 = 4.45 , p = .03 ) with a similar trend at 19 weeks gestation . Hierarchical regression suggested that the influence on birth outcome of maternal cortisol early in pregnancy was mediated by its influence on placental P06850 at 31 weeks . Elevated cortisol at 15 weeks predicted the surge in placental P06850 at 31 weeks ( R = .49 , d.f. = 1,199 , Fchange = 61.78 , p < .0001 ) . Every unit of change in cortisol ( microg/dl ) at 15 weeks was associated with a 34 unit change of P06850 ( pg/ml ) at 31 weeks . These findings suggested that early detection of stress signals by the placenta stimulated the subsequent release of P06850 and resulted in increased risk for preterm delivery .
