Cloning and initial characterization of a new subunit for mammalian serine-palmitoyltransferase . DB00133 -palmitoyltransferase ( P21549 ) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids . P21549 is considered to be a heterodimer composed of two subunits , O15269 and O15270 . Here we report the identification of a novel , third , P21549 subunit ( Q9NUV7 ) that shows 68 % homology to the O15270 subunit . Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Q9NUV7 expression is highly variable between different human tissues and cell lines . The highest expression was observed in placenta tissue and human trophoblast cell lines . The overexpression of Q9NUV7 in Hek293 cells , which otherwise have very little endogenous Q9NUV7 , led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cellular P21549 activity . Silencing of Q9NUV7 expression in HepG2 cells or human trophoblast cells by transfecting Q9NUV7 -specific siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of cellular P21549 activity . The expression of two P21549 isoforms could be a cellular mechanism to adjust P21549 activity to tissue-specific requirements of sphingolipid synthesis .
