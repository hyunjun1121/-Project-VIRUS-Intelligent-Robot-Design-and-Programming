Novel phenolic antioxidants as multifunctional inhibitors of inducible P19320 expression for use in atherosclerosis . A series of novel phenolic compounds has been discovered as potent inhibitors of P01375 -inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) with concurrent antioxidant and lipid-modulating properties . Optimization of these multifunctional agents led to the identification of 3a ( DB05399 ) as a clinical candidate with demonstrated efficacies in animal models of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia .
