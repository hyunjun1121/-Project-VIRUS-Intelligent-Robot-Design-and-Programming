A new approach in the study of the molecular and cellular events implicated in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . Formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates . DB01109 -induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , a relatively common complication of heparin therapy , results of platelet activation , via the receptor for the Fc domain of IgG ( FcgammaRIIa ) , by heparin-dependent-antibodies , commonly directed against the heparin-platelet factor 4 ( H- P02776 ) antigenic complex . Our strategy was to use whole blood allowing the study of leukocyte-platelet interactions . Experiments were performed with blood from healthy donors incubated with HIT patients ' plasma and different concentrations of heparin . We showed that 75 % of the HIT patients ' plasma induced the formation of leukocyte-platelet-aggregates in a heparin-dependent-manner . The formation of leukocyte-platelet-aggregates induced by HIT plasma in the presence of heparin was ( i ) independent of the healthy blood donor FcgammaRIIa polymorphism , ( ii ) correlated with the levels of anti H- P02776 IgG antibodies contained in the patients ' plasma , and to a lesser extent to anti H- P02776 IgM antibodies , and ( iii ) was mediated by P16109 . This report opens new prospects in the study of the molecular and cellular events implicated in HIT .
