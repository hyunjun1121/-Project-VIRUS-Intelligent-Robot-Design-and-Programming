DB00398 treatment of P36888 -ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia : favorable initial outcome and mechanisms of subsequent nonresponsiveness associated with the emergence of a D835 mutation . Internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 ( P36888 ) gene occurs in 30 % of acute myeloid leukemias ( AMLs ) and confers a poor prognosis . Thirteen relapsed or chemo-refractory P36888 -ITD(+) AML patients were treated with sorafenib ( 200-400 mg twice daily ) . Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 ( range 21-84 ) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells . The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 ( range 54-287 ) days but the P36888 and downstream effectors remained suppressed . Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including P00352 , P52333 , and P51511 , whose functions were unknown in AML . Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results . Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells ( LICs ) from samples before sorafenib treatment . LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance . These results suggest that sorafenib have selected more aggressive sorafenib-resistant subclones carrying both P36888 -ITD and D835 mutations , and might provide important leads to further improvement of treatment outcome with P36888 inhibitors .
