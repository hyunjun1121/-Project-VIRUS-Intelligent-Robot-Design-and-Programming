Botulinum neurotoxin type A subtype 2 confers greater safety than subtype 1 in a rat Parkinson 's disease model . Botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) cleaves P60880 and interrupts the release of acetylcholine . We previously reported that DB00083 subtype 2 ( BoNT/A2 ) ameliorates pathologic behavior more effectively than subtype 1 ( BoNT/A1 ) in a rat Parkinson 's disease model . Here , we further show BoNT/A2 has fewer adverse effects than BoNT/A1 . We first confirmed that intrastriatal treatments of both BoNT/As had no-effect on dopaminergic terminals in the striatum . P60880 cleaved by BoNT/A2 was strictly localized to the striatum on the injected side ; however , P60880 cleaved by BoNT/A1 diffused contralaterally . Furthermore , treatment with BoNT/A1 caused a significant reduction in body weight , while BoNT/A2 treatment did not . These results suggest that BoNT/A2 is more beneficial for clinical application against Parkinson 's disease than BoNT/A1 .
