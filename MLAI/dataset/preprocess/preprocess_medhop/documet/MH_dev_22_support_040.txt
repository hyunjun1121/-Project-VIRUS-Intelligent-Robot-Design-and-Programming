DB00072 emtansine in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer : a review . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : In this review , we aim to update the clinical data of trastuzumab-DM1 ( DB05773 ) in terms of safety and efficacy , and describe ongoing and future trials evaluating its potential role in the management of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) -positive breast cancer . RECENT FINDINGS : DB00072 emtansine ( DB05773 ) is an antibody drug conjugate that optimizes delivery of chemotherapy with an anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody . As a conjugate , DB05773 's systemic side effects are significantly minimized due to its targeted delivery by trastuzumab to P04626 -positive cells . Phase I and II studies show that the maximum tolerated dose , and thus the recommended dose for DB05773 , is 3.6 mg/kg given intravenously every 3 weeks . Single arm phase Ib/II , II and a randomized phase II first-line study of DB05773 versus the combination of trastuzumab + docetaxel all showed improved tolerability , and at least equivalent efficacy , compared with our current standard of care . Two randomized phase III registration studies are now active , evaluating this agent in the refractory and first-line P04626 -positive settings . SUMMARY : DB05773 has been shown to be a very promising agent for the targeted delivery of chemotherapy and anti- P04626 monoclonal antibody therapy for patients with metastatic , P04626 -positive breast cancer . DB05773 will likely play a role in the management of patients with advanced and early stage P04626 -positive breast cancer , but this awaits further study .
