Role of P20333 polymorphisms in the response of Crohn 's disease patients to infliximab . DB00065 ( IFX ) is a valid treatment for Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , but a relevant percentage of patients do not benefit from this therapy . In the Japanese population , the response to IFX was associated with markers in the P01375 receptor superfamily 1A ( P19438 ) and 1B ( P20333 ) genes . We aimed to replicate the association previously described in the Japanese population and to ascertain the role of P01375 receptors as modulators of the response to IFX . We studied 297 white Spanish CD patients with a known response to IFX : 238 responders and 59 primary nonresponders . Four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were analyzed : rs767455 in P19438 and rs1061622 , rs1061624 , and rs3397 in P20333 . Comparisons between groups were performed with chi-square tests or the Fisher 's exact test . Different features ( sex , age , disease duration , smoking among others ) were evaluated as possible confounding factors . No significant association was found between the studied P19438 polymorphisms and response to IFX . In the P20333 gene , the haplotype rs1061624_A-rs3397_T was significantly increased in nonresponders : p = 0.015 , OR = 1.78 , 95 % CI 1.09-2.90 ; and an increased frequency of rs1061622_G carriers was observed in patients with remission : p = 0.033 vs nonresponders and p = 0.023 vs patients with a partial response . Our results support a role of P20333 gene variants in the response to IFX in CD patients .
