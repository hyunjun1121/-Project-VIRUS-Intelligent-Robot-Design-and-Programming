P00747 activator inhibitor-1 is a critical downstream target of p53 in the induction of replicative senescence . p53 limits the proliferation of primary diploid fibroblasts by inducing a state of growth arrest named replicative senescence - a process which protects against oncogenic transformation and requires integrity of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway . However , little is known about the downstream target genes of p53 in this growth-limiting response . Here , we report that suppression of the p53 target gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) by RNA interference ( RNAi ) leads to escape from replicative senescence both in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and primary human BJ fibroblasts . P05121 knockdown results in sustained activation of the PI(3)K- P31749 -GSK3beta pathway and nuclear retention of cyclin D1 , consistent with a role for P05121 in regulating growth factor signalling . In agreement with this , we find that the PI(3)K- P31749 -GSK3beta-cyclin D1 pathway is also causally involved in cellular senescence . Conversely , ectopic expression of P05121 in proliferating p53-deficient murine or human fibroblasts induces a phenotype displaying all the hallmarks of replicative senescence . Our data indicate that P05121 is not merely a marker of senescence , but is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of replicative senescence downstream of p53 .
