Association of haplotypes of inflammation-related genes with gastric preneoplastic lesions in African Americans and Caucasians . Identification of biomarkers is needed for development of screening programs to prevent gastric cancer . Because racial differences exist in cancer rates , we aimed to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and gastric preneoplastic lesions in African Americans and Caucasians from Louisiana , USA . Gastric biopsies from 569 adults ( 361 African Americans and 208 Caucasians ) undergoing diagnostic endoscopy were used for histological diagnosis and genomic DNA extraction . Polymorphisms within eight genes ( P01584 , P10145 , P05231 , P01375 , P35354 , P05089 , P22301 and P01137 ) were investigated by TaqMan . The cagA status of Helicobacter pylori infection was assessed by PCR . Haplotype logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia . African Americans carrying the haplotype P01584 -511T/-31C/+3954T , which includes the three risk-associated alleles at the P01584 locus , were more likely to being diagnosed with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia than those carrying the most common haplotype T-C-C ( adjusted OR : 2.51 , 95 % CI : 1.1-5.5 ) . None of the polymorphisms were associated with intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia in Caucasians . Age and cagA-positive status were independent factors associated with these lesions . Haplotypes at the P01584 locus may participate in mediating the susceptibility to gastric carcinogenesis and might be useful as markers of advanced premalignant lesions in African Americans . Interestingly , carriage of P01584 +3954T allele seems to be the key factor , even though the role played by other polymorphisms can not be excluded .
