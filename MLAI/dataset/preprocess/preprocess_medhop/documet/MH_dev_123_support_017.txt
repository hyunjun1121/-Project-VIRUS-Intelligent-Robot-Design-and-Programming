Adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 expression in human obesity and insulin resistance . Adipose tissue expresses tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and interleukin ( IL ) -6 , which may cause obesity-related insulin resistance . We measured P01375 and P05231 expression in the adipose tissue of 50 lean and obese subjects without diabetes . P01308 sensitivity ( S(I) ) was determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal-model analysis . When lean [ body mass index ( BMI ) < 25 kg/m(2) ] and obese ( BMI 30-40 kg/m(2) ) subjects were compared , there was a 7.5-fold increase in P01375 secretion ( P < 0.05 ) from adipose tissue , and the P01375 secretion was inversely related to S(I) ( r = -0.42 , P < 0.02 ) . P05231 was abundantly expressed by adipose tissue . In contrast to P01375 , plasma ( rather than adipose ) P05231 demonstrated the strongest relationship with obesity and insulin resistance . Plasma P05231 was significantly higher in obese subjects and demonstrated a highly significant inverse relationship with S(I) ( r = -0.71 , P < 0.001 ) . To separate the effects of BMI from S(I) , subjects who were discordant for S(I) were matched for BMI , age , and gender . By use of this approach , subjects with low S(I) demonstrated a 3.0-fold increased level of P01375 secretion from adipose tissue and a 2.3-fold higher plasma P05231 level ( P < 0.05 ) compared with matched subjects with a high S(I) . Plasma P05231 was significantly associated with plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels ( r = 0.49 , P < 0.002 ) . Thus the local expression of P01375 and plasma P05231 are higher in subjects with obesity-related insulin resistance .
