DB01268 mesylate inhibits proliferation of human colonic stromal fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo . OBJECTIVE : Cancer stromal fibroblasts are important members of the cancer microenvironment . In this study , we determined the effect of sunitinib , a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor , on the primary human colonic fibroblasts . METHODS : Cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation assays were performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of sunitinib in vitro . Western-blot analysis was performed to evaluate variations in the levels of phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor β ( P09619 -β ) , Akt , and P29323 proteins . Co-injection of SW620 cells and colonic fibroblasts in nude mice was employed to test anti-growth efficacy in vivo . RESULTS : DB01268 was found to effectively inhibit the growth of primary colonic fibroblasts . Low-dose sunitinib blocked the DB00102 -induced cell proliferation and P09619 -β signaling . Co-injection of SW620 cells and colonic fibroblasts in nude mice generated greater tumor volumes than single injection of SW620 cells . DB01268 treatment inhibited the SW620 cell+colonic fibroblast tumor growth more effectively than treatment of 5-fluorouracil . CONCLUSIONS : DB01268 mesylate inhibited the proliferation of primary human colonic fibroblasts through target-inhibited P09619 signaling in vitro and in vivo .
