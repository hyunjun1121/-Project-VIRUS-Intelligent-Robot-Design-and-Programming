Kir6.2-dependent high-affinity repaglinide binding to beta-cell K( DB00171 ) channels . 1. The beta-cell K( DB00171 ) channel is composed of two types of subunit - the inward rectifier K(+) channel ( Kir6.2 ) which forms the channel pore , and the sulphonylurea receptor ( Q09428 ) , which serves as a regulatory subunit . The N-terminus of Kir6.2 is involved in transduction of sulphonylurea binding into channel closure , and deletion of the N-terminus ( Kir6.2DeltaN14 ) results in functional uncoupling of the two subunits . In this study , we investigate the interaction of the hypoglycaemic agents repaglinide and glibenclamide with Q09428 and the effect of Kir6.2 on this interaction . We further explore how the binding properties of repaglinide and glibenclamide are affected by functional uncoupling of Q09428 and Kir6.2 in Kir6.2DeltaN14/ Q09428 channels . All binding experiments are performed on membranes in DB00171 -free buffer at 37 degrees C . 2 . DB00912 was found to bind with low affinity ( K(D)=59+/-16 nM ) to Q09428 alone , but with high affinity ( increased approximately 150-fold ) when Q09428 was co-expressed with Kir6.2 ( K(D)=0.42+/-0.03 nM ) . DB01016 , tolbutamide and nateglinide all bound with marginally lower affinity to Q09428 than to Kir6.2/ Q09428 . 3 . DB00912 bound with low affinity ( K(D)=51+/-23 nM ) to Q09428 co-expressed with Kir6.2DeltaN14 . In contrast , the affinity for glibenclamide , tolbutamide and nateglinide was only mildly changed as compared to wild-type channels . 4 . In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments inhibition of Kir6.2DeltaN14/ Q09428 currents by both repaglinide and nateglinde is abolished . 5 . The results suggest that Kir6.2 causes a conformational change in Q09428 required for high-affinity repaglinide binding , or that the high-affinity repaglinide-binding site includes contributions from both Q09428 and Kir6.2 . DB01016 , tolbutamide and nateglinide binding appear to involve only Q09428 .
