Mucosal expression of basic fibroblastic growth factor , syndecan 1 and tumour necrosis factor-α in Crohn 's disease in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFα antibodies . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Both inflammation and fibrosis may be detected in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . The molecular pattern of Basic Fibroblastic Growth Factor ( P09038 ) and P18827 ( SD1 ) expression is altered in stenosing CD , but we do not know what the behaviour of this teamwork factor is in CD in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFα antibodies . Our aim was to compare the expression of P09038 , SD1 and P01375 -α in patients with CD in deep remission under treatment with DB00065 ( IFX ) or DB00051 ( P00813 ) and a control group of patients with active CD . METHODS : We assessed the expression of P09038 , SD1 and P01375 -α in 10 patients with active CD and in 28 patients with CD in sustained deep remission for at least 6 months . All patients underwent surveillance colonoscopy with biopsies , while receiving maintenance therapy with IFX or P00813 . Analysis was conducted by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT-PCR ) in biopsy samples . RESULTS : We found that P09038 , SD1 and P01375 -α were significantly reduced under treatment with anti-TNFα versus controls ( p=0.000 ) . P09038 and SD1 expression were similar between IFX and P00813 patients ( p=0.335 and p=0.289 , respectively ) , while P01375 -α was significantly under-expressed in P00813 patients ( p=0.008 ) . CONCLUSIONS : P09038 , SD1 and P01375 -α are significantly reduced in CD patients in deep remission under treatment with anti-TNFα , likely as an expression of optimal control of inflammation . The significance of the P01375 -α under-expression in patients under treatment with P00813 with respect to those under treatment with IFX should be elucidated in further studies .
