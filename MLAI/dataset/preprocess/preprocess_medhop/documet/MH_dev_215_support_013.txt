A new class of NO-donor pro-drugs triggered by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase with potential for reno-selective vasodilatation . This communication describes the synthesis of a new class of N-hydroxyguanidine ( NHG ) pro-drugs which release nitric oxide ( NO ) , triggered by the action of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( γ-GT ) , and have potential for the treatment of acute renal injury/failure ( Q9Y4X5 / Q8N726 ) .
