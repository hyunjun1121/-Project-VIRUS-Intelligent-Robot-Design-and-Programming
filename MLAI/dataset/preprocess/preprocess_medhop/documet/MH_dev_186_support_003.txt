Dual inhibition of PI3K and P42345 signaling pathways decreases human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor metastatic progression . OBJECTIVES : Patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have limited therapeutic options . DB01590 ( RAD001 ) , an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway , has been shown to increase progression-free survival , but not overall survival , indicating a need to identify additional therapeutic targets . Inhibition of P42345 complex 1 by RAD001 may induce upstream AKT upregulation . We hypothesized that dual inhibition of AKT along with P42345 will overcome the limited activity of RAD001 alone . METHODS : The BON cell line has been used as a model to study pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell biology . Western blots and cell growth assays were performed with P42345 inhibitor RAD001 ( 50 nM ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD0325901 ( 50 nM ) , PI3K ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) inhibitor LY294002 ( 25 Î¼M ) , or vehicle control . Nude mice were treated daily for 6 weeks with RAD001 ( oral gavage ) and with LY29400 ( subcutaneous ) 1 week after intrasplenic injection of BON cells . RESULTS : Cellular proliferation was most attenuated with the combination therapy of LY29400 and RAD001 . Similarly , the volume of liver metastasis was lowest in the group treated with both LY29400 ( 100 mg/kg per week , subcutaneous ) and RAD001 ( 2.5 mg/kg per day ) compared with that in the vehicle group ( P = 0.04 ) . CONCLUSION : The combination therapy of LY29400 and RAD001 decreased the cell growth in vitro and progression of liver metastasis in vivo compared with vehicle or with single-drug therapy .
