An overview of phenserine tartrate , a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . Existing cholinesterase ( ChE ) inhibitor therapies for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , while effective in improving cognitive , behavioral and functional impairments , do not alter disease progression . Novel drug design studies have focused on the classical ChE inhibitor , (-)-physostigmine , producing alterations in chemical composition and three-dimensional structure , which may offer an improved therapeutic index . The phenylcarbamate derivative , DB04892 , is a selective , non-competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) . In vivo , DB04892 produces rapid , potent , and long-lasting P22303 inhibition . As a possible result of its preferential brain selectivity , DB04892 is significantly less toxic than (-)-physostigmine . In studies using the Stone maze paradigm , DB04892 has been shown to improve cognitive performance in both young learning-impaired and elderly rats . In addition to reducing inactivation of acetylcholine in the brain , DB04892 appears to have a second mode of action . Reduced secretion of beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) has been observed in cell lines exposed to DB04892 , occurring through translational regulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein ( beta- P05067 ) mRNA via a non-cholinergic mechanism . These in vitro findings appear to translate in vivo into animal models and humans . In a small study of patients with AD , DB04892 treatment tended to reduce beta- P05067 and Abeta levels in plasma samples . Clinical studies also reveal that DB04892 ( 5-10 mg b.i.d. ) had a favorable safety and pharmacological profile , produced significant improvements in cognitive function and was well tolerated in patients with AD treated for 12 weeks . Further randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase III studies assessing the efficacy , safety/tolerability and potential disease-modifying effects of DB04892 in patients with AD are currently ongoing .
