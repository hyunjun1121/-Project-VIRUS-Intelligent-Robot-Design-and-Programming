Tanshinone IIA inhibits constitutive P40763 activation , suppresses proliferation , and induces apoptosis in rat P13671 glioma cells . P40763 ( P40763 ) is usually constitutively activated in a variety of malignancies . Thus , P40763 may be a promising target for treatment of tumor cells . Recently , Tanshinone IIA ( Tan IIA ) , a major active constituent from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge , was reported to have apoptosis inducing effects on a large variety of cancer cells . In this study , we evaluate the anti-proliferation and apoptosis inducing effects of Tan IIA on P13671 glioma cells . Cell growth and proliferation were measured by MTT assay , cell apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry and DNA-fragmentation analysis . Further more , we investigated inhibitory effects of Tan IIA on P40763 activity and its downstream targets : Bcl-XL , cyclin D1 . Alteration of P40763 activity was examined by measuring their DNA binding activity and tyrosine phosphorylation . Changes in the expression levels of Bcl-XL and cyclin D1 were examined by Western blot analysis . We found that the cellular growth were inhibited and cell apoptosis were observed after the treatment with Tan IIA . The P40763 activity was significantly reduced by Tan IIA parallel with a significant attenuation of expression of Bcl-XL and cyclin D1 . These results suggest that Tan IIA may serve as an effective adjunctive reagent in the treatment of glioma for its targeting of constitutive P40763 signaling .
