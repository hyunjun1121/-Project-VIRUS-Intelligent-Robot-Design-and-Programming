Soluble forms of P16070 and CD54 ( P05362 ) cellular adhesion molecules are released by human prostatic cancer cell lines . We have identified that human prostatic cancer cell lines DU145 , PC3 , P03886 , ALVA31 and JCA1 released soluble P16070 molecules and DU145 , PC3 and P03886 released soluble CD54 . Both soluble and surface P16070 were not found in LNCaP , and both forms of CD54 were not expressed in LNCaP and JCA1 . CD54 was found to be highly expressed on cell surface in ALVA31 , but these cells did not release soluble CD54 . Expression of both cell surface and soluble forms were examined after treatment of cells with P01579 , TGF-beta 1 , or culturing in serum-free media . The concentration of soluble CD54 in supernatants changed to small extent after treatment with TGF-beta 1 and increased after treatment with P01579 or in serum-free media . Cell surface expression of CD54 however , changed only minimally after treatment . The levels of cell surface and soluble P16070 also changed minimally after treatment with P01579 and TGF-beta 1 but decreased in serum-free media and this was accompanied by marked elevation of soluble P16070 in supernatants . These data indicate that soluble P16070 might be released from cell surface by shedding whereas alternative splicing is the most likely mechanism of soluble CD54 release .
