[ Genetics and pharmacogenetics of osteoporosis ] . Osteoporosis is a serious disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality due to atraumatic fractures . In pathogenesis of osteoporosis , except environment , internal factors , such as hormonal dysbalance and genetic background , are also in play . In this review , candidate genes for osteoporosis are classified according to metabolic or hormonal pathways , which regulate bone mineral density/and or quality ( estrogen , O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 / O00300 , mevalonate , Wnt circuit , genes for collagen and vitamin D ) . Authors discuss the perspectives of practical utilization of pharmacogenetics ( identification of single candidate genes using PCR ) or pharmacogenomics ( using genome wide association studies ) in choice of optimal treatment of osteoporosis . Potentional predictors of effectivity of antiresorption therapy are genes ER , P14324 , Cyp19A1 , P11473 , Col1A1 and gene of Wnt pathway . Moreover , polymorphisms of CYP2C gene , but also P14324 may identify patients with high risk of undesirable effects of bisphosphonates ( osteonecrosis of jaw ) . Unfortunately , results of the most association studies has not been confirmed by other investigators . The controversial results could be explained by different methodic approaches in individual studies ( different sample size , homogenity of investigated groups , ethnic differences or linkage disquilibrium between genes ) . Key cliff of association studies is low variability ( 7-10 % ) of bone phenotypes associated with investigated genes . Nevertheless , identification of new genes and verification their association with bone density and/or quality using both PCR and genome wide association studies remain to be a great challenge targeting optimal prevention and treatment of osteoporosis .
