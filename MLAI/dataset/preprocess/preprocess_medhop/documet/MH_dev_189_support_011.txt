P11274 - P00519 suppresses C/EBPalpha expression through inhibitory action of Q15366 . The arrest of differentiation is a feature of both chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in myeloid blast crisis and myeloid precursors that ectopically express the p210BCR- P00519 oncoprotein ; however , its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood . Here we show that expression of P11274 - P00519 in myeloid precursor cells leads to transcriptional suppression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor Q99062 ( encoded by Q99062 ) , possibly through down-modulation of C/EBPalpha-the principal regulator of granulocytic differentiation . Expression of C/EBPalpha protein is barely detectable in primary marrow cells taken from individuals affected with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis . In contrast , P49715 RNA is clearly present . Ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha induces granulocytic differentiation of myeloid precursor cells expressing P11274 - P00519 . Expression of C/EBPalpha is suppressed at the translational level by interaction of the poly(rC)-binding protein Q15366 with P49715 mRNA , and ectopic expression of Q15366 in myeloid precursor cells down-regulates both C/EBPalpha and Q99062 and leads to rapid cell death on treatment with DB00099 ( encoded by P09919 ) . Our results indicate that P11274 - P00519 regulates the expression of C/EBPalpha by inducing Q15366 -which inhibits the translation of P49715 mRNA .
