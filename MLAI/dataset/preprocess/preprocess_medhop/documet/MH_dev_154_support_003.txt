A pleiotropic antiatherogenic action of ibuprofen . Ibuprofen is a cyclooxygenase ( P23219 and P35354 ) inhibitor known to reduce the production of prostaglandins that play prominent role in inflammation . Other properties of the drug , aside from its anti-inflammatory effects , have been recently studied . In this paper we shall discuss several properties of ibuprofen that making the drug interesting for treatment of conditions associated with atherosclerosis . Ibuprofen exerts pleiotropic effects such as inhibition of adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes , suppressing intracellular production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative modification of LDL . Interestingly , ibuprofen increased HDL cholesterol levels and reduced the level of triglicerides . Ibuprofen can also modulate efficiency of fibrynolisis by inhibiting production of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) . This properties of ibuprofen may be due to changing the activity of transcription factors . Ibuprofen inhibits the activation of NF-kB and activates PPARa and PPARg .
