Neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities of atorvastatin in a rat chronic constriction injury model . DB01076 is an P04035 inhibitor used to treat hypercholesterolemic conditions associated with hypertension . This study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin on peripheral neuropathic pain . Peripheral neuropathic pain was induced by chronic constriction injury ( CCI ) in Sprague-Dawley rats . Rats were divided into 3 groups including sham-operated , CCI , and atorvastatin-treated . DB01076 ( 10 mg/kg ) or phosphate-buffered saline was orally administered for 2 weeks . All animals were assessed by neurobehavioral tests before surgery and at days 3 , 7 , 14 after surgery . Inflammatory and neuroprotective factors were evaluated by Western blot analysis . P29474 , P35354 and P35228 in the sciatic nerve were also studied using immunohistochemistry . DB01076 attenuated CCI-induced nociceptive sensitization and thermal hyperalgesia in a time-dependent manner . DB01076 improved CCI-induced neurobehavioral/inflammatory activity by inhibition of TGF-beta , pIkB/IkB , NFkB , P35354 , P35228 , EP1 and EP4 in the sciatic nerve . DB01076 was also found to increase neuroprotection factors pAkt/Akt , P29474 and P15692 . Taken together , these data indicate that atorvastatin could protect the sciatic nerve against CCI-induced neuroinflammation and nociception .
