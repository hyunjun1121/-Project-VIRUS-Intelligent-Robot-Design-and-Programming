Predictive value of circulating interleukin-6 and heart-type fatty acid binding protein for three months clinical outcome in acute cerebral infarction : multiple blood markers profiling study . INTRODUCTION : There is no single blood marker for predicting the prognosis in ischemic stroke . A combination of multiple blood markers may enhance the ability to predict long-term outcome following ischemic stroke . METHODS : Blood concentrations of neuronal markers ( neuron-specific enolase , visinin-like protein 1 , heart type fatty acid binding protein ( hFABP ) and neuroglobin ) , astroglial markers ( P04271 and glial fibrillary acidic protein ) , inflammatory markers ( P05231 , P01375 -Î± , and P02741 ) , blood-brain barrier marker ( matrix metalloproteinase 9 ) , and haemostatic markers ( D-dimer and P05121 ) were measured within 24 hours after stroke onset . The discrimination and reclassification for favorable and poor outcome were compared after adding individual or a combination of blood markers to the clinical model of stroke outcome . RESULTS : In multivariate analysis , natural log-transformed ( log ) P05231 ( odds ratio ( OR ) : 1.75 , 95 % CI : 1.25 to 2.25 , P=0.001 ) and loghFABP ( OR : 3.23 , 95 % CI : 1.44 to 7.27 , P=0.005 ) were independently associated with poor outcome . The addition of a single blood marker to the clinical model did not improve the discriminating ability of the clinical model of stroke outcome . However , the addition of the combination of logIL-6 and loghFABP to the clinical model showed improved discrimination ( area under receiver operating characteristic ( AUROC ) curve : 0.939 versus 0.910 , P=0.03 ) and reclassification performance ( net reclassification improvement index : 0.18 , P=0.005 ) . CONCLUSIONS : A combination of circulating P05231 and hFABP level has an additive clinical value for the prediction of stroke outcome .
