Dysregulated P04629 signalling is a therapeutic target in Q9NQC7 defective tumours . Individuals with germline mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene Q9NQC7 are at high risk of developing disfiguring cutaneous appendageal tumours , the defining tumour being the highly organised cylindroma . Here , we analysed Q9NQC7 mutant tumour genomes by array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression microarray analysis . Q9NQC7 mutant tumours were characterised by an absence of copy-number aberrations apart from LOH chromosome 16q , the genomic location of the Q9NQC7 gene . Gene expression profiling of Q9NQC7 mutant tumours showed dysregulated tropomyosin kinase ( P04629 ) signalling , with overexpression of Q16620 and Q16288 in tumours when compared with perilesional skin . Immunohistochemical analysis of a tumour microarray showed strong membranous Q16620 and Q16288 staining in cylindromas , as well as elevated levels of P29323 phosphorylation and P10415 expression . Membranous Q16288 overexpression was also observed in 70 % of sporadic BCCs . RNA interference-mediated silencing of Q16620 and Q16288 , as well as treatment with the small-molecule P04629 inhibitor lestaurtinib , reduced colony formation and proliferation in 3D primary cell cultures established from Q9NQC7 mutant tumours . These results suggest that P04629 inhibition could be used as a strategy to treat tumours with loss of functional Q9NQC7 .
