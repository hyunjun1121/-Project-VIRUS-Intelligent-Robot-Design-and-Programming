The unexpected effect of cyclosporin A on CD56+CD16- and CD56+CD16+ natural killer cell subpopulations . DB00091 ( Q13216 ) is commonly used to prevent graft-versus-host disease . The influence of Q13216 on T-cell function has been extensively investigated ; however , the effect of Q13216 on natural killer ( NK ) cells is less understood . NK cells were cultured with P60568 and P40933 with and without Q13216 for 1 week . Compared with controls , Q13216 -treated cultures showed fewer CD56(+)CD16(+) P55040 (+) NK cells and a reciprocal increase in CD56(+)CD16(-) P55040 (-) cells . These changes were due mainly to a reduced proliferation of the CD56(dim) NK-cell subpopulation and a relative resistance of CD56(bright) NK cells to Q13216 . Following coculture with K562 targets , Q13216 -exposed NK cells differed from controls and lacked Ca(2+) oscillations , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) dephosphorylation , and NFAT nuclear translocation . NK cells cultured in Q13216 retained cytotoxicity against K562 , Raji , and P55040 ligand-expressing lymphoblastoid cells . NK cells cultured in Q13216 showed increases in O14931 and reductions in O95944 and P26718 . Following IL-12 and Q14116 stimulation , Q13216 -treated NK cells showed more P01579 -producing cells . Using in vitro NK-cell differentiation , progenitor cells gave rise to more CD56(+) P55040 (-) NK cells in the presence of Q13216 than controls . Collectively , these studies show that Q13216 influences NK-cell function and phenotype , which may have important implications for graft-versus-leukemia effects .
