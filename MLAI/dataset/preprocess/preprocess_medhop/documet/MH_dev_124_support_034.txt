Antagonistic action of novel 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26 , 23-lactone analogs on differentiation of human leukemia cells ( HL-60 ) induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . We examined the effects of two novel 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone ( 1alpha,25-lactone ) analogues on human promyelocytic leukemia cell ( HL-60 ) differentiation using the evaluation system of the vitamin D nuclear receptor ( P11473 ) /vitamin D-responsive element ( DRE ) -mediated genomic action stimulated by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( DB00136 ) and its analogues . We found that the 1alpha,25-lactone analogues ( 23S ) -25-dehydro-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone ( TEI-9647 ) , and ( 23R ) -25-dehydro-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone ( TEI-9648 ) bound much more strongly to the P11473 than the natural ( 23S , 25R ) - DB00136 -26,23-lactone , but did not induce cell differentiation even at high concentrations ( 10(-6) M ) . Intriguingly , the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by DB00136 was inhibited by either TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 but not by the natural lactone . In contrast , retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced HL-60 cell differentiation was not blocked by TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 . In separate studies , TEI-9647 ( 10(-7) M ) was found to be an effective antagonist of both DB00136 ( 10(-8) M ) mediated induction of P38936 ( P38936 , CIP1 ) in HL-60 cells and activation of the luciferase reporter assay in COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA containing the DRE of the rat DB00146 -24-hydroxylase gene and cDNA of the human P11473 . Collectively the results strongly suggest that our novel 1alpha,25-lactone analogues , TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 , are specific antagonists of 1alpha , 25(OH)2D3 action , specifically P11473 /DRE-mediated genomic action . As such , they represent the first examples of antagonists , which act on the nuclear P11473 .
