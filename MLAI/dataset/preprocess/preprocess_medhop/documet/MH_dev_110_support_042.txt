Effect of Nelumbo nucifera Petal Extracts on Lipase , Adipogenesis , Adipolysis , and Central Receptors of Obesity . N. nucifera is one among the important medicinal plants assessed for its antiobesity action in various preclinical models . The present study was aimed at investigating the antiobesity effect of methanol and successive water extracts of petals of N. nucifera by studying its effect on adipogenesis , adipolysis , lipase , serotonin ( P28335 ) , cannabinoid ( P34972 ) , melanocyte concentrating hormone ( Q99705 ) , and melanocortin ( P32245 ) receptors . Both methanol and successive water extracts of N. nucifera petals had an effect on inhibition of lipid storage in adipocytes and on increasing lipolysis . N. nucifera petal methanol extract exhibited the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on lipase activity with an IC50 value of 47 Âµg/mL . N. nucifera petal extracts showed evident agonist and antagonist activity towards P28335 and P34972 receptors , respectively , while it showed no effect towards Q99705 and P32245 receptors . Overall , methanol extract of N. nucifera petals showed better activity than successive water extract .
