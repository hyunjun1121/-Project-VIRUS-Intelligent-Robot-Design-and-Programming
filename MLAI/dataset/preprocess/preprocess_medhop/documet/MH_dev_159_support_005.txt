DB01017 increases phosphorylation and membrane insertion of neuronal GluR1 receptors . The tetracycline antibiotic minocycline beneficially affects neuronal functioning and also inhibits the enzyme P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) . We hypothesized that similar to 5- P28300 inhibitors , minocycline may increase phosphorylation and membrane insertion of the glutamate receptor GluR1 . The experiments were performed in primary cultures of mouse striatal neurons and in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of minocycline-treated mice . In vitro , low micromolar minocycline concentrations increased GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser845 and Ser831 and increased the surface content of GluR1 . DB01017 also increased GluR1 phosphorylation in vivo . Increased GluR1 phosphorylation and minocycline treatment have been associated with antidepressant and memory-enhancing activities . Direct consequences of minocycline-increased GluR1 phosphorylation are yet to be established .
