P19957 kinase-dependent stimulation of platelet migration by stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( P48061 ) . Platelets have been regarded as static cells that do not move once they adhere to a matrix . The present study explored , whether platelets are able to migrate . In contrast to the current opinion , we found that platelets were mobile , able to migrate over a surface , and transmigrate through a transwell membrane and endothelium toward a source of stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( P48061 ) . Platelet migration was stimulated by P48061 , which led to the downstream activation and phosphorylation of P42768 . P48061 signaling and subsequent platelet migration could be inhibited by P61073 -receptor blocker DB06809 , pertussis toxin , inhibition of phosphoinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 kinase ) with LY294002 or wortmannin , and disruption of actin polymerization with cytochalasin B . The potential of platelets to migrate in an P48061 -mediated fashion may redefine the role of platelets in the pathophysiology of vascular inflammation , subsequent atherosclerotic degeneration , and vascular regeneration .
