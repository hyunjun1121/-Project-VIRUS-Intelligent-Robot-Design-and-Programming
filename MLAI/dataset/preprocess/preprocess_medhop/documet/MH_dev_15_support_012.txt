Germline P07949 634 mutation positive MEN 2A-related C-cell hyperplasias have genetic features consistent with intraepithelial neoplasia . C-cell hyperplasias are normally multifocal in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A . We compared clonality , microsatellite pattern of tumor suppressor genes , and cellular kinetics of C-cell hyperplasia foci in each thyroid lobe . We selected 11 females from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred treated with thyroidectomy due to hypercalcitoninemia . C-cell hyperplasia foci were microdissected for DNA extraction to analyze the methylation pattern of androgen receptor alleles and microsatellite regions ( P04637 , P06400 , P19544 , and P21359 ) . Consecutive sections were selected for MIB-1 , pRB1 , p53 , Mdm-2 , and p21WAF1 immunostaining , DNA content analysis , and in situ end labeling . Appropriate tissue controls were run . Only two patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma foci . Nine informative C-cell hyperplasia patients showed germline point mutation in P07949 , eight of them with the same androgen receptor allele preferentially methylated in both lobes . C-cell hyperplasia foci showed heterogeneous DNA deletions revealed by loss of heterozygosity of P04637 ( 12 of 20 ) , P06400 ( 6 of 14 ) , and P19544 ( 4 of 20 ) and hypodiploid G0/ P55008 cells ( 14 of 20 ) , low cellular turnover ( MIB-1 index 4.5 % , in situ end labeling index 0.03 % ) , and significantly high nuclear area to DNA index ratio . MEN 2A ( germline point mutation in P07949 codon 634 ) C-cell hyperplasias are monoclonal and genetically heterogeneous and show down-regulated apoptosis , findings consistent with an intraepithelial neoplasia . Concordant X-chromosome inactivation and interstitial gene deletions suggest clone expansions of precursors occurring at a point in embryonic development before divergence of each thyroid lobe and may represent a paradigm for other germline mutations .
