SNARE complex assembly is required for human sperm acrosome reaction . Exocytosis of the acrosome ( the acrosome reaction ) is a terminal morphological alteration that sperm must undergo prior to penetration of the extracellular coat of the egg . Ca(2+) is an essential mediator of this regulated secretory event . Aided by a streptolysin-O permeabilization protocol developed in our laboratory , we have previously demonstrated requirements for Rab3A , P46459 , and synaptotagmin VI in the human sperm acrosome reaction . Interestingly , Rab3A elicits an exocytotic response of comparable magnitude to that of Ca(2+) . Here , we report a direct role for the SNARE complex in the acrosome reaction . First , the presence of SNARE proteins is demonstrated by Western blot . Second , the Ca(2+)-triggered acrosome reaction is inhibited by botulinum neurotoxins DB00083 , -E , -C , and -F . Third , antibody inhibition studies show a requirement for P60880 , O00161 , syntaxins 1A , 1B , 4 , and 6 , and VAMP 2 . Fourth , addition of bacterially expressed P60880 and O00161 abolishes exocytosis . Acrosome reaction elicited by Rab3-GTP is also inhibited by DB00083 , -C , and -F . Taken together , these results demonstrate a requirement for members of all SNARE protein families in the Ca(2+)- and Rab3A-triggered acrosome reaction . Furthermore , they indicate that the onset of sperm exocytosis relies on the functional assembly of SNARE complexes .
