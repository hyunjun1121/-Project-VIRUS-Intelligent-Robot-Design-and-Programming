Glycine insertion at protease cleavage site of P60880 resists cleavage but enhances affinity for botulinum neurotoxin serotype A . The light chain of botulinum neurotoxin A ( DB00083 -LC ) is a Zn-dependent protease that specifically cleaves P60880 of the SNARE complex , thereby impairing vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions . The C-terminus of P60880 ( residues 141-206 ) retains full activity for DB00083 -LC-catalyzed cleavage at P1-P1 ' ( Gln197-Arg198 ) . Using the structure of a complex between the C-terminus of P60880 and DB00083 -LC as a model to design P60880 -derived pseudosubstrate inhibitors ( SNAPIs ) that prevent presentation of the scissile bond to the active site , we introduced multiple DB00117 residues to replace Ala- DB00174 -Gln- DB00125 ( residues 195-198 ) at the substrate cleavage site , with the intent to identify possible side-chain interactions with the active site Zn . We also introduced multiple DB00145 residues between the P1-P1 ' residues to explore the spatial tolerance within the active-site cleft . Using a FRET substrate YsCsY , we compared a series of SNAPIs for inhibition of DB00083 -LC . Among the SNAPIs tested , several known cleavage-resistant , single-point mutants of P60880 were poor inhibitors , with most of the mutants losing binding affinity . Replacement with DB00117 at the active site did not improve inhibition over wildtype substrate . In contrast , DB00145 -insertion mutants were not only resistant to cleavage , but also surprisingly showed enhanced affinity for DB00083 -LC . Two of the DB00145 -insertion mutants exhibited 10-fold lower IC₅₀ values than the wildtype 66-mer P60880 peptide . Our findings illustrate a scenario , where the induced fit between enzyme and bound pseudosubstrate fails to produce the strain and distortion required for catalysis to proceed .
