DB04365 -induced phosphorylated p53 and P38936 ( P38936 ) protein expression is dependent on Q13315 /ATR and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase in clone-9 cells . Betel-quid use is associated with liver cancer whereas its constituent arecoline is cytotoxic , genotoxic , and induces p53-dependent P38936 ( P38936 ) protein expression in Clone-9 cells ( rat hepatocytes ) . The ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ) /rad3-related ( ATR ) -p53- P38936 ( P38936 ) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) -mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathways are involved in the DNA damage response and the pathogenesis of cancers . Thus , we studied the role of Q13315 /ATR and PI3K in arecoline-induced p53 and P38936 ( P38936 ) protein expression in Clone-9 cells . We found that arecoline ( 0.5 mM ) activated the Q13315 /ATR kinase at 30 min . The arecoline-activated Q13315 /ATR substrate contained p-p53Ser15 . Moreover , arecoline only increased the levels of the p-p53Ser6 , p-p53Ser15 , and p-p53Ser392 phosphorylated p53 isoforms among the known isoforms . Q13315 shRNA attenuated arecoline-induced p-p53Ser15 and P38936 ( P38936 ) at 24 h . DB04365 ( 0.5 mM ) increased phosphorylation levels of p-AktSer473 and p-mTORSer2448 at 30-60 min . Dominant-negative PI3K plasmids attenuated arecoline-induced P38936 ( P38936 ) , but not p-p53Ser15 , at 24 h . DB00877 attenuated arecoline-induced phosphrylated p-p53Ser15 , but not P38936 ( P38936 ) , at 24 h . Q13315 shRNA , but not dominant-negative PI3K plasmids , attenuated arecoline-induced P38936 ( P38936 ) gene transcription . We conclude that arecoline activates the Q13315 /ATR-p53- P38936 ( P38936 ) and the PI3K/Akt- P42345 -p53 pathways in Clone-9 cells . DB04365 -induced phosphorylated p-p53Ser15 expression is dependent on Q13315 whereas arecoline-induced P38936 ( P38936 ) protein expression is dependent on Q13315 and PI3K . Moreover , P38936 ( P38936 ) gene is transcriptionally induced by arecoline-activated Q13315 .
