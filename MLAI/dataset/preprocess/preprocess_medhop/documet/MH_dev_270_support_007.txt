Pituitary-adrenal axis regulation in P06850 -deficient mice . P06850 ( P06850 ) -deficient ( knockout ( KO ) ) mice demonstrate severely impaired adrenal responses to restraint , ether , and fasting , and lack the normal diurnal glucocorticoid ( GC ) rhythm . Here , we summarize recent studies determining the role of P06850 in augmenting plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( DB01285 ) concentration after glucocorticoid withdrawal and pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation in the context of inflammation . Even though GC insufficient , basal pituitary proopiomelanocortin ( P01189 ) mRNA , DB01285 peptide content within the pituitary , and plasma DB01285 concentrations are not elevated in P06850 KO mice . P01189 mRNA content in P06850 KO mice increases following adrenalectomy , and this increase is reversed by GC , but not aldosterone , replacement . In marked contrast to the increase in P01189 mRNA , plasma DB01285 does not increase in the P06850 KO mice following adrenalectomy . Administration of P06850 to adrenalectomized P06850 KO mice results in acute , robust DB01285 secretion . Thus , loss of GC feedback can increase P01189 gene expression in the pituitary , but P06850 action is essential for increased secretion of DB01285 into the circulation . While GC secretion is impaired in P06850 KO mice after most stimuli , we have found near-normal GC responses to inflammation and systemic immune challenge . Studies in mice with P06850 and P05231 deficiency reveal that P05231 is essential for activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis during inflammatory and other stressors in the absence of P06850 .
