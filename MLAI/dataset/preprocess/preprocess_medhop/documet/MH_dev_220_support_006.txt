Archaebacterial elongation factor is ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin . Archaebacteria have been defined as a ' third primary kingdom ' of cells in addition to the urkaryotes and the eubacteria . While the latter two correspond approximately to the conventional categories eukaryotes and prokaryotes respectively , the Archaebacteria have up to now comprised four groups of microorganisms : the methanogenic bacteria , the extremely halophilic bacteria and the two thermoacidophilic genera Sulfolobus and Thermoplasma . Based on ribosomal RNA sequence homologies and lipid composition , they apparently form a distinct group . Furthermore they possess or lack typical biochemical markers of both the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes , as well as having unique properties not found elsewhere . Altogether , this indicates that they are not closer to either one of the classical categories . One clear-cut difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the diphtheria toxin reaction , which catalyses the covalent binding of adenosine diphosphate-ribose ( DB02059 ) to the eukaryotic peptide elongation factor P13639 in contrast to the homologous prokaryotic factor EF-G . We report here that diphtheria toxin also catalyses the ADP-riboslation of archaebacterial elongation factors . In this respect , these factors have to be assigned to the P13639 type ; we suppose that the ADP-ribosylatable structure arising so early in evolution is of fundamental importance for the elongation process .
