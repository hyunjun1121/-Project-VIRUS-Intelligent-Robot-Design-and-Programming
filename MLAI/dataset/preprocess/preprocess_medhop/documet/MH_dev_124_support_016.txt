Development of an osteoblast/osteoclast co-culture derived by human bone marrow stromal cells and human monocytes for biomaterials testing . The communication of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts is a fundamental requirement for balanced bone remodelling . For biomaterial research , development of in vitro models is necessary to investigate this communication . In the present study human bone marrow stromal cells and human monocytes were cultivated in order to differentiate into osteoblasts and osteoclasts , respectively . Finally , a cultivation regime was identified which firstly induces the differentiation of the human bone marrow stromal cells followed by the induction of osteoclastogenesis through the osteoblasts formed -- without the external addition of the factors O14788 and P09603 . As a feedback on osteoblasts enhanced gene expression of P21815 was detected for modifications which facilitated the formation of large multinuclear osteoclasts . Phenotype characterization was performed by biochemical methods ( DNA , LDH , ALP , TRAP 5b ) , gene expression analysis ( ALP , P21815 , O14788 , P05231 , VTNR , P43235 , TRAP , Q8IYS5 , P30988 ) as well as light microscopy , confocal laser scanning microscopy , and scanning electron microscopy . After establishing this model on polystyrene , similar positive results were obtained for cultivation on a relevant bone substitution material -- a composite xerogel of silica , collagen , and calcium phosphate .
