Regulation of P29474 -derived superoxide by endogenous methylarginines . The endogenous methylarginines , asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) and N ( G ) -monomethyl- l-arginine ( L-NMMA ) regulate nitric oxide ( NO ) production from endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) . Under conditions of tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH 4 ) depletion P29474 also generates (*)O 2 ( - ) ; however , the effects of methylarginines on P29474 -derived (*)O 2 ( - ) generation are poorly understood . Therefore , using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping techniques we measured the dose-dependent effects of DB01686 and L-NMMA on (*)O 2 ( - ) production from P29474 under conditions of BH 4 depletion . In the absence of BH 4 , DB01686 dose-dependently increased NOS-derived (*)O 2 ( - ) generation , with a maximal increase of 151 % at 100 microM DB01686 . L-NMMA also dose-dependently increased NOS-derived (*)O 2 ( - ) , but to a lesser extent , demonstrating a 102 % increase at 100 microM L-NMMA . Moreover , the native substrate l-arginine also increased P29474 -derived (*)O 2 ( - ) , exhibiting a similar degree of enhancement as that observed with DB01686 . Measurements of NADPH consumption from P29474 demonstrated that binding of either l-arginine or methylarginines increased the rate of NADPH oxidation . Spectrophotometric studies suggest , just as for l-arginine and L-NMMA , the binding of DB01686 shifts the P29474 heme to the high-spin state , indicative of a more positive heme redox potential , enabling enhanced electron transfer from the reductase to the oxygenase site . These results demonstrate that the methylarginines can profoundly shift the balance of NO and (*)O 2 ( - ) generation from P29474 . These observations have important implications with regard to the therapeutic use of l-arginine and the methylarginine-NOS inhibitors in the treatment of disease .
