Extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinases block internalization of delta-opioid receptors . Translocation of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) from the cell membrane to cytosol depends on the kind of ligand activating the receptor . This principle is clearly demonstrated for opioid receptors , because diverse opiate agonists rapidly induce receptor internalization , whereas morphine almost fails . We report here the impact of mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase isoforms extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 on the internalization of delta-opioid receptors ( DORs ) expressed in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 )293 cells . Receptor activation by etorphine turned out to transiently phosphorylate P29323 / Q96HU1 kinases and bring about Q8IXH6 internalization within 20 min . In contrast , prolonged exposure of HEK293 cells to morphine excited persistent phosphorylation of P29323 / Q96HU1 kinases , and those cells failed to internalize the opioid receptor . When P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase phosphorylation was blocked by 2'-Amino-3'-methoxyflavone ( PD98059 ) , morphine gained the ability to strongly induce Q8IXH6 endocytosis . The importance of activated Q96HU1 kinases for Q8IXH6 internalization is further demonstrated by glutamate and paclitaxel because these substances induce phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and concomitantly prevent Q8IXH6 sequestration by etorphine . In addition , receptor internalization by morphine was facilitated by inhibition of protein kinase C and opioid-mediated transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , both activating P29323 / Q96HU1 kinases by opioids . The mechanism affording Q8IXH6 internalization by PD98059 may relate to arrestin , which uncouples GPCRs and thus triggers receptor internalization . Arrestin considerably translocates toward the cell membrane upon Q8IXH6 activation by morphine in presence of the Q96HU1 kinase blocker , but it fails in the absence of PD98059 . We conclude that P29323 / Q96HU1 kinase activity prevents opioid receptor desensitization and sequestration by blocking arrestin 2 interaction with activated DORs .
