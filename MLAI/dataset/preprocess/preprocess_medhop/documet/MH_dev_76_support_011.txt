S-sulfhydration of Q02750 leads to P09874 activation and DNA damage repair . The repair of DNA damage is fundamental to normal cell development and replication . Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) is a novel gasotransmitter that has been reported to protect cellular aging . Here , we show that H2S attenuates DNA damage in human endothelial cells and fibroblasts by S-sulfhydrating Q02750 at cysteine 341 , which leads to P09874 activation . H2S-induced Q02750 S-sulfhydration facilitates the translocation of phosphorylated P27361 /2 into nucleus , where it activates P09874 through direct interaction . Mutation of Q02750 cysteine 341 inhibits P29323 phosphorylation and P09874 activation . In the presence of H2S , activated P09874 recruits P18887 and P49916 to DNA breaks to mediate DNA damage repair , and cells are protected from senescence .
