P21554 regulates P29323 and GSK-3β-dependent glucocorticoid inhibition of osteoblast differentiation in murine MC3T3-E1 cells . Supraphysiological glucocorticoid administration accelerates loss of survival and differentiation in osteoblastic cells , thereby increasing the risks of osteopenic or osteonecrotic disorders . Neuroendocrine component type 1 cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) is found to regulate bone mass . This study characterized the biological role of P21554 in glucocorticoid-induced suppression of osteoblast differentiation . Murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were incubated under osteogenic conditions in the presence or absence of 1 μM glucocorticoid , RNA interference , P21554 antagonist AM251 , and agonist WIN55212-2 . Cell survival was detected by formazan synthesis and TUNEL staining . Osteoblast differentiation was quantified by mineralized matrix accumulation and expression of the osteogenic factors Runx2 and osteocalcin . Expression of signaling molecules was assessed by immunoblotting . Glucocorticoid increased P21554 expression in association with decreased osteocalcin expression and mineralized nodule deposition . P21554 RNA interference and AM251 attenuated the deleterious actions of glucocorticoid treatment on survival and osteogenic activities , whereas activating P21554 by WIN55212-2 impaired osteoblast differentiation . P21554 signaling regulated JNK , P29323 , GSK-3β , and Akt activation as well as Runx2 and P05019 expression . Inhibition of GSK-3β by the kinase-inactive GSK-3β mutant or activation of P29323 by the active MEK-1 mutant abrogated glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation . Glucocorticoid-induced P21554 expression occurred via glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional and translational regulation . Gain of Runx2 function and loss of P28562 action attenuated glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of P21554 expression . Taken together , P21554 regulation of P29323 and GSK-3β-dependent pathways participates in glucocorticoid inhibition of Runx2 signaling and osteoblast differentiation . Runx2 reciprocally regulates glucocorticoid-induced promotion of P21554 signaling . Our findings provide new insights into the role of the neuroendocrine component P21554 in glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast dysfunction .
