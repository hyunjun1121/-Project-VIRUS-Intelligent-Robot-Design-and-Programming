Mycoplasma superantigen initiates a O00206 -dependent Th17 cascade that enhances arthritis after blocking P33681 -1 in Mycoplasma arthritidis-infected mice . Mycoplasma arthritidis is a natural pathogen of rodents causing arthritis , toxic shock and necrotizing fasciitis . It secretes a potent superantigen ( SAg ) , MAM , that differentially affects the immune system depending upon presence or absence of O00206 , thus potentially influencing disease outcomes . Here , we establish that antibody to co-stimulatory molecule P33681 -1( P33681 ) enhances arthritis in wild-type C3H/HeSnJ ( O60603 +4+ ) mice but suppresses arthritis in O00206 -defect C3H/HeJ ( O60603 +4- ) mice . Also , blockade of the P33681 -1/ P10747 co-stimulatory pathway in C3H/HeSnJ mice resulted in a marked increase in an alternative co-stimulatory pathway Q9Y6W8 / O75144 that was associated with elevation of the Q16552 /Th17cascade with enhanced IL-23 , P05231 , and the RORÎ³t and P40763 transcriptional factors on P01730 + T cells . Anti- P33681 -1 also increased inflammatory chemokines and the stress protein P09429 that promotes cellular infiltration to joints . Using a MAM-deficient strain of M. arthritidis , a monoclonal antibody to O00206 and a O00206 -defective mouse strain , we established that both MAM and O00206 are required for the systemic and local joint triggering of the Th17/ Q16552 cascade in mice treated with anti- P33681 -1 antibody . Importantly , blocking of Q16552 with anti- Q16552 antibody suppressed the elevated arthritis in M. arthritidis-infected mice treated with anti- P33681 -1 antibody . Thus , this unique model of arthritis illustrates how microbial agonists can bridgeinnate and adaptive immune responses to redirect signalling pathways , thus promoting chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease .
