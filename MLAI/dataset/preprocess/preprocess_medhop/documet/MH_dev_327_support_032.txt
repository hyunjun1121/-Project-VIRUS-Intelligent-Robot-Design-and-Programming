P06746 bypasses in vitro a single d(GpG)-cisplatin adduct placed on codon 13 of the P01112 gene . We have examined the capacity of calf thymus DNA polymerases alpha , beta , delta , and epsilon to perform in vitro translesion synthesis on a substrate containing a single d(GpG)-cisplatin adduct placed on codon 13 of the human P01112 gene . We found that DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases alpha , delta , and epsilon was blocked at the base preceding the lesion . Addition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen to DNA polymerase delta and replication protein A to DNA polymerase alpha did not restore their capacity to elongate past the adduct . On the other hand , P06746 efficiently bypassed the cisplatin adduct . Furthermore , we observed that P06746 was the only polymerase capable of primer extension of a 3'-OH located opposite the base preceding the lesion . Likewise , P06746 was able to elongate the arrested replication products of the other three DNA polymerases , thus showing its capacity to successfully compete with polymerases alpha , delta , and epsilon in the stalled replication complex . Our data suggest ( i ) a possible mechanism enabling P06746 to bypass a d(GpG)-cisplatin adduct in vitro and ( ii ) a role for this enzyme in processing DNA damage in vivo .
