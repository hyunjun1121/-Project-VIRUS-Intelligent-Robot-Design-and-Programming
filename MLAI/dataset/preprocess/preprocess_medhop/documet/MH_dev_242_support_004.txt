Structural differences between Pb2+- and Ca2+-binding sites in proteins : implications with respect to toxicity . Pb(2+) is known to displace physiologically-relevant metal ions in proteins . To investigate potential relationships between Pb(2+)/protein complexes and toxicity , data from the protein data bank were analyzed to compare structural properties of Pb(2+)- and Ca(2+)-binding sites . Results of this analysis reveal that the majority of Pb(2+) sites ( 77.1 % ) involve 2-5 binding ligands , compared with 6+/-2 for non-EF-Hand and 7+/-1 for EF-Hand Ca(2+)-binding sites . The mean net negative charge by site ( 1.7 ) fell between values noted for non-EF-Hand ( 1+/-1 ) and EF-Hand ( 3+/-1 ) . DB09140 is the dominant ligand for both Pb(2+) and Ca(2+) , but Pb(2+) binds predominantly with sidechain DB00142 ( 38.4 % ) , which is less prevalent in both non-EF-Hand ( 10.4 % ) and EF-Hand ( 26.6 % ) Ca(2+)-binding sites . A comparison of binding geometries where Pb(2+) has replaced Ca(2+) in calmodulin ( P62158 ) and Zn(2+) in 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase ( P13716 ) revealed protein structural changes that appear to be unrelated to ionic displacement . Structural changes observed with P62158 may be related to opportunistic binding of Pb(2+) in regions of high electrostatic charge , whereas P13716 may bind multiple Pb(2+) ions in the active site . These results suggest that Pb(2+) adapts to structurally-diverse binding geometries and that opportunistic binding may play an active role in molecular metal toxicity .
