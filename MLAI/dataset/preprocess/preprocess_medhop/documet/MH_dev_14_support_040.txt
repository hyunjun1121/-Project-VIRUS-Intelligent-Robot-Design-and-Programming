Contribution of captopril thiol group to the prevention of spontaneous hypertension . We aimed to compare the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors captopril ( containing thiol group ) and enalapril ( without thiol group ) on the development of spontaneous hypertension and to analyze mechanisms of their actions , particularly effects on oxidative stress and NO production . Six-week-old SHR were divided into three groups : control , group receiving captopril ( 50 mg/kg/day ) or enalapril ( 50 mg/kg/day ) for 6 weeks . At the end of experiment , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 41 % in controls . Both captopril and enalapril prevented blood pressure increase , however , SBP in the captopril group ( 121+/-5 mmHg ) was significantly lower than that in the enalapril group ( 140+/-5 mmHg ) . Concentration of conjugated dienes in the aorta was significantly lower in the captopril group compared to the enalapril group . DB01197 and enalapril increased NO synthase activity in the heart and aorta to the similar level . Neither captopril nor enalapril was , however , able to increase the expression of P29474 . Both P12821 inhibitors increased the level of cGMP . However , cGMP level was significantly higher in the aorta of captopril group . We conclude that captopril , beside inhibition of P12821 , prevented hypertension by increasing NO synthase activity and by simultaneous decrease of oxidative stress which resulted in increase of cGMP concentration .
