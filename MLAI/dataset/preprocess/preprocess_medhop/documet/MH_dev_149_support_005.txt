The antiangiogenic effects of a vascular endothelial growth factor decoy receptor can be monitored in vivo using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging . The development of antiangiogenic therapies has stimulated interest in noninvasive imaging methods to monitor response . We investigated whether the effects of a vascular endothelial growth factor decoy receptor ( DB08885 , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Tarrytown , NY ) could be monitored in vivo using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS ) . Twenty nude mice ( in two groups ) were implanted with a human melanoma cell line ( DB-1 ) . The active group received DB08885 ( 4 × 25 mg/kg over 2 weeks ) , whereas the control group received an inactive protein . An ultrasound contrast agent was injected followed by power Doppler imaging ( P07237 ) and pulse inversion harmonic imaging ( PIHI ; regular and intermittent ) . Specimens were sectioned in the same planes as the images and stained for endothelial cells ( CD31 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , P15692 , and hypoxia ( Glut1 ) . Measures of tumor vascularity obtained with the different imaging modes were compared to immunohistochemical markers of angiogenesis . Mean tumor volume was smaller in the active group than in the control group ( 656 ± 225 vs 1,160 ± 605 mm3 ) . Overall , P07237 and P15692 correlated ( r = .34 ; p = .037 ) . Vascularity decreased from control to treated mice with intermittent PIHI , as did the expression of CD31 and P35354 ( p ≤ .02 ) , whereas P15692 increased ( p = .05 ) . CEUS appears to allow in vivo monitoring of the antiangiogenic effects of DB08885 in the DB-1 human melanoma xenograft model .
