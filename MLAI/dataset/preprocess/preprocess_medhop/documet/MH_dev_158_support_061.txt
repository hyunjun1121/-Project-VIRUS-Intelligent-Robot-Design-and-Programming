P62937 and P62942 interact with P25490 and alter its transcriptional activity . P25490 is a zinc finger transcription factor with unusual structural and functional features . In a yeast two-hybrid screen , two cellular proteins , cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) and FK506-binding protein 12 ( P62942 ) , interacted with P25490 . These interactions are specific and also occur in mammalian cells . DB00091 and FK506 efficiently disrupt the P25490 -CyPA and P25490 - P62942 interactions . Overexpression of human CyPA and P62942 have different effects on P25490 -regulated transcription with these effects being promoter-dependent . These results suggest that immunophilins may be mediators in the functional role of P25490 .
