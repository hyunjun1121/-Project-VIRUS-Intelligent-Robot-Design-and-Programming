P42345 inhibitor RAD001 ( DB01590 ) enhances the effects of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia by raising the nuclear expression of c- P00519 protein . Constitutive tyrosine kinase ( TK ) activity of Q92817 P11274 - P00519 fusion protein of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) usurps physiological functions of normal p145 c- P00519 protein . Accordingly , its inhibition by imatinib mesylate ( IM ) lets p145 c- P00519 translocate into the nuclear compartment , which drives cell growth arrest and apoptotic death . Here we show that IM and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitor RAD001 ( DB01590 ) have additive effects on P11274 - P00519 -expressing cells . Those effects are at least partly conditional upon the enhanced nuclear accumulation of p145 c- P00519 through events encompassing post-translational modifications of p145 c- P00519 ( DB00156 (735) phosphorylation ) precluding its nuclear export and of 14-3-3 sigma ( DB00133 (186) phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase [ JNK ] ) promoting p145 c- P00519 nuclear re-import .
