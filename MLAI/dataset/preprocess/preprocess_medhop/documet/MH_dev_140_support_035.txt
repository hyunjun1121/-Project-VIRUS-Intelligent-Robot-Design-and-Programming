Gastrointestinal stromal tumors : a review of case reports , diagnosis , treatment , and future directions . Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) is a nonepithelial , mesenchymal tumor first described by Mazur and Clark in 1983 . Since then , its molecular biology has been studied in great detail . Special interest in the role of tyrosine kinase in its regulation has been the target by different drug research . Mutation in c-kit exons 9 , 11 , 13 , 17 and P16234 mutation in exons 12 , 14 , 18 are responsible for activation of gene signaling system resulting in uncontrolled phosphorylation and tissue growth . However , 5 to 15 % of GISTs does not harbor these mutations , which raises additional questions in another alternate signaling pathway mutation yet to be discovered . Diagnosis of GISTs relies heavily on P10721 /CD117 immunohistochemical staining , which can detect most GISTs except for a few 3 % to 5 % that harbors P16234 mutation . Newer staining against PKC theta and DOG-1 genes showed promising results but are not readily available . Clinical manifestation of GISTs is broad and highly dependent on tumor size . Surgery still remains the first-line treatment for GISTs . The advancement of molecular biology has revolutionized the availability of newer drugs , Imatinib and DB01268 . Together with its advancement is the occurrence of Imatinib/ DB01268 drug resistance . With this , newer monoclonal antibody drugs are being developed and are undergoing clinical trials to hopefully improve survival in patients with GISTs .
