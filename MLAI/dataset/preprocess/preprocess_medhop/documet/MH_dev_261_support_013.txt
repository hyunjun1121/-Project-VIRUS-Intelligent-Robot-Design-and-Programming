DB00169 down-regulates monocyte TLR expression and triggers hyporesponsiveness to pathogen-associated molecular patterns . Toll-like receptors ( TLR ) represent an ancient front-line defence system that enables the host organism to sense the presence of microbial components within minutes . As inducers of inflammation , TLR act as important triggers of distinct entities such as sepsis or autoimmune disease exacerbation . We report here that vitamin D3 [ 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol , 1,25(OH)(2)D3 ] suppresses the expression of O60603 and O00206 protein and mRNA in human monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent fashion . Despite 1,25(OH)(2)D3-induced up-regulation of P08571 , challenge of human monocytes with either LPS or lipoteichoic acid resulted in impaired P01375 and procoagulatory tissue factor ( CD142 ) production , emphasizing the critical role of TLR in the induction of inflammation . Moreover , reduced TLR levels in 1,25(OH)(2)D3-treated phagocytes were accompanied by impaired NF-kappaB/RelA translocation to the nucleus and by reduced p38 and Q8NFH3 /44 ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ) phosphorylation upon TLR-ligand engagement . Both TLR down-regulation and P08571 up-regulation were substantially inhibited by the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) antagonist ZK 159222 , indicating that the immunomodulatory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D3 on innate immunity receptors requires P11473 transcription factor activation . Our data provide strong evidence that 1,25(OH)(2)D3 primes monocytes to respond less effectively to bacterial cell wall components in a P11473 -dependent mechanism , most likely due to decreased levels of O60603 and O00206 .
