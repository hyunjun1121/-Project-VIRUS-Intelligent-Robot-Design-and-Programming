DeltaEF1 mediates TGF-beta signaling in vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation . Alteration in the differentiated state of smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) is known to be integral to vascular development and the pathogenesis of vascular disease . However , it is still largely unknown how environmental cues translate into transcriptional control of SMC genes . We found that deltaEF1 is upregulated during SMC differentiation and selectively transactivates the promoters of SMC differentiation marker genes , SM alpha-actin and SM myosin heavy chain ( SM-MHC ) . DeltaEF1 physically interacts with P11831 and P84022 , resulting in a synergistic activation of SM alpha-actin promoter . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and knockdown experiments showed that deltaEF1 is involved in the control of the SMC differentiation programs induced by TGF-beta signaling . Overexpression of deltaEF1 inhibited neointima formation and promoted SMC differentiation , whereas heterozygous deltaEF1 knockout mice exhibited exaggerated neointima formation . It thus appears deltaEF1 mediates SMC differentiation via interaction with P11831 and P84022 during development and in vascular disease .
