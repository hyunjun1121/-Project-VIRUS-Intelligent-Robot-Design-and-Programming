Anti-stress effect of astragaloside IV in immobilized mice . ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE : Astragaloside IV , a major component extracted from the roots of Astragalus membranaceus ( AM ) , possesses anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative , anti-fibrotic , anti-infarction and immunoregulatory effects . To clarify anti-stress effect of AM , anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects of 80 % ethanol extract of AM and astragaloside IV were investigated in immobilization stress model . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The mice were orally administered with AM ( 50 , 200 , and 500 mg/kg ) , astragaloside IV ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mg/kg ) and buspirone , a positive drug , 1h before immobilization treated for 2h . For anxiolytic activity assay , EPM test was performed in mice . For anti-inflammatory activity assay , serum levels of corticosterone , P05231 and P01375 -α were measured using ELISA kits . RESULTS : AM extract and astragaloside IV increased dose-dependently time spent on open arms and open arm entries in the EPM test . Anxiolytic effects of AM extract ( 500 mg/kg ) and astragaloside IV ( 20 mg/kg ) were comparable to those of buspirone ( 1 mg/kg ) . Their anxiolytic effects were blocked by WAY-100635 ( 0.5 mg/kg , i.p. ) , a P08908 receptor antagonist ( p < 0.01 ) , but not by flumazenil ( 3 mg/kg , i.p. ) and bicuculline ( 0.5 mg/kg , i.p. ) , GABAA receptor antagonists . AM extract and astragaloside IV also reduced serum levels of corticosterone , P05231 and P01375 -α dose-dependently . CONCLUSIONS : AM , particularly astragaloside IV , may ameliorate immobilized stress-induced anxiety and inflammation .
