FcεRI stimulation promotes the differentiation of histamine receptor 1-expressing inflammatory macrophages . BACKGROUND : Monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells or macrophages and recruitment to peripheral organs in chronic inflammatory diseases are directed by allergen challenge via FcεRI as well as the nature of soluble factors in the microenvironment . High-affinity receptor for IgE stimulation of effector cells results in the release of histamine , which acts on various histamine receptors ( HR ) 1-4 , expressed by immune cells . METHODS : We examined the effect of FcεRI stimulation of human monocytes on P35367 expression and function of differentiating cells . The mRNA levels of P35367 , P25021 and histidine decarboxylase of differentiating cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR . Expression of CD1c , CD11c , P34810 and Q86VB7 was detected by flow cytometry . Amount of histamine , P05231 and IL-12p70 in the cell culture was measured with the help of cytometric bead arrays or ELISA assays . Numbers of P35367 -expressing macrophages were evaluated by immunofluorescence double staining of P34810 and P35367 on human skin sections . RESULTS : We demonstrated that FcεRI stimulation promotes the generation of P35367 -expressing macrophage-like cells with enhanced histamine biosynthesis and P35367 -mediated proinflammatory properties . Supporting our in vitro findings , high numbers of P35367 -expressing P34810 (pos) macrophages were detected in the dermis of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) skin lesions . CONCLUSION : Our observations point to a close histamine-/HR-mediated activation of dermal macrophages , leading to modified cell differentiation and responsiveness via P35367 , which might contribute to the aggravation of allergic skin inflammation in AD .
