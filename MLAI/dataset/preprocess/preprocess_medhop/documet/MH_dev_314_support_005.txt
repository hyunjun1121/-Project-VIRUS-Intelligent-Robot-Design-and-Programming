Tandutinib , an oral , small-molecule inhibitor of P36888 for the treatment of AML and other cancer indications . An improved understanding of acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) over the past two decades has led to a characterization of associated recurring cytogenetic abnormalities . AML is often driven by the overexpression or constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as P36888 ( P36888 ) , which serves as a good therapeutic target . Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc 's DB05465 ( DB05465 ) is an orally active inhibitor of P36888 kinase and family members P09619 beta and c-Kit . Tandutinib inhibited P36888 phosphorylation , downstream signaling and malignant growth in vitro and in animal models . The drug exhibited limited activity as a single agent in phase I and II clinical trials in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome , but displayed promising antileukemic activity ( 90 % complete remissions ) in a phase I/II trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML when administered in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin . Phase II clinical trials for DB05465 are ongoing in patients with AML or renal cell carcinoma .
