Functional autoradiography of neuropeptide Y Q03519 and P49146 subtypes in rat brain using agonist stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding . Neuropeptide Y , one of the most abundant brain peptides , has been found to modulate several important biological functions via a family of G-protein coupled receptors . To investigate the localization of functional P01303 receptor subtypes in the rat brain , we performed agonist-induced [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography . The Q03519 /Y4/Y5 agonist DB00149 (31) , Pro(34)- P01303 increased [35S]GTPgammaS binding in several brain areas with a regional distribution consistent with that produced when labeling adjacent sections with [ 125I ] - DB00149 (31) , Pro(34)- P10082 . The Q03519 selective antagonist BIBP3226 antagonized the DB00149 (31) , Pro(34)- P01303 stimulated increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding in all areas examined . The P28062 agonist P06681 - P01303 stimulated [35S]GTPgamma binding in numerous brain areas with a regional distribution similar to the binding observed with [ 125I ] - DB05004 . No increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding above basal was observed in any brain area evaluated using Y4 and Y5 selective agonists . This study demonstrates abundant Q03519 and P49146 activation in the rat brain , while evidence for functional Y4 and Y5 receptors was not observed .
