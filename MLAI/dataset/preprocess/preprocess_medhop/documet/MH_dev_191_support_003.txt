[ Enhancement of hypoxia tolerance and survival rate of Daphnia in severe hypoxia based on acidic preconditioning ] . pH homeostasis is essential for development , proliferation and apoptosis of cells . Once the pH balances are broken , cell functions and survival will be affected . Nevertheless , moderate acidosis could result in adaptive responses for cell survival and increase tolerance to harmful stress . Here we found that acidic preconditioning ( P25054 ) could significantly increase the survival rate of Daphnia pulex , a freshwater invertebrate , during severe hypoxic insult . Meanwhile , the acidic treatment significantly increased the gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) . Both echinomycin , an inhibitor of HIF , and compound C , an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , could effectively eliminate the acid-induced hypoxic tolerance and the enhanced transcription of HIF . DB06287 , an inhibitor of mammalian Target of DB00877 ( P42345 ) , though effectively abolished the increased transcription of HIF , improved the P25054 -mediated protection . This result suggests that the involvement of the HIF and AMPK and P42345 could signal the pathways in P25054 -induced protection against hypoxic insult .
