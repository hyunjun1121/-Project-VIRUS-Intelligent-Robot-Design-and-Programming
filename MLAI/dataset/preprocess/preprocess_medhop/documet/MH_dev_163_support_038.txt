Maxi-anion channel as a candidate pathway for osmosensitive DB00171 release from mouse astrocytes in primary culture . In the present study , we aimed to evaluate the pathways contributing to DB00171 release from mouse astrocytes during hypoosmotic stress . We first examined the expression of mRNAs for proteins constituting possible DB00171 -releasing pathways that have been suggested over the past several years . In RT-PCR analysis using both control and osmotically swollen astrocytes , amplification of cDNA fragments of expected size was seen for connexins ( P08034 , P35212 , P17302 ) , pannexin 1 ( Px1 ) , the Q99572 receptor , MRP1 and P08183 , but not P13569 . Inhibitors of exocytotic vesicular release , gap junction hemi-channels , P13569 , MRP1 , P08183 , the Q99572 receptor , and volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying chloride channels had no significant effects on the massive DB00171 release from astrocytes . In contrast , the hypotonicity-induced DB00171 release from astrocytes was most effectively inhibited by gadolinium ( 50 muM ) , an inhibitor of the maxi-anion channel , which has recently been shown to serve as a pathway for DB00171 release from several other cell types . Thus , we propose that the maxi-anion channel constitutes a major pathway for swelling-induced DB00171 release from cultured mouse astrocytes as well .
