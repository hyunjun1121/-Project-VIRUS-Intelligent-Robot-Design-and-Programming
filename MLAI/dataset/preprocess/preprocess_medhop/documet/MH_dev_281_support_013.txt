Glucocorticoid-induced S-adenosylmethionine enhances the interferon signaling pathway by restoring P42224 protein methylation in hepatitis B virus-infected cells . Patients with chronic hepatitis B usually exhibit a low response to treatment with interferon α ( IFN-α ) . An alternative approach to increase the response rate of IFN-α might be to immunologically stimulate the host with glucocorticoids ( GCs ) before treatment with IFN-α , but the underlying mechanism remains unclear . We hypothesized that the GCs enhance IFN signaling by inducing S-adenosylmethionine ( DB00118 ) when hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) replication was effectively suppressed by IFN-α . Here , we investigated the effect of GCs and IFN-α on DB00118 production and methionine adenosyltransferase 1A ( Q00266 ) expression in vitro . Furthermore , we determined whether post-transcriptional regulation is involved in HBV-repressed Q00266 expression and DB00118 production induced by dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) . We found that DB00118 homeostasis was disrupted by DB00514 and that DB00514 directly regulated Q00266 expression by enhancing the binding of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) to the glucocorticoid-response element ( GRE ) of the Q00266 promoter . HBV reduced DB00118 production by increasing methylation at GRE sites within the Q00266 promoter . The X protein of hepatitis B virus led to hypermethylation in the Q00266 promoter by recruiting DNA methyltransferase 1 , and it inhibited GR binding to the GRE in the Q00266 promoter . DB00514 could increase an antiviral effect by inducing DB00118 production via a positive feedback loop when HBV is effectively suppressed by IFN-α , and the mechanism that involves DB00514 -induced DB00118 could increase P42224 methylation rather than P42224 phosphorylation . These findings provide a possible mechanism by which GC-induced DB00118 enhances the antiviral activity of IFN-α by restoring P42224 methylation in HBV-infected cells .
