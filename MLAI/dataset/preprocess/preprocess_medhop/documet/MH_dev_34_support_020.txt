Possible role of cholecystokinin-A receptors in regulation of thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) secretion in male rats . We studied the importance of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) system in the regulation of thyrotropin ( DB00024 ) and prolactin ( PRL ) secretion in male rats . To this end , we tested the effects of both unselective CCK agonists CCK-8 and caerulein , and CCK-B selective agonists Q13308 and pentagastrin as well as the selective CCK antagonists ( devazepide and L-365,260 ) at wide dose-ranges on the cold-stimulated and TRH-induced DB00024 and PRL secretion . DB00403 , given s.c . 15 min before sacrifice , decreased DB00024 levels at 5 micrograms/kg . In time course-studies , the maximum inhibition was seen at 15 min but the effect lasted at least 30 , but less than 60 min . Also CCK-8 decreased DB00024 levels at the doses of 20 and 50 micrograms/kg at 15 min . Devazepide and L-365,260 did not affect DB00024 or PRL levels at any dose . The effect of caerulein ( 5 micrograms/kg ) was antagonized by devazepide , a CCK-A antagonist , at 100 micrograms/kg , but not by a CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 tested at a wide dose range . PRL levels were not affected by any treatment . DB00403 ( 5 micrograms/kg ) , given at the same time as TRH ( 500 ng/kg ) , inhibited the TRH-induced DB00024 levels at 15 min , but not at 30 or 60 min . CCK-8 ( 50 micrograms/kg ) , Q13308 ( 100 micrograms/kg ) and pentagastrin ( 500 micrograms/kg ) did not affect the TRH-induced DB00024 secretion . The results probably indicate that P32238 stimulation inhibits DB00024 secretion at the level of the anterior pituitary gland . PRL levels in male rats are not affected by CCK system .
