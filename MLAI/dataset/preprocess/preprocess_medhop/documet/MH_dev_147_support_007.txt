Solution structure of APETx1 from the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima : a new fold for an Q12809 toxin . APETx1 is a 42-amino acid toxin purified from the venom of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima . This cysteine-rich peptide possesses three disulfide bridges ( C4-C37 , P13671 -C30 , and C20-C38 ) . Its pharmacological target is the Ether-a-gogo potassium channel . We herein determine the solution structure of APETx1 by use of conventional two-dimensional 1H-NMR techniques followed by torsion angle dynamics and refinement protocols . The calculated structure of APETx1 belongs to the disulfide-rich all-beta structural family , in which a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet is the only secondary structure . APETx1 is the first Ether-a-gogo effector discovered to fold in this way . We therefore compare the structure of APETx1 to those of the two other known effectors of the Ether-a-gogo potassium channel , CnErg1 and BeKm-1 , and analyze the topological disposition of key functional residues proposed by analysis of the electrostatic anisotropy . The interacting surface is made of a patch of aromatic residues ( Y5 , Y32 , and F33 ) together with two basic residues ( K8 and P05783 ) at the periphery of the surface . We pinpoint the absence of the central lysine present in the functional surface of the two other Ether-a-gogo effectors .
