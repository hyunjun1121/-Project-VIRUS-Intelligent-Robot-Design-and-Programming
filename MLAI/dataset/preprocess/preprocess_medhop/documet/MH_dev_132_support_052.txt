Ds-echinoside A , a new triterpene glycoside derived from sea cucumber , exhibits antimetastatic activity via the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent P14780 and P15692 expressions . Ds-echinoside A ( DSEA ) , a non-sulfated triterpene glycoside , was isolated from the sea cucumber Pearsonothuria graeffei . In vitro and in vivo investigations were conducted on the effects of DSEA on tumor cell adhesion , migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . In this study , we found that DSEA inhibited the proliferation of human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells Hep G2 , with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC₅₀ ) of 2.65 μmol/L , and suppressed Hep G2 cell adhesion , migration , and invasion in a dose-dependent manner . DSEA also reduced tube formation of human endothelial cells ECV-304 on matrigel in vitro and attenuated neovascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) assay in vivo . Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that DSEA significantly decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) , which plays an important role in the degradation of basement membrane in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis . DSEA also increased the protein expression level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ( P01033 ) , an important regulator of P14780 activation . From the results of Western blotting , the expressions of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) were found to be remarkably reduced by DSEA . These findings suggest that DSEA exhibits a significant anti-metastatic activity through the specific inhibition of NF-κB-dependent P14780 and P15692 expressions .
