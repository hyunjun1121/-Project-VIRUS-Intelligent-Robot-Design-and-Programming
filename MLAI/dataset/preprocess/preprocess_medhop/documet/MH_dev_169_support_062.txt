Analysis of P08514 /IIIa receptor number by quantification of 7E3 binding to human platelets . A large number of glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptors are present on the surface of platelets . Studies to define precisely the number of P08514 /IIIa receptors using specific monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) or fibrinogen binding have , however , yielded varying estimates of receptor number . To refine the quantitative estimation of P08514 /IIIa receptors on resting platelets , we have used the MoAb DB00054 , which has high affinity for P08514 /IIIa . Quantitative binding studies were performed using radiolabeled conjugates of 7E3 IgG , as well as fragments and derivatives of DB00054 . For platelets obtained from any single individual , the numbers of 7E3 F(ab')2 and IgG molecules bound per platelet were equivalent ( approximately 40,000 ) , whereas the number of Fab molecules bound per platelet was consistently approximately twofold higher ( approximately 80,000 ) . To investigate the basis of the quantitative disparity in binding of intact 7E3 and 7E3 F(ab')2 versus 7E3 Fab , we studied the binding of a newly constructed , bispecific (Fab')2 molecule containing only a single 7E3 combining site . Because this construct bound to the same extent as the Fab species , the larger size of the intact 7E3 and 7E3 F(ab')2 molecules could not explain the reduced number of molecules that bound per platelet compared to the Fab fragment . Rather , it appears that the valency of the antibody is the critical factor determining the number of antibody molecules bound per platelet . Thus , we conclude that the binding of 7E3 Fab corresponds most closely with surface P08514 /IIIa number and that the number of P08514 /IIIa receptors is approximately 80,000 per platelet .
