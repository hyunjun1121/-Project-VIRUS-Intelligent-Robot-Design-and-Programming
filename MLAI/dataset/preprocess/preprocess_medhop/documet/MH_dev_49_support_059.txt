Complementation by P10415 and C-HA- DB01367 oncogenes in malignant transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts . The P10415 ( B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 ) and C-HA- DB01367 oncogenes encode membrane-associated proteins of 26 and 21 kilodaltons , respectively . Although DB01367 proteins have long been known for their ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP , recent investigations suggest that P10415 encodes a novel GTP-binding protein ( S. Haldar , C. Beatty , Y. Tsujimoto , and C. M. Croce , Nature [ London ] 342:195-198 , 1989 ) . Cotransfection of P10415 and HA- DB01367 oncogenes resulted in morphological transformation of early-passage rodent fibroblasts , rendering these cells tumorigenic in animals and enabling them to grow in semisolid medium . In contrast , cotransfection of P10415 with oncogenes that encode nuclear proteins ( E1A and C-MYC ) did not produce malignant transformation , whereas HA- DB01367 did complement with these genes . These findings suggest that proteins encoded by oncogenes such as P10415 and HA- DB01367 , although having similar subcellular locations and perhaps similar biochemical properties , can regulate distinct complementary pathways involved in cellular transformation .
