Release of mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the course of a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction caused by anti-D . BACKGROUND : In vitro studies suggest that mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome are generated in the course of hemolytic transfusion reactions . Evidence for the in vivo significance of these findings is given by the present clinical and laboratory analysis of a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction ( P10275 ) . CASE REPORT : A 67-year-old patient ( blood group O , D-negative ) with a negative pretransfusion antibody screen received a massive transfusion because of arterial bleeding ( Day 1 ) . The transfusion of group O , D-positive red cell concentrates was unavoidable because of limited supplies . At Day 10 , the patient developed a P10275 with symptoms of septic-toxic syndrome and signs of hemolysis ; he received an exchange transfusion . Serologic markers , as well as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators , were monitored at the onset of the P10275 and during the exchange transfusion . RESULTS : At Day 10 , the direct antiglobulin test was positive ; anti-D was present , most likely as the result of an anamnestic immune response . Interleukin ( IL ) -1 was not detectable ; all other mediators monitored were elevated : IL-1 receptor antagonist , tumor necrosis factor , P05231 , P10145 , P22301 , neopterin , elastase , C3a-desArg , P02741 , and fibrinogen . Most of the values declined during the exchange transfusion , which was followed by an improvement of the clinical presentation . CONCLUSIONS : Mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome were released in the course of a P10275 caused by anti-D . Severe clinical symptoms could be treated successfully by exchange transfusion .
