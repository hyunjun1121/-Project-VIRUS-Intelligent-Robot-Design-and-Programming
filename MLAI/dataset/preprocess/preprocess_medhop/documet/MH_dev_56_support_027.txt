The treatment of established murine collagen-induced arthritis with a P19438 -selective antagonistic mutant P01375 . Blocking the binding of P01375 to P01375 receptor subtype-1 ( P19438 ) is an important strategy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . We recently succeeded in developing a P19438 -selective antagonistic P01375 mutant , R1antTNF . Here , we report the anti-inflammatory effects of R1antTNF in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model . To improve the in vivo stability of R1antTNF , we first engineered PEG ( polyethylene glycol ) -modified R1antTNF ( PEG-R1antTNF ) . In prophylactic protocols , PEG-R1antTNF clearly improved the incidence , and the clinical score of arthritis due to its long plasma half-life . Although , the effect of PEG-R1antTNF on the incidence and production of IL1-beta was less than that of the existing P01375 -blocking drug DB00005 , its effect on severity was almost as marked as DB00005 . Interestingly , in therapeutic protocols , PEG-R1antTNF showed greater therapeutic effect than DB00005 . These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of PEG-R1antTNF depend on the stage of arthritis . Recently , there has been much concern over the reactivation of viral infection caused by P01375 blockade . Unlike DB00005 , PEG-R1antTNF did not reactivate viral infection . Together , these results indicate that selective inhibition of P01375 / P19438 could be effective in treating RA and that PEG-R1antTNF could serve as a promising anti-inflammatory drug for this purpose .
