Comparison of rating scales used to evaluate DB01235 -induced dyskinesia in the 6-OHDA lesioned rat . Abnormal involuntary movement ( AIM ) rating scales are frequently used to study the mechanisms underlying DB01235 -induced dyskinesia ( LID ) in 6-OHDA lesioned rodents and the propensity of novel treatments for Parkinson 's disease to induce or alleviate similar abnormal behaviours . Despite the existence of at least one well validated method , other AIM scales are also in use . Moreover , there have been developments and variations in the original scales and their methods of use , without re-validation . In this study , 6-OHDA medial forebrain bundle lesioned Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with chronic DB01235 6 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks followed by 12 mg/kg/day for another 5 weeks . Rats were assessed weekly by simultaneous ratings on four published AIM and stereotypy scales with concurrent recording of rotation , over 3 hours following DB01235 injection . Three contemporary AIM scales have then been validated pharmacologically using agents that are known to reduce LID clinically and in primates ( amantadine ) or to interfere with the activity of DB01235 ( the D(1) and P14416 antagonists , P35240 -23390 and raclopride ) respectively . We also demonstrate that AIM , stereotypic and rotational behaviour are distinct motor dysfunctions induced by chronic and acute treatment of DB01235 , and should be assessed separately . The undertaking of assessments at multiple time points is essential especially when testing the efficacy of new potential anti-dyskinetic treatments . Importantly critical to all AIM and rotation testing is the internal validation of both the scale being used and the environment being used .
