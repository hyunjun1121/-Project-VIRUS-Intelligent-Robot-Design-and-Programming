Stimulatory effects of 5HT1A receptor agonists on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone release from cultured fetal rat hypothalamic cells : interactions with progesterone . Previous works have suggested an interactive stimulatory effect of progesterone ( P ) and serotonin ( 5-HT ) on luteinizing hormone release . The purpose of the present study was to determine whether 5-HT via P08908 receptors interacts with P in the process of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) release . Using fetal hypothalamic neurons in primary cell cultures the first goal of this study was to determine the effects of P08908 receptor agonists on P01148 secretion . 8-Hydroxy-2 ( di-n-propylamino ) tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) or ipsapirone ( 10(-5) M ) significantly stimulated P01148 release . Pharmacological studies have allowed to rule out the possible involvement of alpha 2- or beta-adrenoreceptors , or 5-HT uptake sites , in the stimulatory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on P01148 release , thus demonstrating the specific involvement of P08908 receptors in the stimulation of P01148 release . The second goal was to test the ability of P to stimulate P01148 release from fetal hypothalamic neurons . P ( 10(-6) M ) applied for 30 or 120 min significantly stimulated P01148 secretion . The maintenance of the stimulation of P01148 release by P after a cycloheximide treatment or by an impermeable analog of P , P-3-BSA , has suggested a nongenomic effect of P on P01148 release . The effects of a pretreatment of cells by P on 8-OH-DPAT-induced P01148 release were tested . While 10(-7) M P alone did not stimulate P01148 release , this concentration of steroid potentiated the P01148 response to 10(-5) M 8-OH-DPAT . These findings led to the conclusion that P acting at the level of the plasma membrane potentiates the stimulatory effect of P08908 receptor agonists on P01148 release .
