Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK 222584 inhibits both the induction and elicitation phases of contact hypersensitivity . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and its endothelial cell receptors ( VEGFR ) have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of the contact hypersensitivity ( Q99698 ) reaction . Previous studies have demonstrated that anti- P35968 antibody significantly suppresses the elicitation phase of Q99698 but does not affect the induction phase . PTK787/ZK 222584 ( 1-[4-chloroanilino]-4-[4-pyridylmethyl] phthalazine succinate ; DB04879 ) is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR tyrosine kinases . To test the effect of DB04879 on the induction and elicitation phases of Q99698 separately , we used an established method of Q99698 assay-sensitization and challenge in BALB/c mice . Either 50 mg/kg/day DB04879 or vehicle serving as a control was administered orally in the induction or elicitation phases separately . In the afferent phase , flow cytometry of skin-draining lymph node cells revealed that the migration of Langerhans cells was suppressed in the mice treated with DB04879 at sensitization . The degrees of ear swelling at 24 and 48 h were significantly diminished in mice treated with DB04879 at sensitization ( P < 0.05 ) . In the efferent phase , the degrees of ear swelling at 24 h ( P < 0.01 ) and 48 h ( P < 0.05 ) , ear blood flow at 24 and 48 h ( P < 0.01 ) , and production of P15692 in the epidermis at 24 h ( P < 0.05 ) were significantly suppressed in mice treated with DB04879 at elicitation . These findings and previous demonstrations suggest that both P15692 R-1 and P15692 R-2 are needed during the induction phase , and that P35968 has a pivotal role in the elicitation phase of the Q99698 reaction .
