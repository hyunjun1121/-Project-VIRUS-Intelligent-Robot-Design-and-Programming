P22681 mutation-related patterns of phosphorylation and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Recurrent homozygous P22681 -inactivating mutations in myeloid malignancies decrease ubiquitin ligase activity that inactivates P12931 family kinases ( SFK ) and receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) . However , the most important SFK and RTK affected by these mutations , and hence , the most important therapeutic targets , have not been clearly characterized . We compared SFK and RTK pathway activity and inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines containing homozygous R420Q mutation ( GDM-1 ) , heterozygous deletion ( MOLM13 ) and wild-type ( WT ) P22681 ( THP1 , U937 ) . As expected with P22681 loss , GDM-1 displayed high P10721 expression and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) hypersensitivity . Ectopic expression of WT P22681 decreased GDM-1 proliferation but not cell lines with WT P22681 . GDM-1 , but not the other cell lines , was highly sensitive to growth inhibition by dasatinib ( dual SFK and RTK inhibitor , LD50 50 nM ) ; there was less or no selective inhibition of GDM-1 growth by sunitinib ( RTK inhibitor ) , imatinib ( P00519 , P10721 inhibitor ) , or Q99463 ( SFK inhibitor ) . Phosphoprotein analysis identified phosphorylation targets uniquely inhibited by dasatinib treatment of GDM-1 , including a number of proteins in the P10721 and GM- P04141 receptor pathways ( for example , P10721 Tyr721 , P40763 Tyr705 ) . In conclusion , the promiscuous effects of P22681 loss on SFK and RTK signaling appear to be best targeted by dual SFK and RTK inhibition .
