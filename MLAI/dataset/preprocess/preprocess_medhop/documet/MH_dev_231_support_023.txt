Specific phosphorylation of SR proteins by mammalian P11387 . Several metazoan splicing factors are characterized by ribonucleoprotein ( Q96LT9 ) consensus sequences and arginine-serine repeats ( RS domain ) which are essential for their function in splicing . These include members of the SR-protein family ( SC35 , Q07955 /ASF ) , the U1 small nuclear ( sn ) Q96LT9 protein ( P08621 ) and the U2 snRNP auxiliary factor ( U2AF ) . SR proteins are phosphorylated in vivo and the phosphorylation state of P08621 's RS domain influences its splicing activity . Here we report the purification of a protein kinase that is specific for SR proteins and show that it is P11387 . This enzyme lacks a canonical DB00171 -binding motif but binds DB00171 with a dissociation constant of 50 nM . DB04690 and derivatives , known to be specific inhibitors of P11387 , strongly inhibit the kinase activity in the presence of DNA and affect the phosphorylation state of SR proteins . Thus , P11387 may well be one of the SR protein kinases operating in vivo .
