Key residues at the riboflavin kinase catalytic site of the bifunctional riboflavin kinase/ Q8NFF5 from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes . Many known prokaryotic organisms depend on a single bifunctional enzyme , encoded by the RibC of RibF gene and named DB03147 synthetase ( FADS ) , to convert DB00140 ( RF ) , first into Q68DA7 and then into DB03147 . The reaction occurs through the sequential action of two activities present on a single polypeptide chain where the N-terminus is responsible for the DB00171 : Q8NFF5 ( FMNAT ) activity and the C-terminus for the DB00171 : riboflavin kinase ( Q969G6 ) activity . Sequence and structural analysis suggest that T208 , N210 and E268 at the C-terminus Q969G6 module of Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FADS ( CaFADS ) might be key during RF phosphorylation . The effect of site-directed mutagenesis on the Q969G6 activity , as well as on substrates and products binding , indicates that T208 and N210 provide the Q969G6 active-site geometry for binding and catalysis , while E268 might be involved in the catalytic step as catalytic base . These data additionally suggest concerted conformational changes at the Q969G6 module of CaFADS during its activity . Mutations at the Q969G6 site also modulate the binding parameters at the FMNAT active site of CaFADS , altering the catalytic efficiency in the transformation of Q68DA7 into DB03147 . This observation supports the hypothesis that the hexameric assembly previously revealed by the crystal structure of CaFADS might play a functional role during catalysis .
