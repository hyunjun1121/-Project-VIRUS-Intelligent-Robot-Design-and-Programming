Quantitative immuno-positron emission tomography imaging of P04626 -positive tumor xenografts with an iodine-124 labeled anti- P04626 diabody . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) provides an effective means of both diagnosing/staging several types of cancer and evaluating efficacy of treatment . To date , the only U.S . Food and Drug Administration-approved radiotracer for oncologic PET is (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose , which measures glucose accumulation as a surrogate for malignant activity . Engineered antibody fragments have been developed with the appropriate targeting specificity and systemic elimination properties predicted to allow for effective imaging of cancer based on expression of tumor associated antigens . We evaluated a small engineered antibody fragment specific for the P04626 receptor tyrosine kinase ( P13671 .5 diabody ) for its ability to function as a PET radiotracer when labeled with iodine-124 . Our studies revealed P04626 -dependent imaging of mouse tumor xenografts with a time-dependent increase in tumor-to-background signal over the course of the experiments . Radioiodination via an indirect method attenuated uptake of radioiodine in tissues that express the Na/I symporter without affecting the ability to image the tumor xenografts . In addition , we validated a method for using a clinical PET/computed tomography scanner to quantify tumor uptake in small-animal model systems ; quantitation of the tumor targeting by PET correlated with traditional necropsy-based analysis at all time points analyzed . Thus , diabodies may represent an effective molecular structure for development of novel PET radiotracers .
