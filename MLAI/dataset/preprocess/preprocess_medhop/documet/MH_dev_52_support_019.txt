Design , synthesis , and biological evaluation of conformationally constrained aci-reductone mimics of arachidonic acid . An efficient and convergent synthesis has been developed for the production of 3,4-dihydroxy-5- [ 4- ( 2- ( ( 2Z ) -hexenyl ) phenyl ) -3-(1Z)-but enyl ] -2 ( 5H ) -furanone ( 12d ) . This hydrophobic antioxidant is a stable conformationally constrained mimic of arachidonic acid ( AA ) ( 1 ) and its respective aci-reductone analogue ( 2 ) . Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling of 5-(3-butynyl)-3,4-dihydroxy-2(5H)-furanone ( 7 ) with 2- ( ( 2Z ) -hexenyl ) iodobenzene ( 8d ) followed by Lindlar catalyzed hydrogenation produces 12d . Butynyl intermediate 7 is prepared from 2-(benzyloxy)-5-deoxyascorbic acid ( 15 ) by iodination ( I2 , PPh3 , Imd ) , iodo substitution with lithium acetylide ethylenediamine complex ( LiAEDA , HMPA , -5 degrees C ) , and benzyl group cleavage ( Ac2O , Pyr , BCl3 ) . The utility of this synthetic method was demonstrated by the synthesis of analogues 10e-k . Biological testing revealed that certain of these antioxidants inhibit both cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and P09917 ( P09917 ) with comparable efficacy as reported for aspirin and zileuton , respectively . The antioxidant activity of these aci-reductones , measured as a function of their inhibitory effect on CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation of hepatic microsomes , exceeds that produced by DB00163 . Synthetic routes and initial structure-activity relationships ( SAR ) for these novel mixed functioning antioxidants are presented .
