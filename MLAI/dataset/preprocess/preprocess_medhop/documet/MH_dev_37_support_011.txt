Post-synaptic P08908 receptor involvement in yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , physostigmine and mCPP in rats . DB00714 and mCPP induced yawning associated with penile erections in rats , whereas physostigmine induced only yawns . DB00714 -induced yawning and penile erections were antagonized by low doses of raclopride , whereas physostigmine-induced yawning and mCPP-induced effects were only partly inhibited at high doses of raclopride . DB00747 as well as clozapine antagonized yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , mCPP and physostigmine . Similarly , the P08908 agonists 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 inhibited yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine , mCPP and physostigmine , and at similar doses induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling . The beta/ P08908 antagonist tertatolol reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections and increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency but not penile erection frequency . Like tertatolol , propranolol increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency , whereas ICI 118551 increased only physostigmine-induced yawning . 8-OH-DPAT- and S 14506-induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling were also significantly antagonized by tertatolol . Finally , p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment produced about 95 % depletion in 5-HT in hypothalamus , hippocampus , striatum and frontal cortex and modified neither the responses of the inducing drugs nor the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections.
