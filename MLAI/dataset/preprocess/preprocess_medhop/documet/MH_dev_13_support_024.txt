[ Localization of pancreatic insulinomas by combined radiographic methods ] . Seventeen cases with a total of eighteen insulinomas were examined by ultrasonography ( US ) , computed tomography ( CT ) , angiography , percutaneous transhepatic portal and pancreatic venous sampling ( Q03393 ) and intraoperative ultrasonography ( IOUS ) . We discussed about diagnostic accuracy of insulinomas on these diagnostic modalities . Tumor localization was achieved by US in 39 % , CT in 72 % and angiography in 81 % . Although total 15 tumors ( 83 % ) can be correctly detected , multiple lesions were not completely ruled out . We recommended the criteria in Q03393 as follows : P01308 concentration level above 200 mu U/ml . Or , both of insulin concentration ratio ( step-up site/control ) above three and elevation of the P16435 concentration level on the Q03393 . According to these criteria , the accuracy rate was 91 % . Overall preoperative diagnostic accuracy was 100 % . IOUS allowed us to detect the localization of the tumors completely .
