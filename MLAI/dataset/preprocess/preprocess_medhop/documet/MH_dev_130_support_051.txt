DB00065 therapy efficacy and persistence at a Canadian academic centre despite a change in access procedure . Patients treated with infliximab at our centre through a special access programme ( initiation group ) had long-standing , treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis . The clinical experience for these patients may be different than that of patients initiating treatment after provincial government approval and cost coverage for all anti-tumour necrosis factor ( anti- P01375 ) therapies became effective ( contemporary group ) . We compared adverse events , drug survival and reasons for discontinuation in these two groups . A prospective cohort of patients treated with an anti- P01375 therapy was assembled following the availability of infliximab in 2000 . By protocol , patients are assessed for treatment response , discontinuation or switching of biologic agents and occurrence of adverse events . We report on 231 patients treated with infliximab therapy ( 680 patient-years ) . Both groups had similar drug survival ( median 2.2 years ) and rates of serious adverse events including infusion reactions ( 6.8 per 100 patient-years ) and serious infections ( 3.4 per 100 patient-years ) . More patients in the initiation group discontinued infliximab for adverse events [ 39/139 ( 28 % ) vs. 15/92 ( 16 % ) , p = 0.04 ] and developed drug-induced lupus [ 8/139 ( 6 % ) vs. 0 % , p = 0.02 ] . Subsequent biologics were discontinued for the same reason as infliximab in only 12 % ( 15/123 ) of cases . Patients treated with infliximab through a special access programme have comparable drug survival compared to a contemporary group , despite experiencing more adverse events . Only a minority of patients discontinuing infliximab due to the lack of effect or adverse events experience the same fate with subsequent anti- P01375 agents .
