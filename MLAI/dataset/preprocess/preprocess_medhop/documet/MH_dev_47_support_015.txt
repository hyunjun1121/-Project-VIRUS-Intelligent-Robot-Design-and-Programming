Inhibition of related JAK/ P35610 pathways with molecular targeted drugs shows strong synergy with ruxolitinib in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm . This study aimed to assess the antitumour effects , molecular mechanisms of action , and potential synergy of ruxolitinib with sorafenib , KNK437 , dasatinib , and perifosine , in Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms ( Q9BQR3 ) . Cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of the different compounds were determined in the O60674 V617F-positive cell lines , HEL and Ba/ P13726 ( JAK2V617F P19235 ) , and in primary mononuclear and bone marrow P28906 -positive cells from 19 Q9BQR3 patients . DB08877 [ 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) (PV) = 15 nmol/l ] , as well as sorafenib ( IC50 PV=8μmol/l ) , KNK437 ( IC50 PV=100μmol/l ) , and perifosine ( IC50 PV=15μmol/l ) , were able to inhibit proliferation in cell line models and in primary cells from Q9BQR3 patients . Dasatinib , KNK437 , and sorafenib showed a strong synergistic effect in combination with ruxolitinib [ combination index ( CI ) (PV) < 0·3 ] . Western blot confirmed that ruxolitinib blocked P29323 , and consequently P42229 activation , sorafenib inhibited P29323 , O75791 and P42229 , dasatinib blocked P12931 and P42229 , and KNK437 decreased the stability of the O60674 protein , reducing its expression . Inhibiting O60674 -related proliferative pathways has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation in MPNs . Furthermore , the combination of ruxolitinib with inhibitors that target these pathways has a strong synergistic effect , which may be due to decreased activation of the common effector , P42229 .
