A 77-base pair LINE-like sequence elicits androgen-dependent mvdp/akr1-b7 expression in mouse vas deferens , but is dispensable for adrenal expression in rats . Mvdp/akr1-b7 ( mouse vas deferens protein/aldo-keto reductase 1- P33681 ) encodes an enzyme responsible for detoxification of a steroidogenesis byproduct . MVDP/AKR1- P33681 is expressed in both rat and mouse adrenal cortex under DB01285 control , whereas strong androgen-dependent accumulation in the vas deferens is mouse specific . Comparison of the regulatory regions of the two orthologs reveals a strong identity , disrupted by acquisition of a 77-bp LINE-derived sequence in the mouse promoter . Although DB01285 responsiveness is observed in both species , the absence of this 77-bp sequence in the rat is associated with changes in transcription initiation sites . Transfection studies demonstrate that the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and selective promoter factor 1-binding sites previously shown to be essential for DB02527 / DB01285 induction in the mouse are consequently dispensable in the rat . Our data support the idea that the most striking change generated by this acquisition is the strong , androgen-dependent , vas deferens expression observed in mouse . 1 ) In rat vas deferens , rakr1-b7 expression is barely detectable and is not androgen sensitive . 2 ) P10275 binds efficiently to an androgen response element within the 77-bp mouse-specific element . 3 ) Its insertion confers androgen sensitiveness to rakr1-b7 regulatory regions in an androgen response element-dependent manner in transient transfections . We propose that this acquired androgen-responsive region may be responsible for vas deferens androgen-regulated gene expression in vivo .
