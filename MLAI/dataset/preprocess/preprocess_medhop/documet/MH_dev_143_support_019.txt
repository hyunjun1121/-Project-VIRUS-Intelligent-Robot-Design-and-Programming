Action of neltenexine on anion secretion in human airway epithelia . Neltenexine has been applied to human lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) as a mucolytic agent . However , we have no information on the neltenexine action in bronchial epithelial cells . We studied the neltenexine action on the ion transport in human submucosal serous Calu-3 cells . Under a hyper-secreting condition caused by terbutaline ( a beta2-adrenergic agonist ) , neltenexine diminished anion secretion by inhibiting the Cl- and HCO3- uptake via Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter without blockade of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) channel , and also diminished anion secretion via stimulation of Cl-/HCO3- exchanger , which facilitates the extrusion of more P13569 -permeant anion , Cl- , with the uptake of less P13569 -permeant anion , HCO3- . Thus , neltenexine reduced the hyper-secretion to keep an appropriate fluid level in the airway , providing a possibility that neltenexine can be an effective drug in airway obstructive diseases by decreasing the airway resistance under a hyper-secreting condition .
