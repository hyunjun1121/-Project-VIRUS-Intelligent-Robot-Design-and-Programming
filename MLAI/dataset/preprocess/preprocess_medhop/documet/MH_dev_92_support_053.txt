Phospho-ΔNp63α/ P36956 protein interactions : bridging cell metabolism and cisplatin chemoresistance . Tumor protein ( TP ) -p53 family members ( Q9H3D4 , Q9H3D4 and O15350 ) are guardians of the genome and key players in orchestrating the cellular response to cisplatin treatment . DB00515 -induced phosphorylation of ΔNp63α was shown to have a role in regulating intracellular ΔNp63α protein levels . We previously found that squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cells exposed to cisplatin displayed the Q13315 -dependent phosphorylation of ΔNp63α ( p-ΔNp63α ) , which is critical for the transcriptional regulation of specific downstream mRNAs and microRNAs and is likely to underlie the chemoresistance of SCC cells . However , SCC cells expressing non-p-ΔNp63α became more cisplatin-resistant . We also found that p-ΔNp63α forms complexes with a number of proteins involved in cell death response through regulation of cell cycle arrest , apoptosis , autophagy , RNA splicing and chromatin modifications . Here , we showed that p-ΔNp63α induced P05089 , P04406 , and P23786 gene transcription in cisplatin-sensitive SCC cells , while non-p-ΔNp63α increased a transcription of CAD , P11413 and P49327 genes in cisplatin-resistant SCC cells . We report that the p-ΔNp63α-dependent regulatory mechanisms implicated in the modulation of plethora of pathways , including amino acid , carbohydrate , lipid and nucleotide metabolisms , thereby affect tumor cell response to cisplatin-induced cell death , suggesting that the Q13315 -dependent ΔNp63α pathway plays a role in the resistance of tumor cells to platinum therapy .
