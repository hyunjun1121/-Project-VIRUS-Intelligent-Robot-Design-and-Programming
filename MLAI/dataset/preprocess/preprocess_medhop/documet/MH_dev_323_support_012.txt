Specificity analysis of lectins and antibodies using remodeled glycoproteins . Due to their ability to bind specifically to certain carbohydrate sequences , lectins are a frequently used tool in cytology , histology , and glycan analysis but also offer new options for drug targeting and drug delivery systems . For these and other potential applications , it is necessary to be certain as to the carbohydrate structures interacting with the lectin . Therefore , we used glycoproteins remodeled with glycosyltransferases and glycosidases for testing specificities of lectins from Aleuria aurantia ( AAL ) , Erythrina cristagalli ( ECL ) , Griffonia simplicifolia ( GSL I-B(4) ) , Helix pomatia agglutinin ( Q9Y251 ) , Lens culinaris ( LCA ) , Lotus tetragonolobus ( P01374 ) , peanut ( Arachis hypogaeae ) ( PNA ) , Ricinus communis ( RCA I ) , Sambucus nigra ( SNA ) , Vicia villosa ( VVA ) , and wheat germ ( Triticum vulgaris ) ( WGA ) as well as reactivities of anti-carbohydrate antibodies ( anti-bee venom , anti-horseradish peroxidase [ anti-HRP ] , and anti-Lewis(x) ) . After enzymatic remodeling , the resulting neoglycoforms display defined carbohydrate sequences and can be used , when spotted on nitrocellulose or in enzyme-linked lectinosorbent assays , to identify the sugar moieties bound by the lectins . P02787 with its two biantennary complex N-glycans was used as scaffold for gaining diverse N-glycosidic structures , whereas fetuin was modified using glycosidases to test the specificities of lectins toward both N- and O-glycans . In addition , alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein and Schistosoma mansoni egg extract were chosen as controls for lectin interactions with fucosylated glycans ( Lewis(x) and core alpha1,3-fucose ) . Our data complement and expand the existing knowledge about the binding specificity of a range of commercially available lectins .
