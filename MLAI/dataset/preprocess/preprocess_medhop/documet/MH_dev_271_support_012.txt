In vivo effects of a combined P28222 receptor/ P31645 antagonist in experimental pulmonary hypertension . AIMS : A mechanism for co-operation between the serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) transporter and P28222 receptor in mediating pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells has been demonstrated in vitro . Here we determine , for the first time , the in vivo effects of a combined P28222 receptor/serotonin transporter antagonist ( LY393558 ) with respect to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) and its in vitro effects in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( hPASMCs ) derived from idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) patients . METHODS AND RESULTS : We determined the effects of LY393558 as well as a selective serotonin transporter inhibitor , citalopram , on right ventricular pressure , right ventricular hypertrophy , and pulmonary vascular remodelling in wildtype mice and mice over-expressing serotonin transporter ( P31645 + mice ) before and after hypoxic exposure . We also compared their effectiveness at reversing PAH in P31645 + mice and hypoxic mice . Further , we examined the proliferative response to serotonin in IPAH hPASMCs . We also clarified the pharmacology of serotonin-induced vasoconstriction and P28222 receptor/serotonin transporter interactions in mouse isolated pulmonary artery . DB00215 had a moderate effect at preventing and reversing experimental PAH in vivo whereas LY393558 was more effective . LY393558 was more effective than citalopram at reversing serotonin-induced proliferation in IPAH hPASMCs . There is synergy between P28222 receptor and serotonin transporter inhibitors against serotonin-induced vasoconstriction in mouse pulmonary arteries . CONCLUSION : P28222 receptor and serotonin transporter inhibition are effective at preventing and reversing experimental PAH and serotonin-induced proliferation of PASMCs derived from IPAH patients . Targeting both the serotonin transporter and P28222 receptor may be a novel therapeutic approach to PAH .
