Temporal network based analysis of cell specific vein graft transcriptome defines key pathways and hub genes in implantation injury . Vein graft failure occurs between 1 and 6 months after implantation due to obstructive intimal hyperplasia , related in part to implantation injury . The cell-specific and temporal response of the transcriptome to vein graft implantation injury was determined by transcriptional profiling of laser capture microdissected endothelial cells ( EC ) and medial smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) from canine vein grafts , 2 hours ( H ) to 30 days ( D ) following surgery . Our results demonstrate a robust genomic response beginning at 2 H , peaking at 12-24 H , declining by 7 D , and resolving by 30 D . Gene ontology and pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes indicated that implantation injury affects inflammatory and immune responses , apoptosis , mitosis , and extracellular matrix reorganization in both cell types . Through backpropagation an integrated network was built , starting with genes differentially expressed at 30 D , followed by adding upstream interactive genes from each prior time-point . This identified significant enrichment of P05231 , P10145 , NF-κB , dendritic cell maturation , glucocorticoid receptor , and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells ( Q9NP99 ) signaling , as well as PPARα activation pathways in graft EC and SMC . Interactive network-based analyses identified P05231 , P10145 , IL-1α , and P01308 Receptor ( P06213 ) as focus hub genes within these pathways . Real-time PCR was used for the validation of two of these genes : P05231 and P10145 , in addition to Collagen 11A1 ( P12107 ) , a cornerstone of the backpropagation . In conclusion , these results establish causality relationships clarifying the pathogenesis of vein graft implantation injury , and identifying novel targets for its prevention .
