Novel structural features of CDK inhibition revealed by an ab initio computational method combined with dynamic simulations . The rational development of specific inhibitors for the approximately 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome is impeded by a poor understanding of the structural basis for the activity and selectivity of small molecules that compete for DB00171 binding . Combining classical dynamic simulations with a novel ab initio computational approach linear-scalable to molecular interactions involving thousands of atoms , we have investigated the binding of five distinct inhibitors to the cyclin-dependent kinase P24941 . We report here that polarization and dynamic hydrogen bonding effects , so far undetected by crystallography , affect both their activity and selectivity . The effects arise from the specific solvation patterns of water molecules in the DB00171 binding pocket or the intermittent formation of hydrogen bonds during the dynamics of CDK/inhibitor interactions and explain the unexpectedly high potency of certain inhibitors such as 3-(3H-imidazol-4-ylmethylene)-5-methoxy-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one ( DB03428 ) . The Lys89 residue in the DB00171 -binding pocket of P24941 is observed to form temporary hydrogen bonds with the three most potent inhibitors . This residue is replaced in P11802 by Thr89 , whose shorter side-chain can not form similar bonds , explaining the relative selectivity of the inhibitors for P24941 . Our results provide a generally applicable computational method for the analysis of biomolecular structures and reveal hitherto unrecognized features of the interaction between protein kinases and their inhibitors .
