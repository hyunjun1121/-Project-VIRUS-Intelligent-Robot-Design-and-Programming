Contribution of P62937 to determination of simian immunodeficiency virus tropism : a progress update . An understanding of cellular factors that affect viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for the determination of viral tropism . P62937 ( CypA ) , a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) , is an essential host factor for the efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in human cells . However , its role in simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) replication has not been determined . In the 2008 US-Japan AIDS panel meeting , I have presented the effect of cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , a PPIase inhibitor , on replication of wild-type SIV . Interestingly , DB00091 treatment enhanced SIV replication in human cells but abrogated SIV replication in macaque cells , implying a species-specific effect of DB00091 on SIV replication . After this meeting , analysis using CypA knocked-down human cells indicated that CypA was considered inhibitory for SIV replication . These results suggest possible involvement of CypA in the determination of SIV tropism .
