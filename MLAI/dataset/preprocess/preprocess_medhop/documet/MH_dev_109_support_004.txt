The development of human megakaryocytes . II . P01730 expression occurs during haemopoietic differentiation and is an early step in megakaryocyte maturation . P01730 expression is not limited to T cells and monocytes . In both mouse and man the antigen has been detected on some early haemopoietic progenitors and we have shown that some mature megakaryocytes ( MK ) express P01730 , the surface molecule that serves as the high-affinity receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) . Using a serum-free culture system in which sorted P28906 + haemopoietic progenitors are cultured with thrombopoietin ( P07202 ) , P08700 , P05231 and P21583 , we now show that P01730 expression is induced in virtually all developing haemopoietic cells . This phenomenon was particularly striking in the MK lineage , where P01730 expression began whilst the cells were still P28906 + but after they expressed CD41 ( P08514 /IIIa ) . P01730 expression and endomitotic polyploidization occur at the same time in MK development . In culture , maximum P01730 expression occurred 4-6 d after CD41 expression and lasted for a few days . Expression of P01730 declined gradually thereafter and most MK were P01730 - by the end of the culture period . The amount of P01730 on the surface of some MK , as measured by intensity of fluorescence staining , exceeded that of normal monocytes and approached the brightness of T cells . Appearance of the surface antigen correlated with the presence of mRNA for P01730 , as measured by RT-PCR .
