[ Vascular Calcification - Pathological Mechanism and Clinical Application - . The effect of cinacalcet on vascular calcification ] . DB01012 acts on calcium receptors ( CaR ) expressed on chief cells of the parathyroid gland to inhibit the secretion of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . This drug inhibits PTH secretion without causing an elevation of serum calcium and phosphorus , unlike active vitamin D . Several experimental studies demonstrated an inhibitory effect of calcimimetics on the progression of vascular calcification in animals with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , in keeping with the expression of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) in vascular tissue . The EVOLVE , evaluated in patients with CKD 5D the effects of the cinacalcet on the progression of vascular calcification and hard cardiovascular outcomes , respectively . The EVOLVE trials missed their respective primary end point by intent-to-treat analysis . However , recently , in order to define the frequency of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events attributable to atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic mechanisms , risk factors for these events , and the effects of cinacalcet , post hoc analysis using adjudicated data collected during the EVOLVE Trial were perfomed . In this trial , combining fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events , randomization to cinacalcet reduced the rates of sudden death and heart failure . Patients randomized to cinacalcet experienced fewer nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular events , while the effect of cinacalcet on atherosclerotic events did not reach statistical significance .
