Human mitochondrial import receptor , Tom20p . Use of glutathione to reveal specific interactions between Tom20-glutathione S-transferase and mitochondrial precursor proteins . The cytosolic domain of the human mitochondrial protein import receptor , hTom20 , has been expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase ( Q86UG4 ) in bacteria and the purified protein immobilized on Sepharose beads . To discriminate between specific binding of precursor proteins with the receptor and non-specific binding , precursors were recovered as a complex with Q86UG4 -hTom20 following competitive elution from the beads with reduced glutathione . Here , we describe the specificity of this assay and demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of hTom20 interacts directly with the transcription-translation product of precursor proteins that bear a diverse array of targeting signals . Such proteins include a matrix protein ( pODHFR ) , a polytopic integral protein of the inner membrane ( uncoupling protein ) , a beta-barrel protein of the outer membrane ( P21796 /porin ) as well as bitopic integral proteins which are inserted into the outer membrane by either an NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal signal anchor sequence ( yTom70(1-29) P00374 and Bcl-2 , respectively ) .
