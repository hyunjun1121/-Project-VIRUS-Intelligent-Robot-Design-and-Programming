Serum concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus : the influence of acute hyperinsulinemia , very-low calorie diet and Q07869 -Î± agonist treatment . The aim of our study was to measure serum concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 19 ( O95750 ) in patients with obesity ( OB ) , obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and healthy subjects ( C ) at baseline and after selected interventions . We measured serum O95750 levels and other biochemical and hormonal parameters in 29 OB and 19 T2DM females and 30 sex- and age-matched control subjects . The interventions were acute hyperinsulinemia during isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp ( n=11 for T2DM and 10 for C ) , very-low calorie diet ( VLCD , n=12 for OB ) and 3 months treatment with Q07869 agonist fenofibrate ( n=11 for T2DM ) . Baseline serum O95750 levels were significantly lower in OB relative to C group ( 132.1+/-12.7 vs. 202.2+/-16.7 pg/ml , p < 0.05 ) , while no significant difference was observed between T2DM and OB or control group . Acute hyperinsulinemia tended to decrease O95750 levels in both healthy and T2DM subjects . Three weeks of VLCD in OB group had no significant effect on O95750 , whereas three months of fenofibrate treatment markedly reduced O95750 levels in T2DM patients ( 194.58+/-26.2 vs. 107.47+/-25.0 pg/ml , p < 0.05 ) . We conclude that O95750 levels in our study were at least partially dependent upon nutritional status , but were not related to parameters of glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity .
