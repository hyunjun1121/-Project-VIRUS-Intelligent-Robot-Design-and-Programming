A transcriptional block in the P60568 promoter at the -150 AP-1 site in effector CD8+ T cells . Both P01730 + and CD8+ T cells that produce P60568 in response to Ag recognition have been isolated . However , most effector CD8+ T cells recovered after exposure to Ag do not produce sufficient P60568 to sustain growth , and depend on P01730 + T helper cells for this obligate growth factor . P60568 expression in P01730 + T cells is primarily controlled at the level of transcription , but mechanisms restricting P60568 production in CD8+ T cells have not been elucidated . To evaluate transcriptional regulation of the P60568 gene in CD8+ T cells , we stably transfected reporter genes into Ag-specific CD8+ T cell clones . P10747 + CD8(+) T cells unable to transcribe the P60568 gene in response to antigenic stimulation had a block in transactivation of the -150 P10747 response element ( CD28RE ) /AP-1 site of the P60568 promoter , but did transactivate the composite NFAT/AP-1 and O75051 /AP-1 sites , and a consensus AP-1 motif . Mutation of the nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site to a consensus AP-1 site , or insertion of a CD28RE/AP-1 consensus site upstream of the native -150 CD28RE/AP-1 site restored transactivation of the altered promoter . These results suggest that the defect at the -150 site may reflect the absence or inactivity of a required factor rather than repression of the P60568 promoter .
