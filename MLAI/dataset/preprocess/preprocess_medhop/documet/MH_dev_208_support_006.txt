Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a bolus and infusion of cangrelor : a direct , parenteral Q9H244 receptor antagonist . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of cangrelor administered as an intravenous bolus plus a continuous infusion in healthy volunteers . Twenty-two healthy volunteers are randomized to receive 1 of 2 intravenous cangrelor dosing regimens : a 15-microg/kg bolus followed by a 2-microg/kg/min infusion or a 30-microg/kg bolus followed by a 4-microg/kg/min infusion . The infusion is continued for 60 minutes , and serial blood samples are obtained for evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters . Administration of an intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion rapidly achieves maximum concentrations of cangrelor that are associated with extensive platelet inhibition within 2 minutes . Moreover , extensive platelet inhibition is maintained throughout the infusion period with near-full recovery of platelet function within 60 to 90 minutes of terminating the infusion . The effect of high-dose cangrelor is more consistent and demonstrates a greater level of inhibition on adenosine diphosphate-induced P16109 expression ; how ever , no significant differences are observed between the 2 dosing regimens with regard to platelet aggregation or time to recovery of platelet function . DB06441 administered as an intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion in healthy volunteers offers rapid and reversible inhibition of platelet function .
