LPS-induced downregulation of Q92887 and O95342 in human liver is due to a posttranscriptional process . Endotoxin-induced cholestasis in rodents is caused by hepatic downregulation of transporters , including the basolateral Na+-dependent taurocholate transporter ( ntcp ) and the canalicular bile salt export pump ( bsep ) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 ( mrp2 ) . Details about the regulation of the human transporter proteins during this process are lacking . We used precision-cut human and rat liver slices to study the regulation of transporter expression during LPS-induced cholestasis . We investigated the effect of LPS on nitrate/nitrite and cytokine production in relation to the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase , Q14973 , O95342 , and Q92887 both at the level of mRNA with RT-PCR and protein using immunofluorescence microscopy . In liver slices from both species , LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was detected within 1-3 h and remained increased over 24 h . In rat liver slices , this was accompanied by a significant decrease of rat ntcp and mrp2 mRNA levels , whereas bsep levels were not affected . These results are in line with previous in vivo studies and validate our liver slice technique . In LPS-treated human liver slices , Q14973 mRNA was downregulated and showed an inverse correlation with the amounts of P01375 and Il-1beta produced . In contrast , Q92887 and O95342 mRNA levels were not affected under these conditions . However , after 24-h LPS challenge , both proteins were virtually absent in human liver slices , whereas marker proteins remained detectable . In conclusion , we show that posttranscriptional mechanisms play a more prominent role in LPS-induced regulation of human Q92887 and O95342 compared with the rat transporter proteins .
