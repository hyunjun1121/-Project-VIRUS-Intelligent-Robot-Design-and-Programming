Uptake and incorporation of pinolenic acid reduces n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid and downstream prostaglandin formation in murine macrophage . Many reports have shown the beneficial effects of consumption of pine seeds and pine seed oil . However , few studies have examined the biological effect of pinolenic acid ( PNA ; 5,9,12-18:3 ) , the main fatty acid in pine seed oil . In this study , using murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells as a model , we examined the effect of PNA on polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) metabolism , prostaglandin ( PG ) biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression . Results showed that PNA was readily taken up , incorporated and elongated to form eicosatrienoic acid ( ETrA , 7,11,14-20:3 ) in macrophage cells . A small portion of this elongated metabolite was further elongated to form 9,13,16-22:3 . The degree of incorporation of PNA and its metabolites into cellular phospholipids varied with the length of incubation time and the concentration of PNA in the medium . Incubation of PNA also modified the fatty acid profile of phospholipids : the levels of 18- and 20-carbon PUFA were significantly decreased , whereas those of 22-carbon fatty acids increased . This finding suggests that PNA enhances the elongation of 20-carbon fatty acids to 22-carbon fatty acids . The syntheses of PGE(1) from dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DB00154 , 8,11,14-20:4 ) and PGE(2) from arachidonic acid ( O95255 , 5,8,11,14-20:4 ) were also suppressed by the presence of PNA and its metabolite . As the expression of P35354 was not suppressed , the inhibitory effect of PNA on PG activity was attributed in part to substrate competition between the PNA metabolite ( i.e. , 7,11,14-20:3 ) and DB00154 ( or O95255 ) .
