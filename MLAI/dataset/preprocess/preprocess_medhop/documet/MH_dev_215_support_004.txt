Selective inhibitors of Q02750 /ERK44/42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases potentiate apoptosis induction by sulindac sulfide in human colon carcinoma cells . The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) sulindac prevents experimental colon cancer and can regress precancerous polyps in humans . Sulindac sulfide inhibits cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -mediated prostaglandin synthesis and retards the growth of cultured colon cell lines primarily by inducing apoptosis . Given the known role of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) in signal transduction and the regulation of cell survival and death , we determined the effect of sulindac sulfide on MAPK activation , P35354 expression , and apoptosis induction in HCA-7 human colon cancer cells . Sulindac sulfide treatment was associated with activation of ERKp44/42 and p38 MAPK in a dosage- and time-dependent manner , and also activated upstream MEK . Similar results were seen in HCT-15 cells and also with the selective P35354 inhibitor NS398 . ERKp44/42 and p38 activation were accompanied by an induction of P35354 protein expression . Selective inhibitors of sulindac sulfide-induced ERKp44/42 ( PD98059 ) and p38 MAPK ( SB203580 ) activation also suppressed the induction of P35354 by this NSAID . Furthermore , both MAPK inhibitors significantly augmented sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis , as did suppression of constitutive P35354 using antisense oligonucleotides . In conclusion , MEK/ P29323 and p38 MAPK activation mediate P35354 induction by sulindac sulfide . Selective inhibitors of these MAPKs potentiate apoptosis induction by this NSAID , suggesting a novel strategy for the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer .
