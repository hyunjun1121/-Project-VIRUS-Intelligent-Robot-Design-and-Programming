Comparison of diafiltration and tangential flow filtration for purification of nanoparticle suspensions . PURPOSE : The study reports evaluation of different purification processes for removing surplus surfactant and formulating stable nanoparticle dispersions . METHODS : Nanoparticle formulations prepared from poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) and polyvinyl alcohol ( P32926 ) were purified by a diafiltration centrifugal device ( P81605 ) , using 300K and 100K molecular weight cut-off ( MWCO ) membranes and a tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) system with a 300K MWCO membrane . The effects of process parameters including MWCO , transmembrane pressure ( P54849 ) , and mode of TFF on nanoparticle purification were evaluated , and two purification techniques were compared to the commonly used ultracentrifugation technique . RESULTS : Both P81605 and TFF systems ( concentration mode at P54849 of 10 psi ) with 300K MWCO membrane removed maximal percent P32926 from nanoparticle dispersions ( 89.0 and 90.7 % , respectively ) . T90 , the time taken to remove 90 % of P32926 in 200-ml sample , however , was considerably different ( 9.6 and 2.8 h , respectively ) . Purified nanoparticle dispersions were stable and free of aggregation at ambient conditions over 3 days . This is in contrast to the ultracentrifugation technique , which , although it can yield a highly purified sample , suffers from drawbacks of a level of irreversible nanoparticle aggregation and loss of fine particles in the supernatant during centrifugation . CONCLUSIONS : The TFF , in concentration mode at P54849 of 10 psi , is a relatively quick , efficient , and cost-effective technique for purification and concentration of a large nanoparticle batch ( > or=200 ml ) . The P81605 technique can be an alternative purification method for nanoparticle dispersions of small volumes .
