Functional methionine synthase deficiency ( cblE and cblG ) : clinical and biochemical heterogeneity . Functional methionine synthase deficiency is generally characterized by homocystinuria and hypomethioninemia in the absence of methylmalonic aciduria . Patients are divided into two classes , cblE and cblG , on the basis of complementation analysis . Presentation has usually been in the first 2 years of life , but one patient came to medical attention at age 21 years with symptoms initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis . Common findings among 11 patients ( 4 with cblE and 7 with cblG ) have included megaloblastic anemia ( all patients ) and various neurological deficits including developmental retardation ( 10 patients ) , cerebral atrophy ( 8 patients ) , hypotonia ( 7 patients ) , EEG abnormalities ( 6 patients ) , and nystagmus ( 5 patients ) . Hypertonia , seizures , blindness , and ataxia were less frequent . All patients have responded to therapy with cobalamin with resolution of anemia and biochemical abnormalities ; neurological deficits resolved more slowly and in some cases incompletely . DB00200 has been more effective than cyanocobalamin . Fibroblasts from patients with cblE ( 5 patients ) and cblG ( 6 patients ) all showed decreased intracellular levels of methylcobalamin ( DB03614 ) and decreased incorporation of label from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into macromolecules , suggesting decreased activity of the DB03614 -dependent enzyme methionine synthase . Q99707 specific activity in extracts of all cblE fibroblasts was normal or near-normal under standard reducing conditions ; synthase specific activity in extracts of 5 cblG patients was low but was high in a 6th patient measured in another laboratory . Thus , there is heterogeneity among patients with functional methionine synthase deficiency both in clinical presentation and in the results of biochemical studies of cultured cells .
