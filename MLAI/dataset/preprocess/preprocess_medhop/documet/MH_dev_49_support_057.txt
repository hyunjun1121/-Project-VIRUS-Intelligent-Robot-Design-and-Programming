Traps to catch unwary oncogenes . The MYC proto-oncogene has long been implicated in the control of normal cell growth and its deregulation is associated with the development of neoplasia . The MYC protein has a well-established role as a component of signal-transduction pathways promoting both proliferation and apoptosis . Because signalling pathways that drive cell death and cell proliferation are so tightly coupled , a synergy between genetic lesions leading to suppression of cell death and those promoting cell proliferation is observed during carcinogenesis . We discuss such synergy with respect to the cooperating oncogenes MYC , DB01367 and P10415 .
