Lectin-like oxidized P01130 -1 ( P78380 ) supports adhesion of mononuclear leukocytes and a monocyte-like cell line THP-1 cells under static and flow conditions . Adhesion of mononuclear leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells appears one of the initial steps in the process of atherogenesis and inflammation . We examined if P78380 , an endothelial scavenger receptor with C-type lectin-like structure , can support adhesion of mononuclear leukocytes . Under a static condition , CHO- P04264 cells stably expressing P78380 showed more prominent adhesion of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and THP-1 cells than untransfected CHO- P04264 cells , in a temperature-independent fashion . Mononuclear leukocytes also adhered to plastic plates precoated with recombinant soluble P78380 extracellular domain . A neutralizing anti- P78380 monoclonal antibody , as well as oxidized low-density lipoprotein , significantly blocked adhesion of THP-1 cells to CHO- P04264 cells overexpressing P78380 and bovine aortic endothelial cells . Under a flow condition , increased numbers of THP-1 cells showed rolling with reduced velocities on P78380 -expressing CHO- P04264 cells , compared with those on untransfected CHO- P04264 cells . Taken together , P78380 can work as a cell surface receptor for mononuclear leukocytes under both static and flow conditions .
