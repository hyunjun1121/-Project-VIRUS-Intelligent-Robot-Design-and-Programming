Opposite function of dopamine D1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in striatal cannabinoid-mediated signaling . It is well established that the cannabinoid and dopamine systems interact at various levels to regulate basal ganglia function . Although it is well known that acute administration of cannabinoids to mice can modify dopamine-dependent behaviors , the intraneuronal signaling pathways employed by these agents in the striatum are not well understood . Here we used knockout mouse models to examine the regulation of striatal extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) signaling by behaviorally relevant doses of cannabinoids . This cellular pathway has been implicated as a central mediator of drug reward and synaptic plasticity . In C57BL/6J mice , acute administration of the cannabinoid agonists , (-)-11-hydroxydimethylheptyl-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol ( HU-210 ) and DB00470 ( Δ(9) -THC ) , promoted a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 in dorsal striatum . Co-administration of the P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonist N-(Piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide(AM251) with HU-210 prevented P27361 /2 inactivation , indicating a requirement for activation of this receptor . In dopamine D1 receptor knockout animals treated with HU-210 , the magnitude of the HU-210-dependent decrease in striatal P27361 /2 signaling was greater than in wild-type controls . In contrast , HU-210 administration to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor knockdown mice was ineffective at promoting striatal P27361 /2 inactivation . Genetic deletion of other potential P27361 /2 mediators , the dopamine D2 receptors or β-arrestin-1 or -2 , did not affect the HU-210-induced modulation of P27361 /2 signaling in the striatum . These results support the hypothesis that dopamine D1 receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors act in an opposite manner to regulate striatal P21554 cannabinoid receptor signal transduction .
