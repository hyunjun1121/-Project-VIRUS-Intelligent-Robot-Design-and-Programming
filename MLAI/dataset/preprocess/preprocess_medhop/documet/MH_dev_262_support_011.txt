DB06813 : a novel synthetic antifolate for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and other potential uses . PURPOSE : The pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , clinical trials , adverse effects , dosage , and economic considerations of pralatrexate ( DB06813 ) are reviewed . SUMMARY : Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) comprises approximately 15-20 % of all aggressive lymphomas and 5-10 % of all non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas . Advanced PTCL is often refractory to traditional first-line chemotherapy regimens . DB06813 was developed as a synthetic folate analog antimetabolite that competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) . This results in the depletion of thymidine , leading to interference with deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and cancer cell death . DB06813 has a higher potency than methotrexate and edatrexate ( EDX ) . The efficacy and safety of DB06813 have been demonstrated in the PROPEL trial , a prospective phase II trial in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . Patients with prior stem cell transplantation receiving DB06813 also had similar response rates ( RRs ) . DB06813 was investigated on the treatment of relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer and other solid malignancies . DB06813 has similar side effects to other P00374 inhibitors . The most common side effect of DB06813 is mucositis . The recommended dose of DB06813 is 30 mg/m(2) weekly once for 6 weeks in 7-week cycle until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity for PTCL and may require dose reduction or discontinuation . Patients should be supplemented with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B(12) injections . CONCLUSION : DB06813 provides clinical benefit to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL with durable complete and partial responses in patients who had not responded to multiple prior treatment regimens .
