Expression and purification of the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin A : a single mutation abolishes its cleavage of P60880 and neurotoxicity after reconstitution with the heavy chain . Botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) selectively and irreversibly inhibits acetylcholine release from peripheral nerve endings . While the toxin 's heavy ( H ) chain contributes to neuronal binding and internalization , its light ( L ) chain is a Zn(2+)-dependent endoprotease that intracellularly cleaves synaptosomal-associated protein of M(r) = 25 kDa ( P60880 ) . For research and clinical exploitation of this uniquely-acting neurotoxin , recombinant wild-type L chain was produced together with a mutant in which His227 in the Zn(2+)-binding motif was substituted by DB00135 . The PCR-amplified wild-type and mutant L chain genes were cloned , fused to the gene for maltose-binding protein , and expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli . The soluble fusion proteins were purified using amylose affinity chromatography , and , after factor Xa cleavage , the free L chains were isolated . The wild-type was shown to proteolyze P60880 at a rate approaching that of the native chain while the mutant was inactive . Reconstitution of the pure wild-type L chain with native homogeneous H chain yielded a disulfide-linked dichain form that inhibited neuromuscular transmission in vitro and produced the symptoms of botulism in vivo . After reconstitution with the H chain , the Tyr227 mutant L chain failed to show any neuroparalytic activity in either of these assays . This methodology allows , for the first time , routine preparation of recombinant forms of the L chain that are needed to decipher the molecular details of its interaction with substrate and , thereby , assist the design of effective inhibitors.
