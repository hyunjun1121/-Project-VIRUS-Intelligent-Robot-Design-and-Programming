ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent phospholipase D2 activation is required for agonist-induced mu-opioid receptor endocytosis . Agonist exposure of many G protein-coupled receptors induces a rapid receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G proteins . Resensitization of these desensitized receptors requires endocytosis and subsequent dephosphorylation . Using a yeast two-hybrid screen , the rat mu-opioid receptor ( P35372 , also termed MOP ) was found to be associated with phospholipase D2 ( O14939 ) , a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane , which has been implicated in the formation of endocytotic vesicles . Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells coexpressing P35372 and O14939 confirmed that P35372 constitutively interacts with O14939 . Treatment with the mu receptor agonist DAMGO ( [ d-Ala(2) , Me DB00120 (4) , Glyol(5) ] enkephalin ) led to an increase in O14939 activity , whereas morphine , which does not induce P35372 receptor internalization , failed to induce O14939 activation . The DAMGO-mediated O14939 activation was inhibited by brefeldin A , an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation factor ( Q8N726 ) but not by the protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor calphostin C indicating that opioid receptor-mediated activation of O14939 is Q8N726 - but not PKC-dependent . Furthermore , heterologous stimulation of O14939 by phorbol ester led to an accelerated internalization of the mu-opioid receptor after both DAMGO and morphine exposure . Conversely the inhibition of O14939 -mediated phosphatidic acid formation by 1-butanol or overexpression of a negative mutant of O14939 prevented agonist-mediated endocytosis of P35372 . Together , these data suggest that O14939 play a key role in the regulation of agonist-induced endocytosis of the mu-opioid receptor .
