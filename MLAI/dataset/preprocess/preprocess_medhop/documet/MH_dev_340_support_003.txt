Bresol inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 gene expression and modulates the levels of select mediators of inflammation in human monocytic cells . Bresol-a poly-herbal formulation , has been reported to be effective against bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis in children . In vivo studies have supported the anti-histaminic and anti-anaphylactic action of bresol . However , the mechanism of action of bresol in modulation of inflammation has not been studied at the cellular and molecular level . The present study was aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) of action of bresol at the cellular and molecular levels , using human monocyte leukemia cells . The effects of bresol on phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) gene expression were analyzed using human monocytic U937 leukemia cells . The ability of bresol to stimulate DB02527 formation in these cells , as well as its effects on mediators of inflammation like tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNFα ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , and cycloxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated U937 cells , were also studied . The results here indicated that bresol exhibited potential anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting LPS-induced Q07343 gene expression in the cells . Bresol also dose dependently activated DB02527 formation , and inhibited TNFα , NO , as well as P35354 formation in the LPS-stimulated cells . Based upon the results , we concluded that the reported anti-inflammatory activity of bresol might be attributed to its abilities to inhibit Q07343 and thus elevate DB02527 levels in human monocytes . The anti-inflammatory effects of bresol might also be a result of the capacity of bresol to modulate the formation of TNFα , NO , and P35354 in monocytes .
