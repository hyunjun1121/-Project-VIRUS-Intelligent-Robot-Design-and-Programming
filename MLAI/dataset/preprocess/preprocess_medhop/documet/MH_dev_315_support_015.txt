Plumbagin inhibits tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo . Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumor development and metastatic progression , and anti-angiogenic drugs targeting the P15692 pathway have shown to decrease the disease progression in cancer patients . In this study , we have analyzed the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic property of plumbagin in cisplatin sensitive , P51587 deficient , DB09287 -1 and cisplatin resistant , P51587 proficient DB09287 -4 ovarian cancer cells . Both DB09287 -1 and DB09287 -4 ovarian cancer cells are sensitive to plumbagin irrespective of P51587 status in both normoxia and hypoxia . Importantly , plumbagin treatment effectively inhibits P15692 and Glut-1 in DB09287 -1 and DB09287 -4 ovarian cancer cells . We have also analyzed the p53 mutant , cisplatin resistant , and P51587 proficient OVCAR-5 cells . Plumbagin challenge also restricts the P15692 induced pro-angiogenic signaling in HUVECs and subsequently endothelial cell proliferation . In addition , we observe a significant effect on tumor regression among OVCAR-5 tumor-bearing mice treated with plumbagin , which is associated with significant inhibition of Ki67 and P04275 expressions . Plumbagin also significantly reduces CD31 expression in an ear angiogenesis assay . Collectively , our studies indicate that plumbagin , as an anti-cancer agent disrupts growth of ovarian cancer cells through the inhibition of proliferation as well as angiogenesis .
