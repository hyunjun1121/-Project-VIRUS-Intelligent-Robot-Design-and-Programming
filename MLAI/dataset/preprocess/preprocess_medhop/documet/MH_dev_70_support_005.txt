Rational drug design approach for overcoming drug resistance : application to pyrimethamine resistance in malaria . DB00205 acts by selectively inhibiting malarial dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase ( P00374 -TS ) . Resistance in the most important human parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , initially results from an S108N mutation in the P00374 domain , with additional mutation ( most commonly C59R or N51I or both ) imparting much greater resistance . From a homology model of the 3-D structure of P00374 -TS , rational drug design techniques have been used to design and subsequently synthesize inhibitors able to overcome malarial pyrimethamine resistance . Compared to pyrimethamine ( Ki 1.5 nM ) with purified recombinant P00374 fromP. falciparum , the Ki value of the m-methoxy analogue of pyrimethamine was 1.07 nM , but against the P00374 bearing the double mutation ( C59R + S108N ) , the Ki values for pyrimethamine and the m-methoxy analogue were 71.7 and 14.0 nM , respectively . The m-chloro analogue of pyrimethamine was a stronger inhibitor of both wild-type P00374 ( with Ki 0.30 nM ) and the doubly mutant ( C59R +S108N ) purified enzyme ( with Ki 2.40 nM ) . Growth of parasite cultures of P. falciparum in vitro was also strongly inhibited by these compounds with 50 % inhibition of growth occurring at 3.7 microM for the m-methoxy and 0.6 microM for the m-chloro compounds with the P04264 parasite line bearing the double mutation ( S108N + C59R ) , compared to 10.2 microM for pyrimethamine . These inhibitors were also found in preliminary studies to retain antimalarial activity in vivo in P. berghei-infected mice .
