Cytokine regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) expression on human glioblastoma cells . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) has recently been identified as one of the ligands for lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 ( LFA-1 ) . Immunohistochemical staining of frozen tissue sections using the P05362 antibody P23921 /1 demonstrated significant levels of P05362 expression on human glioblastoma cells and on intratumoural vascular endothelial cells . P05362 was weakly expressed or absent from low grade gliomas and absent from normal and fetal brain . P05362 expression was similar to that of MHC class II . HLA-DR antigens . Glioblastoma cell lines constitutively expressed P05362 to a minimal or moderate extent . Surface antigen expression of P05362 and P05362 -specific mRNA could be significantly increased by incubating glioblastoma cells with interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , and interferon-gamma ( P01579 ) . P60568 , P05112 , P05231 and transforming growth factor beta 2 ( TGF-beta 2 ) had no significant effect on surface antigen expression . Significant enhancement of P05362 expression was obtained using P01375 and P01584 at 1-10 U/ml and at 500 U/ml of P01579 . Induction of P05362 specific mRNA was observed 4 h after cytokine treatment and decreased by 24 h . Surface antigen expression of P05362 increased for up to 48 h after treatment .
