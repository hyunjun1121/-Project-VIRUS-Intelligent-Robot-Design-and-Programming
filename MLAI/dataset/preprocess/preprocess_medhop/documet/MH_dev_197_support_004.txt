DB00313 n-3 , DB00313 n-6 and DB01708 improve lipoprotein profiles and aortic function in hamsters fed a high cholesterol diet . The present study examined the cholesterol-lowering activity of omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid ( DB00313 n-3 ) , omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid ( DB00313 n-6 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DB01708 ) , and their interaction with gene expression of transporters , receptors and enzymes involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism as well as their effect on aortic function . Forty hamsters were fed either the control diet containing 0.4 % stearic acid or one of the three experimental diets containing 0.4 % DB00313 n-3 , 0.4 % DB00313 n-6 and 0.4 % DB01708 . Results showed that supplementation of these three fatty acids reduced plasma total cholesterol ( TC ) and non high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( non-HDL-C ) by 29-33 % and 29-50 % , respectively , compared with the control . The reduction in TC and non-HDL-C was accompanied by down-regulation of hepatic Q12772 and P04035 . Aorta from DB00313 n-3 and DB01708 groups was found to have significantly lesser tension and relax better than that from the control and DB00313 n-6 hamsters , largely mediated by their inhibition on the gene expression of cycloxygense-2 ( P35354 ) . It was concluded that all three fatty acids were beneficial in improving lipoprotein profile with DB00313 n-3 and DB01708 having better effect on aortic function .
