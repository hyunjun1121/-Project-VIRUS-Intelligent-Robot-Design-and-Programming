Increased serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera . Neutrophil gelatinaase-associated lipocalin ( P80188 ) is a glycoprotein bound with matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) in human neutrophils , and elevated tissue P80188 expression has been documented in different infectious and inflammatory conditions . Recent evidence suggests that P80188 expression is induced in many types of human cancer . Moreover , P80188 is required for P11274 - P00519 -induced tumorigenesis . The aim of the present study was to measure serum levels of P80188 in patients with essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) and polycythemia vera ( PV ) . We also evaluated P80188 levels in patients with ET and PV with and without thrombotic events , to explore a possible correlation of P80188 with platelet and leukocyte activation , and in patients with sepsis . Serum P80188 levels in the study population were significantly higher than in healthy adults and in subjects with sepsis . A correlation between P80188 and the number of white cells and neutrophils was found in patients with PV and ET . P80188 serum levels were not different depending on the presence or not of the O60674 mutation , and a mutant allele dosage effect was not observed for P80188 levels . Patients with PV and ET with thrombosis did not have significantly higher levels of P80188 . We were unable to demonstrate a significant association between serum P80188 levels and CD11b or CD62 expression . In conclusion , our study reports evidence demonstrating that increased levels of P80188 appear to be a characteristic of patients with PV and ET .
