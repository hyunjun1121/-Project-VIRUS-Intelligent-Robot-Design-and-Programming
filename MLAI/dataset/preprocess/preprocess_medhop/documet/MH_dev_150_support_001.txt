Drosophila Answers to Q13148 Proteinopathies . Initially implicated in the pathogenesis of P13569 and HIV-1 transcription , nuclear factor Q13148 was subsequently found to be involved in the origin and development of several neurodegenerative diseases . In 2006 , in fact , it was reported for the first time the cytoplasmic accumulation of Q13148 in ubiquitin-positive inclusions of P35858 and FTLD patients , suggesting the presence of a shared underlying mechanism for these diseases . Today , different animal models of Q13148 proteinopathies are available in rodents , nematodes , fishes , and flies . Although these models recapitulate several of the pathological features found in patients , the mechanisms underpinning the progressive neuronal loss observed in Q13148 proteinopathies remain to be characterized . Compared to other models , Drosophila are appealing because they combine the presence of a sophisticated brain with the possibility to investigate quickly and massively phenotypic genetic modifiers as well as possible therapeutic strategies . At present , the development of Q13148 -related Drosophila models has further strengthened the hypothesis that both Q13148 " loss-of-function " and " gain-of-function " mechanisms can contribute to disease . The aim of this paper is to describe and compare the results obtained in a series of transgenic and knockout flies , along with the information they have generated , towards a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying Q13148 proteinopathies .
