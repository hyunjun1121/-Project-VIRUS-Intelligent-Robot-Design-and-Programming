Combined effect of rapamycin and cisplatin on survival of Hep-2 cells in vitro . The cytotoxic effects and mechanism of action of cisplatin and the P42345 inhibitor rapamycin on Hep-2 laryngeal cancer cells were investigated . Hep-2 cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of rapamycin , cisplatin , or the two combined . Inhibition of cell growth , apoptosis , and AKT , P42345 , S6K , and P07992 protein levels were assessed . All combinations of rapamycin and cisplatin resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell growth ( as indicated by q values determined using Jin 's formula > 1.15 ) . DB00877 inhibited Hep-2 cell growth , induced P55008 arrest , and when combined with cisplatin , enhanced apoptosis . p- P42345 and S6K expressions were significantly downregulated by rapamycin . P07992 expression was significantly upregulated with cisplatin treatment . Combined cisplatin and rapamycin treatment resulted in significant downregulated p- P42345 and S6K expression , but no change in P07992 expression . DB00877 and cisplatin act in a synergistic manner , increasing the cytotoxic effect on Hep-2 cells . DB00877 may facilitate increased Hep-2 cell apoptosis with cisplatin via inhibiting downstream expression of proteins in the AKT- P42345 signaling pathway .
