Genomic comparison of Escherichia coli P04264 strains isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis . Escherichia coli is a major cause of enteric/diarrheal diseases , urinary tract infections , and sepsis . E. coli P04264 is the leading gram-negative organism causing neonatal meningitis , but the microbial basis of E. coli P04264 meningitis is incompletely understood . Here we employed comparative genomic hybridization to investigate 11 strains of E. coli P04264 isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) of patients with meningitis . These 11 strains cover the majority of common O serotypes in E. coli P04264 isolates from P04141 . Our data demonstrated that these 11 strains of E. coli P04264 can be categorized into two groups based on their profile for putative virulence factors , lipoproteins , proteases , and outer membrane proteins . Of interest , we showed that some open reading frames ( ORFs ) encoding the type III secretion system apparatus were found in group 2 strains but not in group 1 strains , while ORFs encoding the general secretory pathway are predominant in group 1 strains . These findings suggest that E. coli P04264 strains isolated from P04141 can be divided into two groups and these two groups of E. coli P04264 may utilize different mechanisms to induce meningitis .
