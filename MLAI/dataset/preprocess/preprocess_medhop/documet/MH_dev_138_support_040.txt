Separation and purification of the tonoplast ATPase and pyrophosphatase from plants with constitutive and inducible Crassulacean acid metabolism . Tonoplast vesicles were isolated from Kalanchoe daigremontiana Hamet et Pierrer de la BÃ¢thie and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. , exhibiting constitutive and inducible crassulacean acid metabolism ( P62158 ) , respectively . Membrane-bound proteins were detergent-solubilized with 2 % of Triton X-100 . During P62158 induction in M. crystallinum , ATPase activity increases four-fold , whereas pyrophosphatase activity decreases somewhat . With all plants , ATPase and pyrophosphatase could be separated by size-exclusion chromatography ( SEC , Sephacryl S 400 ) , and the ATPase was further purified by diethylaminoethyl-ion-exchange chromatography . Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate electrophoresis of the SEC fractions from K. daigremontiana containing maximum ATPase activity separates several protein bands , indicating subunits of 72 , 56 , 48 , 42 , 28 , and 16 kDa . Purified ATPase from M. crystallinum in the P01024 and P62158 states shows a somewhat different protein pattern . With M. crystallinum , an increase in DB00171 -hydrolysis and changes in the subunit composition of the native enzyme indicate that the change from the P01024 to the P62158 state is accompanied by de-novo synthesis and by structural changes of the tonoplast ATPase .
