Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors suppress synthesis of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Administration of angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors reduce vascular proliferation following endothelial injury as well as progression of renal disease in various animal models . These effects might be due to interference with cytokines such as interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) or tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) since they have been implicated in regulating the effects of vascular cell growth factors such as fibroblast- and platelet-derived growth factors . We investigated the in vitro synthesis of IL-1 and P01375 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) in the presence of various P12821 -inhibitors . DB01197 dose-dependently suppressed the P01584 -induced synthesis of P01375 by 74 % ( P < 0.01 ) and the P01584 -induced synthesis of P01583 by 60 % ( P < 0.01 ) . Cytokine synthesis induced by lipopolysaccharide was less affected . At concentrations suppressing P01375 and IL-1 , captopril did not reduce the synthesis of complement P01024 in the same cells . Enalapril and cilazapril also suppressed cytokine-induced cytokine synthesis . Ramipril , lisinopril , perindopril and spirapril had no significant effect on P01375 synthesis suggesting that the effect was not related specifically to the inhibition of P12821 . Accumulation of mRNA for IL-1 and P01375 were not affected by captopril , suggesting a posttranscriptional effect . We conclude that certain P12821 -inhibitors suppress IL-1 and P01375 synthesis at a posttranscriptional level and might therefore influence cytokine-mediated cell growth .
