Analysis of common gene expression patterns in four human tumor cell lines exposed to camptothecin using cDNA microarray : identification of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage response pathways . DB04690 ( CPT ) is a potent inhibitor of P11387 with a wide spectrum of anti-tumor activity . Relatively little information is available regarding the relation of known topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage with other intracellular pathways . To gain an insight into the intracellular molecular mechanisms of Topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin-mediated DNA damage leading to cell death , we used a high-density cDNA microarray to assess sensitive early gene expression profiles in SGC7901 ( gastric cancer ) , Hela ( cervical adenocarcinoma ) , K562 ( chronic myelogenous leukemia ) and HL60 ( promyelocytic leukemia ) tumor cells stimulated with camptothecin for 1 h at the concentrations of GI50 ( 50 % growth inhibition after 24 h of treatment ) . Analysis of the differentially expressed genes obtained 29 response genes common to all four cell lines . Moreover , these cell lines also shared the direction of regulation . Most of these common response genes were functionally related to cell proliferation or apoptosis , and some of them were involved in Q13315 ( ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ) and ATR ( Q13315 -and Rad3 related ) checkpoint pathways , JNK ( c-Jun N-terminal kinase ) pathway , the survival phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3 kinase-Akt-dependent pathway , mitochondrial cell death pathway , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) -related cell death pathway , and to ubiquitin/proteasome dependent protein degradation pathway . The data provides evidence for a linkage between topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage and intracellular signaling events , which may facilitate our understanding of the camptothecin mediated molecular mechanisms of action .
