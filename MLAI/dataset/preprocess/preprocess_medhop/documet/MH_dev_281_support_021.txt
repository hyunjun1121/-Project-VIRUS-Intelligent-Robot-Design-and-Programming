PDE4B5 , a novel , super-short , brain-specific DB02527 phosphodiesterase-4 variant whose isoform-specifying N-terminal region is identical to that of DB02527 phosphodiesterase-4D6 ( PDE4D6 ) . The DB02527 -specific phosphodiesterase-4 ( DB05876 ) gene family is the target of several potential selective therapeutic inhibitors . The four DB05876 genes generate several distinct protein-coding isoforms through the use of alternative promoters and 5'-coding exons . Using mouse transcripts , we identified a novel , super-short isoform of human Q07343 encoding a novel 5' terminus , which we label PDE4B5 . The protein-coding region of the novel 5' exon is conserved across vertebrates , chicken , zebrafish , and fugu . Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and quantitative ( PCR ) measurements show that this isoform is brain-specific . The novel protein is 58 +/- 2 kDa ; it has DB02527 hydrolyzing enzymatic activity and is inhibited by DB05876 -selective inhibitors rolipram and cilomilast ( DB03849 ) . Confocal and subcellular fractionation analyses show that it is distributed predominantly and unevenly within the cytosol . The 16 novel N-terminal residues of PDE4B5 are identical to the 16 N-terminal residues of the super-short isoform of Q08499 ( PDE4D6 ) , which is also brain-specific . PDE4B5 is able to bind the scaffold protein Q9NRI5 , whose gene has been linked to schizophrenia . Microarray expression profiling of the DB05876 gene family shows that specific DB05876 genes are enriched in muscle and blood fractions ; however , only by monitoring the individual isoforms is the brain specificity of the super-short Q08499 and Q07343 isoforms revealed . Understanding the distinct tissue specificity of DB05876 isoforms will be important for understanding phosphodiesterase biology and opportunities for therapeutic intervention .
