Differential involvement of Galpha12 and Galpha13 in receptor-mediated stress fiber formation . The ubiquitously expressed heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins ( G-proteins ) G12 and Q99941 have been shown to activate the small GTPase Rho . Rho stimulation leads to a rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequent stress fiber formation . We investigated the involvement of G12 or Q99941 in stress fiber formation induced through a variety of Gq/ P49842 -coupled receptors . Using fibroblast cell lines derived from wild-type and Galphaq/Galpha11-deficient mice , we show that agonist-dependent activation of the endogenous receptors for thrombin or lysophosphatidic acid and of the heterologously expressed bradykinin B2 , vasopressin V1A , endothelin P25101 , and serotonin P28335 receptors induced stress fiber formation in either the presence or absence of Galphaq/Galpha11 . Stress fiber assembly induced through the muscarinic M1 and the metabotropic glutamate subtype 1alpha receptors was dependent on Gq/ P49842 proteins . The activation of the Gq/ P49842 -coupled endothelin ETB and angiotensin AT1A receptors failed to induce stress fiber formation . Lysophosphatidic acid , B2 , and P28335 receptor-mediated stress fiber formation was dependent on Galpha13 and involved epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) receptors , whereas thrombin , P25101 , and V1A receptors induced stress fiber accumulation via Galpha12 in an P01133 receptor-independent manner . Our data demonstrate that many Gq/ P49842 -coupled receptors induce stress fiber assembly in the absence of Galphaq and Galpha11 and that this involves either a Galpha12 or a Galpha13/ P01133 receptor-mediated pathway .
