Constructing glucagon like peptide-1 receptor fused with derivatives of GFP for visualizing protein-protein interaction in living cells . The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( P43220 ) mediates important antidiabetogenic effects on peripheral tissues . It appears to be one of the most promising therapeutic targets for treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 . Surprisingly , very little is known about the cellular mechanisms that regulate receptor function in living cells . One of the approaches how to study receptor dynamics is by using tagged fluorescent proteins . In this study , YFP-tagged P0C6A0 ( YFP- P0C6A0 ) receptor and P27918 -tagged P0C6A0 ( P27918 - P0C6A0 ) receptor for visualizing protein-protein interaction in living cells were constructed and localized in CHO cells . Cells expressing YFP- P0C6A0 and P27918 - P43220 showed characteristic P0C6A0 mediated increase in DB02527 , similar to cells expressing a wild type P43220 . This means that both types of receptors are functional and localized in plasma membrane .
