Modulation of cytokine production and enhancement of cell viability by Q9NYK1 and Q9NR96 ligands during anthrax infection of macrophages . Inhalation of Bacillus anthracis , a bioterrorism agent , results in a high mortality rate despite appropriate antibiotic therapy . Macrophages appear to be a key factor in B. anthracis pathogenesis . The burst of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages could be a major cause of death in anthrax . However , preactivation of Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) could modify the host response . TLR ligands stimulate the release of activating cytokines but may also down-modulate the subsequent deleterious cytokine response to pathogens . We developed a cell culture model to measure macrophage responses to B. anthracis spores and bacilli . We found that germination from spores to bacilli produced a substantial stimulus for the secretion of the cytokines P05231 , P01375 , P22301 , and IL-12 p40 . Our studies showed that pretreatment of mouse macrophages with the Q9NR96 ligand DB05463 , or the Q9NYK1 ligands R-848 and IT-37 , results in a substantial decrease in the subsequent secretion of P05231 and P01375 in response to B. anthracis infection of macrophages . Furthermore , the Q9NYK1 and Q9NR96 ligands significantly decreased anthrax-induced cytotoxicity in the macrophages . These findings suggest that TLR ligands may contribute to the enhancement of innate immunity in B. anthracis infection by suppressing potentially deleterious pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and by improving macrophage viability .
