Quinolinol and peptide inhibitors of zinc protease in botulinum neurotoxin A : effects of zinc ion and peptides on inhibition . Quinolinol derivatives were found to be effective inhibitors of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A ( DB00083 ) . Studies of the inhibition and binding of 7-(phenyl(8-quinolinylamino)methyl)-8-quinolinol ( QAQ ) to the light chain domain ( DB00083 LC ) showed that QAQ is a non-competitive inhibitor for the zinc protease activity . Binding and molecular modeling studies reveal that QAQ binds to a hydrophobic pocket near the active site . Its inhibitor effect does not involve the removal of zinc ion from the light chain . A 24-mer P60880 peptide containing E183 to G206 with Q197C mutation ( Peptide C ) binds to DB00083 LC with an unusually slow second order binding rate constant of 76.7M(-1)s(-1) . QAQ binds to Zn(2+)-free DB00083 LC with a K(D) of 0.67microM and to Peptide C- DB00083 LC complex with a K(D) of 2.33microM . The insights of the interactions of quinolinols and peptides with the zinc protease of DB00083 should aid in the development of inhibitors of metalloproteases .
