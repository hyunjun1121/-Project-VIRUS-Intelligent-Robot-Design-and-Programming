The non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue SDZ NIM 811 inhibits cyclophilin A incorporation into virions and virus replication in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected primary and growth-arrested T cells . SDZ NIM 811 is a cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) analogue that is completely devoid of immunosuppressive capacity but exhibits potent and selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) activity . Binding to cyclophilin A , the intracellular receptor for cyclosporins , is a prerequisite for HIV-1 inhibition by cyclosporins . P62937 was demonstrated to bind to HIV-1 p24gag and this cyclophilin-Gag interaction leads to the incorporation of cyclophilin A into HIV-1 virions . SDZ NIM 811 inhibits this protein interaction , and this is likely to be the molecular basis for its antiviral activity . Here , we show that in activated primary T cells SDZ NIM 811 interferes with two stages of the virus replication cycle : ( i ) translocation of pre-integration complexes into the nucleus and ( ii ) production of infectious virus particles . SDZ NIM 811 not only inhibits translocation of HIV-1 pre-integration complexes in primary T cells , but also in a growth-arrested T cell line . In vivo , most T lymphocytes are quiescent , but serve nevertheless as a major and inducible HIV-1 reservoir in infected individuals . Significant amounts of cyclophilin A were found to be associated with virus particles propagated in primary T cells . SDZ NIM 811 caused a strong reduction in the amount of incorporated cyclophilin A , thereby reducing infectivity . Thus , cyclophilin A seems to be necessary for HIV-1 replication in primary T cells .
