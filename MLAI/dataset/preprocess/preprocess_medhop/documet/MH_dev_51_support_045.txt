Sustained vascular endothelial growth factor delivery enhances angiogenesis and perfusion in ischemic hind limb . PURPOSE : We hypothesized that sustained delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) using a polymer [ 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) ] would enhance angiogenesis and improve perfusion of ischemic tissue . METHODS : C57BL/6J mice ( n = 20/group ) underwent unilateral hind limb ischemia surgery and were randomized to groups of no scaffold implantation ( 0-Implant ) , unloaded scaffold implantation ( Empty- P00747 ) , or implantation of scaffolds incorporating 3 microg of VEGF165 ( P00747 - P15692 ) . Endpoints included laser Doppler perfusion imaging ( LDPI , ischemic/nonischemic limb , % ) , local vessel counts , immunohistochemistry for CD31 , and alpha-smooth muscle actin . In vitro release kinetics of P15692 from P00747 was also measured . RESULTS : P00747 - P15692 resulted in improved lower extremity perfusion vs. controls as measured by LDPI % at 7 , 14 , 21 , and 28 days ( p < 0.05 ) . P00747 - P15692 was associated with significantly greater percentage of vessels staining for CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin compared to the Empty- P00747 or 0-Implant ( p < 0.05 for both ) . CONCLUSIONS : The P00747 - P15692 scaffolds resulted in sustained P15692 delivery , improved tissue perfusion , greater capillary density , and more mature vasculature compared to the controls . The sustained-release P00747 polymer vehicle is a promising delivery system for therapeutic neovascularization applications .
