Role of microRNA 1207-5P and its host gene , the long non-coding RNA Pvt1 , as mediators of extracellular matrix accumulation in the kidney : implications for diabetic nephropathy . Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of chronic kidney failure and end-stage renal disease in the Western World . One of the major characteristics of this disease is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) in the kidney glomeruli . While both environmental and genetic determinants are recognized for their role in the development of diabetic nephropathy , epigenetic factors , such as DNA methylation , long non-coding RNAs , and microRNAs , have also recently been found to underlie some of the biological mechanisms , including Q13201 accumulation , leading to the disease . We previously found that a long non-coding RNA , the plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 ( PVT1 ) , increases plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( P05121 ) and transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF-β1 ) in mesangial cells , the two main contributors to Q13201 accumulation in the glomeruli under hyperglycemic conditions , as well as fibronectin 1 ( P02751 ) , a major Q13201 component . Here , we report that miR-1207-5p , a PVT1-derived microRNA , is abundantly expressed in kidney cells , and is upregulated by glucose and TGF-β1 . We also found that like PVT1 , miR-1207-5p increases expression of TGF-β1 , P05121 , and P02751 but in a manner that is independent of its host gene . In addition , regulation of miR-1207-5p expression by glucose and TGFβ1 is independent of PVT1 . These results provide evidence supporting important roles for miR-1207-5p and its host gene in the complex pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
