The mode of action of methotrexate-monoclonal antibody conjugates . Drug-monoclonal antibody conjugates have been evaluated for their specificity and toxicity towards tumour cells in vitro and in vivo ; however , few studies have investigated their mode of entry into cells and mechanism of action . In this study the uptake and toxic effect of three different DB00563 -monoclonal antibody ( MTX-MoAb ) conjugates ( MTX-anti-transferrin receptor ( TFR ) , MTX-anti-Ly-2.1 and MTX-anti-L3T4 ) were examined and compared with free MTX . It was concluded that MTX and these MTX-MoAb conjugates gain entry into tumour cells and are processed by different mechanisms , considering the following results : alterations in temperature had a greater effect on the toxicity of MTX-MoAb than on MTX ; in addition , MTX and MTX-MoAb had different rates of action on cells ; the specific MTX transport inhibitor , p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonate ( pCMS ) , reduced MTX toxicity but had no effect on specific MTX-MoAb conjugates ; the concentration of various ions ( Ca2+ , Mg2+ and Mn2+ ) effected the entry of MTX-MoAb but had no effect on free MTX . MTX enters by its own carrier mechanism , while MTX-MoAb conjugates enter by endocytosis with release of MTX at the lysosomal membrane , demonstrated by the ability of chloroquine and NH4Cl ( which inhibit lysosomal function ) to inhibit the action of MTX-MoAb but not MTX . Therefore , these MTX-MoAb conjugates are not degraded at the surface but bind to their receptor and then enter the cell by endocytosis as one entity ; the MTX-MoAb conjugates are then degraded within the lysosomes , resulting in the release of free MTX into the cytoplasm where it acts on dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) to inhibit cell metabolism .
