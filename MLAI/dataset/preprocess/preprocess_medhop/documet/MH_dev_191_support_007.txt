FTY720 induces autophagy-related apoptosis and necroptosis in human glioblastoma cells . FTY720 is a potent immunosuppressant which has preclinical antitumor efficacy in various cancer models . However , its role in glioblastoma remains unclear . In the present study , we found that FTY720 induced extrinsic apoptosis , necroptosis and autophagy in human glioblastoma cells . Inhibition of autophagy by either RNA interference or chemical inhibitors attenuated FTY720-induced apoptosis and necrosis . Furthermore , autophagy , apoptosis and necrosis induction were dependent on reactive oxygen species-c-Jun N-terminal kinase-protein 53 ( ROS-JNK-p53 ) loop mediated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase ( PI3K/AKT/ P42345 /p70S6K ) pathway . In addition , receptor-interacting protein 1 and 3 ( Q13546 and RIP3 ) served as an upstream of ROS-JNK-p53 loop . However , the phosphorylation form of FTY720 induced autophagy but not apoptosis and necroptosis . Finally , the in vitro results were validated in vivo in xenograft mouse of glioblastoma cells . In conclusion , the current study provided novel insights into understanding the mechanisms and functions of FTY720-induced apoptosis , necroptosis and autophagy in human glioblastoma cells .
