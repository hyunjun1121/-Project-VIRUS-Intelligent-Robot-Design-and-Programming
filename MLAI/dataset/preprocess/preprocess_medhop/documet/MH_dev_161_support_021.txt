Inherited disorders of cytokines . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Cytokines are soluble mediators involved in the development or function of the immune system . This paper reviews the literature on childhood-onset inherited disorders associated with impaired cytokine-mediated immunity . RECENT FINDINGS : Cytokine-mediated immunity defects can be classified into seven different groups : defects in the interleukin ( IL ) -7 receptor ( IL7RA ) , in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gammac ) of the P60568 , -4 , -7 , -15 , and -21 , and in Jak3 ( P52333 ) downstream of the gamma chain ; mutation in the P60568 receptor alpha ( IL-2RA ) and defective expression of the IL-2Rbeta chain ; mutations in the gene encoding for a chemokine receptor , P61073 ; mutations in five genes involved in the IL-12/23-interferon-gamma axis ( P29460 , P42701 , P15260 , P38484 , P42224 ) ; mutations in three genes involved in the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway ( Q9NWZ3 , Q9Y6K9 , IkappaBA ) ; mutations in the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway ( P19438 ) ; and mutations in the transforming growth factor-1 gene ( P01137 ) . SUMMARY : Genetic cytokine-mediated immunity defects are associated with a highly heterogeneous group of clinical features , ranging from susceptibility to infections to developmental defects . This heterogeneity highlights the diversity and pleiotropy of cytokines . It is likely that many more cytokine defects and their responsive pathways will be discovered in the coming years , expanding further the heterogeneity associated with this group of childhood-onset illnesses .
