DB06612 for difficult-to-control asthma with persistent sputum eosinophilia . BACKGROUND : In asthma , anti-inflammatory therapy can usually reduce airway eosinophilic inflammation ; but in certain subgroups this persists despite maximal therapy , and disease control is suboptimal . DB06612 is an anti P05113 . antibody that might reduce airway inflammation in such subgroups . METHODS AND RESULTS : Evaluation of the efficacy and safety data on mepolizumab in two studies performed in patients with refractory and corticosteroid-dependent asthma with persistent sputum eosinophilia . DB06612 given intravenously once a month was able to reduce sputum/blood eosinophilia and asthma exacerbations and to improve quality of life . CONCLUSIONS : DB06612 may be a promising anti-inflammatory therapy in asthma subgroups with heavy eosinophilic load in which conventional anti-inflammatory therapy is only partially effective .
