Neutrophil P16109 -glycoprotein-ligand-1 binding to platelet P16109 enhances metalloproteinase 2 secretion and platelet-neutrophil aggregation . Platelets and neutrophils constitute a high source of metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , and their interactions via P16109 and P16109 -glycoprotein-ligand-1 ( Q14242 ) are involved in thrombosis , vascular remodelling , and restenosis . We investigated the impact of these interactions on platelet P08253 secretion and function in platelet and neutrophil aggregation . The secretion of P08253 from human platelets was significantly increased three-fold after thrombin activation , and enhanced two-fold in the presence of neutrophils . Neutrophil supernatant had no effect on platelet P08253 secretion . While no P08253 was detected in the supernatant of neutrophils , a high amount of P14780 was released by neutrophils , and remained unchanged upon thrombin activation or in the presence of platelets . Platelet P16109 , which increased significantly after activation , triggered platelet binding to neutrophils that was completely inhibited by P16109 or Q14242 antagonists , and was reduced by 50 % with a P08514 / IIIa antagonist . P16109 or Q14242 antagonism abolished the enhanced secretion of platelet P08253 in the presence of neutrophils and reduced platelet-neutrophil aggregation . Platelet activation and binding to neutrophils enhance the secretion of platelet P08253 via an adhesive interaction between P16109 and Q14242 , which contribute to increase platelet-neutrophil aggregation .
