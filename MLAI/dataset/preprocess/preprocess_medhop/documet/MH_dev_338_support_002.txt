Growth factors and glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats : effects of exercise training . To investigate the alterations of glucose homeostasis and variables of the insulin-like growth factor-1 ( DB01277 ) growth system in sedentary and trained diabetic ( TD ) rats , Wistar rats were divided into sedentary control ( SC ) , trained control ( TC ) , sedentary diabetic ( SD ) , and TD groups . Diabetes was induced by Alloxan ( 35 mg kg(-1) b.w. ) . Training program consisted of swimming 5 days week(-1) , 1 h day(-1) , during 8 weeks . Rats were sacrificed and blood was collected for determinations of serum glucose , insulin , growth hormone ( GH ) , DB01277 , and IGF binding protein-3 ( P17936 ) . Muscle and liver were removed to evaluate glycogen content . Cerebellum was extracted to determinate DB01277 content . Diabetes decreased serum GH , DB01277 , P17936 , liver glycogen , and cerebellum DB01277 peptide content in baseline condition . Physical training recovered liver glycogen and increased serum and cerebellum DB01277 peptide in diabetic rats . Physical training induces important metabolic and hormonal alterations that are associated with an improvement in glucose homeostasis and serum and cerebellum DB01277 concentrations .
