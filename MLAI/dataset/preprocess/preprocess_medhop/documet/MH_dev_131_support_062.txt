Naive P01730 t cell proliferation is controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin regulation of Q8TEB7 expression . In this study , we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase gene related to anergy in lymphocytes ( Q8TEB7 ) is expressed in quiescent naive mouse and human P01730 T cells and has a functional role in inhibiting naive T cell proliferation . Following TCR engagement , P10747 costimulation results in the expression of P60568 whose signaling through its receptor activates the Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) pathway . Activation of P42345 allows selective mRNA translation , including the epistatic regulator of Q8TEB7 , Q96FW1 ( Otub1 ) , whose expression results in the degradation of Q8TEB7 and allows T cell proliferation . The activation of P42345 appears to be the critical component of IL-2R signaling regulating Q8TEB7 expression . P16410 -Ig treatment blocks P10747 costimulation and resultant P60568 expression , whereas rapamycin and anti- P60568 treatment block P42345 activation downstream of IL-2R signaling . Thus , all three of these biotherapeutics inhibit P42345 -dependent translation of mRNA transcripts , resulting in blockade of Otub1 expression , maintenance of Q8TEB7 , and inhibition of P01730 T cell proliferation . These observations provide a mechanistic pathway sequentially linking P10747 costimulation , IL-2R signaling , and P42345 activation as important requirements for naive P01730 T cell proliferation through the regulation of Otub1 and Q8TEB7 expression . Our findings also extend the role of Q8TEB7 beyond anergy induction and maintenance , suggesting that endogenous Q8TEB7 regulates general cell cycle and proliferation of primary naive P01730 T cells .
