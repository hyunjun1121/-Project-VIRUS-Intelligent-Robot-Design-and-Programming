P10145 and P14902 expression by human gingival fibroblasts via TLRs . Human gingival fibroblasts ( HGFs ) , a predominant cell type in tooth-supporting structure , are presently recognized for their active role in the innate immune response . They produce a variety of inflammatory cytokines in response to microbial components such as LPS from the key periodontal pathogen , Porphyromonas gingivalis . In this study , we demonstrated that HGFs expressed mRNA of TLRs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 9 , but not TLRs 7 , 8 , and 10 . Stimulation of HGFs with highly purified O60603 ligand ( P. gingivalis LPS ) , O15455 ligand ( poly(I:C) ) , O00206 ligand ( Escherichia coli LPS ) , and O60602 ligand ( Salmonella typhimurium flagellin ) led to expression of P10145 and P14902 . A potent TLR 9 ligand , CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 had no effect , although HGFs showed a detectable Q9NR96 mRNA expression . No significant enhancement on P10145 or P14902 expression was observed when HGFs were stimulated with various combinations of TLR ligands . Surprisingly , the Q9NR96 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 was able to specifically inhibit poly(I:C)-induced P10145 and P14902 expression . P01375 enhanced TLR ligand-induced P10145 production in HGFs , whereas P01579 enhanced TLR ligand-induced P14902 expression . P14210 production of P14902 in response to P. gingivalis LPS , P01579 , or the two in combination inhibited T cell proliferation in MLRs . The observed T cell inhibition could be reversed by addition of either 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan or l-tryptophan . Our results suggest an important role of HGFs not only in orchestrating the innate immune response , but also in dampening potentially harmful hyperactive inflammation in periodontal tissue .
