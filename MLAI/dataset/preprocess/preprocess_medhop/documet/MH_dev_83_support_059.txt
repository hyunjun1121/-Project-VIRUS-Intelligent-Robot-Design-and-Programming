Transgenic Panax ginseng inhibits the production of P01375 , P05231 , and P10145 as well as P35354 expression in human mast cells . The most well-known medicinal plant , Panax ginseng ( P. ginseng ) , contains various phytosterols and bioactive triterpene saponins ( ginsenosides ) . P37268 is a key regulatory enzyme for triterpene biosynthesis and overexpression of the squalene synthase confers the hyper-production of triterpene saponins to form transgenic ginseng . In this study , we have investigated whether and how transgenic P. ginseng modulates an inflammatory reaction in a stimulated human mast cell line , HMC-1 . It was found that transgenic P. ginseng inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , P10145 , and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) plus calcium ionophore A23187 ( PMACI ) -stimulated HMC-1 . Additionally , we have shown that transgenic P. ginseng suppressed the intracellular calcium level induced by PMACI . These results provide new insights into the pharmacological actions of transgenic P. ginseng as a potential molecule for use in therapy in mast cell-mediated inflammatory diseases .
