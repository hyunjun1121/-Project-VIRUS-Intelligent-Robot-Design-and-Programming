Oral administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activator ameliorates diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction . We evaluated the hypothesis that activation of endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) 2 would improve cardiac dysfunction induced by diabetes . Ten days after diabetes induction ( streptozotocin , 50 mg/kg , i.v. ) , male Wistar rats were treated with the Q9BYF1 activator 1-[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amino]-4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-[[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-9H-xanthen-9-one ( XNT , 1 mg/kg/day , gavage ) or saline ( control ) for 30 days . Echocardiography was performed to analyze the cardiac function and kinetic fluorogenic assays were used to determine cardiac P12821 and Q9BYF1 activities . Cardiac Q9BYF1 , P12821 , Mas receptor , AT(1) receptor , AT(2) receptor and collagen types I and III mRNA and Q9BYF1 , P12821 , Mas , AT(1) receptor , AT(2) receptor , P27361 /2 , Akt , AMPK-α and AMPK-β(1) protein were measured by qRT-PCR and western blotting techniques , respectively . Histological sections of hearts were analyzed to evaluate the presence of hypertrophy and fibrosis . Diabetic animals presented hyperglycemia and diastolic dysfunction along with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis . XNT treatment prevented further increase in glycemia and improved the cardiac function , as well as the hypertrophy and fibrosis . These effects were associated with increases in cardiac Q9BYF1 / P12821 ratios ( activity : ~26 % ; mRNA : ~113 % ; and protein : ~188 % ) and with a decrease in AT(1) receptor expression . Additionally , XNT inhibited P27361 /2 phosphorylation and prevented changes in AMPK-α and AMPK-β(1) expressions . XNT treatment did not induce any significant change in AT(2) receptor and Akt expression . These results indicate that activation of intrinsic cardiac Q9BYF1 by oral XNT treatment protects the heart against diabetes-induced dysfunction through mechanisms involving P12821 , Q9BYF1 , P27361 /2 , AMPK-α and AMPK-β(1) modulations .
