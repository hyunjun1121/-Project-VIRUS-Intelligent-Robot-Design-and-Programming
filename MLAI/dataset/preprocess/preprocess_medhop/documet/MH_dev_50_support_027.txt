Role of chloride transport proteins in the vasorelaxant action of nitroprusside in isolated rat aorta . Chloride ions play a key role in smooth muscle contraction , but little is known concerning their role in smooth muscle relaxation . Here we investigated the effect of chloride transport inhibitors on the vasorelaxant responses to nitroprusside in isolated and endothelium-denuded rat aorta , precontracted with phenylephrine 1 muM . Incubation of aortic rings in NO(3)(-) media strongly potentiated the vasorelaxant responses to nitroprusside . DB00887 , DIDS ( 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid ) and acetazolamide strongly potentiated the vasorelaxant responses to nitroprusside ( by 70-100 % ) . EC(50) were 2.3+/-0.5 microM for bumetanide , 26+/-15 microM for DIDS and 510+/-118 microM for acetazolamide ( n=6 for condition ) . Niflumic acid , a selective inhibitor of ClCa ( calcium-activated chloride channels ) , potentiated nitroprusside relaxation to a similar extent as chloride transport inhibitors , in a non-additive manner . Zinc and nickel ions , both modestly potentiated nitroprusside vasorelaxation ( by 20-30 % ) . Cobaltum had negligible effect on nitroprusside vasorelaxation . P15085 ( p-chlorophenoxy-acetic acid ) , an inhibitor of volume-sensitive chloride channels ( ClC ) , slightly potentiated nitroprusside vasorelaxation ( by 15 % ) , and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) chloride channel inhibitors P13569 (inh)172 ( 5-[(4-Carboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-3- [ (3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-4-thiazolidinone ) , DPC ( diphenylamine-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid ) and glibenclamide were without significant effect . In conclusion , inhibition of chloride transport proteins strongly potentiates the vasorelaxant responses to nitroprusside in isolated rat aorta . This effect seems mediated by chloride depletion and inhibition of a chloride channel activated by both , calcium and cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) .
