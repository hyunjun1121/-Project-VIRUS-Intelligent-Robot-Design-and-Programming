Lack of biological relevance of platelet cyclooxygenase-2 dependent thromboxane A2 production . INTRODUCTION : There is emerging evidence of a considerable variability of the impact of aspirin on clinical outcome and laboratory findings . Persistent TxA2 production seems to be the most likely reason . Aim of this study was to determine whether the mechanism responsible for TxA2 persistent production is , at least partially , dependent upon aspirin-insensitive platelet P35354 enzymatic pathway . METHODS AND RESULTS : In 100 consecutive patients , under chronic aspirin anti-platelet treatment ( 100-160 mg/day ) selected on the basis of detectable plasma salicylate levels , serum and DB04557 ( AA ) -induced platelet TxA2 production , immunoblot analysis of platelet P23219 / P35354 expression and P35354 activity were studied . Immunoblot revealed P35354 expression in 46 % patients , in an amount that was markedly lower than P23219 . In 10 P35354 positive patients with TxA2 levels over the median , AA-induced TxA2 production performed in vitro in the presence of the P35354 inhibitor CAY10404 and aspirin demonstrated that P35354 dependent TxA2 production is less than 2 % . CONCLUSION : Our data demonstrate that the inter-individual variability of platelet sensitivity to aspirin is due to a reduced efficacy of aspirin on platelet P23219 despite ascertained patient compliance . We suggest that serum TxA2 assay might be performed in future clinical studies to improve our knowledge on the residual TxA2 production in aspirin-treated patients .
