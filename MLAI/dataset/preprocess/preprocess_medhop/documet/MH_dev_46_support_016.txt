Reduced levels of P12830 correlate with progression of corticotroph pituitary tumours . OBJECTIVES : Loss of P12830 is an important marker of epithelial tumour progression . The aims of this study were to explore whether P12830 expression and localization correlate to corticotroph tumour progression , relate the expression of the P12830 gene ( CDH1 ) to immunohistochemical P12830 staining pattern , and study whether the P12830 levels were correlated to methylation status of the CDH1 promoter region . DESIGN : Immunohistochemical analyses of P12830 protein were performed , as was RT-qPCR of the CDH1 and the P01189 genes . Methylation pattern of the promoter region of CDH1 was measured using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA . PATIENTS : Forty-five patients operated at a tertiary referral centre in Oslo , Norway . Adenoma tissue sections and RNA samples from patients with verified Cushing 's disease or Nelson 's syndrome were collected . MEASUREMENTS : Expression of P12830 mRNA and protein in pituitary corticotroph adenomas and average percentage of methylated cytosines in a cytosine-phosphate-guanosine island of the CDH1 promoter . RESULTS : Correlations were observed between tumour progression and both nuclear expression of P12830 and reduced CDH1 mRNA . The P12830 expression was not determined by the methylation pattern of the CDH1 promoter . CONCLUSIONS : Corticotroph tumour progression was associated with reduced expression of the epithelial marker P12830 .
