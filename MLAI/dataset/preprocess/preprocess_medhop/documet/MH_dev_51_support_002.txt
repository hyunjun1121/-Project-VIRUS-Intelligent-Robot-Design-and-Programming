Loss of P38398 function increases the antitumor activity of cisplatin against human breast cancer xenografts in vivo . BACKGROUND : Previous reports suggested a central role of P38398 in DNA-damage repair mechanisms elicited by cell exposure to anti-tumor agents . Here we studied if P38398 -defective HCC1937 or P38398 -reconstituted HCC1937/(WT) P38398 human breast cancer xenografts ( HBCXs ) generated in SCID mice were differentially sensitive to cisplatin ( DB00515 ) in vivo and we investigated potential molecular correlates of this effect . RESULTS : DB00515 induced almost complete growth inhibition of P38398 -defective HBCXs , while P38398 -reconstituted HBCXs were only partially inhibited . Cell cycle analysis showed a significant S- and G(2)/M blockade in P38398 -defective as compared with parental P38398 -reconstituted cells . Comparative gene expression profiling of HCC1937 and HCC1937/(WT) P38398 showed upregulation of P43351 and Q13426 , whereas P07992 and P23921 were downregulated . Pathway finder analysis of gene arrays data indicated perturbations of major proliferation and survival pathways suggesting that P38398 is mostly involved in G(2)/M but also in G(1)/S-phase checkpoints as well as in several important signaling pathways , including IGF , P15692 , estrogen receptor , PI3K/AKT and P01133 . METHODS : HCC1937 or HCC1937/(WT) P38398 HBCXs were generated in SCID mice . Animals were then weekly treated with 5 mg/kg DB00515 i.p. or with vehicle for 4 w . Tumor volume and mice survival were evaluated . Tumors were retrieved from animals 12 hours after the last treatment with DB00515 or vehicle treatment and the cell suspension underwent cell cycle analysis . Differential gene expression and pathway modulation between HCC1937 and HCC1937/(WT) P38398 cells were also studied . CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that P38398 -defective in vivo HBCXs express a molecular scenario predictive of high sensitivity to platinum-derived compounds strongly supporting the rationale for prospective tailored clinical trials in hereditary breast cancer .
