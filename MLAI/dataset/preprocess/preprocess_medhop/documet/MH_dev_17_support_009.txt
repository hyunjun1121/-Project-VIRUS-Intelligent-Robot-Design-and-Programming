DB01093 -treated HL60 cells : a model of neutrophil-like cells mainly expressing Q07343 subtype . The human promyelocytic HL60 cells acquired a neutrophilic phenotype after a 7- to 10-day DB01093 treatment . Fc gammaRII was up-regulated . Fc gammaRI was also up-regulated by an additional P01579 treatment . These cells are able to produce O2*- by NADPH oxidase activation in the presence of immune complexes or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) . A change of their DB05876 subtype profile was also observed : Q07343 was the predominant isoenzyme , Q08499 was down-regulated and P27815 was no longer detectable . Additionally , the more NADPH oxidase was activated by PMA , the less P27815 was expressed , suggesting that NADPH oxidase activity could be used as a surrogate marker of P27815 down-regulation . DB01954 and DB03849 ( cilomilast ) , two selective DB05876 inhibitors , dose-dependently inhibited receptor-coupled activation of superoxide . These results suggest that Q07343 is the main subtype involved in regulating superoxide induced by Fc gammaRs activation . Furthermore , these cells , expressing almost exclusively Q07343 subtype , could be useful to identify selective Q07343 inhibitors .
