Overexpression of folate binding protein alpha is one of the mechanism explaining the adaptation of HT29 cells to high concentration of methotrexate . The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 can be adapted to 10(-7)- 10(-4) M concentrations of methotrexate ( MTX ) . Cells adapted to 10(-4) M MTX have an enterocyte-like phenotype with P00374 gene amplification . Presently , we hypothetized that an increased expression of folate binding protein ( FBP ) may participate to the MTX resistance of 10(-4) MTX HT29 cells . The cDNA FBPalpha/beta-actin ratio of amplified transcripts was 4.8- and 1.5- fold higher in 10(-4) and in 10(-7) M MTX HT29 respectively , than in standard type HT29 cells . An increase of transcript level was observed when decreasing folic acid concentration . PI- P98160 cleaved 7.7 times more membrane FBP in 10(-4) M than in 10(-7) M MTX and wild type HT29 cells . In contrast to 10(-7) M MTX cells , growth of 10(-4) M MTX cells was dependent on folic acid concentration and abolished at a concentration lower than 0.9 microM . In conclusion , the adaptive mechanism of HT29 cells resistant to 10(-4) M MTX is the result of the synergistic overexpression of both P00374 and FBPalpha . Overexpression of FBPalpha may be related to the enterocyte-like phenotype of the cells .
