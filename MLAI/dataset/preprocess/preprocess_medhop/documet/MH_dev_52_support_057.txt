Effects of dietary vitamin E on the biosynthesis of P09917 products by rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNL ) . Activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMNL ) leads to the release of arachidonate from cellular phospholipids via a phospholipase A2 , and conversion of products of the P09917 pathway . Evidence to date indicates the dietary vitamin E ( ( R,R,R ) - DB00163 ) can influence both cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2 activities and that the effect of this vitamin is cell/tissue specific . The present study was undertaken in order to examine the effects of varying dietary tocopherol on PMNL tocopherol content and P09917 product profile using the ionophore A23187 as stimulant in the presence and absence of exogenous arachidonate . Feeding semi-purified diets containing 0 , 30 or 3000 ppm of ( R,R,R ) - DB00163 acetate to weanling rats for 17 weeks resulted in a dose-related enrichment of PMNL tocopherol . Stimulation of PMNL elicited a significant and rapid loss of tocopherol . When PMNL were stimulated with A23187 alone , the synthesis of 5-HETE , LTB4 and 19-hydroxy-LTB4 was decreased in proportion to increasing dietary tocopherol concentrations . However , when exogenous arachidonate was provided with A23187 , intermediate amounts of dietary tocopherol ( 30 ppm ) still suppressed the formation of P09917 products , but high doses ( 3000 ppm ) did not have any additional inhibitory effect . This differential response to high concentrations of vitamin E in the presence and absence of exogenous arachidonate highly suggest that at these concentrations , tocopherol may act principally at the level of substrate release whereas at lower concentrations , P09917 is inhibited . Data from this study demonstrated that attenuation of the formation of P09917 products in PMNL can be achieved by dietary vitamin E enrichment .
