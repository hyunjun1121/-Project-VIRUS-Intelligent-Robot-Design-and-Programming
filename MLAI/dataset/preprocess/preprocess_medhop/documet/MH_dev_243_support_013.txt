P0DMS8 is a critical mediator in LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation . DB00640 receptor A(3) ( A(3) ) regulates directed movement of polymorphonuclear cells ( PMNs ) to sites of inflammation and has been implicated as a relevant mediator in models of inflammatory diseases . Here , we sought to characterize the role of A(3) in a murine model of lung inflammation . Initial studies revealed that pulmonary A(3) transcript levels were elevated following LPS exposure in vivo . In addition , inhalation of LPS increased the accumulation of PMNs in wild-type and A(3)(-/-) mice in all lung compartments . Pretreatment with the specific A(3)-agonist Cl- DB05511 significantly decreased migration of PMNs into lung interstitium and alveolar air space of wild-type mice but not of A(3)(-/-) mice . Lower PMN counts were associated with reduced levels of P01375 -Î± and P05231 in the alveolar space of wild-type mice that received Cl- DB05511 . In addition , Cl- DB05511 attenuated LPS-induced microvascular permeability in wild-type mice as assessed by the extravasation of Evans blue . In pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells , Cl- DB05511 reduced LPS-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and cell retraction , consistent with a specific role of A(3) for maintaining endothelial integrity . Migratory activity of human PMNs across an endothelial or epithelial monolayer was reduced when A(3) was activated on PMNs . Studies in chimeric mice , however , revealed that Cl- DB05511 required A(3) on both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells to reduce transmigration in vivo . Together , our results shed new light on the role of A(3) in LPS-induced PMN trafficking in the lung and suggest pharmacological modulation of A(3)-dependent pathways as a promising approach in lung inflammation .
