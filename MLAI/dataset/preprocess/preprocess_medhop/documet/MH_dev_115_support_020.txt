P08246 inhibitors as treatment for P48444 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , characterised by a slowly progressive , irreversible airways limitation , is a major worldwide cause of chronic morbidity and mortality . The imbalance between human neutrophil elastase and endogenous antiproteases may cause excess human neutrophil elastase in pulmonary tissues , which may be considered a major pathogenic factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Great effort has been devoted to finding a method to restore the balance , resulting in the discovery of potent two-typed small-molecular-weight human neutrophil elastase inhibitors . In the application of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy , the human neutrophil elastase inhibitors mainly focused upon include ONO-5046 , MR-889 , L-694,458 , CE-1037 , GW-311616 and TEI-8362 as the acyl-enzyme inhibitors ; and DB03925 , AE-3763 , FK-706 , ICI-200,880 , ZD-0892 and ZD-8321 as the transition-state inhibitors . In this review , various problems that remain to be solved in the clinical use of human neutrophil elastase inhibitors are discussed .
