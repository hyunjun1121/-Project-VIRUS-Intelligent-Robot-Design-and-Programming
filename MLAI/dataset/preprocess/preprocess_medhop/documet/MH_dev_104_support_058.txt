Non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics . 6 . Derivatives of 2-[3-[2-(4,5-Diphenyl-2-oxazolyl)ethyl]phenoxy]acetic acid modified beta-to the oxazole ring . 2-[3-[2-(4,5-Diphenyl-2-oxazolyl)ethyl]phenoxy]acetic acid , 1 , has been described as a non-prostanoid DB01240 mimetic that demonstrates anti-thrombotic properties of long duration in animal models of thrombosis . The effects of substitution and modification of the carbon beta-to the oxazole heterocycle of 1 were examined and equated with the potency of the compounds as inhibitors of ADP-induced human platelet aggregation in vitro . Potency was sensitive to both the size of the substituent and the identity of the beta-atom . The carbamates 13c-e demonstrated IC50 's of 0.28-0.36 microM and were significantly more potent than the progenitor 1 , IC50 = 1.2 microM . The ethyl carbamate 13c displaced [ 3H ] -iloprost from platelet membranes in a concentration-dependent fashion that was half maximal at 20 nM , which compares with IC50 's of 171 nM for 1 and 39 nM or unlabelled iloprost . Carbamate 13c stimulated platelet adenylate cyclase but the maximal effect was less than that observed for DB01240 , identifying 13c as a partial agonist at the platelet P43119 .
