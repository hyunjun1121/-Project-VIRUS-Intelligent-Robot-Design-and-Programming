Antibody-mediated neuronal cell signaling in behavior and movement disorders . Behavioral and movement disorders may have antibody responses where mimicry and signal transduction may lead to neuropsychiatric abnormalities . In our study , antibodies in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci ( PANDAS ) reacted with the neuronal cell surface and caudate-putamen and induced calcium-calmodulin dependent protein ( P62158 ) kinase II activity in neuronal cells . Depletion of serum IgG abrogated P62158 kinase II cell signaling and reactivity of P04141 was blocked by streptococcal antigen N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosamine ( GlcNAc ) . Antibodies against GlcNAc in PANDAS sera were inhibited by lysoganglioside G(M1) . Results suggest that antibodies from an infection may signal neuronal cells in some behavioral and movement disorders .
