Searching for a marker for Alzheimer 's disease- P02649 . The authors present their study of 10 patients affected by Alzheimer 's disease and 10 patients with multinfarctual dementia , who are already part of a P21554 study , senile dementia project , longitudinal study . The method adopted was that of DNA crossbreeding and amplification , so as to have a precise individualisation of alleles APo-E , Apo E-3 , Apo E-4 and of their various phenotype combinations . These isoforms are evaluated and compared with the disease studied , in order to help to identify a timely-marker for senile dementia . On the results obtained we hypothesised an association between Apo E-4 and the disease of about 40 % for Alzheimer 's disease , which leads us to increase our number of cases , regarding associations between demential diseases either Alzheimer or vascular and the presence of Apo E-4 .
