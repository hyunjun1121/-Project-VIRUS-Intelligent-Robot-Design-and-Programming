[ DB00091 inhibits the adhesion of neutrophil with ECV-304 induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation via ROS- P62937 - P27361 /2 pathway ] . To investigate the inhibition of cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) on neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs , ECV-304 ) induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation and further explore its mechanism , a 1 h hypoxia/4 h reoxygenation model was reproduced using ECV-304 . The adhesion rate of neutrophils to ECV-304 was determined by measuring the activity of endogenous hexosaminidase . The expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules of P16581 and P05362 was measured by flow cytometry . The expression of cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) and the activation of P27361 /2 was compared among experimental groups by Western blot . The content of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was measured by Fenton reaction . After being stimulated with 1 h hypoxia/4 h reoxygenation , ECV-304 showed an enhanced neutrophil adhensiveness in association with an increased surface expression of P16581 and P05362 . In parallel , the content of ROS was also increased . These effects were significantly suppressed by the addition of DB00091 . Most importantly , the expression of CyPA was significantly increased following 1 h hypoxia/4 h reoxygenation , which was accompanied with an increased activation of P27361 /2 . Treatment with CyPA inhibitor DB00091 and CyPA antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited the activation of P27361 /2 and decreased the adhesion of neutrophils to ECV-304 . The specific P27361 /2 inhibitor PD98059 caused an inhibition of neutrophil adhesion to hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated ECV-304 . Our data confirm that DB00091 inhibits neutrophil adhesion to hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulated ECV-304 by a mechanism involving inhibition of the signal transduction of ROS , CyPA and P27361 /2 .
