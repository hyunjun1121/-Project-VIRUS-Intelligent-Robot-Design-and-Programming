Clinical utility of the oral JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Immune/inflammatory cells act in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) -affected patients by synthesizing several inflammatory mediators , including cytokines that initiate intracellular signaling . Recently , small molecule inhibitors of transduction and transcription signals that influence the intracellular pathways ( such as the Janus kinase [ JAK ] family of tyrosine kinases ) have been tested for RA treatment . Four members of the JAK family are known : P23458 , O60674 , P52333 , and TyK2 . P23458 / P52333 constitutively binds to the cytoplasmic portion of the cytokine receptor - the common gamma chain - that represents a common subunit of several cytokines involved in T-cell and natural killer cell development , as well as in B-cell activation . DB08895 is an oral JAK inhibitor that is now available and effective in RA treatment , as shown in multiple Phase II and Phase III clinical trials . However , long-term safety data and comparisons with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and small molecule inhibitors are necessary to better determine the role of tofacitinib in RA .
