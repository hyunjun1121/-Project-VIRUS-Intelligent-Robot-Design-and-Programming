Critical role of Q08499 in beta2-adrenoceptor-dependent DB02527 signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts . One of the defining properties of beta2-adrenergic receptor ( beta(2)AR ) signaling is the transient and rapidly reversed accumulation of DB02527 . Here we have investigated the contribution of different DB05876 proteins to the generation of this transient response . To this aim , mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in P27815 , Q07343 , or Q08499 were generated , and the regulation of PDE activity , the accumulation of DB02527 , and CREB phosphorylation in response to isoproterenol were monitored . Ablation of Q08499 , but not P27815 or Q07343 , had a major effect on the beta-agonist-induced PDE activation , with only a minimal increase in PDE activity being retained in Q08499 knock-out ( KO ) cells . Accumulation of DB02527 was markedly enhanced , and the kinetics of DB02527 accumulation were altered in their properties in PDE4DKO but not PDE4BKO cells . Modest effects were observed in PDE4AKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts . The return to basal levels of both DB02527 accumulation and CREB phosphorylation was greatly delayed in the PDE4DKO cells , suggesting that Q08499 is critical for dissipation of the beta2AR stimulus . This effect of Q08499 ablation was in large part due to inactivation of a negative feedback mechanism consisting of the PKA-mediated activation of Q08499 in response to elevated DB02527 levels , as indicated by experiments using the DB02527 -dependent protein kinase inhibitors H89 and PKI . Finally , Q08499 ablation affected the kinetics of beta2AR desensitization as well as the interaction of the receptor with Galphai . These findings demonstrate that Q08499 plays a major role in shaping the beta2AR signal .
