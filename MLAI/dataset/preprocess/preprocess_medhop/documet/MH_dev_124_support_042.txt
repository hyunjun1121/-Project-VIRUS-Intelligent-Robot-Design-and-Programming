Evidence that ceramide mediates the ability of tumor necrosis factor to modulate primitive human hematopoietic cell fates . In this study , it is shown that short-term exposure of normal human marrow P28906 (+) P28907 (-) cells to low concentrations of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) in the presence of 100 ng/mL P49771 and Steel factor and 20 ng/mL interleukin-3 ( P08700 ) , P05231 , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , in either bulk or single-cell serum-free cultures , markedly reduces their ability subsequently to generate colony-forming cells ( CFCs ) in 6-week stromal cell-containing long-term cultures without affecting their viability , mitogenic response , or short-term ability to produce CFCs . A similar differential effect on the functional attributes of P28906 (+) P28907 (-) cells was seen when P06681 - or P13671 -ceramide , but not dihydro- P06681 -ceramide ( an inactive analog of ceramide ) , was substituted for P01375 . The addition of D-erythro-MAPP ( a specific inhibitor of intracellular ceramide degradation ) enhanced the ability of P01375 to selectively eliminate long-term culture-initiating cell ( LTC-IC ) activity . These findings indicate that P01375 can directly modulate the ability of P28906 (+) P28907 (-) cells to maintain their LTC-IC function at doses below those required to initiate apoptosis , cell cycle arrest , or both , and they suggest that this may be mediated by the P01375 -induced generation of intracellular ceramide . Identification of a signaling intermediate that can influence primitive hematopoietic cell fate decisions offers a new approach to the investigation of signaling mechanisms in normal stem cell populations and to how these may be altered in leukemic cells .
