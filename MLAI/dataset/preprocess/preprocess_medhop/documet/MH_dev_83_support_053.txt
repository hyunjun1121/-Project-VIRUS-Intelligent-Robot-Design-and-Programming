Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor during and after radiotherapy in combination with celecoxib in patients with advanced head and neck cancer . DB00482 and radiotherapy in advanced head and neck cancer . This phase I dose-escalation study seeks to determine the phase II recommended dose of cyclooxygenase type 2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor in patients with locally advanced squamous cell head and neck ( H & N ) cancer , treated with accelerated radiotherapy . Anti-vasculogenic effect of this treatment on serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is examined . Patients were irradiated with curative intent ( 72Gy in 6weeks ) . Celecoxib was administered throughout the radiotherapy course . Serum P15692 level were tested during radiotherapy and in follow-up . Tumor specimens were stained to quantify the P35354 expression . Thirty-two patients completed the treatment . The dose of celecoxib was escalated ( 200 , 400 and 800mg bid , then de-escalated to 600mg bid ) . The acute toxicity related to the treatment in the first and second cohort did not reach grade III ; in the third cohort three patients had grade III radiation toxicity and one had celecoxib-related toxicity . In the last fourth cohort the toxicity was acceptable . Significant P15692 level drop ( p=0.011 ) was found between radiation day 1 and post-treatment visit . Significant decrease ( p=0.022 ) of the P15692 level was shown in patients with high P35354 expression in the tumor . Phase II recommended dose of celecoxib combined with accelerated radiotherapy in advanced H & N cancer was 600mg bid . A significant decrease of the post-treatment serum P15692 level compared to the initial level was noticed only in patients with high P35354 expression in tumors .
