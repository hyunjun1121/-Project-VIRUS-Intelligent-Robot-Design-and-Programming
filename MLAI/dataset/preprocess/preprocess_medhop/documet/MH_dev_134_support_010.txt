Anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze tests and enhanced IL-1β , P05231 , NADPH oxidase-1 , and P35228 mRNAs in the hippocampus during early stage of adjuvant arthritis in rats . We studied anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze ( EPM ) tests in male Lewis rats on days 2 and 4 of adjuvant arthritis ( AA ) . In plasma we analyzed P02741 ( CRP ) , albumin , DB01285 , corticosterone , in the hippocampus the mRNA expression of interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , corticotrophin releasing factor ( P06850 ) , NADPH oxidases Q9Y5S8 and P04839 , and inducible NO-synthase ( P35228 ) . EPM tests showed a higher anxiety index in AA rats on days 2 and 4 and reduction of total entries . On days 2 and 4 we found reduced plasma albumin , enhanced CRP , DB01285 and corticosterone , and in the hippocampus enhanced mRNA for Q9Y5S8 and IL-1β in AA rats , on day 4 we found enhanced mRNAs for P35228 and P05231 , and reduced mRNA for P06850 . The mRNA for P04839 did not change on any experimental day . These results suggest enhanced anxiety , as well as locomotor impairment during the early phase of AA that correlate with enhanced mRNA expressions of parameters of oxidative stress Q9Y5S8 , P35228 , and inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and P05231 in the hippocampus .
