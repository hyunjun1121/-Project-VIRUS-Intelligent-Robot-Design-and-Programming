DB01283 ( DB01283 ) : a new selective P35354 inhibitor . DB01283 , a new selective P35354 inhibitor , has been recently approved in England and Mexico for the treatment of acute and chronic pain . Although it is the fifth P35354 inhibitor to come to the market , it has a unique structure that could prove to be important in the adverse event profile . Double blind randomised trials have proved its efficacy in acute pain , dysmenorrhea , rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis . Its gastrointestinal safety profile has been studied in multiple trials . The main clinical trail , therapeutic arthritis research and gastrointestinal event trial , has as primary end point : perforations , obstructions and bleeding and as secondary end points : cardiovascular , renal and hepatic safety profile . The results of this trial will probably change the way we look at selective P35354 inhibitors .
