P00797 inhibition with aliskiren . 1. Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties . Molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors , such as aliskiren . 2 . DB09026 has a low bioavailability ( between 2.6 and 5.0 % ) compensated by its high potency to inhibit renin ( IC50 : 0.6 nmol/L ) and a long plasma half-life ( 23-36 h ) , which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing . 3 . The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers BP as strongly as standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor blockers ( losartan , valsartan , irbesartan ) , hydrochlorothiazide , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ramipril and lisinopril ) or long acting calcium channel blockers ( amlodipine ) . In combination therapy , aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide , amlodipine , irbesartan or ramipril . 4 . The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibition and Ang II antagonism , particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway and possibly the (pro)renin receptor . 5 . Blockade of the renin angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) with P12821 inhibitors , AT1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine . However , it remains unclear how to optimize DB01367 blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits . In this context , renin inhibition to render the DB01367 fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study .
