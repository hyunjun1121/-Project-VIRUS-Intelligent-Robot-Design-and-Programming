Clinical development of eniluracil : current status . DB03516 is a potent inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( Q12882 ) , which is the first enzyme in the degradative pathway of systemically administered 5-fluorouracil ( DB00544 ) . Two completely oral regimens of eniluracil plus DB00544 are being evaluated in clinical trials : ( 1 ) a chronic schedule with both agents administered P55957 in a 10:1 ratio for 28 days of a 5-week course , and ( 2 ) a 5-day schedule of eniluracil once daily on days 1 through 7 and DB00544 once daily on days 2 through 6 . The clinical development of eniluracil is being pursued in several tumor types , including colorectal cancer , breast cancer , and pancreatic cancer . Response rates achieved in a phase II study of the chronic schedule of oral eniluracil/ DB00544 in patients with colorectal cancer compare favorably with those obtained in trials of intravenous DB00544 and leucovorin , while results from other trials are awaited . Safety analysis for the 28-day schedule has revealed a low incidence of severe toxicities , particularly as compared with standard DB00544 regimens .
