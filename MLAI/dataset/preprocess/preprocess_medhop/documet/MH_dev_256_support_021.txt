Proapoptotic and antiproliferative potential of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in human liver tumor cells . Recent studies have shown increased levels of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in a variety of human malignancies , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , but so far it is unknown whether P35354 contributes to the malignant growth and whether inhibition of P35354 function modifies the malignant potential of liver tumors . P23219 and P35354 expression was determined in 4 liver tumor cell lines ( Hep 3B , HuH-7 , Hep G2 , Sk-hep1 ) by Northern hybridization and Western immunoblot . The functional effects of the nonselective inhibitor sulindac sulfide and the P35354 selective inhibitors SC-58635 and meloxicam were examined by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide ( MTT ) -assays and BrdU uptake , morphology , and TUNEL analysis of apoptosis . Apoptosis regulating proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblot . P23219 and P35354 expression was demonstrable in all tested liver tumor cell lines . Sulindac sulfide ( 50 to 400 micromol/L ) , SC-58635 ( 6,25 to 400 micromol/L ) , and meloxicam ( 6.25 to 400 micromol/L ) led to a significant time- and dose-dependent reduction of cell numbers of up to 80 % ( P < .05 ) . At equimolar concentrations the effect was more pronounced when P35354 was selectively blocked . P35354 inhibition induced apoptosis and reduced tumor cell proliferation . Apoptosis after P35354 inhibition with SC-58635 ( 50 micromol/L ) was independent of BCL-2 , Q07812 , and the phosphorylation status of AKT/ P31749 and Q92934 , but correlated with activation of caspase-9 , caspase-3 , and caspase-6 . In conclusion , selective inhibition of P35354 leads to a marked growth inhibition of human liver tumor cells , based on the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and , thus , may offer therapeutic and preventive potential in human hepatocarcinogenesis .
