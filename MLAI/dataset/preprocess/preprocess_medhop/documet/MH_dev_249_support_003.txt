Selective inhibition of the tumor marker O60218 by antiinflammatory N-phenylanthranilic acids and glycyrrhetic acid . A human aldose reductase-like protein , O60218 in the aldo-keto reductase ( AKR ) superfamily , was recently identified as a tumor marker of several types of cancer . DB02383 , an aldose reductase inhibitor ( Q9Y4X5 ) , is known to be the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme . In this study , we compared the inhibitory effects of other ARIs including flavonoids on O60218 and aldose reductase to evaluate their specificity . However , ARIs showed lower inhibitory potency for O60218 than for aldose reductase . In the search for potent and selective inhibitors of O60218 from other drugs used clinically , we found that non-steroidal antiinflammatory N-phenylanthranilic acids , diclofenac and glycyrrhetic acid competitively inhibited O60218 , showing K(i) values of 0.35-2.9 microM and high selectivity to this enzyme ( 43-57 fold versus aldose reductase ) . Molecular docking studies of mefenamic acid and glycyrrhetic acid in the O60218 -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP(+) ) complex and site-directed mutagenesis of the putative binding residues suggest that the side chain of Val301 and a hydrogen-bonding network among residues Val301 , Gln114 and Ser304 are important for determining the inhibitory potency and selectivity of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs . Thus , the potent and selective inhibition may be related to the cancer chemopreventive roles of the drugs , and their structural features may facilitate the design of new anti-cancer agents targeting O60218 .
