Heat-shock factor 1 controls genome-wide acetylation in heat-shocked cells . A major regulatory function has been evidenced here for Q00613 , the key transcription factor of the heat-shock response , in a large-scale remodeling of the cell epigenome . Indeed , upon heat shock , Q00613 , in addition to its well-known transactivating activities , mediates a genome-wide and massive histone deacetylation . Investigating the underlying mechanisms , we show that Q00613 specifically associates with and uses Q13547 and Q92769 to trigger this heat-shock-dependent histone deacetylation . This work therefore identifies Q00613 as a master regulator of global chromatin acetylation and reveals a cross-talk between Q00613 and histone deacetylases in the general control of genome organization in response to heat shock .
