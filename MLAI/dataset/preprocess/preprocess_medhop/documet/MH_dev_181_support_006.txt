[ Roles of P26718 in cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) against hematological malignant cells lines ] . This study was purposed to investigate the CIK cell cytotoxicity to hematological malignant cell lines by interaction P26718 receptors and corresponding ligands . The CIK cells was expanded from healthy individual with interferon (IFN)γ , CD3 monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) and interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) . The subset of lymphocyte and the expression of NK cell receptors on CIK cells was detected by flow cytometry ; P26718 ligand expression on hematological malignant cell lines was also analyzed by flow cytometry , the calcein acetoxymethyl ester ( P62158 ) was used for labeling target cells , then the cytotoxicity of CIK cells to hematological malignant cell lines was detected by flow cytometry . The results showed that most of CIK cells expressed CD3 ( 97.85 ± 1.95 % ) , CD3(+)CD8(+) cells and CD3(+)CD56(+) cells increased significantly as compared with un-cultured cells ( P < 0.001;P = 0.033 ) . About 86 % CIK cells expressed P26718 receptor but no other NK receptors such as CD158a , CD158b and NCR . Different levels of P26718 ligands were detected in hematological malignant cell lines U266 , K562 and Daudi . CIK cells showed high cytotoxicity to these three different cell lines , and this cytotoxicity was partially blocked by treating CIK cells with anti- P26718 antibody ( U266 52.67 ± 4.63 % vs 32.67 ± 4.81 % , P = 0.008;K562 71.67 ± 4.91 % vs 50.33 ± 4.91 % , P = 0.007;Daudi 68.67 ± 5.04 vs 52.67 ± 2.60 % , P = 0.024 ) . It is concluded that most of CIK cells express P26718 receptor , interaction of P26718 - P26718 ligands may be one of the mechanisms , by which CIK cells kill hematological malignant cells .
