The kinetic and physical basis of K( DB00171 ) channel gating : toward a unified molecular understanding . K( DB00171 ) channels can be formed from Kir6.2 subunits with or without Q09428 . The open-state stability of K( DB00171 ) channels can be increased or reduced by mutations throughout the Kir6.2 subunit , and is increased by application of PIP(2) to the cytoplasmic membrane . Increase of open-state stability is manifested as an increase in the channel open probability in the absence of DB00171 ( Po(zero) ) and a correlated decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by DB00171 . Single channel lifetime analyses were performed on wild-type and I154C mutant channels expressed with , and without , Q09428 . Channel kinetics include a single , invariant , open duration ; an invariant , brief , closed duration ; and longer closed events consisting of a " mixture of exponentials , " which are prolonged in DB00171 and shortened after PIP(2) treatment . The steady-state and kinetic data can not be accounted for by assuming that DB00171 binds to the channel and causes a gate to close . Rather , we show that they can be explained by models that assume the following regarding the gating behavior : 1 ) the channel undergoes DB00171 -insensitive transitions from the open state to a short closed state ( C(f) ) and to a longer-lived closed state ( C(0) ) ; 2 ) the C(0) state is destabilized in the presence of Q09428 ; and 3 ) DB00171 can access this C(0) state , stabilizing it and thereby inhibiting macroscopic currents . The effect of PIP(2) and mutations that stabilize the open state is then to shift the equilibrium of the " critical transition " from the open state to the DB00171 -accessible C(0) state toward the O state , reducing accessibility of the C(0) state , and hence reducing DB00171 sensitivity .
