Increased expression of nucleophosmin/B23 in hepatocellular carcinoma and correlation with clinicopathological parameters . P06748 ( P06748 , B23 , numatrin , NO38 ) is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in multiple cellular functions . Previous evidence indicates that high-level expression of P06748 causes uncontrolled cell growth and suggests that P06748 may have oncogenic potential . In this study , we examined P06748 expression in 103 paired cases of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , 12 cases of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia , 17 cases of liver tissue adjacent to a hepatic haemangioma , and series of array tissues from normal human organs and malignancies using a monoclonal antibody against P06748 and reverse transcription-PCR techniques , Western blot analysis , immunohistochemistry , and immunocytofluorescence . Our data indicated that P06748 expression was significantly higher in HCC than in the non-malignant hepatocytes ( P < 0.001 ) . P06748 was weakly expressed in hepatocytes from a 5-month-old embryo and in stationary hepatocytes of healthy adults . Moreover , enhanced expression of P06748 in HCC correlated with the level of P12004 ( R(2)=0.5639 ) and with the clinical prognostic parameters such as serum alpha fetal protein level , tumour pathological grading , and liver cirrhosis ( P < 0.05 ) . Our results suggest that P06748 may play an important role in the progression of tumorigenesis and that P06748 may serve as a potential marker for HCC .
