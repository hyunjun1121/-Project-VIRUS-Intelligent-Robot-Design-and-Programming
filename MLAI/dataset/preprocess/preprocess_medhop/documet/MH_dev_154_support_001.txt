Growth associated proteins in tumor cells and stroma related to disease progression of colon cancer accounting for tumor tissue DB00917 content . Connections among specific proteins ( Bax , Bcl-2 , P09038 , P23219 , P35354 , E-cad , p15 , p53 , P12004 , TGFbeta3 , TUNEL , P04275 ) in control of cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell adhesion , tumor vascularity and DB00917 content were evaluated in colon cancer as related to disease progression and survival . Tumor tissue and adjacent normal colon mucosa were obtained at curative resection in 22 patients . DB00917 concentrations were assessed in tumor tissue and tumor derived blood , splanchnic blood , peripheral venous blood and urine . Host inflammation was determined ( CRP , P03372 ) in relationship to tumor differentiation and stage . Patients survived as expected according to Dukes A-D staging . Growth-related proteins correlated between tumor cells and stroma as well as between protein factors within tumor cells and tumor stroma . P35354 predicted tumor tissue content of DB00917 ( p < 0.002 ) , without reflection in tumor derived blood . Systemic inflammation was predicted by p15 , TGFbeta3 and Bcl-2 in tumor tissue ( p < 0.001 ) . p15 and P04275 predicted reduced survival in ungrouped patients ( p < 0.02 ) , while p15 , P12004 , TGFbeta3 and P04275 predicted reduced survival ( p < 0.0001 ) when patient grouping accounted for high tumor content of DB00917 . Our results connect systemic inflammation and survival to P35354 staining and increased DB00917 in colon cancer . Thus , it seems important to understand proximal signals behind upregulation of P35354 and subsequent DB00917 production in certain tumor cells in colon cancer .
