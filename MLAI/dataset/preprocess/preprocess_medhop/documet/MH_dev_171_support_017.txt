Population pharmacokinetics of ethionamide in patients with tuberculosis . SETTING : Three US referral hospitals . OBJECTIVE : Determine the population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters of ethionamide ( P25101 ) following multiple oral doses . DESIGN : Fifty-five patients with tuberculosis ( TB ) participated . Patients received multiple oral doses of P25101 as part of their treatment . They also received other anti-tuberculosis medications based upon in vitro susceptibility data . Serum samples were collected over 12 h post-dose , and concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) assay . Concentration-time data were analyzed using population methods . RESULTS : P25101 areas under the concentration-versus-time curve ( AUCs ) increased linearly with increasing oral doses from 250 to 1000 mg . Compared to the population pattern , delayed absorption was seen at least once in 15 % of patients . P25101 PK parameter estimates were independent of age , weight , height , gender , and creatinine clearance . TB patients appeared to have larger volumes of distribution ( 3.22 l/kg ) and clearance values ( 1.88 l/h/kg ) compared to previously studied healthy volunteers . This resulted in lower AUC values ( 3.95 mcg h/ml ) in the TB patients . P25101 displayed a short elimination half-life ( 1.94 h ) . The effect of different dosing strategies on calculated pharmacodynamic parameters was explored . Simulated doses of 250 mg P55957 to TID failed to achieve serum concentrations above the MIC . CONCLUSION : P25101 PK parameters differed between TB patients and healthy volunteers , possibly due to differences in the completeness of absorption . Doses of at least 500 mg appear to be required to achieve serum concentrations above the typical P25101 MIC . Additional research is needed to determine the optimal dosing of P25101 .
