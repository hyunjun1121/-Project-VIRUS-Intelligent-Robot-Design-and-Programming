Initial characterization of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit Gclm(-/-) knockout mouse . Novel model system for a severely compromised oxidative stress response . Glutamate-cysteine ligase ( GCL ) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the DB00143 biosynthesis pathway . In higher eukaryotes , this enzyme is a heterodimer comprising a catalytic subunit ( P48506 ) and a modifier subunit ( P48507 ) , which change the catalytic characteristics of the holoenzyme . To define the cellular function of P48507 , we disrupted the mouse Gclm gene to create a null allele . Gclm(-/-) mice are viable and fertile and have no overt phenotype . In liver , lung , pancreas , erythrocytes , and plasma , however , DB00143 levels in Gclm(-/-) mice were 9-16 % of that in Gclm(+/+) littermates . DB00151 levels in Gclm(-/-) mice were 9 , 35 , and 40 % of that in Gclm(+/+) mice in kidney , pancreas , and plasma , respectively , but remained unchanged in the liver and erythrocytes . Comparing the hepatic GCL holoenzyme with P48506 in the genetic absence of P48507 , we found the latter had an approximately 2-fold increase in K(m) for glutamate and a dramatically enhanced sensitivity to DB00143 inhibition . The major decrease in DB00143 , combined with diminished GCL activity , rendered Gclm(-/-) fetal fibroblasts strikingly more sensitive to chemical oxidants such as H(2)O(2) . We conclude that the Gclm(-/-) mouse represents a model of chronic DB00143 depletion that will be very useful in evaluating the role of the P48507 subunit and DB00143 in numerous pathophysiological conditions as well as in environmental toxicity associated with oxidant insult .
