Intracellular signaling pathways involved in the relaxin-induced proliferation of rat Sertoli cells . Regulation of Sertoli cell number is a key event to determine normal spermatogenesis . We have previously shown that relaxin and its G-protein coupled receptor Q9HBX9 are expressed in rat Sertoli cells , and that relaxin stimulates Sertoli cell proliferation . This study examined the mechanisms underlying the mitogenic effect of relaxin in a primary culture of Sertoli cells removed from testes of immature rats . Stimulation with exogenous relaxin increased Sertoli cell number and the expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) , but did not affect the mRNA level of the differentiation markers cadherins 1 and 2 . Relaxin-induced Sertoli cell proliferation was blocked by inhibition of MEK/ P27361 /2 or PI3K/AKT pathways , but not by inhibition of PKC or P00533 activity . Relaxin induced a rapid and transient activation of P27361 /2 phosphorylation , which was MEK and P12931 -dependent , and involved upstream activation of G(i) . AKT activation could be detected 5 min after relaxin stimulation , and was still detected after 24h of stimulation with relaxin . Relaxin-induced AKT phosphorylation was G(i)- but not PKA-dependent , and it was blocked by both PI3K and MEK inhibitors . In conclusion , the mitogenic effect of relaxin in Sertoli cell involves coupling to G(i) and activation of both MEK/ P27361 /2 and PI3K/AKT pathways .
