Inhibition of P29323 activation enhances the repair of double-stranded breaks via non-homologous end joining by increasing P78527 activation . Non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) is one of the major pathways that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks ( DSBs ) . Activation of DNA-PK is required for NHEJ . However , the mechanism leading to P78527 activation remains incompletely understood . We provide evidence here that the MEK- P29323 pathway plays a role in P78527 -mediated NHEJ . In comparison to the vehicle control ( DB01093 ) , etoposide ( ETOP ) -induced DSBs in MCF7 cells were more rapidly repaired in the presence of U0126 , a specific MEK inhibitor , based on the reduction of Î³ P16104 and tail moments . Additionally , U0126 increased reactivation of luciferase activity , which resulted from the repair of restriction enzyme-cleaved DSBs . Furthermore , while inhibition of P29323 activation using the dominant-negative MEK1K97M accelerated the repair of DSBs , enforcing P29323 activation with the constitutively active MEK1Q56P reduced DSB repair . In line with MEK activating P27361 and P28482 kinases , knockdown of either P27361 or P28482 increased DSB repair . Consistent with the activation of P78527 being required for NHEJ , we demonstrated that inhibition of P29323 activation using U0126 , MEK1K97M , and knockdown of P27361 or P28482 enhanced ETOP-induced activation of P78527 . Conversely , enforcing P29323 activation by MEK1Q56P reduced ETOP-initiated P78527 activation . Taken together , we demonstrate that P29323 reduces NHEJ-mediated repair of DSBs via attenuation of P78527 activation .
