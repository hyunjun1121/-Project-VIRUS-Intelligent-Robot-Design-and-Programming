Linkage mapping of highly informative DNA polymorphisms within the human interferon-alpha receptor gene on chromosome 21 . Two polymorphic loci within the interferon-alpha receptor ( P17181 ) gene on human chromosome 21 have been identified and mapped by linkage analysis in 40 CEPH families . These markers are ( 1 ) a multiallelic RFLP with an observed heterozygosity of 0.72 and ( 2 ) a variable ( P01008 )n short sequence repeat at the poly(A) tail of an Alu sequence ( AluVpA ) with an observed heterozygosity of 0.83 . This locus is close to Q08334 ( theta = 0.02 , zeta = 36.76 ) and D21S17 ( theta = 0.02 , Zeta = 21.76 ) with chromosomal band 21q22.1 . Multipoint linkage analysis suggests the most likely locus order to be 21cen- Q08334 - P17181 -D21S17-21qter . Given its high heterozygosity , the P17181 gene can be used as an index marker on human chromosome 21 .
