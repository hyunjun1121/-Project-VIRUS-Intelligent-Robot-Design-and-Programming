Nuclear factor kappa B inhibition improves conductance artery function in type 2 diabetic mice . BACKGROUND : We previously reported that enhanced nuclear factor kappa B ( NFκB ) activity is responsible for resistance arteries dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice . METHODS : In this study , we aimed to determine whether augmented NFκB activity also impairs conductance artery ( thoracic aorta ) function in type 2 diabetic mice . We treated type 2 diabetic ( db(-) /db(-) ) and control ( db(-) /db(+) ) mice with two NFκB inhibitors ( dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin , 6 mg/kg , twice a week and IKK-NBD peptide , 500 µg/kg/day ) for 4 weeks . RESULTS : As expected , the NFκB inhibition did not affect blood glucose level and body weight . Thoracic aorta vascular endothelium-dependent relaxation ( EDR ) , determined by the wire myograph , was impaired in diabetic mice compared with control and was significantly improved after NFκB inhibition . Interestingly , thoracic EDR was also rescued in db(-) /db(-p50NFκB-/-) and db(-) /db(- P09874 -/-) double knockout mice compared with db(-) /db(-) mice . Similarly , the acute in vitro down regulation of NFκB-p65 using p65 shRNA lentiviral particles in arteries from db(-) /db(-) mice also improved thoracic aorta EDR . Western blot analysis showed that the p65NFκB phosphorylation , cleaved P09874 and P35354 expression were increased in thoracic aorta from diabetic mice , which were restored after NFκB inhibition and in db(-) /db(-p-50NFκB-/-) and db(-) /db(- P09874 -/-) mice . CONCLUSIONS : The present results indicate that in male type 2 diabetic mice , the augmented NFκB activity also impairs conductance artery function through P09874 and P35354 -dependent mechanisms .
