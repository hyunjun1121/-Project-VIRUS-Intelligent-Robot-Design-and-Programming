Imatinib restores P50552 activity and its interaction with Q15942 in P11274 - P00519 leukemic cells . P50552 ( P50552 ) and Q15942 are interacting proteins involved in cellular adhesion and motility . PKA phosphorylates P50552 at serine 157 , regulating P50552 cellular functions . P50552 interacts with P00519 and is a substrate of the P11274 - P00519 oncoprotein . The presence of P11274 - P00519 protein drives oncogenesis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) due to a constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity . However , the function of P50552 and Q15942 in P11274 - P00519 pathway and the role of P50552 in CML cells remain unknown . In vitro experiments using K562 cells showed the involvement of P50552 in P11274 - P00519 signaling . P50552 and Q15942 inhibition decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins , P10415 and BCL-XL . Imatinib induced an increase in phosphorylation at Ser157 of P50552 and decreased P50552 and P11274 - P00519 interaction . P50552 did not interact with Q15942 in K562 cells ; however , after Imatinib treatment , this interaction was restored . Corroborating our data , we demonstrated the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in P50552 in the bone marrow of CML patients , in contrast to healthy donors . Phosphorylation of P50552 on Ser157 was restored in Imatinib responsive patients though not in the resistant patients . Therefore , we herein identified a possible role of P50552 in CML pathogenesis , through the regulation of P11274 - P00519 effector proteins or the absence of phosphorylation at Ser157 in P50552 .
