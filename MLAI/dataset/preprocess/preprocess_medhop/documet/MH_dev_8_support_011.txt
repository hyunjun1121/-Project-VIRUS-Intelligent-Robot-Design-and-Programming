DB08932 ( Opsumit ) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension . The endothelin pathway is a key pathway for the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Antagonism of this pathway is recommended as initial therapy in low-risk patient with PAH to inhibit fibrosis , cell proliferation , and inflammation caused by endothelin . Prior to October 2013 , ambrisentan , a selective P25101 receptor antagonist and DB00559 , a dual P25101 /ETB antagonist , were the only currently available agents for PAH targeting the endothelin pathway . Based on the results of the SERAPHIN trial , macitentan ( brand name OpsumitÂ® ) , a new P25101 /ETB antagonist , has been US FDA approved to delay disease progression and reduce hospitalizations for PAH . SERAPHIN is the first ERA trial to use an event-driven strategy with a composite primary end point of morbidity or mortality . Previous trials have focused on short-term outcomes , such as improved 6-min walk distance and WHO functional class .
