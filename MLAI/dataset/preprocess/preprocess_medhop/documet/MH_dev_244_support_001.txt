Hypothalamic regulation of the adenohypophyseal-testicular axis in the male chick embryo . An antibody against luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) as well as naloxone , an opioid antagonist , were added to the chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) of 11.5- and 14.5-day-old male chick embryos and plasma testosterone ( T ) concentrations were determined . This protocol was designed to demonstrate : ( 1 ) Whether P01148 is essential in the regulation of the adenohypophyseal-testicular axis in the male embryo and ( 2 ) if P01148 is operative in this unit 's function , are opiatergic pathways involved in the secretion of P01148 by the hypothalamus . Both anti- P01148 and naloxone lowered plasma T levels in 14.5-day-old embryos , but not 11.5-day-old embryos . This indicates that the hypothalamus , via P01148 , begins to regulate the pituitary-testicular unit at some time between Days 11.5 and 14.5 , i.e. , the hypothalamo-adenohypophyseal-testicular axis is established . The results also strongly suggest that the normal secretory pattern of P01148 is dependent upon opiatergic innervation of the hypothalamus at the same embryonic time .
