Changing paradigms in management of metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) . Recently , the standard of care for metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) has changed considerably . Persistent androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling has been identified as a target for novel therapies and reengages the fact that AR continues to be the primary target responsible for metastatic prostate cancer . P10275 gene amplification and over expression have been found to result in a higher concentration of androgen receptors on tumor cells , making them extremely sensitive to low levels of circulating androgens . Additionally , prostate cancer cells are able to maintain dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) concentration in excess of serum concentrations to support tumor growth . For many years ketoconazole was the only P05093 inhibitor that was used to treat mCRPC . However , significant toxicities limit its use . Newly approved chemotherapeutic agents such as DB05812 ( an oral selective inhibitor of CYP17A ) , which blocks androgen biosynthesis both within and outside the prostate cancer cells ) , and enzalutamide ( blocks AR signaling ) have improved overall survival . There are also ongoing phase III trials for Orteronel ( P50750 - 700 ) , ARN- 509 and Galeterone ( TOK-001 ) , which targets androgen signaling . In this review , we will present the rationale for the newly approved hormonal treatments , their indications and complications , and we will discuss ongoing trials that are being done to improve the efficacy of the approved agents . Finally , we will talk about the potential upcoming hormonal treatments for mCRPC .
