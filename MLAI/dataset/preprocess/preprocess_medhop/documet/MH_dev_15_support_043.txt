[ The role of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in pathogenesis of pancreatic pseudocysts ] . The investigation was conducted in 47 patients , operated on for pancreatic pseudocysts ( PP ) . Activity of matrix metalloproteinases ( P14780 ) and content of their tissue inhibitor ( P16035 ) were determined in the blood serum for estimation of inflammatory factors , hypoxia severity and state of the pancreatic tissue reconstruction . High activity of P14780 and P16035 in presence of PP types I and II was noted in patients , what , probably , is caused by compensation reaction , directed towards inhibition of the collagen system destruction ( predominantly of collagen type IV ) and prevention of further reconstruction of pancreatic connective tissue . While progressing of pancreatic fibrosis the P14780 activity and the P16035 level have lowered in comparison with these indices while its absence . In PP type III the P14780 activity was by 83.6 % higher , than in a control group , but , by 51.4 and 35.1 % lower , than in PP types I and IV . In all the patients endothelial dysfunction with endothelial injury was observed , witnessed by significant rising of the P15692 content in the blood serum . It have created favorable conditions for pancreatic tissue remodeling while parenchymal defect have been constituted by tissue , owing lower level of organization , including a cicatricial one . In cases of cellular repeated affection more activation of pancreatic stellate cells and enhancement of production of extracellular matrix component were noted .
