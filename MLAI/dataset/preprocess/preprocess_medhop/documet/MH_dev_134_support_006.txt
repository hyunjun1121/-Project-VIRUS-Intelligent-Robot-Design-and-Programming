Molecular and biologic characterization of a newly established Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line ( Z-33 ) with an autocrine response to GM- P04141 . We have recently established a new Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph1 ) -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cell line , designated Z-33 . This line has Q401N2 morphology , ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts and typical B lineage surface markers identical to those observed in the Ph1-positive ALL patient from whom the line was derived . In addition , a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene ( JH ) band was found in Z-33 cells by Southern blot analysis , confirming B cell clonality . Cytogenetic analysis of the cell line revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -amplified cDNA from Z-33 cells demonstrated an e1-az P11274 - P00519 junction , and the p190BCR- P00519 protein was detected in them by the immune complex kinase assay . Z-33 cells produce interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta , P05231 , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) , granulocyte-macrophage P04141 ( GM- P04141 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , Neither P01584 , DB00099 , P01375 , nor their corresponding antibodies affected the cell line 's growth . In contrast , anti-GM- P04141 neutralizing antibodies suppressed Z-33 colony formation , and GM- P04141 stimulated it in a dose-dependent fashion . In addition , receptor studies with biotinylated GM- P04141 demonstrated specific binding to Z-33 cells , indicating that the cells express GM- P04141 receptors . Taken together , our data suggest that the Ph1-positive Z-33 ALL cells produce GM- P04141 , express GM- P04141 receptors , and show an autocrine proliferative response to this cytokine .
