The steroid receptor co-activator-1 ( Q15788 ) potentiates TGF-beta/Smad signaling : role of p300/CBP . The three related 160-kDa proteins , Q15788 , Q06418 -2 and Q9Y6Q9 , were initially identified as factors interacting with nuclear receptors . They have also been reported to potentiate the activity of other transcription factors such as AP-1 or NF-kappaB . The aim of this work was to identify whether Q15788 interferes with the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway , and if so , to identify its underlying mechanisms of action . Using transient cell transfection experiments performed in human dermal fibroblasts with the P84022 /4-specific (SBE)4-lux reporter construct , as well as the human P05121 promoter , we determined that Q15788 enhances TGF-beta-induced , Smad-mediated , transcription . Likewise , Q15788 overexpression potentiated TGF-beta-induced upregulation of P05121 steady-state mRNA levels . Using a mammalian two-hybrid system , we demonstrated that Q15788 interacts with the transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP , but not with P84022 . Overexpression of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein , an inhibitor of CBP/p300 activity , prevented the enhancing effect of Q15788 on P84022 /4-mediated transcription , indicating that p300/CBP may be required for Q15788 effect . Such hypothesis was validated , as expression of a mutant form of Q15788 lacking the CBP/p300-binding site failed to upregulate P84022 /4-dependent transcription , while full-length Q15788 potentiated p300. P84022 interactions . These results identify Q15788 as a novel P84022 /4 transcriptional partner , facilitating the functional link between P84022 and p300/CBP .
