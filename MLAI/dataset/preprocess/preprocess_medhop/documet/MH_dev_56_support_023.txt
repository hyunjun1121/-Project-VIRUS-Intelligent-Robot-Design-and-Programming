The effect of etanercept on osteoclast precursor frequency and enhancing bone marrow oedema in patients with psoriatic arthritis . OBJECTIVE : The frequency of osteoclast precursors ( OCPF ) and the presence of bone marrow oedema ( BMO ) are potential response biomarkers in psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) . Previous studies suggest a central role for tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) in the formation of osteoclast precursors . To better understand this association , the effect of etanercept on OCPF and BMO was analysed in PsA patients with erosive arthritis . METHODS : A total of 20 PsA patients with active erosive PsA were enrolled . DB00005 was administered twice weekly for 24 weeks . OCPF was measured and clinical assessments were performed at baseline , 2 , 12 and 24 weeks . Gadolinium enhanced MR images were obtained at baseline and 24 weeks . RESULTS : Significant improvements in joint score ( p < 0.001 ) , HAQ scores ( p < 0.001 ) and SF-36 parameters were observed after 6 months of therapy with etanercept compared to baseline . The median OCPF decreased from 24.5 to 9 ( p = 0.04 ) and to 7 ( p = 0.006 ) after 3 months and 6 months of treatment , respectively . MR images were available for 13 patients . The BMO volume decreased in 47 and increased in 31 sites at 6 months . No correlation was noted between OCPF , BMO and clinical parameters . CONCLUSION : The rapid decline in OCPF and overall improvement in BMO after anti-TNFalpha therapy provides one mechanism to explain the anti-erosive effects of P01375 blockade in PsA . Persistence of BMO after etanercept treatment , despite a marked clinical response , was unexpected , and suggests ongoing subchondral inflammation or altered remodelling in PsA bone .
