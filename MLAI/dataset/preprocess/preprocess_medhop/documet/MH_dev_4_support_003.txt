DB04958 , a humanized anti- P20273 antibody , in aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma : phase I/II clinical trial results . PURPOSE : We conducted a single-center , dose-escalation study evaluating the safety , pharmacokinetics , and efficacy of epratuzumab , an anti- P20273 humanized monoclonal antibody , in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : DB04958 was administered once weekly for 4 weeks at 120-1000-mg/m2 doses to 56 patients [ most ( n = 35 ) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ] . RESULTS : Patients were heavily pretreated ( median , 4 prior therapies ) , 25 % received prior high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant , and 84 % had bulky disease ( > or =5 cm ) . DB04958 was well tolerated , with no dose-limiting toxicity . Most ( 95 % ) infusions were completed within 1 h . The mean serum half-life was 23.9 days . Across all dose levels and histologies , objective responses ( ORs ) were observed in five patients ( 10 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 3-21 % ) , including three complete responses . In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , 15 % had ORs . Overall , 11 ( 20 % ) patients experienced some tumor mass reduction . Median duration of OR was 26.3 weeks , and median time to progression for responders was 35 weeks . Two responses are ongoing at > or =34 months , including one rituximab-refractory patient . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that epratuzumab has a good safety profile and exerts antitumor activity in aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma at doses of > or =240 mg/m2 , thus warranting further evaluation in this clinical setting .
