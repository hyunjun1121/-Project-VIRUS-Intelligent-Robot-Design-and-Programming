Partial characterization of a neurotransmitter pathway regulating the in vivo release of prolactin . Nicotinic cholinergic , opiate and serotonergic agonists as well as dopaminergic antagonists induce the release of pituitary prolactin . The purposes of the present studies were to determine if nicotine , morphine and the serotonin1A ( P08908 ) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) utilize a common synaptic pathway to release prolactin and , if so , to establish the serial order of the receptors involved . We also sought to determine whether the pathway under investigation leads to the secretion of prolactin via a mechanism involving dopamine , the prolactin inhibitory factor . Male rats with indwelling jugular catheters were pretreated with saline , mecamylamine , naltrexone , methysergide or bromocriptine . In the saline-treated animals , administration of nicotine , morphine , 8-OH-DPAT and haloperidol resulted in significant increases in plasma prolactin levels . DB00657 pretreatment prevented the prolactin response to nicotine only . Naltrexone blocked the stimulation of prolactin release by morphine and by nicotine . Methysergide inhibited the effects of 8-OH-DPAT , morphine and nicotine but not haloperidol . DB01200 blocked the prolactin secretion induced by haloperidol as well as by each of the above agonists . Also , in dual-immunocytochemically stained sections , tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells and serotonin-immunoreactive processes were detected in close anatomical proximity in the dorsomedial arcuate nucleus . These data indicate that nicotine , morphine and 8-OH-DPAT act to release prolactin via a common synaptic pathway expressing nicotinic cholinergic , opiate , and P08908 receptors at synapses arranged serially in that functional order . Furthermore , the data indicate that the in vivo secretion of prolactin via this pathway may ultimately occur through the inhibition of dopamine release .
