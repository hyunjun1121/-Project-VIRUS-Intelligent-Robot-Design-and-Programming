Biologics in the management of ulcerative colitis - comparative safety and efficacy of P01375 -α antagonists . Ulcerative colitis can cause debilitating symptoms and complications such as colonic strictures , colonic dysplasia , colorectal cancer , and toxic megacolon or perforation . Goals of treatment in ulcerative colitis include resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms , healing of colonic mucosa , and prevention of disease complications . Our treatment armamentarium has expanded dramatically over the past 10 years , and we now have multiple biologic agents approved for the treatment of moderate-severe disease , in addition to conventional therapies such as 5-aminosalicylates , thiopurines , and corticosteroids . In this review , we will provide a detailed discussion of the three tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 -α ) inhibitors currently approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis : infliximab , adalimumab , and DB06674 . All three agents are effective for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in patients with ulcerative colitis , and they have comparable safety profiles . There are no head-to-head trials comparing their efficacy , and the choice of agent is most often based on insurance coverage , route of administration , and patient preference . Combination therapy with an immunomodulator is proven to be more effective than anti- P01375 monotherapy , and patients who lose response to an anti- P01375 agent should undergo dose intensification in order to regain clinical response . Despite therapeutic optimization , a significant percentage of patients will not achieve clinical remission with anti- P01375 agents , and so newer therapies are on the horizon .
