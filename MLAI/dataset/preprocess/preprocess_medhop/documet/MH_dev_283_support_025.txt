DB00158 -related nutrients , genetic polymorphisms , and colorectal cancer risk : the fukuoka colorectal cancer study . One-carbon metabolism plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis . Meta-analyses have suggested protective associations of folate and vitamin B6 intakes with colorectal cancer primarily based on studies in Caucasians , and genetic polymorphisms pertaining to the folate metabolism have been a matter of interest . Less investigated are the roles of methionine synthase ( Q99707 ) and thymidylate synthetase ( TS ) polymorphisms in colorectal carcinogenesis . In a study of 816 cases and 815 community controls in Japan , we investigated associations of dietary intakes of folate , methionine , vitamin B2 , vitamin B6 , and vitamin B12 with colorectal cancer risk . The associations with Q99707 2756A > G , Q9UBK8 66A > G , and TSER repeat polymorphism were examined in 685 cases and 778 controls . DB00134 and vitamin B12 intakes were inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk , but the associations were totally confounded by dietary calcium and n-3 fatty acids . The other nutrients showed no association with the risk even without adjustment for calcium and n-3 fatty acids . The TSER 2R allele was dose-dependently associated with an increased risk . The Q99707 and Q9UBK8 polymorphisms were unrelated to colorectal cancer risk . There was no measurable gene-gene or gene-nutrient interaction , but increased risk associated with the TSER 2R allele seemed to be confined to individuals with high folate status . This study does not support protective associations for folate and vitamin B6 . The TSER 2R allele may confer an increased risk of colorectal cancer . The role of the TSER polymorphism in colorectal carcinogenesis may differ by ethnicity .
