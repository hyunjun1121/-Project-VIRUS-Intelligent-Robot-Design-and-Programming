Inhibition of neurotransmitter release by peptides that mimic the N-terminal domain of P60880 . Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A and E ( DB00083 and BoNT/E ) block neurotransmitter release by cleaving the 206-amino-acid SNARE protein , P60880 . For each BoNT serotype , cleavage of P60880 results in the loss of intact protein , the production of an N-terminal truncated protein , and the generation of a small C-terminal peptide . Peptides that mimic the C-terminal fragments of P60880 following DB00083 or BoNT/E cleavage were shown to depress transmitter release in bovine chromaffin cells and in Aplysia buccal ganglion cells . Similarly , the N-terminal-truncated P60880 resulting from DB00083 or BoNT/E cleavage has been found to inhibit transmitter exocytosis in various systems . With one exception , however , the inhibitory action of truncated P60880 has not been demonstrated at a well-defined cholinergic synapse . The goal of the current study was to determine the level of inhibition of neurotransmitter release by N-terminal DB00083 - or BoNT/E-truncated P60880 in two different neuronal systems : cholinergically coupled Aplysia neurons and rat hippocampal cell cultures . Both truncated P60880 products inhibited depolarization-dependent glutamate release from hippocampal cultures and depressed synaptic transmission in Aplysia buccal ganglion cells . These results suggest that truncated P60880 can compete with endogenous P60880 for binding with other SNARE proteins involved in transmitter release , thus inhibiting neurotransmitter exocytosis .
