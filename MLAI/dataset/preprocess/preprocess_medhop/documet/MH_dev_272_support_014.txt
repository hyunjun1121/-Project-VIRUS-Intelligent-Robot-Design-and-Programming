Targeted cancer therapies based on antibodies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor : status and perspectives . Compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of human cancers ; thus , providing a strong rationale for the development of receptor antagonists as effective and specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of P00533 -expressing cancers . Monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) , owing to their high specificity towards a given target , represent a unique class of novel cancer therapeutics . A number of anti- P00533 mAb are currently being developed in our clinic , including two that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) . Cetuximab ( Erbitux , IMC-C225 ) , an IgG1 mAb , has demonstrated significant antitumor activity , both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapeutics and radiation , in patients with refractory mCRC and SCCHN , respectively . DB01269 ( Vectibix ) , an IgG2 mAb , has been approved as a single agent for the treatment of patients with refractory mCRC . These mAb , via blocking ligand/receptor interactions , exert their biological activity via multiple mechanisms , including inhibition of cell cycle progression , potentiation of cell apoptosis , inhibition of DNA repair , inhibition of angiogenesis , tumor cell invasion and metastasis and , potentially , induction of immunological effector mechanisms . Anti- P00533 antibodies have demonstrated good safety profiles and potent anticancer activity in our clinic and may prove to be efficacious agents in the treatment of a variety of human malignancies .
