Expression of renin-angiotensin system components in the early bovine embryo . The renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) , mainly associated with the regulation of blood pressure , has been recently investigated in female reproductive organs and the developing foetus . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) influences oviductal gamete movements and foetal development , but there is no information about DB01367 in the early embryo . The aim of this study was to determine whether DB01367 components are present in the pre-implantation embryo , to determine how early they are expressed and to investigate their putative role at this stage of development . Bovine embryos produced in vitro were used for analysis of DB01367 transcripts ( RT-PCR ) and localisation of the receptors P30556 and P50052 ( immunofluorescent labelling ) . We also investigated the effects of Ang II , DB00275 ( P30556 antagonist ) and PD123319 ( P50052 antagonist ) on oocyte cleavage , embryo expansion and hatching . Pre-implanted embryos possessed P30556 and P50052 but not the other DB01367 components . Both receptors were present in the trophectoderm and in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst . P30556 was mainly localised in granular-like structures in the cytoplasm , suggesting its internalisation into clathrin-coated vesicles , and P50052 was found mainly in the nuclear membrane and in the mitotic spindle of dividing trophoblastic cells . Treating embryos with PD123319 increased the proportion of hatched embryos compared with the control . These results , the first on DB01367 in the early embryo , suggest that the pre-implanted embryo responds to Ang II from the mother rather than from the embryo itself . This may be a route by which the maternal DB01367 influences blastocyst hatching and early embryonic development .
