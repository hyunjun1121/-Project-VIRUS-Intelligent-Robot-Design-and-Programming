DB08860 , an P04035 inhibitor , ameliorates endothelial function in chronic smokers . BACKGROUND : Smoking is a major cardiovascular risk factor , leading to endothelial dysfunction . The present study investigated the hypothesis that pitavastatin , an P04035 inhibitor , may improve endothelial function in chronic smokers via its antioxidant properties . METHODS AND RESULTS : The 30 male chronic smokers who exhibited mild hypercholesterolemia at the time of physical check-up were enrolled and randomized to the pitavastatin group ( 2 mg/day , n=15 ) or the untreated control group ( n=15 ) . Before and after the 4-week treatment period , endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) and endothelium-independent dilation by glyceryl trinitrate ( GTD ) were examined , and the FMD/GTD ratio was calculated . The pitavastatin group showed a significant restoration of endothelial function ( percent change in FMD : +49.6 % vs +1.4 % ; percent change in FMD/GTD ratio : +26.6 % vs 4.5 % , P < 0.05 respectively ) , and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels ( malondialdehyde-low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol : 16.6 % vs +7.5 % ; free radical activity : 1.8 % vs +9.7 % , P < 0.05 respectively ) compared with the control group . DB08860 had no effect on the number of circulating P28906 (+)CD133(+) progenitor cells , endothelial progenitor cells , or the P08253 , P14780 and P15692 levels . In vitro oxidative stress monitoring assay revealed that pitavastatin protected endothelial cells against oxidative stress . CONCLUSIONS : DB08860 restores endothelial function , even in chronic smokers , possibly through its antioxidative properties . ( Circ J 2010 ; 74 : 195 - 202 ) .
