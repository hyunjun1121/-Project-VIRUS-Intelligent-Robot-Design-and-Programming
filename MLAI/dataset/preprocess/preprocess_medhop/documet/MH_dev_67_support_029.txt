Transient transfection of GGH3-1 ' cells [ GH3 cells stably transfected with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) receptor complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ] with the carboxyl-terminal of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 blocks prolactin release : evidence for a role of the G protein beta gamma-subunit complex in DB00644 signal transduction . G proteins consist of heterotrimeric alpha- , beta- , and gamma-subunits . To assess the role of the beta gamma-subunit complex in P30968 -mediated signal transduction , GGH3-1 ' cells were transfected with plasmids PRK5-beta O14965 ( 495-689 ) containing complementary DNA ( cDNA ) of the carboxyl-terminal ( Gly495-Leu689 ) of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 ( beta O14965 ) . GGH3-1 ' cells are GH3 cells that have been stably transfected with rat P30968 cDNA . The carboxyl region of beta O14965 ( Gly495-Leu689 ) binds to the beta gamma complex and thereby inhibits its action . Twenty-four hours after stimulation , PRL release , DB02527 release , and inositol phosphate ( IP ) production were measured in these cells and in control cells transfected with vector PRK5 cDNA alone . In cells expressing the beta O14965 -(495-689) sequence there was inhibition of basal PRL release ( 69.3 % ) , DB02527 release ( 61.2 % ) , and IP production ( 75.5 % ) compared to cells containing vector only . When cells expressing the beta O14965 fragment were stimulated with a DB00644 analog ( DB06719 ; 10(-7) M ) , maximal responses were inhibited ( 66.1 % for PRL release , 52.3 % for DB02527 release , and 79.1 % for IP production ) . Scatchard analysis of DB00644 analog binding was also performed in the two groups of transfected cells . No significant differences in Kd or receptor numbers were found between beta O14965 -(495-689)-transfected cells and control cells containing the vector alone . These data suggest a role for the beta gamma complex in mediation of DB02527 release , IP production , and hormone release in response to agonist occupancy of the P30968 .
