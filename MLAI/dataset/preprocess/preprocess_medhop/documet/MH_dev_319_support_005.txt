Carbon-ion beam irradiation kills X-ray-resistant p53-null cancer cells by inducing mitotic catastrophe . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : To understand the mechanisms involved in the strong killing effect of carbon-ion beam irradiation on cancer cells with P04637 tumor suppressor gene deficiencies . MATERIALS AND METHODS : DNA damage responses after carbon-ion beam or X-ray irradiation in isogenic HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines with and without P04637 ( p53+/+ and p53-/- , respectively ) were analyzed as follows : cell survival by clonogenic assay , cell death modes by morphologic observation of DAPI-stained nuclei , DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) by immunostaining of phosphorylated P16104 ( Î³ P16104 ) , and cell cycle by flow cytometry and immunostaining of Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 . RESULTS : The p53-/- cells were more resistant than the p53+/+ cells to X-ray irradiation , while the sensitivities of the p53+/+ and p53-/- cells to carbon-ion beam irradiation were comparable . X-ray and carbon-ion beam irradiations predominantly induced apoptosis of the p53+/+ cells but not the p53-/- cells . In the p53-/- cells , carbon-ion beam irradiation , but not X-ray irradiation , markedly induced mitotic catastrophe that was associated with premature mitotic entry with harboring long-retained DSBs at 24 h post-irradiation . CONCLUSIONS : Efficient induction of mitotic catastrophe in apoptosis-resistant p53-deficient cells implies a strong cancer cell-killing effect of carbon-ion beam irradiation that is independent of the p53 status , suggesting its biological advantage over X-ray treatment .
