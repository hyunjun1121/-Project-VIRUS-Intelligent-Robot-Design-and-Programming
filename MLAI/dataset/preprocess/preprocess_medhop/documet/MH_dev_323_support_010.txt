An acidic pH environment increases cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in osteoblasts : the involvement of Q07812 inhibitor-1 . Q07812 Inhibitor-1 ( P55061 ) , a transmembrane protein on the endoplasmic reticulum , has been studied previously in various physio/pathological conditions , but not in bone cells . In this study , using the MG63 osteoblast cell line and osteoblasts differentiated from stem cells , the role of P55061 was studied . First , expression of P55061 was confirmed in osteoblasts , as well as osteoclasts , in mouse tibiae bone immunohistochemistry . For evaluation of a recently published property of P55061 , an acidic pH-dependent Ca²⁺ channel-like effect in osteoblasts , acidic pH-associated cell death , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release were examined . In MG63 osteoblasts , acidic pH induced a pH-dependent increase in cell death and ER stress , as determined by elevated expression of P11021 , P35638 , phospho-eIF2α , IRE-1α , spliced P17861 , and phospho-JNK . In osteoblasts , mitochondrial Ca²⁺ also showed a strong pH-dependent increase . P55061 knock-down using siRNA protected cells against acidic pH , regulating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ accumulation , possibly via the acidic pH-dependent Ca²⁺ channel-like effect of P55061 . P55061 knock-down also resulted in inhibition of acidic pH-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , including IL-1β , P05231 , and P01375 -α . In addition , bone marrow stem cells were differentiated into human osteoblasts , which showed increased expression of P55061 mRNA and protein . In differentiated primary human osteoblasts , acidic pH-associated cell death , mitochondrial Ca²⁺ accumulation , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release were more significant than in non-differentiated stem cells . In summary , endogenous expression of P55061 is associated with acidic pH-induced Ca²⁺ release , cell death , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in human osteoblasts .
