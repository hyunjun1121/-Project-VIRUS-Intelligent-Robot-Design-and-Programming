The in vitro pharmacological profile of DB05655 , a selective 5-HT(4) receptor agonist with high intrinsic activity . The in vitro pharmacological profile of DB05655 , a novel , selective 5-HT(4) receptor agonist , was compared to that of clinically efficacious gastroprokinetic 5-HT(4) receptor agonists . DB05655 produced an elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the human recombinant 5-HT(4(c)) ( h5-HT(4(c)) ) receptor ( pEC(50) = 8.3 ) and 5-HT(4) receptor-mediated relaxation of the rat esophagus ( pEC(50) = 7.9 ) and contraction of the guinea pig colon ( pEC(50) = 7.9 ) . In all in vitro assays , DB05655 was a high intrinsic activity agonist , unlike tegaserod , mosapride , and cisapride which , in the majority of test systems , had lower intrinsic activity . DB05655 had high affinity ( pK ( i ) = 7.7 ) and selectivity ( > or =25-fold ) for h5-HT(4(c)) receptors over other biogenic amine receptors . DB05655 was > 500-fold selective over other 5-HT receptors ( including h5-HT(2B) and h5-HT(3A) ) and , at 3 microM , had no effect on human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene K+ channels . In conclusion , DB05655 is a selective 5-HT(4) receptor agonist in vitro . The high intrinsic activity and preferential binding of DB05655 to Q13639 over other 5-HT receptors may result in an improved clinical profile for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders of reduced motility .
