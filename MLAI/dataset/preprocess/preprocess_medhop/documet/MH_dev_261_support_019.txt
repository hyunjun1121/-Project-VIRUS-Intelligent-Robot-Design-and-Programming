P04271 -mediated inhibition of the phosphorylation of P14136 is prevented by TRTK-12 . P04271 belongs to a family of calcium-binding proteins involved in cell cycle and cytoskeleton regulation . We observed an inhibitory effect of P04271 on glial fibrillary acidic protein ( P14136 ) phosphorylation , when stimulated by DB02527 or Ca2+/calmodulin , in a cytoskeletal fraction from primary astrocyte cultures . We found that P04271 has no direct effect on P62158 KII activity , the major kinase in this cytoskeletal fraction able to phosphorylate P14136 . The inhibition of P14136 phosphorylation is most likely due to the binding of P04271 to the phosphorylation sites on this protein and blocking the access of these sites to the protein kinases . This inhibition was dependent on Ca2+ . However , DB01593 could substitute for Ca2+ . The inhibitory effect of P04271 was prevented by TRTK-12 , a peptide that blocks P04271 interaction with several target proteins including glial fibrillary acidic protein . These data suggest a role for P04271 in the assembly of intermediate filaments in astrocytes .
