DB04873 ( SB 207266 ) , a selective Q13639 receptor antagonist , reduces serotonin potentiation of neurally-mediated contractile responses of human detrusor muscle . The aim of this study is to evaluate the potency of piboserod ( SB 207266 ) , a selective 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist , at inhibiting the 5-HT(4)-mediated potentiating effect of serotonin ( 5-HT ) on the neurally-mediated contractile responses of human detrusor strips to electrical field stimulations ( O43281 ) . Strips of human detrusor muscle were mounted in Krebs-HEPES buffer under a resting tension of 500 mg and O43281 ( 20 Hz , 1 ms duration at 300 mA for 5 s ) was applied continuously at 1 min intervals . After stabilization of the O43281 -induced contractions , concentration-response curves to 5-HT ( 0.1 nM-100 microM ) were constructed in the absence or presence of 1 or 100 nM of piboserod . The experiments were performed in the presence of methysergide ( 1 microM ) and ondansetron ( 3 microM ) to block 5HT(1)/5HT(2) and 5-HT(3) receptors , respectively . 5-HT potentiated the contractile responses to O43281 of human bladder strips in a concentration-dependent manner , with a maximum mean of 60.0+/-19.9 % of the basal O43281 -evoked contractions . DB04873 did not modify the basal contractions but concentration-dependently antagonized the ability of 5-HT to enhance bladder strip contractions to O43281 . In presence of 1 and 100 nM of piboserod , the maximal 5-HT-induced potentiations were reduced to 45.0+/-7.9 and 38.7+/-8.7 % , respectively . A mean apparent antagonist dissociation constant value ( K(B) ) of 0.56+/-0.09 nM was determined . These data show the ability of piboserod to antagonize with high potency the enhancing properties of 5-HT on neurally-mediated contractions of isolated human bladder strips . Therefore , the 5-HT(4) receptor might represent an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of overactive bladder .
