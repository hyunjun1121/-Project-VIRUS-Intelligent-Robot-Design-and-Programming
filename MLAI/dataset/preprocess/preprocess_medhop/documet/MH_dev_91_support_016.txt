An ordered NotI fragment map of human chromosome band 11p15 . An ordered NotI fragment map containing over 60 loci and encompassing approximately 17 Mb has been constructed for human chromosome band 11p15 . Forty-two probes , including 11 NotI-linking cosmids , were subregionally mapped to 11p15 using a subset of the J1-deletion hybrids . These and 23 other probes defining loci previously mapped to 11p15 were hybridized to genomic DNA digested with NotI and 5 other infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes and separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . Thirty-nine distinct NotI fragments were detected encompassing approximately 85 % of the estimated length of 11p15 . The predicted order of the gene loci used is cen- P15172 -PTH-CALCA- P78524 - P25800 - P02790 - P68871 - P23921 -TH/ P01308 / P01344 -H19- P07339 - Q02817 - P21917 - P01112 - P13489 -tel . This map will allow higher resolution mapping of new 11p15 markers , facilitate positional cloning of disease genes , and provide a framework for the physical mapping of 11p15 in clone contigs .
