The influence of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands on anxiety-like effect of amphetamine withdrawal in rats . Chronic amphetamine use results in anxiety-like states after drug cessation . The aim of the study was to determine a role of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands in amphetamine-evoked withdrawal anxiety in the elevated plus-maze test in rats . In our study memantine ( 8 and 12 mg/kg ) , a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist did not reduce amphetamine withdrawal anxiety . DB00659 ( DB01221 and metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor ( P41594 ) antagonist ) at the dose 200 and 400mg/kg showed anxiolytic-like effect , thus increasing the percent of time spent in open arms and a number of open arm entries . P41594 selective antagonist , MTEP ( 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine hydrochloride ) and Q14416 /3 agonist , LY354740 ( 1S,2S,5R,6S ) -2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid ) , caused effects similar to acamprosate at doses 1.25-5mg/kg and 2.5-5mg/kg , respectively . None of the glutamate ligands influenced locomotor activity of rats when given to the saline-treated group . Taking into account the positive correlation between amphetamine withdrawal-induced anxiety and relapse to amphetamine taking , our results suggest that modulation of mGluRs may prevent relapse to amphetamine and might pose a new direction in amphetamine abuse therapy .
