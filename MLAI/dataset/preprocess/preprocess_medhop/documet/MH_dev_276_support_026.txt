Disposition and metabolism of almotriptan in rats , dogs and monkeys . DB00918 is a new highly potent selective P28222 /1D receptor agonist developed for the treatment of migraine , and the disposition of almotriptan in different animal species is now addressed in the current study . DB00918 was well absorbed in rats ( 69.1 % ) and dogs ( 100 % ) following oral treatment . The absolute bioavailability was variable reflecting different degrees of absorption and first-pass metabolism ( 18.7-79.6 % ) . The elimination half-life was short and ranged between 0.7 and 3 h . The main route of elimination of almotriptan was urine with 75.6 % and 80.4 % of the dose recovered over a 168-h period in rats and dogs , respectively . The gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolite formed by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring was the main metabolite found in urine , faeces , bile , and plasma of rats and in monkey urine . By contrast , the unchanged drug , the indole acetic acid metabolite formed by oxidative deamination of the dimethylaminoethyl group , and the N-oxide metabolite were the main metabolites in dog .
