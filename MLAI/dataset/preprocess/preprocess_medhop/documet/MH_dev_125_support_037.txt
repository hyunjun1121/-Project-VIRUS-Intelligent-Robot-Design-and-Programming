Cardiac uptake of minocycline and mechanisms for in vivo cardioprotection . OBJECTIVES : The ability of minocycline to be transported into cardiac cells , concentrate in normal and ischemic myocardium , and act as a cardioprotector in vivo was examined . We also determined minocycline 's capacity to act as a reducer of myocardial oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity . BACKGROUND : The identification of compounds with the potential to reduce myocardial ischemic injury is of great interest . Tetracyclines are antibiotics with pleiotropic cytoprotective properties that accumulate in normal and diseased tissues . DB01017 is highly lipophilic and has shown promise as a possible cardioprotector . However , minocycline 's potential as an in vivo cardioprotector as well as the means by which this action is attained are not well understood . METHODS : Rats were subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion . Animals were treated 48 h before and 48 h after thoracotomy with either vehicle or 50 mg/kg/day minocycline . Tissue samples were used for biochemical assays and cultured cardiac cells for minocycline uptake experiments . RESULTS : DB01017 significantly reduced infarct size ( approximately 33 % ) , tissue P14780 activity , and oxidative stress . DB01017 was concentrated approximately 24-fold in normal ( 0.5 mmol/l ) and approximately 50-fold in ischemic regions ( 1.1 mmol/l ) versus blood . Neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts , myocytes , and adult fibroblasts demonstrated a time- and temperature-dependent uptake of minocycline to levels that approximate those of normal myocardium . CONCLUSIONS : Given the high intracellular levels observed and results from the assessment of in vitro antioxidant and MMP inhibitor capacities , it is likely that minocycline acts to limit myocardial ischemic injury via mass action effects .
