Leukotriene C4 production during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in isolated rat lungs . Leukotriene inhibitors preferentially inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in isolated rat lungs . If lipoxygenase products are involved in the hypoxic pressor response they might be produced during acute alveolar hypoxia and a leukotriene inhibitor should block both the vasoconstriction and leukotriene production that occurs in response to hypoxia . We investigated in isolated blood perfused rat lungs whether leukotriene C4 ( LTC4 ) could be recovered from whole lung lavage fluid during ongoing hypoxic vasoconstriction . Lung lavage from individual rats had slow reacting substance ( SRS ) -like myotropic activity by guinea pig ileum bioassay . Pooled lavage ( 10 lungs ) as analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography had an ultraviolet absorbing component at the retention time for LTC4 . At radioimmunoassay , and SRS myotropic activity by bioassay . LTC4 was not found during normoxic ventilation , during normoxic ventilation after a hypoxic pressor response , or during vasoconstriction elicited by DB00761 . DB00711 citrate , a leukotriene synthesis blocker , concomitantly inhibited the hypoxic vasoconstriction and LTC4 production . Thus P09917 products may play a role in the sequence of events leading to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction .
