Regulation of the natural killer cell response to interferon-alpha by biogenic amines . Monocytes , recovered from human peripheral blood by counter-current centrifugal elutriation ( CCE ) , suppressed baseline natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity ( NKCC ) and rendered NK cells resistant to activation of cytotoxicity by human recombinant interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) by a cell contact-dependent mechanism . Monocyte-induced suppression of resting and IFN-activated NK cells was abrogated by the biogenic amines histamine [ via H2-type receptors ( P25021 ) ] and serotonin [ via P08908 -type receptors ( 5-HT1AR ) ] . Our data are suggestive of a monocyte/NK cell interaction that is subject to regulation by biogenic amines .
