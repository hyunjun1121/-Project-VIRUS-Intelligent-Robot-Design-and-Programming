Not all monoclonals are created equal - lessons from failed drug trials in Crohn 's disease . The recent success of the anti-integrin antibody DB09033 can barely conceal the fact that the biologics armamentarium in Crohn 's disease has barely evolved beyond P01375 blockers so far . This contrasts with other immune-related diseases considered mechanistically and genetically closely related , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis , where approved biologics target a variety of independent biological mechanisms . Several pharmacological assets that entered clinical development have proven ineffective , or less effective than originally anticipated . While blockade of Q16552 and its receptor via DB09029 and Brodalumab , respectively , worsened Crohn 's disease , the beneficial effect of IL-12/23 p40 blockade via Ustekinumab appeared confined to a subpopulation of Crohn 's disease patients who have previously failed on P01375 blockers . Clinical development of the IFNÎ³ blocker DB05111 was stopped despite demonstrating some clinical benefit , while the T cell co-stimulation blocker DB01281 did not exhibit any hint towards efficacy in Crohn 's disease . Here I review results from these individual development programmes , and also reflect on the lack of efficacy of the P01375 blocker DB00005 . I will discuss aspects of individual trials that might have confounded their interpretation and highlight the evolution in primary and secondary endpoints that have contributed to increasing robustness of results obtained in recent years . Finally , I suggest that mechanistic studies in murine genetic models combined with exploratory immunological studies incorporated in early drug development may represent the key for identifying the next generation of successful pharmacological targets in Crohn 's disease .
