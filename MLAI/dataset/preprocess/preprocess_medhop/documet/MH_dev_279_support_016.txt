Lipid-lowering response of the P04035 inhibitor fluvastatin is influenced by polymorphisms in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in Brazilian patients with primary hypercholesterolemia . Although the efficacy of fluvastatin ( P04035 inhibitor ) in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia is well documented , a wide interindividual variation treatment response has been observed . We have studied the possible role of the AvaII ( exon 13 ) , HincII ( exon 12 ) , and PvuII ( intron 15 ) polymorphisms at the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( P01130 ) gene on lipid-lowering response in 55 patients ( 36 to 70 years old ) with primary hypercholesterolemia treated with fluvastatin for 16 weeks . P01130 genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP . The results indicate that the AvaII and PvuII polymorphisms influence the cholesterol-lowering response of the P04035 inhibitor DB01095 . Patients carrying A+A+ ( AvaII ) or P1P1 ( PvuII ) homozygous genotypes presented lower reduction in total cholesterol , LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels after 16 weeks of treatment with fluvastatin , when compared to other genotypes ( P < 0.05 ) . Our data also support the previous assumption that the AvaII , HincII , and PvuII polymorphisms of the P01130 gene are associated with variation of serum cholesterol levels . Therefore , the identification of the P01130 genetic profile may provide better prediction of a patient 's clinical response to fluvastatin .
