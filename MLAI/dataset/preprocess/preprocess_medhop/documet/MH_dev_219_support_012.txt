DB05595 in lung cancer . DB00158 is essential for proliferating cells and folate transport pathways and folate-dependent metabolic processes show promise as targets for anti-neoplastic therapy . DB00158 receptor Î± ( P15328 ) , a folate transporter , is an attractive target for anti-neoplastic therapy due to its high affinity for folate , restricted range of expression in normal tissue and differential over-expression in malignant tissue . P15328 is expressed in non-small cell lung cancer , with a higher expression in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma . DB05595 is a monoclonal antibody targeting P15328 which in pre-clinical studies led to cytotoxicity of P15328 -expressing cells , inhibited tumor growth in animal models and showed limited reactivity with normal tissue . In phase I/II trials , farletuzumab was well tolerated as a single-agent and in combination , without additive toxicity with chemotherapy . An ongoing phase II , double blind , placebo-controlled study is evaluating farletuzumab in patients with P15328 expressing metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung .
