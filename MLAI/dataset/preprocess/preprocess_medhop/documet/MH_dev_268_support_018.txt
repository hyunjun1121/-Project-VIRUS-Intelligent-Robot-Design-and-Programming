DB01064 inhibits fibroblast growth factor-2-induced growth of renal epithelial cells . The signal transduction pathways modulating P09038 effects in renal tubular epithelial cells ( RTEc ) are not completely understood . Since the DB02527 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways can modulate the growth of RTEc , we studied whether two DB02527 elevating agents , isoproterenol and 8-bromo- DB02527 , would modulate basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) induction of MAPK activity ( P28482 ) and cell proliferation in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells ( RPTEc ) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells ( MDCK clone EI1 ) . DB01064 , but not P09038 , stimulated DB02527 production in RPTEc and MDCKEI1 cells . P09038 , isoproterenol , and 8-bromo- DB02527 alone increased P28482 activity in both cell types . However , isoproterenol and 8-bromo- DB02527 partially inhibited the P09038 induction of P28482 activity , but only isoproterenol inhibited the proliferation of both cell types . PD098059 ( 25 microM ) , an inhibitor of MAPK kinase ( Q02750 /2 ) , blocked the P09038 mitogenic effects , but did not affect the 8-bromo- DB02527 -induced mitogenic effects in MDCKEI1 cells . These findings suggest that activation of P28482 is required but not sufficient for mitogenesis in RTEc . We conclude that isoproterenol inhibits the growth-promoting effects of P09038 in RTEc via MEK-dependent and -independent pathways .
