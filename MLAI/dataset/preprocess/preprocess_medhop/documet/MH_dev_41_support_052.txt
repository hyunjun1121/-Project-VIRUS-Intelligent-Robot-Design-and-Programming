In vivo alemtuzumab enables haploidentical human leukocyte antigen-mismatched hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation without ex vivo graft manipulation . BACKGROUND : DB00087 , a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human P31358 , has a strong lympholytic effect . This study evaluates the safety of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from two or three loci-mismatched related donors using alemtuzumab in vivo . METHODS : A total body irradiation-based regimen was used in young patients , whereas those 50 years or older received fludarabine-based conditioning . DB00087 was added to these regimens by intravenous infusion at 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 days ( days -8 to -3 ) . RESULTS : We treated 12 patients with a median age of 49.5 years . Eight patients demonstrated active disease , and four patients demonstrated acute leukemia in high-risk remission . All achieved neutrophil engraftment a median of 17.5 days after transplantation with complete donor-type chimerism . The cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was only 9 % . Infection-related deaths were not observed . CD3+/ P01730 + and CD3+/CD8+ T cells were strongly suppressed within 2 months after transplantation , but recovered on day 90 . Relapse was observed in five of eight patients who underwent transplantation for active disease , whereas none of the three patients who underwent transplantation in first remission had a relapse . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that in vivo alemtuzumab enables haploidentical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation without ex vivo graft manipulation .
