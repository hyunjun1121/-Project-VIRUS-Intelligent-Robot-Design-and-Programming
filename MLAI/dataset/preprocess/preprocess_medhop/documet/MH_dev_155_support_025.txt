Neonatal exposure to anti-nerve growth factor antibodies affects exploratory behavior of developing mice in the hole board . The aim of this study was to assess in developing mice whether the neutralization of endogenous P01138 following ICV administration of anti- P01138 antibodies ( 50 micrograms/2 microliters ) on postnatal days 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 affected locomotor activity , exploratory behavior , and response to the cholinergic blocker scopolamine . In Experiments 1 and 2 activity and age-typical scopolamine effects were evaluated on P01160 13 or 17 in an automated apparatus . No significant main effect of anti- P01138 treatment was found at either age . On day 13 scopolamine ( 0.2 , 1 , or 2 mg/kg ) decreased locomotion in both anti- P01138 and control animals . In Experiment 3 , locomotion and exploratory behavior were analyzed in an open field arena or in a hole board apparatus on P01160 16 . No significant effects of anti- P01138 treatment on general motor activity and investigation of a novel object in the open field was found , though anti- P01138 animals tended to be less active than controls . In the hole board anti- P01138 pups showed a different pattern of head dipping behavior from controls , exploring mainly the holes located in the periphery of the apparatus .
