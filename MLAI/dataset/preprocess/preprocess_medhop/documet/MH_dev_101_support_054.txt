Determination of the class and isoform selectivity of small-molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors . The human HDAC ( histone deacetylase ) family , a well-validated anticancer target , plays a key role in the control of gene expression through regulation of transcription . While HDACs can be subdivided into three main classes , the class I , class II and class III HDACs ( sirtuins ) , it is presently unclear whether inhibiting multiple HDACs using pan-HDAC inhibitors , or targeting specific isoforms that show aberrant levels in tumours , will prove more effective as an anticancer strategy in the clinic . To address the above issues , we have tested a number of clinically relevant HDACis ( HDAC inhibitors ) against a panel of rhHDAC ( recombinant human HDAC ) isoforms . Eight rhHDACs were expressed using a baculoviral system , and a Fluor de Lystrade mark ( Biomol International ) HDAC assay was optimized for each purified isoform . The potency and selectivity of ten HDACs on class I isoforms ( rhHDAC1 , rhHDAC2 , rhHDAC3 and rhHDAC8 ) and class II HDAC isoforms ( rhHDAC4 , rhHDAC6 , rhHDAC7 and rhHDAC9 ) was determined . MS-275 was Q13547 -selective , DB05651 was Q13547 - and Q92769 -selective , apicidin was Q92769 - and O15379 -selective and valproic acid was a specific inhibitor of class I HDACs . The hydroxamic acid-derived compounds ( trichostatin A , DB00238 -LAQ824 , DB06603 , ITF2357 , vorinostat and belinostat ) were potent pan-HDAC inhibitors . The growth-inhibitory effect of the HDACis on HeLa cells showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitors inhibited cell growth . The results also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted in increased acetylation of histones , but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in increased tubulin acetylation , which is in agreement with their activity towards the Q9UBN7 isoform .
