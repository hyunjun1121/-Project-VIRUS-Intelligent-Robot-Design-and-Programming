A replication-competent adenovirus assay for E1-deleted Ad35 vectors produced in O15534 . P13671 cells . The presence of replication-competent adenovirus ( RCA ) is a safety concern for biologics based on recombinant adenoviruses and RCA testing is therefore mandatory for release of clinical material . RCA , which arises from homologous recombination between Ad5 vectors and P29320 -293 cells , can be eliminated by the use of O15534 . P13671 cells in combination with a matched vector . However , little is known on RCA formation with vectors based on adenovirus serotypes other than Ad5 and reliable RCA assays to test them are generally lacking . Here we report on the development and qualification of a sensitive RCA assay for Ad35 , a promising alternative to Ad5 vectors . The assay is able to detect 1 RCA in 3x10(10) vector particles with 95 % confidence , thus meeting current FDA requirements , and can discriminate between RCA and other rare P16870 -causing entities , including helper dependent E1 positive particles ( HDEP ) . Using this assay , the first batches of Ad35 vectors produced in O15534 . P13671 cells were analysed and found to be free of RCA and HDEP . Based on the statistical model used , we anticipate that our approach to RCA assay development can be broadly applicable to other adenoviral vectors .
