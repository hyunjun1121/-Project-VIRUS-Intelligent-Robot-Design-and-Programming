Developmental regulation of prostacyclin synthase and prostacyclin receptors in the ovine uterus and conceptus during the peri-implantation period . This study documents the expression of prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) synthase ( Q16647 ) and DB01240 receptors in the trophoblast and uterus of the ewe at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy ( i.e. days 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 and 17 ) . The membrane receptor for DB01240 ( P43119 ) and the nuclear receptors , i.e. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( Q07869 ) and their heterodimer partners the retinoid X receptors ( RXR ) , were analysed . In the endometrium , Q16647 transcript and protein were expressed at day 9 of pregnancy and levels declined from days 12 to 17 . Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization indicated that Q16647 was mainly located in the luminal epithelium of the endometrium . Endometrial P43119 , Q07869 , P37231 and P48443 expression was regulated during the peri-implantation period whereas Q03181 , P19793 and P28702 were consistently expressed . In the trophoblast , Q16647 transcript levels rose as development progressed and peaked at day 17 . P43119 and Q07869 transcripts peaked before day 12 and then declined and became nearly undetectable by day 17 , whereas Q03181 and P37231 transcript levels rose steadily from days 12 to 17 . Because the PPARs and the RXRs display different expression profiles , we suggest that different heterodimers may form and support distinct functions as development proceeds . Our results also underline the importance of Q16647 and Q03181 in the trophoblast and P43119 in the uterus , suggesting that DB01240 is of both uterine and trophoblastic origin and is involved in a complex signalling pathway at around the time of implantation in the ewe .
