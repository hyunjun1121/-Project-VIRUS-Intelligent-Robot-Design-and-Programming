Q13507 -like protein and vitamin D receptor mediate DB00136 -induced Q5T124 influx in muscle cells . 1alpha,25-Dihydroxy-Vitamin-D3 ( 1alpha,25(OH)2- DB00169 ) stimulates in skeletal muscle cells Ca2+ release from inner stores and influx through both voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca2+ ( Q5T124 , CCE ) channels . We investigated the involvement of TRPC proteins and Vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) in CCE induced by DB00136 in chick muscle cells . Two fragments were amplified by RT-PCR , exhibiting approximately 80 % sequence homology with mammalian Q13507 /6/7 . Northern and Western blots employing a Q13507 -probe and anti- Q13507 antibodies , respectively , confirmed endogenous expression of a Q13507 -like protein of 140 kDa . Spectrofluorimetric measurements in Fura-2 loaded cells showed reduced CCE and Mn2+ entry in response to either thapsigargin or DB00136 upon transfection with anti- Q13507 /6/7 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODNs ) . Transfection with anti- P11473 antisense ODNs diminished DB00136 -dependent Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx . Co-immunoprecipitation of Q13507 -like protein and P11473 under non-denaturating conditions was observed . We propose that endogenous Q13507 -like proteins and the P11473 participate in the modulation of CCE by DB00136 in muscle cells , which could be mediated by an interaction between these proteins .
