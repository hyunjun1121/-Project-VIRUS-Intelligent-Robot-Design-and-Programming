Behavioral suppression induced by cannabinoids is due to activation of the arachidonic acid cascade in rats . DB00470 ( THC ) is the principle psychoactive ingredient of marijuana and produces various psychoactive effects through the brain cannabinoid ( P21554 ) receptor . The P21554 receptor belongs to the seven-transmembrane domain family of G-protein-coupled receptors and is involved in the arachidonic acid cascade in the brain . Few reports have attempted to clarify the functional role of endogenous cannabinoid and the arachidonic acid cascade through the P21554 receptor using a behavioral paradigm . Therefore , in this study , we clarified the mechanism of cannabinoid-induced suppression of lever pressing in rats , focusing on the arachidonic acid cascade as a novel second messenger of P21554 receptor . Delta(8)-THC and the potent synthetic P21554 receptor agonist HU-210 dose-dependently inhibited lever-pressing performance . The Delta(8)-THC-induced suppression was significantly antagonized by the cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitors diclofenac ( 32 mg/kg , i.p. ) , aspirin ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) and indomethacin ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) . The suppressive effect of HU-210 was also significantly antagonized by 32 mg/kg diclofenac . Prostaglandin E(2) ( 3.2 microg/rat , i.c.v. ) , the final product of the arachidonic acid cascade , significantly inhibited lever pressing similar to Delta(8)-THC and HU-210 . In conclusion , we found that suppression of lever-pressing behavior induced by cannabinoids was mediated through activation of the arachidonic acid cascade via the P21554 receptor . Therefore , it is possible that the psychoactive effects of cannabinoid are due to an increase in the formation of PGE(2) in the brain .
