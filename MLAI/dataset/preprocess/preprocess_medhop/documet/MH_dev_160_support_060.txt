Crohn 's disease : a review of current treatment with a focus on biologics . Crohn 's disease is a debilitating and expensive disease that is growing in incidence in both developing and developed countries . While conventional therapies , such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants , continue to play a vital role in treating this condition , it is evident that many affected individuals do not respond to therapy or develop intolerable adverse effects . The addition of modern biological therapies to the Crohn 's disease armamentarium is providing a change in expectations for disease outcome . DB00065 and adalimumab are currently the only biological agents approved for induction and maintenance treatment in adults ( infliximab and adalimumab ) and children ( infliximab ) with Crohn 's disease . Furthermore , infliximab has a beneficial effect on perianal fistulas . Other tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha inhibitors , such as certolizumab pegol , also demonstrate promising results in adults with moderate to severe active disease . In addition , adalimumab and certolizumab pegol have shown clinical efficacy in patients who are intolerant to or lose response to infliximab , suggesting that switching between agents may allow response to be maintained over time . The primary safety concerns with TNFalpha inhibitors include increased risk of serious infection ( including reactivation of tuberculosis ) , malignancy ( particularly lymphoma ) and demyelinating disease . Other agents in development include recombinant human anti-inflammatory cytokines , agents that target pro-inflammatory cytokines and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors . Further prospective studies will provide interesting insight into different mechanisms by which factors involved in the pathophysiology of Crohn 's disease can be modulated .
