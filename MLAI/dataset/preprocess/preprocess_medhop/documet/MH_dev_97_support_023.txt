DB00501 enhances antigen-specific IgE and Th2 cytokine production . BACKGROUND : Treatment with anti-ulcer drugs has been shown to enhance IgE production against food antigens . However , little is known about the immunological effects of cimetidine , a histamine receptor type 2 ( P25021 ) antagonist that is widely used as an anti-ulcer drug , in allergy . Therefore , the present study investigated the role of cimetidine in Th2 immune responses in mice . METHODS : BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin ( OVA ) with and without cimetidine . The levels of cytokines in supernatants of spleen cells cultured in the presence of OVA for 4 days and the levels of total and OVA-specific IgG(1) , IgG(2a) and/or IgE in sera from these mice were determined by ELISA . RESULTS : Administration of cimetidine to OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice promoted Th2 cytokine secretion by OVA-stimulated spleen cells in vitro and increased serum levels of OVA-specific IgE , IgG(1) and IgG(2a) . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that cimetidine can enhance Th2 responses , suggesting that cimetidine may contribute to IgE production in allergies .
