Genetic factors influencing outcome from neurotrauma . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Clinical outcome after neurotrauma is considerably variable and can only partly be explained by known prognostic factors . There is converging evidence from genetic research that a number of genetic variants may contribute to this variability . This review provides recent data from human studies , published in the previous year , on genetic factors influencing outcome after neurotrauma . The bibliographic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies . RECENT FINDINGS : Genetic susceptibility to various aspects of clinical outcome after neurotrauma was reported in recent clinical studies . Genetic loci investigated include polymorphisms in P02649 , P21397 , P23560 , NOS3 , P05231 , P12036 , P31645 , P21964 , P48454 and Q8IX03 genes . The importance of these findings and future directions are discussed . SUMMARY : Recent genetic studies have revealed emerging aspects and extended the existing knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of neurotrauma and the genetic influence on phenotypic diversity . A better understanding of the underlying biological pathways and molecular mechanisms of an individual 's response to neurotrauma may hold the promise of novel treatment strategies and improved clinical outcome .
