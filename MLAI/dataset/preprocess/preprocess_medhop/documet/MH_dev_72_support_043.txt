P09874 inhibition-induced activation of P19957 -kinase-Akt pathway promotes resistance to taxol . PARP inhibitors combined with DNA-damage inducing cytostatic agents can lead to effective tumor therapy . However , inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( P09874 ; EC 2.4.2.30 ) induces the activation of P19957 -kinase-Akt pathway , which can counteract the effectiveness of this therapy . To understand the role of Akt activation in the combined use of cytostatic agent and PARP inhibition , we used taxol ( paclitaxel ) as an antineoplastic agent , which targets microtubules and up-regulates mitochondrial ROS production , together with ( i ) pharmacological inhibition ( PJ-34 ) , ( ii ) siRNA knock-down and ( iii ) transdominant expression of the DNA binding domain of P09874 . In all cases , P09874 inhibition leads to suppressed poly-ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins , prevention of NAD(+) depletion and significant resistance against taxol induced caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death . Paclitaxel induced a moderate increase in Akt activation , which was significantly augmented by PARP inhibition , suggesting that PARP inhibition-induced Akt activation could be responsible for the cytostatic resistance . When activation of the P19957 -kinase-Akt pathway was prevented by LY-294002 or Akt Inhibitor IV , the cytoprotective effect of PARP inhibition was significantly diminished showing that the activation of P19957 -kinase-Akt cascade had significantly contributed to the cytostatic resistance . Our study demonstrates that drug-induced drug resistance can be responsible for the reduced efficacy of antitumor treatment . Although inhibition of P09874 can promote cell death in tumor cells by the inhibition of DNA repair , PARP-inhibition promoted activation of the P19957 -kinase-Akt pathway can counteract this facilitating effect , and can cause cytostatic resistance . We suggest augmenting PARP inhibition by the inhibition of the P19957 -kinase-Akt pathway for antitumor therapy .
