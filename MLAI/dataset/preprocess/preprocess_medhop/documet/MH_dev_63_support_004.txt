Involvement of transcription factor P24468 in human trophoblast differentiation . BACKGROUND : During the in vitro differentiation of human villous cytotrophoblast ( Q01459 ) cells to a syncytiotrophoblast ( STB ) phenotype , mRNA levels for the nuclear hormone receptor P24468 ( P24468 , COUP-TFII ) increase rapidly , reaching a peak at day 1 of differentiation that is 8.8-fold greater than that in undifferentiated Q01459 cells . To examine whether P24468 is involved in the regulation of villous Q01459 cell differentiation , studies were performed to determine whether P24468 regulates the expression of P05549 ( AP-2alpha ) , a transcription factor that is critical for the terminal differentiation of these cells to a STB phenotype . METHODOLOGY/PRIMARY FINDINGS : Overexpression of P24468 in primary cultures of human Q01459 cells and JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells induced dose-dependent increases in P05549 promoter activity . Conversely , siRNA mediated silencing of the P24468 gene in villous Q01459 undergoing spontaneous differentiation blocked the induction of the mRNAs for P05549 and several STB cell specific marker genes , including human placental lactogen ( hPL ) , pregnancy specific glycoprotein 1 ( P11464 ) and corticotropin releasing hormone ( P06850 ) by 51-59 % . The induction of P05549 promoter activity by P24468 was potentiated by the nuclear hormone receptors retinoic acid receptor alpha ( P10276 ) and retinoid X receptor alpha ( P19793 ) . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : Taken together , these results strongly suggest that P24468 is involved in villous Q01459 cell differentiation and that P24468 acts , at least in part , by directly activating P05549 gene expression and by potentiating the transactivation of P05549 by P10276 and P19793 .
