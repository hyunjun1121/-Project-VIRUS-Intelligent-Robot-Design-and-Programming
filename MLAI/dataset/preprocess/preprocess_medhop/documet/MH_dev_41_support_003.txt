Purification and characterization of heterogeneous pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell populations expressing high levels of c-kit receptor . Mouse pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells ( PHSC ) were fractionated based on size and density using counterflow centrifugal elutriation ( CCE ) . These heterogeneous PHSC populations were further enriched by subtraction of cells with lineage-specific markers ( Lin- ) followed by positive sorting for c-kit expression . The cells were characterized for their functional and biochemical properties . We defined a subpopulation of c-kit-positive cells that expressed high numbers of c-kit receptors ( c-kitBR ) . One hundred c-kitBR cells from either low- or higher-density fractions were sufficient to repopulate the lymphohematopoietic system in WBB6F1-W/Wv ( W/Wv ) recipients , whereas no PHSC were found in cells with low ( c-kitDULL ) or no ( c-kitNEG ) c-kit expression . Lin- c-kitBR cells were separated into RhoDULL and RhoBR subsets based on their ability to efflux rhodamine 123 ( Rho ) . The PHSC were concentrated in Lin- c-kitBR RhoDULL cells and the number of Lin- c-kitBR RhoBR cells correlated directly with the number of day 12 colony-forming unit-spleen ( CFU- P28222 ) in each fraction . We were not able to enrich further for PHSC using monoclonal antibodies to the cell-surface markers AA4.1 or P01730 , which have been used by others to isolate PHSC . The small , low-density Lin- c-kitBR subset contained PHSC and few CFU- P28222 . This enabled us to assay PHSC for expression of the flk-2 gene , which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor present on fetal liver PHSC . Purified RNA from the low-density Lin- c-kitBR subset did not contain flk-2 mRNA . We suggest that AA4.1 , P01730 and flk-2 are expressed as stage-specific markers on PHSC in cell cycle .
