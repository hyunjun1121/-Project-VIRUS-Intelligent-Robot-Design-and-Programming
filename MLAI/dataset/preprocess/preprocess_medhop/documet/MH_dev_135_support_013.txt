DB00563 induces apoptosis through p53/ P38936 -dependent pathway and increases P12830 expression through downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 . DB00563 ( MTX ) is a dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitor widely used as an anticancer drug in different kinds of human cancers . Here we investigated the anti-tumor mechanism of MTX against non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) A549 cells . MTX not only inhibited in vitro cell growth via induction of apoptosis , but also inhibited tumor formation in animal xenograft model . RNase protection assay ( RPA ) and RT-PCR demonstrated its induction of p53 target genes including DR5 , P38936 , Puma and Noxa . Moreover , MTX promoted p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and acetylaion at Lys373/382 , which increase its stability and expression . The apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability induced by MTX were dependent on p53 and , partially , on P38936 . In addition , MTX also increased P12830 expression through inhibition of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity and downregulation of polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 ( Q15910 ) . Therefore , the anticancer mechanism of MTX acts through initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis and restoration of P12830 expression by downregulation of HDAC/ Q15910 .
