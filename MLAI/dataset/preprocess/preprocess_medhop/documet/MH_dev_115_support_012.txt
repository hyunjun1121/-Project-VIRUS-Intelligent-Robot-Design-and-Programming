Role of the JAK- P35610 pathway in protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury . The Janus kinase ( JAK ) -signal transducers and activators of transcription ( P35610 ) pathway is a stress-responsive mechanism that transduces signals from the cell surface to the nucleus , thereby modulating gene expression . Recent studies have demonstrated that myocardial ischemia and reperfusion induce rapid activation of this pathway . Although the functional consequences of this event remain to be elucidated , there is emerging evidence that JAK- P35610 signaling plays an important role in the development of the cardioprotected phenotype associated with ischemic preconditioning . Specifically , brief episodes of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion activate P23458 and O60674 , followed by recruitment of P42224 and P40763 , resulting in transcriptional upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , which then mediate the infarct-sparing effects of the late phase of preconditioning . The present review focuses on this novel cardioprotective role of JAK- P35610 signaling and on its potential exploitation for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting ischemia/reperfusion injury .
