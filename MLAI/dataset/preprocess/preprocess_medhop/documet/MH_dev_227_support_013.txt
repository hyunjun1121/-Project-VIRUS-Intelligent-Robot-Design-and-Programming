L-tryptophan-mediated enhancement of susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin . Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases . L-tryptophan and its metabolite serotonin are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation . However , it is unclear whether L-tryptophan promotes hepatic steatosis . To explore this issue , we examined the role of L-tryptophan in mouse hepatic steatosis by using a high fat and high fructose diet ( HFHFD ) model . L-tryptophan treatment in combination with an HFHFD exacerbated hepatic steatosis , expression of HNE-modified proteins , hydroxyproline content , and serum alanine aminotransaminase levels , whereas L-tryptophan alone did not result in these effects . We also found that L-tryptophan treatment increases serum serotonin levels . The introduction of adenoviral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase , which stimulates the serotonin synthesis from L-tryptophan , aggravated hepatic steatosis induced by the HFHFD . The fatty acid-induced accumulation of lipid was further increased by serotonin treatment in cultured hepatocytes . These results suggest that L-tryptophan increases the sensitivity to hepatic steatosis through serotonin production . Furthermore , L-tryptophan treatment , adenoviral P20711 introduction , and serotonin treatment induced phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) , and a potent P42345 inhibitor rapamycin attenuated hepatocyte lipid accumulation induced by fatty acid with serotonin . These results suggest the importance of P42345 activation for the exacerbation of hepatic steatosis . In conclusion , L-tryptophan exacerbates hepatic steatosis induced by HFHFD through serotonin-mediated activation of P42345 .
