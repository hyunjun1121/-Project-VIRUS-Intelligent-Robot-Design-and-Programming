c-Src modulates estrogen-induced stress and apoptosis in estrogen-deprived breast cancer cells . The emergence of anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is an important clinical phenomenon affecting long-term survival in this disease . Identifying factors that convey cell survival in this setting may guide improvements in treatment . Estrogen ( E2 ) can induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells that have been selected for survival after E2 deprivation for long periods ( MCF-7:5C cells ) , but the mechanisms underlying E2-induced stress in this setting have not been elucidated . Here , we report that the c-Src kinase functions as a key adapter protein for the estrogen receptor ( ER , P03372 ) in its activation of stress responses induced by E2 in MCF-7:5C cells . E2 elevated phosphorylation of c-Src , which was blocked by 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) , suggesting that E2 activated c-Src through the ER . We found that E2 activated the sensors of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) , IRE1α ( O75460 ) and Q9NZJ5 kinase ( Q9NZJ5 ) , the latter of which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α ( eIF2α ) . E2 also dramatically increased reactive oxygen species production and upregulated expression of heme oxygenase P09601 ( P09601 ) , an indicator of oxidative stress , along with the central energy sensor kinase AMPK ( P54646 ) . Pharmacologic or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of c-Src abolished the phosphorylation of eIF2α and AMPK , blocked E2-induced ROS production , and inhibited E2-induced apoptosis . Together , our results establish that c-Src kinase mediates stresses generated by E2 in long-term E2-deprived cells that trigger apoptosis . This work offers a mechanistic rationale for a new approach in the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancer .
