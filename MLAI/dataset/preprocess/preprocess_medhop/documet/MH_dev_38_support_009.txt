Type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors modulate the function of the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor and cell differentiation in murine growth plate chondrocytes . Extracellular calcium-sensing receptors ( CaRs ) and metabotropic or type B gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors ( GABA-B-Rs ) , two closely related members of family C of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily , dimerize in the formation of signaling and membrane-anchored receptor complexes . We tested whether CaRs and two GABA-B-R subunits ( Q96GN5 and R2 ) are expressed in mouse growth plate chondrocytes ( GPCs ) by PCR and immunocytochemistry and whether interactions between these receptors influence the expression and function of the CaR and extracellular Ca(2+)-mediated cell differentiation . Both CaRs and the Q9UBS5 and -R2 were expressed in the same zones of the growth plate and extensively colocalized in intracellular compartments and on the membranes of cultured GPCs . The Q9UBS5 co-immunoprecipitated with the CaR , confirming a physical interaction between the two receptors in GPCs . In vitro knockout of Q9UBS5 genes , using a Cre-lox recombination strategy , blunted the ability of high extracellular Ca(2+) concentration to activate phospholipase C and P27361 /2 , suppressed cell proliferation , and enhanced apoptosis in cultured GPCs . In GPCs , in which the Q9UBS5 was acutely knocked down , there was reduced expression of early chondrocyte markers , aggrecan and type II collagen , and increased expression of the late differentiation markers , type X collagen and osteopontin . These results support the idea that physical interactions between CaRs and GABA-B-R1s modulate the growth and differentiation of GPCs , potentially by altering the function of CaRs .
