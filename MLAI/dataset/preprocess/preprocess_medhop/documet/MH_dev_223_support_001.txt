Expression and purification of cytokine receptor homology domain of human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor fusion protein in Escherichia coli . Direct expression of the cytokine receptor homology ( P06850 ) domain of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) receptor is lethal to Escherichia coli . For the efficient and stable production of an active P06850 domain in E. coli , we fused the P06850 domain with different proteins , such as maltose-binding protein ( MalE ) , glutathione S-transferase , and thioredoxin ( P10599 ) . Among these , P10599 appeared to be the best in terms of the protein expression level , purification efficiency by affinity chromatography , and binding activity to its ligand , DB00099 . The yield of active P10599 - P06850 fusion protein increased about 200-fold compared to that of previously reported MalE- P06850 fusion .
