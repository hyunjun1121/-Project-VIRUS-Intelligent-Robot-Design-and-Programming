Age-related changes in rat bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cell plasticity . BACKGROUND : The efficacy of adult stem cells is known to be compromised as a function of age . This therefore raises questions about the effectiveness of autologous cell therapy in elderly patients . RESULTS : We demonstrated that the expression profile of stemness markers was altered in BM-MSCs derived from old rats . BM-MSCs from young rats ( 4 months ) expressed Q01860 , Sox-2 and Q9H9S0 , but we failed to detect Sox-2 and Q9H9S0 in BM-MSCs from older animals ( 15 months ) . Chondrogenic , osteogenic and adipogenic potential is compromised in old BM-MSCs . Stimulation with a cocktail mixture of bone morphogenetic protein ( P12643 ) , fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) and insulin-like growth factor ( DB01277 ) induced cardiomyogenesis in young BM-MSCs but not old BM-MSCs . Significant differences in the expression of gap junction protein connexin-43 were observed between young and old BM-MSCs . Young and old BM-MSCs fused with neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes in co-culture and expressed key cardiac transcription factors and structural proteins . Cells from old animals expressed significantly lower levels of P15692 , IGF , P01133 , and DB00099 . Significantly higher levels of DNA double strand break marker Î³- P16104 and diminished levels of telomerase activity were observed in old BM-MSCs . CONCLUSION : The results suggest age related differences in the differentiation capacity of BM-MSCs . These changes may affect the efficacy of BM-MSCs for use in stem cell therapy .
