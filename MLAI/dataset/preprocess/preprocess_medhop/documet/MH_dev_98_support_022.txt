P14210 suppresses the anticancer effect of irinotecan by decreasing the level of active metabolite in HepG2 cells . In the liver , carboxylesterase ( CES ) converts irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) to its active metabolite SN-38 , which exerts anticancer effects . SN-38 is metabolized to an inactive metabolite SN-38 glucuronide by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( P22309 ) . Therefore , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of the P22309 gene are responsible for the severe adverse effects associated with the disruption of SN-38 metabolism . However , despite having SNPs of the P22309 gene , many patients metabolize SN-38 sufficiently to avoid severe adverse effects . Among these patients , we found individuals with elevated serum concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) . The aim of this study was to evaluate whether P14210 alters the metabolism of CPT-11 , resulting in a reduction in the anticancer effect of CPT11 . The cytotoxicity of CPT-11 and SN-38 was evaluated in HepG2 cells pretreated with P14210 . Furthermore , we explored the level of expression and mechanisms of activity of CES and P22309 . P14210 suppressed the cytotoxicity of CPT-11 by decreasing intracellular SN-38 levels that resulted from a decrease in CES2 and an increase in P22309 . Furthermore , this P14210 -induced suppression was improved by pretreatment with an inhibitor of P08581 c- DB00134 , and the improvement was synergistically potentiated by epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitors . Moreover , P14210 induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and transactivated P00533 . These results suggest that P14210 is a possible causative agent of acquired clinical resistance in chemotherapy with CPT-11 and could be useful as a predictor of clinical resistance . Additional treatment using c- DB00134 and/or P00533 inhibitors could be a novel strategy to overcome resistance .
