Circulating apoptotic proteins are increased in long-term disease-free breast cancer survivors . Circulating apoptotic proteins are increased in patients with heart failure . We evaluated whether circulating soluble ( s ) apoptosis-related proteins and inflammation markers are increased in long-term disease free breast cancer survivors and associated with cardiotoxicity , and if subgroups could be identified based on the applied treatments . Circulating tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) alpha , sTNF-receptor ( sTNF-R ) 1 and 2 , sFas , sFas ligand , sTNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand ( sTRAIL ) and serum P04626 were measured with immunoassay . High-sensitivity P02741 ( HS-CRP ) , fibrinogen , plasma B-type and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide ( NT- P01160 and DB04899 ) were also determined . Thirty-four patients with median 6.0 years follow-up and 12 healthy age-matched women were enrolled . Chemotherapy , consisting of five cycles fluorouracil , epirubicin ( 90 mg/m(2) ) , cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) ( n=14 ) or four cycles FEC followed by myeloablation with high-dose carboplatin , cyclophosphamide , thiotepa ( n=20 ) , preceded irradiation and tamoxifen . Circulating apoptosis markers were higher in patients than in controls . No associations with cardiac dysfunction were observed . sFas ligand and sTRAIL were higher in the high-dose than in the standard-dose group . In conclusion , we observed increased circulating apoptotic protein levels in long-term disease-free breast cancer survivors , treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy , particularly after myeloablative chemotherapy . The potential relation with late cardiotoxicity of antineoplastic therapy deserves further study .
