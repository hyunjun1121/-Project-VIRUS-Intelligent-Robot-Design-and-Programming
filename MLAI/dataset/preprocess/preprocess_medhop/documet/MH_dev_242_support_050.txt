Evidence that 5-HT2c receptor antagonists are anxiolytic in the rat Geller-Seifter model of anxiety . Four non-selective P28335 /5- Q13049 receptor antagonists , mianserin ( 2-8 mg/kg ) , 1-naphthyl piperazine ( 1-NP ) ( 0.5-1 mg/kg ) , ICI 169,369 ( 20 mg/kg ) and LY 53857 ( 5 mg/kg ) , increased punished responding for a food reward in the rat Geller-Seifter test 30 min after subcutaneous ( SC ) administration . This property was shared by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide ( 5 mg/kg SC ) . However , the selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonists ketanserin ( 0. P35326 mg/kg SC ) and altanserin ( 0.5 , 1 mg/kg SC ) had little effect . The P08908 , P28222 and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists pindolol and cyanopindolol ( 6 mg/kg SC ) did not affect punished responding either , nor did the P28221 receptor partial agonist and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine ( 2.5 mg/kg SC ) or the histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine ( 1 mg/kg SC ) . Unpunished responding was also modestly increased after some doses of the P28335 /5- Q13049 receptor antagonists . However , this effect was inconsistent and was also seen after chlordiazepoxide . Furthermore , it was not associated with the increase in punished responding observed in rats orally treated with mianserin ( 10 , 20 mg/kg ) , 1-NP ( 10 , 20 mg/kg ) or ICI 169,369 ( 50 mg/kg ) . The action of the P28335 /5- Q13049 receptor antagonists tested is therefore consistent with anxiolysis . The results also strongly suggest that this effect is mediated by blockade of the P28335 receptor , although the possibility of P41595 receptor mediation is discussed .
