[ Differentially expressed proteins in the precancerous stage of rat hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine ] . OBJECTIVE : To screen the differentially expressed proteins especially at the precancerous stage of diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) induced hepatocarcinogenesis by comparative proteome research . METHODS : Rats were divided into normal and DEN groups and sacrificed periodically . The liver samples were stained with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( P19440 ) and HE to distinguish the preneoplastic lesion ( pre-HCC ) from the normal and HCC tissues . The two-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2-DE ) and mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF-MS/MS ) were then applied to analyze the differentially expressed protein between pre-HCC and normal tissues , pre-HCC and HCC , as well as HCC and normal tissues . A few of the candidate proteins such as laminin receptor 1 ( P08865 ) and agmatinase were validated by Western blot and RT-PCR . RESULTS : Totally , there were 82 proteins that differentially expressed two fold or more in one kind of tissues sample than the other , 47 of which occurred in the pre-HCC tissues . Eight proteins including P08865 were consistently up-regulated from normal tissue to pre-HCC and then to HCC tissues , while 22 proteins including agmatinase showed progressively down-regulated in these tissues samples . CONCLUSION : The protein expression profiles are different during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis . Further study on the differentially expressed protein , especially these upregulated in the precancerous stage such as P08865 and agmatinase , might contribute to prevention and early diagnosis of human HCC .
