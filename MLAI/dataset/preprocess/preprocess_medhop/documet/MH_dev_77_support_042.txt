DB00368 inhibits exocytosis via the G protein βγ subunit and refilling of the readily releasable granule pool via the α(i1/2) subunit . The molecular mechanisms responsible for the ' distal ' effect by which noradrenaline ( NA ) blocks exocytosis in the β-cell were examined by whole-cell and cell-attached patch clamp capacitance measurements in P01308 832/13 β-cells . NA inhibited Ca(2+)-evoked exocytosis by reducing the number of exocytotic events , without modifying vesicle size . Fusion pore properties also were unaffected . NA-induced inhibition of exocytosis was abolished by a high level of Ca(2+) influx , by intracellular application of antibodies against the G protein subunit Gβ and was mimicked by the myristoylated βγ-binding/activating peptide mSIRK . NA-induced inhibition was also abolished by treatment with DB00083 , which cleaves the C-terminal nine amino acids of P60880 , and also by a P60880 C-terminal-blocking peptide containing the DB00083 cleavage site . These data indicate that inhibition of exocytosis by NA is downstream of increased [Ca(2+)](i) and is mediated by an interaction between Gβγ and the C-terminus of P60880 , as is the case for inhibition of neurotransmitter release . Remarkably , in the course of this work , a novel effect of NA was discovered . NA induced a marked retardation of the rate of refilling of the readily releasable pool ( O75783 ) of secretory granules . This retardation was specifically abolished by a Gα(i1/2) blocking peptide demonstrating that the effect is mediated via activation of Gα(i1) and/or Gα(i2) .
