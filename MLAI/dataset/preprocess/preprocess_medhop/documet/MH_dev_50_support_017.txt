P13569 modulates neurosecretory function in pulmonary neuroendocrine cell-related tumor cell line models . The pulmonary neuroendocrine cell ( PNEC ) system consists of solitary cells and distinctive cell clusters termed neuroepithelial bodies ( P20929 ) localized in the airway epithelium . PNEC/ P20929 express a variety of bioactive substances , including amine ( serotonin , 5HT ) and neuropeptides . We have previously shown that P20929 cells are O(2) sensors expressing nicotinamide adenine diphosphate oxidase complex and O(2) sensitive K(+) channel . Recently , we demonstrated expression of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) and Cl(-) conductances in P20929 cells of rabbit neonatal lung . Because PNEC/ P20929 are sparsely distributed and difficult to study in native lung , we investigated small-cell lung carcinoma ( SCLC ) and carcinoid tumor cell lines ( tumor counterparts of normal PNEC/ P20929 ) as models for PNEC/ P20929 . SCLC ( H146 , H345 ) and carcinoid ( H727 ) cell lines express neuroendocrine cell markers , including chromogranin A , neural cell adhesion molecule ( N- P62158 ) , 5HT , and tryptophan hydroxylase . We report that H146 , H345 , and H727 express P13569 messenger RNA ( reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ) and protein ( immunoblotting ) and possess functional P13569 Cl(-) conductance , demonstrated by an iodide efflux assay inhibitable by transfection with antisense P13569 . Using an immunoassay to quantitate 5HT secretion , we also show that downregulation of P13569 abolishes hypoxia-induced 5HT release , and reduces secretory response to high potassium . Our findings suggest that P13569 may modulate neurosecretory activity of PNEC/ P20929 possessing O(2) sensor function . We propose that these tumor cell lines may be useful models for investigating the role of P13569 in PNEC/ P20929 functions in health and disease .
