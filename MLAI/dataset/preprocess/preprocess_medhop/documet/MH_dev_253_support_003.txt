P16070 -mediated cyclooxygenase-2 expression and thromboxane A2 production in RAW 264.7 macrophages . OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN : P16070 is the major cell surface receptor for hyaluronan ( HA ) on macrophages . Stimulation of macrophages via the HA- P16070 pathway leads to the enhanced expression of inflammatory gene products , including cytokines , chemokines , and adhesion molecules . We have examined whether activation of P16070 by crosslinking is capable of activating the cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) and prostaglandin ( PG ) /thromboxane ( TX ) pathway in cultured macrophages . MATERIALS AND METHODS : P16070 was crosslinked on RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages using specific rat anti-mouse P16070 monoclonal antibodies and anti-rat IgG . Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR analysis for genes of the PG/TX synthetic pathway . Supernatants were analyzed for DB00917 and TXB2 using specific ELISAs . RESULTS : Transcripts for P23219 , P35354 , TX synthase ( P24557 ) , and DB00917 synthase ( O14684 ) were all constitutively expressed in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 . Crosslinking of P16070 markedly enhanced P35354 and weakly increased P24557 mRNA , whereas P23219 and O14684 mRNA did not change significantly in these cells . Crosslinking of P16070 selectively increased the production of TXB2 but not DB00917 . CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that the activation of the P16070 pathway plays a unique role in PG synthesis . Activation of this pathway results in enhanced TXA2 but not DB00917 production . This leads to an imbalance of the TXA2/ DB00917 profile which favors a proinflammatory and vasoconstrictory response .
