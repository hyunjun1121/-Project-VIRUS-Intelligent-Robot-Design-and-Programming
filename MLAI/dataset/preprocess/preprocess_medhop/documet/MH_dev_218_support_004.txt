Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 as a key signaling pathway in normal mammary gland developmental biology and breast cancer . P42229 consists of two proteins , P42229 /B , that impact mammary cell differentiation , proliferation , and survival . In normal development , P42229 expression and activity are regulated by prolactin signaling with O60674 / Q9UKW6 , P01133 signaling networks that include c-Src , and growth hormone , insulin growth factor , estrogen , and progesterone signaling pathways . In cancer , erythropoietin signaling can also regulate P42229 . Activation levels are influenced by AKT , caveolin , Q99490 -A , Pak1 , c-Myb , Brk , beta-integrin , dystroglycan , other STATs , and P35610 pathway molecules P23458 , Q06124 , and Q9NSE2 . TGF-Î² and P43378 can downregulate prolactin- and P01133 -mediated P42229 activation , respectively . IGF , AKT , O14788 , cyclin D1 , P41182 , and P07900 lie downstream of P42229 .
