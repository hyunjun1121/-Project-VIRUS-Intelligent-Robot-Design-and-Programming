miRNA-regulated expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the cisplatin-inhibited growth of K562 cells . To explore the mechanism of apoptosis induced by cisplatin , the expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and regulating genes in K562 cells was analyzed using reverse transcription PCR , quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . Our results showed that miR-16 , miR-34a-c , miR-17-5p and miR-125 were up-regulated , and their associated oncogenes ( P10415 , Q01094 and O00716 , respectively ) were down-regulated after cisplatin treatment . We also showed that miR-106 and miR-150 were down-regulated while their target genes ( P06400 and P04637 , respectively ) were up-regulated after cisplatin treatment . Moreover , miR-16 , miR-34a-c and miR-17-5p proved to be upstream factors , regulating the expression of P10415 , Q01094 and O00716 , respectively . The oncogene O00716 was down-regulated when P06400 expression was increased after treatment with antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) . Similarly , P10415 and O00716 were down-regulated when P04637 expression was elevated by ASO treatment . The study demonstrated that cisplatin induces K562 cells to apoptosis by reducing miR-106 which up-regulates P06400 or by inhibiting miR-150 which increases P04637 expression .
