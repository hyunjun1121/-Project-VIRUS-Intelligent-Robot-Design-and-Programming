Targeting the P04626 receptor in metastatic breast cancer . The advent of targeted therapies has revolutionized the treatment of certain types of cancer . Identification of molecular targets on cancer cells has led to the design of novel drugs , which either used as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy , has prolonged survival in metastatic disease , or contributed to curative treatment in the adjuvant setting . A literature review was conducted to identify and present current knowledge on the molecular function of the P04626 receptor , its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and anti- P04626 targeted drugs in use or under development . Many molecular targets have been identified in breast cancer , with the HER family of receptors being the ones most extensively studied . DB00072 and lapatinib target the P04626 receptor and are approved drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Several other targeted agents , including DB05773 , pertuzumab , neratinib , afatinib and ertumaxomab , are currently being tested in vivo as well as in clinical studies . The use of targeted therapies in metastatic breast cancer has improved prognosis , increased survival and dramatically changed the way we treat breast cancer patients today .
