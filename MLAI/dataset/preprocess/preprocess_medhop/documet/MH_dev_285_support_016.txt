Identification of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor-specific T cells in Graves ' disease thyroid using autoantigen-transfected Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines . The importance of thyrotropin receptor ( P16473 ) agonist antibodies in the manifestations of Graves ' disease ( GD ) is recognized . There are , however , no convincing reports of P16473 -specific T cells . We have previously cloned T cells specific for thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase ( P07202 ) from GD lymphoid infiltrates and used autologous EBV-transformed B cell lines ( EBVL ) transfected with an expression vector encoding P07202 to efficiently detect P07202 -specific T cells . Here we used EBVL transfected with P16473 to seek P16473 -specific T cells in the GD infiltrates , after cloning the in vivo activated T cells without antigen . 3 out of 30 clones responded vigorously and reproducibly to EBVL- P16473 , with a mean stimulation index > 7 . Their release of P60568 , P05112 , and P22301 after stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 and phorbol ester was indistinguishable from the other clones from this thyroid . However , they produced relatively little IFN gamma ( median P05112 /IFN gamma ratio of 0.80 ) compared with the other clones ( median P05112 /IFN gamma ratio 0.06 ) . Thus , this new potent method of antigen presentation , using autoantigen-transfected EBVL , has permitted the first unequivocal identification of P16473 T cells in GD thyroid , with distinct Th0/Th2 characteristics , unlike previously cloned P07202 -responsive cells which have Th1 characteristics .
