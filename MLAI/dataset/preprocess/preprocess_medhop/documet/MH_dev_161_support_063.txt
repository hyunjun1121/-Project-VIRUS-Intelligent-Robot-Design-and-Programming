Selective JAK/ P40763 signalling regulates transcription of colony stimulating factor-2 and -3 in Concanavalin-A-activated mesenchymal stromal cells . Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) express Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and produce cytokines and chemokines , all of which contribute to these cells ' immunomodulatory and proangiogenic properties . Among the secreted cytokines , colony-stimulating factors ( CSFs ) regulate angiogenesis through activation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration . Since O60682 are recruited within hypoxic tumors where they signal paracrine-regulated angiogenesis , the aim of this study was to evaluate which P04141 members are expressed and are inducible in activated O60682 . Furthermore , we investigated the JAK/ P35610 signal transducing pathway that may impact on P04141 transcription . O60682 were activated with Concanavalin-A ( ConA ) , a TLR-2/6 agonist as well as a membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) inducer , and we found increased transcription of granulocyte macrophage- P04141 ( GM- P04141 , P04141 -2 ) , granulocyte P04141 ( DB00099 , P04141 -3 ) , and P50281 . Gene silencing of either P40763 or P50281 prevented ConA-induced phosphorylation of P40763 , and reversed ConA effects on P04141 -2 and P04141 -3 . Treatment with the Janus Kinase (JAK)2 inhibitor AG490 antagonized the ConA induction of P50281 and P04141 -2 , while the pan-JAK inhibitor DB08895 reversed ConA-induced P04141 -2 and -3 gene expression . Silencing of O60674 prevented the ConA-mediated increase of P04141 -2 , while silencing of P23458 , P52333 and P29597 prevented the increase in P04141 -3 . Given that combined TLR-activation and locally-produced P04141 -2 and P04141 -3 could regulate immunomodulation and neovascularization , pharmacological targeting of TLR-2/6-induced P50281 /JAK/ P40763 signalling pathway may prevent O60682 contribution to tumor development .
