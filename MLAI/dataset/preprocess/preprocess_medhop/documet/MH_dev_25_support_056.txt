DB01197 and lisinopril suppress production of interleukin-12 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) inhibitors have immunomodulatory functions and can suppress a number of proinflammatory , monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines . Interleukin-12 is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages , which plays an essential role in cell mediated immunity and stimulates the development of T helper type 1 immune responses . In this study , we investigated the ability of P12821 inhibitors , captopril and lisinopril , to suppress IL-12 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . We show that both P12821 inhibitors significantly inhibit production of IL-12 by PBMC stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan ( Q96PN6 ) . Although both P12821 inhibitors also suppressed P01579 production by human anti-CD3/anti- P10747 -stimulated T-cells , the addition of exogenous P01579 to the PBMC stimulation medium does not abrogate the ability of P12821 inhibitors to suppress IL-12 production . Inhibition of IL-12 was not associated with inhibition of IL-1beta , but correlated with the suppression of P12821 . Therefore , suppression of IL-12 may contribute to the immunomodulatory effect of P12821 inhibitors and may be responsible for the beneficial effect of captopril and other P12821 inhibitors in inflammatory or autoimmune conditions in which IL-12 is involved .
