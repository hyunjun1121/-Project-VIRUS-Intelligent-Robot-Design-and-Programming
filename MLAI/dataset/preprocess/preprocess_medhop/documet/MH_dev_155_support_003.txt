mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis underlying rapid antidepressant effect requires GABABR signaling . Administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors ( NMDAR ) antagonists initiates a rapid anti-depressant response requiring mammalian Target of DB00877 Complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) kinase ; however the molecular mechanism is unknown . We have determined that upon NMDAR blockade , dendritic Î³-amino-butyric acid B receptors ( GABABR ) facilitate dendritic calcium entry . The GABABR-mediated increase in calcium signal requires the availability of dendritic L-type calcium channels . Moreover , GABABR can activate P42345 and increase P42345 dependent expression of P23560 under the same NMDAR blocked conditions . In vivo , blocking GABABR prevents the fast-acting , anti-depressant effect of the Q13224 antagonist , Ro-25-6891 , decreases active mTORC1 kinase , and reduces expression of P23560 and the AMPA receptor subunit P42261 . These findings propose a novel role for GABABRs in the antidepressant action of Q13224 antagonists and as an initiator/regulator of mTORC1-mediated translation .
