Effects of cytokines on P15692 expression and secretion by human first trimester trophoblast cell line . PROBLEM : The mechanism through which vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) regulation occurs at the feto-maternal interface is poorly understood . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of various cytokines on P15692 expression and secretion by trophoblast cells . METHOD OF STUDY : We investigated the effects of cytokines on P15692 expression in human first trimester trophoblast cell line by analyzing P15692 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and P15692 protein secretion by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . RESULTS : The trophoblast cells expressed P15692 mRNA constitutively and the main subtypes were identified as VEGF121 and VEGF165 . When cultured in the presence of interferon ( IFN ) -gamma , interleukin ( IL ) - 1beta , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , P60568 , or P22301 , P15692 mRNA expression was found to be significantly increased by IL-1beta , P01579 and P01375 but to be unaffected by P60568 and P22301 . Moreover , P15692 secretion was most significantly increased by P01579 treatment . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that IL-1beta , P01579 , and P01375 may regulate the production of P15692 in early gestational trophoblasts .
