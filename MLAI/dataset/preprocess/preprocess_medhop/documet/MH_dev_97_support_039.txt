Statins exhibit anticancer effects through modifications of the pAkt signaling pathway . Statins are cholesterol lowering drugs that exhibit antitumor effects in several in vitro and in vivo models , and epidemiological studies indicate that statins prevent cancer . However , the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of statins still needs to be elucidated . We previously demonstrated that single doses of different statins rapidly affect Akt signaling via the purinergic receptor Q99572 . In particular , statins down-regulated nuclear pAkt . Here , we report that long-term treatment of A549 cells with high concentrations of statins ( 15-75 µM ) selects cell sub-populations exhibiting altered P2X receptor expression , signs of increased P60484 activity , enhanced Q6ZVD8 , decreased PI3K p110β and inhibited downstream pAkt signaling . Furthermore , the nuclear accumulation of pAkt in response to insulin was inhibited in selected cells . Statin-selected cells displayed reduced proliferation rate and were more vulnerable to etoposide- and 5-fluorouracil-elicited cytotoxic effects . The stability of a selected phenotype ( 50 µM ) was tested for three weeks in the absence of statins . This resulted in a reversal of some , but not all alterations . Importantly , the truncated nuclear insulin response was retained . We conclude that long-term treatment with high doses of statins selects cells exhibiting stable alterations in insulin-Akt signaling and which are vulnerable to DNA damage . Our studies strengthen the hypothesis that an altered Akt signaling has a role in chemopreventive effects of statins .
