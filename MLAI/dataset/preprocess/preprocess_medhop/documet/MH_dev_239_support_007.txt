Discovery and optimization of sulfonyl acrylonitriles as selective , covalent inhibitors of protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 . The serine hydrolase protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 ( Q9Y570 ) regulates the methylesterification state of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) and has been implicated in cancer and Alzheimer 's disease . We recently reported a fluorescence polarization-activity-based protein profiling ( fluopol- P05067 ) high-throughput screen for Q9Y570 that uncovered a remarkably potent and selective class of aza-Î²-lactam ( P00519 ) Q9Y570 inhibitors . Here , we describe a distinct set of sulfonyl acrylonitrile inhibitors that also emerged from this screen . The optimized compound , 28 ( AMZ30 ) , selectively inactivates Q9Y570 and reduces the demethylated form of PP2A in living cells . Considering that 28 is structurally unrelated to P00519 inhibitors of Q9Y570 , these agents , together , provide a valuable set of pharmacological probes to study the role of methylation in regulating PP2A function . We furthermore observed that several serine hydrolases were sensitive to analogues of 28 , suggesting that more extensive structural exploration of the sulfonyl acrylonitrile chemotype may result in useful inhibitors for other members of this large enzyme class .
