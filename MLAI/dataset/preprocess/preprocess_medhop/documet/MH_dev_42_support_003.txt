[ Bone metastasis in prostate cancer ] . Bone metastasis and skeletal complications have a devastating impact on the quality of life and are a major cause of morbidity in prostate cancer patients . In addition to established bone-targeted therapies , new drugs such as endothelin A receptor antagonists , MET and P35968 antagonists or radiopharmaceuticals are in the focus of development . The standard care in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases to prevent skeletal-related events ( SRE ) are bisphosphonates . DB06643 , a human monoclonal antibody against O14788 , appeared to be superior to zoledronic acid for prevention of SRE and has been shown to prolong bone metastases-free survival . In contrast to zoledronic acid , denosumab clearance is not dependent on kidney function and can be administered subcutaneously . Similar rates of toxicity were observed for both substances ; however , long-term data for denosumab are limited .
