DB00065 for treating axial spondylarthropathy in everyday practice . The advent of P01375 antagonists has had a revolutionary impact on the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . However , whether the benefits recorded in controlled trials are replicated in everyday practice has not been extensively evaluated . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effectiveness of infliximab in patients with axial spondyloarthropathies , to identify factors associated with the treatment response , and to assess fulfillment of modified New York criteria and compliance with guidelines about using P01375 antagonists . METHODS : Retrospective review of patients given infliximab for axial spondyloarthropathy between 2001 and 2003 . Disease activity , motion limitation , laboratory tests , and the 6-week response rate were recorded . RESULTS : Of the 86 included patients ( 48 women and 38 men , mean age , 44+/-11 years ) , 37 % responded to infliximab therapy . Uveitis and P02741 elevation at baseline predicted a response . Only 53 % of patients met modified New York criteria and only 23 % met ASAS criteria for starting P01375 antagonist therapy . CONCLUSION : DB00065 was less effective in our patients with axial spondyloarthropathy than expected based on the results of controlled trials . However , many patients did not meet New York criteria for AS and/or ASAS criteria for P01375 antagonist therapy . Therefore , our results do not challenge the usefulness of P01375 antagonists in axial AS . Our patients were treated before the development of guidelines for P01375 antagonist therapy and before the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging as an evaluation tool in AS . Strict criteria should be used to decide when P01375 antagonist therapy is appropriate in patients with spondyloarthropathies .
