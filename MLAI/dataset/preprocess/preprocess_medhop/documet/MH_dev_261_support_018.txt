Effect of growth factors on nuclear and mitochondrial ADP-ribosylation processes during astroglial cell development and aging in culture . Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) , insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) and insulin ( P01308 ) are powerful mitogens and may regulate gene expression in cultured astrocytes by ADP-ribosylation process . Nuclear poly-ADP ribose polymerase ( PARP ) and mitochondrial monoADP-ribosyltransferase ( P09874 ) are the key enzymes involved in poly-ADP-ribosylation and mono ADP-ribosylation , respectively . In this investigation the effect of P01133 , P09038 , P05019 or P01308 on nuclear PARP and mitochondrial P09874 activities were assessed in nuclei and mitochondria purified from developing ( 30 DIV ) or aging ( 90 and 190 DIV ) primary rat astrocyte cultures . A marked increase of PARP activity in P09038 or P05019 treated astroglial cell cultures at 30 DIV was found . Nuclear PARP and mitochondrial P09874 activities were greatly stimulated by treatment with P01133 or P01308 alone or together in astrocyte cultures at 30 DIV . Nuclear PARP and mitochondrial P09874 activities showed a more remarkable increase in control untreated astrocyte cultures at 190 DIV than at 90 DIV . These findings suggest that ADP-ribosylation process is involved in DNA damage and repair during cell differentiation and aging in culture . Twelve hours treatment with P01133 , P01308 or P09038 significantly stimulated nuclear PARP and mitochondrial P09874 activities in 190 DIV aging astrocyte cultures . The above results indicate that P01133 , P01308 and P09038 may play a crucial role in the post-translational modification of chromosomal proteins including ADP-ribosylation process in in vitro models . This suggests that growth factors regulate genomic stability in glial cells during development and maturation , stimulating nuclear and mitochondrial ADP-ribosylation processes in developing or aging astrocyte cultures .
