Involvement of 5-HT₇ receptors in vortioxetine 's modulation of circadian rhythms and episodic memory in rodents . Since poor circadian synchrony and cognitive dysfunction have been linked to affective disorders , antidepressants that target key 5-HT ( serotonin ) receptor subtypes involved in circadian rhythm and cognitive regulation may have therapeutic utility . DB09068 is a multimodal antidepressant that inhibits P28221 , 5- Q9H205 , P34969 receptor activity , 5-HT reuptake , and enhances the activity of P08908 and P28222 receptors . In this study , we investigated the effects of vortioxetine on the period length of O15055 ::LUC expression , circadian behavior , and episodic memory , using tissue explants from genetically modified O15055 ::LUC mice , locomotor activity rhythm monitoring , and the object recognition test , respectively . Incubation of tissue explants from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of O15055 ::LUC mice with 0.1 μM vortioxetine increased the period length of O15055 bioluminescence . Monitoring of daily wheel-running activity of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with vortioxetine ( 10 mg/kg , s.c. ) , alone or in combination with the P08908 receptor agonist flesinoxan ( 2.5 mg/kg , s.c. ) or the P34969 receptor antagonist SB269970 ( 30 mg/kg , s.c. ) , just prior to activity onset revealed significant delays in wheel-running behavior . The increase in circadian period length and the phase delay produced by vortioxetine were abolished in the presence of the P34969 receptor partial agonist AS19 . Finally , in the object recognition test , vortioxetine ( 10 mg/kg , i.p. ) increased the time spent exploring the novel object during the retention test and this effect was prevented by AS19 ( 5 mg/kg , i.p. ) . In conclusion , the present study shows that vortioxetine , partly via its P34969 receptor antagonism , induced a significant effect on circadian rhythm and presented promnesic properties in rodents .
