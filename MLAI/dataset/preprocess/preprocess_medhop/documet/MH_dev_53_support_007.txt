Neuropeptide Y induces ischemic angiogenesis and restores function of ischemic skeletal muscles . Previously we showed that neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) , a sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurotransmitter , stimulates endothelial cell migration , proliferation , and differentiation in vitro . Here , we report on P01303 's actions , receptors , and mediators in ischemic angiogenesis . In rats , hindlimb ischemia stimulates sympathetic P01303 release ( attenuated by lumbar sympathectomy ) and upregulates P01303 - P28062 ( P28062 ) receptor and a peptidase forming P28062 /Y5-selective agonist . Exogenous P01303 at physiological concentrations also induces Q15761 , stimulates neovascularization , and restores ischemic muscle blood flow and performance . P01303 -mediated ischemic angiogenesis is not prevented by a selective Q03519 receptor antagonist but is reduced in P28062 (-/-) mice . Nonischemic muscle vascularity is also lower in P28062 (-/-) mice , whereas it is increased in P01303 -overexpressing rats compared with their WT controls . Ex vivo , P01303 -induced aortic sprouting is markedly reduced in P28062 (-/-) aortas and spontaneous sprouting is severely impaired in P01303 (-/-) mice . P01303 -mediated aortic sprouting , but not cell migration/proliferation , is blocked by an antifetal liver kinase 1 antibody and abolished in mice null for P29474 . Thus , P01303 mediates neurogenic ischemic angiogenesis at physiological concentrations by activating P28062 /Y5 receptors and P29474 , in part due to release of P15692 . P01303 's effectiveness in revascularization and restoring function of ischemic tissue suggests its therapeutic potential in ischemic conditions .
