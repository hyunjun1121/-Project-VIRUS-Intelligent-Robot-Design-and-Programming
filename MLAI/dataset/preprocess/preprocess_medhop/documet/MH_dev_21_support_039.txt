P00747 activation by airway smooth muscle is regulated by type I collagen . Plasmin , the activated protease product of plasminogen , is involved in collagen remodeling , and is strongly implicated in asthma pathophysiology by recent genome-wide association studies . This study examines plasminogen " activation " by airway smooth muscle cells , and its regulation in a fibrotic environment created by culture on type I collagen and incubation with transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) activity was detected in the supernatants of human airway smooth muscle cell cultures maintained in serum-free conditions . Incubation with plasminogen ( 1.5-50.0 μg/ml , 24 h ) increased plasmin activity in a concentration-dependent manner ( P < 0.001 ) . uPA activity was higher in cultures maintained on fibrillar type I collagen substrata than in those on plastic , as was plasmin activity after incubation with plasminogen ( 20 μg/ml ) . Pretreatment with TGF-β ( 100 pM ) for 18 hours inhibited plasminogen activation by airway smooth muscle cells maintained on plastic , but not on collagen . TGF-β stimulated an increase in the level of uPA mRNA in airway smooth muscle cells grown on collagen , but not on plastic . Reducing the levels of β1-integrin collagen receptor , using interference RNA , attenuated plasmin formation by airway smooth muscle cells grown on collagen , and restored the inhibitory effect of TGF-β . This study shows that airway smooth muscle activation of plasminogen by uPA is accelerated in a collagen-rich environment in which the inhibitory effect of TGF-β is attenuated in association with greater uPA expression induced via β1-integrin signaling . These findings suggest that the plasminogen-activation system involving uPA has the potential to contribute to airway wall remodeling in asthma .
