[ The effect of bunazosin vs captopril on hemodynamic and neurohumoral parameters in patients with congestive heart failure ] . The hemodynamic parameters ( right atrial pressure , mean pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , cardiac index , heart rate , blood pressure ) and neurohumoral responses ( alpha- P01160 , plasma renin activity , aldosterone , angiotensin II ) of DB01197 , oral P12821 inhibitor , and Bunazosin , oral alpha 1-blocker , were investigated in 28 patients with congestive heart failure at rest and after exercise . These data were analysed in both acute and chronic phases . 1 ) Acute effect . DB01197 produced significant improvement of neurohumoral factors at rest and also after exercise . Bunazosin reduced alpha- P01160 , but other neurohumoral factors did not change . Bunazosin produced significant hemodynamic improvement both at rest and after exercise . 2 ) Chronic effect . DB01197 produced significant hemodynamic improvement both at rest and after exercise . Improvement of neurohumoral factors in acute phase was also preserved at chronic phase . On Bunazosin , improvement of hemodynamics at acute phase was also preserved at chronic phase without deterioration of neurohumoral factors .
