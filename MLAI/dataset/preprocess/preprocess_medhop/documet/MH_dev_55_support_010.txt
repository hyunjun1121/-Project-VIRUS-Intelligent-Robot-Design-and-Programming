DB00197 and pioglitazone interactions via P37231 -independent and -dependent pathways in regulating physiological responses in renal tubule-derived cell lines . DB00197 ( Tro ) and pioglitazone ( Pio ) activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma and P37231 -independent pathways was studied in cell lines derived from porcine renal tubules . P37231 -dependent activation of Q07869 response element-driven luciferase gene expression was observed with Pio at 1 microM but not Tro at 1 microM . On the other hand , P37231 -independent P- P29323 activation was observed with 5 microM Tro but not with Pio ( 5-20 microM ) . In addition , Pio ( 1-10 microM ) increased metabolic acid production and activated AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential , whereas Tro ( 1-20 microM ) did not . These results are consistent with three pathways through which glitazones may act in effecting metabolic processes ( ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis ) as well as cellular growth : 1 ) P37231 -dependent and P37231 -independent pathways , 2 ) P- P29323 activation , and 3 ) mitochondrial AMPK activation . The pathways influence cellular acidosis and glucose and glutamine metabolism in a manner favoring reduced plasma glucose in vivo . In addition , significant interactions can be demonstrated that enhance some physiological processes ( ammoniagenesis ) and suppress others ( ligand-mediated P37231 gene expression ) . Our findings provide a model both for understanding seemingly opposite biological effects and for enhancing therapeutic potency of these agents .
