Structure functional expression and spatial distribution of a cloned cDNA encoding a rat P28221 -like receptor . Using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) a complementary DNA ( cDNA ) encoding a 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) receptor was isolated from rat forebrain . The amplified cDNA specifies an open reading frame of 374 amino acids comprising seven putative transmembrane regions . Expression of the cloned cDNA in human embryonic kidney cells ( P29320 293 ) was used to establish the pharmacological profile of the encoded receptor polypeptide . Membranes containing the cloned receptor showed high affinity binding of [ 3H ] -5-HT . Competition binding experiments with a variety of serotonin receptor ligands displayed a rank order of affinities corresponding to a P28221 subtype : 5-CT > 5-HT = metergoline > CGS 12066 > methysergide > sumatriptan > mianserin = (-)alpha-Me-5-HT = yohimbine > 8-OH-DPAT > or = rauwolscine > spiperone > DOI > propranolol > or = 2-Me-5-HT > or = ICS 205930 . Ketanserin and ritanserin displaced [ 3H ] -5-HT-binding in a biphasic manner . In situ hybridization revealed highest expression of the corresponding mRNA in the pyramidal layer of the olfactory tubercle and the nucleus caudatus and accumbens .
