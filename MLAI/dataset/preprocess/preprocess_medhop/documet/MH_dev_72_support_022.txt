[ Drugs stimulating insulin release. Importance of their use for improving glycemia , safety and quality of life in diabetes mellitus type 2 ] . Etiopathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is bipolar . On one hand there occurs impairment in beta-cell function caused by genetic factors or abnormal development during fetal period . On the other hand defects of peripheral insulin action are also of significant importance . The bipolarity is also expressed by changing relationship between genetic and environmental factors . P01308 release is connected with closing DB00171 -dependent kalium channel , a structure closely connected with sulfonylurea receptors . Several receptors may be distinguished : Q09428 in Langerhans isles and SUR2 in heart ( SUR2A ) and vessel smoot muscles ( SUR2B ) . In the treatment of insulin release disorders sulfonylureas are still of significant importance though repaglinid and phenyloalanine derivates also have some clinical importance . Within sulfonylurea derivates there have been developed some preparations of slow drug release ( DB01067 GITS , Diaprel MR ) . One daily dose of DB01067 GITS and lower tendency to hypoglycaemia favour acceptation of the therapy by the patients what is also important for their quality of life . Quality of life is now regarded as important as obtaining good indices of diabetes control .
