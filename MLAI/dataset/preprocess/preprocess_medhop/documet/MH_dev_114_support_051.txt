5- DB00233 Inhibits Acute Clostridium difficile Toxin A-Induced Colitis in Rats . We tested the hypothesis that DB00244 ( DB00244 ) inhibits toxin A-induced generation of colonic leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) and toxin A colitis in rats . Isolated colonic segments in anesthetized rats were treated intraluminally with toxin A for 3 hours with or without 30 minutes of pretreatment with either DB00244 or sulfapyridine and then colonic tissue levels of LTB4 were measured and inflammation was assessed . Separately , sulfasalazine was administered to rats in their drinking water for 5 days , isolated colonic segments were then prepared , toxin A was administered , and inflammation was assessed as before . Pretreatment with DB00244 inhibited toxin A-induced increased tissue LTB4 concentration in the colon . Sulfasalazine and DB00244 but not sulfapyridine significantly inhibited toxin A colitis . However , pretreatment with DB00244 did not protect against direct Q8NER1 -mediated colitis caused by capsaicin . Toxin A stimulated the release of DB05875 ( SP ) , and this effect was also inhibited by sulfasalazine and DB00244 but not by sulfapyridine . Thus , toxin A stimulates colonic LTB4 resulting in activation of Q8NER1 , release of SP , and colitis . Inhibition of P09917 by DB00244 disrupts this pathway and supports the concept that LTB4 activation of Q8NER1 plays a role in toxin A colitis .
