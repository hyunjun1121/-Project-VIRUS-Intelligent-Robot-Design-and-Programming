Novel use of endogenous GH-measurement directly after transsphenoidal microsurgery in acromegaly treated with pegvisomant . OBJECTIVE : The P10912 antagonist pegvisomant is increasingly used as therapy in acromegaly . Pituitary surgery might be indicated on pegvisomant treatment , due to side effects , adenoma growth or intention to cure after primary treatment . This study was initiated to clarify if , and when , GH measurement could be useful postoperatively with an assay specific for endogenous GH that does not cross-react with pegvisomant . METHODS : This study was designed as a prospective study in 2006 with the German Pituitary Working Group . Only 2 cases with potentially resectable adenomas from the German DB00082 Observational Study ( GPOS ) had been operated . Now with a post-operative follow-up of more than 5 years in these 2 cases , the usefulness of immediate pre-operative GH measurement shortly after pegvisomant treatment was evaluated . RESULTS : In both patients a steep decline of endogenous GH after transnasal microsurgery could be proven by using the special GH assay after near radical or radical removal , of the GH secreting adenomas respectively . Conventional GH assays showed no effect . GH half-life was more than 20 min in the patient with a small invasive residual adenoma and less than 20 min in the cured patient . Endogenous GH-levels declined to less than 1 ng/ml in the days after surgery in the patient with long-term cure . CONCLUSION : Measurement of endogenous GH in this special subgroup of patients under pegvisomant therapy can be used to decide upon early reoperation . Thus the beneficial effect of pegvisomant on acromegalic symptoms can be kept without interfering with post-operative monitoring of GH levels .
