[ P08473 activity in the guinea pig model of asthma ] . P08473 exists in airway epithelial cells , smooth muscle , and submucosa near glands , and cleaves tachykinins to inactive metabolites , thereby reducing there effects . To study the role of enkephalinase in asthmatic response , we measured its activity in guinea pig model of asthma . When compared with the control values , the enkephalinase activity was reduced during in immediate asthmatic response ( Q92932 ) and late asthmatic response ( P10586 ) . Compared with the control values ( 100 % ) , each value was 79.7 % , 73.4 % in the trachea and 74.3 % , 55.7 % in the lung respectively . Tracheal muscle preparation taken from the control , Q92932 , and P10586 groups were made and mounted in oxygenated modified Krebs-Ringer solution . The response was monitored by isometric transducer . Concentration response curves to P20366 with or without phosphoramidon were obtained . The contractile responses of the P10586 groups were enhanced in potency and efficiency . DB02557 potentiated the P20366 induced contraction of control and the Q92932 groups but was less potent in enhancing the contractile response in the P10586 group , showing less enkephalinase activity in the P10586 . These results suggest that the enkephalinase plays an important role in P10586 . In P10586 , the enkephalinase activity may be inhibited and the responsiveness of the smooth muscle to some bronchoconstrictor , such as tachykinins , may be increased .
