[ Leukemia- and lymphoma-associated flow cytometric , cytogenetic , and molecular genetic aberrations in healthy individuals ] . Most leukemia and lymphoma cases are characterized by specific flow cytometric , cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations , which can also be detected in healthy individuals in some cases . The authors review the literature concerning monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis , and the occurrence of chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(11;14) , P06748 - Q9UM73 fusion gene , O60674 V617F mutation , P11274 - P00519 fusion gene , P41212 - Q01196 ( P41212 - Q01196 ) , Q03164 - P51825 and P29590 - P10276 fusion gene in healthy individuals . At present , we do not know the importance of these aberrations . From the authors review it is evident that this phenomenon has both theoretical and practical ( diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic ) significance .
