[ Toxicogenetics of antiretroviral treatment ( II ) : neurotoxicity , hepatotoxicity , lactic acidosis , kidney damage , and other adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs ] . Several pharmacogenetics studies have analyzed the influence of specific genetic polymorphisms on the toxicity of antiretroviral treatment . The present review describes some of the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs in which a genetic predisposition may be involved : efavirenz-induced neurological toxicity , generally associated with the 516G > T polymorphism of liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2B6 ( P20813 ) ; hypersensitivity reactions to nevirapine , associated with specific alleles of major histocompatibility complex , mainly the HLA- Q8IUH3 *0101 allele , which , in combination with a high P01730 lymphocyte count , has been associated with systemic reactions and hepatitis in Caucasians , and the HLA-Cw8 allele , which is associated with hypersensitivity reactions in persons from the Italian island of Sardinia and from Japan ; nevirapine-induced hepatotoxicity associated with the C > T polymorphism in position 3435T of the P08183 ( MDR-1 ) gene codifying for glycoprotein P ( lower risk ) ; hyperbilirubinemia in patients exposed to atazanavir or indinavir carrying the P22309 *28 polymorphism ; peripheral neuropathy with nucleoside analogues associated with haplogroup T of the mitochondrial genome ( higher risk ) and with the Q30201 C282Y genotype of the hemochromatosis gene ( lower risk ) ; the mutation in codon 964 ( R964C ) of the P54098 gene that codifies the mitochondrial polymerase DNA gamma described in a Thai patient with lactic acidosis ; the Q92887 gene haplotypes associated with tenofovir-induced proximal tubulopathy , and the risk of pancreatitis in persons with mutations in the P13569 and SPINK-1 genes .
