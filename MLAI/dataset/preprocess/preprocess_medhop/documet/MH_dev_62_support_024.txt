Anti- P01375 therapy in Crohn 's disease . Anti-tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) strategies , the most studied of biological therapies , include chimeric monoclonal ( infliximab ) , humanized monoclonal ( CDP571 and the PEGylated DB08904 ) and fully human monoclonal ( adalimumab ) antibodies , p75 fusion protein ( etanercept ) , p55 soluble receptor ( onercept ) and small molecules such as MAPkinase inhibitors . The principal use of infliximab is in treating active Crohn 's disease patients not responding to or intolerant of conventional therapies . DB00065 is steroid sparing . The development of antibodies against infliximab is associated with an increased risk of infusion reactions , and a reduced duration of response to treatment , and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy reduces the immunogenic response . The demonstration of the efficacy of maintenance therapy every 8 weeks with infliximab in the randomised , controlled , ACCENT I trial opened up the strategy for regular maintenance . In patients who have failed therapy with cortocosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy and are poor surgical candidates , and patients with fistulizing disease , where infliximab therapy is chosen , regular maintenance therapy with infliximab is likely to be required . On the other hand , patients with severely active , steroid-refractory disease in whom immunosuppressive therapy and infliximab are initiated together , may respond adequately and be continued on long-term immunosuppressive therapy alone . In ulcerative colitis the role of infliximab remains uncertain .
