Structure of the human Q9H244 receptor in complex with an antithrombotic drug . P2Y receptors ( P2YRs ) , a family of purinergic G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , are activated by extracellular nucleotides . There are a total of eight distinct functional P2YRs expressed in human , which are subdivided into P47900 -like receptors and Q9H244 -like receptors . Their ligands are generally charged molecules with relatively low bioavailability and stability in vivo , which limits our understanding of this receptor family . P2Y12R regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation , and several antithrombotic drugs targeting P2Y12R -- including the prodrugs clopidogrel ( Plavix ) and prasugrel ( DB06209 ) that are metabolized and bind covalently , and the nucleoside analogue ticagrelor ( DB08816 ) that acts directly on the receptor -- have been approved for the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction . However , limitations of these drugs ( for example , a very long half-life of clopidogrel action and a characteristic adverse effect profile of ticagrelor ) suggest that there is an unfulfilled medical need for developing a new generation of P2Y12R inhibitors . Here we report the 2.6 Ã… resolution crystal structure of human P2Y12R in complex with a non-nucleotide reversible antagonist , AZD1283 . The structure reveals a distinct straight conformation of helix V , which sets P2Y12R apart from all other known class A GPCR structures . With AZD1283 bound , the highly conserved disulphide bridge in GPCRs between helix III and extracellular loop 2 is not observed and appears to be dynamic . Along with the details of the AZD1283-binding site , analysis of the extracellular interface reveals an adjacent ligand-binding region and suggests that both pockets could be required for dinucleotide binding . The structure provides essential insights for the development of improved P2Y12R ligands and allosteric modulators as drug candidates .
