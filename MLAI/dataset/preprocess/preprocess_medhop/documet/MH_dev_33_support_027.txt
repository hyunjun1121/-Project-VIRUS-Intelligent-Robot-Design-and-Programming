Results of a pivotal phase II study of brentuximab vedotin for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : DB08870 is an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) that selectively delivers monomethyl auristatin E , an antimicrotubule agent , into P28908 -expressing cells . In phase I studies , brentuximab vedotin demonstrated significant activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory P28908 -positive lymphomas . PATIENTS AND METHODS : In this multinational , open-label , phase II study , the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) after autologous stem-cell transplantation ( auto- P09683 ) . Patients had histologically documented P28908 -positive HL by central pathology review . A total of 102 patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks . In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity , patients received a maximum of 16 cycles . The primary end point was the overall objective response rate ( ORR ) determined by an independent radiology review facility . RESULTS : The ORR was 75 % with complete remission ( CR ) in 34 % of patients . The median progression-free survival time for all patients was 5.6 months , and the median duration of response for those in CR was 20.5 months . After a median observation time of more than 1.5 years , 31 patients were alive and free of documented progressive disease . The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral sensory neuropathy , nausea , fatigue , neutropenia , and diarrhea . CONCLUSION : The ADC brentuximab vedotin was associated with manageable toxicity and induced objective responses in 75 % of patients with relapsed or refractory HL after auto- P09683 . Durable CRs approaching 2 years were observed , supporting study in earlier lines of therapy .
