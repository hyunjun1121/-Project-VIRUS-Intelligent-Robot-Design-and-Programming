Monitoring afatinib treatment in P04626 -positive gastric cancer with DB09150 and 89Zr-trastuzumab PET . We evaluated the ability of the PET imaging agent (89)Zr-trastuzumab to delineate P04626 -positive gastric cancer and to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib . METHODS : Using (89)Zr-trastuzumab , (18)F- DB09150 , or 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ( (18)F- P17948 PET ) , we imaged P04626 -positive NCI-N87 and P04626 -negative MKN74 gastric cancer xenografts in mice . Next , we examined the pharmacodynamic effects of afatinib in NCI-N87 xenografts using (89)Zr-trastuzumab and (18)F- DB09150 PET and comparing imaging results to changes in tumor size and in protein expression as monitored by Western blot and histologic studies . RESULTS : Although (18)F- DB09150 uptake in NCI-N87 tumors did not change , a decrease in (89)Zr-trastuzumab uptake was observed in the afatinib-treated versus control groups ( 3.0 ± 0.0 percentage injected dose per gram ( % ID/g ) vs. 21.0 ± 3.4 % ID/g , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) . (89)Zr-trastuzumab PET results corresponded with tumor reduction , apoptosis , and downregulation of P04626 observed on treatment with afatinib . Downregulation of total P04626 , phosphorylated (p)- P04626 , and p- P00533 occurred within 24 h of the first dose of afatinib , with a sustained effect over 21 d of treatment . CONCLUSION : DB08916 demonstrated antitumor activity in P04626 -positive gastric cancer in vivo . (89)Zr-trastuzumab PET specifically delineated P04626 -positive gastric cancer and can be used to measure the pharmacodynamic effects of afatinib .
