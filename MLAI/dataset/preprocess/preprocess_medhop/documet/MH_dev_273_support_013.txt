Targeting P04275 as a novel anti-platelet therapy ; application of DB05202 , an Anti- P04275 aptamer , against thrombotic risk . Excessive activation of platelets is a causative factor for thrombotic diseases such as acute coronary syndrome or stroke , and various anti-platelet drugs were developed . DB00945 and clopidogrel have been used as gold standards for anti-platelet therapies , however , their clinical limitations including bleeding problem have increased the demand driving development of novel anti-platelet drugs with new targets . Among several activating pathways leading to platelet aggregation , the interaction between P04275 ( P04275 ) and glycoprotein Ib , which mainly occurs under high shear stress in arterioles , is recently suggested to be a new promising target . The anti-thrombotic efficacy of anti- P04275 agents , such as DB05202 , has been proved in several preclinical and clinical studies . Here , we will discuss the potential benefits of targeting P04275 as a novel antiplatelet therapy , providing an insight into the role of P04275 in increased thrombotic risk .
