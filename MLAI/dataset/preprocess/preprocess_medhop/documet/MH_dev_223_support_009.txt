Epigenetic variation during the adult lifespan : cross-sectional and longitudinal data on monozygotic twin pairs . The accumulation of epigenetic changes was proposed to contribute to the age-related increase in the risk of most common diseases . In this study on 230 monozygotic twin pairs ( MZ pairs ) , aged 18-89 years , we investigated the occurrence of epigenetic changes over the adult lifespan . Using mass spectrometry , we investigated variation in global ( LINE1 ) DNA methylation and in DNA methylation at P01308 , KCNQ1OT1 , P01344 , GNASAS , O95477 , P41159 , and P06850 , candidate loci for common diseases . Except for KCNQ1OT1 , interindividual variation in locus-specific DNA methylation was larger in old individuals than in young individuals , ranging from 1.2-fold larger at O95477 ( P = 0.010 ) to 1.6-fold larger at P01308 ( P = 3.7 × 10(-07) ) . Similarly , there was more within-MZ-pair discordance in old as compared with young MZ pairs , except for GNASAS , ranging from an 8 % increase in discordance each decade at P06850 ( P = 8.9 × 10(-06) ) to a 16 % increase each decade at P41159 ( P = 2.0 × 10(-08) ) . Still , old MZ pairs with strikingly similar DNA methylation were also observed at these loci . After 10-year follow-up in elderly twins , the variation in DNA methylation showed a similar pattern of change as observed cross-sectionally . The age-related increase in methylation variation was generally attributable to unique environmental factors , except for P06850 , for which familial factors may play a more important role . In conclusion , sustained epigenetic differences arise from early adulthood to old age and contribute to an increasing discordance of MZ twins during aging .
