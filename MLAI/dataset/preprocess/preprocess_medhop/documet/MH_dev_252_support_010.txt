Recombinational and physical mapping of the locus for primary open-angle glaucoma ( Q99972 ) on chromosome 1q23-q25 . Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized countries . A locus for juvenile-onset POAG , Q99972 , has been mapped to 1q21-q31 in a 9-cM interval . With recombinant haplotypes , we have now reduced the Q99972 interval to a maximum of 3 cM , between the D1S452/NGA1/D1S210 and NGA5 loci . These loci are 2.8 Mb apart on a 4.7-Mb contig that we have completed between the D1S2851 and D1S218 loci and that includes 96 YAC clones and 48 STSs . The new Q99972 interval itself is now covered by 25 YACs , 30 STSs , and 16 restriction enzyme site landmarks . The lack of a NotI site suggests that the region has few CpG islands and a low gene content . This is compatible with its predominant cytogenetic location on the 1q24 G-band . Finally , we have excluded important candidate genes , including genes coding for three ATPases ( P05026 , P23634 , P50993 ) , an ion channel ( VDAC4 ) , antithrombine III ( P01008 ) , and prostaglandin synthase ( P35354 ) . Our results provide a basis to identify the Q99972 gene .
