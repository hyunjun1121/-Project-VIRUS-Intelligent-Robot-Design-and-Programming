Genetic polymorphisms of P03372 , Q92731 , P05093 , and P11511 and the risk of breast cancer : a case control study from North India . Estrogen is a key driver of breast cancer and genes involved in its signaling and biosynthesis are crucial in breast cancer progression . In this study , we investigated the role of estrogen signaling and synthesis related genes polymorphism in susceptibility to breast cancer risk in North India population in a case-control approach . We examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in estrogen receptors , P03372 ( rs2234693 ) and Q92731 ( rs2987983 ) ; estrogen biosynthesis enzymes , P05093 ( rs743572 ) ; and aromatase , P11511 ( rs700519 ) with breast cancer risk . Cases ( n = 360 ) were matched to controls ( n = 360 ) by age , sex , ethnicity , and geographical location . Results provided evidence that all the genetic variants were significantly associated with breast cancer risk among North Indian women . Furthermore , on performing stratified analysis between breast cancer risk and different clinicopathological characteristics , we observed strong associations for menopausal status , estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) status , clinical stage , and histological grade . Our results suggest that these genes could be used as molecular markers to assess breast cancer susceptibility and predicting prognosis in North India population .
