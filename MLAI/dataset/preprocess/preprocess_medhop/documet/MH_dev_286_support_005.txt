[ Protective effects of penehyclidine hydrochloride against acute renal injury induced by hemorrhagic shock and lipopolysaccharides in rats ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride ( Q00325 ) in a rat model of renal injury induced by hemorrhagic shock and lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) . METHODS : Forty-five healthy Wistar rats were randomized into sham operated group , model group , and 3 penehyclidine hydrochloride ( Q00325 ) dose ( 1 , 2 and 3 mg/kg ) groups ( P78364 , Q8IXK0 , and Q8NDX5 groups , respectively ) . The arterial blood samples were collected to determine the concentrations of serum tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) , interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , urine creatinine ( Cr ) and blood urine nitrogen ( BUN ) , and the renal tissues were collected to measure the expressions of P05362 and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) and observe the pathological changes . RESULTS : P01375 -α , P10145 , IL-1 , Cr , BUN , P05362 and NF-κB in the 3 Q00325 groups were significantly lower than those in the model group ( P < 0.05 ) . P01375 -α , P10145 , IL-1 , Cr and BUN were significantly lower in P78364 ( P < 0.05 ) than in the Q8IXK0 and Q8NDX5 groups , and P05362 and NF-κB were similar between 3 Q00325 groups ( P > 0.05 ) . Compared with the model group , the 3 Q00325 groups showed lessened pathological changes in the renal tubules . CONCLUSION : Q00325 has protective effects against renal injury induced by hemorrhagic-endotoxin shock in rats , and treatment with 1 mg/kg Q00325 produces the most significant protective effect .
