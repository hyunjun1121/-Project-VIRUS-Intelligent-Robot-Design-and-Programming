Synchronous mucinous tumors of the appendix and the ovary associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei . A clinicopathologic study of six cases with comparative analysis of P01116 mutations . Mucinous tumors of the ovary are often associated with mucinous tumors of the appendix . It has not been clearly determined whether they are independent or metastatic neoplasms . A clinicopathologic study and a comparative analysis of P01116 mutations were done in six cases of synchronous ovarian and appendiceal tumors . The clinicopathologic features ( simultaneous presentation , bilaterality or right-sided predominance , similar histopathologic findings , presence of pseudomyxoma peritonei ) suggested that they were primary appendiceal tumors metastatic to the ovaries . DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue , and target sequences were amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction . Mutations were detected by the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphism , artificially introduced by the use of mutant amplimers . The pattern of P01116 mutations was identical in the ovarian and appendiceal tumors of all patients . Four patients had a P19440 --> Q6IB77 ( DB00145 --> DB00128 ) transition and one a P19440 --> GTT ( DB00145 --> DB00161 ) transversion , all detected in codon 12 . No mutation was found in the sixth patient in either the ovarian or the appendiceal tumor . Because P01116 mutations are considered to represent an early event in tumorigenesis , our results support a clonal nature for both tumors and suggest that they are not independent tumors but rather originate one from another .
