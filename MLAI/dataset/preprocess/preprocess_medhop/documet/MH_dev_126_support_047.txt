Mutant epidermal growth factor receptor up-regulates molecular effectors of tumor invasion . The gene most commonly altered in human glioblastomas is the epidermalgrowth factor receptor ( P00533 ) . We profiled transcripts induced by mutantEGFR to better understand its role in tumor progression . The pattern found suggested enhanced tumor invasion . The highly induced genes included extracellular matrix components , metalloproteases , and a serine protease . We confirmed that mutant P00533 did make glioblastoma cells both more motile and invasive using in vitro assays . Furthermore , inhibitors of P00533 ( DB00530 and Tyrphostin AG1478 ) selectively down-regulated these molecular effectors in glioblastoma cells , eliminating enhanced invasion .
