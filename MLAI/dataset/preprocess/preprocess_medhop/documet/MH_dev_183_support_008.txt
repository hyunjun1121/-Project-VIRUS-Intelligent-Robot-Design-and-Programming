[ Additive antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis ] . P30556 blocker ( ARB ) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) have been thought to be effective for reducing proteinuria in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis . Recently , an additive effect of these two types of angiotensin blockers has been reported in patients with IgA nephropathy , but the mechanism responsible for the effect has not yet been determined . In this study , we examined additive effect of these two drugs in chronic glomerulonephritis patients . Ten patients with biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis ( eight IgA nephropathy patients , two membranous nephropathy patients ) , non-nephrotic proteinuria ( protein , 0.5 to 3.5 g/day ) received candesartan cilexetil ( 2 or 4 mg ) for 8 weeks . After the 8 weeks , a combination of perindopril erbumine ( 1 or 2 mg ) and candesartan cilexetil was administered to the patients . DB00790 was stopped after the 8-week administration of the two drugs . DB00796 alone reduced proteinuria by 13 % . Combination of these two drugs induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria ( 48 % ; p < 0.05 vs other periods ) . The decrease in mean blood pressure by the combination therapy was significantly correlated with the decrease in proteinuria . The combination of drugs also reduced the amount of urinary type-IV collagen excretion . An additive effect of ACEI and ARB on proteinuria and urinary type-IV collagen excretion was recognized in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis .
