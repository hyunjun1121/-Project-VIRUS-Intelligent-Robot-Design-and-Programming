mu-Opioid receptor agonists differentially regulate the expression of miR-190 and Q13562 . The agonists of mu-opioid receptor ( P35372 ) induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) phosphorylation through different pathways : morphine uses the protein kinase C ( PKC ) -pathway , whereas fentanyl functions in a beta-arrestin2-dependent manner . In addition , the two pathways result in the different cellular location of phosphorylated P29323 and the activation of different sets of transcriptional factors . In the current study , the influence of the two pathways on the expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) was investigated . After treating the primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons and the mouse hippocampi with morphine or fentanyl for 3 days , seven miRNAs regulated by one or two of the agonists were identified . One of the identified miRNAs , miR-190 , was down-regulated by fentanyl but not by morphine . This down-regulation was attenuated by 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(methylthio)butadiene ( U0126 ) , which blocks the phosphorylation of P29323 . When fentanyl-induced but not morphine-induced P29323 phosphorylation was blocked in the primary cultures from beta-arrestin2(-/-) mouse , fentanyl did not decrease the expression of miR-190 . However , a PKC inhibitor that blocked morphine-induced P29323 phosphorylation specifically had no effect on the miR-190 down-regulation . Therefore the decrease in miR-190 expression resulted from the agonist-selective P29323 phosphorylation . In addition , the expressional changes in one of the miR-190 targets , neurogenic differentiation 1 ( Q13562 ) , correlated with those in miR-190 expression , suggesting the P35372 could regulate the Q13562 pathways via the control of miR-190 expression .
