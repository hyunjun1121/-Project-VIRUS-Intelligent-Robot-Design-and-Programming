DB00594 derivatives induce apoptosis by depleting ER Ca(2+) stores in vascular endothelial cells . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : DB00594 derivatives are blockers of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger ( NHE ) and at micromolar concentrations have protective effects on cardiac and brain ischaemia/reperfusion injury but at higher concentrations also induce apoptosis . Here , we aimed to elucidate the mechanism related to this cytotoxic action . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : We quantified the expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and measured changes in luminal ER Ca(2+) concentration ( [Ca(2+)](ER) ) with a ' cameleon ' indicator , D1ER . KEY RESULTS : DB00594 derivatives induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells , an effect that increased at alkaline extracellular pH . The potency order for cytotoxicity was 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride ( HMA ) > 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl) amiloride > 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride ( EIPA ) >> amiloride . HMA dose-dependently increased the transcription of the ER stress genes P35638 and O75807 and rapidly depleted [Ca(2+)](ER) , mimicking the effects of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase ( SERCA ) inhibitor thapsigargin . The P19634 -specific inhibitor HOE 694 inhibited NHE activity by 87 % but did not alter [Ca(2+)](ER) . The decrease in [Ca(2+)](ER) evoked by amiloride derivatives was also observed in HeLa cells and was mirrored by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : DB00594 derivatives disrupt ER and cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis by a mechanism unrelated to NHE inhibition , most likely by interfering with the activity of SERCA . We propose that ER Ca(2+) depletion and subsequent ER stress provide a rationale framework for the apoptotic effects of amiloride derivatives .
