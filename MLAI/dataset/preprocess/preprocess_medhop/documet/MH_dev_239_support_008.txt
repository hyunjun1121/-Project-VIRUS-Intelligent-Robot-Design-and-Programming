Enhancement of retroviral infection in vitro by anti-Le(y) IgG : reversal by humanization of monoclonal mouse antibody . Monoclonal mouse IgG3 antibody ( P00519 364 ) against the carbohydrate Le(y) antigen enhanced infection in vitro with HTLV-1 and with HIV-1 when propagated in both transformed and normal lymphocytes . Enhancement was independent of complement , occurred with both lymphocytes and monocytes as target cells , and did not use either L(ey) epitopes on target cells for cross-linkage of virus to the cell or the Fc part of the antibody as a ligand for any cellular receptor . For enhancement to occur , binding of anti-Le(y) antibody to virus was required to take place before virus binding to its specific receptor with no indication of any alternative pathway of infection , as evidenced by abrogation of enhancement by anti- P01730 MAb or soluble recombinant P01730 , and also the inability of anti-Le(y) MAb to mediate HIV infection of DB01040 -2 cells in which HTLV-1/HIV pseudovirus infection was enhanced . While F(ab)2 fragments of P00519 364 also enhanced infection , a human/mouse chimeric antibody and a fully humanized antibody had no enhancing effect on free virus infection . We suggest that binding of anti-Le(y) P00519 364 or its F(ab)2 fragment induced a conformational change in the gp120 oligomers facilitating the process of infection , and that this function was abrogated by the IgG1 Fc of the chimeric and the humanized antibodies . The observations indicate that the non-paratope domains of antiviral antibodies can influence their function as neutralizing or enhancing for infection .
