Dynamic and ligand-selective interactions of vitamin D receptor with retinoid X receptor and cofactors in living cells . The vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) mediates vitamin D signaling in numerous physiological and pharmacological processes , including bone and calcium metabolism , cellular growth and differentiation , immunity , and cardiovascular function . Although transcriptional regulation by P11473 has been investigated intensively , an understanding of ligand-selective dynamic P11473 conformations remains elusive . Here , we examined ligand-dependent dynamic interactions of P11473 with retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) , steroid receptor coactivator 1 ( Q15788 ) , and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor ( Q9Y618 ) in cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays . We compared the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] , lithocholic acid ( LCA ) , and ( 25R ) -25-adamantyl-1α,25-dihydroxy-2-methylene-22,23-didehydro-19,26,27-trinor-20-epivitamin D(3) ( ADTT ) , a partial agonist/antagonist vitamin D derivative . In the absence of ligand , P11473 homodimers were preferred to RXR heterodimers and were associated with Q9Y618 . 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced heterodimerization with RXR , dissociation of Q9Y618 , and association of Q15788 . LCA and ADTT induced those effects to a lesser extent at concentrations that did not induce expression of the P11473 target gene Q07973 in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells . Unlike in HEK293 cells , ADTT increased Q07973 expression in HCT116 cells and increased the association of P11473 and Q9Y618 on the Q07973 promoter . The results indicate that ligand-selective conformation may lead to unique cofactor complex formation in a cell context-dependent manner . The combination of FRET and ChIP assays is a powerful tool useful in understanding ligand-selective dynamic P11473 conformations and the development of selective P11473 modulators .
