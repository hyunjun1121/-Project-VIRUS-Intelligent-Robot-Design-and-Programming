DB06186 : unleashing the power of the immune system through P16410 blockade . Malignant melanoma is rising faster in incidence than any other malignancy . Long-term remission or " cure " is rare and is almost exclusively limited to therapies that stimulate an immune antitumor response . DB06186 is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 ( P16410 ) , an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells . DB06186 is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy . Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity . A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm . The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult . Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization ( WHO ) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria . New immune response criteria have been proposed . Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks , with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months . The major drug- related adverse side effects ( 10 % -15 % grade 3 or above ) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash , colitis , hypophysitis , thyroiditis , and hepatitis . Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms . Algorithms for the treatment of other adverse side effects have been developed . The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents , such as corticosteroids , does not appear to impair antitumor response . With proper monitoring and management of side effects , ipilimumab is an extremely safe drug to administer . The benefits of ipilimumab will most certainly extend to other malignancies in the near future .
