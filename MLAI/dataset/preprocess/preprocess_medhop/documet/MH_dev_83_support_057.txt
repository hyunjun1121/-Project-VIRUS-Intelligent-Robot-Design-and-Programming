Celecoxib and melatonin in prevention of female rat mammary carcinogenesis . The present experiment aims to evaluate tumor suppressive effects of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) celecoxib ( DB00482 , Pfizer ) administered alone and in combination with melatonin in the prevention of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea ( P48645 ) -induced mammary carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley female rats . Celecoxib was administered daily at a concentration of 1.666 g/kg diet to two groups during 20 weeks ( starting a week before first P48645 application ) . A combination of celecoxib and melatonin applied in drinking water ( 20 microg/ml drinking water ) , daily from 15:00 to 08:00 hours was administered to the second group . The anticarcinogenic effects of chemopreventive drugs were compared with control ( P48645 ) animals . Celecoxib administration decreased mammary tumor incidence ( by 24 % ) , while combination of celecoxib and melatonin decreased tumor incidence even more significantly ( -30 % ) . Significant decrease in tumor frequency per group was recorded in both groups with chemoprevention : celecoxib alone ( -54 % ) and combination of celecoxib and melatonin ( -64 % ) . Celecoxib significantly influenced tumor frequency per animal in the group with combination of both protective substances ( -52 % ) . Celecoxib administration resulted in prolonged latency by 3 % , and by 13 % in the group with combination of both protective substances . These results confirm preventive effects of celecoxib in induced rat mammary carcinogenesis . The administration of isolated P61006 had only lesser effect , but in the combination with CELE revealed some potentiating influence in mammary carcinogenesis inhibition . The present study is the first to prove efficacy of the above-mentioned celecoxib and melatonin intake . Our results point to the need for a deeper analysis of coxib efficacy in human carcinogenesis .
