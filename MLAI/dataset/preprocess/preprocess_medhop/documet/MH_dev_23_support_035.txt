Importance of MEK in neutrophil microbicidal responsiveness . Exposure of neutrophils to inflammatory stimuli such as the chemoattractant FMLP leads to activation of responses including cell motility , the oxidative burst , and secretion of proteolytic enzymes . A signaling cascade involving sequential activation of P04049 , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) , and extracellular signal regulated kinase ( P29323 ) is also rapidly activated after agonist exposure . The temporal relationship between these events suggests that the kinases may be involved in triggering the effector functions , but direct evidence of a causal relationship is lacking . To assess the role of the MEK/ P29323 pathway in the activation of neutrophil responses , we studied the effects of PD098059 , a potent and selective inhibitor of MEK . Preincubation of human neutrophils with 50 microM PD098059 almost completely ( > 90 % ) inhibited the FMLP-induced activation of MEK-1 and MEK-2 , the isoforms expressed by neutrophils . This dose of PD098059 virtually abrogated chemoattractant-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of P27361 and P28482 , implying that MEKs are the predominant upstream activators of these mitogen-activated protein kinases . Pretreatment of neutrophils with the MEK antagonist inhibited the oxidative burst substantially and phagocytosis only moderately . In addition , PD098059 antagonized the delay of apoptosis induced by exposure to granulocyte-macrophage P04141 . However , the effects of PD098059 were selective , as it failed to inhibit other responses , including chemoattractant-induced exocytosis of primary and secondary granules , polymerization of F-actin , chemotaxis , or activation of phospholipase A2 . We conclude that MEK and P29323 contribute to the activation of the oxidative burst and phagocytosis , and participate in cytokine regulation of apoptosis .
