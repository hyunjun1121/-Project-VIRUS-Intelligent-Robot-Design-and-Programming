Q9Y4H2 Deficiency impairs DB01221 receptor-dependent long-term potentiation . The beneficial effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I on cognition have been documented in humans and animal models . Conversely , obesity , hyperinsulinemia , and diabetes increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . However , the mechanisms by which insulin regulates synaptic plasticity are not well understood . Here , we report that complete disruption of insulin receptor substrate 2 ( Irs2 ) in mice impairs long-term potentiation ( LTP ) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus . Basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation were similar between the 2 groups of mice . Induction of LTP by high-frequency conditioning tetanus did not activate postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptors in hippocampus slices from Irs2(-/-) mice , although the expression of Q12879 , Q13224 , and P78352 was equivalent to wild-type controls . Activation of Fyn , AKT , and MAPK in response to tetanus stimulation was defective in Irs2(-/-) mice . Interestingly , Q9Y4H2 was phosphorylated during induction of LTP in control mice , revealing a potential new component of the signaling machinery which modulates synaptic plasticity . Given that Q9Y4H2 expression is diminished in Type 2 diabetics as well as in AD patients , these data may reveal an explanation for the prevalence of cognitive decline in humans with metabolic disorders by providing a mechanistic link between insulin resistance and impaired synaptic transmission .
