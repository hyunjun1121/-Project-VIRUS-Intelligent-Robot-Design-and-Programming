The regulation of rotenone-induced inflammatory factor production by DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel expressed in BV-2 cells . Our previous studies have demonstrated that activating DB00171 -sensitive potassium channel ( K( DB00171 ) channel ) , not only improved Parkinsonian behavior and neurochemical symptoms , but also reduced P35228 activity and mRNA levels in striatum and nigra of rotenone rat model of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . In this study , it was first shown that the subunits of K( DB00171 ) channels are expressed in BV-2 cells , and then it was investigated whether K( DB00171 ) channel was involved in regulating inflammatory factor production from BV-2 cells activated by rotenone . It was found that K( DB00171 ) channel was expressed in BV-2 cell and formed by the combination of Kir 6.1 and Q09428 2A/2B . K( DB00171 ) channel openers ( KCOs ) including pinacidil , diazoxide and iptakalim ( Ipt ) exerted beneficial effects on rotenone-induced morphological alterations of BV-2 cells , decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) production and the expression and activity of inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) . Either glibenclamide or 5-hydroxydecanoate acid ( a selective mitochondrial K( DB00171 ) channel blocker ) could abolish the effects of KCOs , suggesting that K( DB00171 ) channels , especially mitochondrial DB00171 -sensitive potassium channels ( mitoK( DB00171 ) channels ) , played a crucial role in preventing the activation of BV-2 cells , and subsequently the production of a variety of proinflammatory factors . Therefore , activation of K( DB00171 ) channel might be a new therapeutic strategy for treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders .
