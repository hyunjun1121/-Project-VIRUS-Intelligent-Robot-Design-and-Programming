Particle size of latex beads dictates IL-1β production mechanism . Macrophages ( Mϕ ) are well documented to produce IL-1β through various signaling pathways in response to small particles such as silica , asbestos and urea crystals , in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . However , it has not been clear to what extent particle size affects the response . To investigate this point , we stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) with size-defined latex beads ( LxB ) . Although both nano-sized ( 20 nm ) and micro-sized ( 1,000 nm ) LxB induced IL-1β production , only the nano-sized particles formed large intracellular vacuoles . In contrast , 100 nm LxB did not induce either of the responses . The same cellular responses were also observed in primary microglia cells . Although K(+) efflux and Q96P20 activation in BMDM were crucial in response to both 20 and 1,000 nm LxB , only IL-1β production by 20 nm LxB was sensitive to cathepsin B and Q99572 , a receptor for DB00171 . The response by 1,000 nm LxB relied on a robust production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , since IL-1β production was remarkably reduced by ROS inhibitors such as diphenylene iodonium ( DPI ) and DB06151 ( Q9C000 ) . In contrast , IL-1β production by 20 nm LxB was augmented by Q9C000 and in BMDM deficient in thioredoxin-binding protein-2 ( P20226 -2 ) , a negative regulator of the ROS scavenger thioredoxin . These results suggest that the cells responded differently in their secretion of IL-1β depending on particle size , and that there is a range within which neither pathway works .
