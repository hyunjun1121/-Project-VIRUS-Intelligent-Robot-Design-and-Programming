Chronic inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase improves endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats . P14324 ( FPPS , EC 2.5.1.10 ) , an essential enzyme in the mevalonate pathway , catalyzes the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates . The isoprenoid intermediates are needed for protein isoprenylation of RhoA for its function on regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) . We previously reported that FPPS were upregulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) when compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats ( WKY ) , and this was accompanied by development of endothelial dysfunction . Five-week-old male rats were daily gavaged with vehicle or an FPPS inhibitor ( alendronate , 1 or 10mg/kg ) . After 12-week administration of alendronate , endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation were measured in isolated aortic rings . Twelve-week of alendronate ( 10mg/kg/day ) treatment restored the impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in SHR . Furthermore , long-term treatment with an FPPS inhibitor significantly suppressed RhoA activation and increased phospho- P29474 / P29474 ratio . In conclusion , chronic treatment with an FPPS inhibitor improves the endothelial function in SHR , and the upregulation of phospho- P29474 / P29474 ratio with inhibition of RhoA activation may be an important mechanism .
