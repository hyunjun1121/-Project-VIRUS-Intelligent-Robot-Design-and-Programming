Hypoxia-independent angiogenesis in adipose tissues during cold acclimation . The molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in relation to adipose tissue metabolism remain poorly understood . Here , we show that exposure of mice to cold led to activation of angiogenesis in both white and brown adipose tissues . In the inguinal depot , cold exposure resulted in elevated expression levels of brown-fat-associated proteins , including uncoupling protein-1 ( P25874 ) and P20142 -1alpha . Proangiogenic factors such as P15692 were upregulated , and endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors , including thrombospondin , were downregulated . In wild-type mice , the adipose tissues became hypoxic during cold exposure ; in P25874 (-/-) mice , hypoxia did not occur , but , remarkably , the augmented angiogenesis was unaltered and was thus hypoxia independent . Intriguingly , P35968 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis and significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity . Unexpectedly , P17948 blockage resulted in the opposite effects : increased adipose vascularity and nonshivering thermogenesis capacity . Our findings have conceptual implications concerning application of angiogenesis modulators for treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders .
