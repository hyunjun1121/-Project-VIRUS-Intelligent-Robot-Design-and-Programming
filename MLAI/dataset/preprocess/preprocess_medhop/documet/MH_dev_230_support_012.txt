Activity , pharmacological inhibition and biological regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in Trypanosoma brucei . Activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase , the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of steroids and polyisoprenoids in mammalian cells , has been detected in both the bloodstream form and the culture-adapted procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei ( 3.7 +/- 0.6 and 12.7 +/- 1.8 pmol mevalonate produced min-1 ( mg cell protein ) -1 , respectively ) . The enzyme activity is enriched 6-fold in microsomal fractions . Several competitive inhibitors of mammalian P04035 , including synvinolin ( simvastatin ) , inhibit the multiplication of both forms of trypanosome in vitro ( IC50 , approx. 25-50 microM after 2-3 days ) . This growth inhibition is potentiated by agents interfering with the exogenous supply of cholesterol , such as antibodies blocking the low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor , or 5 microM chloroquine . Conversely , growth inhibition by synvinolin can be largely reverted either by 300 nM LDL or by products of the mevalonate pathway , such as 20 mM mevalonate and in procyclics by 100 microM squalene or cholesterol . In procyclics , low concentrations of synvinolin selectively inhibit the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols , but not into fatty acids . These results argue for a critical role in trypanosomes of a mevalonate pathway , that is involved in the biosynthesis of sterol and probably of other metabolites . The P04035 activity is decreased 2-fold in procyclics incubated with 4 mM mevalonate and increased 2-fold in the presence of 2.5 microM synvinolin . DB00641 also upregulates LDL binding up to 4-fold . These data suggest that P04035 and P01130 expression are regulated in T. brucei as in mammalian cells , to ensure sterol homeostasis .
