The Mek1 phosphorylation cascade plays a role in meiotic recombination of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Mek1 is a Chk2/Rad53/Cds1-related protein kinase that is required for proper meiotic progression of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . However , the molecular mechanisms of Mek1 regulation and Mek1 phosphorylation targets are unclear . Here , we report that Mek1 is phosphorylated at serine-12 ( P28222 ) , Q92748 and threonine-15 ( T15 ) by Rad3 ( ATR ) and/or Tel1 ( Q13315 ) kinases that are activated by meiotic programmed double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Mutations of these sites by alanine replacement caused abnormal meiotic progression and recombination rates . Phosphorylation of these sites triggers autophosphorylation of Mek1 ; indeed , alanine replacement mutations of Mek1-T318 and -T322 residues in the activation loop of Mek1 reduced Mek1 kinase activity and meiotic recombination rates . Substrates of Mek1 include Mus81-T275 , Rdh54- Q8NHM4 and Rdh54-T673 . Mus81-T275 is known to regulate the Mus81 function in DNA cleavage , whereas Rdh54-T6A/T673A mutant cells showed abnormal meiotic recombination . Taken together , we conclude that the phosphorylation of Mek1 by Rad3 or Tel1 , Mek1 autophosphorylation and Mus81 or Rdh54 phosphorylation by Mek1 regulate meiotic progression in S. pombe .
