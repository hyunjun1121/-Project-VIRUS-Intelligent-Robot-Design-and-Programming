Cholecystokinin mediates progression and metastasis of pancreatic cancer associated with dietary fat . BACKGROUND : Obesity and dietary fat are associated with increased risk of several malignancies including pancreatic cancer . The incidence of pancreatic cancer is increased in countries that consume diets high in fat . AIM : The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship and mechanism of action between dietary fat and endogenous cholecystokinin ( CCK ) on pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in an immunocompetent animal model . METHODS : C57BL/6 mice were placed on regular , low-fat , or high-fat diets for 8 weeks before establishment of Panc-02 orthotopic pancreatic tumors . Mice were then treated with a P32238 antagonist , devazepide , or vehicle for an additional 2.5 weeks . Pancreas tumors were weighed and metastases counted . Blood CCK levels were measured by radioimmunoassay ( RIA ) . Tissues were examined histologically and studied for genes associated with metastasis by RT-PCR array . Effects of the CCK antagonist on Panc-02 cells invasiveness was assessed in a Matrigel invasion assay . RESULTS : Mice that received the high-fat diet had larger tumors and tenfold higher serum CCK levels by RIA compared to normal diet controls ( p < 0.01 ) . Pancreatic tumors in high-fat diet mice treated with the antagonist had fewer intravascular tumor emboli and metastases compared to controls . The reduction in tumor emboli correlated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( P15692 ) expression in tumors ( p < 6 × 10(-9) ) . In vitro invasiveness of Panc-02 cells also was reduced by P32238 antagonist treatment ( p = 1.33 × 10(-6) ) . CONCLUSION : CCK is a mediator of dietary fat-associated pancreatic cancer . CCK is also involved in the invasiveness of pancreatic tumors through a mechanism involving P15692 .
