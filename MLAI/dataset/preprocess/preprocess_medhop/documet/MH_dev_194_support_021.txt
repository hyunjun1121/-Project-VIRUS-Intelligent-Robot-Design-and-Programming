Effect of the hemoregulatory peptide (pEEDCK)2 (pyroGlu- DB00142 - DB00128 - DB00151 -Lys)2 and MIP-1alpha is reduced in bone marrow cultures from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . The granulocyte-derived hemoregulatory peptide pyroGlu- DB00142 - DB00128 - DB00151 -Lys = pEEDCK is known to keep hematopoietic cells quiescent . When oxidized to its dimeric form (pEEDCK)2 , it activates growth of hematopoietic progenitors in association with stroma-derived cytokines . (pEEDCK)2 has a DB00151 - DB00151 motif which is also a typical feature of the macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP-1alpha ) . The present study was designed to analyze differences between the response of normal and leukemic progenitor cells to (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha . When long-term bone marrow cultures ( LTBMCs ) were incubated with (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha and/or cytokines , the stimulatory effect on colony-forming units-granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte of LTBMC from chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) patients was less than 50 % compared to LTBMC from healthy humans . No difference in oncogene expression could be observed in LTBMC from CML patients regarding reduction of Philadelphia chromosome-associated transcription of the P11274 - P00519 gene . With respect to the expression of growth and differentiation-associated genes ( Galpha16 , P09917 , phospholipaseA2 , c-kit , and P28906 ) , which were analyzed from LTBMC by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction , the same transcription rate was observed in CML patients and healthy donors . However , two isoforms of a key enzyme of oxidative metabolism , carnitine palmitoyltransferase ( P50416 and Q92523 ) , showed 50-fold higher expression rates in LTBMC cells of healthy donors compared to CML patients . It is known that a decrease in oxidative metabolism is associated with an increase in redox equivalents in malignancy . This might result in a reduction of disulphide bonds in (pEEDCK)2 or MIP-1alpha , thus inducing a downregulation of these factors in bone marrow from CML patients .
