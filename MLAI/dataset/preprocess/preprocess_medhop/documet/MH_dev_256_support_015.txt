DB06626 modulates hypoxia-induced blood-retina barrier permeability and expression of growth factors . This study investigates the effects of the multikinase inhibitor axitinib on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) receptors 1/2 ( P17948 /2 ) and platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor beta ( P09619 -β ) , hypoxia-induced increased tissue permeability , occludin , zonula occludens protein 1 ( ZO-1 ) , P15692 , and PDGF expression of human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Primary human Q96AT9 cells and HUVECs were exposed to hypoxia and axitinib . Viability of cells , tissue permeability , and expression of occludin , ZO-1 , P15692 , PDGF , P17948 /2 and P09619 -β , and their mRNAs , were investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , western blotting , and immunohistochemistry . Treatment with axitinib reduced expression of P17948 /2 and P09619 -β . Hypoxia decreased cell viability , occludin , and ZO-1 expression and increased tissue permeability , expression , and secretion of P15692 and PDGF . DB06626 significantly reduced hypoxia-induced effects on HUVEC and Q96AT9 cells . Our in vitro results suggest that axitinib may have promising properties as a potential treatment for diabetic macular edema .
