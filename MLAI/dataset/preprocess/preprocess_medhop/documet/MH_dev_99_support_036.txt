Genetic interaction between genes involved in NF-κB signaling pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus . Recently , multiple genetic associations have been found between genes involved in nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB ) signaling pathway and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) or other autoimmune diseases . This study was undertaken to replicate some of these associations and further test for genetic interactions among these genes in SLE in a Chinese population . Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in P19838 , Q04864 , inhibitor of κB-like ( IκBL ) , IκB kinase β ( O14920 ) , tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 ( Q9Y4K3 ) , tumor necrosis factor a-induced protein 3 ( P21580 ) , P21580 interacting protein 1 ( Q15025 ) were genotyped in 898 Chinese patients with SLE and 988 healthy controls by Sequenom MassArray technology . Single-marker genetic association analysis was performed , and additive and multiplicative interactions were analyzed . Associations of P21580 rs2230926 ( p=1.43 × 10(-3) ) and Q15025 rs10036748 ( p=4.33 × 10(-3) ) with SLE were replicated in our study . Two other SNPs , P19838 rs28362491 and IκBL rs2071592 , showed nominal evidence for association ( p=4.70 × 10(-2) and p=5.90 × 10(-3) , respectively ) but these were not significant after applying Bonferroni correction . Additive interaction analysis revealed significant interaction between P19838 rs28362491 and P21580 rs2230926 ( RERI=0.98 , 95 % CI=0.02-1.93 ; AP=43.2 % , 95 % CI=0.12-0.74 ) . Significant multiplicative interaction was observed between P19838 rs28362491 and Q15025 rs3792783 ( p=0.03 ) . Our results provide evidence for gene-gene interactions , which further support the important role of NF-κB signaling pathway in the genetic basis of SLE and the notion of genetic interactions accounting for missing heritability .
