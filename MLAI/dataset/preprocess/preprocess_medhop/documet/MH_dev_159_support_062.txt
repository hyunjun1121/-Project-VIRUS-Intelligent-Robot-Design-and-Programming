[ Induction of antitumor immune response by NK-cell-sensitive target cells transfected by P33681 -1 gene ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether the expression of P33681 -1 is involved in NK cell activation . METHODS : P33681 -1 gene was transfected into K562 cell line ( a sensitive target cell of NK cell , without MHC class I expression ) by electropolation . Specific cytotoxicity of NK cells to P33681 +K562 cell was assayed by 4-h Cr release assay . The proliferation of NK cells induced by P33681 +K562 cell was analysed by Flow Cytometry . Expansion of NK cells and cloning of NK cells were performed by mixed lymphocyte-tumor cultures and limiting dilution analysis . Production of P01375 -A , GM- P04141 and IFN-A was detected by ELISA tests . RESULTS : The cytotoxicity of NK cells to P33681 +K562 cell could be induced and that the number of NK cells could be increased by stimulation with P33681 +K562 cells , in particular , further enhanced with biotherapeutic agent such as OK432 and P60568 . Also , NK cell clones were established . Cytokines such as P01375 - A , P27352 - A and GM- P04141 were detected in the supernatant produced by NK cell clones . In addition , culture of lymphocytes in the presence of supernatant produced by NK cell clones and tumor antigens resulted in an increased autologous tumor killing( Q06187 ) . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that K562 cells transfected by P33681 -1 gene may elicit a series of antitumor immunity and these cells may be used for further development of therapeutic tumor vaccine .
