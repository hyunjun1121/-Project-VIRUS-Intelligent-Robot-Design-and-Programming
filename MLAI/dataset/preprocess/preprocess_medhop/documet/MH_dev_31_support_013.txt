DB06287 induces surfactant lipid accumulation and lung inflammation in mice . Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) is a well-known adverse effect of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) inhibitors . However , it remains unknown how lung toxicities are induced by P42345 inhibitors . Here , we constructed a mouse model of P42345 inhibitor-induced ILD using temsirolimus and examined the pathogenesis of the disease . Male ICR mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of different doses of temsirolimus ( 3 or 30 mg·kg(-1)·wk(-1) ) or vehicle . DB06287 treatment increased capillary-alveolar permeability and induced neutrophil infiltration and fibrinous exudate into the alveolar space , indicating alveolar epithelial and/or endothelial injury . It also induced macrophage depletion and the accumulation of excessive surfactant phospholipids and cholesterols . Alveolar macrophage depletion is thought to cause surfactant lipid accumulation . To further examine whether temsirolimus has cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects on alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells , we performed in vitro experiments . DB06287 inhibited cell proliferation and viability in both alveolar macrophage and alveolar epithelial cells . DB06287 treatment caused some signs of pulmonary inflammation , including upregulated expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in both bronchoalveolar lavage cells and lung homogenates , and an increase in lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . These findings indicate that temsirolimus has the potential to induce alveolar epithelial injury and to deplete alveolar macrophages followed by surfactant lipid accumulation , resulting in pulmonary inflammation . This is the first study to focus on the pathogenesis of P42345 inhibitor-induced ILD using an animal model .
