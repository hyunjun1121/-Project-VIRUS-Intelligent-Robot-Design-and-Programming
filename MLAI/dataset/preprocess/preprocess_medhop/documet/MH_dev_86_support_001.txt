DB00175 improves renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway . Statins are known to lessen the severity of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury . The present study was undertaken to define the mechanism of renoprotective actions of statins using a mouse kidney injury model . Treatment of mice with pravastatin , a widely used statin , improved renal function after renal ischemia-reperfusion without lowering the plasma cholesterol level . Administration of pravastatin with mevalonate , a product of P04035 , eliminated renal protection suggesting an effect of pravastatin on mevalonate or its metabolism . In hypercholestrolemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice with reduced P04035 activity ; the degree of injury was less severe than in control mice , however , there was no protective action of pravastatin on renal injury in the knockout mice . Treatment with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor ( L-744832 ) mimicked pravastatin 's protective effect but co-administration with the statin provided no additional protection . Both pravastatin and L-744832 inhibited the injury-induced increase in plasma P05231 concentration to a similar extent . Our results suggest the protective effect of pravastatin on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate-isoprenoid pathway independent of its lipid lowering action .
