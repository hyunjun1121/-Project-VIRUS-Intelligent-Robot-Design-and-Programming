Managing the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis : a future role for potentiators and correctors . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , a severe genetic disease , is caused by mutations that alter the structure and function of P13569 , a plasma membrane channel permeable to chloride and bicarbonate . Defective anion transport in CF irreversibly damages the lungs , pancreas , liver , and other organs . CF mutations cause loss of P13569 function in multiple ways . In particular , class 3 mutations such as p.Gly551Asp strongly decrease the time spent by P13569 in the open state ( gating defect ) . Instead , class 2 mutations impair the maturation of P13569 protein and its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane ( trafficking defect ) . The deletion of phenylalanine 508 ( p.Phe508del ) , the most frequent mutation among CF patients ( 70-90 % ) , destabilizes the P13569 protein , thus causing both a trafficking and a gating defect . These two defects can be overcome with drug-like molecules generically called correctors and potentiators , respectively . The potentiator Kalydecoâ„¢ ( also known as DB08820 or VX-770 ) , developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals , has been recently approved by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency ( P15941 ) for the treatment of CF patients carrying at least one P13569 allele with the p.Gly551Asp mutation ( 2-5 % of all patients ) . In contrast , the corrector VX-809 , which significantly improves p.Phe508del- P13569 trafficking in vitro , is still under study in clinical trials . Because of multiple defects caused by the p.Phe508del mutation , it is probable that rescue of the mutant protein will require combined treatment with correctors having different mechanisms of action . This review evaluates the status of experimental and clinical research in pharmacotherapy for the CF basic defect .
