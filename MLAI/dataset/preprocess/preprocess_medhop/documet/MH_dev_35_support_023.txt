DB04946 binding to human and rat dopamine and 5-HT receptors . DB04946 ( DB04946 ; 1- [ 4-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]propoxy] -3- methoxyphenyl ] ethanone ) is a compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia . DB04946 displays affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and for 5- Q13049 receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic . Here we present an examination of the affinity of iloperidone to a variety of human and rat homologs of dopamine and 5-HT receptor subtypes . We employed receptor binding assays using membranes from cells stably expressing human dopamine D1 , D2S , D2L , D3 , D4 and D5 and 5- Q13049 and P28335 receptors and rat P50406 and P34969 receptors . DB04946 displayed higher affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor ( Ki = 7.1 nM ) than for the dopamine D4 receptor ( Ki = 25 nM ) . DB04946 displayed high affinity for the P50406 and P34969 receptors ( Ki = 42.7 and 21.6 nM , respectively ) , and was found to have higher affinity for the 5- Q13049 ( Ki = 5.6 nM ) than for the P28335 receptor ( Ki = 42.8 nM ) . The potential implications of this receptor binding profile are discussed in comparison with data for other antipsychotic compounds .
