Differential activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma by troglitazone and rosiglitazone . The antidiabetic thiazolidinediones , which include troglitazone and rosiglitazone , are ligands for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma and exert their antihyperglycemic effects by regulation of P37231 -responsive genes . We report here that P37231 activation by troglitazone depends on the experimental setting . DB00197 acts as a partial agonist for P37231 in transfected muscle ( C2C12 ) and kidney ( P29320 293T ) cells , producing a submaximal transcriptional response ( 1.8- to 2.5-fold activation ) compared with rosiglitazone ( 7.4- to 13-fold activation ) . Additionally , troglitazone antagonizes rosiglitazone-stimulated P37231 transcriptional activity . Limited protease digestion of P37231 suggests conformational differences in the receptor bound to troglitazone versus rosiglitazone . Consistent with this finding , an in vitro coactivator association assay demonstrated that troglitazone-bound P37231 recruited the transcriptional coactivators p300 and steroid receptor coactivator 1 less efficiently than rosiglitazone-bound receptor . In contrast to these observations , troglitazone behaves as a full agonist of P37231 in 3T3L1 adipocytes . Two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis demonstrated that troglitazone and rosiglitazone regulated distinct but overlapping sets of genes in several cell types . Thus , troglitazone may behave as a partial agonist under certain physiological circumstances and as a full agonist in others . These differences could be caused by variations in the amount of specific cofactors , differences in Q07869 response elements , or the presence of different isoforms of P37231 .
