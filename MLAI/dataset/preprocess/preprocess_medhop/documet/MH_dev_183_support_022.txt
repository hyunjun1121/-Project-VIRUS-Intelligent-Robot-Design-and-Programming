Transforming growth factor-alpha directly augments histidine decarboxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 production in rat enterochromaffin-like cells . For the production and vesicle storage of histamine , Enterochromaffin-like ( ECL ) cells express histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( Q05940 ) . Although HDC and Q05940 show dynamic changes during gastric ulcer healing , the control system of their expression has not been fully investigated . In the present study , we investigated the effect of transforming growth factor-alpha ( TGF-alpha ) and proinflammatory cytokines on HDC and Q05940 expression in rat ECL cells . Time course changes in the expression of TGF-alpha during the healing of acetic acid-induced ulcers were studied . P01133 receptor ( P00533 ) expression was also examined in ECL cells , whereas the direct effects of TGF-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines on HDC and Q05940 expression in ECL cells were investigated using in vivo and in vitro models . During the process of ulcer healing , expression of TGF-alpha mRNA was markedly augmented . Furthermore , P00533 was identified in isolated ECL cells . TGF-alpha stimulated HDC and Q05940 mRNA expression and protein production and also increased histamine release from ECL cells . Selective P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 almost completely inhibited HDC and Q05940 gene expression induced by TGF-alpha in vivo and in vitro . During gastric mucosal injury , TGF-alpha was found to stimulate ECL cell functions by increasing HDC and Q05940 expression .
