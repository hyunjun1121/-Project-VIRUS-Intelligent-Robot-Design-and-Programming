P10275 inducing bladder cancer progression by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition . The study investigated the role of androgen receptor ( AR ) as a potential target for the treatment of bladder cancer in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transformation ( EMT ) . Cell proliferation , and migration capacity were determined in bladder cancer T24 cells treated with small interfering RNA directed against AR , and expression levels of P12830 , β-catenin and N- cadherin were assessed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . Tumour cell growth was evaluated in vivo in T24 tumour-bearing nude mice receiving electroporation-assisted administration of anti-AR small interfering RNA . It was found that low AR expression decreased proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells . In vivo experiments showed that silencing AR expression significantly suppressed AR-positive bladder tumour growth with decreased cell proliferation . Low AR level of T24 bladder cancer cells treated with DB01541 ( DB02901 ) decreased expression of P12830 , β-catenin and P19022 expression , indicating a strong sensitivity to the EMT and In cells with low AR content , TGF-β induced down-regulation of P12830 and β-catenin . It is concluded that suppression of AR expression decreased the production of TGF-β , inhibiting EMT and bladder cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo , implying that its use might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of bladder cancer .
