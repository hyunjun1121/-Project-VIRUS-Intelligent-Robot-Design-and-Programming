Leptin resistance in vagal afferent neurons inhibits cholecystokinin signaling and satiation in diet induced obese rats . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : The gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin ( CCK ) plays an important role in regulating meal size and duration by activating CCK1 receptors on vagal afferent neurons ( Q15025 ) . Leptin enhances CCK signaling in Q15025 via an early growth response 1 ( P18146 ) dependent pathway thereby increasing their sensitivity to CCK . In response to a chronic ingestion of a high fat diet , Q15025 develop leptin resistance and the satiating effects of CCK are reduced . We tested the hypothesis that leptin resistance in Q15025 is responsible for reducing CCK signaling and satiation . RESULTS : Lean Zucker rats sensitive to leptin signaling , significantly reduced their food intake following administration of CCK8S ( 0.22 nmol/kg , i.p. ) , while obese Zucker rats , insensitive to leptin , did not . CCK signaling in Q15025 of obese Zucker rats was reduced , preventing CCK-induced up-regulation of P49146 and down-regulation of melanin concentrating hormone 1 receptor ( Q99705 ) and cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) . In Q15025 from diet-induced obese ( DIO ) Sprague Dawley rats , previously shown to become leptin resistant , we demonstrated that the reduction in P18146 expression resulted in decreased sensitivity of Q15025 to CCK and reduced CCK-induced inhibition of food intake . The lowered sensitivity of Q15025 to CCK in DIO rats resulted in a decrease in P28062 expression and increased P21554 and Q99705 expression . These effects coincided with the onset of hyperphagia in DIO rats . CONCLUSIONS : Leptin signaling in Q15025 is required for appropriate CCK signaling and satiation . In response to high fat feeding , the onset of leptin resistance reduces the sensitivity of Q15025 to CCK thus reducing the satiating effects of CCK .
