Impaired MEK signaling and SERCA expression promote ER stress and apoptosis in insulin-resistant macrophages and are reversed by exenatide treatment . Accumulation of toxic lipids evokes the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and apoptotic death of macrophages and vascular cells in atherosclerotic plaques . Primary macrophages from insulin-resistant ob/ob and insulin receptor ( Insr ) (-/-) mice display increased apoptosis in response to loading with free cholesterol or oxysterol , but underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated . We show increased activation of all three major branches of the UPR in response to free cholesterol or oxysterol loading in insulin-resistant macrophages . Inhibition and rescue experiments revealed that defective MEK/extracellular signal\x{2013}related kinase ( P29323 ) / DB02527 -responsive element-binding protein ( CREBP ) signaling in insulin-resistant macrophages leads to decreased expression of sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Ca(2+)-ATPase , depletion of ER calcium stores , P19525 -like ER kinase activation , and ER stress-associated apoptosis . Activation of macrophage glucagon-like peptide 1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptor via the antidiabetic drug exenatide led to improvements in both P29323 and AKT signaling and reversed the increase in UPR and apoptosis of insulin-resistant macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of ob/ob.Ldlr(-/-) and Insr(-/-).Ldlr(-/-) mice . Increased signaling via P43220 or the CREBP activator protein kinase A thus offers a way to rescue insulin-resistant macrophages from excessive ER stress responses and apoptosis in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes .
