P01308 /FGF-binding ciliary membrane glycoprotein from Tetrahymena . Triton X-100 extracted ciliary membrane protein from isolated cilia , prepared from the protozoon Tetrahymena thermophila , were fractionated by affinity chromatography on columns with covalently bound fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , insulin , or concanavalin A ( ConA ) , respectively . The eluted proteins were further analyzed by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels , isoelectric focusing , and by immunoblotting techniques using antibodies against the FGF receptor , platetelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor alpha-subunit , and insulin receptor beta-subunit . The particular antibodies were chosen because the peptides PDGF , FGF , insulin , and ConA are chemoattractants in this organism and corresponding binding ( receptor ) proteins could be expected to be identified . A 66 kDa protein fraction was eluted from the FGF-MiniLeak agarose , insulin-MiniLeak agarose and ConA sepharose . This fraction responded in Western immunoblots to an antibody against the beta-subunit of the human insulin receptor , to an antibody against the PDGF receptor ( P09619 ) and also to an antibody against the bovine FGF receptor ( FGFR ) that is known , in other systems , to inhibit FGF binding to its receptor . When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue the 66 kDa fraction appeared as a single component . However , in some experiments it appeared more heterogeneous when stained with silver indicating the presence of minor components that may be a procedural artifact or isoforms of the same glycoprotein . The 66 kDa protein(s) migrated in isoelectric focusing with a pI of 7.4 . The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of the 66 kDa glycoprotein as a protein involved in peptide-mediated cell signalling .
