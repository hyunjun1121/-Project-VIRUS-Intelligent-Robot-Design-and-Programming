Systems pharmacology dissection of the anti-inflammatory mechanism for the medicinal herb Folium eriobotryae . Inflammation is a hallmark of many diseases like diabetes , cancers , atherosclerosis and arthritis . Thus , lots of concerns have been raised toward developing novel anti-inflammatory agents . Many alternative herbal medicines possess excellent anti-inflammatory properties , yet their precise mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated . Here , a novel systems pharmacology approach based on a large number of chemical , biological and pharmacological data was developed and exemplified by a probe herb Folium Eriobotryae , a widely used clinical anti-inflammatory botanic drug . The results show that 11 ingredients of this herb with favorable pharmacokinetic properties are predicted as active compounds for anti-inflammatory treatment . In addition , via systematic network analyses , their targets are identified to be 43 inflammation-associated proteins including especially P35354 , P09917 , P37231 , P01375 and Q04206 that are mainly involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway , the rheumatoid arthritis pathway and NF-ÎºB signaling pathway . All these demonstrate that the integrated systems pharmacology method provides not only an effective tool to illustrate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of herbs , but also a new systems-based approach for drug discovery from , but not limited to , herbs , especially when combined with further experimental validations .
