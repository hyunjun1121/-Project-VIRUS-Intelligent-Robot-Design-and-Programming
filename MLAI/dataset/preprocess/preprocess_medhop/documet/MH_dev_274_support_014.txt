Mapping four genes from human chromosome 4 to porcine chromosome 8 further develops the comparative map for an economically important chromosome of the swine genome . Because porcine chromosome ( SSC ) 8 has become the focal point of many efforts aimed at identifying quantitative trait loci affecting ovulation rate , genes distributed across human chromosome ( HSA ) 4 were physically mapped in the pig . A more refined comparative map of this region for these two species was produced . In this study , four genes were selected based on their location in the human genome , the availability of nucleotide sequence and their genomic organization . The genes selected were fibroblast growth factor basic ( P09038 ; HSA 4q25-27 ) , gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ( P30968 ; HSA 4q13 ) , phosphodiesterase 6 B ( P35913 ; HSA 4p16.3 ) and aminopeptidase S ( P28838 ; HSA 4p11-q12 ) . Genomic libraries were screened via PCR and clones were physically assigned using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) . These four genes from HSA 4 were physically mapped to SSC 8p2.3 ( P35913 ) , 8p1.1 ( P28838 ) , 8q1.1-1.2 ( P30968 ) and 8q2.2-2.4 ( P09038 ) . These assignments provide additional benchmarks for the comparative map and help define the level of gene order conserved between HSA 4 and SSC 8 .
