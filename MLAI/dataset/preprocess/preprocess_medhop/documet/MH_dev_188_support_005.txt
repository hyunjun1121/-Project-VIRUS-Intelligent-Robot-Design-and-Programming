Association of luteinizing hormone receptor ( LHR ) mRNA with its binding protein leads to decapping and degradation of the mRNA in the p bodies . P22888 undergoes downregulation during preovulatory DB00044 surge through a post-transcriptional mechanism involving an RNA binding protein designated as LRBP . The present study examined the mechanism by which LRBP induces the degradation of P22888 mRNA , specifically the role of decapping of P22888 mRNA and the translocation of LRBP-bound P22888 mRNA to degradative machinery . Immunoprecipitation of the complex with the 5'cap structure antibody followed by real time PCR analysis showed progressive loss of capped P22888 mRNA during downregulation suggesting that P22888 mRNA undergoes decapping prior to degradation . RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed dissociation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E from the cap structure , a step required for decapping . Furthermore , RNA immunoprecipitation analysis using antibody against the p body marker protein , Q9NPI6 showed that P22888 mRNA was associated with the p bodies , the cytoplasmic foci that contain RNA degradative enzymes and decapping complex . Immunohistochemical studies using antibodies against LRBP and Q9NPI6 followed by confocal analysis showed colocalization of LRBP with Q9NPI6 during downregulation . This was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of LRBP with Q9NPI6 . The association of LRBP and P22888 mRNA in the p bodies during downregulation was further confirmed by examining the association of a second p body component , rck/p54 , using immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation respectively . These data suggest that the association of LRBP with P22888 mRNA results in the translocation of the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex to the p bodies leading to decapping and degradation .
