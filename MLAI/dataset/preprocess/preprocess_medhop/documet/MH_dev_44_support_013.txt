P05019 stimulates human intestinal smooth muscle cell growth by regulation of P55008 phase cell cycle proteins . Autocrine production of insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) regulates growth of human intestinal muscle cells by activation of distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -kinase ) -dependent and P27361 /2-dependent pathways . The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms by which P05019 regulates the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and muscle cell proliferation . Incubation of quiescent cells with P05019 stimulated time-dependent cell cycle progression measured by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine . Studies using a microarray-based approach were used initially to identify genes expressed in human intestinal muscle encoding proteins known to participate in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle that were regulated by P05019 . Incubation of muscle cells for 24 h with P05019 elicited greater than fivefold increase in the expression of cyclin D1 and greater than twofold increase in retinoblastoma protein ( Rb1 ) . P05019 elicited a time-dependent increase in cyclin D1 protein levels mediated jointly by P27361 /2-dependent and P19957 -kinase-dependent mechanisms . Increase in cyclin D1 levels was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in cyclin D1-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase-4 ( P11802 ) activity . P05019 also elicited a rapid time-dependent increase in Rb-(Ser807/811) phosphorylation , the specific target of the cyclin D(1)-dependent P11802 kinase , and a slower increase in total Rb protein levels . We conclude that P05019 stimulates G(1) phase progression , DNA synthesis , and cell proliferation of human intestinal smooth muscle cells . Effects of P05019 on proliferation are mediated jointly by P27361 /2-dependent and P19957 -kinase-dependent pathways that regulate cyclin D1 levels , P11802 activity , and Rb activity .
