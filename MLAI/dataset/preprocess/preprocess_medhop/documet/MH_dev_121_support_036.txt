Inflammation-mediated abrogation of androgen signaling : an in vitro model of prostate cell inflammation . As a link between inflammation and cancer has been reported in many studies , we established an in vitro model of prostatic inflammation to investigate the loss of androgen receptor ( AR ) -mediated signaling in androgen responsive prostate cell lines . First , the U937 monocyte cell line was differentiated into macrophages using phorbol acetate ( PMA ) , and cells were induced with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) for cytokine secretion . Next , the cytokine levels ( P01375 α , P05231 , and IL1β ) in conditioned media ( CM ) were analyzed . Prostate cells were then fed with CM containing varying concentrations of P01375 α , and IkB degradation , nuclear factor kappa B ( NFκB ) translocation and transactivation , and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 ( P22894 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) were then assessed . As a result of CM treatment , ubiquitin-mediated AR degradation , which was restored using anti- P01375 α antibody neutralization , led to both a decrease in Q9Y5K2 , PSA , and Q99801 expression levels and the upregulation of P18283 . In addition to the loss of AR , acute and chronic CM exposure resulted in p53 degradation and consequent P38936 downregulation , which was also restored by either androgen administration or ectopic Q99801 expression via the stabilization of Q00987 levels in LNCaP cells . Additionally , CM treatment enhanced P16104 ( ( S139 ) ) phosphorylation ( a hallmark of DNA damage ) and genetic heterogeneity in the absence of androgens in prostate cells without activating mitochondrial apoptosis . Thus , the data suggest that inflammatory cytokine exposure results in the loss of AR and p53 signaling in prostate cells and facilitates genetic heterogeneity via ROS accumulation to promote prostate carcinogenesis .
