Q02750 /2 inhibition attenuates vascular P25101 and ETB receptor alterations after cerebral ischaemia . Cerebral ischaemia is associated with elevated levels of endothelin B ( ETB ) receptors in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) . This up-regulation of ET receptors occurs via de novo transcription involving mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) . The aim of this study was to examine the effect of inhibition of the Q96HU1 kinase/ P29323 kinase (MEK)1/2 on ET receptor alteration , brain damage , and neurology in experimental cerebral ischaemia . Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) was induced in male Wistar rats by the intraluminal filament technique . The animals received 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally of the Q02750 /2 inhibitor U0126 or vehicle in conjunction with the occlusion . After 24 h , the rats were decapitated and the brains removed . The middle cerebral arteries were dissected out and examined with myographs or immunohistochemistry . The ischaemic areas of the brains were compared . After the MCAO , the contractile responses of the P25101 and ETB receptors were augmented in the ipsilateral MCA . U0126 decreased this alteration in ET receptor response . Furthermore , treatment with U0126 significantly decreased the brain damage and improved neurological scores . Immunohistochemistry showed that there were lower protein levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( P29323 )1/2 and phosphorylated transcription factor Elk-1 in the U0126-treated rats compared to control . The results show that treatment with the Q02750 /2 inhibitor U0126 in ischaemic stroke decreases brain damage , neurological symptoms , and ET receptor alteration . The vascular effects of U0126 provide new perspective on possible mechanisms of actions of MAPK inhibition in cerebral ischaemia .
