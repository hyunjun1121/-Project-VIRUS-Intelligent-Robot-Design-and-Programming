P00747 activator inhibitor-1 is increased in colonic epithelial cells from patients with colitis-associated cancer . BACKGROUND : Patients with long-term ulcerative colitis are at risk for developing colorectal cancer . METHODS : Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from ulcerative colitis patients who underwent a colectomy for high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma was examined for changes in expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) as well as other mediators of inflammation-associated cancer . Epithelia from areas of colons that showed histologic evidence of carcinoma , high-grade dysplasia , and epithelia that were not dysplastic or malignant but did contain evidence of prior inflammation ( quiescent colitis ) was microdissected using laser capture microscopy . mRNA was extracted from the microdissected tissue and PCR array analysis was performed . To extend our findings , P05121 protein levels were determined using immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : The mRNA expression of P05121 is increased 6-fold ( p=0.02 ) when comparing the carcinoma group to the quiescent colitis group ; increases were also observed in Q00653 , Q04864 , P12931 , and P15692 . The protein levels of P05121 are increased by 50 % ( p < 0.001 ) in high-grade dysplasia and by 60 % ( p < 0.001 ) in carcinoma when compared to the quiescent colitis group . CONCLUSIONS : The increase in P05121 in high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma suggests a functional role for P05121 in malignant transformation in colitis-associated cancer . P05121 could also prove a useful diagnostic marker to identify patients at risk for neoplasia and it may be a useful therapeutic target to treat colitis-associated cancer .
