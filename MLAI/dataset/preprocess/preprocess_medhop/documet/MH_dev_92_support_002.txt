P10275 -dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells : role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt pathway . The mechanisms of testosterone-induced vasodilatation are not fully understood . This study investigated the effect of testosterone on nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis and its molecular mechanism using human aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC ) . DB00624 at physiological concentrations ( 1-100 nm ) induced a rapid ( 15-30 min ) increase in NO production , which was associated with phosphorylation and activation of endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) . Then , the involvement of the androgen receptor ( AR ) , which is abundantly expressed in HAEC , was examined . The effect of testosterone on P29474 activation and NO production were abolished by pretreatment with an AR antagonist nilutamide and by transfection with AR small interference RNA . In contrast , testosterone-induced P29474 phosphorylation was unchanged by pretreatment with an aromatase inhibitor or by transfection with ERalpha small interference RNA . DB02901 , a nonaromatizable androgen , also stimulated P29474 phosphorylation . Next , the signaling cascade that leads to P29474 phosphorylation was explored . DB00624 stimulated rapid phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and dose-dependent manner , with maximal response at 15-60 min . The rapid phosphorylation of P29474 or NO production induced by testosterone was inhibited by Akt inhibitor SH-5 or by phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin . Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a testosterone-dependent interaction between AR and the p85alpha subunit of P19957 -kinase . In conclusion , testosterone rapidly induces NO production via AR-dependent activation of P29474 in HAEC . Activation of P19957 -kinase/Akt signaling and the direct interaction of AR with p85alpha are involved , at least in part , in P29474 phosphorylation .
