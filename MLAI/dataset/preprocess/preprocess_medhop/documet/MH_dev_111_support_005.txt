The antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on human tongue cancer cells with inhibition of the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor . Local anesthetics suppress proliferation in several cancer cells . The mechanism of the suppression , however , is unknown . Our previous study shows that lidocaine , at the level of tissue concentration under topical or local administration , has a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , which is a potential target for antiproliferation in cancer cells . Therefore , we hypothesized that lidocaine would suppress the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of P00533 activity . We investigated the effects of lidocaine ( 40-4000 microM ) on proliferation of a human tongue cancer cell line , CAL27 , which has a high level of P00533 expression , and also examined the effect of lidocaine on epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) -stimulated autophosphorylation of P00533 in CAL27 cells . A clinical concentration of lidocaine ( 400 microM ) suppressed both serum-induced and P01133 -induced proliferation of CAL27 cells and inhibited P01133 -stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of P00533 without cytotoxicity . A larger concentration of lidocaine ( 4000 microM ) showed cytotoxicity with an antiproliferative effect . We suggest that the inhibition of P01133 -stimulated P00533 activity is one of the mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of lidocaine on CAL27 cells . DB00281 administered topically within the oral cavity for cancer pain relief may suppress the proliferation of human tongue cancer cells .
