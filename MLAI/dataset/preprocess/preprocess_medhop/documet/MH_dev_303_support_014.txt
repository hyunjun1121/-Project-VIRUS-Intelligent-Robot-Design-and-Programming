Roxithromycin is an inhibitor of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells proliferation : a potential ability to prevent coronary heart disease . Roxithromycin ( RXM ) , a macrolide antibiotic , is used in clinical trials to address secondary prevention of coronary heart disease . However , the effects of RXM on human coronary artery smooth muscle cells ( CASMC ) proliferation remain unclear . Human CASMC were stimulated with growth medium containing 5 % fetal bovine serum and growth factors . RXM at 1 or 10 microg/ml , which are relevant to the therapeutic plasma levels , significantly suppressed mitogen-induced CASMC proliferation , assessed by WST-1 assay and cell counting . Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that RXM suppressed mitogen-induced P55008 to S progression on cell cycle . Western blot showed that RXM inhibited phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene products , reduced protein levels of cyclin D1 and A , and restored downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p27kip1 . The activities of P11802 and P24941 were suppressed by RXM without affecting their protein levels . When transfected with both O15111 alpha and beta constructs as nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) activator , CASMC entered S phase at 24 h , and RXM inhibited it . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunostaining of NF-kappaB p65 demonstrated that RXM inhibited mitogen-induced NF-kappaB activation . These results indicate that RXM is an inhibitor of human CASMC proliferation through modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
