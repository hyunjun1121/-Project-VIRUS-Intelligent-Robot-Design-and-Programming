Genome-wide association of early-onset myocardial infarction with single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants . We conducted a genome-wide association study testing single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and copy number variants ( CNVs ) for association with early-onset myocardial infarction in 2,967 cases and 3,075 controls . We carried out replication in an independent sample with an effective sample size of up to 19,492 . SNPs at nine loci reached genome-wide significance : three are newly identified ( 21q22 near P82932 - P53794 - Q9Y6J6 , 6p24 in Q9C0D0 and 2q33 in Q9GZL7 ) and six replicated prior observations ( 9p21 , 1p13 near Q9HCU4 - Q6PGN9 - Q99523 , 10q11 near P48061 , 1q41 in Q5JRA6 , 19p13 near P01130 and 1p32 near Q8NBP7 ) . We tested 554 common copy number polymorphisms ( > 1 % allele frequency ) and none met the pre-specified threshold for replication ( P < 10(-3) ) . We identified 8,065 rare CNVs but did not detect a greater CNV burden in cases compared to controls , in genes compared to the genome as a whole , or at any individual locus . SNPs at nine loci were reproducibly associated with myocardial infarction , but tests of common and rare CNVs failed to identify additional associations with myocardial infarction risk .
