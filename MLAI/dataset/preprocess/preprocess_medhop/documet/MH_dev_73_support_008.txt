The stimulation of ketogenesis by cannabinoids in cultured astrocytes defines carnitine palmitoyltransferase I as a new ceramide-activated enzyme . The effects of cannabinoids on ketogenesis in primary cultures of rat astrocytes were studied . Delta9- DB00470 ( THC ) , the major active component of marijuana , produced a malonyl- DB01992 -independent stimulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I ( CPT-I ) and ketogenesis from [14C]palmitate . The THC-induced stimulation of ketogenesis was mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 and was prevented by pertussis toxin and the P21554 cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716 . Experiments performed with different cellular modulators indicated that the THC-induced stimulation of ketogenesis was independent of cyclic AMP , Ca2+ , protein kinase C , and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . The possible involvement of ceramide in the activation of ketogenesis by cannabinoids was subsequently studied . THC produced a P21554 receptor-dependent stimulation of sphingomyelin breakdown that was concomitant to an elevation of intracellular ceramide levels . Addition of exogenous sphingomyelinase to the astrocyte culture medium led to a MAPK-independent activation of ketogenesis that was quantitatively similar and not additive to that exerted by THC . Furthermore , ceramide activated CPT-I in astrocyte mitochondria . Results thus indicate that cannabinoids stimulate ketogenesis in astrocytes by a mechanism that may rely on P21554 receptor activation , sphingomyelin hydrolysis , and ceramide-mediated activation of CPT-I .
