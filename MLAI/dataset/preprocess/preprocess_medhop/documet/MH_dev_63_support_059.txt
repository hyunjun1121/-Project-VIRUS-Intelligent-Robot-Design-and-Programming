The mechanism of the G0/ P55008 cell cycle phase arrest induced by activation of O75469 in human cells . CONTEXT : O75469 ( O75469 ) is an important transcriptional regulator that plays important roles in the cell metabolism and cell growth by regulating the transcriptional of a sort of metabolizing enzymes . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether rifampicin effected HepG2 cells growth and the inhibition was due to the G0/ P55008 phase arrest . METHODS : O75469 -knockdown experiments using RNAi showed that the cell cycle phase arrest mediated by rifampicin based on activation of O75469 . The results also indicated that cell phase arrest by rifampicin could protect cells form UVB-induced DNA damage . P19793 ( RXRα ) expression level in cells is another key factor for cell cycle phase arrest mediated by rifampicin . Both over expression and lacking expression of RXRα in cell reduced the cell arrest efficiency mediated by rifampicin . In the study , we found that rifampicin inhibited HepG2 cells growth and demonstrated that the inhibition is due to the G0/ P55008 phase arrest through flow cytometry analysis . CONCLUSION : The results showed that RXRα promote cell cycle phase transition rate of HepG2 . Competitive bind of rifampicin-activated O75469 with RXRα is one main reason to arrest cell cycle phase through inhibiting combination of RXRα with other partners . DB01045 could promote cell growth rate when RXRα expressed more excessively than O75469 in cells .
