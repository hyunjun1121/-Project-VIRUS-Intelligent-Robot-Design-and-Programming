Identification of a novel extracellular cation-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor . The C family G-protein-coupled receptors contain members that sense amino acid and extracellular cations , of which calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) is the prototypic extracellular calcium-sensing receptor . Some cells , such as osteoblasts in bone , retain responsiveness to extracellular calcium in P41180 -deficient mice , consistent with the existence of another calcium-sensing receptor . We examined the calcium-sensing properties of Q5T6X5 , a newly identified member of this family . Alignment of Q5T6X5 with P41180 revealed conservation of both calcium and calcimimetic binding sites . In addition , calcium , magnesium , strontium , aluminum , gadolinium , and the calcimimetic P0C0P6 568 resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of Q5T6X5 overexpressed in human embryonic kidney cells 293 cells . Also , osteocalcin , a calcium-binding protein highly expressed in bone , dose-dependently stimulated Q5T6X5 activity in the presence of calcium but inhibited the calcium-dependent activation of P41180 . Coexpression of beta-arrestins 1 and 2 , regulators of G-protein signaling P41220 or P49798 , the RhoA inhibitor P01024 toxin , the dominant negative Galpha(q)-(305-359) minigene , and pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited activation of Q5T6X5 by extracellular cations . Reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed that mouse Q5T6X5 is widely expressed in mouse tissues , including bone , calvaria , and the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 . These data suggest that in addition to sensing amino acids , Q5T6X5 is a cation- , calcimimetic- , and osteocalcin-sensing receptor and a candidate for mediating extracellular calcium-sensing responses in osteoblasts and possibly other tissues .
