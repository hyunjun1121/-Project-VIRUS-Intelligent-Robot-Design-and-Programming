Nimotuzumab suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhances apoptosis in low-dose UV-C treated salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines in vitro . Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma ( SACC ) , which is one of the most common malignant tumors of the salivary glands , is associated with a poor long-term outcome . There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with SACC . Recent studies have shown the potential of the application of ultraviolet-C ( UV-C ) irradiation for the treatment of human cancer . In the present study , we investigated the effects of UV-C in the SACC cell lines SACC-83 and SACC-LM . High-dose UV-C ( 200 J/m ) induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation significantly . However , low-dose UV-C ( 10 J/m ) , which had little effect on apoptosis and colony formation , increased the ability of migration in SACC cells accompanied by a decrease in P12830 and an increase in vimentin , suggesting the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Low-dose UV-C ( 10 J/m ) also resulted in upregulation of the phosphorylated forms of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and Akt ( p- P00533 and p-Akt , respectively ) . Pretreatment with Nimotuzumab , an anti- P00533 monoclonal antibody , reversed the EMT as well as upregulation of p- P00533 /p-Akt induced by UV-C . Moreover , Nimotuzumab enhanced UV-C induced apoptosis and inhibition of colony formation . Our results indicate that EMT exerts a protective effect against apoptosis induced by low-dose UV-C . Thus , the combined application of Nimotuzumab and low-dose UV-C in vitro has an advantageous antitumor effect in SACC compared with the application of UV-C alone .
