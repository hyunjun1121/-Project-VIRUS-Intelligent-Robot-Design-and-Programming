Association of indices of liver and adipocyte insulin resistance with 19 confirmed susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes in 6,733 non-diabetic Finnish men . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Of the confirmed type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci only a few are known to affect insulin sensitivity . We examined the association of indices of hepatic and adipocyte insulin resistance ( IR ) with 19 confirmed type 2 diabetes risk loci in a large population-based study . METHODS : Non-diabetic participants ( n = 8,460 , age 57.3 ± 7.0 years , BMI 26.8 ± 3.8 kg/m(2) ; mean ± SD ) from a population-based cohort underwent an OGTT . Of them , 6,733 non-diabetic men were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in or near PPARG2 ( also known as P37231 ) , Q14654 , Q9NQB0 , Q8IWU4 , Q03014 , P42772 , Q9Y6M1 , Q5VV42 , P35680 , O76024 , Q86VZ6 , O75794 , P19075 , Q6YHU6 , Q9P2N4 , Q04721 , P51787 , P49286 and SNP rs7480010 . We investigated hepatic IR with a new index of liver IR . The adipocyte IR index was defined as a product of fasting P80303 and plasma insulin levels . RESULTS : Type 2 diabetes risk SNPs in or near Q14654 and Q03014 were significantly ( p < 0.0013 ) , and those in or near P42772 , Q04721 and P49286 were nominally ( p < 0.05 ) , associated with decreased liver IR index . The Pro12 allele of PPARG2 was significantly associated with a high adipocyte IR index and nominally associated with high liver IR . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : The Pro12 allele of PPARG2 seems to impair insulin 's antilipolytic effect , leading to high P80303 release in the fasting state and IR . In addition , the type 2 diabetes risk alleles of Q14654 and Q03014 , which are known to impair insulin secretion , were associated with increased hepatic insulin sensitivity .
