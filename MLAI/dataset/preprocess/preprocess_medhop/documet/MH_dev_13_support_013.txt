[ Activation of coagulation cascade in children during an idiopathic nephrotic syndrome relapse ] . The objective of this study was to assess concentrations of selected markers of coagulation in children with relapse of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome during a 6-week therapy . Study groups : 22 subjects ( 32 relapses ) -- 14 males , 8 females ( mean age 7.15 +/- 1.5 y. ) with no thrombotic complications were included into the study . All children were clinically steroid-sensitive . METHODS : Coagulation markers ( platelet count , thrombin time , APTT , INR , fibrinogen 1 + 2 fragments ( F1 + 2 ) , thrombin-antithrombin complexes ( TAT ) , serum levels of D-dimer ( DD ) , fibrin monomers ( FM ) and antithrombin activity ( P01008 ) ) were measured three times : on admission , after 2 and 6 weeks . The control group consisted of 13 healthy children . RESULTS : Serum concentration of TAT or F1 + 2 did not differ between 3 stages ( p > 0.05 ) . However , values at 0 and 2 weeks were significantly higher than in control group ( p < 0.05 ) . We found no correlation between TAT or F1 + 2 and FBG , ALB , TCH , TG levels . [ table : see text ] CONCLUSIONS : The coagulation cascade in relapse of NS was activated during first 6 weeks of therapy whereas metabolic disturbances ( low ALB , high P02675 , TCH , TG , high platelets ) normalized . It is speculative whether it was caused by active immunological process but definitely it resulted in " prothrombotic state " in P01308 patients .
