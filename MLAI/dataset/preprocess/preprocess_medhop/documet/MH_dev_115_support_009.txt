Inhibition of P23458 , 2/ P40763 signaling induces apoptosis , cell cycle arrest , and reduces tumor cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells . Abnormalities in the P40763 pathway are involved in the oncogenesis of several cancers . However , the mechanism by which dysregulated P40763 signaling contributes to the progression of human colorectal cancer ( CRC ) has not been elucidated , nor has the role of JAK , the physiological activator of P40763 , been evaluated . To investigate the role of both JAK and P40763 in CRC progression , we inhibited JAK with AG490 and depleted P40763 with a SiRNA . Our results demonstrate that P40763 and both P23458 and 2 are involved in CRC cell growth , survival , invasion , and migration through regulation of gene expression , such as Bcl-2 , p1(6ink4a) , P38936 (waf1/cip1) , p27(kip1) , P12830 , P15692 , and MMPs . Importantly , the Q05397 is not required for P40763 -mediated regulation , but does function downstream of JAK . In addition , our data show that proteasome-mediated proteolysis promotes dephosphorylation of the O60674 , and consequently , negatively regulates P40763 signaling in CRC . Moreover , immunohistochemical staining reveals that nuclear staining of phospho- P40763 mostly presents in adenomas and adenocarcinomas , and a positive correlation is found between phospho- O60674 immunoreactivity and the differentiation of colorectal adenocarcinomas . Therefore , our findings illustrate the biologic significance of P23458 , 2/ P40763 signaling in CRC progression and provide novel evidence that the JAK/ P40763 pathway may be a new potential target for therapy of CRC .
