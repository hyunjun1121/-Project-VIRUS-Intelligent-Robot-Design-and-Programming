DB08916 : emerging next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor for NSCLC . The discovery of epidermal growth-factor receptor ( P00533 ) -activating mutations and the introduction of oral P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( P00533 -TKIs ) have expanded the treatment options for patients with non-small cell lung cancer . The first two reversible P00533 -TKIs , erlotinib and gefitinib , are approved for use in the first-line setting in patients with known P00533 -activating mutations and in the second- and third-line settings for all NSCLC patients . These first-generation P00533 -TKIs improve progression-free survival when compared to chemotherapy in patients with P00533 -activating mutations in the first-line setting . However , nearly all patients develop resistance to P00533 -directed agents . There is a need for further therapy options for patients with disease progression after treatment with reversible P00533 -TKIs . DB08916 is an irreversible ErbB family blocker that inhibits P00533 , P04626 , and Q15303 . In vitro and in vivo , afatinib have shown increased inhibition of the common P00533 -activating mutations as well as the T790M resistance mutation when compared to erlotinib and gefitinib . Clinically , afatinib has been evaluated in the LUX-Lung series of trials , with improvement in progression-free survival reported in patients with P00533 -activating mutations in both first- and second-/third-line settings when compared to chemotherapy . Further investigation is needed to determine the precise role that afatinib will play in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and P00533 -activating mutations .
