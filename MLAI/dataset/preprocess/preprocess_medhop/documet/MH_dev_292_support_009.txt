Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system downregulates tissue factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in human breast carcinoma cells . INTRODUCTION : The renin-angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) promotes angiogenesis and growth of neoplastic cells . P12821 ( P12821 ) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor AT1 blockers may protect against cancer . P13726 ( TF ) , for its involvement in tumor growth , angiogenesis , and metastasis is considered a hallmark of cancer progression . In this study we evaluated whether DB01367 blockade modulates TF constitutive expression by the metastatic breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell line . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Cell TF activity was assessed by one stage clotting time , TF and P15692 antigens and mRNA levels by ELISA and RT-PCR , respectively . AT(1) was detected by flow-cytometry and angiotensin-II levels by EIA . RESULTS : DB01197 reduced in a concentration-dependent way both the strong constitutive TF activity ( 983.2±55.2 vs. 686.7±135.1U/5×10(5) cells with 10μg/ml captopril ) and antigen ( 32.3±5.9 vs. 13.2±6.6ng/ml ) in MDA-MB-231 . Similar results were observed with enalapril . AT1 was present on cell membrane and losartan , a competitive inhibitor of AT1 , reduced TF expression to a degree similar as that exerted by P12821 inhibitors . Moreover , captopril and losartan downregulated the constitutive mRNA TF expression by ~35 % . Similar results were observed with anti-AT1 and angiotensin II antibodies . In addition , the constitutive P15692 antigen and mRNA levels were reduced in the presence of captopril or losartan , and an anti- P15692 antibody downregulated cell TF activity by ~40 % . CONCLUSIONS : These results could , at least in part , contribute to the discussion about the possible effects of P12821 inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists in malignancy , and offer new clues to support their use for tumor control .
