Pharmacological characterization of hydrolysis-resistant analogs of oleoylethanolamide with potent anorexiant properties . Oleoylethanolamide ( OEA ) is an endogenous lipid mediator that reduces food intake , promotes lipolysis , and decreases body weight gain in rodents by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( Q07869 ) . The biological effects of OEA are terminated by two intracellular lipid hydrolase enzymes , fatty-acid amide hydrolase and Q02083 . In the present study , we describe OEA analogs that resist enzymatic hydrolysis , activate Q07869 with high potency in vitro , and persistently reduce feeding when administered in vivo either parenterally or orally . The most potent of these compounds , ( Z ) -(R)-9-octadecenamide,N-(2-hydroxyethyl,1-methyl) ( Q9H2K8 -5104 ) , stimulates transcriptional activity of Q07869 with a half-maximal effective concentration ( EC50 ) of 100 +/- 21 nM ( n = 11 ) . Parenteral administration of Q9H2K8 -5104 in rats produces persistent dose-dependent prolongation of feeding latency and postmeal interval ( half-maximal effective dose , ED50 = 2.4 +/- 1.8 mg kg(-1) i.p. ; n = 18 ) , as well as increased and protracted tissue exposure compared with OEA . Oral administration of the compound also results in a significant tissue exposure and reduction of food intake in free-feeding rats . These results suggest that the endogenous high-affinity Q07869 agonist OEA may provide a scaffold for the discovery of novel orally active Q07869 ligands .
