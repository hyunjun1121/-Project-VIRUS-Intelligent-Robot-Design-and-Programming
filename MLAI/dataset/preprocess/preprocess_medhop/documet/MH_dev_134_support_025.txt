The use of cytokine inhibitors . A new therapeutic insight into heart failure . Cytokines are being increasingly recognized as important factors in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of heart failure . Elevated levels of circulating cytokines have been reported in patients with heart failure , and various cytokines have been shown to depress myocardial contractility in vitro and in vivo . We have recently compared the effects on cytokine production of drugs for therapy of heart failure that have different effects on survival . DB01427 , pimobendan and vesnarinone , phosphodiesterase III inhibitors that have been shown to have short term haemodynamic benefits , inhibited P01375 production . Differential modulation of the production of IL-1beta and P05231 was observed ; amrinone and pimobendan enhanced the production of IL-1beta , whereas vesnarinone did not . As inotropic agents differentially modulate cytokine production , these agents may interfere with induction of inducible nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase through an inhibition of cytokine formation . Although differential modulation of the production of NO by inotropic agents may explain their different effect in patients with heart failure , further study is necessary to reach this conclusion . We have shown that amlodipine increases the survival of mice with viral myocarditis and inhibits expression of inducible NO synthase and production of NO in vivo and in vitro . The therapeutic effect of amlodipine may in part result from inhibition of overproduction of NO . As we learn more about the pathophysiological and pathogenetic role of cytokines in heart failure , it should be possible to design better and more targeted pharmacological agents . Furthermore , the investigation of inotropic agents that are effective against the production of cytokines may help in the classification of these agents .
