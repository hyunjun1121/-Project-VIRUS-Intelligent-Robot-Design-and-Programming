To cell cycle , swing the P25054 /C . For successful mitosis , P12004 B1 and O95997 must be degraded efficiently before anaphase . Destruction of these mitotic regulators by the 26S proteasome is the result of their poly-ubiquitination by a multi-subunit E3 ligase : the Anaphase-Promoting Complex or Cyclosome ( P25054 /C ) . Clearly , the P25054 /C is not just important for mitosis . Destruction of P25054 /C substrates such as Cdc20 , Plk1 , Aurora A and Skp2 directs events in P55008 . Strikingly , the P25054 /C needs to stay active even in quiescent cells to keep them out of the cell cycle and forms an intriguing link with P06400 . An inactive P25054 /C stabilizes O75496 , P12004 A and P12004 B1 , thereby securing completion of DNA synthesis and progression through G2-phase . In prometaphase the P25054 /C becomes active again , but is controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint . Here we discuss how the P25054 /C is either held in check or released . We argue that shedding more light on the P25054 /C is also important to understand cancer and could help the design of treatment .
