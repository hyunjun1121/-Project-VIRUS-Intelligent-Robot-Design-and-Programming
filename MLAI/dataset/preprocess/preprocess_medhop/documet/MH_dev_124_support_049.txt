P08571 receptor polymorphism and Alzheimer 's disease risk . Activation of microglial cells is involved in the inflammatory component of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , and it may be triggered by infectious pathogens . P08571 , a receptor upregulated in activated microglia , plays a central role in innate immunity through recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and initiation of inflammatory response . A polymorphism in the promoter region ( -260 ) of the P08571 receptor has been found to be related to increased risk of bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis . In a case-control study utilizing a clinically well-defined group of 310 sporadic AD patients and 310 control subjects , we investigated whether the P08571 ( -260 ) polymorphism might be responsible for susceptibility to AD , and we also examined the combined gene effects between P08571 and P02649 and several other proinflammatory cytokine genes . The current study does not demonstrate an association between P08571 ( -260 ) polymorphism and AD , neither through an independent effect nor through interaction with P02649 epsilon4 allele or interleukin ( IL ) -1A , P05231 , P10145 , tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 polymorphisms .
