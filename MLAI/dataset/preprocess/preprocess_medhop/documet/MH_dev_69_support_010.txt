Possible association of beta-arrestin 2 gene with methamphetamine use disorder , but not schizophrenia . Recent investigations suggest that the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) signaling cascade may be associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and methamphetamine ( METH ) use disorder . One important molecule related to this cascade is beta-arrestin 2 ( P32121 ) . We therefore conducted a genetic case-control association analysis of the gene for P32121 with schizophrenia and METH use disorder in a Japanese population ( 547 people with schizophrenia , 177 with METH use disorder and 546 controls ) . A possible association of ' tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ' was found in METH use disorder ( rs1045280 : P(genotype) = 0.0118 , P(allele) = 0.00351 ; rs2036657 : P(allele) = 0.0431 ; rs4790694 : P(genotype) = 0.0167 , P(allele) = 0.0202 ) , but no association was found with schizophrenia . We also evaluated the gene-gene interactions among P32121 , P31749 , and P49841 , which we previously reported for each of these diseases . However , no interaction was seen in our samples . This is the first association analysis of P32121 , and our results indicate that P32121 may play a role in the pathophysiology of METH use disorder .
