CNS-specific prostacyclin ligands as neuronal survival-promoting factors in the brain . DB01240 ( DB01240 ) is a critical regulator of the cardiovascular system , via dilatation of vascular smooth muscle and inhibition of platelet aggregation ( Moncada , S. 1982 , Br. J. Pharmacol. , 76 , 3 ) . Our previous studies demonstrated that a novel subtype of P43119 , which is clearly distinct from a peripheral subtype in terms of ligand specificity , is expressed in the rostral region of the brain , e.g. cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus and striatum , and that ( 15R ) -16-m-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin ( 15R- Q8NDX1 ) and 15-deoxy-16-m-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin ( 15-deoxy- Q8NDX1 ) specifically bind to the central nervous system ( CNS ) -specific P43119 . Here , we report that these CNS-specific P43119 ligands , including DB01240 itself , prevented the neuronal death . They prevented apoptotic cell death of hippocampal neurons induced by high ( 50 % ) oxygen atmosphere , xanthine + xanthine oxidase , and serum deprivation . IC50s for neuronal death were approximately 30 and 300 nM for 15-deoxy- Q8NDX1 and 15R- Q8NDX1 , respectively , which well correlated with the binding potency for the CNS-specific P43119 . 6-Keto-PGF1alpha ( a stable metabolite of DB01240 ) , peripheral nervous system-specific DB01240 ligands and other prostaglandins ( PGs ) than DB01240 did not show such neuroprotective effects . In vivo , 15R- Q8NDX1 protected P00915 pyramidal neurons against ischaemic damage in gerbils . These results indicate that CNS-specific DB01240 ligands have neuronal survival-promoting activity both in vitro and in vivo , and may represent a new type of therapeutic drug for neurodegeneration .
