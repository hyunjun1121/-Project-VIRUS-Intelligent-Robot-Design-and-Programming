Thrombin and activated protein C inhibit the expression of secretory group IIA phospholipase A(2) in the P01375 -activated endothelial cells by Q9UNN8 and P25116 dependent mechanisms . INTRODUCTION : Thrombin and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha up-regulate the expression of proinflammatory molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . However , activated protein C ( P25054 ) down-regulates the expression of the same molecules . The expression level of secretory group IIA phospholipase A(2) ( sPLA(2)-IIA ) is known to be elevated in inflammatory disorders including in sepsis . Here , we investigated the effects of P25054 and thrombin on the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in HUVECs . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The expression level of sPLA(2)-IIA was quantitatively measured by an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay following stimulation of HUVECs with either thrombin or P01375 in the absence and presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -kinase ) inhibitor LY294002 and the cholesterol-depleting drug methyl-beta-cyclodextrin ( MbetaCD ) . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Thrombin had no effect on the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in HUVECs , however , P01375 potently induced its expression . The prior treatment of cells with P25054 inhibited expression of sPLA(2)-IIA through the Q9UNN8 -dependent cleavage of P25116 . Further studies revealed that if HUVECs were pretreated with the zymogen protein C to occupy Q9UNN8 , thrombin also inhibited the P01375 -mediated expression of sPLA(2)-IIA through the cleavage of P25116 . The Q9UNN8 -dependent cleavage of P25116 by both P25054 and thrombin increased the phosphorylation of P29323 1/2 . Pretreatment of cells with either LY294002 or MbetaCD abolished the inhibitory activity of both P25054 and thrombin against sPLA(2)-IIA expression , suggesting that the protein C occupancy of Q9UNN8 confers a P19957 -kinase dependent protective activity for thrombin such that its cleavage of the lipid-raft localized P25116 inhibits the P01375 -mediated expression of sPLA(2)-IIA in HUVECs .
