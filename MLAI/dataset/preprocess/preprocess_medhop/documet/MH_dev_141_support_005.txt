DB09030 expands antiplatelet options . Which patients may benefit from thrombin receptor antagonism ? DB09030 is the first substance of a new class of antiplatelet drugs that has been tested in large clinical trials . The protease-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) antagonist inhibits thrombin-induced platelet activation to prevent atherothrombosis . In the phase 3 trials TRACER ( acute coronary syndrome ) and TRA 2P-TIMI 50 ( stable atherosclerosis ) reducing ischemic events with vorapaxar came at the cost of bleeding . TRACER compared vorapaxar to placebo in 12,944 patients who had non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes on top of contemporary treatment including dual antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin and clopidogrel ) . DB09030 reduced ischemic events non-significantly , but increased bleeding significantly , therefore not justifying triple antiplatelet therapy in this setting . Follow-up was stopped early because of bleeding . TRA 2P-TIMI 50 examined 26,449 patients who had a history of myocardial infarction , ischemic stroke , or peripheral arterial disease . DB09030 reduced ischemic events and increased bleeding both significantly . Recruitment of patients with prior stroke was stopped early . Net clinical outcome and subgroup analyses suggested that vorapaxar could be beneficial for patients with prior myocardial infarction - but no history of stroke .
