An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , eserine , induces long-term depression at P07451 - P00915 synapses in the hippocampus of adult rats . Studies in humans and rodents support a role for muscarinic ACh receptor ( mAChR ) and nicotinic AChR in learning and memory , and both regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity using complex and often times opposing mechanisms . P22303 ( P22303 ) inhibitors are commonly prescribed to enhance cholinergic signaling in Alzheimer 's disease in hopes of rescuing cognitive function , caused , in part , by degeneration of cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus and cortex . Unfortunately , therapeutic efficacy is moderate and inconsistent , perhaps due to unanticipated mechanisms . M1 mAChRs bidirectionally control synaptic strength at P07451 - P00915 synapses ; weak pharmacological activation using carbachol ( CCh ) facilitates potentiation , whereas strong agonism induces muscarinic long-term depression ( mLTD ) via an P29323 -dependent mechanism . Here , we tested the prediction that accumulation of extracellular ACh via inhibition of P22303 is sufficient to induce LTD at P07451 - P00915 synapses in hippocampal slices from adult rats . Although P22303 inhibition with eserine induces LTD , it unexpectedly does not share properties with mLTD induced by CCh , as reported previously . DB00981 -LTD was prevented by the M3 mAChR-preferring antagonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide ( 4-DAMP ) , and pharmacological inhibition of MEK was completely ineffective . Additionally , pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK prevents mLTD but has no effect on eserine-LTD . Finally , long-term expression of eserine-LTD is partially dependent on a decrease in presynaptic release probability , likely caused by tonic activation of mAChRs by the sustained increase in extracellular ACh . Thus these findings extend current literature by showing that pharmacological P22303 inhibition causes a prolonged decrease in presynaptic glutamate release at P07451 - P00915 synapses , in addition to inducing a likely postsynaptic form of LTD .
