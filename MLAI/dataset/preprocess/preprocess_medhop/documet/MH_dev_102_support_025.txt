Multiple antigenic polypeptide composed of heparanase B‑cell epitopes shrinks human hepatocellular carcinoma in mice . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti‑growth effect of the self‑designed multiple antigenic polypeptide ( Q96HU1 ) vaccine comprising B‑cell epitopes of heparanase ( Q9Y251 ) on HCC97‑H hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) in mice . The polyclonal antibodies against the B‑cell epitopes of Q9Y251 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with freshly synthesized Q96HU1 vaccine . HCC‑bearing models were constructed on BALB/c nude mice . Anti‑ Q96HU1 antibodies were administrered to the models to assess the effects on Q9Y251 activity , HCC growth , the expression of P15692 / P09038 and the value of micro‑vessel density ( P53602 ) . The anti‑ Q96HU1 antibodies were harvested , purified and identified . These antibodies were able to specifically bind with the dominant epitopes of the precursor protein and large subunit monomer of Q9Y251 , decrease Q9Y251 activity , suppress the expressions of P15692 and P09038 , reduce the P53602 , and markedly shrink the HCC volume . Based on these findings , Q96HU1 vaccine based on the B‑cell epitopes of Q9Y251 seemed to provide theoretical evidence for further study of the synthesized Q9Y251 Q96HU1 vaccine in the treatment of HCC .
