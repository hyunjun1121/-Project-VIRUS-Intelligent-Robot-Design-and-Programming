Linkage of cytokine genes to rheumatoid arthritis . Evidence of genetic heterogeneity . OBJECTIVE : To investigate linkage of candidate disease susceptibility genes to rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in affected sibling pair families stratified for specific clinical features . METHOD : Two hundred RA affected sibling pair families were genotyped for informative microsatellite markers mapping within or less than 3cM from : P27352 alpha , P27352 gamma , P27352 beta , IL1 alpha , IL1 beta , P14778 , P60568 , P05231 , Q01344 , IL8R , P10415 , P29965 , NOS3 , P49279 , alpha 1 anti-trypsin , and alpha 1 anti-chymotrypsin , using fluorescence based automated technology . Linkage was examined by defining allele sharing sibling pairs . This was assessed by maximum likelihood-inheritance by descent methods . RESULTS : An increase in allele sharing was seen for Q01344 in female sibling pairs ( LOD 0.91 , p = 0.03 ) , for P27352 gamma in sibling pairs with an affected male ( LOD 0.96 , p = 0.03 ) and most significantly for P60568 in sibling pairs where one or both were persistently seronegative ( LOD 1.05 , p = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSION : Weak evidence of linkage of RA to Q01344 , IFN gamma , and P60568 has been detected in clinical subsets of sibling pairs suggesting that RA is a genetically heterogeneous disease .
