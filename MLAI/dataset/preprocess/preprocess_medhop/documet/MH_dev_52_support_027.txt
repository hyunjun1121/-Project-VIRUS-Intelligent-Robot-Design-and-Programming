Cost-effectiveness of P22309 genotyping in second-line , high-dose , once every 3 weeks irinotecan monotherapy treatment of colorectal cancer . AIM : The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of P22309 genotyping in second-line , high-dose , once every 3 weeks irinotecan monotherapy treatment of colorectal cancer . METHODS : Standard therapy was compared with alternative strategies based on P22309 genotyping from the US healthcare payer perspective . Two alternative strategies ( dose reduction and prophylactic use of G- P04141 with prior genotyping ) and standard therapy were evaluated in a decision analysis , whereas alternative regimens were considered in discussion . The effectiveness outcome was severe neutropenia occurrence and number of life-years gained . RESULTS & CONCLUSION : Genotyping in combination with a subsequent reduction of initial irinotecan dose for P22309 7/7 genotype patients was cost-saving for the population of African and Caucasian origin . By contrast , P22309 genotyping was not cost effective for the population of Asian ancestry . Furthermore , the prophylactic use of G-CSFs in P22309 7/7 genotype patients was not cost effective in any population group . Finally , the application of a 3-weekly high-dose treatment regimen with a 20 % reduced dosage compared with the low-dose weekly irinotecan regimen in patients with P22309 7/7 genotype was less expensive and is more convenient for the patient .
