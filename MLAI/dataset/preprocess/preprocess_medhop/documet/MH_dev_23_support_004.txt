TG-interacting factor transcriptionally induced by AKT/ O43524 is a negative regulator that antagonizes arsenic trioxide-induced cancer cell apoptosis . DB01169 ( ATO ) is a multi-target drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration as the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia . In addition , several clinical trials are being conducted with arsenic-based drugs for the treatment of other hematological malignancies and solid tumors . However , ATO 's modest clinical efficacy on some cancers , and potential toxic effects on humans have been reported . Determining how best to reduce these adverse effects while increasing its therapeutic efficacy is obviously a critical issue . Previously , we demonstrated that the JNK-induced complex formation of phosphorylated c-Jun and TG-interacting factor ( Q15583 ) antagonizes P29323 -induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P38936 ( P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) ) expression and resultant apoptosis in response to ATO in A431 cells . Surprisingly , at low-concentrations ( 0.1-0.2 μM ) , ATO increased cellular proliferation , migration and invasion , involving Q15583 expression , however , at high-concentrations ( 5-20 μM ) , ATO induced cell apoptosis . Using a promoter analysis , Q15583 was transcriptionally regulated by ATO at the O43524 binding site ( -1486 to -1479bp ) via the c-Src/ P00533 /AKT pathway . Stable overexpression of Q15583 promoted advancing the cell cycle into the S phase , and attenuated 20 μM ATO-induced apoptosis . Furthermore , blockage of the AKT pathway enhanced ATO-induced P38936 expression and resultant apoptosis in cancer cells , but overexpression of P31749 inhibited P38936 expression . Therefore , we suggest that Q15583 is transcriptionally regulated by the c-Src/ P00533 /AKT pathway , which plays a role as a negative regulator in antagonizing ATO-induced P38936 expression and resultant apoptosis . Suppression of these antagonistic effects might be a promising therapeutic strategy toward improving clinical efficacy of ATO .
