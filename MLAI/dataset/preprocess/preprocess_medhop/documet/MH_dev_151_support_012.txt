DB01016 exerts an antitumor activity through reactive oxygen species-c-jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway in human gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 . DB01016 , a blocker of DB00171 -sensitive potassium ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels , can suppress progression of many cancers , but the involved mechanism is unclear . Herein we reported that MGC-803 cells expressed the K( DB00171 ) channels composed of Kir6.2 and Q09428 subunits . DB01016 induced cellular viability decline , coupled with cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation in MGC-803 cells . Meanwhile , glibenclamide increased NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91(phox) expression and superoxide anion ( O2- ) generation , and caused mitochondrial respiration dysfunction in MGC-803 cells , suggesting that glibenclamide induced an increase of ROS derived from NADPH oxidase and mitochondria . DB01016 could also lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor ( O95831 ) , and activation of c-jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in MGC-803 cells . Pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine ( Q9C000 ) prevented glibenclamide-induced JNK activation , apoptosis and cellular viability decline . Furthermore , glibenclamide greatly decreased the cellular viability , induced apoptosis and inhibited Akt activation in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells but not in P45983 -/- or P45984 -/- MEF cells . Taken together , our study reveals that glibenclamide exerts an antitumor activity in MGC-803 cells by activating ROS-dependent , JNK-driven cell apoptosis . These findings provide insights into the use of glibenclamide in the treatment of human gastric cancer .
