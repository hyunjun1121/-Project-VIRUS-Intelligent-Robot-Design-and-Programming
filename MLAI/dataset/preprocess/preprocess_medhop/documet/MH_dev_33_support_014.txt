Proteome-wide changes induced by the Hsp90 inhibitor , geldanamycin in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells . The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) affects the function of many oncogenic signaling proteins including nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( P06748 - Q9UM73 ) expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . While Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells are sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor and the geldanamycin ( GA ) analog , 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17- P29372 ) , the proteomic effects of these drugs on Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells are unpublished . In this study , we investigated the cellular , biologic , and proteomic changes occurring in Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells in response to GA treatment . GA induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis . Furthermore , quantitative proteomic changes analyzed by cleavable isotope-coded affinity tag-LC-MS/MS ( cICAT-LC-MS/MS ) identified 176 differentially expressed proteins . Out of these , 49 were upregulated 1.5-fold or greater and 70 were downregulated 1.5-fold or greater in GA-treated cells . Analysis of biological functions of differentially expressed proteins revealed diverse changes , including induction of proteins involved in the 26S proteasome as well as downregulation of proteins involved in signal transduction and protein and nucleic acid metabolism . Pathway analysis revealed changes in MAPK , WNT , NF-kappaB , TGFbeta , Q07869 , and integrin signaling components . Our studies reveal some of the molecular and proteomic consequences of Hsp90 inhibition in Q9UM73 -positive ALCL cells and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of its diverse cellular effects .
