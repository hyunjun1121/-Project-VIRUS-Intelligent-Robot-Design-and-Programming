Alpha-tocopherol as a modulator of smooth muscle cell proliferation . The effects of DB00163 and beta-tocopherol have been studied in rat and human aortic smooth muscle cells . Alpha-tocopherol , but not beta-tocopherol , inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation and protein kinase C in a dose-dependent manner , at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 microM . Beta-tocopherol added simultaneously with DB00163 prevented both proliferation and protein kinase C inhibition . Protein kinase C inhibition was cell cycle-dependent and it was prevented by okadaic acid , a protein phosphatase inhibitor . Protein kinase C activity measured from aortas of cholesterol-fed rabbits was also inhibited by DB00163 . By using protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoform-specific inhibitors and immunoprecipitation reactions it was found that P17252 was selectively inhibited by DB00163 . Further , an activation of protein phosphatase 2A by DB00163 was found , which caused P17252 dephosphorylation and inhibition . Ultimately , this cascade of events at the level of cell signal transduction leads to the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation .
