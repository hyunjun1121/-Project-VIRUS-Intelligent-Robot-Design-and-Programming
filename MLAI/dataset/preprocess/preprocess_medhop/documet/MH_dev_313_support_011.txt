Role of nitrative and oxidative DNA damage in inflammation-related carcinogenesis . Chronic inflammation induced by biological , chemical , and physical factors has been found to be associated with the increased risk of cancer in various organs . We revealed that infectious agents including liver fluke , Helicobacter pylori , and human papilloma virus and noninfectious agents such as asbestos fiber induced P35228 -dependent formation of 8-nitroguanine and 8-oxo-7 , 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) in cancer tissues and precancerous regions . Our results with the colocalization of phosphorylated Q13315 and Î³- P16104 with 8-oxodG and 8-nitroguanine in inflammation-related cancer tissues suggest that DNA base damage leads to double-stranded breaks . It is interesting from the aspect of genetic instability . We also demonstrated P05231 -modulated P35228 expression via P40763 and P00533 in Epstein-Barr-virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma and found promoter hypermethylation in several tumor suppressor genes . Such epigenetic alteration may occur by controlling the DNA methylation through P05231 -mediated JAK/ P40763 pathways . Collectively , 8-nitroguanine would be a useful biomarker for predicting the risk of inflammation-related cancers .
