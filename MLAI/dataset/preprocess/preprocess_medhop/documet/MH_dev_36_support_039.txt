Genetics of bipolar disorder . Many linkage loci and candidate genes have been reported in molecular genetic studies of bipolar disorder . However , none of these findings have been consistently replicated . Meta-analyses of linkage studies have also reported conflicting results . Among recently reported candidate genes , P23560 , P59103 , P31749 , Q12879 , P17861 , P35626 , Q13639 , O14732 and P14867 may have some importance . Study of the possible roles of epigenetics or analysis of genetic diseases , in which bipolar disorder is one of phenotypes , may also be promising . In addition to monoaminergic and intracellular signaling pathways , recent studies have revealed possible roles for mitochondrial dysfunction , for glutamatergic dysfunction and for the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway .
