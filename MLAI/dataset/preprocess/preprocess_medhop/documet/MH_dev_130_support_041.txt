Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha response in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increase in serum soluble P28908 . OBJECTIVE : Patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) display high serum concentrations of soluble P28908 ( sCD30 ) , which correlate with counter-regulatory activity of P28908 + T cells in the inflamed joint . To verify the contribution of this T cell subset to disease remission , sCD30 levels were analyzed longitudinally in patients with active RA following infliximab therapy . METHODS : DB00065 plus methotrexate were started in 39 patients with active RA , while 20 patients with inactive disease , controlled by stable doses of methotrexate , acted as controls . Serial evaluations of sCD30 concentrations and disease activity indexes were performed throughout 38 weeks . RESULTS : sCD30 levels were higher in patients than in healthy controls . Rapid infliximab-induced decrease in disease activity was associated with an overall increase of sCD30 levels . In contrast , levels remained stable in controls . An inverse correlation between sCD30 levels and Disease Activity Score 28 was observed from the 22nd week of infliximab treatment . Analysis of sCD30 levels according to American College of Rheumatology response showed , after an initial general enhancement of sCD30 concentrations , a persistent increase of sCD30 in responders , but not in nonresponders . CONCLUSION : sCD30 serum levels are enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-a ( P01375 ) blockade in patients with active RA and inversely correlated with disease activity , but only after some weeks of treatment . Of interest , a sustained increase of sCD30 is present only in subjects with evidence of persistent clinical response to anti- P01375 . As sCD30 serum levels mirror antiinflammatory activity of joint T cells , the present data may suggest a role of synovial counter-regulatory P28908 + T cells in the induction of infliximab-mediated remission in RA .
