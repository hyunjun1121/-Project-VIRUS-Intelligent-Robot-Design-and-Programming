Characterization of the effect of chronic administration of a calcium-sensing receptor antagonist , DB05255 , on renal calcium excretion and serum calcium in postmenopausal women . Ronacaleret is an orally-active calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) antagonist that has the potential for therapeutic utility in the stimulation of PTH release , notably as a bone anabolic agent comparable to recombinant human PTH(1-34) ( DB05829 (1-34) ) . A recent study has shown that , despite the ability to increase circulating PTH levels in postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner , minimal effects of DB05255 on bone mineral density have been observed . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to characterize the PTH profile as well as calcium metabolism parameters as a marker of PTH biological activity following the administration of DB05255 or DB05829 (1-34) . Administration of DB05255 led to lower peak levels of PTH than were observed with DB05829 (1-34) , however , greater total PTH exposure was observed . Further , chronic administration of either agent was associated with increases in urinary calcium excretion and serum calcium levels , with the magnitude of the changes following DB05255 significantly greater than that for DB05829 (1-34) . The greater magnitude of effects observed with DB05255 is likely due to the greater total PTH exposure , and is potentially reflective of a state comparable to mild hyperparathyroidism . It is not clear whether the administration of all calcilytics would lead to a similar result , or is due to characteristics specific to DB05255 .
