Ca2+ or Sr2+ partially rescues synaptic transmission in hippocampal cultures treated with botulinum toxin A and C , but not tetanus toxin . Botulinum ( DB00083 -G ) and tetanus toxins ( TeNT ) are zinc endopeptidases that cleave proteins associated with presynaptic terminals ( P60880 , syntaxin , or VAMP/synaptobrevin ) and block neurotransmitter release . Treatment of hippocampal slice cultures with DB00083 , BoNT/C , BoNT/E , or TeNT prevented the occurrence of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs ( sEPSCs or mEPSCs ) as well as the [Ca2+]o-independent increase in their frequency induced by phorbol ester , 0.5 nM alpha-latrotoxin , or sucrose . [Ca2+]o-independent and -dependent release thus requires that the target proteins of clostridial neurotoxins be uncleaved . In contrast , significant increases in mEPSC frequency were produced in BoNT-treated , but not TeNT-treated , cultures by application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in the presence of 10 mM [Ca2+]o . The frequency of sEPSCs was increased in BoNT-treated , but not TeNT-treated , cultures by increasing [Ca2+]o from 2.8 to 5-10 mM or by applying 5 mM Sr2+ . Large Ca2+ and Sr2+ influxes thus can rescue release after BoNT treatment , albeit less than in control cultures . The nature of the toxin-induced modification of Ca2+-dependent release was assessed by recordings from monosynaptically coupled P07451 cell pairs . The paired-pulse ratio of unitary EPSCs evoked by two presynaptic action potentials in close succession was 0.5 in control cultures , but it was 1.4 and 1.2 in DB00083 - or BoNT/C-treated cultures when recorded in 10 mM [Ca2+]o . Log-log plots of unitary EPSC amplitude versus [Ca2+]o were shifted toward higher [Ca2+]o in DB00083 - or BoNT/C-treated cultures , but their slope was unchanged and the maximal EPSC amplitudes were reduced . We conclude that BoNTs reduce the Ca2+ sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery and the number of quanta released .
