DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia : discovery , design and first therapeutic experiences . INTRODUCTION : DNA methylation is an epigenetic change mediated by DNA methyltranferases ( DNMTs ) , which are promising epigenetic targets for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . This is evidenced by the two P26358 inhibitors ( azacitidine and decitabine ) approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and the first clinical data available in AML . AREAS COVERED : This paper reviews data from the international literature regarding the design , sites of impact and pharmacodynamic characteristics of P26358 inhibitors , and their first clinical experiences in AML . EXPERT OPINION : The strongest advances in epigenetic therapy have been in the treatment of AML . There are now an increasing number of P26358 inhibitors . These agents may be potentially administered at different times of leukemia therapy : before or instead of chemotherapy , as maintenance therapy , prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant ( P09683 ) or after relapse following P09683 .
