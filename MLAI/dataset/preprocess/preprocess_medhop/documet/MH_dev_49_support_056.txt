That which does not kill me makes me stronger ; combining P27361 /2 pathway inhibitors and BH3 mimetics to kill tumour cells and prevent acquired resistance . Oncogenic mutations in DB01367 or P15056 can drive the inappropriate activation of the P27361 /2 . In many cases , tumour cells adapt to become addicted to this deregulated P27361 /2 signalling for their proliferation , providing a therapeutic window for tumour-selective growth inhibition . As a result , inhibition of P27361 /2 signalling by P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy . Indeed , the first P15056 inhibitor , vemurafenib , has now been approved for clinical use , while clinical evaluation of Q02750 /2 inhibitors is at an advanced stage . Despite this progress , it is apparent that tumour cells adapt quickly to these new targeted agents so that tumours with acquired resistance can emerge within 6-9 months of primary treatment . One of the major reasons for this is that tumour cells typically respond to P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors by undergoing a P55008 cell cycle arrest rather than dying . Indeed , although inhibition of P27361 /2 invariably increases the expression of pro-apoptotic P10415 family proteins , tumour cells undergo minimal apoptosis . This cytostatic response may simply provide the cell with the opportunity to adapt and acquire resistance . Here we discuss recent studies that demonstrate that combination of P15056 or Q02750 /2 inhibitors with inhibitors of pro-survival P10415 proteins is synthetic lethal for P27361 /2-addicted tumour cells . This combination effectively transforms the cytostatic response of P15056 and Q02750 /2 inhibitors into a striking apoptotic cell death response . This not only augments the primary efficacy of P15056 and Q02750 /2 inhibitors but delays the onset of acquired resistance to these agents , validating their combination in the clinic .
