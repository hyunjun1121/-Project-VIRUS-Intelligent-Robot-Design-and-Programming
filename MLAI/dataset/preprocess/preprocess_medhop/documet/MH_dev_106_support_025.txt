Release of cytokines by blood monocytes during strenuous exercise . During strenuous exercise in endurance athletes , monocytes are activated and there is an acute inflammation and hypoxemia possibly due to lesional pulmonary edema . P05231 and P01375 released by monocytes may be implicated in the acute phase of lesional pulmonary edema . A study was carried out to determine whether P01375 and P05231 are released during strenuous exercise , and , if adrenalin released during exercise alters their generation . Ten young and six master athletes underwent an incremental exercise test . Arterial blood was drawn at rest , at the end of the exercise , and 20 minutes afterwards . Monocytes were isolated and incubated for 18 hours in the presence or absence of adrenalin . Il-6 and P01375 were measured in monocyte supernatants . The spontaneous release of P05231 or P01375 was increased in young athletes when compared to older subjects . The spontaneous release of P01375 was increased , but not significantly , by exercise and there was no correlation between the release of P05231 and P01375 and lung function measured during hypoxemia . DB00668 inhibited the release of P05231 or P01375 . Correlations were observed between the in vitro release of P05231 or P01375 and age , VO2max , maximal ventilation and maximal power output of the subjects .
