DB09559 in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer : translation from preclinical to clinical development . INTRODUCTION : Treatment outcomes in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC remain disappointing with platinum-based chemotherapy . The addition of monoclonal antibodies targeting P00533 to standard first-line therapy is a validated strategy and has been associated with statistically significant survival advantage in advanced NSCLC . Necitumunab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting P00533 , having the potential benefit of lower hypersensitivity reaction risk as compared with cetuximab and also equivalent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity . AREAS COVERED : This paper reviews literature on preclinical and early clinical development of necitumumab that is available in PubMed and published abstracts from conferences , as well as ongoing trials as specified by clinicaltrials.gov . Recently , the Phase III clinical trial evaluating the addition of necitumumab to pemetrexed and cisplatin in non-squamous NSCLC was prematurely closed due to concerns about the increased risk of thromboembolic events in the experimental arm . Accrual in the Phase III trial of necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in squamous NSCLC is ongoing . EXPERT OPINION : Results of the ongoing large randomized trials will be instrumental in determining the drug 's clinical significance and , with the analysis of potential molecular predictive factors , are expected to bring valuable additions to future therapeutic strategies in NSCLC .
