A novel multiple tyrosine-kinase targeted agent to explore the future perspectives of anti-angiogenic therapy for the treatment of multiple solid tumors : cabozantinib . The process of angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature by the over expression of certain factors leading to the growth and development of all solid tumor types . P08581 abbreviated as c- DB00134 and vascular endothelial growth factor abbreviated as P15692 are some of the factors responsible for the induction in tumor growth and development . Recently a number of analogues associated with these receptors are under study . US FDA on November 29 , 2012 approved a drug named cabozantinib formerly known as DB05153 which is being marketed under the trade name of Cometriq for the treatment of Medullary Thyroid Cancer ( P04629 ) . Designing of the drug has been done in such a fashion that it can inhibit both P35968 and c- DB00134 simultaneously without over expressing any of the factors leading to the inhibition of angiogenesis . The drug is still under study for the evaluation of its efficacy in cases of many other solid tumor types including breast cancer , castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer , melanoma , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma . This review article consists of preclinical and clinical data of cabozantinib and its efficacy and safety towards various types of solid tumors .
