New paradigms in gastrointestinal stromal tumour management . BACKGROUND : Targeted agents have improved the prognosis for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( GISTs ) . Many patients exhibit intolerance or resistance to first-line therapy with imatinib mesylate . DB01268 malate is approved multinationally for the treatment of advanced imatinib-refractory GIST . DESIGN : This article reviews responses to imatinib and sunitinib reported in clinical trials in advanced GIST and discusses the effect of mutational status on treatment responses ; therapeutic developments in GIST treatment are also reviewed . RESULTS : Imatinib 400 mg/day has shown efficacy for first-line treatment of advanced GIST , particularly in patients with P10721 exon 11 mutations . DB01268 50 mg/day ( Schedule 4/2 ) has demonstrated effectiveness and tolerability in imatinib-refractory GIST , including patients who would be excluded from clinical trials . DB01268 is associated with longer median overall survival in patients with primary P10721 exon 9 mutations and wild-type GIST compared with P10721 exon 11 mutations in a retrospective study . Ongoing studies , including imatinib in the adjuvant setting and the use of targeted agents in sequence or in combination , will further refine the therapeutic pathway for advanced GIST . CONCLUSIONS : The availability of targeted therapies and greater knowledge of the effect of mutational status on patient responses will assist in optimising outcomes in advanced GIST .
