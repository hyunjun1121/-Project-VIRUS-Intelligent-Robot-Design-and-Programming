Marker gene polymorphisms in hyperkinetic disorder -- predictors of clinical response to treatment with methylphenidate ? Gene polymorphisms of the dopamine D4 receptor ( P21917 ) and serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) are under discussion as potential genetic risk factors for hyperkinetic disorder ( HD ) . In this disorder , treatment with the psychostimulant methylphenidate ( DB00422 ; Ritalin ) induces calming effects and amelioration in only 70 % of the patients . DB00422 blocks the reuptake of dopamine , thus enhancing synaptic dopamine which in turn antagonizes the release of prolactin ( PL ) . Genotyping HD patients for P21917 and 5-HTT polymorphisms and measuring PL concentrations , we report on an association between the combination P21917 *7/ P31645 LL genotype and a reduced improvement in general functioning accompanied by different PL levels upon DB00422 treatment . Thus , our study supports the hypothesis that marker gene polymorphism may be helpful in identifying DB00422 non-responders .
