Integrated STS/YAC physical , genetic , and transcript map of human Xq21.3 to q23/q24 ( DXS1203-DXS1059 ) . A map has been assembled that extends from the XY homology region in Xq21.3 to proximal Xq24 , approximately 20 Mb , formatted with 200 STSs that include 25 dinucleotide repeat polymorphic markers and more than 80 expressed sequences including 30 genes . New genes HTRP5 , Q9Y6Q1 , STPK , 14-3-3PKR , and P62158 and previously known genes including Q06187 , O60220 , GLA , PLP , P29400 , Q14031 , O75914 , and O43602 are localized ; candidate loci for other disorders for which genes have not yet been identified , including DFN-2 , POF , megalocornea , and syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation , are also mapped in the region . The telomeric end of the contig overlaps a yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) contig from Xq24-q26 and with other previously published contigs provides complete sequence-tagged site ( STS ) /YAC-based coverage of the long arm of the X chromosome . The order of published landmark loci in genetic and radiation hybrid maps is in general agreement . Combined with high-density STS landmarks , the multiple YAC clone coverage and integrated genetic , radiation hybrid , and transcript map provide resources to further disease gene searches and sequencing .
