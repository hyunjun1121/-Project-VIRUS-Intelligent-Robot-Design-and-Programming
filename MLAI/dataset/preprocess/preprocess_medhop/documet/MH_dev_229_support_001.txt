P04035 inhibitor cerivastatin inhibits interleukin-6 expression and secretion in human adipocytes . Human adipose tissue is a main contributor to plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine P05231 . How P05231 expression is regulated in adipocytes remains unclear . In the current study , we investigated the effect of the P04035 inhibitor , cerivastatin , on the production of P05231 from cultured human adipocytes . DB00439 reduced both P05231 mRNA and secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The inhibitory effect on P05231 mRNA was prevented by the intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway , mevalonate and geranyl-geranyl-phyrophosphate ( GGPP ) but not by farnesyl-pyrophosphate . This suggests the involvement of geranylgeranyl-modified intermediates in the effect of cerivastatin on P05231 . Moreover , cerivastatin induced an inactivation of the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NFkappaB which was prevented by GGPP . Our data suggest that cerivastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating P05231 levels in adipocytes , which seems to be mediated by reduced production of GGPP and interference with the NFkappaB pathway .
