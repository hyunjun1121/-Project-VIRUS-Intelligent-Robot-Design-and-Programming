Antiemetic and motor-depressive actions of CP55,940 : cannabinoid P21554 receptor characterization , distribution , and G-protein activation . Dibenzopyran ( Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ) and aminoalkylindole [ R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrolol[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl) methanone mesylate ; ( WIN55,212-2 ) ] cannabinoids suppress vomiting produced by cisplatin via cannabinoid CB(1) receptors . This study investigates the antiemetic potential of the " nonclassical " cannabinoid CP55,940 [ 1alpha,2beta-(R)-5alpha ] -(-)-5-(1,1-dimethyl)-2- [ 5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexyl-phenol ] against cisplatin-induced vomiting and assesses the presence and functionality of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors in the least shrew ( Cryptotis parva ) brain . CP55,940 ( 0.025-0.3 mg/kg ) reduced both the frequency of cisplatin-induced emesis ( ID(50)=0.025 mg/kg ) and the percentage of shrews vomiting ( ID(50)=0.09 mg/kg ) . CP55,940 also suppressed shrew motor behaviors ( ID(50)=0.06- 0.21 mg/kg ) at such doses . The antiemetic and motor-suppressant actions of CP55,940 were countered by SR141716A [ N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)- DB01213 -3-carboxamide ] , indicating both effects are cannabinoid CB(1) receptor-mediated . Autoradiographic studies with [ 3H ] -SR141716A and [ 35S ] -GTPgammaS binding revealed that the distribution of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor and its activation pattern are similar to rodent brain and significant levels are present in brain loci ( e.g. , nucleus tractus solitarius ( P30990 ) ) that control emesis . The affinity rank order of structurally diverse cannabinoid ligands for cannabinoid CB(1) receptor in shrew brain is similar to rodent brain : HU-210=CP55,940=SR141716A >/= WIN55,212-2 >/= DB00470 > methanandamide=HU-211=cannabidiol=2-arachidonoylglycerol . This affinity order is also similar and is highly correlated to the cannabinoid EC(50) potency rank order for GTPgammaS stimulation except WIN55,212-2 and DB00470 potency order were reversed . The affinity and the potency rank order of tested cannabinoids were significantly correlated with their antiemetic ID(50) potency order against cisplatin-induced vomiting ( CP55,940 > WIN55,212-2= DB00470 ) as well as emesis produced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol or SR141716A ( CP55,940 > WIN55,212-2 > DB00470 ) .
