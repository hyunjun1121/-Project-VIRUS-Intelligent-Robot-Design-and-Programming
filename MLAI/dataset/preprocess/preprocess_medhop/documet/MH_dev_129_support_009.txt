A new algorithm for weekly phenprocoumon dose variation in a southern Brazilian population : role for P11712 , P08684 /5 and Q9BQB6 genes polymorphisms . DB00946 is widely used in prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders . However , its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary according to several genetic and non-genetic factors . DB00946 metabolism is mediated by P11712 and CYP3A enzymes . Moreover , Q9BQB6 is phenprocoumon target of action . Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in Q9BQB6 , P11712 , P08684 and P20815 genes with the variance of weekly phenprocoumon dose as well as to develop an algorithm for dose prediction based on genetic and environmental factors . A total of 198 patients with stable phenprocoumon dose , 81 % of European ancestry , were investigated . Genotypes were determined by allelic discrimination with TaqMan assays . Polymorphisms -1639G > A and 1173C > T in Q9BQB6 and the presence of P11712 *2 and/or P11712 *3 are associated with lower doses . On the other hand , 3730G > A in Q9BQB6 gene is associated with higher doses . No association was found between P08684 *1B , P20815 *3 and P20815 *6 polymorphisms . Among non-genetic factors , gender , height , age and use of captopril , omeprazole , simvastatin and Î²-blockers are associated with dose . Two algorithms were derived : one for the whole sample explained 42 % of dose variation and one for patients of European ancestry only which explained 46 % of phenprocoumon dose . The mean absolute difference between observed and predicted dose was low in both models ( 3.92 mg/week and 3.54 mg/week , for models 1 and 2 , respectively ) . However , more studies with other genes and environmental factors are needed to test and to improve the algorithm .
