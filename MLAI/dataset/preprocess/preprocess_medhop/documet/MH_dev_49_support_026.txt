The calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling pathway mediates the effect of corticotropin releasing factor and urocortins on catecholamine synthesis . The biological effects of the P06850 ( CRF ) family of neuropeptides are mediated by mobilization of [ Ca(2+) ] . Aim of the current work was to examine if the calcineurin/NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T-cells ) signaling pathway is involved in the effect of CRF peptides in catecholamine synthesis and secretion from PC12 rat pheochromocytona cells , a model for the study of adrenal catecholamine production . PC12 cells express both types of CRF receptors . Our data are as follows : ( a ) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) blocked norepinephrine secretion induced by ligands of either CRF type 1 ( CRF(1) ) or 2 ( CRF(2) ) receptors on PC12 cells . ( b ) Silencing O95644 expression using a selective O95644 siRNA blocked CRF(1) and CRF(2) -induced NE production . ( c ) CRF ligands induced NFAT transcriptional activity in cells transfected with a luciferase reporter construct controlled by NFAT binding elements ( NFAT-Luc ) . ( d ) DB00091 completely blocked the stimulatory effect of CRF(1) and CRF(2) ligands on NFAT activity in NFAT-Luc transfected cells . ( e ) PKA , PKC , p38-MAPK , Tpl2 , P01112 , and P31749 were crucial intermediates for both CRF(1) and CRF(2)-induced NFAT activation . Interestingly , Q02750 /2 and P27361 /2 were crucial only for the CRF(2)-induced NFAT activation . ( f ) p38-MAPK and Tpl2 were crucial intermediates for both CRF(1) and CRF(2)-induced norepinephrine production , while P31749 affected only CRF(2)-induced norepinephrine production . In conclusion , our data suggest that CRF(1) and CRF(2) ligands activate the transcription factor NFAT and its activation is prerequisite for CRF-induced catecholamine production from chromaffin cells .
