Safety of the novel protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist vorapaxar in Japanese patients with a history of ischemic stroke . BACKGROUND : DB09030 , formerly P35240 530348 , is a novel , orally active , potent thrombin receptor inhibitor selective for the protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) . Previous phase II studies of patients undergoing urgent or scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention treated with vorapaxar plus aspirin and clopidogrel or ticlopidine showed a trend toward reducing major adverse cardiac events , particularly myocardial infarction , without increasing bleeding risk . The present study evaluated the safety of vorapaxar in Japanese patients with a history of ischemic stroke receiving aspirin . METHODS : Ninety patients with previous ischemic stroke ( â‰¥14 days to < 1 year before randomization ) were randomized to receive vorapaxar ( 1 or 2.5 mg ) or placebo once daily for 60 days . All patients received aspirin ( 75-150 mg/day ) . The primary endpoint was overall incidence of adverse events during the protocol-defined treatment phase ( 60 days ) . RESULTS : Addition of vorapaxar to aspirin did not significantly increase the overall incidence of adverse events , including serious adverse events . None of the patients treated with vorapaxar plus aspirin experienced thrombolysis in myocardial infarction major or minor bleeding versus 1 patient treated with placebo . Nonfatal stroke occurred in 1 patient allocated to placebo and 1 patient allocated to vorapaxar . CONCLUSIONS : DB09030 used in combination with standard doses of aspirin was safe and well tolerated in Japanese subjects with a history of ischemic stroke .
