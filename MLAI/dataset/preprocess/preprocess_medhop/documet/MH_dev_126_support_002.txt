Development of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor DB00530 . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a transmembrane receptor involved in the regulation of a complex array of essential biological processes such as cell proliferation and survival . Dysregulation of the P00533 signaling network has been frequently reported in multiple human cancers and has been associated with the processes of tumor development , growth , proliferation , metastasis , and angiogenesis . Inhibition of the P00533 was associated with antitumor effects in preclinical models . On the basis of these data , therapeutics targeting the P00533 were explored in clinical trials . DB00530 is a small-molecule selective inhibitor of the P00533 tyrosine kinase . In preclinical studies , DB00530 inhibited the phosphorylation of the P00533 in a dose-dependent and concentration-dependent manner resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis . In in vivo studies , this agent caused tumor growth inhibition and showed synergistic effects when combined with conventional chemotherapy . Subsequent single-agent phase I studies and phase I studies in combination with chemotherapy showed that the agent has a good safety profile and induced tumor growth inhibition in a substantial number of patients with a variety of different solid tumors . Preliminary reports from phase II studies confirmed the excellent tolerability of DB00530 and showed encouraging preliminary activity . Phase III studies have either been completed or are ongoing in several tumor types such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer . In summary , DB00530 is a novel inhibitor of the P00533 tyrosine kinase that has shown promising activity in initial studies and is currently undergoing full development as an anticancer drug .
