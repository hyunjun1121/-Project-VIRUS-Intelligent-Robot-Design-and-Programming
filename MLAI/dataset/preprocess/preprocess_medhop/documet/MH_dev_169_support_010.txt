A chimeric murine/human antibody Fab fragment directed against the platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor enhances and sustains arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in baboons . Inhibition of the platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor with the murine monoclonal antibody 7E3 abolishes ex vivo platelet aggregation , reduces thrombogenicity , and sustains arterial recanalization with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) . A chimeric murine/human Fab fragment of DB00054 ( c7E3-Fab ) has a markedly reduced immunogenicity , but its potency as an adjunct for thrombolysis with rt-PA has not been evaluated . The effects of a single intravenous bolus injection of aspirin ( 17 mg/kg ) or c7E3-Fab ( 0.45 mg/kg ) on thrombolysis and reocclusion induced with rt-PA were studied in groups of six baboons with femoral arterial thrombosis and superimposed high-grade stenosis . This dose of c7E3-Fab blocked 96 +/- 1 % of the platelet P08514 /IIIa receptors and abolished ADP-induced platelet aggregation . Bolus intravenous injections of rt-PA ( 0.25 mg/kg ) were repeated at 15-minute intervals until reperfusion occurred ( maximum of four injections ) . In the aspirin group , reperfusion was obtained within 51 +/- 16 minutes ( mean +/- SD ) but was rapidly followed by reocclusion within 6 +/- 9 minutes and by cyclic reflow and reocclusion . In the c7E3-Fab group , reperfusion was obtained within 25 +/- 8 minutes ( P < .01 versus aspirin group ) and was associated with a delayed reocclusion of 63 +/- 63 minutes ( P < .05 versus aspirin group ) . Template bleeding times remained unchanged in the aspirin/rt-PA group but were markedly prolonged ( to > 30 minutes ) in the c7E3-Fab/rt-PA group. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
