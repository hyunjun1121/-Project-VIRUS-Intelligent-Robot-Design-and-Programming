Microenvironmental regulation of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase activity in ovarian carcinoma cells via collagen-induced P18146 expression . Late stage ovarian cancer is characterized by disseminated intraperitoneal metastasis as secondary lesions anchor in the type I and III collagen-rich submesothelial matrix . Ovarian carcinoma cells preferentially adhere to interstitial collagen , and collagen-induced integrin clustering up-regulates the expression of the transmembrane collagenase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( P50281 ) . Collagenolytic activity is important in intraperitoneal metastasis , potentiating invasion through the mesothelial cell layer and colonization of the submesothelial collagen-rich matrix . The objective of this study was to elucidate a potential mechanistic link between collagen adhesion and P50281 expression . Our results indicate that culturing cells on three-dimensional collagen gels , but not thin layer collagen or synthetic three-dimensional hydrogels , results in rapid induction of the transcription factor P18146 . Integrin signaling through a P12931 kinase-dependent pathway is necessary for P18146 induction . Silencing of P18146 expression using small interfering RNA abrogated collagen-induced P50281 expression and inhibited cellular invasion of three-dimensional collagen gels . These data support a model for intraperitoneal metastasis wherein collagen adhesion and clustering of collagen binding integrins activates integrin-mediated signaling via P12931 kinases to induce expression of P18146 , resulting in transcriptional activation of the P50281 promoter and subsequent P50281 -catalyzed collagen invasion . This model highlights the role of unique interactions between ovarian carcinoma cells and interstitial collagens in the ovarian tumor microenvironment in inducing gene expression changes that potentiate intraperitoneal metastatic progression .
