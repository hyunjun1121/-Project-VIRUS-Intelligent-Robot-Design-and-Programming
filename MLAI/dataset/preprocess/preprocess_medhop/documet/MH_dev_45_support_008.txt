NT-702 ( parogrelil hydrochloride , DB05505 ) , a novel and potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor , improves reduced walking distance and lowered hindlimb plantar surface temperature in a rat experimental intermittent claudication model . NT-702 ( parogrelil hydrochloride , DB05505 ) , 4-bromo-6-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)propoxy]-5-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino]pyridazin-3(2H)-one hydrochloride , a novel phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitor synthesized as a potent vasodilatory and antiplatelet agent , is being developed for the treatment of intermittent claudication ( IC ) in patients with peripheral arterial disease . We assessed the efficacy of NT-702 in an experimental IC model as compared with cilostazol and additionally investigated the pharmacological property in vitro and ex vivo . NT-702 selectively inhibited PDE3 ( IC(50)=0.179 and 0.260 nM for Q14432 and 3B ) more potently than cilostazol ( IC(50)=231 and 237 nM for Q14432 and 3B ) among recombinant human PDE1 to PDE6 . NT-702 inhibited in vitro human platelet aggregation induced by various agonists ( IC(50)=11 to 67 nM ) and phenylephrine-induced rat aortic contraction ( IC(50)=24 nM ) . Corresponding results for cilostazol were 4.1 to 17 microM and 1.0 microM , respectively . NT-702 ( 3 mg/kg or more ) significantly inhibited ex vivo rat platelet aggregation after a single oral dose . For cilostazol , 300 mg/kg was effective . In a rat femoral artery ligation model , NT-702 at 5 and 10 mg/kg repeated oral doses twice a day ( P55957 ) for 13 days significantly improved the reduced walking distance while the lowered plantar surface temperature was improved at 2.5 mg/kg and more . DB01166 also improved the walking distance and surface temperature at 300 mg/kg P55957 but significant difference was only observed for surface temperature on day 8 . These results suggest that NT-702 can be expected to have therapeutic advantage for IC .
