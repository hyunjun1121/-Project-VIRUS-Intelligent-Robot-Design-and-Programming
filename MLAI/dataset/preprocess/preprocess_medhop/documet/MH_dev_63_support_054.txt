P05231 and MYC collaborate in plasma cell tumor formation in mice . P05231 ( P05231 ) plays a critical role in the natural history of human plasma cell neoplasms ( PCNs ) , such as plasma cell myeloma and plasmacytoma ( PCT ) . P05231 is also at the center of neoplastic plasma cell transformation in BALB/c ( C ) mice carrying a transgene , H2-L(d)- P05231 , that encodes human P05231 under control of the major histocompatibility complex H2-L(d) promoter : strain C.H2-L(d)- P05231 . These mice are prone to PCT , but tumor development is incomplete with long latencies ( approximately 40 % PCT at 12 months of age ) . To generate a more robust mouse model of P05231 -dependent Q15149 , we intercrossed strain C.H2-L(d)- P05231 with strains C.iMyc(Emu) or C.iMyc(Calpha) , 2 interrelated gene-insertion models of the chromosomal T(12;15) translocation causing deregulated expression of Myc in mouse PCT . Deregulation of MYC is also a prominent feature of human Q15149 . We found that double-transgenic C.H2-L(d)- P05231 /iMyc(Emu) and C.H2-L(d)- P05231 /iMyc(Calpha) mice develop PCT with full penetrance ( 100 % tumor incidence ) and short latencies ( 3-6 months ) . The mouse tumors mimic molecular hallmarks of their human tumor counterparts , including elevated P05231 /Stat3/Bcl-X(L) signaling . The newly developed mouse strains may provide a good preclinical research tool for the design and testing of new approaches to target P05231 in treatment and prevention of human PCNs .
