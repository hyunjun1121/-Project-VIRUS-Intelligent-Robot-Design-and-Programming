Hypersensitivity reaction against influenza vaccine in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis after the initiation of etanercept injections . A 58-year-old Japanese woman with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) suffered from high fever triggered by administration of an influenza vaccine after a 4-month-long effective treatment course with the P01375 inhibitor etanercept . Influenza vaccine had been previously administrated safely to the patient before initiation of etanercept therapy . The fever occurred without other symptoms soon after vaccine administration , progressed to high fever 1 day later , and spontaneously resolved the second day . The clinical course appears to be compatible with drug fever closely associated with immediate hypersensitivity ( in particular , late-phase type I allergic reaction ) , in which T helper ( Th ) 2 cells play a crucial role . DB00005 can strongly suppress Th1-mediated reactions ; therefore , Th2 activity may be augmented by etanercept treatment in aspect of antagonism between Th1 and Th2 mechanisms . In RA patients who receive treatment with P01375 inhibitor such as etanercept , activation of Th2-mediated immune responses such as immediate hypersensitivity may be a necessary side effect for those who receive vaccinations .
