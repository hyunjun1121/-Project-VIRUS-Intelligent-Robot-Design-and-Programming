Purification and characterization of platelet aggregation inhibitors from snake venoms . Proteins that inhibit glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa mediated platelet aggregation have been purified from the venom of two snake species . A small platelet aggregation inhibitor ( p1.AI ) , multisquamatin ( Mr = 5,700 ) , was purified from Echis multisquamatus venom by hydrophobic interaction HPLC and two steps on C18 reverse phase HPLC . A larger p1.AI , contortrostatin ( Mr = 15,000 ) , was purified by a similar HPLC procedure from the venom of Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix . Both p1.AIs inhibit ADP-induced human , canine and rabbit platelet aggregation using platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) . Multisquamatin has an IC50 of 97 nM , 281 nM and 333 nM for human , canine and rabbit PRP , respectively . Contortrostatin has an IC50 of 49 nM , 120 nM and 1,150 nM for human , canine and rabbit PRP , respectively . In a competitive binding assay using 125I- DB00054 ( a monoclonal antibody to P08514 /IIIa that inhibits platelet aggregation ) both contortrostatin and multisquamatin demonstrated P08514 /IIIa specific binding to human and canine platelets . The IC50 for contortrostatin displacement of 7E3 binding to human and canine P08514 -/IIIa is 27 nM and 16 nM , respectively and for multisquamatin it is 3 nM and 63 nM , respectively . Our results indicate that both p1.AIs inhibit platelet aggregation by binding with high affinity to P08514 /IIIa .
