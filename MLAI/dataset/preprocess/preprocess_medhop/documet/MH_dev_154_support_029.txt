Emodin upregulates urokinase plasminogen activator , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and promotes wound healing in human fibroblasts . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) system is important for several biological processes that call for extracellular proteolysis , fibrinolysis , cell migration , proliferation and angiogenesis . The current study highlights the fibrinolytic and wound healing potential of emodin , an anthraquinone , with relevance to the uPA system . Emodin increased the fibrinolytic activity of fibroblast cells in a dose-dependent manner . Zymography linked the activity to increased uPA activity . Subsequent RT-PCR and western analyses demonstrated uPA gene upregulation . Interestingly , P05121 , the inhibitor of uPA was also upregulated . EMSA showed the upregulation occurred independent of emodin 's effect on nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) . The effect on uPA system is supposedly via generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) since cotreatment with ascorbic acid , an anti-oxidant , attenuated the activity . In addition to profibrinolytic potential , emodin also demonstrated wound healing activity in in vitro wound models . Presence of emodin in the medium enhanced the rate of migration of fibroblasts into the wounded region . These in vitro experiments reveal that emodin is a potent profibrinolytic and wound healing agent .
