DB00091 regulates the levels of cyclophilin A in neuroblastoma cells in culture . P62937 ( CyP-A ) , a member of a highly conserved family of proteins , immunophilins , is the major intracellular receptor for the immunosuppressive drug , cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) . CyP-A is widely expressed in many tissues , but is found in the highest concentration in brain tissues and may perform critical neuronal functions . DB00091 is a known neurotoxin . Therefore , understanding the regulation of CyP-A levels in nerve cells , particularly by DB00091 , is important . We have utilized murine neuroblastoma ( NB ) cells as an experimental model to investigate this issue . Our results show that DB00091 alone was sufficient to induce morphological differentiation in undifferentiated NB cells and to increase CyP-A levels as determined by immunostaining . However , inducing terminal differentiation by elevating adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate ( DB02527 ) levels using either 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone ( RO20-1724 ) , an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase , or prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) , a stimulator of adenylate cyclase , was not sufficient to increase CyP-A levels . DB00091 was required to increase CyP-A levels in both RO20-1724- and PGE1-induced differentiated NB cells . Increases in CyP-A levels , however , occurred without any change in the expression of the CyP-A gene as determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction analysis using ( CyP-A ) -specific primers . These results suggest that DB00091 regulates the level of its own binding protein , CyP-A , in both undifferentiated and DB02527 -induced differentiated NB cells in culture .
