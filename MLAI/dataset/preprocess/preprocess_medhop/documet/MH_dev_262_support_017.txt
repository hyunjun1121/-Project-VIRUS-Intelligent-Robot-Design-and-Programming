Expression pattern and cellular sources of chemokines in primary central nervous system lymphoma . The expression pattern of a subset of chemokines and their corresponding receptors was investigated in primary central nervous system lymphomas ( PCNSL ) . The tumor cells consistently expressed P61073 , P48061 , P32302 , and O43927 , both at mRNA and protein levels . Cerebral endothelial cells were positive for P48061 and O43927 , while reactive astrocytes and microglial cells expressed P48061 , P51681 , and CCR6 . Inflammatory T cells in PCNSL were characterized by P51681 and CCR6 positivity . Taken together , our data indicate a cell type-specific repertoire of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression in PCNSL suggesting that chemokine-mediated interactions facilitate crossing of the blood-brain barrier as well as intracerebral dissemination of PCNSL cells . In addition , chemokines expressed by tumor cells may contribute to induction of reactive glial changes and influence the composition of inflammatory infiltrates in PCNSL . Therefore , cell type specific expression of distinct chemokine profiles likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of PCNSL and may contribute to their characteristic histological appearance .
