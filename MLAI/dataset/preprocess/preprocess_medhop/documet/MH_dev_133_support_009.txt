Platelet-associated antibodies , cellular immunity and FCGR3a genotype influence the response to rituximab in immune thrombocytopenia . DB00073 is widely used in autoimmune diseases including immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , although the mechanism of effect remains unclear . This study describes the effects of rituximab on platelet-associated antibodies ( PA-APAs ) , B and T cell counts and clonality ( IGHV and TRG @ gene rearrangements ) , P08637 ( FcγRIIIa ) and P12318 ( FcγRIIa ) polymorphisms and correlation to anti- P29965 ( P29965 ) response . PA-APA levels fell more frequently in responders ( 6/8 ) than in non-responders ( 2/10 : P = 0·08-0·15 ) . Two responders had no PA-APAs . Two non-responders with a fall in PA-APAs had very high CD8 levels . One non-responder had a B cell clone , one responder and one non-responder had a T cell clone . 15/16 patients had the same responses to rituximab and antiCD40L . Patients with P08637 V/V polymorphisms were more likely to respond to rituximab ( P = 0·03 ) . In summary , the fall in PA-APAs in responders confirms the humoural effect of rituximab . Failure to respond in patients with very high CD8 levels , despite PA-APA fall indicates a role for T cell-mediated platelet/megakaryocyte destruction . Concordance of response to anti- P29965 suggests autoantibody-producing cells are under T cell control . Finally , the effect of FCGR polymorphisms on response confirms the importance of FCGR-mediated depletion of B cells in autoimmunity . This has implications on the pathology of ITP as well as the immunological effect of B cell depletion .
