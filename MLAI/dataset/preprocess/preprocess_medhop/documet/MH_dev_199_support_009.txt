DB09341 and fructose have sugar-specific effects in both liver and skeletal muscle in vivo : a role for liver fructokinase . We examined glucose and fructose effects on serine phosphorylation levels of a range of proteins in rat liver and muscle cells . For this , healthy adult rats were subjected to either oral glucose or fructose loads . A mini-array system was utilized to determine serine phosphorylation levels of liver and skeletal muscle proteins . A glucose oral load of 125 mg/100 g body weight ( G 1/2 ) did not induce changes in phosphorylated serines of the proteins studied . Loading with 250 mg/100 g body weight of fructose ( Fr ) , which induced similar glycemia levels as G 1/2 , significantly increased serine phosphorylation of liver cyclin D3 , P19957 kinase/p85 , P28482 , PTP2 and clusterin . The G 1/2 increased serine levels of the skeletal muscle proteins cyclin H , Cdk2 , P51617 , total PKC , P18031 , c-Raf 1 , Ras and the β-subunit of the insulin receptor . The Fr induced a significant increase only in muscle serine phosphorylation of P19957 kinase/p85 . The incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with 10 mM glucose for 5 min significantly increased serine phosphorylation of 31 proteins . In contrast , incubation with 10 mM fructose produced less intense effects . Incubation with 10 mM glucose plus 75 µM fructose counteracted the effects of the incubation with glucose alone , except those on P04049 and Ras . Less marked effects were detected in cultured muscle cells incubated with 10 mM glucose or 10 mM glucose plus 75 µM fructose . Our results suggest that glucose and fructose act as specific functional modulators through a general mechanism that involves liver-generated signals , like micromolar fructosemia , which would inform peripheral tissues of the presence of either glucose- or fructose-derived metabolites .
