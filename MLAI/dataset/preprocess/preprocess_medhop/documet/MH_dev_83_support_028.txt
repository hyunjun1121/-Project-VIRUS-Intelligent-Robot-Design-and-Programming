Steatohepatitis in laboratory opossums exhibiting a high lipemic response to dietary cholesterol and fat . Plasma VLDL and LDL cholesterol were markedly elevated ( > 40-fold ) in high-responding opossums , but moderately elevated ( 6-fold ) in low-responding opossums after they had consumed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet for 24 wk . In both high- and low-responding opossums , plasma triglycerides were slightly elevated , threefold and twofold , respectively . Dietary challenge also induced fatty livers in high responders , but not in low responders . We studied the lipid composition , histopathological features , and gene expression patterns of the fatty livers . Free cholesterol ( 2-fold ) , esterified cholesterol ( 11-fold ) , and triglycerides ( 2-fold ) were higher in the livers of high responders than those in low responders , whereas free fatty acid levels were similar . The fatty livers of high responders showed extensive lobular disarray by histology . Inflammatory cells and ballooned hepatocytes were also present , as were perisinusoidal fibrosis and ductular proliferation . In contrast , liver histology was normal in low responders . Hepatic gene expression revealed differences associated with the development of steatohepatitis in high responders . The accumulation of hepatic cholesterol was concomitant with upregulation of the P04035 gene and downregulation of the Q02318 , Q9H221 , and P21439 genes . Genes involved in inflammation ( P01375 , P19838 , and P35354 ) and in oxidative stress ( P13498 and P14598 ) were upregulated . Upregulation of the growth factor genes ( PDGF and P01137 ) and collagen genes ( Col1A1 , Col3A1 , and Col4A1 ) was consistent with fibrosis . Some of the histological characteristics of the fatty livers of high-responding opossums imitate those in the livers of humans with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis .
