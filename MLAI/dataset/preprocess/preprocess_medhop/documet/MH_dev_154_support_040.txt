P00747 activator production in a rat model of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . Several studies have indicated that the serine protease urokinase-plasminogen-activator ( uPA ) is an important factor in host defense against pulmonary pathogens . To gain a better insight into the role of uPA in Pneumocystis carinii ( P. carinii ) pneumonia ( PCP ) , we evaluated PA production in alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) obtained from rats with steroid-induced PCP . Treatment with cortisone acetate favored PCP in 91 % of rats . In the bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) samples of immunosuppressed rats both with and without PCP , we observed a decrease in uPA activity as well as a decrease in cell number . DB00013 -PA production by AMs was reduced in rats treated with cortisone alone . However , an increase in cell-associated uPA was observed in rats with PCP . This increase appears to be produced in response to P carinii infection . In fact , when AMs obtained from untreated healthy or immunosuppressed uninfected rats were challenged with P carinii , a significant increase in PA activity in cell lysates was observed , though a lower response was obtained in cortisone-treated animals . Our results suggest that healthy AMs respond to the presence of P carinii with an increase in uPA production and that this response in immunodepressed rat-AMs is partially impaired .
