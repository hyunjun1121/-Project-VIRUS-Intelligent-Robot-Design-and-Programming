Preliminary evidence of ethnic divergence in associations of putative genetic variants for methamphetamine dependence . Research into the biological processes that increase susceptibility to methamphetamine dependence has been conducted primarily in Asian populations . Using a case-control design this study 's purpose was to explore , among a population of methamphetamine-dependent Caucasians , six putative single nucleotide polymorphisms previously found to be associated with methamphetamine dependence in Asian populations . A total of 193 non-psychotic males ( 117 methamphetamine-dependent and 76 controls ) were genotyped for variants located in six genes ( P31749 , P32121 , P23560 , P21964 , P09211 , P35372 ) . Genotypic and allelic frequencies , odds ratios , and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated . None of the putative gene associations was significantly replicated in our sample of Caucasian men . Effect size comparisons suggest a trend toward allelic divergence for arrestin beta 2 ( P32121 ) and glutathione S-transferase P1 ( P09211 ) and allelic convergence for brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) . Results provide preliminary support for further exploration and validation of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for methamphetamine ( METH ) dependence reported among Asian populations across other ethnic/ancestral groups .
