Ca2+-calmodulin and janus kinase 2 are required for activation of sodium-proton exchange by the Gi-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine 1a receptor . The type 1 sodium-proton exchanger ( P19634 ) is expressed ubiquitously and regulates key cellular functions , including mitogenesis , cell volume , and intracellular pH . Despite its importance , the signaling pathways that regulate P19634 remain incompletely defined . In this work , we present evidence that stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A ( P08908 ) receptor results in the formation of a signaling complex that includes activated O60674 ( Jak2 ) , Ca2+/calmodulin ( P62158 ) , and P19634 , and which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 . The signaling pathway also involves rapid agonist-induced association of P62158 and P19634 as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation studies and by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in living cells . We propose that P19634 is activated through this pathway : P08908 receptor --> G(i2)alpha and/or G(i3)alpha --> Jak2 activation --> tyrosine phosphorylation of P62158 --> increased binding of P62158 to P19634 --> induction of a conformational change in P19634 that unmasks an obscured proton-sensing and/or proton-transporting region of P19634 --> activation of P19634 . The G(i/o)-coupled P08908 receptor now joins a handful of Gq-coupled receptors and hypertonic shock as upstream activators of this emerging pathway . In the course of this work , we have presented clear evidence that P62158 can be activated through tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of a significant role for elevated intracellular Ca2+ . We have also shown for the first time that the association of P62158 with P19634 in living cells is a dynamic process .
