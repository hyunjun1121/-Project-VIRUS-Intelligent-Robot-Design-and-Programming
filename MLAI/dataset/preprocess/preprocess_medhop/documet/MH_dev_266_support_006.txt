P00747 activation initiated by single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator . Potentiation by U937 monocytes . The binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activators ( u-PA ) to receptors on various cell types has been proposed to be an important feature of many cellular processes requiring extracellular proteolysis . We have investigated the effect of single-chain u-PA binding to the monocyte-like cell line U937 on plasminogen activation . A 16-fold acceleration of the activation of plasminogen was observed at optimal concentrations of single-chain u-PA . This potentiation was abolished by the addition of either DB00513 or the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA , thus demonstrating the requirement for specific binding of both single-chain u-PA and plasminogen to the cells . The mechanism of the enhancement of plasmin generation appears to be due primarily to an increase in the rate of feedback activation of single-chain u-PA to the more active two-chain u-PA by cell-bound plasmin , initially generated by single-chain u-PA . This increased activity of the plasminogen activation system in the presence of U937 cells provides a mechanism whereby u-PAs may exert their influence in a variety of cell-associated proteolytic events .
