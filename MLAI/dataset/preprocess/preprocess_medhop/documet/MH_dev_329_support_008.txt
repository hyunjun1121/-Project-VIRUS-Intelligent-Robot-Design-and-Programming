Inhibition of tumor cell growth , invasion , and metastasis by EXEL-2880 ( DB05030 , GSK1363089 ) , a novel inhibitor of P14210 and P15692 receptor tyrosine kinases . The DB00134 receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) , are overexpressed and/or activated in a wide variety of human malignancies . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) receptors are expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and cooperate with DB00134 to induce tumor invasion and vascularization . EXEL-2880 ( DB05030 , GSK1363089 ) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that targets members of the P14210 and P15692 receptor tyrosine kinase families , with additional inhibitory activity toward P10721 , Flt-3 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta , and Tie-2 . Binding of EXEL-2880 to DB00134 and P15692 receptor 2 ( P35968 ) is characterized by a very slow off-rate , consistent with X-ray crystallographic data showing that the inhibitor is deeply bound in the DB00134 kinase active site cleft . EXEL-2880 inhibits cellular P14210 -induced DB00134 phosphorylation and P15692 -induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and prevents both P14210 -induced responses of tumor cells and P14210 / P15692 -induced responses of endothelial cells . In addition , EXEL-2880 prevents anchorage-independent proliferation of tumor cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions . In vivo , these effects produce significant dose-dependent inhibition of tumor burden in an experimental model of lung metastasis . Collectively , these data indicate that EXEL-2880 may prevent tumor growth through a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and by inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis mediated by P14210 and P15692 receptors .
