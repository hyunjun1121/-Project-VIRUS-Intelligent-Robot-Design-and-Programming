Functional characterization of the novel antipsychotic iloperidone at human D2 , D3 , alpha 2C , P50406 , and P08908 receptors . DB04946 has demonstrated an interesting monoamine receptor profile in radioligand binding studies , with nanomolar affinity for certain noradrenaline , dopamine , and serotonin receptors . In this study , the agonist/antagonist activity of iloperidone was determined in cell lines expressing recombinant human D(2A) , D(3) , alpha(2C) , 5-HT(1A) , or 5-HT(6) receptors . With the exception of 5-HT(6) receptors , these receptors are negatively coupled to cyclase . Thus , after stimulation with forskolin , the agonists dopamine ( at D(2A) and D(3) ) , noradrenaline ( at alpha(2C) ) , or 8-OH-DPAT ( at 5-HT(1A) ) induced a reduction in DB02527 accumulation . Conversely , activation of the 5-HT(6) receptor by 5-HT led to an increase in DB02527 accumulation . DB04946 alone was devoid of significant agonist activity but inhibited the agonist response in all 5 cell lines in a surmountable and concentration-dependent fashion . DB04946 was most potent at D(3) receptors ( pK(B) 8.59 +/- 0.20 ; n = 6 ) , followed by alpha(2C) ( pK(B) 7.83 +/- 0.06 ; n = 15 ) , 5-HT(1A) ( pK(B) 7.69 +/- 0.18 ; n = 10 ) , D(2A) ( pK(B) 7.53 +/- 0.04 ; n = 11 ) and 5-HT(6) ( pK(B) 7.11 +/- 0.08 ; n = 11 ) receptors .
