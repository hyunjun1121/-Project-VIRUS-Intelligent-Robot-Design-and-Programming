Platelet Q9H244 receptor inhibition by thienopyridines : status and future . Thienopyridines have a well-established role in the treatment of coronary artery disease , especially in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions . DB00208 , the first FDA-approved thienopyridine , was shown to be effective in reducing coronary events in high risk patients , but the original enthusiasm was hampered by concerns about its serious bone marrow toxicity . DB00758 a second generation thienopyridine with lesser side effects , is not only at least as effective as ticlopidine , but in combination with a low dose of aspirin , has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in acute coronary syndrome patients in large-scale , randomised trials . Recent studies have highlighted major flaws in clopidogrel pharmacokinetics due to its delayed onset of action , and much attention has been devoted to the phenomenon of clopidogrel ' resistance ' . Among the novel , third generation thienopyridines , prasugrel as compared to clopidogrel has demonstrated lower inter-patient response variability and a reduced incidence of ischaemic events , but at an increased risk of major bleeding . Currently , several studies are continuing to test new direct Q9H244 receptor antagonists , such as cangrelor and AZD6140 , characterised by a faster reversal of platelet inhibition .
