DB00142 decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) antibodies in epilepsy : diagnostic yield and therapeutic implications . PURPOSE : The aetiology of adult onset epilepsy remains unascertained in a significant proportion of patients . Antibodies directed against neuronal antigens have been suggested to have a potential pathogenic role in some cases of epilepsy . We describe a series of patients with adult onset epilepsy in whom antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase ( Q99259 Abs ) have been identified . METHODS : All patients attending a regional epilepsy service with unexplained adult onset epilepsy ' were tested for the presence of Q99259 Abs . Those with high serum titres underwent P04141 analysis , and were offered additional treatment with immunotherapy . Those who underwent immunotherapy were monitored by monthly review . Clinical details and response to treatment was collated by review of notes . RESULTS : Of 112 patients tested , high serum titres were found in 6 ( 5.4 % ) patients . These patients had clinical and electroencephalographic evidence of focal epilepsy . P04141 analysis revealed oligoclonal bands and intrathecal Q99259 Abs in all patients . Five patients received immunotherapy . No improvement in seizures was observed in any . One patient with equivocal Q9BWK5 evidence of hippocampal sclerosis and concordant video EEG and PET scan , achieved 12 months seizure freedom following temporal lobectomy . CONCLUSIONS : The relevance of Q99259 Abs to epilepsy remains uncertain . Our experience does not support the routine use of immunotherapy in patients with epilepsy and Q99259 Abs . Larger studies enrolling greater numbers of patients are required to identify sufficient numbers of patients for controlled treatment trials .
