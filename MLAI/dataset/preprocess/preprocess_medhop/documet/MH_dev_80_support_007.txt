Review : anti- P16410 antibody ipilimumab : case studies of clinical response and immune-related adverse events . The immune system is a powerful natural agent against cancer . Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 ( P16410 ) , a key negative regulator of T-cell responses , can restrict the antitumor immune response . DB06186 ( DB06186 ) is a fully human , monoclonal antibody that overcomes P16410 -mediated T-cell suppression to enhance the immune response against tumors . Preclinical and early clinical studies of patients with advanced melanoma show that ipilimumab promotes antitumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with treatments such as chemotherapy , vaccines , or cytokines . Emerging data on the kinetics of response to ipilimumab and associated adverse events are increasing our understanding about how to manage patients treated with this therapy . For example , short-term tumor progression prior to delayed regression has been observed in ipilimumab-treated patients , and objective responses may be of prolonged duration . In some patients clinical improvement manifests as stable disease , which may also extend for months or years . Immune-related adverse events ( IRAEs ) have been observed in patients after P16410 blockade and most likely reflect the drug mechanism of action and corresponding effects on the immune system . Early clinical data suggest a correlation between IRAEs and response to ipilimumab treatment . This paper briefly reviews the results from several ongoing and completed ipilimumab clinical trials , provides a synopsis of current trials , and presents several cases that demonstrate the kinetics of antitumor responses and the relationship to IRAEs in patients receiving ipilimumab .
