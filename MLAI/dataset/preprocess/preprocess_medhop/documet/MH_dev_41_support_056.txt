DB00087 as a bridge to allogeneic P09683 in atypical hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis . BACKGROUND : A 39-year-old woman with no relevant medical or family history was admitted to hospital with episodic fever , which persisted despite antibiotic therapy . Other notable findings at admission were splenomegaly , pancytopenia , hyponatremia , elevated levels of liver enzymes , hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia . INVESTIGATIONS : Physical examination , laboratory tests , rheumatic marker serology , pathogen detection assays , complete blood counts , measurement of levels of ferritin , fibrinogen , triglycerides and soluble CD25 , natural killer cell functional studies , P14222 mutation analysis , renal biopsy , bone marrow biopsy , CT imaging of the chest and abdomen . DIAGNOSIS : Idiopathic , atypical hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis . MANAGEMENT : Initial treatment with antibiotics was followed by immunosuppressive therapy ( including intravenous immunoglobulin , ciclosporin , infliximab , corticosteroids and etoposide ) . Remission was achieved by treatment with the anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody , alemtuzumab , after which allogeneic stem-cell transplantation ( with reduced-intensity conditioning treatment and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis ) resulted in a definitive cure .
