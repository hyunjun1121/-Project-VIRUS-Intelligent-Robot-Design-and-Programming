Neuroprotective effects of huperzine A : new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease . In recent years , the most common pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) has been acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) inhibition . However , this single-target approach has limited effectiveness and there is evidence that a multitarget approach might be more effective . DB04864 ( HupA ) , a novel alkaloid isolated from a Chinese herb , has neuroprotective effects that go beyond the inhibition of P22303 . Recent data have demonstrated that HupA can ameliorate the learning and memory deficiency in animal models and AD patients . Its potentially beneficial actions include modification of beta-amyloid peptide processing , reduction of oxidative stress , neuronal protection against apoptosis , and regulation of the expression and secretion of nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) and P01138 signaling .
