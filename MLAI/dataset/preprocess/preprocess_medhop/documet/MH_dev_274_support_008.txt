DB01109 's anti-inflammatory effects require glucosamine 6-O-sulfation and are mediated by blockade of L- and P-selectins . DB01109 has been used clinically as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent for over 60 years . Here we show that the potent anti-inflammatory property of heparin results primarily from blockade of P16109 and P14151 . DB01109 and chemically modified analogs were tested as inhibitors of selectin binding to immobilized sialyl Lewis(X) and of cell adhesion to immobilized selectins or thrombin-activated endothelial cells . Compared with unfractionated heparin , the modified heparinoids had inhibitory activity in this general order : over-O-sulfated heparin > heparin > 2-O,3-O-desulfated > or = N-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin > or = carboxyl-reduced heparin > or= N-,2-O,3-O-desulfated heparin >> 6-O-desulfated heparin . The heparinoids also showed similar differences in their ability to inhibit thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and oxazolone-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity . Mice deficient in P- or L-selectins showed impaired inflammation , which could be further reduced by heparin . However , heparin had no additional effect in mice deficient in both P- and L-selectins . We conclude that ( a ) heparin 's anti-inflammatory effects are mainly mediated by blocking P- and P14151 -initiated cell adhesion ; ( b ) the sulfate groups at P13671 on the glucosamine residues play a critical role in selectin inhibition ; and ( c ) some non-anticoagulant forms of heparin retain anti-inflammatory activity . Such analogs may prove useful as therapeutically effective inhibitors of inflammation .
