Leukotriene B4 amplifies NF-κB activation in mouse macrophages by reducing O15524 inhibition of MyD88 expression . Activation of NF-κB and P09917 -mediated ( P09917 -mediated ) biosynthesis of the lipid mediator leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) are pivotal components of host defense and inflammatory responses . However , the role of LTB4 in mediating innate immune responses elicited by specific TLR ligands and cytokines is unknown . Here we have shown that responses dependent on MyD88 ( an adaptor protein that mediates signaling through all of the known TLRs , except O15455 , as well as IL-1β and Q14116 ) are reduced in mice lacking either P09917 or the LTB4 receptor BTL1 , and that macrophages from these mice are impaired in MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB . This macrophage defect was associated with lower basal and inducible expression of MyD88 and reflected impaired activation of P42224 and overexpression of the P42224 inhibitor O15524 . Expression of MyD88 and responsiveness to the O00206 ligand LPS were decreased by Stat1 siRNA silencing in WT macrophages and restored by Socs1 siRNA in P09917 -deficient macrophages . These results uncover a pivotal role in macrophages for the GPCR Q15722 in regulating activation of NF-κB through Stat1-dependent expression of MyD88 .
