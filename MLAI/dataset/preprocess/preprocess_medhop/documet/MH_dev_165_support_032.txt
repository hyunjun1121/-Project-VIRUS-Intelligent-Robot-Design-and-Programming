Preclinical evaluation of sunitinib as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma . PURPOSE : DB01268 is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors , platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( P09619 ) , c-kit and P07949 . Several of these RTKs are known to be involved in the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . Here , we evaluated the preclinical activities of sunitinib in NPC . METHOD : We determined the basal level of total and phosphorylated P09619 , c-kit and P07949 by immunoblotting in a panel of five NPC cell lines . The effect of sunitinib on NPC cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay . We further studied the effect of sunitinib on NPC cell cycle progression and apoptosis . We investigated the in vitro and in vivo activities of sunitinib as single agent and in combination with cisplatin or docetaxel in NPC cell lines and tumor xenografts . RESULTS : DB01268 exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in all NPC cell lines tested with IC(50) between 2-7.5 Î¼M and maximum inhibition of over 97 % . DB01268 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase . In vitro , sunitinib moderately enhanced the growth inhibition of cisplatin or docetaxel . Single agent sunitinib demonstrated significant growth inhibition , reduced microvessel density and caused extensive tumor necrosis in a NPC xenograft model . However , concurrent administration of sunitinib and docetaxel induced severe toxicity in mice without enhanced antitumor effect . CONCLUSIONS : Single agent sunitinib demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibition in NPC . When combined with chemotherapy , sequential instead of concurrent administration schedule should be further explored .
