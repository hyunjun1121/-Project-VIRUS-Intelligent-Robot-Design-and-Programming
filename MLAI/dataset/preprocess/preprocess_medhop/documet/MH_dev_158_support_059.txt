Host cell species-specific effect of cyclosporine A on simian immunodeficiency virus replication . BACKGROUND : An understanding of host cell factors that affect viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for determination of viral tropism . P62937 ( CypA ) , a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) , is a host factor essential for efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in human cells . However , the role of cyclophilins in simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) replication has not been determined . In the present study , we examined the effect of cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , a PPIase inhibitor , on SIV replication . RESULTS : SIV replication in human CEM-SS T cells was not inhibited but rather enhanced by treatment with DB00091 , which inhibited HIV-1 replication . DB00091 treatment of target human cells enhanced an early step of SIV replication . CypA overexpression enhanced the early phase of HIV-1 but not SIV replication , while CypA knock-down resulted in suppression of HIV-1 but not SIV replication in CEM-SS cells , partially explaining different sensitivities of HIV-1 and SIV replication to DB00091 treatment . In contrast , DB00091 treatment inhibited SIV replication in macaque T cells ; DB00091 treatment of either virus producer or target cells resulted in suppression of SIV replication . SIV infection was enhanced by CypA overexpression in macaque target cells . CONCLUSIONS : DB00091 treatment enhanced SIV replication in human T cells but abrogated SIV replication in macaque T cells , implying a host cell species-specific effect of DB00091 on SIV replication . Further analyses indicated a positive effect of CypA on SIV infection into macaque but not into human T cells . These results suggest possible contribution of CypA to the determination of SIV tropism .
