P02787 subtypes and variants in Germany ; further evidence for a Tf null allele . Isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) with carrier ampholytes was used for the determination of transferrin C subtypes and transferrin B and D variants in a sample of 1125 unrelated individuals from Southern Germany . The observed TfC allele frequencies were Tf*C1 = 0.7872 , Tf* P06681 = 0.1365 , and Tf* P01024 = 0.0675 . The rare C subtype P13671 was observed twice . A new C subtype , called Q99622 , was observed and identified by IEF with immobilized pH gradients . The rare C subtypes C4 and Q99618 were also studied by this method . TfB and TfD variants were found with a heterozygous frequency of 1.53 % . One new TfD was found which is located between D1 and D2 and therefore named D1-2 . Evidence for a Tf null allele was obtained in a child and the putative father ; they were considered to be heterozygous for an allele Tf0 . The theoretical exclusion rate for paternity examinations was calculated for the Tf system and found to be 17.95 % .
