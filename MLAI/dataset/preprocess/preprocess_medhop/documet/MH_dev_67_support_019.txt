In vitro effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) analogue on cancer cell sensitivity to cis-platinum . Six endometrial cancer cell lines ( Ishikawa , EIIL , HEC1A , 6 , 50 and 59 ) , one breast cancer cell line ( MCF-7 ) and two ovarian cancer cell lines ( OVHS-1 , HRA ) were treated for 24 or 168 h with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) analogue , DB06719 acetate , and the cellular growth profile was studied . All these cell lines except for the HRA line had positive P30968 mRNA expression detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . GnRHa suppressed cell growth after 168 h of exposure , but not after 24 h . Suppression of cell growth by the exposure to cis-platinum ( DB00515 , 10 nM for 24 h ) was significantly increased in the presence of GnRHa for 168 h . The mechanism of this growth inhibition was tested by examining both RNA components of human telomerase ( hTR ) expression and telomerase activity . The results showed that GnRHa inhibits telomerase activity without altering the RNA component of telomerase expression . The present data suggest that DB00644 analogue may modulate endometrial , breast and ovarian cancer cell growth through modifying the telomerase activity . Since GnRHa increased the cytotoxic effects of DB00515 and GnRHa is a compound of high patient compliance , the value of GnRHa as a tumor sensitizer to DB00515 should be further tested in clinical trials .
