Molecular basis of functional gastrointestinal disorders . There are a number of abnormalities of gastrointestinal function , including sensory and motor dysfunction , which are believed to play a role in the manifestation of symptoms in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGID ) . In addition , there is a remarkable psychiatric comorbidity . Family and twin studies have provided strong evidence for a clustering of FGID in families and an increased concordance in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins . This points towards the role of one or more hereditary ( genetic ) factors . Considering these disorders of function and the psychiatric comorbidity , polymorphisms of adrenergic , opioidergic or serotonergic receptors as well as G-protein beta3 ( P16520 ) subunit gene polymorphisms ( C825T ) and polymorphisms of 5-HT transporter genes are suitable causes . In addition , mediators or regulators of mucosal inflammation may trigger events that ultimately result in the manifestation of FGID . Thus , relevant polymorphisms of genes with immunmodulating and/or neuromodulating features ( P35372 , P05112 , IL-4R , TNFalpha ) may also play a role in the manifestation of FGIDs .
