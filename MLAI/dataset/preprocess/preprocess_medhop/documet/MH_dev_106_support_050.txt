P08235 antagonism in the treatment of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy : a pilot study . PURPOSE : Based on experimental data showing that central serous chorioretinopathy could result from overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in choroid vessels , the authors studied eplerenone , a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , as a potential treatment for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy . METHODS : This nonrandomized pilot study included 13 patients with central serous chorioretinopathy of at least 4-month duration , treated with 25 mg/day of oral eplerenone for a week followed by 50 mg/day for 1 or 3 months . The primary outcome measure was the changes in central macular thickness recorded by optical coherence tomography , and the secondary outcomes included changes in foveal subretinal fluid ( P11831 ) measured by O75051 , in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) and the percentage of eyes achieving complete resolution of subretinal fluid during the treatment period . RESULTS : Central macular thickness decreased significantly from 352 ± 139 μm at baseline to 246 ± 113 μm and 189 ± 99 μm at 1 and 3 months under eplerenone treatment ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 , respectively ) . At 3 months , the subretinal fluid significantly decreased compared with baseline subretinal fluid ( P < 0.01 ) and best-corrected visual acuity significantly improved compared with baseline best-corrected visual acuity ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION : DB00700 treatment was associated with a significant reduction in central macular thickness , subretinal fluid level , and an improvement in visual acuity . Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these encouraging results .
