The agonist activity of tamoxifen is inhibited by the short heterodimer partner orphan nuclear receptor in human endometrial cancer cells . Short heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) is an orphan nuclear receptor that interacts with ER(alpha) and ERbeta and inhibits E2-induced transcription . We examined how Q15466 affects tamoxifen 's estrogen agonist activity in endometrial cells . We report that Q15466 interacts with 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) or E2-occupied ER(alpha) in a temperature-dependent manner in vitro . In transient transfection assays , Q15466 inhibited DB04468 -stimulated reporter gene activity from an estrogen response element ( ERE ) in ER-positive RL95-2 but not in O14777 -1A human endometrial carcinoma cells transfected with ER(alpha) or ERbeta . Q15466 inhibited E2-induced transcriptional activity in ER(alpha)- or ERbeta-transfected O14777 -1A or Chinese hamster ovary- P04264 cells . Q15466 inhibition of E2 activity was greater for ER(alpha) than ERbeta from the nonpalindromic ERE in the pS2 gene promoter in Chinese hamster ovary- P04264 but not O14777 -1A cells . Thus , ER subtype , cell type , and ERE sequence influence Q15466 repressor activity . An ER(alpha) mutant lacking activator function-1 showed reduced inhibition by Q15466 . In glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments , Q15466 inhibited ER(alpha) dimerization , providing a possible mechanism to account for the inhibitory effect of Q15466 on ER activity . These results identify Q15466 as novel target for blocking DB04468 agonist activity in endometrial cells .
