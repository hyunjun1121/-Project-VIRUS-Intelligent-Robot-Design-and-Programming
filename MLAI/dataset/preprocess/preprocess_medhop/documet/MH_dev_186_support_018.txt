Bradykinin stimulates glutamate uptake via both P46663 and P30411 activation in a human retinal pigment epithelial cells . AIMS : We were to examine the effect of bradykinin ( BK ) in the regulation of glutamate transporter and its related signaling molecules in a human retinal pigment epithelial ( ARPE ) cells , which are important cells to support retina . MAIN METHODS : d-[2,3-(3)H]-aspartate uptake , western immunoblotting , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , [ (3)H ] -arachidonic acid release , and siRNA transfection techniques were used . KEY FINDINGS : BK stimulated glutamate uptake as well as the mRNA expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 4 ( P48664 ) and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 ( P43005 ) , which was blocked by treatment with bradykinin 1 receptor ( P46663 ) and bradykinin 2 receptor ( P30411 ) siRNA , suggesting the role of P46663 and P30411 in this process . The BK-induced stimulation of glutamate uptake was also blocked by [ des- DB00125 (10) ] - DB06196 , a P46663 antagonist , and DB06196 , a P30411 antagonist , as well as by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A . In addition , the BK-induced stimulation of glutamate uptake was blocked by treatment with the phospholipase A(2) inhibitors mepacrine and AACOCF(3) , the cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) inhibitor indomethacin , and the P35354 inhibitor Dup 697 . Furthermore , the BK-induced increase in P35354 expression was blocked by the P19957 kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 , Akt inhibitor , and the protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitors staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide I , suggesting the role of P19957 kinase and PKC in this process . BK stimulated Akt activation and the translocation of PKC activation via the activation of P46663 and P30411 . SIGNIFICANCE : BK stimulates glutamate uptake through a PKC-Akt- P35354 signaling cascade in ARPE cells .
