Introduction to the use of belatacept : a fusion protein for the prevention of posttransplant kidney rejection . The development of new immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation resulted both in better short-term outcomes and in decreased metabolic , cardiovascular , and nephrotoxicity risk . DB06681 belongs to a new class of immunosuppressive drugs that selectively inhibits T-cell activation by preventing P10747 activation and by binding its ligands P33681 -1 and P33681 -2 . The result is an inactivation of costimulatory pathways . A comparative analysis of the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT datasets showed belatacept regimens resulted in better cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles than did cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) regimens : belatacept likewise outperformed DB00091 in terms of lower blood pressure and serum lipids and less new onset diabetes after transplantation . About 20 % of belatacept-treated patients developed adverse effects which included anemia , pyrexia , neutropenia , diarrhea , urinary tract infection , headache , and peripheral edema . At present , belatacept does not seem to predispose patients to a higher rate of infection than DB00091 maintenance immunosuppression . The risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases was higher in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -seronegative patients than in EBV-seropositive patients , but the risk may be reduced by use of a less intensive regimen and avoidance of EBV-negative patients and of patients whose pretransplant EBV serology is unknown . DB06681 provides a new option for immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplantation , but needs further evaluation in terms of the late effects that may derive from prolonged blockage of the costimulatory system and the induction of tolerance status .
