Sources contributing to the average extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens . Mesolimbic dopamine neurons fire in both tonic and phasic modes resulting in detectable extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) . In the past , different techniques have targeted dopamine levels in the NAc to establish a basal concentration . In this study , we used in vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) in the NAc of awake , freely moving rats . The experiments were primarily designed to capture changes in dopamine caused by phasic firing - that is , the measurement of dopamine ' transients ' . These FSCV measurements revealed for the first time that spontaneous dopamine transients constitute a major component of extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc . A series of experiments were designed to probe regulation of extracellular dopamine . DB00281 was infused into the ventral tegmental area , the site of dopamine cell bodies , to arrest neuronal firing . While there was virtually no instantaneous change in dopamine concentration , longer sampling revealed a decrease in dopamine transients and a time-averaged decrease in the extracellular level . Dopamine transporter inhibition using intravenous GBR12909 injections increased extracellular dopamine levels changing both frequency and size of dopamine transients in the NAc . To further unmask the mechanics governing extracellular dopamine levels we used intravenous injection of the vesicular monoamine transporter ( Q05940 ) inhibitor , tetrabenazine , to deplete dopamine storage and increase cytoplasmic dopamine in the nerve terminals . DB04844 almost abolished phasic dopamine release but increased extracellular dopamine to âˆ¼500 nM , presumably by inducing reverse transport by dopamine transporter ( Q01959 ) . Taken together , data presented here show that average extracellular dopamine in the NAc is low ( 20-30 nM ) and largely arises from phasic dopamine transients .
