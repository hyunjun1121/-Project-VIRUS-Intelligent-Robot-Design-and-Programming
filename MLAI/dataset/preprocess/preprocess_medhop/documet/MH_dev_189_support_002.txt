DB04894 labeled with Tc-99m for imaging tumors . DB04894 ( RC-160 ) , an octapeptide analog of somatostatin , has a high affinity for somatostatin receptor subtypes P30874 and P35346 . DB04894 binds differently to the tumors of the breast , ovary , exocrine pancreas , prostate and colon , than octreotide another octapeptide analog of somatostatin . DB04894 was labeled with Tc-99m , a radionuclide highly suitable for scintigraphic imaging . The labeling procedure was simple , produced > 70 % yields and could be applicable to label other peptides containing a cystine bridge . HPLC analysis showed that the tracer was stable when Tc-99m-RC-160 was challenged with 100 fold molar excess DTPA ( diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ) , HSA ( human serum albumin ) or cysteine and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 h . HPLC analysis of urine samples obtained from mice that received Tc-99m-RC-160 showed that the preparation was stable in vivo . Rat brain cortex membrane receptor displacement assays showed that the Kd values for Tc-99m-RC-160 ( 71x10(-9) M ) and Tc-99m-octreotide ( 86x10(-9) M ) ( Sandostatin(R) ) were in nM range , and were similar to that for I-125-RC-160 ( 46x10(-9) M ) . High binding affinity of Tc-99m-RC-160 for human breast tumor cells SKBR-3 was also observed . These results suggest that Tc-99m-RC-160 is worthy of evaluation as an agent for scintigraphic imaging of tumors rich in somatostatin receptor subtypes P30874 and P35346 .
