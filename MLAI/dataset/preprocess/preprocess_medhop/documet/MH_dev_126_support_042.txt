P40763 signaling is induced by intercellular adhesion in squamous cell carcinoma cells . The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 ( P40763 ) frequently activated during tumor progression has been linked to enhanced cell growth . In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( HNSCC ) , P40763 signaling has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and induce a more aggressive phenotype through the activation of specific signaling pathways . In the present study , we have examined the potential mechanism by which cell-cell contact initiates P40763 activation . Using a panel of HNSCC cell lines , Ca(+2)-dependent cell-cell adhesion and adherens junction formation in multicellular aggregates triggered phosphorylation of P40763 -Y705 and P42224 -Y701 . This intercellular adhesion-induced P40763 activation was mediated by JAK and Src signaling and partially by P00533 signaling . In addition , immunolocalization studies revealed initial formation of phosphorylated P40763 -Y705 at nascent P12830 cell junctions with eventual translocation to the nucleus in cell aggregates . Adhesion-mediated P35610 activation in monolayer and cell aggregate cultures required functional P12830 . These results indicate that , in HNSCC cells , cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion induces P35610 signaling that may modulate cell survival and resistance to apoptosis during tumor progression .
