P01375 alpha inhibition as treatment modality for certain rheumatologic and gastrointestinal diseases . With the development of biologicals that specifically target tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 )alpha , our therapeutic approach to inflammatory diseases has dramatically changed . There are currently three anti-TNFalpha drugs available : etanercept , infliximab , and adalimumab . DB00005 is a recombinant fusion protein that can be used alone or in combination with other medications for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , psoriasis , and ankylosing spondylitis . DB00065 , a chimeric humanized monoclonal antibody and adalimumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody are approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and moderate to severe Crohn 's disease . DB00065 is also approved for ulcerative colitis . Another anti-TNFalpha drug , certolizumab pegol , was declined approval as treatment option for active Crohn 's disease due to a lack of sufficient efficacy . Phase III studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients are still pending . It is the goal of this review article to summarize various therapeutic indications , underlying studies , safety , and use during pregnancy , as well as future directions for anti- P01375 therapies .
