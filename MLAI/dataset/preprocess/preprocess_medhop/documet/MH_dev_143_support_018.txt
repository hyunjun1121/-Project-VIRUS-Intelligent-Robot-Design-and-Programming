DB01645 stimulates electrogenic Cl(-) secretion in mouse jejunum . We used the short-circuit current ( I(sc) ) technique to investigate the effects of the isoflavone genistein on the electrogenic Cl(-) secretion of the mouse jejunum . DB01645 stimulated a sustained increase in I(sc) that was dose dependent . DB00887 inhibited 76 +/- 5 % of the genistein-stimulated I(sc) consistent with activation of Cl(-) secretion . DB01645 failed to stimulate I(sc) following maximal activation of the DB02527 pathway by forskolin . In addition , forskolin had a reduced effect on I(sc) of the mouse jejunum in the presence of genistein . DB01016 , a blocker of P13569 , eliminated the genistein-stimulated increase of I(sc) and reduced the forskolin-activated I(sc) . Clotrimazole , a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker , failed to reduce the genistein-stimulated I(sc) . Vanadate , a blocker of tyrosine-dependent phosphatases , reduced the genistein-activated I(sc) . Tyrphostin A23 , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , reduced basal I(sc) , after which genistein failed to stimulate I(sc) . These data suggest that genistein activated a sustained Cl(-) secretory response of the mouse jejunum and that the effect of genistein was via a tyrosine-dependent phosphorylation pathway .
