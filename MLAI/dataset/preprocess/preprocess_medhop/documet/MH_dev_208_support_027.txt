P04150 regulates DB00171 -binding cassette transporter-A1 expression and apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages . OBJECTIVE : The DB00171 -binding cassette transporter-A1 ( O95477 ) regulates cholesterol efflux from cells and is involved in high-density lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis . The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) and other glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) ligands on apolipoprotein AI-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages and O95477 expression in them . METHODS AND RESULTS : DB00514 , a GR agonist , decreased O95477 mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent fashion , and DB00834 , a GR antagonist , reversed the inhibitory effect of DB00514 . The effects of DB00514 and DB00834 on O95477 protein levels and apolipoprotein AI-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages were consistent with these changes in mRNA levels . Transfected RAW264.7 , together with a human O95477 promoter-luciferase construct , inhibited transcriptional activity by DB00514 and overexpression of human GR . Transrepression by GR was not mediated by liver X receptor ( LXR ) , because there were no differences in the effects of the GR ligands on promoter activity between a reporter construct with mutations at the LXR binding site and one without the mutations , and no changes were brought about in P45844 and Q9H172 expression by GR ligands . CONCLUSIONS : Our results showed that GR ligands affected O95477 expression and cholesterol efflux from macrophages , which are regulated by GR through a LXR-independent mechanism .
