Thymopentin down-regulates both activity and expression of P35228 in blood cells of Sézary syndrome patients . While thymopentin has been used for many years in the experimental treatment of Sézary syndrome ( SS ) , a rare and very aggressive lymphoma , its mechanism of action is still not known . Herein we show that this peptide acts as an inhibitor of isolated P35228 and P29475 isoforms , and reduces P35228 protein/mRNA levels and P35228 activity in blood cells obtained from both healthy donors and SS patients . Similar results were obtained with O15533 -2 , the N(ω)-nitro analogue of the DB00125 -Lys motif present in thymopentin . Additional investigations are necessary to confirm the role and the relative importance of the two mechanisms of P35228 down-regulation in the therapeutic action of these peptides against SS .
