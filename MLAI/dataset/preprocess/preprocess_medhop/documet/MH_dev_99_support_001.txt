P01308 deficiency exacerbates cerebral amyloidosis and behavioral deficits in an Alzheimer transgenic mouse model . BACKGROUND : Although increasing evidence has indicated that brain insulin dysfunction is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease ( AD ) , the underlying mechanisms by which insulin deficiency may impact the development of AD are still obscure . Using a streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -induced insulin deficient diabetic AD transgenic mouse model , we evaluated the effect of insulin deficiency on AD-like behavior and neuropathology . RESULTS : Our data showed that administration of Q11206 increased the level of blood glucose and reduced the level of serum insulin , and further decreased the phosphorylation levels of insulin receptors , and increased the activities of glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the P05067 / P49768 mouse brain . We further showed that Q11206 treatment promoted the processing of amyloid-β ( Aβ ) precursor protein resulting in increased Aβ generation , neuritic plaque formation , and spatial memory deficits in transgenic mice . CONCLUSIONS : Our present data indicate that there is a close link between insulin deficient diabetes and cerebral amyloidosis in the pathogenesis of AD .
