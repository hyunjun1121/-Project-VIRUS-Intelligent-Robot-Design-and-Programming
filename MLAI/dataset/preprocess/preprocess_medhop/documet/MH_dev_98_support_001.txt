Circulating hepatocyte growth factor as an independent prognostic factor of disseminated intravascular coagulation . BACKGROUND : P14210 ( P14210 ) , a pleiotropic factor regulating development and wound healing , is secreted as inactive pro- P14210 and is converted into active P14210 by coagulation serine proteases . P08581 overexpression can cause massive venous thrombi , and factor Xa is reported to release soluble P14210 from granulocytes . We hypothesized that a hypercoagulable condition , such as disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) , may increase circulating P14210 through active cleavage by coagulation serine proteases . METHODS : In 172 DIC-suspected patients , plasma levels of total and active P14210 , thrombin-antithrombin complex ( TAT ) , plasmin-antiplasmin complex ( PAP ) , and interleukin ( IL ) -6 were measured by ELISA . Active P14210 release in granulocytes was examined in patients with and without overt-DIC . P14210 -induced tissue factor expression in peripheral monocytes was measured by flow cytometry . RESULTS : Circulating levels of total and active P14210 correlated well with coagulopathy severity , including DIC score , D-dimer , TAT and PAP levels . P14210 positively correlated with P05231 and absolute neutrophil count . In contrast to the cancer group , P14210 levels were significantly increased in accordance with increased DIC scores in non-cancer group . Elevated circulating P14210 was an independent prognostic marker in the non-cancer group , while P14210 level failed to predict mortality in the cancer group . Amounts of P14210 released from stimulated granulocytes were not significantly different between overt-DIC and no overt-DIC patients . P14210 potentiated endotoxin-induced tissue factor expression of monocytes in vitro . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that circulating P14210 is a potential laboratory marker reflecting coagulation activity and DIC prognosis in non-cancer patients and that P14210 may play a role in a vicious cycle of hypercoagulability .
