Iodide- and glucose-handling gene expression regulated by sorafenib or cabozantinib in papillary thyroid cancer . CONTEXT : The aberrant silencing of iodide-handling genes accompanied by up-regulation of glucose metabolism presents a major challenge for radioiodine treatment of papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) . OBJECTIVE : This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on iodide-handling and glucose-handling gene expression in BHP 2-7 cells harboring P07949 / Q13635 rearrangement . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : In this in vitro study , the effects of sorafenib or cabozantinib on cell growth , cycles , and apoptosis were investigated by cell proliferation assay , cell cycle analysis , and P08758 -FITC apoptosis assay , respectively . The effect of both agents on signal transduction pathways was evaluated using the Western blot . Quantitative real-time PCR , Western blot , immunofluorescence , and radioisotope uptake assays were used to assess iodide-handling and glucose-handling gene expression . RESULTS : Both compounds inhibited cell proliferation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/ P55008 phase . DB00398 blocked P07949 , AKT , and P27361 /2 phosphorylation , whereas cabozantinib blocked P07949 and AKT phosphorylation . The restoration of iodide-handling gene expression and inhibition of glucose transporter 1 and 3 expression could be induced by either drug . The robust expression of sodium/iodide symporter induced by either agent was confirmed , and (125)I uptake was correspondingly enhanced . (18)F- DB09150 accumulation was significantly decreased after treatment by either sorafenib or cabozantinib . CONCLUSIONS : DB00398 and cabozantinib had marked effects on cell proliferation , cell cycle arrest , and signal transduction pathways in PTC cells harboring P07949 / Q13635 rearrangement . Both agents could be potentially used to enhance the expression of iodide-handling genes and inhibit the expression of glucose transporter genes .
