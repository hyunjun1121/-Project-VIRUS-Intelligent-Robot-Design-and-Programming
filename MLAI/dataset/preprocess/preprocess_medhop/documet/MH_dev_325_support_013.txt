Taurine biosynthesis in rat brain : a new specific and sensitive microassay of cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase ( CSDI ) activity through selective immunotrapping and its use for distribution studies . DB00151 sulfinate decarboxylase ( Q9Y600 ) , the putative biosynthetic enzyme for taurine , has been shown to exist in two forms in rat brain , respectively CSDI and CSDII , one of which ( CSDII ) is considered to be in fact glutamate decarboxylase ( Q99259 ) . CSDI assay after immunotrapping was made possible by using an anti- Q9Y600 antiserum raised in sheep immunized with a partially purified Q9Y600 fraction from liver . This antiserum immunoprecipitated both liver Q9Y600 and brain CSDI activities with the same affinity but did not inhibit their enzymatic activities . The immunotrapping of CSDI was selective without any contamination by Q99259 /CSDII activity . The immunotrapped Q9Y600 activity , which corresponded exactly to the amount of Q9Y600 not precipitated by a Q99259 /CSDII antiserum , was not inhibited by a specific irreversible Q99259 inhibitor . A quantitative , selective and sensitive assay was thus developed by measuring Q9Y600 activity on the solid phase after immunotrapping . Kinetic parameters of the immunotrapped enzyme remained unchanged . CSDI activity represented only a fraction , around 20 % with saturating concentration of substrate , of the total Q9Y600 activity in rat brain homogenate . This indicates that most studies on total Q9Y600 activity dealt essentially with CSDII activity that is indeed Q99259 . Regional and subcellular distributions of CSDI have been determined . CSDI activity was about threefold higher in the richest ( cerebellum ) compared to the poorest ( striatum ) region without any correlation with Q99259 /CSDII distribution . Subcellular distribution showed a fourfold enrichment of CSDI activity in the synaptosomal fraction . The precise role of CSDI and CSDII in the biosynthesis of taurine in vivo remains to be elucidated .
