P21453 as a useful target for treatment of multiple sclerosis . DB03203 1-phosphate ( Q14703 ) , a lysophospholipid mediator , is generated from sphingosine by sphingosine kinases and binds five known cell surface receptors . P21453 ( P21453 ) plays an essential role in lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs ( Q12791 ) , as evinced by the inability of lymphocytes to exit from the Q12791 in mice lacking lymphocytic P21453 . DB08868 hydrochloride ( FTY720 ) is a first-in-class , orally active , Q14703 receptor modulator with a structure closely related to sphingosine . FTY720 was first synthesized by chemical modification of a natural product , myriocin . FTY720 is effectively converted to an active metabolite , FTY720 phosphate ( FTY720-P ) by sphingosine kinases . FTY720-P shows high affinity to 4 of the Q14703 receptors ( P21453 , Q99500 , O95977 , and Q9H228 ) . In particular , FTY720-P strongly induces internalization and degradation of P21453 , inhibits Q14703 responsiveness of lymphocytes in the Q12791 , and acts as a functional antagonist at lymphocytic P21453 . Consequently , FTY720 inhibits P21453 -dependent lymphocyte egress from the Q12791 to decrease circulation of lymphocytes including autoreactive Th17 cells and is highly effective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , an animal model of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Because FTY720 shows a superior efficacy in relapsing remitting MS patients compared to intramuscular interferon-β-1a ( Avonex® ) , P21453 is presumed to be a useful target for the therapy of MS .
