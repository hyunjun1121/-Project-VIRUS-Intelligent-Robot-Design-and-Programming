Activation of the MyD88 signaling pathway inhibits ischemia-reperfusion injury in the small intestine . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) recognize microbial components and trigger the signaling cascade that activates innate and adaptive immunity . Recent studies have shown that the activation of TLR-dependent signaling pathways plays important roles in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injuries in many organs . All TLRs , except O15455 , use a common adaptor protein , MyD88 , to transduce activation signals . We investigated the role of MyD88 in I/R injury of the small intestine . MyD88 and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) knockout and wild-type mice were subjected to intestinal I/R injury . I/R-induced small intestinal injury was characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells , disruption of the mucosal epithelium , destruction of villi , and increases in myeloperoxidase activity and mRNA levels of P01375 -α and the P10145 homolog KC . MyD88 deficiency worsened the severity of I/R injury , as assessed using the histological grading system , measuring luminal contents of hemoglobin ( a marker of intestinal bleeding ) , and counting apoptotic epithelial cells , while it inhibited the increase in mRNA expression of P01375 -α and KC . I/R significantly enhanced P35354 expression and increased PGE(2) concentration in the small intestine of wild-type mice , which were markedly inhibited by MyD88 deficiency . P35354 knockout mice were also highly susceptible to intestinal I/R injury . Exogenous PGE(2) reduced the severity of injury in both MyD88 and P35354 knockout mice to the level of wild-type mice . These findings suggest that the MyD88 signaling pathway may inhibit I/R injury in the small intestine by inducing P35354 expression .
