A new 12-gene diagnostic biomarker signature of melanoma revealed by integrated microarray analysis . Genome-wide microarray technology has facilitated the systematic discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of cancers and other pathologies . However , meta-analyses of published arrays often uncover significant inconsistencies that hinder advances in clinical practice . Here we present an integrated microarray analysis framework , based on a genome-wide relative significance ( GWRS ) and genome-wide global significance ( GWGS ) model . When applied to five microarray datasets on melanoma published between 2000 and 2011 , this method revealed a new signature of 200 genes . When these were linked to so-called ' melanoma driver ' genes involved in MAPK , Ca(2+) , and WNT signaling pathways we were able to produce a new 12-gene diagnostic biomarker signature for melanoma ( i.e., P00533 , P21802 , P22607 , P10145 , P10586 , P24821 , O43927 , P12107 , O43745 , Q6S5L8 , Q9Y2T4 , and P56705 ) . We have begun to experimentally validate a subset of these genes involved in MAPK signaling at the protein level , including O43927 , P12107 , P10586 and Q6S5L8 and found these to be over-expressed in metastatic and primary melanoma cells in vitro and in situ compared to melanocytes cultured from healthy skin epidermis and normal healthy human skin . While Q6S5L8 has been reported previously to be associated to melanoma , this is the first time O43927 , P12107 , and P10586 have been associated with melanoma on experimental validation . Our computational evaluation indicates that this 12-gene biomarker signature achieves excellent diagnostic power in distinguishing metastatic melanoma from normal skin and benign nevus . Further experimental validation of the role of these 12 genes in a new signaling network may provide new insights into the underlying biological mechanisms driving the progression of melanoma .
