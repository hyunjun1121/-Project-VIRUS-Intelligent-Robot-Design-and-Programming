Implicating P21583 complexes in organogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans . Development of the Caenorhabditis elegans foregut ( pharynx ) is regulated by a network of proteins that includes the Retinoblastoma protein ( P06400 ) ortholog LIN-35 ; the ubiquitin pathway components P0CG48 -18 and Q9Y4X5 ; and PHA-1 , a cytoplasmic protein . Loss of pha-1 activity impairs pharyngeal development and body morphogenesis , leading to embryonic arrest . We have used a genetic suppressor approach to dissect this complex pathway . The lethality of pha-1 mutants is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in sup-35/ztf-21 and sup-37/ztf-12 , which encode Zn-finger proteins , and by mutations in sup-36 . Here we show that sup-36 encodes a divergent Skp1 family member that binds to several F-box proteins and the microtubule-associated protein Q02083 -1/Ï„ . Like P60880 -35 , P60880 -36 levels were negatively regulated by P0CG48 -18- Q9Y4X5 . We also found that P60880 -35 and P60880 -37 physically associated and that P60880 -35 could bind microtubules . Thus , P60880 -35 , P60880 -36 , and P60880 -37 may function within a pathway or complex that includes cytoskeletal components . Additionally , P60880 -36 may regulate the subcellular localization of P60880 -35 during embryogenesis . We carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify additional regulators of this network and identified 39 genes , most of which are associated with transcriptional regulation . Twenty-three of these genes acted via the LIN-35 pathway . In addition , several S-phase kinase-associated protein (Skp)1-Cullin-F-Box ( P21583 ) components were identified , further implicating P21583 complexes as part of the greater network controlling pharyngeal development .
