DB01076 attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via suppressing P35228 expression and the P29279 ( P29279 ) / P29323 signaling pathway . Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal lung disorder with high mortality rate . To date , despite the fact that extensive research trials are ongoing , pulmonary fibrosis continues to have a poor response to available medical therapy . Statins , P04035 inhibitors , known for its broad pharmacological activities , remains a remedy against multiple diseases . The present study investigated the antifibrotic potential of atorvastatin against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and to further explore the possible underlying mechanisms . Our results showed that atorvastatin administration significantly ameliorated the bleomycin mediated histological alterations and blocked collagen deposition with parallel reduction in the hydroxyproline level . DB01076 reduced malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level and lung indices . DB01076 also markedly decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) in lung tissues and , thus , prevented nitric oxide ( NO ) release in response to bleomycin challenge . Furthermore , atorvastatin exhibited target down-regulation of connective tissue growth factor ( P29279 ( P29279 ) ) and phosphorylation extracellular regulated protein kinases ( p- P29323 ) expression . Taken together , atorvastatin significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats , via the inhibition of P35228 expression and the P29279 ( P29279 ) / P29323 signaling pathway . The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin may be a potential therapeutic reagent for the treatment of lung fibrosis .
