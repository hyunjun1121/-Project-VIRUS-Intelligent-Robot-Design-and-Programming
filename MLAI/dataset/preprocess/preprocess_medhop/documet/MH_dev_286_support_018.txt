Ras-transfection up-regulated HaCaT cell migration : inhibition by Marimastat . Cell migration is an essential process in physiological and pathological conditions such as wound healing and tumor invasion . This phenomenon involves cell adhesion on the extracellular matrix mediated by integrins , and cell detachment promoted in part by metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . In the present study , the migration of two HaCaT-ras clones ( metastatic or not ) , was compared with HaCaT cells , and normal human primary cultured keratinocytes . Using colloidal gold migration assay , the migration index on type I and type IV collagen was similar for primary cultured keratinocytes and HaCaT , whereas it was markedly higher for the HaCaT-ras clones . High motility of ras-transfected cells was confirmed from an in vitro wound healing assay . It was not correlated with changes in integrin expression or related to a different adhesion on extracellular matrix . The Marismastat ( DB00786 ) , a MMP inhibitor , inhibited in a dose-dependent effect the migration in both assays , demonstrating the important role of MMPs in the migration process . Under our experimental conditions , P03956 activity was not detected in HaCaT and P14780 activity was secreted by these cells only after their stimulation by P01133 . Here , P08253 was the major gelatinolytic activity secreted by all the cells and its secretion was markedly higher for HaCaT-nis clones compared with HaCaT . In addition , Western blotting results confirmed a higher expression of P08253 associated with a lower expression of P16035 in HaCaT-ras compared with HaCaT . These results suggest that Ha-ras oncogene could be a stimulating factor of migration and might modified the balance between P08253 and P16035 in keratinocyte cell lines .
