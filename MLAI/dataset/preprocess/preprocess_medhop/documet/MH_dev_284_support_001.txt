Repeated cisplatin treatment can lead to a multiresistant tumor cell population with stem cell features and sensitivity to 3-bromopyruvate . DB00515 is used in treatment of several types of cancer , including epithelial ovarian carcinoma ( EOC ) . In order to mimic clinical treatment and to investigate longterm effects of cisplatin in surviving cancer cells , two EOC cell lines were repeatedly treated with low doses . In the SKOV-3 cell line originating from malignant ascites , but not in A2780 cells from a primary tumor , this led to emergence of a stable population ( SKOV-3-R ) which in the absence of cisplatin showed increased motility , epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and expression of cancer stem cell markers CD117 , P16070 and P00352 . Accordingly , the cells formed self-renewing spheres in serum-free stem cell medium . Despite upregulation of mitochondrial mass and cytochrome c , and no upregulation of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL , SKOV-3-R were multiresistant to antineoplastic drugs . Cancer stem cells , or tumor-initiating cells ( TICs ) are highly chemoresistant and are believed to cause relapse into disseminated and resistant EOC . Our second aim was therefore to target resistance in these Q8NDX1 -like cells . Resistance could be correlated with upregulation of hexokinase-II and P21796 , which are known to form a survival-promoting mitochondrial complex . The cells were thus sensitive to 3-bromopyruvate , which dissociates hexokinase-II from this complex , and were particularly sensitive to combination treatment with cisplatin at doses down to 0.1 x IC 50 . 3-bromopyruvate might thus be of use in targeting the especially aggressive Q8NDX1 populations .
