Dominant-positive Q00613 decreases alpha-synuclein level and alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity . P37840 aggregation and cytotoxicity are widely considered to play a critical role in the process of Parkinson 's disease . Heat shock proteins are a large family of cellular protective molecules in most kinds of cells . In this study , we examined the impact of dominant-positive heat shock transcription factor 1 ( Q00613 ) on alpha-synuclein over-expression cellular model of Parkinson 's disease . We found that over-expression of alpha-synuclein could form alpha-synuclein immunopositive inclusions and result in cell death ; dominant-positive Q00613 dramatically increased the expression of HSP70 in SH-SY5Y cells , and significantly decreased the level and cytotoxicity of alpha-synuclein . Taken together , these data indicate that dominant-positive Q00613 plays an important role in suppressing alpha-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells . Parkinson 's disease which is marked by alpha-synuclein aggregation may be treated by increasing a set of endogenous heat shock proteins .
