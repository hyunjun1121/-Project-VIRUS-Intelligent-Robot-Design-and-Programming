Analysis of polymorphism in renin angiotensin system and other related genes in South Indian chronic kidney disease patients . BACKGROUND : Several P00797 Angiotensin System ( DB01367 ) polymorphisms alter the homeostasis to an abnormal state . Similarly , other genes such as O60500 ( O60500 ) and Q9NP85 ( Q9NP85 ) contribute to the loss of renal function during renal diseases . In Indian population , studies in DB01367 and other renal specific gene polymorphisms in Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) patients are scanty . METHODS : We examined 118 CKD patients and 98 control subjects for the occurrence of common polymorphisms in angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion ( P12821 ; I/D ) , angiotensinogen ( AGT ; M235T ) , chymase ( CMA ; -1903G > A ) , angiotensin receptor type-1 ( P30556 -1166A > C ) , methylene DB00116 reductase ( P42898 ; 677C > T ) , nephrin ( O60500 ; R1160X ) and podocin ( Q9NP85 ; R291W and R229Q ) . RESULT : Significant association was observed in AGT-M235T polymorphism between CKD patients and controls . The frequency of TT genotype was higher in CKD patients when compared with controls ( 0.39 vs. 0.14 ; chi(2)=20.3 , P < 0.001 ) . P12821 -DD genotype showed a higher level of systolic pressure with a median of 166 mmHg ( P < 0.05 ) when compared to II and ID genotypes . Two heterozygous conditions of Q9NP85 -R229Q polymorphism were found among 105 CKD patients . No significant associations were found in genotype frequencies in other above polymorphisms between CKD patients and controls . CONCLUSION : Asian Indian population with AGT-TT genotypes may have a higher relative risk towards CKD with odds ratio ( OR ) 3.98 ( 95 % CI=1.92-8.25 ; P=0.0002 ) .
