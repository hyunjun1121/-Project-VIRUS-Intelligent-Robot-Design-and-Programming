Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in exudative age-related macular degeneration and diffuse diabetic macular edema . BACKGROUND : To evaluate the concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) in neovascular or edematous retinal diseases . METHODS : In the clinical comparative interventional study , P15692 and P09038 concentrations in aqueous humor samples of 35 patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , 21 patients with diabetic macular edema and 24 patients of a control group were measured using a solid-phase chemiluminescence immunoassay . RESULTS : Concentrations of P15692 and P09038 , respectively , were significantly higher in the diabetic group ( 184.7 +/- 107.0 and 5.0 +/- 10.2 pg/l ) than in the AMD group ( 107.7 +/- 73.0 pg/l , p = 0.002 ; 2.2 +/- 7.4 pg/l , p = 0.002 ) and the control group ( 71.5 +/- 94.7 pg/l , p = 0.001 ; 0.00 pg/l , p = 0.001 ) . The two latter groups did not vary significantly ( p = 0.10 ) . CONCLUSIONS : P15692 and P09038 are present in considerably higher concentrations in eyes with diabetic macular edema than in eyes with exudative AMD or normal eyes . The differences were more marked for P15692 than for P09038 .
