P13569 mediated chloride secretion in the avian renal proximal tubule . In primary cell cultures of the avian ( Gallus gallus ) renal proximal tubule parathyroid hormone and DB02527 activation generate a Cl(-)-dependent short circuit current ( I(SC) ) response , consistent with net transepithelial Cl(-) secretion . In this study we investigated the expression and physiological function of the Na-K-2Cl ( NKCC ) transporter and P13569 chloride channel , both associated with Cl(-) secretion in a variety of tissues , in these proximal tubule cells . Using both RT-PCR and immunoblotting approaches , we showed that NKCC and P13569 are expressed , both in proximal tubule primary cultures and in a proximal tubule fraction of non-cultured ( native tissue ) fragments . We also used electrophysiological methods to assess the functional contribution of NKCC and P13569 to forskolin-activated I(SC) responses in filter grown cultured monolayers . DB00887 ( 10 μM ) , a specific blocker of NKCC , inhibited forskolin activated I(SC) by about 40 % , suggesting that basolateral uptake of Cl(-) is partially mediated by NKCC transport . In monolayers permeabilized on the basolateral side with nystatin , forskolin activated an apical Cl(-) conductance , manifested as bidirectional diffusion currents in the presence of oppositely directed Cl(-) gradients . Under these conditions the apical conductance appeared to show some bias towards apical-to-basolateral Cl(-) current . Two selective P13569 blockers , P13569 Inhibitor 172 and GlyH-101 ( both at 20 μM ) inhibited the forskolin activated diffusion currents by 38-68 % , with GlyH-101 having a greater effect . These data support the conclusion that avian renal proximal tubules utilize an apical P13569 Cl(-) channel to mediate DB02527 -activated Cl(-) secretion .
