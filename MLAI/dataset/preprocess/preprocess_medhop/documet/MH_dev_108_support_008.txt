P01375 -alpha antagonists : differential clinical effects by different biotechnological molecules . Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have deeply changed the therapy of several inflammatory human diseases . For instance , clinical management of rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have profoundly benefited after the introduction of new therapeutic tools , such as antagonist of P01375 molecule . These drugs include etanercept , a soluble P01375 receptor antagonist , three anti- P01375 antibodies , adalimumab , infliximab , DB06674 and certolizumab a humanized Fab fragment combined with polyethylene glycol . These compounds efficiently inhibit several P01375 biological-mediated effects , however , they have also shown differential clinical efficacy in several trials from different autoimmune diseases . It is of clinical relevance that non-responders to one of these drugs often positively responded to another . Different mechanisms of action and diversity in pharmacokinetics of these three compounds may partially explain different clinical effects . However , partially diverse pathogenetic mechanisms in different diseases also contribute to differential therapeutic responses . Therefore , these apparently homogeneous agents can not be considered equivalent in their clinically efficacy . Differential therapeutic actions of these drugs may be advantageously used in clinical practice and further improve the great potential of individual P01375 inhibitors .
