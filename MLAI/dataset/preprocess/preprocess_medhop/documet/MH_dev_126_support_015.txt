Why the epidermal growth factor receptor ? The rationale for cancer therapy . There is a need for new , selective anticancer agents that differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant cells . The benefits of such agents would include a higher therapeutic index and lower toxicity than conventional therapies . Although expressed in nonmalignant cells , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is highly expressed in a variety of tumors , and its expression correlates with poor response to treatment , disease progression , and poor survival . Evidence for a role for the P00533 in the inhibition and pathogenesis of various cancers has led to the rational design and development of agents that selectively target this receptor . Activation of the P00533 signaling pathway in cancer cells has been linked with increased cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and metastasis , and decreased apoptosis . Preclinical data show that anti- P00533 therapies can inhibit these effects in vitro and in vivo . In addition , preclinical data confirm that many such agents have the potential to increase the effectiveness of current cytotoxic agents . Following accelerated drug development programs , phase III trials are now under way for a number of P00533 -targeted therapies , including the monoclonal antibody IMC-C225 and the P00533 -tyrosine kinase inhibitors ZD1839 ( DB00317 ) and DB00530 . Thus , the rationale for P00533 -targeted approaches to cancer treatment is apparent and now well established , and there is increasing evidence that they may represent a significant contribution to cancer therapy .
