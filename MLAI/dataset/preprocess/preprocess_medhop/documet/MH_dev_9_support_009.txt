Rat peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and brown adipose tissue function during cold acclimatization . Brown adipose tissue ( Q14032 ) hyperplasia is a fundamental physiological response to cold ; it involves an acute phase of mitotic cell growth followed by a prolonged differentiation phase . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation and may therefore mediate important metabolic changes during non-shivering thermogenesis . In the present study we have investigated Q07869 mRNA expression in relation to peroxisome proliferation in rat Q14032 during cold acclimatization . By immunoelectron microscopy we show that the number of peroxisomes per cytoplasmic volume and acyl- DB01992 oxidase immunolabeling density remained constant ( thus increasing in parallel with tissue mass and cell number ) during the initial proliferative phase and the acute thermogenic response but increased after 14 days of cold exposure , correlating with terminal differentiation of Q14032 . A pronounced decrease in Q14032 PPARalpha and PPARgamma mRNA levels was found within hours of exposure to cold , which was reversed after 14 days , suggesting a role for either or both of these subtypes in the proliferation and induction of peroxisomes and peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes . In contrast , PPARdelta mRNA levels increased progressively during cold exposure . Transactivation assays in HIB 1B and P29320 -293 cells demonstrated an adrenergic stimulation of peroxisome proliferator response element reporter activity via Q07869 , establishing a role for these nuclear receptors in hormonal regulation of gene transcription in Q14032 .
