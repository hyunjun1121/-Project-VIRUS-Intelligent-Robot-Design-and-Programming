Case reports of heart failure after therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist . BACKGROUND : DB00005 and infliximab are U.S . Food and Drug Administration-approved tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) antagonists . OBJECTIVE : To describe adverse event reports of heart failure after P01375 antagonist therapy . DESIGN : Case series . SETTING : The U.S . Food and Drug Administration 's MedWatch program . PATIENTS : 47 patients who developed new or worsening heart failure during P01375 antagonist therapy . MEASUREMENTS : Clinical and laboratory reports . RESULTS : After P01375 antagonist therapy , 38 patients developed new-onset heart failure and 9 patients experienced heart failure exacerbation . Of the 38 patients with new-onset heart failure , 19 ( 50 % ) had no identifiable risk factors . Ten patients younger than 50 years of age developed new-onset heart failure after receiving P01375 antagonists . After P01375 antagonist therapy was discontinued and heart failure therapy was started in these 10 patients , 3 had complete resolution of heart failure , 6 improved , and 1 died . CONCLUSION : In a fraction of patients , P01375 antagonists might induce new-onset heart failure or exacerbate existing disease .
