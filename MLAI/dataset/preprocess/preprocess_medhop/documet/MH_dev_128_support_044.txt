P13569 in a lipid raft- P19438 complex modulates gap junctional intercellular communication and P10145 secretion . Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) cause a chronic inflammatory response in the lung of patients with Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . We have showed that P01375 signaling through the Src family tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) was defective as determined by an inability of P01375 to regulate gap junctional communication ( GJIC ) in CF cells . Here , we sought to elucidate the mechanisms linking P01375 signaling to the functions of P13569 at the molecular level . In a MDCKI epithelial cell model expressing wild-type ( WtCFTR ) or mutant P13569 lacking its PDZ-interacting motif ( P13569 -DeltaTRL ) , P01375 increased the amount of WtCFTR but not P13569 -DeltaTRL in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains ( DRMs ) . This recruitment was modulated by SFK activity and associated with O60565 localization of P19438 and c-Src . Activation of P19438 signaling also decreased GJIC and markedly stimulated P10145 production in WtCFTR cells . In contrast , the absence of P13569 in DRMs was associated with abnormal P19438 signaling as revealed by no recruitment of P19438 and c-Src to lipid rafts in P13569 -DeltaTRL cells and loss of regulation of GJIC and P10145 secretion . These results suggest that localization of P13569 in lipid rafts in association with c-Src and P19438 provides a responsive signaling complex to regulate GJIC and cytokine signaling .
