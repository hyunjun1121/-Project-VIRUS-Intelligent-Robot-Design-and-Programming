P10275 is the key transcriptional mediator of the tumor suppressor O43791 in prostate cancer . Somatic missense mutations in the substrate-binding pocket of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor O43791 are present in up to 15 % of human prostate adenocarcinomas , but are rare in other malignancies , suggesting a prostate-specific mechanism of action . O43791 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of several protein substrates , including the androgen receptor ( AR ) coactivator Q9Y6Q9 . However , the relative contributions that O43791 substrates may make to the pathophysiology of O43791 -mutant ( mt ) prostate adenocarcinomas are unknown . Using an unbiased bioinformatics approach , we determined that the gene expression profile of prostate adenocarcinoma cells engineered to express mt- O43791 overlaps greatly with the gene signature of both Q9Y6Q9 and AR transcriptional output , with a stronger similarity to AR than Q9Y6Q9 . This finding suggests that in addition to its Q9Y6Q9 -mediated effects , O43791 also exerts Q9Y6Q9 -independent effects that are AR-mediated . Indeed , we found that wild-type ( wt ) but not prostate adenocarcinoma-associated mutants of O43791 promoted AR ubiquitination and degradation , acting directly through a O43791 -binding motif in the hinge region of AR . In support of these results , tumor xenografts composed of prostate adenocarcinoma cells expressing mt- O43791 exhibited higher AR protein levels and grew faster than tumors composed of prostate adenocarcinoma cells expressing wt- O43791 . Furthermore , genetic ablation of O43791 was sufficient to increase AR protein levels in mouse prostate . Examination of public human prostate adenocarcinoma datasets confirmed a strong link between transcriptomic profiles of mt- O43791 and AR . Overall , our studies highlight the AR axis as the key transcriptional output of O43791 in prostate adenocarcinoma and provide an explanation for the prostate-specific tumor suppressor role of wt- O43791 .
