DB00205 resistant Plasmodium falciparum : overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase by a gene duplication . The accumulation of [3H]pyrimethamine by pyrimethamine-resistant ( Pyrr ) mutants of the Plasmodium falciparum strain FCR3 was examined by measuring the accumulation of drug in infected red blood cells . [3H] DB00205 was stage specifically accumulated in trophozoites and schizont infected red blood cells . The mutant parasites accumulated drug as efficiently as FCR3 . DB00205 was associated with a high molecular weight protein that eluted from a Sephadex G200 column exactly as [3H]fluorodeoxyuridinemonophosphate ( FdUMP ) labeled parasite dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase ( P00374 -TS ) enzyme . These results suggested that the pyrimethamine resistance was not associated with decreased drug permeability of the membrane . P00374 -TS-[3H]FdUMP enzyme complex of all the Pyrr mutants and FCR3 had a monomer of 70 kDa as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . One highly resistant mutant , FCR3-D7 , exhibited a 5-10 fold higher uptake of pyrimethamine and a proportionately higher amount of P00374 -TS protein than FCR3 but only a normal level of P00374 activity . The genomic DNA of FCR3-D7 was shown to contain at least twice as much P00374 -TS specific DNA than either FCR3- P41226 , another Pyrr mutant , or FCR3 . Preliminary results suggested some of the P00374 -TS genetic material in FCR3-D7 is associated with a gene duplication .
