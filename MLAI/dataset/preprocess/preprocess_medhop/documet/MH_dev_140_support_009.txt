Pleiotropic stromal effects of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antibody therapy in renal cell carcinoma models . The benefits of inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) signaling in cancer patients are predominantly attributed to effects on tumor endothelial cells . Targeting non-endothelial stromal cells to further impact tumor cell growth and survival is being pursued through the inhibition of additional growth factor pathways important for the survival and/or proliferation of these cells . However , recent data suggest that P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) -specific inhibitors may target lymphatic vessels and pericytes in addition to blood vessels . Here , in fact , we demonstrate that DC101 ( 40 mg/kg , thrice a week ) , an antibody specific to murine P35968 , significantly reduces all three of these stromal components in subcutaneous ( SKRC-29 ) and orthotopic ( 786-O-LP ) models of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) established in nu/nu athymic mice . DB01268 ( 40 mg/kg , once daily ) , a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of P35968 and other growth factor receptors , also caused significant loss of tumor blood vessels in RCC models but had weaker effects than DC101 on pericytes and lymphatic vessels . In combination , sunitinib did not significantly add to the effects of DC101 on tumor blood vessels , lymphatic vessels , or pericytes . Nevertheless , sunitinib increased the effect of DC101 on tumor burden in the SKRC-29 model , perhaps related to its broader specificity . Our data have important implications for combination therapy design , supporting the conclusion that targeting P35968 alone in RCC has the potential to have pleiotropic effects on tumor stroma .
