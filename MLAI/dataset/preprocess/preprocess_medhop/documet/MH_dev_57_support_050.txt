Farnesoid X receptor responds to bile acids and represses cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene ( P22680 ) transcription . DB04540 7alpha-hydroxylase gene ( P22680 ) transcription is repressed by bile acids . The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of P22680 transcription by bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) in its native promoter and cellular context and to identify Q96RI1 response elements in the gene . In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with retinoid X receptor alpha ( RXRalpha ) / Q96RI1 , only chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) and deoxycholic acid ( DB08809 ) were able to stimulate a heterologous promoter/reporter containing an ecdysone response element . In HepG2 cells , all bile acids ( 25 microM ) were able to repress P22680 /luciferase reporter activity , and only DB06777 and DB08809 further repressed reporter activity when cotransfected with RXRalpha/ Q96RI1 . The concentration of DB06777 required to inhibit 50 % of reporter activity ( IC(50) ) was determined to be approximately 25 microM without Q96RI1 and 10 microM with Q96RI1 . Deletion analysis revealed that the bile acid response element located between nucleotides -148 and -128 was the Q96RI1 response element , but RXRalpha/ Q96RI1 did not bind to this sequence . These results suggest that bile acid-activated Q96RI1 exerts its inhibitory effect on P22680 transcription by an indirect mechanism , in contrast to the stimulation and binding of Q96RI1 to intestinal bile acid-binding protein gene promoter . Results also reveal that bile acid receptors other than Q96RI1 are present in HepG2 cells .
