Toll-like receptor expression in human keratinocytes : nuclear factor kappaB controlled gene activation by Staphylococcus aureus is toll-like receptor 2 but not toll-like receptor 4 or platelet activating factor receptor dependent . Cultured primary human keratinocytes were screened for their expression of various members of the toll-like receptor ( TLR ) family . Keratinocytes were found to constitutively express Q15399 , O60603 , O15455 , O60602 , and Q9NR96 but not O00206 , Q9Y2C9 , Q9NYK1 , Q9NR97 , or Q9BXR5 as shown by polymerase chain reaction analysis . The expression of the crucial receptor for signaling of staphylococcal compounds O60603 was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry , in contrast to O00206 , which showed a negative staining pattern . Next , we analyzed the activation of the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor kappaB by Staphylococcus aureus strain 8325-4 . Using nuclear extract gel shifts , RelA staining , and luciferase reporter transfection plasmids we found a clear induction of nuclear factor kappaB translocation by the bacteria . This translocation induced the transcription of nuclear factor kappaB controlled genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthetase , P35354 , and interleukin-8 . Transcription of these genes was followed by production of increased amounts of interleukin-8 protein and NO . Inhibition experiments using monoclonal antibodies and the specific platelet activating factor receptor inhibitor CV3988 showed that nuclear factor kappaB activation by S. aureus was O60603 but not O00206 or platelet activating factor receptor dependent . In line , the purified staphylococcal cell wall components lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan , known to signal through O60603 , also showed nuclear factor kappaB translocation in human keratinocytes , indicating a crucial role of the staphylococcal cell wall in the innate immune stimulation of human keratinocytes . These results help to explain the complex activation of human keratinocytes by S. aureus and its cell wall components in various inflammatory disorders of the skin .
