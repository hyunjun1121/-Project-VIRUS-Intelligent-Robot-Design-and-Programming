[ Gene polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor , vitamin D-binding protein and calcium-sensing receptor in respect of calcium-phosphate disturbances in chronic dialysis patients ] . Dialysed patients suffering from chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) show varied levels of concentration of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in the blood . One of the factors in charge of regulating levels of PTH concentration is DB00136 [ 1,25-(OH)2D3 ] . Its deficiency in advanced stages of CKD is common . Vitamin D supplementation is not always effective in reaching levels of PTH concentration recommended by KDIGO for the dialysed patients . That suggests , among other things , disturbances in 1,25-(OH)2D3 , reaching its place of target effect and having the desired final result . Disturbances of vitamin D target pathway can be genetically conditioned , hence the aim of this paper is to describe the distribution of polymorphic variants of vitamin D-binding protein gene ( VDBP ) , vitamin D receptor gene ( P11473 ) and gene of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) with respect to PTH concentrations in serum and response to cinacalcet treatment in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in view of the differences in demographical , clinical and laboratory data of the dialysed patients .
