Agonist-promoted down-regulation and functional desensitization in two naturally occurring variants of the human serotonin1A receptor . We recently reported two naturally occurring polymorphisms of the human serotonin1A ( P08908 ) receptor : glycine22 --> serine ( Ser22 ) and isoleucine28 --> valine ( Val28 ) in the putative aminoterminal domain of the receptor . To investigate the regulatory properties of these variants , the wild type ( WT ) and variant P08908 receptors were stably expressed in CHO- P04264 cells . WT , Ser22 , and Val28 displayed similar high-affinity binding to [ 3H ] -8-OH-DPAT . Competition experiments with P08908 agonists and antagonists demonstrated similar pharmacological profiles . Receptor agonist-promoted down-regulation was tested by exposure to 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT . After 24-h exposure , WT and Val28 underwent 59.3 +/- 3.9 % and 59.5 +/- 1.4 % reduction in receptor density respectively , whereas the degree of down-regulation was significantly lower for Ser22 ( 21.4 +/- 4.2 % ) . Cell treatment for 24 h with 100 mumol/L 8-OH-DPAT reduced the 5-HT-induced inhibition of DB02527 accumulation by 24.9 +/- 5.1 % for WT and 16.4 +/- 0.8 % for Val28 , but only by 4.8 +/- 3 % for Ser22 . We conclude that the Ser22 variant is capable of attenuating agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation and desensitization .
