Quality of life in plaque psoriasis patients treated with voclosporin : a Canadian phase III , randomized , multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . BACKGROUND : Quality of life assessments are important in the evaluation of new therapies for psoriasis . OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of voclosporin ( VCS ) treatment on quality of life in patients with psoriasis . PATIENTS AND METHODS : 451 plaque psoriasis patients with â‰¥ 10 % body surface area involvement were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 4 treatment groups ( placebo , VCS 0.2 mg kg(-1) P55957 , VCS 0.3 mg kg(-1) P55957 , and VCS 0.4 mg kg(-1) P55957 ) for up to 12 weeks of treatment . Quality of life was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) and the Psoriasis Disability Index ( P07237 ) . RESULTS : At 12 weeks , patients treated with VCS 0.4 mg kg(-1) P55957 had statistically significantly more favourable assessments than placebo-treated patients in all domains of the DLQI and the P07237 . Patients treated with VCS 0.3 mg kg(-1) P55957 had statistically significant improvements in 5 of 10 domains of the DLQI and all domains of the P07237 . Patients treated with VCS 0.2 mg kg(-1) P55957 had statistically significant improvements in 4 of 10 domains of the DLQI and 2 of 4 domains of the P07237 . CONCLUSION : Treatment with VCS 0.4 mg kg(-1) P55957 significantly improves the quality of life of patients with psoriasis .
