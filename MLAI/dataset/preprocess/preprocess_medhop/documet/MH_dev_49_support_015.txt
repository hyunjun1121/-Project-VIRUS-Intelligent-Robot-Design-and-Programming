Steady-state kinetic and inhibition studies of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) kinase domain and P42345 complexes . The mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) is a DB00133 / DB00156 protein kinase and a major controller of cell growth . In cells , P42345 forms two distinct multiprotein complexes , mTORC1 and mTORC2 . The mTORC1 complex can phosphorylate 4EBP1 and P23443 , two key regulators of translation initiation , whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates P31749 , an event required for P31749 activation . Here , we expressed and purified human mTORC1 and mTORC2 from P29320 -293 cells using FLAG-M2 affinity chromatography . Western blotting analysis using phospho-specific antibodies indicated that recombinant mTORC1 and mTORC2 exhibit distinct substrate preferences in vitro , consistent with their roles in cells . To improve our understanding of the enzymatic properties of P42345 alone and P42345 in its complex form , steady-state kinetic profiles of truncated P42345 containing the kinase domain ( residues 1360-2549 ) and mTORC1 were determined . The results revealed that mTORC1 is catalytically less active than truncated P42345 , as evidenced by 4.7- and 3.1-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency , k(cat)/K(m) , for DB00171 and 4EBP1 , respectively . We also found that truncated P42345 undergoes autophosphorylation through an intramolecular mechanism . Mass spectrometric analysis identified two novel P42345 autophosphorylation sites , Ser2454 and either Thr2473 or Thr2474 , in addition to the previously reported Ser2481 site . Truncated P42345 and mTORC1 were completely inhibited by DB00171 competitive inhibitors PI103 and BEZ235 and partially inhibited by rapamycin/ P62942 in a noncompetitive fashion toward DB00171 . All inhibitors tested exhibited similar inhibitory potencies between mTORC1 and truncated P42345 containing the kinase domain . Our studies presented here provide the first detailed kinetic studies of a recombinant P42345 complex .
