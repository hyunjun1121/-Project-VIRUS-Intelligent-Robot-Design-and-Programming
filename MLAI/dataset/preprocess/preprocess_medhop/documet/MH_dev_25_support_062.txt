The macrophage mannose receptor induces Q16552 in response to Candida albicans . The cytokine Q16552 controls neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses . The pattern recognition receptor(s) that induce Th17 responses during infection , in the absence of artificial mitogenic stimulation with anti-CD3/anti- P10747 antibodies , remain obscure . We investigated the innate immune receptors and pathogen-associated molecular patterns involved in triggering Th17 responses during pathogen-specific host defense . The prototypic fungal pathogen Candida albicans was found to induce Q16552 more potently than Gram-negative bacteria . Candida mannan , but not zymosan , beta-glucans , Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonists , or the Q9HC29 ligand P16444 , induced Q16552 production in the absence of anti-CD3/anti- P10747 antibodies . Candida-induced Q16552 response was dependent on antigen-presenting cells and the macrophage mannose receptor ( MR ) , demonstrating that Candida mannan is not simply a mitogenic stimulus . The O60603 /dectin-1 pathway , but not O00206 or Q9HC29 , amplified MR-induced Q16552 production . This study identifies the specific pattern recognition receptors that trigger the Th17 response induced by a human pathogen in the absence of mitogenic stimulation .
