DB00013 and its receptors in chronic kidney disease . This review focuses on the role of the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its high affinity receptor Q03405 /CD87 in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progression . An emerging theme is their organ- and site-specific effects . In addition to tubules , uPA is produced by macrophages and fibroblasts in CKD . By activating hepatocyte growth factor and degrading fibrinogen uPA may have anti-fibrotic effects . However renal fibrosis was similar between uPA wild-type and knockout mice in experimental CKD . The Q03405 is expressed by renal parenchymal cells and inflammatory cells in a variety of kidney diseases . Such expression appears anti-fibrotic based on studies in Q03405 -deficient mice . In CKD Q03405 expression is associated with higher uPA activity but its most important effect appears to be due to effects on cell recruitment and migration that involve interactions with a variety of co-receptors and chemoattractant effects of soluble Q03405 . P04004 and high molecular weight kininogen are alternate Q03405 ligands , and receptors in addition to Q03405 may also bind directly to uPA and activate cell signaling pathways .
