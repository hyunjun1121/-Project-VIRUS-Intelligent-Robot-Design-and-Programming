Ex vivo expansion and long-term hematopoietic reconstitution ability of sorted P28906 + P13987 + cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . Autologous bone marrow transplantation ( ABMT ) for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) remains difficult so far . To expand residual normal P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells isolated from patients with PNH and observe the long-term hematopoietic reconstruction ability of the expanded cells both ex vivo and in vivo , P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells from 13 PNH patients and P28906 (+) cells from 11 normal controls were separated from bone marrow mononuclear cells first by immunomagnetic microbeads and then by flow cytometry autoclone sorting . The cells were then cultivated under different conditions . The long-term hematopoietic supporting ability of expanded P28906 (+) P13987 (+) cells was evaluated by long-term culture in semi-solid medium in vitro and long-term engraftment in irradiated severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice in vivo . The best combination of hematopoietic growth factors for ex vivo expansion was P21583 + P08700 + P05231 + FL + Tpo + Epo . The most suitable time for harvest was on day 7 . P28906 (+) P13987 (+) PNH cells retained strong colony-forming capacity even after expansion . The survival rate , complete blood cell count recovery on day 90 , and human P08575 expression in different organs were similar between the irradiated SCID mice transplanted with expanded P28906 (+) P13987 (+) PNH cells and those with normal P28906 (+) cells ( P > 0.05 ) both in primary and secondary transplantation . These data provided a new potential way of managing PNH with ABMT .
