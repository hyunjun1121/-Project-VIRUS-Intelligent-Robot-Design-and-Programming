Serum-free differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into alveolar type II epithelial cells . Alveolar type II ( P50052 ) epithelial cells have important functions including the production of surfactant and regeneration of lost alveolar type I epithelial cells . The ability of in vitro production of P50052 cells would offer new therapeutic options in treating pulmonary injuries and disorders including genetically based surfactant deficiencies . Aiming at the generation of P50052 -like cells , the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) toward mesendodermal progenitors ( MEPs ) was optimized using a " Brachyury-eGFP-knock in " mESC line . eGFP expression demonstrated generation of up to 65 % MEPs at day 4 after formation of embryoid bodies ( EBs ) under serum-free conditions . Plated EBs were further differentiated into P50052 -like cells for a total of 25 days in serum-free media resulting in the expression of endodermal marker genes ( FoxA2 , Sox17 , P02766 , Q15669 -1 ) and of markers for distal lung epithelium ( surfactant proteins ( SP- ) A , B , C , and D , P11684 , aquaporin 5 ) . Notably , expression of P11686 as the only known P50052 cell specific marker could be detected after serum-induction as well as under serum-free conditions . Cytoplasmic localization of P11686 was demonstrated by confocal microscopy . The presence of P50052 -like cells was confirmed by electron microscopy providing evidence for polarized cells with apical microvilli and lamellar body-like structures . Our results demonstrate the differentiation of P50052 -like cells from mESCs after serum-induction and under serum-free conditions . The established serum-free differentiation protocol will facilitate the identification of key differentiation factors leading to a more specific and effective generation of P50052 -like cells from ESCs .
