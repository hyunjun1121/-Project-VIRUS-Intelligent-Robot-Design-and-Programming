Clinical significance of arginase after liver transplantation . Liver graft function after transplantation is dependent on ischemia-reperfusion injury , toxicity of drugs ( immunosuppression , antibiotics and other ) and transplant rejection . Although routinely monitored with enzymatic tests ( Q9NRA2 , ALT , P19440 , ALP ) , bilirubin and coagulation parameters , differentiation between these pathologies is hardly possible without liver biopsy . Arginase ( 3.5.3.1 ) mostly exists in the liver and in trace amounts in extra-hepatic tissue . Thus , we hypothesized that activity of arginase could be a more specific test of liver function . Sera of 32 liver transplant recipients were tested for Q9NRA2 , ALT , P01008 , bilirubin and arginase . Samples were obtained daily in first 2 weeks after LTx and weekly afterwards . Correlation of arginase activity with other liver function markers was calculated . Serum arginase peaked at day 1 post LTx ( mean 64,6+/-91 IU/L ) , and decreased more rapidly than other tests if good liver function was observed . The values showed strong and significant correlation with Q9NRA2 and ALT activities ( Pearsons R 0,65 and 0,47 respectively ) . We conclude that activity of arginase in the serum is an exact test of liver function .
