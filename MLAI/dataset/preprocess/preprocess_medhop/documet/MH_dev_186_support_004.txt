Combination of rapamycin and protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitors for the treatment of leukemias caused by oncogenic PTKs . Abnormal protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) cause many human leukemias . For example , P11274 / P00519 causes chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , whereas P36888 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia . The P00519 inhibitor Imatinib ( Gleevec , STI571 ) has remarkable efficacy for treating chronic phase CML , and P36888 inhibitors ( e.g. , PKC412 ) show similar promise in preclinical studies . However , resistance to PTK inhibitors is a major emerging problem that may limit long-term therapeutic efficacy . Development of rational combination therapies will probably be required to effect cures of these and other neoplastic disorders . Here , we report that the P42345 inhibitor rapamycin synergizes with Imatinib against P11274 / P00519 -transformed myeloid and lymphoid cells and increases survival in a murine CML model . DB00877 /Imatinib combinations also inhibit Imatinib-resistant mutants of P11274 / P00519 , and rapamycin plus PKC412 synergistically inhibits cells expressing PKC412-sensitive or -resistant leukemogenic P36888 mutants . Biochemical analyses raise the possibility that inhibition of Q13541 phosphorylation may be particularly important for the synergistic effects of PTK inhibitor/rapamycin combinations . Addition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor to rapamycin or rapamycin plus PTK inhibitor further increases efficacy . Our results suggest that simultaneous targeting of more than one signaling pathway required by leukemogenic PTKs may improve the treatment of primary and relapsed CML and/or acute myelogenous leukemia caused by P36888 mutations . Similar strategies may be useful for treating solid tumors associated with mutant and/or overexpressed PTKs .
