Multiple endocytic signals in the C-terminal tail of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator . The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is a DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) -activated chloride channel that is localized to the plasma membrane and endosomal compartment . Endosomal targeting of P13569 is attributed to the DB00135 (1424)-based internalization signal , identified in the C-terminal tail of the channel . Mutation of the DB00135 (1424) residue could partly inhibit the endocytosis of P13569 and its association with the adapter protein P05549 . To reveal additional endosomal targeting signals , site-directed mutagenesis of both a chimaera , composed of a truncated form of interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain ( TacT ) and the C-terminal tail of P13569 ( Ct ) , and the full-length P13569 was performed . Morphological and functional assays revealed the presence of multiple internalization motifs at the C-terminus , consisting of a phenylalanine-based motif ( DB00120 (1413) ) and a bipartite endocytic signal , comprising a tyrosine ( DB00135 (1424) ) and a di- DB00149 -based ( DB00149 (1430)- DB00149 ) motif . Whereas the replacement of any one of the three internalization motifs with alanine prevented the endocytosis of the TacT-Ct chimaera , mutagenesis of DB00120 (1413)- DB00149 impaired the biosynthetic processing of P13569 , indicating that DB00120 (1413) is indispensable for the native structure of P13569 . In contrast , replacement of DB00149 (1430)- DB00149 - and DB00135 (1424)-based signals with alanine increased the cell-surface density of both the chimaeras and P13569 in an additive manner . These results suggest that the internalization of P13569 is regulated by multiple endocytic sorting signals .
