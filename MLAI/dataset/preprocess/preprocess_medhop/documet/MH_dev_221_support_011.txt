Biosynthesis of spermidine , a direct precursor of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in root cultures of Senecio vulgaris L . The polyamine spermidine is an essential biosynthetic precursor of pyrrolizidine alkaloids . It provides its aminobutyl group which is transferred to putrescine yielding homospermidine , the specific building block of the necine base moiety of pyrrolizidine alkaloids . The enzymatic formation of spermidine was studied in relation to the unique role of this polyamine as an alkaloid precursor . S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ( P17707 , EC 4.1.1.50 ) and spermidine synthase ( SPDS , EC 2.5.1.16 ) from root cultures of Senecio vulgaris were partially purified and characterized . The P17707 -catalyzed reaction showed a pH optimum of 7.5 , that of SPDS an optimum of 7.7 . The Km value of P17707 for its substrate S-adenosylmethionine ( DB00118 ) was 15 microM , while the apparent Km values of SPDS for its substrates decarboxylated DB00118 ( dSAM ) and putrescine were 4 microM and 21 microM , respectively . The relative molecular masses of the two enzymes , determined by gel filtration , were 29000 ( P17707 ) and 37000 ( SPDS ) . Studies with various potential inhibitors revealed , for most inhibitors , profiles that were similar to those established with the respective enzymes from other plant sources . However , putrescine which is not known to be an inhibitor of plant P17707 , strongly inhibited the enzyme from S. vulgaris roots . P19623 was sensitive to inhibition by its product spermidine . In the presence of the stationary tissue concentrations of the two polyamines ( ca. 0.1 mM each ) the activities of P17707 and SPDS would be inhibited by > 80 % . The results are discussed in relation to the role of spermidine in primary and secondary metabolism of alkaloid-producing S. vulgaris root cultures .
