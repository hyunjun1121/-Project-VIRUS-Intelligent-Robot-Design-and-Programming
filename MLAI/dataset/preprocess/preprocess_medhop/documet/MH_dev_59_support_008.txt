Histone deacetylase-2 and airway disease . The increased expression of inflammatory genes in inflammatory lung diseases is regulated by acetylation of core histones , whereas histone deacetylase-2 ( Q92769 ) suppresses inflammatory gene expression . Corticosteroids suppress inflammatory genes in asthma by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase and in particular by recruiting Q92769 to the nuclear factor-kappaB-activated inflammatory gene complex . This involves deacetylation of the acetylated glucocorticoid receptor . In P48444 , severe asthma and asthmatics who smoke , Q92769 is reduced , thus preventing corticosteroids from suppressing inflammation . The reduction in Q92769 appears to be secondary to increased oxidative and nitrative stress in the lungs . Antioxidants and inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis may therefore restore corticosteroid sensitivity in P48444 , but this can also be achieved by low concentrations of theophylline and curcumin , which act as HDAC activators . DB00277 is a direct inhibitor of oxidant-activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase-delta , which is involved in inactivation of Q92769 . In the future selective O00329 inhibitors and more direct activators of Q92769 may be used to treat corticosteroid-resistant inflammatory diseases of the lung , including P48444 , severe asthma and asthma in smokers .
