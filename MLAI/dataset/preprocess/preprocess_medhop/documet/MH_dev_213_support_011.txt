Production of prostaglandins in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana . Plants do not naturally produce the very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are the precursors of prostaglandins , but in previous studies Arabidopsis thaliana had been transformed sequentially with genes encoding a Δ(9)-elongase and a Δ(8)-desaturase to produce dihomo-γ-linolenic acid ( DB00154 ) and eicosatetraenoic acid ( P25101 ) , and subsequently with a gene encoding a Δ(5)-desaturase to produce arachidonic acid ( AA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) . Transformation of A. thaliana with the first two genes consolidated on a single binary vector yielded transformants producing high levels of DB00154 , and these plants were further transformed with mouse prostaglandin H synthase ( PGH ) genes to produce prostaglandins . Mouse P23219 and P35354 cDNAs were amplified for expression as three isoforms : P23219 ( complete coding sequence with signal peptide ) , P23219 -Ma ( mature P23219 sequence , without signal peptide ) and P35354 ( complete coding sequence with signal peptide ) . P23219 transformants showed the highest activity , followed by P35354 transformants , whereas removal of the signal peptide resulted in almost complete loss of P23219 activity . In order to produce a physiologically active prostaglandin , the Trypanosoma brucei prostaglandin F synthase gene was combined with the mouse P23219 gene and the Mortierella alpina Δ(5)-desaturase on a binary vector . Transformation of DB00154 -producing A. thaliana with this construct yielded transformants that successfully produced prostaglandin F .
