Accelerated and long-term hematopoietic engraftment in mice transplanted with ex vivo expanded bone marrow . Using a murine experimental model , we investigated whether ex vivo expansion of BM grafts under P08700 / P05231 stimulation accelerates the early hematopoietic recovery of recipients of BM transplants . To facilitate the ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic progenitors , BM was first enriched in proliferatively active hematopoietic stem cells by a single treatment with 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) 4 days prior to the BM harvest . The results showed that the number of CFU-GM and CFU- P28222 progenitors in the graft was significantly increased ( 56-fold and 14-fold , respectively ) , as a result of a 3 day incubation in the presence of P08700 and P05231 . Daily analysis of animals transplanted with 5 x 10(4) BM cells , either freshly harvested or expanded for 3 days , showed that the expanded grafts consistently allowed a faster hematopoietic recovery of recipients . Differences between both groups of transplanted animals were most evident when the number of either femoral or splenic CFU-GMs were compared , with increases close to 70-fold at the fifth day of engraftment being observed . Similarly , mice transplanted with expanded grafts showed a hastened recovery in the cellularity of both organs that was most significant during the second week following transplantation , with maximal increases of 15 and 40-fold in the BM and spleen , respectively . Differences in peripheral leukocyte numbers between both groups of recipients were much less remarkable than those observed in the hematopoietic organs , although from the nadir period to the 11th day post-transplantation differences ranging from twofold to sixfold were apparent , consistent with a higher rate of mouse survival.
