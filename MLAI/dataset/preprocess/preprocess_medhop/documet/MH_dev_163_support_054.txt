Isoform-specific transcriptional regulation by thyroid hormone receptors : hormone-independent activation operates through a steroid receptor mode of co-activator interaction . Thyroid hormone receptors ( T3Rs ) are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play important roles in vertebrate homeostasis , differentiation , and development . T3Rs are synthesized as multiple isoforms that display tissue-specific expression patterns and distinct transcriptional properties . Most T3R isoforms associate with co-activator proteins and mediate transcriptional activation only in the presence of thyroid hormone . The pituitary-specific T3Rbeta-2 isoform departs from this general rule and is able to interact with P52701 co-activators , and to mediate transcriptional activation in both the absence and presence of hormone . We report here that this hormone-independent activation is mediated by contacts between the unique N terminus of T3Rbeta-2 and an internal interaction domain in the Q15788 ( steroid receptor co-activator-1 ) and Q9Y3R0 ( glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 ) co-activators . These hormone-independent contacts between T3Rbeta-2 and the P52701 co-activators are distinct in sequence and function from the LXXLL motifs that mediate hormone-dependent transcriptional activation and resemble instead a mode of co-activator recruitment previously observed only for the steroid hormone receptors and only in the presence of steroid hormone . Our results suggest that the transcriptional properties of the different T3R isoforms represent a combinatorial mixture of repression , antirepression , and hormone-independent and hormone-dependent activation functions that operate in conjunction to determine the ultimate transcriptional outcome .
