DB00013 stimulates human vascular smooth muscle cell migration via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Tyk2 interaction . Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 play an important role in urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) -dependent signaling . We have recently demonstrated that both kinases are associated with the uPA receptor ( Q03405 ) and mediate uPA-induced activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat1 , Stat2 , and Stat4 ) in human vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) . Janus kinases are not only required for Stat activation but may also interfere with other intracellular signaling pathways . Here we report that in VSMC , Tyk2 interacts with a downstream signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 -K ) . We demonstrate that uPA induces P19957 -K activation , which is abolished in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2 . The regulatory subunit p85 of P19957 -K co-immunoprecipitates with Tyk2 but not with Jak1 , Jak2 , or Jak3 , and uPA stimulation increases the P19957 -K activity in Tyk2 immunoprecipitates . Tyk2 directly binds to either of the two Src homology 2(SH2)p85 domains in a uPA-dependent fashion . We provide evidence that the Tyk2-mediated P19957 -K activation in response to uPA is required for VSMC migration . Thus , two unrelated structurally distinct specific inhibitors of P19957 -K , wortmannin and LY294002 , prevent VSMC migration induced by uPA . No migratory effect of uPA was observed in VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2 . Our results underscore the versatile function of Tyk2 in uPA-related intracellular signaling and indicate that P19957 -K plays a selective role in the regulation of VSMC migration .
