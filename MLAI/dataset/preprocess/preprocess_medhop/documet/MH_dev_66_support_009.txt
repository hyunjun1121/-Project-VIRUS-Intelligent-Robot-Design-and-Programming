DB00619 inhibition effect on KITAsn822Lys-mediated signal transduction cascade . OBJECTIVE : Alterations in growth factor signaling pathways may be a frequent collaborating event in Q01196 - Q06455 -mediated leukemogenesis . Gain-of-function P10721 receptor mutations have been reported in adult AML patients , especially those with core binding factor leukemia ( CBFL ) . We have previously reported a new gain-of-function P10721 (Asn822Lys) mutation that is constitutively expressed in the Kasumi-1 CBFL cell line , and has recently been described in two childhood AML patients . To explore the molecular basis of the effects of this mutation in the appropriate context of hemopoietic dysregulation , we investigated P10721 downstream signaling in the Kasumi-1 cell line by means of DB00619 ( Imatinib , Gleevec ) pharmacological inhibition . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We investigated P10721 (Asn822Lys) mutant-initiated signaling in Kasumi-1 cell line , and characterized the inhibitory effect of the DB00619 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor on downstream signaling . RESULTS : The use of DB00619 -mediated inhibition impaired the tyrosine phosphorylation of P10721 (Asn822Lys) and its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase ( p85PI3K ) . The downstream constitutive phosphorylation of P45983 /2 and P40763 was also significantly inhibited , but DB00619 had no effect on the constitutive activation of Akt , thus suggesting that it is due to other signaling in Kasumi-1 cells . DB00619 inhibited the P10721 -mediated proliferation of Kasumi-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner . CONCLUSIONS : These findings show the role of PI3K in P10721 (Asn822Lys)-mediated constitutive activation through the Akt-independent downstream signaling pathway of JNK , and also demonstrate the mutant 's susceptibility to DB00619 , which may therefore have therapeutic potential in CBFL patients with susceptible P10721 mutations .
