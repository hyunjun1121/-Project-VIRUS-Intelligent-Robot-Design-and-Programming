In vitro and in vivo evidence for a role of the Q99572 receptor in the release of P01584 in the murine brain . The P2X(7) receptor ( P2X(7)R ) is a purinoceptor expressed predominantly by cells of immune origin , including microglial cells . P2X(7)R has a role in the release of biologically active proinflammatory cytokines such as P01584 , P05231 and TNFalpha . Here we demonstrate that when incubated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , glial cells cultured from brain of P2X(7)R(-/-) mice produce less P01584 compared to glial cells from brains of wild-type mice . This is not the case for TNFalpha and P05231 . Our results indicate a selective effect of the P2X7R gene deletion on release of P01584 release but not of P05231 and TNFalpha . In addition , we confirm that only microglial cells produce IL-1beta , and this release is dependent on P2X(7)R and ABC1 transporter . Because P01584 is a key regulator of the brain cytokine network and P2X(7)R is an absolute requirement for P01584 release , we further investigated whether response of brain cytokines to LPS in vivo was altered in P2X(7)R(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice . P01584 and TNFalpha mRNAs were less elevated in the brain of P2X(7)R(-/-) than in the brain of wild-type mice in response to systemic LPS . These results show that P2X7R plays a key role in the brain cytokine response to immune stimuli , which certainly applies also to cytokine-dependent alterations in brain functions including sickness behavior .
