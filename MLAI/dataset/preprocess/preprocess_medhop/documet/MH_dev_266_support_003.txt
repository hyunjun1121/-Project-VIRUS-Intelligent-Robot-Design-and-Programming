Further characterization of a somatic cell hybrid panel : ten new assignments to the bovine genome . Thirty-six partially characterized hamster-bovine hybrid cell lines were used for the determination of synteny groups . Sixteen additional reference loci , selected for their coverage of the bovine genome , were analysed on these hybrid cells . This increases to 25 the number of synteny groups detected . This panel was then used to make synteny assignments for 10 additional loci , eight by Southern blotting ( P02452 , P08123 , FAS , P07858 , P07711 , P07510 , P07686 and P08908 ) and two by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification ( P35367 and ETH1112 ) . These loci were assigned to international synteny groups U12 ( P35367 ) , U13 ( P08123 ) , U17 ( P07510 ) , U21 ( P02452 , FAS ) , U29 ( ETH1112 ) , to chromosome 20 ( U14 or U25 ) for P07686 and P08908 , and to the same local synteny group ( A ) , which is probably U18 , for P07858 and P07711 . For three loci already mapped in humans ( P02452 , P08123 and P07510 ) , the present results are in accordance with the predictions based on comparative mapping between the human and bovine species .
