P15056 inhibitors suppress apoptosis through off-target inhibition of JNK signaling . DB08881 and dabrafenib selectively inhibit the P15056 ( P15056 ) kinase , resulting in high response rates and increased survival in melanoma . Approximately 22 % of individuals treated with vemurafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC ) during therapy . The prevailing explanation for this is drug-induced paradoxical P29323 activation , resulting in hyperproliferation . Here we show an unexpected and novel effect of vemurafenib/PLX4720 in suppressing apoptosis through the inhibition of multiple off-target kinases upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , principally Q9NYL2 . JNK signaling is suppressed in multiple contexts , including in cSCC of vemurafenib-treated patients , as well as in mice . Expression of a mutant Q9NYL2 that can not be inhibited reverses the suppression of JNK activation and apoptosis . Our results implicate suppression of JNK-dependent apoptosis as a significant , independent mechanism that cooperates with paradoxical P29323 activation to induce cSCC , suggesting broad implications for understanding toxicities associated with P15056 inhibitors and for their use in combination therapies .
