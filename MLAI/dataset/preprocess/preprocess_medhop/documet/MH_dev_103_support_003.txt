P43220 agonists for type 2 diabetes mellitus : recent developments and emerging agents . More than 26 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) . Many treatment options exist , but achieving long-term glycemic control in patients with T2D remains challenging . The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( P0C6A0 RAs ) offer a treatment option that improves glycemic control and reduces weight , with a low risk of hypoglycemia . They have emerged as attractive options for the treatment of T2D , and significant advances and developments continue to be published regarding these agents . To identify relevant literature on emerging issues related to P0C6A0 RAs , a search of the MEDLINE database was performed . Studies published in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of P0C6A0 RAs were analyzed . Because of their advantages and unique mechanism of action , P0C6A0 RAs are currently being studied in new clinical areas , including in combination with basal insulin , as adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes , and for weight loss . In addition , there are several emerging agents in development . DB09265 is a once-daily P0C6A0 RA that targets postprandial glucose and may be most useful when added to basal insulin as an alternative to rapid-acting insulin . DB09043 and dulaglutide are once-weekly P0C6A0 RAs that may offer more convenient dosing . The most common adverse effects of all P0C6A0 RA agents are gastrointestinal ( e.g. , nausea , diarrhea , and vomiting ) , but the rates of occurrence vary among agents . Due to the differences in pharmacokinetics , efficacy , rates of adverse effects , and administration requirements within the P0C6A0 RA class , each agent should be evaluated independently . The future of P0C6A0 RAs offers broader treatment options for T2D as well as potential in other treatment areas .
