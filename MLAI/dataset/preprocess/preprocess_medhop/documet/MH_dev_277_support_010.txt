Relatively selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition by 7-nitroindazole in monkey isolated cerebral arteries . The selectivity of 7-nitroindazole in inhibiting endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthases ( P29474 and P29475 ) was investigated by comparing its inhibitory action on relaxations mediated by nitric oxide ( NO ) in response to stimulation of perivascular nerves and in response to histamine in monkey cerebral artery strips . DB02207 at 2 x 10(-5) M moderately attenuated the response to transmural electrical stimulation and to nicotine , but did to alter the endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to histamine in cimetidine-treated strips . Raising the concentration of 7-nitroindazole to 10(-4) M abolished the neurogenic response , partially inhibited the histamine-induced relaxation , but did not affect the response to NO . It is concluded that 7-nitroindazole is a relatively selective P29475 inhibitor ; however , at high concentrations , it inhibits P29474 in monkey cerebral arteries .
