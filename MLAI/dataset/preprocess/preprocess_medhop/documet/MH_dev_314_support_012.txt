P04150 interacting protein-1 restores glucocorticoid responsiveness in steroid-resistant airway structural cells . Glucocorticoid ( GC ) insensitivity represents a profound challenge in managing patients with asthma . The mutual inhibition of transcriptional activity between GC receptor ( GR ) and other regulators is one of the mechanisms contributing to GC resistance in asthma . We recently reported that interferon regulatory factor ( Q969Q1 ) -1 is a novel transcription factor that promotes GC insensitivity in human airway smooth muscle ( P17405 ) cells by interfering with GR signaling ( Tliba et al. , Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2008;38:463-472 ) . Here , we sought to determine whether the inhibition of GR function by P10914 involves its interaction with the transcriptional co-regulator GR-interacting protein 1 ( Q9Y3R0 ) , a known GR transcriptional co-activator . We here found that siRNA-mediated Q9Y3R0 depletion attenuated P10914 -dependent transcription of the luciferase reporter construct and the mRNA expression of an P10914 -dependent gene , P28907 . In parallel experiments , Q9Y3R0 silencing significantly reduced GR-mediated transactivation activities . Co-immunoprecipitation and Q86UG4 pull-down assays showed that Q9Y3R0 , through its repression domain , physically interacts with P10914 identifying Q9Y3R0 as a bona fide transcriptional co-activator for P10914 . Interestingly , the previously reported inhibition of GR-mediated transactivation activities by either P01375 and P01579 treatment or P10914 overexpression was fully reversed by increasing cellular levels of Q9Y3R0 . Together , these data suggest that the cellular accumulation of P10914 may represent a potential molecular mechanism mediating altered cellular response to GC through the depletion of Q9Y3R0 from the GR transcriptional regulatory complexes .
