DB00091 and sanglifehrin A enhance chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin in P13671 glioma cells . Glioma is the most common type of brain tumors in adults , and treatment of high-grade gliomas is still palliative . Studies to date have revealed only modest effect in attenuating growth of these tumors with single agent therapy , but combination treatment appears to be more effective . P62937 ( CypA ) , a target of immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) and sanglifehrin A ( SFA ) , is an intracellular protein that has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( PPIase ) enzymatic activity . Previously , we showed that overexpressed CypA induced chemoresistance in cancer cells . Here we provide evidence that combination of cisplatin with either DB00091 or SFA synergistically enhances apoptotic cell death in P13671 glioma cells , compared with single agent treatment . Enhanced apoptotic cell death is a result of an increase in ROS generation and a decrease in intracellular glutathione levels . Consistently , CypA knockdown by siRNA also enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis . Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of CypA in human glioblastoma multiforme , but not in normal human astrocytes . CypA was also shown to be up-regulated in P13671 glioma cells during hypoxia . In conclusion , DB00091 or SFA in combination with cisplatin synergistically enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in P13671 glioma cells via inhibition of PPIase activity of CypA , indicating that development of new drugs that selectively inhibit the CypA PPIase activity without immune suppression may facilitate alleviation of chemoresistance in treatment of high-grade glioma .
