Inhibitory effects of botulinum toxin on P28335 receptor-induced Cl- current in Xenopus oocytes . Several low molecular weight G proteins have been identified , but their functional roles remain unclear . To clarify the involvement of low molecular weight G protein in receptor-stimulated turnover of polyphosphoinositide ( PI ) turnover , influences of botulinum toxins on serotonin ( 5-HT ) -stimulated Cl- current mediated by PI turnover were investigated using Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA . Treatment with botulinum toxin C , D or purified ADP-ribosyltransferase of botulinum toxin ( botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme ) inhibited the 5-HT-induced Cl- current in oocytes , and ADP-ribosylated 23 kDa proteins . Both botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme-induced inhibition of the current and ADP-ribosylation were suppressed by pretreatment with antibotulinum toxin P01024 enzyme antibody . Botulinum toxin D treatment of oocytes was ineffective in the response of Cl- current induced by injection of 50 pmol inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 50 pmol Ca2+ . It is suggested that low molecular weight G proteins ADP-ribosylated by botulinum toxin P01024 enzyme are involved in phospholipase C activation in Xenopus oocytes .
