[ Safety in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ] . The presentations at Digestive Disease Week 2013 emphasized treatment safety . Anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) agents and thiopurines are reasonably safe in breastfeeding and pregnancy . Several studies indicate that controlling the risk of tuberculosis when anti- P01375 agents are planned presents several problems , both in the initial diagnosis of latent tuberculosis and in subsequent patient follow-up , given that cases of tuberculosis continue to occur , despite recommendations . Thiopurines increase the risk of lymphoma , but there is no residual risk when these drugs are withdrawn . Despite increasing knowledge of the risks and recommendations on how to avoid them , there remain considerable shortfalls in the application of preventive measures and , more specifically , in vaccinations . DB00065 and cyclosporin produce similar results when used to treat severe outbreaks of ulcerative colitis . Thromboembolism prevention continues to be deficient , and the barriers to effective prevention concern not only physicians but can also involve nursing staff , for example . There is still a wide margin for improvement in safety . New drugs under study ( vedolizumab , DB06674 ) have not shown any hitherto unknown signs of significant toxicity .
