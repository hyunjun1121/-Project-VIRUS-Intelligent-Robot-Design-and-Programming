Targeted cytotoxic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( P01148 ) , AEZS-108 ( AN-152 ) , inhibits the growth of DU-145 human castration-resistant prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro through elevating P38936 and ROS levels . Management of castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) is challenging due to lack of efficacious therapy . DB00044 -releasing hormone analogs appear to act directly on cells based on the P01148 receptors on human prostate adenocarcinoma cells . We explored anticancer activity of a cytotoxic analog of P01148 , AEZS-108 consisting of P01148 agonist linked to doxorubicin . Nude mice bearing DU-145 tumors were used to compare antitumor effects of AEZS-108 with its individual constituents or their unconjugated combination . The tumor growth inhibition of conjugate was greatest among treatment groups ( 90.5 % inhibition vs. 41 % by [D-Lys(6)] P01148 +DOX ) . The presence of P01148 receptors on DU-145 cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry . In vitro , AEZS-108 significantly inhibited cell proliferation ( 61.2 % inhibition ) and elevated apoptosis rates ( by 46 % ) . By the detection of the inherent doxorubicin fluorescence , unconjugated doxorubicin was seen in the nucleus ; the conjugate was perinuclear and at cell membrane . Autophagy , visualized by GFP-tagged p62 reporter , was increased by AEZS-108 ( 7.9-fold vs. 5.3-fold by DOX+[D-Lys(6)] P01148 . AEZS-108 more effectively increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS , 2-fold vs. 1.4-fold by DOX+[D-Lys(6)] P01148 ) and levels of the apoptotic regulator P38936 in vivo and in vitro . We demonstrate robust inhibitory effects of the targeted cytotoxic P01148 analog AEZS-108 on P22888 positive castration-resistant prostate cancer cells .
