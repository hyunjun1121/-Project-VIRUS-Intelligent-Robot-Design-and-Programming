The mouse IFN-alpha ( Ifa ) locus : correlation of physical and linkage maps by in situ hybridization . The physical location of the mouse IFN-alpha locus ( Ifa ) on chromosome 4 was defined by in situ hybridization of a cloned mouse IFN-alpha probe to metaphase spreads in which one chromosome 4 was present as part of a single metacentric chromosome , all other chromosomes being acrocentric . ( This approach greatly facilitates analysis and can be used even when it is difficult to obtain good banding ) . Using unbanded chromosomes , the grains were localized over the chromosome 4 part of the metacentric , in a region 0.61 +/- 0.07 ( SD ) of the distance from the centromere to the telomere . In Giemsa-banded spreads , the majority of the grains were in the region 4C3 ---- P13671 . Consideration of these results and of the known linkage maps for mouse and man indicates that the Galt - Aco-1 - Ifa syntenic group spans a distance of approximately 14 cM and suggests that the same group on human 9p will also occupy a similarly sized region , with P07902 proximal and IFL distal to the centromere .
