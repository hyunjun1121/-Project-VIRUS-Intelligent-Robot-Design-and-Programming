The multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor linifanib ( DB06080 ) induces apoptosis through an Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent pathway . The P07333 -like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) plays an important role in controlling differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells . Activating mutations in P36888 occur in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ; 15 % -35 % ) , resulting in abnormal cell proliferation . Furthermore , both adult and pediatric patients with AML harboring the P36888 internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutation have a poor prognosis . Several inhibitors have been developed to target mutant P36888 for the treatment of AML , yet the molecular pathways affected by drug inhibition of the mutated P36888 receptor alone have not been characterized as yet . Linifanib ( DB06080 ) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that suppresses P36888 signaling . In this article , we show that treatment with linifanib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in ITD mutant cells in vitro and in vivo . We show that treatment with linifanib reduces phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β ) . In addition , we show that inhibition of GSK3β decreases linifanib-induced apoptosis . This study shows the importance of GSK3 as a potential target for AML therapy , particularly in patients with P36888 ITD mutations .
