Conditional ablation of mediator subunit MED1 ( MED1/ Q15648 ) gene in mouse liver attenuates glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone-induced hepatic steatosis . P04150 ( GR ) agonist dexamethasone ( DB00514 ) induces hepatic steatosis and enhances constitutive androstane receptor ( CAR ) expression in the liver . CAR is known to worsen hepatic injury in nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis . Because transcription coactivator MED1/ Q15648 gene is required for GR- and CAR-mediated transcriptional activation , we hypothesized that disruption of MED1/ Q15648 gene in liver cells would result in the attenuation of DB00514 -induced hepatic steatosis . Here we show that liver-specific disruption of MED1 gene ( MED1 ( delta Liv ) ) improves DB00514 -induced steatotic phenotype in the liver . In wild-type mice DB00514 induced severe hepatic steatosis and caused reduction in medium- and short-chain acyl- DB01992 dehydrogenases that are responsible for mitochondrial beta-oxidation . In contrast , DB00514 did not induce hepatic steatosis in mice conditionally null for hepatic MED1 , as it failed to inhibit fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the liver . MED1 ( delta Liv ) livers had lower levels of GR-regulated CAR mRNA compared to wild-type mouse livers . Microarray gene expression profiling showed that absence of MED1 affects the expression of the GR-regulated genes responsible for energy metabolism in the liver . These results establish that absence of MED1 in the liver diminishes DB00514 -induced hepatic steatosis by altering the GR- and CAR-dependent gene functions .
