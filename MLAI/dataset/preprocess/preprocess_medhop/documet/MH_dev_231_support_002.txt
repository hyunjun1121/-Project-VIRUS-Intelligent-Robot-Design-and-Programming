P35367 binding capacities in the amygdalas of the amygdaloid kindled rat . The histamine H1 receptor binding capacity of the amygdalas of amygdaloid kindled rats was studied . In the kindled nonstimulated amygdala , significant decreases in K(D) and B(max) values compared with those of control amygdala were found 1 week after the last kindled seizure . One month after the last kindled seizure , the decreased K(D) value was sustained in the kindled nonstimulated amygdala . This decreased Bmax value 1 week after the last kindled seizure in nonstimulated amygdala may partly and transiently contribute to kindled seizure susceptibility . The decreased K(D) value in nonstimulated amygdala observed until 1 month after the last kindled seizure indicates the long-lasting increment of binding affinity of the DB06691 binding site of the histamine H1 receptor in the steady state of kindled seizure susceptibility .
