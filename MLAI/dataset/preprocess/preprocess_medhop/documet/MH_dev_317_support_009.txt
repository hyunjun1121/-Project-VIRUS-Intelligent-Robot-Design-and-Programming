Changes of thyroid hormone levels and related gene expression in zebrafish on early life stage exposure to triadimefon . In this study , zebrafish was exposed to triadimefon . Thyroid hormones levels and the expression of related genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid ( Q9HD23 ) axis , including thyroid-stimulating hormone ( P01222 ) , deiodinases ( dio1 and dio2 ) and the thyroid hormone receptor ( thraa and thrb ) were evaluated . After triadimefon exposure , increased DB00451 can be explained by increased thyroid-stimulating hormone ( P01222 ) . The conversion of DB00451 to DB00279 ( deiodinase type I-dio1 ) was decreased , which reduced the DB00279 level . P10828 ( thrb ) mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated , possibly as a response to the decreased DB00279 levels . The overall results indicated that triadimefon exposure could alter gene expression in the Q9HD23 axis and that mechanisms of disruption of thyroid status by triadimefon could occur at several steps in the synthesis , regulation , and action of thyroid hormones .
