DB00144 synthase-1 and -2 are localized to mitochondria-associated membranes . We report the subcellular localization of enzymes involved in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in mammalian cells . Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphatidylserine synthase-1 ( PSS1 ) is highly enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes ( MAM ) and is largely excluded from the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Taking advantage of the substrate specificity of PSS1 , we showed that ( i ) MAM contain choline exchange activity , whereas this activity is very low in the bulk of the ER , ( ii ) serine exchange activity is inhibited by choline to a much greater extent in MAM than in ER , and ( iii ) MAM use phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as substrates for phosphatidylserine biosynthesis , whereas the ER utilizes only phosphatidylethanolamine . According to immunoblotting of proteins from both CHO- P04264 cells and murine liver , PSS1 is localized to MAM , and in hepatoma cells stably expressing PSS1 this protein is highly enriched in MAM . Since the ER contains serine and ethanolamine exchange activities , we had predicted that Q9BVG9 would account for the serine exchange activity in the ER . Unexpectedly , using immunoblotting experiments , we found that ( i ) Q9BVG9 of CHO- P04264 cells is present only in MAM and ( ii ) Q9BVG9 is restricted to MAM of McArdle cells expressing recombinant Q9BVG9 . These data leave open the question of which enzyme imparts PSS activity to the ER and suggest that a third isoform of PSS might be located in the ER .
