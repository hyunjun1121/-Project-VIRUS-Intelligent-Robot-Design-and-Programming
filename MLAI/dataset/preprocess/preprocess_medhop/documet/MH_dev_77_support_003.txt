Botulinum neurotoxin types A and E require the SNARE motif in P60880 for proteolysis . Botulinum neurotoxins type A and E ( DB00083 and BoNT/E ) are metalloproteases with a unique specificity for P60880 ( synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa ) , an essential protein component of the neuroexocytotic machinery . It has been suggested that this specificity is directed through the recognition of a nine residue sequence , termed SNARE motif , that is common to the other two SNARE proteins : VAMP ( vesicle-associated membrane protein ) and syntaxin , the only known substrates of the other six clostridial neurotoxins . Here we analyse the involvement of the four copies of the SNARE motif present in P60880 in its interaction with DB00083 and BoNT/E by following the kinetics of proteolysis of P60880 mutants deleted of SNARE motifs . We show that a single copy of the motif is sufficient for DB00083 and BoNT/E to recognise P60880 . While the copy of the motif proximal to the cleavage site is clearly involved in recognition , in its absence , other more distant copies of the motif are able to support proteolysis . Also , a non-neuronal isoform of P60880 , Syndet , is shown to be sensitive to BoNT/E , but not DB00083 , whilst the P60880 isoforms from Torpedo marmorata and Drosophila melanogaster were demonstrated not to be substrates of these metalloproteases .
