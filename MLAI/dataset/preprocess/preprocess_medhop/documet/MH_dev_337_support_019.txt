Characterization of the human adenylyl cyclase gene family : cDNA , gene structure , and tissue distribution of the nine isoforms . The membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases ( ACs ) represent one of the major families of effector enzymes for G protein-coupled receptors . Eight human AC isoforms , encoded by separate genes , have been identified up to now . However , in several cases only partial cDNA sequences are available ( Q08828 ,2,5 ) . A ninth expected isoform , the human ortholog of rat Q8NFM4 , has not been described yet . Using the high inter-species homology of mammalian AC isoforms , we searched the human genome and we succeeded to identify full-length coding sequences for all enzymes . Where required , missing sequence information was provided experimentally . Analysis of genomic sequences from the Celera database also allowed us to determine the exon-intron boundaries for Q08828 -9 and to establish the gene structures . We found that human AC genes comprise 11 to 26 exons , which are distributed over 16 to 430kb . We further report expression profiles for the nine ACs in a panel of 16 human tissues and in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) cells .
