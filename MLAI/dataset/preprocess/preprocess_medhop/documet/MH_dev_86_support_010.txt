Phase 1 study in Japan of siltuximab , an anti- P05231 monoclonal antibody , in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . DB09036 , a chimeric monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specificity for interleukin-6 , has been shown to enhance anti-multiple myeloma activity of bortezomib and corticosteroid in vitro . We evaluated the safety , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , and antitumor effect of siltuximab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma . This open-label , phase 1 , dose-escalating study used two doses of siltuximab : 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg ( administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle ) . In total , nine patients were treated . The most common grade 3/4 adverse events , lymphopenia ( 89 % ) and thrombocytopenia ( 44 % ) , occurred in patients receiving both doses of siltuximab ; however , no dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) were observed . Following intravenous administration of siltuximab at 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg , the maximum serum concentration and the area under the curve from 0 to 21 days and from 0 to infinity increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner . Mean half-life , total systemic clearance , and volume of distribution were similar at doses of 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg . Across both doses , six of the nine patients had complete or partial response ( 22 and 44 % , respectively ) . In conclusion , as no DLT was observed , the recommended dose for this combination is 11.0 mg/kg once every 3 weeks . The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01309412 .
