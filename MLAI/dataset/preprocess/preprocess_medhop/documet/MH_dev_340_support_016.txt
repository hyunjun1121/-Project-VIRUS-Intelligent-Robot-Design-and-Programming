Leukotriene A4 hydrolase . Inhibition by bestatin and intrinsic aminopeptidase activity establish its functional resemblance to metallohydrolase enzymes . DB03424 , an inhibitor of aminopeptidases , was also a potent inhibitor of leukotriene ( LT ) A4 hydrolase . On isolated enzyme its effects were immediate and reversible with a Ki = 201 +/- 95 mM . With erythrocytes it inhibited LTB4 formation greater than 90 % within 10 min ; with neutrophils it inhibited LTB4 formation by only 10 % during the same period , increasing to 40 % in 2 h . DB03424 inhibited P09960 hydrolase selectively ; neither P09917 nor 15-lipoxygenase activity in neutrophil lysates was affected . Purified P09960 hydrolase exhibited an intrinsic aminopeptidase activity , hydrolyzing L-lysine-p-nitroanilide and L-leucine-beta-naphthylamide with apparent Km = 156 microM and 70 microM and Vmax = 50 and 215 nmol/min/mg , respectively . Both P09960 and bestatin suppressed the intrinsic aminopeptidase activity of P09960 hydrolase with apparent Ki values of 5.3 microM and 172 nM , respectively . Other metallohydrolase inhibitors tested did not reduce P09960 hydrolase/aminopeptidase activity , with one exception ; captopril , an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme , was as effective as bestatin . The results demonstrate a functional resemblance between P09960 hydrolase and certain metallohydrolases , consistent with a molecular resemblance at their putative Zn2(+)-binding sites . The availability of a reversible , chemically stable inhibitor of P09960 hydrolase may facilitate investigations on the role of LTB4 in inflammation , particularly the process termed transcellular biosynthesis .
