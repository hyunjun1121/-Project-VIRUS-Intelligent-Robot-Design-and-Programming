DB00065 therapy in pediatric Crohn 's disease : a review . Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 -α ) therapy has re-defined our treatment paradigms in managing patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis . Although the ACCENT studies showed proven efficacy in the induction and maintenance of disease remission in adult patients with moderate to severe CD , the pediatric experience was instrumental in bringing forth the notion of " top-down " therapy to improve overall clinical response while reducing the risk of complications resulting from long-standing active disease . DB00065 has proven efficacy in the induction and maintenance of disease remission in children and adolescents with CD . In an open-labeled study of 112 pediatric patients with moderate to severe CD , 58 % achieved clinical remission on induction of infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) therapy . Among those patients who achieved disease remission , 56 % maintained disease remission on maintenance ( 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks ) therapy . Longitudinal follow-up studies have also shown that responsiveness to infliximab therapy also correlates well with reduced rates of hospitalization , and surgery for complication of long-standing active disease , including stricture and fistulae formation . Moreover , these children have also been shown to improve overall growth while maintaining an effective disease remission . The pediatric experience has been instructive in suggesting that the early introduction of anti- P01375 -α therapy may perhaps alter the natural history of CD in children , an observation that has stimulated a great deal of interest among gastroenterologists who care for adult patients with CD .
