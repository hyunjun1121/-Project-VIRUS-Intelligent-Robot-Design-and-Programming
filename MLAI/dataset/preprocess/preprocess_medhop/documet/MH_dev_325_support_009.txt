Combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and P34059 deficiency . We describe a Czech patient with combined adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ( P07741 ) deficiency ( 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis ) and P34059 ( P34059 ) deficiency ( mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA , Morquio disease A ) . DB00173 and its extremely insoluble derivative , 2,8-dihydroxyadenine , were identified in the urine , and P07741 deficiency was confirmed in erythrocytes . There was excessive excretion of keratan sulfate in the urine , and P34059 deficiency was confirmed in leukocytes . P34059 and P07741 are both located on chromosome 16q24.3 , suggesting that the patient had a deletion involving both genes . PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated that a novel junction was created by the fusion of sequences distal to P34059 exon 2 and proximal to P07741 exon 3 , and that the size of the deleted region was approximately 100 kb . The deletion breakpoints were localized within P34059 intron 2 and P07741 intron 2 . Several other genes , including the alpha subunit of cytochrome B ( P13498 ) , which is deleted or mutated in the autosomal form of chronic granulomatous disease , are located in the 16q24.3 region , but PCR amplification showed that this gene was present in the proband . A patient with hemizygosity for P34059 deficiency and P07741 deficiency has been reported from Japan recently . These findings indicate that : ( i ) P07741 is located telomeric to P34059 ; ( ii ) P34059 and P07741 are transcribed in the same orientation ( centromeric to telomeric ) ; and ( iii ) combined P07741 / P34059 deficiency may be more common than hitherto realized .
