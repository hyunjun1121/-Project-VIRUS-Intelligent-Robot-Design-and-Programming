P12004 D1b represses breast cancer cell growth by antagonizing the action of cyclin D1a on estrogen receptor alpha-mediated transcription . Alternate splicing of the cyclin D1 gene gives rise to transcripts a and b which encode two protein isoforms cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b . P12004 D1a can substitute for estrogen to activate estrogen receptor alpha- ( ERalpha ) mediated transcription and can induce the proliferation of estrogen responsive tissues . However , little is known about the biological role of cyclin D1b in transcriptional regulation . In this study , we determined that cyclin D1b is incapable of inducing ERalpha-mediated transcription because it fails to recruit steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) to ERalpha . Moreover , cyclin D1b antagonizes cyclin D1a-induced ERalpha-mediated transcription by competing with cyclin D1a for ERalpha binding . Cell proliferation assay showed that cyclin D1b repressed the ERalpha-positive breast cancer T47D cell growth . Our findings suggest that the cyclin D1b represses breast cancer cell growth by antagonizing the action of cyclin D1a on ERalpha-mediated transcription .
