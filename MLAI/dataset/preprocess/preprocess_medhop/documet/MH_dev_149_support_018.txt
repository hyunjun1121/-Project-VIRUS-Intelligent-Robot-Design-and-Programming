Construction of a bovine chromosome 19 linkage map with an interspecies hybrid backcross . Interspecific hybrid backcross animals from a Bos taurus x Bos gaurus F1 female were used to construct a linkage map of bovine Chromosome ( Chr ) 19 . This map includes eight previously unmapped type I anchor loci , P11230 , P05813 , P01241 , P12829 , P21359 , P07237 , P10827 , P04637 , and five microsatellite markers , HEL10 , BP20 , MAP2C , ETH3 , BMC1013 , from existing linkage maps . The linkage relationship was determined to be centromere-HEL10-18.8cM- P21359 -4.0cM- P05813 -11 .2cM- ( BP20 , P11230 , P04637 ) -4.0cM- ( MAP2C , P01241 , P12829 , P10827 ) -14.4cM- P07237 -11.2cM-ETH3-4 . 0cM-BMC1013 . It was previously revealed that bovine Chr 19 contains the largest known conserved autosomal synteny among human , bovine , and mouse . This study has shown that gene orders within this segment are not conserved among the three species . We propose structural changes in an ancestral mammalian chromosome to account for these differences . This is the first interspecific hybrid backcross used in bovine linkage studies , and it has proven to be an effective tool for incorporating bovine type I loci into the linkage map even with the small sample size presently available . This resource will facilitate the generation of comparative linkage maps that address gene order and effectively predict the locations of unmapped loci across species .
