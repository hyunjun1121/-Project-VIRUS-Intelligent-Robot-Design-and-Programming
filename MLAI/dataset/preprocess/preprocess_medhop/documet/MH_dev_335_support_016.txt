P05112 synthesis by in vivo-primed memory P01730 + T cells : II . Presence of P05112 is not required for P05112 synthesis in primed P01730 + T cells . Previous studies have shown that the presence of P05112 is required for the development of P05112 synthesis in naive P01730 + T cells . The purpose of our current studies was to investigate the role of P05112 in the development of P05112 synthesis in primed memory T cells . We therefore examined P01730 + T cells taken from lymph nodes of BALB/c mice immunized with DB05299 ( KLH ) and restimulated in vitro with KLH . Our results with such primed resting P01730 + T cells programmed to produce P05112 indicated that the production of P05112 did not require the presence of P05112 ( although the presence of P60568 was absolutely necessary ) , and was only slightly limited by the presence of anti- P05112 MAb . These results with resting memory T cells were not biased by the presence of activated T cells already producing substantial quantities of P05112 , since we demonstrated that high-density memory T cells could produce P05112 in the absence of P05112 , and because T cells that actively produce P05112 do not persist in vivo very long after antigen exposure . These results indicate that P05112 synthesis in T cells committed to P05112 production can indeed occur in the absence of P05112 when culture conditions have been optimized and suggest that therapies with anti- P05112 MAb or with soluble P05112 receptors designed to control the development of P05112 synthesis in memory T cells from individuals exhibiting excessive P05112 synthesis will be unsuccessful . Therefore , other therapies , for example , utilizing IL-12 , will be required to modulate the relatively fixed programs in memory T cells that direct the development of cytokine synthesis .
