Activation of Akt1 by human 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)1B receptors is sensitive to inhibitors of MEK . Akt1/protein kinase B and the mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 ( P27361 ) and P28482 have been shown to promote cell survival in a cell-specific manner . Since many receptors activate both pathways , inhibitors are commonly used to study the relative role of each pathway . In the present study , we examined the effects of PD098059 and U0126 , two structurally dissimilar inhibitors of Q96HU1 kinase kinase ( Q02750 /2 ) , on the activation of P29323 and Akt stimulated by human 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) ( serotonin ) ( P28222 ) receptors . Surprisingly , pathways for activation of both P29323 and Akt were found to be sensitive to the two MEK inhibitors at concentrations commonly used to selectively inhibit the activation of P29323 . Both compounds caused complete inhibition of phosphorylation of P29323 and a maximal 60 % inhibition of P28222 receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt . Inhibition of Akt activation required almost complete inhibition of P29323 . Transfection with cDNA for activated forms of Q02750 /2 caused increased phosphorylation of P29323 but not of Akt , demonstrating that independent activation of MEK/ P29323 was insufficient for activation of Akt . Therefore , it is not clear whether inhibition of activation of Akt resulted from selective inhibition of MEK or from additional actions on other unidentified common pathways . Nevertheless , our findings that PD098059 and U0126 inhibit activation of Akt at commonly used concentrations demonstrate that in at least some systems , these compounds inhibit activation of both P29323 and Akt , and can not be used to discern the relative roles of each pathway in mediating cellular responses .
