First analysis of the relation between P33261 genotype and pharmacodynamics in patients treated with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel : the ONSET/OFFSET and RESPOND genotype studies . BACKGROUND : The influence of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C19 genotype on platelet function in patients treated with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel is unknown . METHODS AND RESULTS : P33261 ( *1 , *2 , *3 , *4 , *5 , *6 , *7 , *8 , *17 ) genotyping was performed in patients with coronary artery disease treated with ticagrelor ( 180-mg load , 90 mg P55957 ) ( n=92 ) or clopidogrel ( 600-mg load , 75 mg/d ) ( n=82 ) . All patients received 75 to 100 mg/d aspirin . Platelet function was measured by aggregometry , VerifyNow Q9H244 assay , and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-phosphorylation assay at predose , 8 hours postloading , and maintenance . In each treatment group , patients were categorized according to 2C19 genotype carrier status ( loss-of-function , gain-of-function ) and metabolizer status . Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare platelet function among these categories for each treatment , and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare platelet function between the clopidogrel and ticagrelor groups for each category . There was no statistically significant influence of genotype on platelet function during aspirin therapy alone . DB08816 exhibited lower platelet reactivity than clopidogrel by all assays irrespective of 2C19 genotype or metabolizer status ( P < 0.01 ) . Loss-of-function carriers had greater platelet reactivity during clopidogrel therapy . The influence of genotype on platelet reactivity was greatest during clopidogrel maintenance and best demonstrated by the VerifyNow Q9H244 assay . CONCLUSIONS : This report is the first to demonstrate the superior pharmacodynamic effect of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel irrespective of P33261 genotype . Whereas P33261 genotype influenced the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel , there was no effect of P33261 genotype during ticagrelor therapy .
