Organizing pneumonia as a side effect of ipilimumab treatment of melanoma . DB06186 is one of the newly developed human monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma . Its primary mechanism of action is a specific blockade of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( P16410 ) , a T-cell receptor responsible for inhibition of lymphocyte activation . By blocking P16410 , ipilimumab enhances immune responses against tumor cells , but also exposes normal tissues to an increased risk of autoimmune phenomena as a potential side effect . In this report , we describe the case of a 58-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was treated with ipilimumab in the weeks prior to the onset of severe nonresolving dyspnea and cough . Extensive workup revealed organizing pneumonia as the cause of her hypoxemic respiratory failure and treatment with steroids led to a resolution of her pulmonary disease . To our knowledge , this is the first report of pulmonary toxicity caused by ipilimumab , which manifested on pathology as organizing pneumonia .
