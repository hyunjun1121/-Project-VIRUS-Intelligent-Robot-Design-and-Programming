[ Pharmacological and clinical profile of mitiglinide calcium hydrate ( Glufast ) , a new insulinotropic agent with rapid onset ] . DB01252 calcium hydrate ( mitiglinide , Glufast ) is a new insulinotropic agent of the glinide class with rapid onset . DB01252 is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the DB00171 -sensitive K(+) ( K( DB00171 ) ) channels in pancreatic beta-cells , and its early insulin release and short duration of action would be effective in improving postprandial hyperglycemia . In studies of various cloned K( DB00171 ) channels , mitiglinide shows a higher selectivity for the beta-cell type of Q09428 /Kir6.2 than the cardiac and smooth muscle types of K( DB00171 ) channels in comparison with glibenclamide and glimepiride . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the insulinotropic effect of mitiglinide is more potent than that of nateglinide , and mitiglinide surpassed in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia in normal and diabetic animals . In clinical trials , treatment with mitiglinide provided lasting improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients and decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels and HbA(1C) values . The incidence of adverse events related to mitiglinide were nearly equivalent to placebo ; in particular there was no difference with the frequency of hypoglycemia . The results from these studies indicated that mitiglinide could be expected to possess good therapeutic features of being effective in reducing postprandial glucose excursions in the early stage of Type 2 diabetes and less incidence of events suggestive of hypoglycemia .
