DB08901 ( DB08901 ) , a multitargeted pan-FGFR inhibitor with activity in multiple FGFR-amplified or mutated cancer models . Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family of kinases ( P11362 -4 ) are dysregulated in multiple cancers . DB08901 ( DB08901 ) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against P11274 - P00519 . DB08901 has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs , prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor . In Ba/ P13726 cells engineered to express activated P11362 -4 , ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values < 40 nmol/L , with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/ P13726 cells . In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types ( endometrial , bladder , gastric , breast , lung , and colon ) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms , ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values < 40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) ( concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells ) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L . Daily oral dosing of ponatinib ( 10-30 mg/kg ) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined . Importantly , the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in P11274 - P00519 -driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for P11362 -4 inhibition can be sustained in patients . These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers .
