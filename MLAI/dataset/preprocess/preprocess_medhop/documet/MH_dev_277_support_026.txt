DB04900 improves severe acute pancreatitis in rats via regulation of peripheral T cell number and cytokine serum level . AIM : The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thymosin alpha 1 ( Q96RJ0 ) on severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) in rats . METHODS : Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 72 ) were randomly divided into four groups : control group , SAP group , and two Q96RJ0 treated groups . SAP was induced by injection of 5 % sterile sodium taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct ( BPD ) , after which Q96RJ0 was given subcutaneously at 0 and 2 h at a dose of 100 microg/kg . The rats were killed at 3 , 6 and 12 h , respectively . Serum amylase and lipase , interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , pancreatic wet/dry weight ratio and the percentage of CD3/ P01730 +/CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were measured . Next , 30 rats were randomly divided into three groups ( each group containing 10 animals ) : SAP group ( S ) and two Q96RJ0 treated groups . The effects of Q96RJ0 on the survival of SAP were assessed 72 h after the induction of SAP . RESULTS : There was no significant change in the serum amylase and lipase levels after Q96RJ0 administration . Levels of serum IL-1beta , P01375 and pancreatic wet/dry weight ratio were significantly reduced after Q96RJ0 -treatment . Application of Q96RJ0 significantly balanced CD3/ P01730 +/CD8+ T cells of PBMC and improved histological scores and the survival rate . CONCLUSION : Q96RJ0 can reduce pancreatic inflammation by regulating differentiation of CD3/ P01730 + T cells and decreasing the release of cytokines , thus attenuates pancreatic severity in SAP rats .
