DB01656 inhibits respiratory syncytial virus infection in human differentiated bronchial epithelial cells . Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) causes acute exacerbations in P48444 and asthma . RSV infects bronchial epithelial cells ( P02100 ) that trigger RSV associated lung pathology . This study explores whether the phosphodiesterase 4 ( DB05876 ) inhibitor DB01656 N-oxide ( P59046 ) , alters RSV infection of well-differentiated P02100 ( WD- P02100 ) in vitro . WD- P02100 were RSV infected in the presence or absence of P59046 ( 0.1-100 nM ) . Viral infection ( staining of F and G proteins , nucleoprotein RNA level ) , mRNA of P05362 , ciliated cell markers ( digital high speed videomicroscopy , β-tubulin immunofluorescence , Foxj1 and Dnai2 mRNA ) , Goblet cells ( DB00233 ) , mRNA of P98088 and A8K7I4 , mRNA and protein level of P35225 , P05231 , P10145 , TNFα , formation of H2O2 and the anti-oxidative armamentarium ( mRNA of Nrf2 , P09601 , GPx ; total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) were measured at day 10 or 15 post infection . P59046 inhibited RSV infection of WD- P02100 , prevented the loss of ciliated cells and markers , reduced the increase of P98088 and A8K7I4 and inhibited the increase of P35225 , P05231 , P10145 , TNFα and P05362 . Additionally P59046 reversed the reduction of Nrf2 , P09601 and GPx mRNA levels and consequently restored the TAC and reduced the H2O2 formation . P59046 inhibits RSV infection of WD- P02100 cultures and mitigates the cytopathological changes associated to this virus .
