Gene profiling in Pap-cell smears of high-risk human papillomavirus-positive squamous cervical carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the study was to investigate benign and malignant squamous cervical cells obtained by cervical swabs with regard to differentially expressed genes and gene expression profiling , in order to evaluate the biological behavior and clinical outcome of cervical malignancies . METHODS : Cervical squamous cells from six women with high-risk human papillomavirus positive [ HR-HPV(+) ] cervical carcinoma and from six HPV-negative women with normal ectocervical cells were analyzed by cDNA array . RESULTS : cDNA over-expression of several genes such as MET ( c-met ) , Nm23-H1 ( P15531 ) , P00533 , P21802 , Nm23-H2 ( P22392 ) , P04626 ( c-erbB-2 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 4 ( CDKN2A , P42771 ) , cytokeratin 8 ( P05787 ) , P01116 ( K-ras ) , P17948 , KGF ( P21781 ) , P10415 -like 2 protein ( Q92843 ) , Q15303 , P04198 ( N-myc ) , cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) , P10721 ( c-kit ) , secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( P10451 ) and P42224 , was significant in cervical squamous cell carcinoma ( CSCC ) . Gene expression was downregulated for 13 genes in CSCC , such as interleukin 1 alpha ( P01583 ) , the transforming growth factor receptor beta superfamily ( TGFbeta ; P01137 ) , some members of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) and the integrin family ( P23229 , P05556 ) . CONCLUSION : This study was focused on the gene expression profiling of HR-HPV(-) and ( + ) cervical squamous cells and CSCC obtained by cytobrush . We observed gene expression patterns and signaling pathways that permit the investigator to distinguish between benign squamous cervical cells and CSCC with and without HPV infection .
