Cellular distribution and contribution of cyclooxygenase P35354 to diabetogenesis in NOD mouse . Unlike most other mammalian cells , beta-cells of Langerhans constitutively express cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 rather than P23219 . P35354 is also constitutively expressed in type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) patients ' periphery blood monocytes and macrophage . To understand the role of P35354 in the beta-cell , we investigated P35354 expression in beta-cells and islet infiltrates of NOD and BALB/c mice using fluorescence immunohistochemistry and cytochemical confocal microscopy and Western blotting . Immunostaining showed that P35354 is expressed in islet-infiltrating macrophages , and that the expression of insulin and P35354 disappeared concomitantly from the beta-cells when NOD mice progressed toward overt diabetes . Also cultured P01308 -1E cells coexpressed insulin and P35354 but clearly in different subcellular compartments . Treatment with celecoxib increased insulin release from these cells in a dose-dependent manner in glucose concentrations ranging from 5 to 17 mM . Excessive P35354 expression by the islet-infiltrating macrophages may contribute to the beta-cell death during insulitis . The effects of celecoxib on P01308 -1E cells suggest that PGE(2) and other downstream products of P35354 may contribute to the regulation of insulin release from the beta-cells .
