Prenatal diagnosis of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency in chorionic villi : a novel approach . DB00583 palmitoyltransferase 2 ( P23786 ) deficiency , the most common autosomal recessive inherited disease of the mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid ( LCFA ) beta-oxidation , may result in three distinct clinical phenotypes , namely , a mild adult muscular form , a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular disease , and a neonatal form , which includes dysmorphic features in addition to hepatocardiomuscular symptoms . Both the latter forms are life-threatening diseases , and prenatal diagnosis ( P01160 ) can be offered to couples at a one-fourth risk of having an affected child . P01160 of P23786 deficiency hitherto relied mostly on mutation detection from fresh chorionic villi ( 10 weeks ' gestation ) , since P23786 activity could be assayed on cultured amniocytes only ( 16-17 weeks ' gestation ) .We devised a P23786 activity assay from 10 mg of chorionic villi sampling ( CVS ) . Combining this enzymatic assay to haplotype study using polymorphic markers linked to the P23786 gene , we were able to carry out within 2 days , P23786 deficiency P01160 , in two unrelated families , using a CVS performed at the 11th week of gestation .
