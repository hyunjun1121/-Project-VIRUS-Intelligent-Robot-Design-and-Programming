P01375 -alpha blockade for the treatment of acute GVHD . Despite posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy , acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) remains a major cause of sickness and death . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) is implicated in the pathophysiology of GVHD at several steps in the process . DB00065 is a genetically constructed immunoglobulin P55008 ( IgG1 ) murine-human chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of P01375 , blocking its interaction with receptors and causing lysis of cells that produce P01375 . In this study we retrospectively evaluated 134 patients who had steroid-refractory acute GVHD . Of these , 21 who received infliximab as a single agent were analyzed . The overall response rate was 67 % ( n = 14 ) , and 13 patients ( 62 % ) experienced complete response ( CR ) . Five patients ( 24 % ) did not respond , and 2 ( 10 % ) had progressive GVHD . None had a toxic reaction to infliximab . Ten patients ( 48 % ) had 18 fungal infections , including Aspergillus species in 7 and Candida species in 10 . Seventeen patients ( 81 % ) had bacterial infections , including 32 gram-positive and 8 gram-negative infections . Viral infections , primarily cytomegalovirus reactivation , occurred in 14 patients ( 67 % ) . The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was 38 % . In conclusion , infliximab was well tolerated and active for the treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD , particularly with gastrointestinal tract involvement . Survival after steroid-resistant acute GVHD continues to be problematic . The possibility of excessive fungal and other infections must be explored further .
