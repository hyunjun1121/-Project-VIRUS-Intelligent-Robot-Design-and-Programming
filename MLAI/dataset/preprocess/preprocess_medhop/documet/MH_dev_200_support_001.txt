Synergy between vitamin D(3) and Toll-like receptor agonists regulates human dendritic cell response during maturation . Human dendritic cells ( DC ) can be differentiated from blood monocytes in the presence of GM- P04141 and P05112 and matured by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . DB00169 inhibits the maturation of human DC measured by changes in surface expression of HLA-DR , P08571 , P25942 , P33681 , Q01151 , and P42081 . We here examine the function of vitamin D3 during DC maturation . One of the earliest changes to LPS-induced maturation was an increase in Q01151 expression . DB00169 inhibited the increase in expression of HLA-DR , P25942 , P33681 , Q01151 , and P42081 and the decrease in expression of P08571 , which was paralleled morphologically by vitamin D3-induced inhibition of dendritic cell differentiation . DB00169 acted in synergy with the TLR agonists LPS and peptidoglycan ( Q9UQ90 ) in inducing P05231 , P10145 , and P22301 , whereas vitamin D3 completely inhibited LPS-induced secretion of IL-12 . The synergy occurred at concentrations where neither vitamin D3 nor the TLR agonists alone induced measurable cytokine secretion . Both LPS and Q9UQ90 enhanced the level of the vitamin D3 receptor ( P11473 ) . Taken together , these data demonstrated that vitamin D3 and TLR agonists acted in synergy to alter secretion of cytokines from human DC in a direction that may provide an anti-inflammatory environment .
