Region specific regulation of Q9UHB4 in rhesus monkeys following chronic antipsychotic drug administration . BACKGROUND : Altered DB01221 receptor subunit protein levels have been reported in various regions of the schizophrenic brain ; however , chronic antipsychotic administration in schizophrenic subjects may confound interpretation . METHODS : The effects of chronic antipsychotic drug administration ( haloperidol and clozapine ) on protein levels of Q9UHB4 , Q12879 and Q13224 proteins were evaluated in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) , putamen ( PUT ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , superior temporal gyrus ( Q6UXA7 ) , and entorhinal cortex ( EC ) of rhesus monkeys using Western blot analysis . RESULTS : DB00502 administration significantly decreased Q9UHB4 expression in the DLPFC . In contrast , Q13224 expression was not affected by antipsychotic administration in any brain region examined . Q12879 was not reliably detected in any of the brain regions . CONCLUSIONS : Results indicate that the Q9UHB4 subunit in the DLPFC may be a substrate for antipsychotic action and that glutamatergic hypofunction in the DLPFC commonly associated with cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia may be associated with haloperidol administration .
