Feasibility of using molecular docking-based virtual screening for searching dual target kinase inhibitors . Multitarget agents have been extensively explored for solving limited efficacies , poor safety , and resistant profiles of an individual target . Theoretical approaches for searching and designing multitarget agents are critically useful . Here , the performance of molecular docking to search dual-target inhibitors for four kinase pairs ( P24941 - P49841 , P00533 -Src , Lck-Src , and Lck- P35968 ) was assessed . First , the representative structures for each kinase target were chosen by structural clustering of available crystal structures . Next , the performance of molecular docking to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for each individual kinase target was evaluated . The results show that molecular docking-based virtual screening illustrates good capability to find known inhibitors for individual targets , but the prediction accuracy is structurally dependent . Finally , the performance of molecular docking to identify the dual-target kinase inhibitors for four kinase pairs was evaluated . The analyses show that molecular docking successfully filters out most noninhibitors and achieves promising performance for identifying dual-kinase inhibitors for P24941 - P49841 and Lck- P35968 . But a high false-positive rate leads to low enrichment of true dual-target inhibitors in the final list . This study suggests that molecular docking serves as a useful tool in searching inhibitors against dual or even multiple kinase targets , but integration with other virtual screening tools is necessary for achieving better predictions .
