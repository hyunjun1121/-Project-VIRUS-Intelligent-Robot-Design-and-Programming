The anticoagulant effect of PGI2S and tPA in transgenic umbilical vein endothelial cells is linked to up-regulation of PKA and PKC . The selection of vascular grafts for coronary artery bypass surgery is crucial for a positive outcome . This study aimed to establish a novel line of vascular endothelial cells with a potent anticoagulant effect . A lentiviral vector was used to stably transfect human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) with PGI2S alone ( HUVEC-PGI2S ) or both PGI2S and tPA ( HUVEC-PGI2S-tPA ) . Both HUVEC-PGI2S and HUVEC-PGI2S-tPA cells over-expressing PGI2S and tPA were compared to mock-transfected cells . The enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay ( ELISAs ) demonstrated that the anticoagulation components , P01008 and P00747 , were up-regulated and coagulation factor FVIII was down-regulated in both cell lines . QRT-PCR and western blotting demonstrated the vasodilation and platelet disaggregation proteins PKA , PKC , and P43119 were up-regulated in both cell lines , but MAPK expression was not altered in either cell line . However , cell viability and colony formation assays and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that both cell lines had a lower rate of cell growth and induced P55008 phase arrest . HUVEC-PGI2S and HUVEC-PGI2S-tPA cells have a potent anticoagulant effect and their use in vascular heterografts may decrease the risk of thrombosis .
