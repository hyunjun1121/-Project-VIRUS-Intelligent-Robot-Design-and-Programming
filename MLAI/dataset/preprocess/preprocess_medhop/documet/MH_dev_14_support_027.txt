Protective effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade against neuropathy in experimental diabetic rats . AIMS : P08235 ( MR ) blockade is an effective treatment for hypertension and diabetic nephropathy . There are no data on the effects of MR blockade on diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . The aim of this study was to determine whether MRs are present in the peripheral nerves and to investigate the effectiveness of MR blockade on DPN in streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -induced diabetic rats . METHODS : Expression of MR protein and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) was examined in the peripheral nerves using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR . We next studied the effects of the selective MR antagonist eplerenone and the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan on motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) , morphometric changes and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) gene and NF-κB protein expression in the peripheral nerves of Q11206 -induced diabetic rats . RESULTS : Expression of MR protein and mRNA in peripheral nerves was equal to that in the kidney . Motor NCV was significantly improved by 8 weeks of treatment with either eplerenone ( Q04695 ± 1.2 m/s ) or candesartan ( 46.4 ± 6.8 m/s ) compared with control diabetic rats ( 33.7 ± 2.0 m/s ) ( p < 0.05 ) . Sensory NCV was also improved by treatment with candesartan or eplerenone in diabetic rats . DB00700 and candesartan caused significant improvement in mean myelin fibre area and mean myelin area compared with control diabetic rats ( p < 0.05 ) . P35354 mRNA and NF-κB protein were significantly elevated in the peripheral nerves of diabetic rats compared with control rats , and treatment with eplerenone or candesartan reduced these changes in gene expression ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : MR blockade may have neuroprotective effects on DPN .
