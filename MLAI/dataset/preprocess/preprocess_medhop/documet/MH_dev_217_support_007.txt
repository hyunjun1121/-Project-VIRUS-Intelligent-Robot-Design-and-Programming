Pharmacogenetics and future strategies in treating hyperglycaemia in diabetes . This review focuses on current evidence for pharmacogenetics for the 3 commonly used drug classes in treating diabetes : metformin , sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones . Currently , metformin pharmacogenetics is focussing on drug transport with the recent finding that variation in O75051 transporters might affect metformin response . An aetiological approach has identified monogenic patients with diabetes due to TCF1 mutations who are particularly sensitive to the hypoglycaemic effects of sulphonylureas , and Q14654 or Q09428 mutations in which sulphonylureas can be used in place of insulin treatment . In Type 2 diabetes sulphonylurea response has been shown to be associated with variants Q9NQB0 associated with type 2 diabetes risk . For thiazolidinediones , focus has been on PPARgamma variants although with no consistent result . Genome wide association studies offer great potential to unravel what genetic factors influence response and side effects of diabetes therapies . Large numbers of well phenotyped patients for response and side effect as well as similarly sized similarly phenotyped replication cohorts are required . Establishing such cohorts is a priority in diabetes pharmacogenetics research .
