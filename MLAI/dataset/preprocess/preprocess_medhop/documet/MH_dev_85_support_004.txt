Expression of adhesion molecules and c-kit on P28906 + hematopoietic progenitor cells : comparison of cytokine-mobilized blood stem cells with normal bone marrow and peripheral blood . We assessed the expression of the adhesion molecules leukocyte function antigen-1 ( LFA-1 , CD11a ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 , CD54 ) , homing-associated cell adhesion molecule ( H- P62158 , P16070 ) , and c-kit ( stem cell factor receptor ) on the P28906 + progenitor population from the leukapheresis products of 23 patients ( LP P28906 + ) . For blood stem cell collection granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) or interleukin-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( P08700 /GM- P04141 ) was administered after cytotoxic chemotherapy . Furthermore , bone marrow- and blood-derived P28906 + progenitor cells from 6 normal volunteers ( BM and PB P28906 + ) were analyzed . LFA-1 expression was higher on PB P28906 + ( 88.2 +/- 2.5 % , mean +/- SEM ) than on BM P28906 + ( 75.3 +/- 4.3 % ) . Following cytokine administration , LFA-1 was expressed on only 59.7 +/- 3.7 % of LP P28906 + at a low fluorescence intensity , suggesting that down-regulation of LFA-1 may facilitate the egress of cells from the bone marrow and prolong their circulation . In contrast , P05362 was weakly positive on P28906 + cells from all sources . P16070 was expressed on the vast majority of P28906 + cells ( > 95 % ) in all samples studied . The highest proportion of P28906 + cells costaining for c-kit was found in normal bone marrow ( 32.2 +/- 3.3 % ) . In normal peripheral blood and after cytokine mobilization , fewer of the P28906 + cells weakly expressed c-kit ( < 15 % ) . The low percentage and level of c-kit expression may indicate that the majority of cytokine-mobilized P28906 + cells are lineage-committed progenitor cells , as reflected by the coexpression pattern for P28907 , HLA-DR , and P20138 .
