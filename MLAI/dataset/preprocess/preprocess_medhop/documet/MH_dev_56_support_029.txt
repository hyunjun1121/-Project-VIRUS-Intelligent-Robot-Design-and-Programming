Cannabinoid receptor activation induces apoptosis through tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated ceramide de novo synthesis in colon cancer cells . PURPOSE : Cannabinoids have been recently proposed as a new family of potential antitumor agents . The present study was undertaken to investigate the expression of the two cannabinoid receptors , P21554 and CB2 , in colorectal cancer and to provide new insight into the molecular pathways underlying the apoptotic activity induced by their activation . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Cannabinoid receptor expression was investigated in both human cancer specimens and in the DLD-1 and HT29 colon cancer cell lines . The effects of the P21554 agonist arachinodyl-2'-chloroethylamide and the CB2 agonist N-cyclopentyl-7-methyl-1-(2-morpholin-4-ylethyl)-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-on-3-carboxamide ( CB13 ) on tumor cell apoptosis and ceramide and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production were evaluated . The knockdown of P01375 mRNA was obtained with the use of selective small interfering RNA . RESULTS : We show that the P21554 receptor was mainly expressed in human normal colonic epithelium whereas tumor tissue was strongly positive for the CB2 receptor . The activation of the P21554 and , more efficiently , of the CB2 receptors induced apoptosis and increased ceramide levels in the DLD-1 and HT29 cells . Apoptosis was prevented by the pharmacologic inhibition of ceramide de novo synthesis . The CB2 agonist CB13 also reduced the growth of DLD-1 cells in a mouse model of colon cancer . The knockdown of P01375 mRNA abrogated the ceramide increase and , therefore , the apoptotic effect induced by cannabinoid receptor activation . CONCLUSIONS : The present study shows that either P21554 or CB2 receptor activation induces apoptosis through ceramide de novo synthesis in colon cancer cells . Our data unveiled , for the first time , that P01375 acts as a link between cannabinoid receptor activation and ceramide production .
