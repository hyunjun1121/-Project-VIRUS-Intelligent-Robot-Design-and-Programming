P29323 activation of P38936 activated kinase-1 ( Pak1 ) is critical for medulloblastoma cell migration . We previously identified that overexpression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) is associated with metastatic medulloblastoma ( MB ) and showed that PDGF treatment increases P29323 activity and promotes MB cell migration . In this study , we investigated whether P29323 regulates Rac1/Pak1 signaling and is critically linked to MB cell migration . Herein we demonstrate that DB00102 treatment of MB cells induces concomitant activation of PDGFRβ , Q02750 / P29323 , Rac1 and Pak1 , but suppresses Rho activity , which together significantly promotes cell migration . Conversely , cells transfected with either PDGFRβ or Pak1 siRNA or treated with an inhibitor of Rac1 ( NSC23766 ) or N-myristoyltransferase-1 ( DB03754 -dipalladium ) are unable to activate Rac1 or Pak1 in response to PDGF , and consequently , are unable to undergo PDGF-mediated cell migration . Furthermore , we also demonstrate that either chemical inhibition of MEK/ P29323 ( U0126 ) or stable downregulation of PDGFRβ by shRNA similarly results in the loss of PDGF-induced P29323 phosphorylation and abolishes Rac1/Pak1 activation and cell migration in response to PDGF . However , specific depletion of Pak1 by siRNA has no effect on PDGF-induced P29323 phosphorylation , indicating that in MB cells P29323 signaling is Pak1-independent , but PDGF-induced migration is dependent on P29323 -mediated activation of Pak1 . Finally , using tissue microarrays , we detect phosphorylated Pak1 in 53 % of medulloblastomas and show that immunopositivity is associated with unfavorable outcome . We conclude that Rac1/Pak1 signaling is critical to MB cell migration and is functionally dependent on PDGFRβ/ P29323 activity .
