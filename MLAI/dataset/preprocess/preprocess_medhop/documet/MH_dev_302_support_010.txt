Decreasing Poly(ADP- DB01936 ) Polymerase Activity Restores ΔF508 P13569 Trafficking . Most cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in P13569 that prevent its trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane and is associated with exaggerated inflammation , altered metabolism , and diminished responses to oxidative stress . P09874 is activated by oxidative stress and causes energy depletion and cell dysfunction . Inhibition of this enzyme protects against excessive inflammation and recent studies have also implicated it in intracellular protein trafficking . We hypothesized that P09874 activity is altered in CF and affects trafficking and function of the most common CF mutant ΔF508 P13569 . Indeed , P09874 activity was 2.9-fold higher in CF ( ΔF508/ΔF508 ) human bronchial epithelial primary cells than in non-CF cells , and similar results were obtained by comparing CF vs. non-CF bronchial epithelial cell lines ( 2.5-fold higher in CFBE41o(-) vs. 16HBE14o(-) , P < 0.002 ) . A P09874 inhibitor ( ABT-888 , DB07232 ) partially restored P13569 channel activity in CFBE41o(-) cells overexpressing ΔF508 P13569 . Similarly , reducing P09874 activity by 85 % in ileum from transgenic CF mice ( Cftr(tm1)Eur ) partially rescued ΔF508 P13569 activity to 7 % of wild type mouse levels , and similar correction ( 7.8 % ) was observed in vivo by measuring salivary secretion . Inhibiting P09874 with ABT-888 or siRNA partially restored ΔF508 P13569 trafficking in cell lines , and most ΔF508 P13569 was complex glycosylated when heterologously expressed in P09874 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts . Finally , levels of the mature glycoform of P13569 were reduced by peroxynitrite , a strong activator of P09874 . These results demonstrate that P09874 activity is increased in CF , and identify a novel pathway that could be targeted by proteostatic correctors of P13569 trafficking .
