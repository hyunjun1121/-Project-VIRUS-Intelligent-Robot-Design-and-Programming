Analysis of human platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated disintegrins with flow cytometry . Disintegrins are a group of snake venom peptides which inhibit human platelet aggregation by acting as glycoprotein IIb-IIIa ( P08514 -IIIa ) antagonists . They are cysteine-rich , DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 ( RGD ) -containing peptides , and bind to P08514 -IIIa complex on platelet membrane with a very high affinity ( Kd , 10(-7)-10(-8) M ) . In this study , we analyzed P08514 -IIIa complex on platelet membrane by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated disintegrins as probes . Of these FITC-conjugated disintegrins , FITC-Rhodostomin is the most sensitive probe because Rhodostomin was conjugated with more FITC molecules than Trigramin and Halysin were . The binding fluorescence intensity of FITC-Trigramin ( FITC-Tg ) , FITC-Halysin ( FITC-Hy ) and FITC-Rhodostomin ( FITC-Rn ) was measured in both resting and ADP-activated platelets of diluted human platelet-rich plasma . The binding fluorescence of FITC-disintegrins was abolished by DB00974 and DB00054 , a monoclonal antibody against P08514 -IIIa . ADP markedly increased the fluorescence intensity of FITC-Tg and FITC-Hy bound on platelets especially when lower doses of these probes were used , whereas it had little effect on that of FITC-Rn . Therefore , FITC-Tg and FITC-Hy can be used for the detection of the activated platelets as noted by a higher ratio of fluorescence intensity ( approx. 2-4 ) between ADP-activated and resting platelets as compared with that ( approx. 1-1.3 ) in the case of FITC-Rn as the probe . The platelets from three patients with Glanzmann 's thrombasthenia were probed with FITC-disintegrins. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
