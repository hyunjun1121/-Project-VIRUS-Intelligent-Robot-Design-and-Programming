DB08820 potentiation of multiple P13569 channels with gating mutations . BACKGROUND : The investigational P13569 potentiator ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) increased P13569 channel activity and improved lung function in subjects with CF who have the G551D P13569 gating mutation . The aim of this in vitro study was to determine whether ivacaftor potentiates mutant P13569 with gating defects caused by other P13569 gating mutations . METHODS : The effects of ivacaftor on P13569 channel open probability and chloride transport were tested in electrophysiological studies using Fischer rat thyroid ( P17948 ) cells expressing different P13569 gating mutations . RESULTS : DB08820 potentiated multiple mutant P13569 forms with defects in P13569 channel gating . These included the G551D , G178R , S549N , S549R , G551S , G970R , G1244E , S1251N , S1255P and G1349D P13569 gating mutations . CONCLUSION : These in vitro data suggest that ivacaftor has a similar effect on all P13569 forms with gating defects and support investigation of the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor in CF patients who have P13569 gating mutations beyond G551D .
