Glioma-associated microglial P14780 expression is upregulated by O60603 signaling and sensitive to minocycline . The invasiveness of malignant gliomas is one of the major obstacles in glioma therapy and the reason for the poor survival of patients . Glioma cells infiltrate into the brain parenchyma and thereby escape surgical resection . Glioma associated microglia/macrophages support glioma infiltration into the brain parenchyma by increased expression and activation of extracellular matrix degrading proteases such as matrix metalloprotease ( MMP ) 2 , P14780 and membrane-type 1 MMP . In this work we demonstrate that , P14780 is predominantly expressed by glioma associated microglia/macrophages in mouse and human glioma tissue but not by the glioma cells . Supernatant from glioma cells induced the expression of P14780 in cultured microglial cells . Using mice deficient for different Toll-like receptors we identified O60603 /6 as the signaling pathway for the glioma induced upregulation of microglial P14780 . Also in an experimental mouse glioma model , O60603 deficiency attenuated the upregulation of microglial P14780 . Moreover , glioma supernatant triggered an upregulation of O60603 expression in microglia . Both , the upregulation of P14780 and O60603 were attenuated by the antibiotic minocycline and a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase antagonist in vitro . DB01017 also extended the survival rate of glioma bearing mice when given to the drinking water . Thus glioma cells change the phenotype of glioma associated microglia/macrophages in a complex fashion using O60603 as an important signaling pathway and minocycline further proved to be a potential candidate for adjuvant glioma therapy .
