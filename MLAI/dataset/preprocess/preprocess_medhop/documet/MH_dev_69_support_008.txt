Selective deletion of P60484 in dopamine neurons leads to trophic effects and adaptation of striatal medium spiny projecting neurons . The widespread distribution of the tumor suppressor P60484 in the nervous system suggests a role in a broad range of brain functions . P60484 negatively regulates the signaling pathways initiated by protein kinase B ( Akt ) thereby regulating signals for growth , proliferation and cell survival . Pten deletion in the mouse brain has revealed its role in controlling cell size and number . In this study , we used Cre-loxP technology to specifically inactivate Pten in dopamine ( DA ) neurons ( Pten KO mice ) . The resulting mutant mice showed neuronal hypertrophy , and an increased number of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in the ventral mesencephalon . Interestingly , quantitative microdialysis studies in Pten KO mice revealed no alterations in basal DA extracellular levels or evoked DA release in the dorsal striatum , despite a significant increase in total DA tissue levels . Striatal dopamine receptor D1 ( P21728 ) and prodynorphin ( PDyn ) mRNA levels were significantly elevated in KO animals , suggesting an enhancement in neuronal activity associated with the striatonigral projection pathway , while dopamine receptor D2 ( P14416 ) and preproenkephalin ( PPE ) mRNA levels remained unchanged . In addition , P60484 inactivation protected DA neurons and significantly enhanced DA-dependent behavioral functions in KO mice after a progressive 6OHDA lesion . These results provide further evidence about the role of P60484 in the brain and suggest that manipulation of the P60484 /Akt signaling pathway during development may alter the basal state of dopaminergic neurotransmission and could provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson 's disease , and other neurodegenerative disorders .
