Localized Epidermal Cysts as a Radiation Recall Phenomenon in a Melanoma Patient Treated with Radiotherapy and the P15056 Inhibitor DB08881 . P15056 inhibitors are broadly used for metastatic melanoma with P15056 mutations . Their use results in various cutaneous side effects , such as the development of keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas . We report a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib who developed dozens of histologically confirmed epidermal cysts within 2 months after initiation of vemurafenib administration . The cystic lesions were observed only in the localized area where a large exophytic melanoma tumor mass had been previously irradiated . Localized epidermal cysts may constitute an unusual radiation recall reaction in patients treated with P15056 inhibitors .
