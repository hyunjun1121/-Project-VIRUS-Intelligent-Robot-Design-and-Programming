Glycyrrhetinic acid induces G1‑phase cell cycle arrest in human non‑small cell lung cancer cells through endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway . Glycyrrhetinic acid ( GA ) is a natural compound extracted from liquorice , which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effect of GA in human non‑small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , and its underlying mechanisms in vitro . We have shown that GA suppressed the proliferation of A549 and NCI‑H460 cells . Flow cytometric analysis showed that GA arrested cell cycle in G0/ P55008 phase without inducing apoptosis . Western blot analysis indicated that GA mediated G1‑phase cell cycle arrest by upregulation of cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitors ( CKIs ) ( p18 , p16 , p27 and P38936 ) and inhibition of cyclins ( cyclin‑D1 , ‑D3 and ‑E ) and cyclin‑dependent kinases ( CDKs ) ( P11802 , 6 and 2 ) . GA also maintained P06400 phosphorylation status , and inhibited E2F transcription factor 1 ( E2F‑1 ) in both cell lines . GA upregulated the unfolded proteins , Bip , Q9NZJ5 and P13667 . Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) triggered the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) , which could be the mechanism by which GA inhibited cell proliferation in NSCLC cells . GA then coordinated the induction of ER chaperones , which decreased protein synthesis and induced cell cycle arrest in the P55008 phase . This study provides experimental evidence to support the development of GA as a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC .
