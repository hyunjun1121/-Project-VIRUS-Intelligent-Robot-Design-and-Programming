Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation in murine autaptic hippocampal neurones . Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation and inhibition ( Q9UL01 and DSI ) appear to be important forms of short-term retrograde neuronal plasticity involving endocannabinoids ( eCB ) and the activation of presynaptic cannabinoid P21554 receptors . We report here that P21554 -dependent Q9UL01 can be elicited from autaptic cultures of excitatory mouse hippocampal neurones . Q9UL01 in autaptic cultures is both more robust and elicited with a more physiologically relevant stimulus than has been thus far reported for conventional hippocampal cultures . An additional requirement for autaptic Q9UL01 is filled internal calcium stores . Pharmacological experiments favour a role for 2-arachidonyl glycerol ( 2-AG ) rather than arachidonyl ethanolamide ( AEA ) or noladin ether as the relevant endocannabinoid to elicit Q9UL01 . In particular , the latter two compounds fail to reversibly inhibit EPSCs , a quality inconsistent with the role of bona fide eCB mediating Q9UL01 . Delta9- DB00470 ( delta9-THC ) fails to inhibit EPSCs , yet readily occludes both Q9UL01 and EPSC inhibition by a synthetic P21554 agonist , Q08050 55212-2 . With long-term exposure ( approximately 18 h ) , delta9-THC also desensitizes P21554 receptors . Lastly , a functional endocannabinoid transporter is necessary for the expression of Q9UL01 .
