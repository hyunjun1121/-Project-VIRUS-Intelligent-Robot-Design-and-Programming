P37231 reduces the growth rate of pancreatic cancer cells through the reduction of cyclin D1 . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) forms a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex with the retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and regulates the transcription of its target genes . Activation of PPARgamma has been shown to induce P55008 arrest and to inhibit cell growth of human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines . The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of ligand activation of PPARgamma and RXR on cell growth and on the expression of P55008 cyclins in a pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 , which expresses PPARgamma at high levels . DB00197 , a specific ligand for PPARgamma , was found to cause a reduction in the growth rate and induced P55008 cell cycle arrest and this effect was additive with that of 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cis RA ) , a ligand for RXR . Of the P55008 cyclins tested , troglitazone specifically reduced the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and the corresponding protein and this effect was also additive with 9-cis RA . These results suggest that the activation of PPARgamma together with RXR may be useful for the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell growth through the reduction in cyclin D1 levels .
