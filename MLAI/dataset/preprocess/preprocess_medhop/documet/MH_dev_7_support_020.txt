Inhibition of Akt/ P31749 by a P35354 inhibitor induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells . BACKGROUND/AIM : Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 has been proposed to be a potential mechanism for the chemoprevention of gastrointestinal tumors by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . This study investigates the mechanisms by which the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor SC236 induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cell lines and its downstream signaling pathway . METHODS : Two gastric cancer cell lines , AGS and MKN28 , were treated with SC236 and assessed for cell growth and apoptosis . The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase/protein kinase B ( Akt/ P31749 ) pathways and their downstream signalings were studied in the AGS cell line . RESULTS : SC236 treatment induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells and caused activation of p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase , but down-regulated Akt/ P31749 . The specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative stress-activated protein kinase/jun kinase both failed , while the constitutively active form of Akt/ P31749 was able to block SC236-induced apoptosis . SC236-induced apoptosis was coupled with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases . CONCLUSION : One of the pathways involved in SC-236-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells is through downregulation of Akt and then release of cytochrome c .
