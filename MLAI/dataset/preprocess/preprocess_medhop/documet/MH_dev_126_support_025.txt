[ Molecular target-based cancer therapy : epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors ] . Based on recent progress in cancer biology , numerous molecules that contribute to proliferation , invasion , and metastasis of cancer cells have been identified . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) , a member of cell membrane receptors , is overexpressed by many tumors , and P00533 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and disease progression . The P00533 is an attractive target for novel anticancer therapy . ZD1839 and DB00530 , highly specific P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors , have shown promising antitumor activity against cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer in phase I and phase II trials . IMC-C225 , a monoclonal antibody against P00533 , has achieved significant disease control in head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer in combination with anticancer agents . These agents are under evaluation in phase III trials . In conclusion , it is expected that P00533 -directed therapies will soon be established as an effective novel treatment for many cancer patients .
