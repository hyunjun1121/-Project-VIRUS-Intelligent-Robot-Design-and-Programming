Q9GZP0 inhibition by DB05139 ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis following experimental glomerulonephritis . BACKGROUND : Arresting or regressing kidney scarring is of major clinical relevance . Q9GZP0 ( Q9GZP0 ) is widely expressed in fibrotic kidneys . Administration of the Q9GZP0 neutralizing fully human monoclonal antibody DB05139 in the acute phase of progressive anti-Thy 1.1 glomerulonephritis reduced glomerular and secondary tubulointerstitial damage . METHODS : Using this model , we now assessed the effects of DB05139 ( n=15 ) vs irrelevant control IgG ( n=17 ) administered on days 17 , 28 and 35 after disease induction , i.e. after acute glomerular damage had subsided . RESULTS : In vitro , DB05139 inhibited the Q9GZP0 - but not the PDGF-B-induced proliferation of rat renal fibroblasts . Following the first DB05139 injection on day 17 , exposure to therapeutic levels was maintained until day 49 . Proteinuria in the DB05139 -treated group was transiently reduced between days 49 and 77 ( -19 to -23 % in comparison with the controls ; P < 0.05 ) . On day 100 , DB05139 treatment reduced the number of rats that had doubled their serum creatinine ( DB05139 : 40 vs controls : 71 % ; P < 0.05 ) . Compared with controls , the DB05139 animals , on day 100 , significantly lowered glomerular expression of vimentin and collagens as well as tubulointerstitial damage scores , interstitial fibrosis , vimentin and cortical Q9GZP0 mRNA levels . CONCLUSIONS : Q9GZP0 antagonism , even after the phase of acute glomerular damage , exerts beneficial effects on the course of tubulointerstitial damage , i.e. the final common pathway of most renal diseases .
