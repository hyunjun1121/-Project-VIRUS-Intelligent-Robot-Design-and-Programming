DB01686 ( DB01686 ) induces vascular endothelium impairment and aggravates post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction in rats . DB01686 ( DB01686 ) is an endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) inhibitor recognized as an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and coronary heart diseases . This study investigated whether DB01686 ( 10 mg/kg day for 14 days ) affected endothelial function and aggravated post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction in the perfused rat heart . Systolic blood pressure and heart rate , plasma levels of DB01686 and nitrite/nitrate were measured in vehicle- and DB01686 -treated rats . Perfused hearts were submitted to global ischemia-reperfusion and vascular endothelial dysfunction was examined with angiotensin II in coronary vessels and aortic rings . Endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) and angiotensin-converting enzyme ( P12821 ) mRNA expression in aortic and cardiac tissues were measured . DB01686 -treated rats had higher systolic blood pressure ( 1.3-fold , P < 0.01 ) and slower heart rate ( 16 % , P < 0.05 ) than controls . Plasma DB01686 rose ( 1.9-fold , P < 0.01 ) and nitrite/nitrate concentration decreased 59 % ( P < 0.001 ) . Ventricular contraction ( stiffness ) increased significantly , with worsening of post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction . In preparations from DB01686 -treated rats the coronary vasculature 's response to angiotensin II was almost doubled ( P < 0.01 ) and the maximal vasorelaxant effect of acetylcholine in aortic rings was significantly lower than in preparations from vehicle-treated rats . In cardiac and aortic tissues P29474 mRNA and P12821 mRNA levels were similar in controls and DB01686 -treated rats . The increased plasma levels of DB01686 presumably cause endothelial dysfunction because of a deficiency in NO production , which also appears involved in the aggravation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury .
