High loading dose of clopidogrel is unable to satisfactorily inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with glycoprotein IIIA gene polymorphism : a genetic substudy of PRAGUE-8 trial . The study aimed to assess the impact of nine polymorphisms of genes encoding platelet receptors , enzymes , and hemostatic factors on clopidogrel efficacy to inhibit platelet reactivity in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective coronary angiography either with or without ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention . The study was performed as a genetic substudy of the PRAGUE-8 trial . Ninety-five patients pretreated with 600 mg clopidogrel at least 6 h prior to coronary angiography were tested . Baseline platelet reactivity to ADP was assessed before the drug was administered . DB00758 efficacy was tested again at 12 and 28 h after administration . Polymorphisms of platelet receptors , glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia ( 807C/T ) , Q9HCN6 ( 13254C/T ) , P05106 ( PlA1/PlA2 ) , P25116 ( IVSn-14A/T ) , Q9H244 ( 32C/T ) , Q9H244 ( H1/H2 ) haplotype , gene variations of cyclooxygenase-1 , Leiden , and factor II mutations were studied . Flow cytometric tests of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation states were used as a measure of drug efficacy . None of the gene polymorphisms influenced baseline ADP-induced platelet reactivity significantly . Twenty-eight hours after drug administration , differences in suppression of ADP-induced platelet reactivity were observed between polymorphism-positive and polymorphism-negative patients . Inhibition of platelet reactivity , after 600 mg of clopidogrel , was significantly less in carriers of PlA2 ( P=0.009 ) for mean decrease in platelet reactivity index . The proportion of clopidogrel nonresponders ( platelet reactivity index > 50 % ) was apparently higher in PlA2 carriers in comparison with PlA1/PlA1 patients ( 54 vs. 24 % , P=0.082 ) . A 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel failed to acceptably inhibit platelet reactivity in patients who were positive for the PlA2 polymorphism .
