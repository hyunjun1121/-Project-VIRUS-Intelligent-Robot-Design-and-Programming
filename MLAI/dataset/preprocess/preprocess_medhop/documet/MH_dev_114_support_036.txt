Intestinal antiinflammatory effect of DB00244 is dependent on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma . DB00244 ( DB00244 ) is an antiinflammatory drug widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases . It is known to inhibit the production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators , but the mechanism underlying the intestinal effects of DB00244 remains unknown . Based on the common activities of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) ligands and DB00244 , we hypothesized that this nuclear receptor mediates DB00244 therapeutic action . To test this possibility , colitis was induced in heterozygous P37231 (+/-) mice and their wild-type littermates , which were then treated with DB00244 . DB00244 treatment had a beneficial effect on colitis only in wild-type and not in heterozygous mice . In epithelial cells , DB00244 increased P37231 expression , promoted its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , and induced a modification of its conformation permitting the recruitment of coactivators and the activation of a peroxisome-proliferator response element-driven gene . Validation of these results was obtained with organ cultures of human colonic biopsies . These data identify P37231 as a target of DB00244 underlying antiinflammatory effects in the colon .
