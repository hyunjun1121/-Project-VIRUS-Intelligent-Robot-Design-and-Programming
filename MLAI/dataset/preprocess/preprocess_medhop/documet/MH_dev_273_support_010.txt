DB00107 attenuates NADPH-dependent superoxide activity and P05231 secretion in macrophages and vascular cells . DB00107 is synthesized and released in the heart and vasculature , tissues that also express oxytocin receptors . Although it has been established this intrinsic cardiovascular oxytocin system is important in normal homeostatic cardiac and vascular regulation , a role for this system in cardiovascular pathophysiology has not been investigated . The current study examined the influence of oxytocin on mechanisms in atherogenesis , oxidative stress , and inflammation in cultured human vascular cells , THP-1 monocytes , and macrophages . P30559 protein and mRNA expression , NADPH-dependent superoxide activity , and interleukin-6 secretion were measured . Results demonstrated oxytocin receptor protein and mRNA in THP-1 monocytes and macrophages . Incubation of cells at physiological levels of oxytocin significantly decreased basal and stimulated NADPH-dependent superoxide activity in vascular cells , monocytes , and macrophages by 24-48 % . DB00107 also attenuated interleukin-6 secretion from stimulated THP-1 macrophages and endothelial cells by 56 and 26 % , respectively . These findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates vascular oxidative stress and inflammation , two important pathophysiological processes in atherosclerosis . The fact that oxytocin receptors are found in monocytes and macrophages , and oxytocin decreases both superoxide production and release of a proinflammatory cytokine from these cells , suggests a potentially larger role for oxytocin in the attenuation of disease .
