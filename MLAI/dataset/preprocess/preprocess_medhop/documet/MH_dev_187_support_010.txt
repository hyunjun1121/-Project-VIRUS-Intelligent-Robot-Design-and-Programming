[(11)C]5-HTP and microPET are not suitable for pharmacodynamic studies in the rodent brain . The PET tracer [(11)C]5-hydroxytryptophan ( [(11)C]5-HTP ) , which is converted to [(11)C]5-hydroxytryptamine ( [(11)C]5-HT ) by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( P20711 ) , is thought to measure 5-HT synthesis rates . But can we measure these synthesis rates by kinetic modeling of [(11)C]5-HTP in rat ? Male rats were scanned with [(11)C]5-HTP ( 60 minutes ) after different treatments . Scans included arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis . 5-HT synthesis rates were calculated by a two-tissue compartment model ( 2TCM ) with irreversible tracer trapping or Patlak analysis . DB00190 ( inhibitor peripheral P20711 ) dose-dependently increased [(11)C]5-HTP brain uptake , but did not influence 2TCM parameters . Therefore , 10 mg/kg carbidopa was applied in all subsequent study groups . These groups included treatment with NSD 1015 ( general P20711 inhibitor ) or p-chlorophenylalanine ( PCPA , inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase , P17752 ) . In addition , the effect of a low-tryptophan ( DB00150 ) diet was investigated . NSD 1015 or DB00150 depletion did not affect any model parameters , but PCPA reduced [(11)C]5-HTP uptake , and the k3 . This was unexpected as NSD 1015 directly inhibits the enzyme converting [(11)C]5-HTP to [(11)C]5-HT , suggesting that trapping of radioactivity does not distinguish between parent tracer and its metabolites . As different results have been acquired in monkeys and humans , [(11)C]5-HTP-PET may be suitable for measuring 5-HT synthesis in primates , but not in rodents .
