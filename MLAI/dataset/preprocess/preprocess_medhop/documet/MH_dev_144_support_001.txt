A diarylheptanoid from lesser galangal ( Alpinia officinarum ) inhibits proinflammatory mediators via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase , Q8TCB0 /42 , and transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B . The diarylheptanoid 7-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylhept-4-en-3-one ( Q16891 ) is a naturally occurring phytochemical found in lesser galangal ( Alpinia officinarum ) . In the present study , we have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of this compound on mouse macrophage cell line ( RAW 264.7 ) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in vitro . Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with Q16891 ( 6.25-25 microM ) significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated nitric oxide ( NO ) production . This compound also inhibited the release of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) from human PB-MCs in vitro . In addition , Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that Q16891 decreased LPS-induced inducible nitric-oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) protein and mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells . Furthermore , Q16891 treatment also reduced nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) DNA binding induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells . To elucidate the molecular mechanism for inhibition of proinflammatory mediators by Q16891 ( 25 microM ) , we have studied the effect of Q16891 on LPS-induced p38 and Q8TCB0 /42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . We observed that the phosphorylation of Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was markedly inhibited by Q16891 , whereas activation of p38 MAPK was not affected . These results suggested that Q16891 from lesser galangal suppressed the LPS-induced production of NO , P01584 , and P01375 and expression of P35228 and P35354 gene expression by inhibiting NF-kappa B activation and phosphorylation of Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK .
