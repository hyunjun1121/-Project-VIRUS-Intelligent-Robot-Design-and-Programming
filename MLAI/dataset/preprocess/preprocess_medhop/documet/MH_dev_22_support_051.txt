Targeting of T lymphocytes to Neu/ P04626 -expressing cells using chimeric single chain Fv receptors . Cell surface molecules essential for the transformed phenotype or growth of malignant cells are attractive targets for anticancer immunotherapy . Antibodies specific to Neu/ P04626 , a human adenocarcinoma-associated growth factor receptor , were demonstrated to have tumor-inhibitory capacity . Yet , the inefficient accessibility of antibodies to solid tumors limits their clinical use . To redirect effector lymphocytes to adenocarcinomas , we constructed and functionally expressed in T cells chimeric single chain receptor genes incorporating both the Ag-binding domain of anti-Neu/ P04626 antibodies and the zeta-signal-transducing subunit of the TCR/CD3 complex or the gamma-signal-transducing subunit of the Ig Fc receptor complex . Surface expression of the anti-Neu/ P04626 chimeric genes in cytotoxic T cell hybridomas endowed them with specific Neu/ P04626 recognition enabling their activation for P60568 production and lysis of transformed cells overexpressing Neu/ P04626 . These chimeric genes hold promise for the immunotherapy of cancer .
