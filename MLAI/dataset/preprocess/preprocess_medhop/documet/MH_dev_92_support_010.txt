Bovine viral diarrhea viruses differentially alter the expression of the protein kinases and related proteins affecting the development of infection and anti-viral mechanisms in bovine monocytes . Using a proteomics approach , we evaluated the effect of cytopathic ( cp ) , and non-cytopathic ( ncp ) bovine viral diarrhea viruses ( BVDV ) on the expression of protein kinases and related proteins in bovine monocytes . Proteins were isolated from membrane and cytosolic fractions with the differential detergent fractionation ( DDF ) method and identified with 2D-LC P19957 P78325 . Of approximately 10,000 proteins identified , 378 proteins had homology with known protein kinases or related proteins . Eighteen proteins involved in cell differentiation and activation , migration , anti-viral mechanisms ( interferon/apoptosis ) , biosynthesis , sugar metabolism and oncogenic transformation were significantly altered in BVDV-infected monocytes compared to the uninfected controls . Six proteins , mostly related to cell migration , anti-viral mechanisms , sugar metabolism and possibly tumor resistance were differentially expressed between the ncp and cp BVDV-infected monocytes . Particularly , the expression of the receptor of activated C kinase ( RACK ) , of pyridoxal kinase ( PK ) , diacyglycerol kinase ( Q16854 ) and Brutons tyrosine kinase ( Q06187 ) was decreased in monocytes infected with cp BVDV compared to ncp BVDV , possibly contributing to the cytopathic effect of the virus . This and other findings are discussed in view of the possible role the identified proteins play in the development of viral infection and oncogenic transformation of cells .
