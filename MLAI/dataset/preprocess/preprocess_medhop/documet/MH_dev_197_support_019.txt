Epstein-Barr virus Zta-induced immunomodulators from nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells upregulate interleukin-10 production from monocytes . During lytic infection with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , several viral lytic proteins function to evade immune recognition or to actively suppress immune cells . An EBV lytic transactivator , Zta , induces an immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin 10 ( P22301 ) in B cells , but whether it regulates P22301 in the context of epithelial cells is unclear . In this study , we tested nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cell lines and found that Zta did not induce P22301 in these epithelial cells . Interestingly , the conditioned medium of Zta-expressing NPC cells enhanced P22301 production from monocytes . We further revealed that the P22301 -inducing effect involved at least two immunomodulators that were upregulated by Zta and secreted from NPC cells : granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) . Zta was recruited to and activated the GM- P04141 promoter , thus upregulating GM- P04141 expression . Zta also activated the promoter of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , and Zta-induced P35354 increased downstream PGE(2) production . Cotreatment with GM- P04141 and PGE(2) synergistically induced P22301 production from monocytes . The P22301 -inducing effect of the Zta-conditioned medium was reduced when GM- P04141 or the P35354 /PGE(2) pathway was blocked . The conditioned medium of NPC cells with EBV lytic infection showed a similar increase of GM- P04141 and PGE(2) levels as well as the P22301 -inducing effect on monocytes , and knockdown of Zta abolished all the effects . Therefore , through Zta-induced immunomodulators , EBV lytic infection in NPC cells can direct bystander monocytes to produce P22301 , which may be a novel way of EBV to promote local immunosuppression .
