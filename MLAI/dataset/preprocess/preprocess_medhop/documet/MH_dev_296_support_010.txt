House dust mite major allergen Der f 1 enhances proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression in a cell line of canine epidermal keratinocytes . House dust mite ( HDM ) allergens are the most common allergens involved in the induction of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity . Recently , epicutaneous sensitization with HDM allergens has been emphasized in the development of atopic dermatitis ( AD ) ; however , direct stimulation of canine keratinocytes by mite allergens has not been well investigated . In the present study , we investigated the effects of Der f 1 , a major allergen of Dermatophagoides farinae , on cytokine and chemokine gene expression in a canine keratinocyte cell line , CPEK . CPEK constitutively expressed mRNA for P01375 , IL-12p35 , Q14116 , GM- P04141 , TGF-beta , P10145 / P10145 , Q92583 / Q92583 , Q9Y4X3 / Q9Y4X3 and Q9NRJ3 / Q9NRJ3 . Of all the cytokines and chemokines investigated in CPEK , transcription levels of GM- P04141 , P10145 / P10145 and P01375 mRNA were significantly enhanced by stimulation with Der f 1 . The present results suggest that Der f 1 can directly augment inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production from keratinocytes , and may initiate allergic inflammation independently of Type-I hypersensitivity .
