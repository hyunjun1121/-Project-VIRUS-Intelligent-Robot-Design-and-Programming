Immunization strategies to augment oral vaccination with DNA and viral vectors expressing HIV envelope glycoprotein . Induction of mucosal immunity to the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) envelope ( env ; gp160 ) glycoprotein has been demonstrated with orally administered recombinant vaccinia virus ( rVV ) vectors and poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) ( P00747 ) -encapsulated plasmid DNA expressing gp160 . In this study , we investigated the effect of an oral DNA-prime/rVV-boost vaccine regimen in conjunction with adjuvants on the level of gp160-specific cellular and humoral responses in BALB/c mice . We demonstrated that DNA priming followed by a booster with rVV expressing gp160 ( vPE16 ) significantly augmented env-specific immunity in systemic and mucosal tissues of the immunized mice . Association of vPE16 with liposomes and coadministration of liposome-associated beta-glucan lentinan or P60568 /Ig-encoded plasmid DNA-encapsulated in P00747 microparticles triggered the optimal cell-mediated immune ( CMI ) responses . Lentinan was found to increase env-specific type 1 cytokine production and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) activities but had no effect on humoral responses . On the other hand , P60568 /Ig-mediated increases in both type 1 and 2 activities were associated with higher levels of env-specific CTL and antibody responses . Results of these studies demonstrated the effectiveness of oral vaccines with DNA and rVV vectors in conjunction with immunomodulators in inducing specific immune responses in systemic and mucosal tissues .
