Regulation of phosphodiesterase-4 ( DB05876 ) expression in mouse brain by repeated antidepressant treatment : comparison with rolipram . Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase-4 ( DB05876 ) is a component of signaling pathways involved in the mediation of antidepressant activity . Of the four DB05876 subtypes , Q08499 appears to be of particular importance , given the finding that Q08499 -deficient mice exhibit an antidepressant-like behavioral phenotype . In mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex , the effects of repeated treatment with the antidepressants desipramine and fluoxetine or the DB05876 inhibitor rolipram on the expression of Q08499 was compared to that of P27815 and Q07343 , the other two subtypes expressed in the brain . Expression of Q08499 was increased by all drugs tested , with the exception of desipramine in hippocampus . By contrast , these treatments affected P27815 and Q07343 expression differentially . In hippocampus , antidepressants increased P27815 and decreased Q07343 , whereas ROL decreased P27815 and did not change Q07343 . In cerebral cortex , antidepressants increased P27815 and did not change Q07343 , whereas ROL did not change P27815 and increased Q07343 . 3H- DB01954 binding was increased in cytosolic , but not in membrane , fractions of cerebral cortex by all drugs tested ; there were no changes observed in hippocampus . Overall , the present results suggest some species-dependence of the regulation of DB05876 subtypes , based on data obtained previously using rats . They also suggest that the Q08499 subtype may be of particular importance as an antidepressant target in that it is regulated by repeated treatment with both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors as well as by the DB05876 inhibitor rolipram , drugs that produce antidepressant effects via different neuropharmacological mechanisms .
