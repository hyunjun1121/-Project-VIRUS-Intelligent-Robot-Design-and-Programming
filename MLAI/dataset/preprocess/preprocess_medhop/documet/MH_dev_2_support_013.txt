Selective estrogen receptor modulation influences atherosclerotic plaque composition in a rabbit menopause model . OBJECTIVE : Osteoporosis trials suggest raloxifene decreased cardiovascular events in women with pre-existing atherosclerosis . We assessed the hypothesis that selective estrogen receptor modulation induces plaque stability in " menopausal " animals . METHODS AND RESULTS : Atherosclerosis was induced in 42 ovariectomized New Zealand white rabbits by cholesterol feeding and mechanical injury . Animals were imaged by magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) for baseline atherosclerosis , and randomized to control ( OVX ( ovariectomized control group ) , n=12 ) , raloxifene 35-60 mg/kg/day by diet admixture ( RLX ( raloxifene therapy group ) , n=24 ) , or immediate sacrifice ( n=6 ) for immunohistopathologic correlation of Q9BWK5 . Six months later , rabbits underwent repeat Q9BWK5 then sacrifice for micro-computed tomography ( microCT ) and molecular analysis . Unlike OVX , RLX reduced atheroma volume . Analysis for lesion inflammation revealed reductions in P35354 ( cyclooxygenase-2 ) , P03956 ( matrix metalloproteinase-1 ) , P13500 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) expression and macrophage infiltration in RLX versus OVX with concomitant upregulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). microCT showed similar total vascular calcification between groups , but calcifications in RLX were less nodular with better radial organization ( mean calcific arc angle 63+/-7 degrees versus 33+/-6 degrees in OVX ) , the predicted result of a 53 % increase in P12643 ( bone-morphogenetic protein-2 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Raloxifene treatment results in reduced lesion volume , enhanced mechanical stability of vascular calcification , and less inflamed lesions characterized by less macrophage infiltration and reduced P35354 , P03956 and P13500 expression .
