Regulation of male fertility by P13569 and implications in male infertility . BACKGROUND : The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) is a DB02527 -activated Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) conducting channel , mutations of which are known to be associated with male infertility . However , the underlying mechanisms remain elusive . METHODS : Literature databases were searched for papers on the topics related to P13569 and male fertility and infertility with relevant keywords . Unpublished data from authors ' laboratory were also included for analysis . RESULTS : Clinical evidence shows increased mutation frequency or reduced P13569 expression in men with congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens ( CBAVD ) or sperm abnormalities , such as azoospermia teratospermia and oligoasthenospermia . Studies on primary rodent Sertoli cells and germ cells , as well as testes from P13569 knockout mice or a cryptorchidism model , yield findings indicating the involvement of P13569 in spermatogensis through the HCO(3)(-)/ Q96PN6 / DB02527 /CREB( Q03060 ) pathway and the NF-ÎºB/ P35354 /PGE(2) pathway . Evidence also reveals a critical role of P13569 in sperm capacitation by directly or indirectly mediating HCO(3)(-) entry that is essential for capacitation . P13569 is emerging as a versatile player with roles in mediating different signaling pathways pertinent to various reproductive processes , in addition to its long-recognized role in electrolyte and fluid transport that regulates the luminal microenvironment of the male reproductive tract . CONCLUSIONS : P13569 is a key regulator of male fertility , a defect of which may result in different forms of male infertility other than CBAVD . It would be worthwhile to further investigate the potential of developing novel diagnostic and contraceptive methods targeting P13569 .
