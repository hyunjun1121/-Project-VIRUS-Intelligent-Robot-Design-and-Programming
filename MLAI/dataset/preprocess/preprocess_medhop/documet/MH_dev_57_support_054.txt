O95750 promotes progression of prostate cancer . BACKGROUND : Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signaling pathways have been reported to play important roles in prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression . O95750 is one of a subfamily of FGFs that circulate in serum and act in an endocrine manner . Our objective was to investigate its role in the progression of PCa . METHODS : The effect of O95750 on the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LNCaP and PC3 cells was examined using MTT assay and Western blotting . Serum concentration of O95750 was measured by ELISA in 209 patients with PCa , and the association between clinicopathological features and the presence of O95750 -positive cells in tissues derived from 155 patients who undergone radical prostatectomy was investigated . RESULTS : Under androgen-deprived conditions achieved by incubation in medium with O95750 , the expression of P19022 in LNCaP cells was enhanced , that of P12830 and caspase 3 was suppressed , and the viability of LNCaP and PC3 cells was significantly enhanced . Significantly higher levels of PSA were recorded in the group determined by immunohistochemistry staining to be O95750 -positive ( P = 0.0046 ) . The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate after radical prostatectomy was 46.4 % in the O95750 -positive group and 70.0 % in the O95750 -negative group ( P = 0.0027 ) . In multivariate analysis , the presence of O95750 -positive tissues was an independent factor for worse prognosis after radical prostatectomy ( P = 0.0052 ) . Serum O95750 levels in high Gleason grade group were higher than that in low Gleason grade group ( P = 0.0009 ) . CONCLUSIONS : O95750 might be associated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy by promoting cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PCa .
