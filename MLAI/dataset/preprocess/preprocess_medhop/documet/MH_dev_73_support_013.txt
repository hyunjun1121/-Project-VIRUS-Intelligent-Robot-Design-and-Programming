Inhibition of endocannabinoid neuronal uptake and hydrolysis as strategies for developing anxiolytic drugs . The endocannabinoid system comprises the P21554 and CB2 receptors ( the targets of the Cannabis sativa compound DB00470 ) , the endogenous ligands ( endocannabinoids ) arachidonoyl ethanolamide ( anandamide ) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol , their synthesizing machinery and membrane transport system , and the hydrolyzing enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) and monoacylglycerol lipase ( Q99685 ) , respectively . The endocannabinoids may act on demand to confer protection against aversive stimuli , which suggests that increasing their brain levels may represent an approach for treatment of anxiety-related disorders . Thus , this article reviews the profile of endocannabinoid reuptake and hydrolysis inhibitors in experimental tests predictive of anxiolytic activity . The FAAH inhibitors and the blockers of anandamide transport , in contrast to direct P21554 receptor agonists , induce anxiolytic effects at doses that do not interfere with motor activity . Q99685 inhibitors also reduce anxiety-like behavior , although they are more likely to impair motor activity . Regarding their mechanisms , increasing anandamide levels induce responses mediated by the P21554 receptor and occluded by the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 channels , whereas the effects of increasing 2-arachidonoyl glycerol depend on both P21554 and CB2 receptors . Their neuroanatomical targets include various structures related to anxiety and fear responses . Understanding the pharmacological properties of FAAH and Q99685 inhibitors may contribute toward the development of new anxiolytic interventions based on the endocannabinoid system .
