P00533 ( P00533 ) transactivation by estrogen via the G-protein-coupled receptor , Q99527 : a novel signaling pathway with potential significance for breast cancer . The biological and biochemical effects of estrogen have been ascribed to its known receptors , which function as ligand-inducible transcription factors . However , estrogen also triggers rapid activation of classical second messengers ( DB02527 , calcium , and inositol triphosphate ) and stimulation of intracellular signaling cascades mitogen-activated protein kinase ( Q96HU1 K ) , PI3K and P29474 . These latter events are commonly activated by membrane receptors that either possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity or couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins . We have shown that estrogen transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) to Q96HU1 K signaling axis via the G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , Q99527 , through the release of surface-bound proHB- P01133 from estrogen receptor ( ER ) -negative human breast cancer cells [ Molecular Endocrinology 14 ( 2000 ) 1649 ] . This finding is consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that transactivation of EGFRs by GPCRs is a recurrent theme in cell signaling . GPCR-mediated transactivation of EGFRs by estrogen provides a previously unappreciated mechanism of cross-talk between estrogen and serum growth factors , and explains prior data reporting the P01133 -like effects of estrogen . This novel mechanism by which estrogen activates growth factor-dependent signaling and its implications for breast cancer biology are discussed further in this review .
