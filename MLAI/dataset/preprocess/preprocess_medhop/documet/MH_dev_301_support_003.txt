DB08896 ( DB08896 ) : a new oral multikinase inhibitor of angiogenic , stromal and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases with potent preclinical antitumor activity . Angiogenesis , a critical driver of tumor development , is controlled by interconnected signaling pathways . Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) 2 and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 play crucial roles in the biology of normal and tumor vasculature . DB08896 ( DB08896 ) , a novel oral multikinase inhibitor , potently inhibits these endothelial cell kinases in biochemical and cellular kinase phosphorylation assays . Furthermore , regorafenib inhibits additional angiogenic kinases ( P17948 /3 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ) and the mutant oncogenic kinases P10721 , P07949 and B-RAF . The antiangiogenic effect of regorafenib was demonstrated in vivo by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging . DB08896 administered once orally at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased the extravasation of Gadomer in the vasculature of rat GS9L glioblastoma tumor xenografts . In a daily (qd)×4 dosing study , the pharmacodynamic effects persisted for 48 hr after the last dosing and correlated with tumor growth inhibition ( TGI ) . A significant reduction in tumor microvessel area was observed in a human colorectal xenograft after qd×5 dosing at 10 and 30 mg/kg . DB08896 exhibited potent dose-dependent TGI in various preclinical human xenograft models in mice , with tumor shrinkages observed in breast MDA-MB-231 and renal 786-O carcinoma models . Pharmacodynamic analyses of the breast model revealed strong reduction in staining of proliferation marker Ki-67 and phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 . These data demonstrate that regorafenib is a well-tolerated , orally active multikinase inhibitor with a distinct target profile that may have therapeutic benefit in human malignancies .
