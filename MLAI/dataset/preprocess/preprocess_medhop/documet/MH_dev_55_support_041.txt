Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma stimulates the growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible 153 gene in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells . Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma by the thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) class of antidiabetic drugs elicits growth inhibition in a variety of malignant tumors . We clarified the effects of TZDs on growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) cells that express endogenous P37231 . DB00197 and pioglitazone caused inhibition of cellular growth and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner . Subtraction cloning analysis identified that troglitazone stimulated expression of the growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible (GADD)153 gene , and the increased expression of P35638 mRNA was also confirmed by an array analysis of the 160 apoptosis-related genes . Western blot analysis revealed that troglitazone also increased P35638 protein levels in a time-dependent manner . DB00197 did not stimulate P35638 mRNA levels in undifferentiated 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells lacking P37231 expression , whereas its induction was clearly observed in differentiated adipocytes expressing P37231 . Activity of the P35638 promoter occurred in a NSCLC cell line in transient transcription assays and was significantly stimulated by troglitazone , although binding of Q07869 /retinoid X receptor heterodimer was not detected in the promoter region in gel retardation assays . Inhibition of P35638 gene expression by an antisense phosphorothionate oligonucleotide attenuated the troglitazone-induced growth inhibition . These findings collectively indicated that activation of P37231 by TZDs could cause growth inhibition and apoptosis of NSCLC cells and that P35638 might be a candidate factor implicated in these processes .
