Modulation of GSK-3β activity in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection . Alphaviruses , including Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus ( VEEV ) , cause disease in both equine and humans that exhibit overt encephalitis in a significant percentage of cases . Features of the host immune response and tissue-specific responses may contribute to fatal outcomes as well as the development of encephalitis . It has previously been shown that VEEV infection of mice induces transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines genes ( e.g. , IFN-γ , P05231 , IL-12 , P35228 and P01375 -α ) within 6 h . GSK-3β is a host protein that is known to modulate pro-inflammatory gene expression and has been a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's . Hence inhibition of GSK-3β in the context of encephalitic viral infections has been useful in a neuroprotective capacity . Small molecule GSK-3β inhibitors and GSK-3β siRNA experiments indicated that GSK-3β was important for VEEV replication . Thirty-eight second generation BIO derivatives were tested and BIOder was found to be the most potent inhibitor , with an IC(50) of ∼0.5 µM and a CC(50) of > 100 µM . BIOder was a more potent inhibitor of GSK-3β than BIO , as demonstrated through in vitro kinase assays from uninfected and infected cells . Size exclusion chromatography experiments demonstrated that GSK-3β is found in three distinct complexes in VEEV infected cells , whereas GSK-3β is only present in one complex in uninfected cells . Cells treated with BIOder demonstrated an increase in the anti-apoptotic gene , survivin , and a decrease in the pro-apoptotic gene , P55957 , suggesting that modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes contributes to the protective effect of BIOder treatment . Finally , BIOder partially protected mice from VEEV induced mortality . Our studies demonstrate the utility of GSK-3β inhibitors for modulating VEEV infection .
