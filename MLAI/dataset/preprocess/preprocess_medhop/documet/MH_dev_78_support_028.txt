DB00945 resistance in coronary artery disease is correlated to elevated markers for oxidative stress but not to the expression of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) 1/2 , a novel P23219 polymorphism or the PlA(1/2) polymorphism . DB00945 resistance ( AR ) is estimated to be present in 5-75 % of patients and is related to increased cardiovascular mortality . However , the underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown . In the present study , AR was detected in 14 out of 55 patients ( 25 % ) with coronary artery disease . The presence of concomitant anti-inflammatory drugs did not affect AR . Plasma levels of thromboxane B(2) as well as the markers for oxidative stress and known platelet activators 8-isoprostane and lipid peroxidation products were significantly higher in aspirin-resistant individuals ( 349.3 pg/ml , 53.9 pg/ml , and 538 micromol/l ) compared to controls ( 113.7 pg/ml , 10.3 pg/ml , and 32.2 micromol/l ; P < 0.05 , respectively ) . Platelet cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) and P35354 mRNA and protein expression were without significant differences between the two groups . DNA sequencing detected a novel platelet P23219 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) resulting in amino acid exchange at position 8 ( Arg8/Trp8 ) . The wild-type as well as the heterozygous and homozygous SNP were present in both patient groups without significant differences . The aspirin binding ( Arg120 ) and acetylation site ( Ser529 ) were unaffected in the samples tested . Neither was AR related to the platelet integrin PlA(1)/A(2) polymorphism . In conclusion , AR appears to be unrelated to differences in platelet P23219 and P35354 expression or to a novel platelet P23219 SNP and the PlA(1)/A(2) SNP . However , a correlation exists to elevated eicosanoids generated by oxidative stress indicating P23219 -independent pathways for the generation of platelet activating molecules represent a potential cause for AR .
