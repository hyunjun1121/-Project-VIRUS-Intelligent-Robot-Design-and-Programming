Emergence of polyclonal P36888 tyrosine kinase domain mutations during sequential therapy with sorafenib and sunitinib in P36888 -ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia . PURPOSE : To evaluate the clinical activity of sequential therapy with sorafenib and sunitinib in P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) -internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) -positive acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) and monitor the emergence of secondary P36888 tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD ) mutations during treatment . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Six children with relapsed/refractory AML were treated with sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine , followed by single-agent sorafenib if not a candidate for transplantation . DB01268 was initiated after sorafenib relapse . Bone marrow samples were obtained for assessment of P36888 TKD mutations by deep amplicon sequencing . The phase of secondary mutations with ITD alleles was assessed by cloning and sequencing of P36888 exons 14 through 20 . Identified mutations were modeled in Ba/ P13726 cells , and the effect of kinase inhibitors on P36888 signaling and cell viability was assessed . RESULTS : Four patients achieved complete remission , but 3 receiving maintenance therapy with sorafenib relapsed after 14 to 37 weeks . DB01268 reduced circulating blasts in two patients and marrow blasts in one . Two patients did not respond to sorafenib combination therapy or sunitinib . P36888 mutations at residues D835 and F691 were observed in sorafenib resistance samples on both ITD-positive and -negative alleles . Deep sequencing revealed low-level mutations and their evolution during sorafenib treatment . DB01268 suppressed leukemic clones with D835H and F691L mutations , but not D835Y . Cells expressing sorafenib-resistant P36888 mutations were sensitive to sunitinib in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : DB01268 has activity in patients that are resistant to sorafenib and harbor secondary P36888 TKD mutations . The use of sensitive methods to monitor P36888 mutations during therapy may allow individualized treatment with the currently available kinase inhibitors .
