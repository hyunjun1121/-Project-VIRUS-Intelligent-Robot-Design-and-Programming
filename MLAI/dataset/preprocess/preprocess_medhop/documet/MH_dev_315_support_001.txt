Update on the genetics characterization of vitiligo . Vitiligo is an autoimmune skin disorder in which autoimmune-mediated destruction of melanocytes caused depigmentation of skin patches . The complex genetics of vitiligo involves multiple susceptibility loci , genetic heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions . In order to clarify the genetic factors , two different principal approaches have applied for the identification of genomic regions or candidate genes that mediate susceptibility to vitiligo . First approach is the genome-wide linkage analyses , which is conducted by scanning of entire human genome for genomic regions that are linked to the development of vitiligo . The other approach is functional candidate gene association ( FCGA ) analyses that detect specific candidate genes , which are expected to involve in disease on the basis of their priori biological functions . Genomic-wide scans have provided a strong support for vitiligo susceptibility genes on chromosomes 4q13-q21 , 1p31 , 7q22 , 8p12 and 17p13 , while loci of interest at 6p , 6q , 14q , 9q , 13q , 19p and 22q required further follow-up . Whereas , FCGA studies have identified some candidate genes which are associated with vitiligo , such as HLA , O43918 , Q86XK2 , CAT , Q9UJU5 , P03372 , P21964 , Q9Y2R2 , Q9C000 , P16234 , MYG1 , O75030 , CD117 , P17861 , FAS , P35354 , P05305 and P12821 , but few of them reports now appear to be false-positive . This review will provides an update on genetics of vitiligo based on the identification of novel candidate genes that represent , in my opinion as optimal utility for future therapeutic targets in the pathogenesis of vitiligo .
