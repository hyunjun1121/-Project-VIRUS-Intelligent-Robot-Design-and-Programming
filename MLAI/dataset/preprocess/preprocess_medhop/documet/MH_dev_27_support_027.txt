DB00087 induction and triple maintenance immunotherapy in kidney transplantation from donors after cardiac death . We have used alemtuzumab in combination with triple maintenance immunosuppression in renal transplantation from donors after cardiac death between 2002 and 2006 . We compared outcomes of induction therapy with alemtuzumab with interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) receptor antagonists ( RA ) and anti-lymphocyte antibodies . We used a retrospective sequential study design to examine 170 recipients of kidneys from donor after cardiac death ( P81605 ) for survival , graft survival , time to first rejection , glomerular filtration and complications . Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the following criteria : panel of reactive antibodies > 20 % , retransplants , Afro-American race . Induction with alemtuzumab was compared with anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) in the high-risk and with IL-2RA in the low-risk group . Patients received triple immunosuppression with steroids , mycophenolate mofetil and calcineurin inhibitors . Patient survival , graft survival , rejection rate and glomerular filtration rate did not significantly differ between patients treated with alemtuzumab versus IL-2RAs or ATG . There was a trend towards reduced graft- and patient survival in the alemtuzumab group . There was an increased incidence of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infections in the alemtuzumab-induced group and a trend towards increased BK virus and bacterial infections . Induction of P81605 kidney transplants with alemtuzumab compared to IL-2RA and ATG has no significant impact on acute rejection . It appears however that CMV infections are increased in patients induced with alemtuzumab . We therefore conclude that induction with alemtuzumab does not confer any advantage over traditional induction agents .
