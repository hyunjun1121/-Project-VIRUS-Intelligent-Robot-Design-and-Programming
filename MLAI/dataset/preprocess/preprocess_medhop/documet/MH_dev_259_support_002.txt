P08235 antagonizes Dot1a-Af9 complex to increase αENaC transcription . DB04630 is a major regulator of Na(+) absorption and acts by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) to stimulate the epithelial Na(+) channel ( ENaC ) . MR(-/-) mice exhibited pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 ( hyponatremia , hyperkalemia , salt wasting , and high levels of aldosterone ) and died around postnatal day 10 . However , if and how MR regulates ENaC transcription remain incompletely understood . Our earlier work demonstrated that aldosterone activates αENaC transcription by reducing expression of Dot1a and Af9 and by impairing Dot1a-Af9 interaction . Most recently , we reported identification of a major Af9 binding site in the αENaC promoter and upregulation of αENaC mRNA expression in mouse kidneys lacking Dot1a . Despite these findings , the putative antagonism between the MR/aldosterone and Dot1a-Af9 complexes has never been addressed . The molecular defects leading to PHA-1 in MR(-/-) mice remain elusive . Here , we report that MR competes with Dot1a to bind Af9 . MR/aldosterone and Dot1a-Af9 complexes mutually counterbalance ENaC mRNA expression in inner medullary collecting duct 3 ( IMCD3 ) cells . Real-time RT-quantitative PCR revealed that 5-day-old MR(-/-) vs. MR(+/+) mice had significantly lower αENaC mRNA levels . This change was associated with an increased Af9 binding and H3 Q5XKE5 hypermethylation in the αENaC promoter . Therefore , this study identified MR as a novel binding partner and regulator of Af9 and a novel mechanism coupling MR-mediated activation with relief of Dot1a-Af9-mediated repression via MR-Af9 interaction . Impaired ENaC expression due to failure to inhibit Dot1a-Af9 may play an important role in the early stages of PHA-1 ( before postnatal day 8 ) in MR(-/-) mice .
