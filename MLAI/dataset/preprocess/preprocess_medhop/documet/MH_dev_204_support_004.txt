Comparison of effects of a range of 5-HT receptor modulators on consumption and preference for a sweetened ethanol solution in rats . This study assessed the effects of a range of serotonergic agents on preference for a slightly sweetened ethanol solution ( 10 % ethanol , 3 % glucose ) in rats . A two-bottle , free-choice paradigm was used following induction of ethanol consumption . The model used provides a robust and reliable level of ethanol self-administration in normal laboratory rats . DB00898 consumption was significantly and selectively reduced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A ( P08908 ) full agonist 8-OH-DPAT ( 0.3-1.0 mg/kg ) and the 5- Q9H205 antagonist granisetron ( 0.1-1.0 mg/kg ) . Non-specific reductions in fluid consumption were induced by the P28222 agonist RU 24969 ( 0.1-1.0mg/kg ) and the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin ( 1.0-6.0 mg/kg ) . These studies thus confirm the potential for decreasing ethanol consumption and ethanol preference of P08908 agonists and 5- Q9H205 antagonists , but failed to find any selective effects for agents acting at P28222 or 5-HT2 receptors .
