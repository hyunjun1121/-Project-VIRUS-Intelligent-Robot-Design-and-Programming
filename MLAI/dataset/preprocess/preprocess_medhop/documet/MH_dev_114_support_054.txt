Effects of sulfasalazine and a sulfasalazine analogue on the formation of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products . A sulfasalazine analogue , 5'-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)2'-hydroxyphenylacetic acid ( CL 42A ) , potently inhibited the formation of P09917 products ( leukotrienes B4 and C4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ) by human leukocytes . Half-maximal inhibition of leukotriene production was obtained with 5 and 10 microM CL 42A after stimulation with serum-treated zymosan or ionophore A23187 , respectively . CL 42A was equipotent to nordihydroguaiaretic acid and about 50 times more potent than sulfasalazine and benoxaprofen in studies on the inhibition of LTB4 formation in leukocyte suspensions stimulated with serum-treated zymosan . Furthermore , CL 42A had no inhibitory effect on the production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid after incubation of human leukocytes with ionophore A23187 in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid . Sulfasalazine inhibited the synthesis of P09917 products ( 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene B4 : IC50 250 microM , leukotriene C4 : IC50 100 microM ) in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation . The metabolites of sulfasalazine , sulfapyridine and DB00244 , and the isomer , DB00233 , were all less potent than sulfasalazine as inhibitors of leukotriene formation . Both CL 42A ( IC50 20 microM ) and sulfasalazine ( IC50 500 microM ) inhibited the synthesis of thromboxane B2 and hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid in human platelet suspensions after arachidonic acid stimulation . However , while CL 42A inhibited cyclooxygenase , the inhibitory effect of sulfasalazine was exerted mainly on thromboxane synthase . The platelet formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was not inhibited by CL 42A whereas sulfasalazine had a weak inhibitory effect .
