DB00197 suppresses transforming growth factor-beta1-induced collagen type I expression in keloid fibroblasts . BACKGROUND : Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) -gamma agonists are increasingly used in patients with diabetes and some studies have suggested a beneficial effect on organ fibrosis . However their effects on dermal fibrosis in keloids are unknown . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effect of the P37231 agonist troglitazone on transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1-induced collagen type I expression in keloid fibroblasts . METHODS : Keloid fibroblasts were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of troglitazone in the presence of TGF-beta1 . The mRNA expression of P37231 was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . The protein of P37231 , Q15796 , P84022 , phoshpo- Q15796 /3 and collagen type I was determined by Western blotting and collagen synthesis was evaluated by measuring (3)H-proline incorporation . The effect of troglitazone on cell viability was evaluated by the colorimetric conversion of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide . RESULTS : P37231 was expressed at a moderate level in keloid fibroblasts . DB00197 depressed TGF-beta1-stimulated collagen type I expression and collagen synthesis in keloid fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner . Moreover , troglitazone inhibited expression and phosphorylation of TGF-beta1-induced Q15796 /3 . Cell viability was unaffected . These inhibitory effects of troglitazone were reversed by the P37231 -specific antagonist GW9662 . CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that P37231 is present in keloid fibroblasts and P37231 activation inhibits TGF-beta1-induced collagen type I expression at least in part by decreasing collagen synthesis . P37231 may be a promising therapeutic target for keloids .
