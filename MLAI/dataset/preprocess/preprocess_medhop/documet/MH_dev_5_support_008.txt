IL-1 transcriptionally activates the neutrophil chemotactic factor/ P10145 gene in endothelial cells . Leucocytes and vascular cells interact closely in inflammation and immunity and cytokines are important mediators of this interaction . The present study was designed to define the capacity of human endothelial cells ( O14777 ) to produce a monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor ( provisionally termed P10145 ) . P10145 is a polypeptide chemotactic for neutrophils originally identified in the culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated monocytes . IL-1 induced high levels of production of neutrophil chemotactic activity in culture supernatants of O14777 . Optimal stimulation of activity was observed when O14777 were cultured with 10-100 ng/ml P01584 for 16 hr . Anti- P10145 antibody blocked the chemotactic activity for neutrophils of IL-1-activated O14777 supernatants . IL-1-treated O14777 expressed high levels of P10145 mRNA transcripts , as assessed by Northern blot analysis . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) and LPS , unlike the inflammatory monokine P05231 , also induced P10145 expression . Nuclear run-off experiments revealed that IL-1 activated transcription of the P10145 gene . The production of P10145 may represent a mechanism whereby endothelial cells , exposed to inflammatory signals , participate in the regulation of neutrophil extravasation .
