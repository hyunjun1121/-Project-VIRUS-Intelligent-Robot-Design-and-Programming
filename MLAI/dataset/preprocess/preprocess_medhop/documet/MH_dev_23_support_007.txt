DB01169 ( ATO ) and Q02750 inhibition synergize to induce apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells . Recent studies suggest that components of the prosurvival signal transduction pathways involving the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) can confer an aggressive , apoptosis-resistant phenotype to leukemia cells . In this study , we report that acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells exploit the Ras-MAPK activation pathway to phosphorylate at Ser112 and to inactivate the proapoptotic protein Bad , delaying arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) -induced apoptosis . Both in APL cell line NB4 and in APL primary blasts , the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) and Bad phosphorylation by Q02750 inhibitors enhanced apoptosis in ATO-treated cells . We isolated an arsenic-resistant NB4 subline ( NB4-As(R) ) , which showed stronger P27361 /2 activity ( 2.7-fold increase ) and Bad phosphorylation ( 2.4-fold increase ) compared to parental NB4 cells in response to ATO treatment . Upon ATO exposure , both NB4 and NB4-As(R) cell lines doubled protein levels of the death antagonist Bcl-xL , but the amount of free Bcl-xL that did not heterodimerize with Bad was 1.8-fold greater in NB4-As(R) than in the parental line . Q02750 inhibitors dephosphorylated Bad and inhibited the ATO-induced increase of Bcl-xL , overcoming ATO resistance in NB4-As(R) . These results may provide a rationale to develop combined or sequential Q02750 inhibitors plus ATO therapy in this clinical setting .
