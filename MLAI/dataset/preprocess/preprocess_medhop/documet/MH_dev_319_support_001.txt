DB00158 and thiamine transporters mediated by facilitative carriers ( P41440 -3 and Q96NT5 ) and folate receptors . The reduced folate carrier ( P41440 , P41440 ) , thiamine transporter-1 ( O60779 , O60779 ) and thiamine transporter-2 ( Q9BZV2 , Q9BZV2 ) evolved from the same family of solute carriers . P41440 transports folates but not thiamine . O60779 and Q9BZV2 transport thiamine but not folates . P41440 and O60779 deliver their substrates to systemic tissues ; Q9BZV2 mediates intestinal thiamine absorption . The proton-coupled folate transporter ( Q96NT5 , Q96NT5 ) is the mechanism by which folates are absorbed across the apical-brush-border membrane of the proximal small intestine . Two folate receptors ( P15328 and P14207 ) mediate folate transport across epithelia by an endocytic process . DB00158 transporters are routes of delivery of drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases . There are autosomal recessive disorders associated with mutations in genes encoded for Q96NT5 ( hereditary folate malabsorption ) , P15328 ( cerebral folate deficiency ) , O60779 ( thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia ) , and Q9BZV2 ( biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease ) .
