DB11320 Promotes the Release of P05231 via the P35367 /p38 and NF-κB Pathways in Nasal Fibroblasts . PURPOSE : Based on the close relationship between histamine and interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) , we hypothesized that histamine may regulate the production of cytokines , such as P05231 , during allergic inflammation . Here , we examined the role of histamine in P05231 production and histamine receptor activity in nasal fibroblasts , along with the mechanisms underlying these effects . METHODS : Experiments were performed using nasal fibroblasts from 8 normal patients . RT-PCR was used to identify the major histamine receptors expressed in nasal fibroblasts . Fibroblasts were then treated with histamine with or without histamine-receptor antagonists , and monitored for P05231 production using an ELISA . Four potential downstream signaling molecules , p38 , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , and NF-κB , were evaluated by Western blot , and a luciferase reporter assay . RESULTS : Elevated expression was seen for all histamine receptors , with P05231 protein levels increasing significantly following histamine stimulation . Among the histamine-receptor specific antagonists , only the P35367 antagonist significantly decreased P05231 production in histamine-stimulated nasal fibroblasts . DB11320 increased the expression level of phosphorylated p38 ( pp38 ) , pERK , and pJNK , as well as NF-κB induction . The P35367 antagonist actively suppressed pp38 and NF-κB expression in histamine-induced nasal fibroblasts , but not pERK and pJNK . The p38 inhibitor strongly attenuated P05231 production in histamine-stimulated nasal fibroblasts . CONCLUSIONS : The data presented here suggest that antihistamines may be involved in the regulation of cytokines , such as P05231 , due to the role of histamine as an inflammatory mediator in nasal fibroblasts .
