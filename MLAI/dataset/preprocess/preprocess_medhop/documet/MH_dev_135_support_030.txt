Mutation analyses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of the Kii peninsula , Japan . To clarify the genetic background of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) /parkinsonism-dementia complex ( P20941 ) of the Kii peninsula , Japan ( Kii P35858 / P20941 ) , we performed extended mutation analyses of three patients with pathologically diagnosed Kii P35858 / P20941 . Direct sequencing analyses were performed in 19 genes , including P35858 /frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) -related genes ( P04179 , P08294 , Q96Q42 /alsin , Q16637 , PGRN , P03950 , P15692 , P55072 , O95292 , Q14203 , Q9UQN3 , and Q13148 or Q13148 ) , tauopathy-related gene ( GSK3beta ) , and parkinsonism-related genes ( alpha-synuclein , Q5S007 , parkin , Q99497 , Q9BXM7 , and Q9NQ11 ) . Gene dosage analyses were conducted in screening of P10636 , alpha-synuclein , Q13148 ( or Q13148 ) , GSK3beta , and parkin . We found no mutation in the 19 genes . We found a homozygous nonsynonymous SNP ( Q96Q42 /alsin V368M ) shared by all the three patients . Gene dosage was normal in P10636 , alpha-synuclein , Q13148 , GSK3beta , and parkin . The present findings , together with a previous negative study on P10636 and P00441 mutation , further elucidated the lack of causative mutations in all exons , exon-intron boundaries , or some rearrangements of the reported major causative or susceptible genes related to P35858 , FTLD , parkinsonism , synucleinopathy , Q13148 proteinopathy , and tauopathy . However , the familial aggregation and lack of any environment factors suggest that Kii P35858 / P20941 is caused by other yet unidentified genetic factors .
