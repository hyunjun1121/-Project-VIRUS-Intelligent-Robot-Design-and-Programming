P04626 interacts with P16070 to up-regulate P61073 via epigenetic silencing of microRNA-139 in gastric cancer cells . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) ( neu/ P04626 ) is overexpressed on many types of cancer cells , including gastric cancer cells ; P04626 overexpression has been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis . We investigated the mechanisms by which P04626 regulates cell migration and invasion . METHODS : P04626 expression or activity was reduced in gastric cancer cell lines using small interfering RNAs or the monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab . We identified proteins that interact with P04626 or microRNAs ( miRNAs ) involved in P04626 signaling . We used various software programs to identify miRNAs that regulate factors in the P04626 signaling pathway . We analyzed expression patterns of these miRNAs in gastric cancer cell lines and tumor samples from patients . RESULTS : We found that P16070 binds directly to P04626 , which up-regulates the expression of metastasis-associated protein-1 , induces deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 , and suppresses transcription of microRNA139 ( miR-139 ) to inhibit expression of its target gene , P61073 ( P61073 ) . Knockdown of P04626 and P16070 reduced invasive activity of cultured gastric cancer cells and suppressed tumor growth in nude mice . Lymph node metastasis was associated with high levels of P04626 , P16070 , and P61073 , and reduced levels of miR-139 in human metastatic gastric tumors . Cultures of different types of metastatic cancer cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors and/or DNA methyltransferase resulted in up-regulation of miR-139 . CONCLUSIONS : P04626 interaction with P16070 up-regulates P61073 by inhibiting expression of miR-139 , at the epigenetic level , in gastric cancer cells . These findings indicate how P04626 signaling might promote gastric tumor progression and metastasis .
