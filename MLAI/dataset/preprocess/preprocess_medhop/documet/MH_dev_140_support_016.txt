Membrane P48023 kills human peripheral blood T lymphocytes , and soluble P48023 blocks the killing . It has been believed that the Fas expressed on human peripheral blood T cells ( P10721 ) is nonfunctional , because these cells are insensitive to agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAbs that efficiently kill in vitro-activated T cells and many Fas-expressing cell lines . Here , we demonstrate that membrane-bound P48023 ( P48023 ) kills both fresh and in vitro-activated P10721 , indicating that the Fas expressed on fresh P10721 is functional . In contrast , soluble P48023 kills only the latter . Naive T cells in umbilical cord blood do not express Fas , but can be induced to express Fas by P01579 or by a combination of P60568 and anti- P10747 mAb , after which they acquire sensitivity to membrane but not to soluble P48023 . Soluble P48023 inhibited the killing of fresh P10721 by membrane P48023 . These results indicate that the shedding of P48023 from the membrane is a mechanism for downregulating at least part of its killing activity .
