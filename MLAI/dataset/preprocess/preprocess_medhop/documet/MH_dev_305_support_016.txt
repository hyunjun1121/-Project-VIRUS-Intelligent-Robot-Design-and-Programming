All-trans-retinoic Acid Modulates the Plasticity and Inhibits the Motility of Breast Cancer Cells : ROLE OF P46531 AND TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR ( TGFβ ) . All-trans-retinoic acid ( DB00755 ) is a natural compound proposed for the treatment/chemoprevention of breast cancer . Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a determinant of the cancer cell invasive and metastatic behavior . The effects of DB00755 on EMT are largely unknown . In P04626 -positive SKBR3 and UACC812 cells , showing co-amplification of the P04626 and P10276 genes , DB00755 activates a RARα-dependent epithelial differentiation program . In SKBR3 cells , this causes the formation/reorganization of adherens and tight junctions . Epithelial differentiation and augmented cell-cell contacts underlie the anti-migratory action exerted by the retinoid in cells exposed to the EMT-inducing factors P01133 and heregulin-β1 . Down-regulation of P46531 , an emerging EMT modulator , is involved in the inhibition of motility by DB00755 . Indeed , the retinoid blocks P46531 up-regulation by P01133 and/or heregulin-β1 . Pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase and P46531 processing also abrogates SKBR3 cell migration . Stimulation of TGFβ contributes to the anti-migratory effect of DB00755 . The retinoid switches TGFβ from an EMT-inducing and pro-migratory determinant to an anti-migratory mediator . Inhibition of the P46531 pathway not only plays a role in the anti-migratory action of DB00755 ; it is relevant also for the anti-proliferative activity of the retinoid in HCC1599 breast cancer cells , which are addicted to P46531 for growth/viability . This effect is enhanced by the combination of DB00755 and the γ-secretase inhibitor N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester , supporting the concept that the two compounds act at the transcriptional and post-translational levels along the P46531 pathway .
