DB01259 -mediated cyclooxygenase-2 expression via epidermal growth factor receptor/ Q15717 interaction enhances the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer cells . DB01259 , a dual epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) kinase inhibitor , showed clinical benefits in advanced P04626 -positive breast cancer patients . Because some triple-negative breast cancers ( TNBCs ) frequently overexpress P00533 , the antitumor activity of lapatinib in such diseases was also tested . However , the results showed a worse event-free survival rate . It remains unknown whether and how lapatinib elicits the aggressiveness of such cancer cells . In this study , our results demonstrated that lapatinib facilitated axillary and lung metastases of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells without affecting their viability , leading to worse survival in orthotopic xenograft mice . The lapatinib-increased motility was attributed by the elevation of P00533 through the downregulation of microRNA-7 and by the subsequent overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) . Strikingly , independent of its kinase activity , the elevated P00533 at least partly stabilized P35354 expression by enhancing the binding of Q15717 to P35354 mRNA . Our results suggest that lapatinib may increase the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by upregulating P00533 and P35354 through the downregulation of microRNA-7 , providing a potential explanation for the worse clinical outcome of TNBC patients who receive lapatinib-based treatment . These findings also shed new light on the molecular mechanism of P35354 mRNA stabilization by P00533 in a kinase-independent manner .
