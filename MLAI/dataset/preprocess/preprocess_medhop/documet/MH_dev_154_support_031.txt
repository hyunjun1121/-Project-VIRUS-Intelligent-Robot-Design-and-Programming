Regulation of the Q03405 /uPA system expressed on monocytes by the deactivating cytokines , P05112 , P22301 and P35225 : consequences on cell adhesion to vitronectin and fibrinogen . DB00013 ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) have been proposed to be involved in monocyte migration by inducing degradation of matrix proteins . In addition , Q03405 is also implicated in cell adhesion to the vascular wall . The adhesive function of Q03405 depends on a direct interaction with vitronectin which is increased by uPA and by modification of cell surface integrin ( such as CD11b- P05107 ) when associated to Q03405 . In this study we analysed the role of three deactivating cytokines , P05112 , P22301 and P35225 , on the surface expression of uPA , Q03405 and CD11b by monocytes and their consequences on monocyte adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and vitronectin . P22301 induced a decrease in uPA and CD11b after 18 h incubation and a delayed decrease in Q03405 which was only significant after 48 h incubation . These results may explain the decrease in monocyte adhesion , which was observed after an 18 h incubation with P22301 , on immobilized vitronectin and fibrinogen . In contrast , P05112 and P35225 induced a decrease in Q03405 after 18 h and a significant increase in uPA both in the cell lysates and at the cell surface , as well as an increase in cell surface associated CD11b . These cytokines did not modify cell adhesiveness to vitronectin or fibrinogen despite the increase in CD11b- P05107 . This could be due to the decrease in Q03405 because CD11b- P05107 / Q03405 forms a cell adhesion complex . In addition , the increase in uPA induced by P05112 could counterbalance the direct interaction of Q03405 with vitronectin . The increase in uPA suggests that P05112 and P35225 could induce plaque fissuring by monocytes , whereas P22301 may induce protection against matrix protein degradation by decreasing uPA .
