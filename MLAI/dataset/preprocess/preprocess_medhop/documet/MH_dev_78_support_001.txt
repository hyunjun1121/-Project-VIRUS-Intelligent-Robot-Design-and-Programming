DB00945 -like molecules that covalently inactivate cyclooxygenase-2 . Many of aspirin 's therapeutic effects arise from its acetylation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , whereas its antithrombotic and ulcerogenic effects result from its acetylation of P23219 . Here , aspirin-like molecules were designed that preferentially acetylate and irreversibly inactivate P35354 . The most potent of these compounds was o-(acetoxyphenyl)hept-2-ynyl sulfide ( APHS ) . Relative to aspirin , APHS was 60 times as reactive against P35354 and 100 times as selective for its inhibition ; it also inhibited P35354 in cultured macrophages and colon cancer cells and in the rat air pouch in vivo . Such compounds may lead to the development of aspirin-like drugs for the treatment or prevention of immunological and proliferative diseases without gastrointestinal or hematologic side effects .
