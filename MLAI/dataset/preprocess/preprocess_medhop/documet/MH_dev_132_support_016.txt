[ Cardioverter-defibrillator in the treatment of arrhythmia induced by trastuzumab used in the adjuvant setting in a patient with positive human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2 breast cancer ] . A case of a 36-year old woman with P04626 -positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab left ventricle dysfunction and cardiac arrest in ventricular fibrillation mechanism is presented . After having been successfully resuscitated , trastuzumab therapy was withheld , pharmacotherapy ( beta-blocker , P12821 -I ) implemented and ICD was implanted . Echocardiography performed 6 months later , revealed normal systolic function of the left ventricle . The patient died despite further oncologic treatment due to progression of the disease . The authors discuss the approach to this dramatic but lone cardiac side effect of trastuzumab treatment .
