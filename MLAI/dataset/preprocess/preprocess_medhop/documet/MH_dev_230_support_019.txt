5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside stabilizes low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA in hepatocytes via P29323 -dependent Q15717 binding to an AU-rich element . OBJECTIVE : 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside ( AICAR ) has pleiotropic and beneficial effects on metabolic disorders . However , the effects of AICAR on low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) metabolism are poorly understood . METHODS AND RESULTS : AICAR induces increased P01130 mRNA levels and increased P01130 protein production in hepatocytes . The AICAR-dependent P01130 mRNA increase was partially mediated by mRNA stabilization in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) -dependent manner , but not by the AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) activation . Reporter assays using a variety of constructs harboring the 3'-untranslated region ( UTR ) of human P01130 mRNA revealed that the most upstream AU-rich element ( ARE ) was critical for these AICAR effects . Using UV cross-linking assays , we found increased binding of three cytoplasmic proteins to this ARE region in response to AICAR and identified a 35-kDa protein as Human antigen R ( Q15717 ) . Blocking P29323 signaling pathway activation resulted in attenuated Q15717 binding . Silencing Q15717 expression by RNA interference hindered AICAR-induced P01130 mRNA stability , whereas its overexpression stabilized this mRNA . CONCLUSIONS : AICAR-dependent P01130 mRNA stabilization is mediated , at least in part , by Q15717 binding to the ARE1 region . Given that AICAR enhanced LDL uptake in hepatocytes , our findings warrant further studies using animal models to develop a novel LDL-cholesterol lowering agent as a possible strategy to treat atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases .
