Development of fulminant Type 1 diabetes with thrombocytopenia after influenza vaccination : a case report . BACKGROUND : Fulminant Type 1 diabetes was originally reported as idiopathic Type 1 diabetes . Involvement of viral infections in the pathogenesis of fulminant T1D has been suggested , but the development of fulminant Type 1 diabetes after influenza vaccination has not been reported . CASE REPORT : We report a case of fulminant Type 1 diabetes with thrombocytopenia following influenza vaccination . A 54-year-old man was admitted to hospital with hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketosis . Seven days before admission , he received a seasonal influenza vaccine for the prevention of influenza infection . On admission , blood glucose was 29 mmol/L and HbA1c 40 mmol/mol ( 5.9 % ) . Fasting and 2-h C-peptide immunoreactivity were < 0.0333 nmol/L and 0.0999 nmol/L , respectively . Anti- Q99259 and anti-IA-2 antibodies were negative , so no autoimmunity seemed to participate in the etiology . ELISPOT assay also showed no association with T cell-mediated autoimmunity . HLA genotypes were consistent with susceptibility to fulminant Type 1 diabetes . After the abrupt onset of diabetes , he showed mild thrombocytopenia , which has been observed for approximately 5 years after diabetes development . CONCLUSION : This is the first description of fulminant Type 1 diabetes after influenza vaccination . Our observation raises the possibility that influenza vaccination might trigger this condition via the Q9NYK1 pathway .
