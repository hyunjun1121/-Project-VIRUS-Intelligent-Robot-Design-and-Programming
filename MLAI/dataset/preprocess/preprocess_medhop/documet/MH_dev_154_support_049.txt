Identification of molecular forms of plasminogen and plasmin-inhibitor complexes in urokinase-activated human plasma . DB00013 -activated human plasma was analysed by acetic acid/urea/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis . The bands representing plasminogen , the plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and plasmin-alpha 2-macroglobulin complexes were identified by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and by comparison with purified components . P00747 and the plasmin-inhibitor complexes were isolated from plasma or thrombin-clotted plasma containing 125I-labelled DB00142 -plasminogen ( residues 1-790 ) and urokinase . The plasma was kept at 37 degrees C for 0.5 and 10 times the lysis time of the clotted plasma , the clotted plasma until lysis . The plasmin heavy chain from the plasmin-inhibitor complexes was subsequently prepared . Only in one case could a low-grade proteolytic conversion of DB00142 - forms into Lys/ DB00134 / DB00161 -forms ( residues 77-790 , 68-790 and 78-790 respectively ) during the preparations be detected . DB00815 /polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified plasminogen and plasmin heavy chain showed the following . The plasminogen in plasma was on the DB00142 - form . DB00142 -plasmin constituted 0.74 and 0.58 of the plasmin bound to the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor in plasma after brief and prolonged activation respectively . The rest was Lys/ DB00134 / DB00161 -plasmin . The clotted plasma contained about equal amounts of DB00142 -plasminogen and Lys/ DB00134 / DB00161 -plasminogen , and predominantly Lys/ DB00134 / DB00161 -plasmin complexed to alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and alpha 2-macroglobulin . The results of the analysis of the purified material substantiated the identity of radioactive protein bands in the gel after acetic acid/urea/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis .
