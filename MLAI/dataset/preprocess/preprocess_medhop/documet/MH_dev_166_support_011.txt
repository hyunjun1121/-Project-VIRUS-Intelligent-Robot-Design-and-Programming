P14210 / P24001 , a four-kringle antagonist of hepatocyte growth factor , is an angiogenesis inhibitor that suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in mice . We reported that P24001 , composed of the N-terminal hairpin and subsequent four kringle domains of hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) , acts as the competitive antagonist for P14210 . We now provide the first evidence that P24001 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis as an angiogenesis inhibitor as well as an P14210 antagonist . Administration of P24001 suppressed primary tumor growth and lung metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma and Jyg-MC(A) mammary carcinoma s.c. implanted into mice , although neither P14210 nor P24001 affected proliferation and survival of these tumor cells in vitro . P24001 treatment resulted in a remarkable decrease in microvessel density and an increase of apoptotic tumor cells in primary tumors , which suggests that the inhibition of primary tumor growth by P24001 may be achieved by suppression of tumor angiogenesis . In vivo , P24001 inhibited angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membranes and in rabbit corneal neovascularization induced by basic fibroblast growth factor ( P09038 ) . In vitro , P24001 inhibited growth and migration of human microvascular endothelial cells induced by P09038 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) as well as by P14210 . P14210 and P15692 activated the DB00134 / P08581 and the P35968 / P15692 receptor , respectively , whereas P24001 inhibited P14210 -induced DB00134 tyrosine phosphorylation but not P15692 -induced P35968 phosphorylation . P24001 inhibited P14210 -induced P27361 /2 ( Q8TCB0 /42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ) activation , but allowed for P09038 - and P15692 -induced P27361 /2 activation . These results indicate that P24001 is an angiogenesis inhibitor as well as an P14210 antagonist , and that the antiangiogenic action of P24001 is independent of its activity as P14210 antagonist . The bifunctional properties of P24001 to act as an angiogenesis inhibitor and as an P14210 antagonist raises the possibility that P24001 may prove therapeutic for cancer patients .
