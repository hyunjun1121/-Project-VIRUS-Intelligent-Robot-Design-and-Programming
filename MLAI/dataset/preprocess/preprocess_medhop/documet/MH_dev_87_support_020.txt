Dehydration activates an NF-kappaB-driven , P35354 -dependent survival mechanism in renal medullary interstitial cells . Renal prostaglandin ( PG ) synthesis is mediated by cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 ( P23219 and P35354 ) . After dehydration , the maintenance of normal renal function becomes particularly dependent upon PG synthesis . The present studies were designed to examine the potential link between medullary P23219 and P35354 expression in hypertonic stress . In response to water deprivation , P35354 , but not P23219 , mRNA levels increase significantly in the renal medulla , specifically in renal medullary interstitial cells ( RMICs ) . DB09145 deprivation also increases renal NF-kappaB-driven reporter expression in transgenic mice . NF-kappaB activity and P35354 expression could be induced in cultured RMICs with hypertonic sodium chloride and mannitol , but not urea . RMIC P35354 expression was also induced by driving NF-kappaB activation with a constitutively active O15111 alpha ( IKKalpha ) . Conversely , introduction of a dominant-negative IkappaB mutant reduced P35354 expression after hypertonicity or IKKalpha induction . RMICs failed to survive hypertonicity when P35354 was downregulated using a P35354 -selective antisense or blocked with the selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) SC58236 , reagents that did not affect cell survival in isotonic media . In rabbits treated with SC58236 , water deprivation induced apoptosis of medullary interstitial cells in the renal papilla . These results demonstrate that water deprivation and hypertonicity activate NF-kappaB . The consequent increase in P35354 expression favors RMIC survival in hypertonic conditions . Inhibition of RMIC P35354 could contribute to NSAID-induced papillary injury .
