Expression of membrane complement regulators , P15529 , P08174 and P13987 , in mesothelial cells of patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy . We investigated the expression of membrane complement regulators ( CRegs ) , P15529 , P08174 and P13987 in human mesothelial cells , and correlated with clinical background and level of complement ( C ) activation products in peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) fluids ( PDF ) to clarify influence of the C activation system in PD patients . Expression of CRegs was assessed on primary cultures of mesothelial cells ( HPMC ) harvested from PD fluid of 31 PD patients . Because expression of P08174 but not P15529 and P13987 in mesothelial cells was significantly correlated to value of dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio ( D/P Cre ) ( p < 0.005 ) as an indicator of peritoneal function , we focused on analysis of P08174 expression of HPMCs in comparison with levels of C activation products in the PDF of the PD patients , and their background factors . When comparing expression of the CRegs between systemic neutrophils and HPMC , no correlation was observed , supporting that change of CRegs ' expression in HPMC was independently occurring in the peritoneum . Expression of P08174 protein in HPMC was closely correlated with expression at the mRNA level ( p < 0.0001 ) and was inversely correlated with levels of sC5b-9 ( p < 0.05 ) , but not P01024 , C4 , P05231 and Q8WXI7 in the PDF . Complications of diabetes , usage of icodextrin and residual renal function were not correlated with change of P08174 expression in HPMCs . Our data show that the process of PD therapy modifies expression of P08174 on peritoneal mesothelium and triggers local C activation . These findings support efforts to modify PD therapy to limit effects on activation and regulation of the C system .
