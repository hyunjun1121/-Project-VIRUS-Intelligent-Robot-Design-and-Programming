Monoclonal antibodies against human dendritic cell-like peripheral blood monocytes activated by granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor plus interleukin 4 . Human peripheral blood monocytes activated by GM- P04141 plus P05112 have recently been found to exhibit characteristics of putative dendritic cells ( DC ) . These cytokine-activated monocytes ( P62158 ) may express novel activation Ag that contribute significantly to their antigen presentation potency . To examine that possibility , mAb specific for P62158 were derived . Seven mAb that stained P62158 but not unactivated monocytes and other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types were identified . Further screening with a panel of cell lines identified two P62158 -specific mAb . The first mAb , 2.1D10 , was found to be mannose-receptor specific . A second mAb , 6.3B7 , immunoprecipitated a 190-kDa Ag . It stained neither activated B cells nor the putative peripheral blood precursor DC population . Furthermore , 6.3B7 did not recognize determinants in asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains or in sialic acid-containing structures . These mAb against P62158 membrane proteins may provide new insights into the requirements for optimal antigen presentation by macrophages and other P25054 types .
