Developmental programming : effect of prenatal steroid excess on intraovarian components of insulin signaling pathway and related proteins in sheep . Prenatal testosterone ( T ) excess increases ovarian follicular recruitment , follicular persistence , insulin resistance , and compensatory hyperinsulinemia . Considering the importance of insulin in ovarian physiology , in this study , using prenatal T- and dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 , a nonaromatizable androgen ) -treated female sheep , we tested the hypothesis that prenatal androgen excess alters the intraovarian insulin signaling cascade and metabolic mediators that have an impact on insulin signaling . Changes in ovarian insulin receptor ( INSRB ) , insulin receptor substrate 1 ( P35568 ) , mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PIK3 ) , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) , and adiponectin proteins were determined at fetal ( Days 90 and 140 ) , postpubertal ( 10 mo ) , and adult ( 21 mo ) ages by immunohistochemistry . Results indicated that these proteins were expressed in granulosa , theca , and stromal compartments , with INSRB , P35568 , P37231 , and adiponectin increasing in parallel with advanced follicular differentiation . Importantly , prenatal T excess induced age-specific changes in P37231 and adiponectin expression , with increased P37231 expression evident during fetal life and decreased antral follicular adiponectin expression during adult life . Comparison of developmental changes in prenatal T and DB02901 -treated females found that the effects on P37231 were programmed by androgenic actions of T , whereas the effects on adiponectin were likely by its estrogenic action . These results suggest a role for P37231 in the programming of ovarian disruptions by prenatal T excess , including a decrease in antral follicular adiponectin expression and a contributory role for adiponectin in follicular persistence and ovulatory failure .
