The cooperation between hMena overexpression and P04626 signalling in breast cancer . hMena and the epithelial specific isoform hMena(11a) are actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins belonging to the Ena/ P50552 family . P01133 treatment of breast cancer cell lines upregulates hMena/hMena(11a) expression and phosphorylates hMena(11a) , suggesting cross-talk between the ErbB receptor family and hMena/hMena(11a) in breast cancer . The aim of this study was to determine whether the hMena/hMena(11a) overexpression cooperates with HER-2 signalling , thereby affecting the P04626 mitogenic activity in breast cancer . In a cohort of breast cancer tissue samples a significant correlation among hMena , P04626 overexpression , the proliferation index ( high Ki67 ) , and phosphorylated MAPK and AKT was found and among the molecular subtypes the highest frequency of hMena overexpressing tumors was found in the P04626 subtype . From a clinical viewpoint , concomitant overexpression of P04626 and hMena identifies a subgroup of breast cancer patients showing the worst prognosis , indicating that hMena overexpression adds prognostic information to P04626 overexpressing tumors . To identify a functional link between P04626 and hMena , we show here that P04626 transfection in MCF7 cells increased hMena/hMena(11a) expression and hMena(11a) phosphorylation . On the other hand , hMena/hMena(11a) knock-down reduced P21860 , AKT and Q8TCB0 /42 MAPK phosphorylation and inhibited the P01133 and Q02297 -dependent P04626 phosphorylation and cell proliferation . Of functional significance , hMena/hMena(11a) knock-down reduced the mitogenic activity of P01133 and Q02297 . Collectively these data provide new insights into the relevance of hMena and hMena(11a) as downstream effectors of the ErbB receptor family which may represent a novel prognostic indicator in breast cancer progression , helping to stratify patients .
