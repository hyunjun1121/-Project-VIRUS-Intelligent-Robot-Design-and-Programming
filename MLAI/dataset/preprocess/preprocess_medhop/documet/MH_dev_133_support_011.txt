DB00588 -induced regulation of the balance within macrophage subpopulations . In asthma , treatment with inhaled corticosteroids reduces chronic peribronchial inflammation and restores the balance within macrophage subpopulations . This study investigates whether corticosteroids can regulate monocyte differentiation in vitro and thereby influence the balance of functionally distinct macrophages . Graded doses of fluticasone propionate ( FP ) were added to cultures of normal peripheral blood monocytes in the presence or absence of P05112 . Cells were harvested after 7 days ' culture . Double immunofluorescence studies were performed on cytospins of differentiated macrophages using the MoAbs RFD1 and RFD7 to distinguish inductive and suppressive macrophages by their respective phenotypes . Macrophage function was determined by quantifying allostimulation in a mixed leucocyte reaction and by measuring tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) production . FP reduced the number of mature cells with a D1+ antigen-presenting phenotype and up-regulated the development of cells with the D1/D7+ and D7+ phenotypes . Functionally , this was associated with reduced stimulation of T cell proliferation in a mixed leucocyte reaction ( P08235 ) . DB00588 also reversed the increase in both D1+ expression and P01375 production induced by P05112 . The effect of FP persisted for 24 h after removal of FP from the culture medium . These results suggest that FP treatment of asthmatics may have a direct beneficial effect by normalizing the macrophage subset imbalance that contributes to the chronic peribronchial inflammation present in this condition .
