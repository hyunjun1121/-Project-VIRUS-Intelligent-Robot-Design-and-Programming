Akt/ P31749 suppresses DNA damage processing and checkpoint activation in late G2 . Using chemical genetics to reversibly inhibit Cdk1 , we find that cells arrested in late G2 are unable to delay mitotic entry after irradiation . Late G2 cells detect DNA damage lesions and form gamma- P16104 foci but fail to activate Chk1 . This reflects a lack of DNA double-strand break processing because late G2 cells fail to recruit RPA ( replication protein A ) , ATR ( ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related ) , Rad51 , or Q99708 ( C-terminal interacting protein ) to sites of radiation-induced damage , events essential for both checkpoint activation and initiation of DNA repair by homologous recombination . Remarkably , inhibition of Akt/ P31749 ( protein kinase B ) restores DNA damage processing and Chk1 activation after irradiation in late G2 . These data demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Akt in cell cycle regulation of DNA repair and checkpoint activation . Because Akt/ P31749 is frequently activated in many tumor types , these findings have important implications for the evolution and therapy of such cancers .
