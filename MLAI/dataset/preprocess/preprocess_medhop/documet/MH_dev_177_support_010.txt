Hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depressive behaviors . Telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders . However , the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear . Here we show that chronic mild stress ( CMS ) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase ( O14746 ) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus . Treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the CMS-induced O14746 and telomerase activity changes . Inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration ( 100 mg · kg(-1) · d(-1) , i.p. , for 14 d ) , intrahippocampal microinjection ( 0.7 μmol , 2 μl ) , or infusion ( using an osmotic minipump , 0.134 μg/μl , 0.25 μl/h ) of 3'-azido-deoxythymidine ( DB00495 ) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice . In contrast , overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse O14746 ( Ad-mTERT-GFP ) led to neurogenesis upregulation , produced antidepressant-like behaviors , and prevented the CMS-induced behavioral modifications . Disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by X-irradiation ( 15 Gy ) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of Ad-mTERT-GFP . Additionally , DB00495 had no effect on DNA polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo . Microinjection of DB00495 into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle ( 0.7 μmol , 2 μl ) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect . These results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors , possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis .
