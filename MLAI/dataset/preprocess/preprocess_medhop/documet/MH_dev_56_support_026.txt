DB01590 exhibits efficacy as a radiosensitizer in a model of non-small cell lung cancer . Signaling pathways that activate P42345 ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) are altered in many human cancers and these alterations are associated with prognosis and treatment response . P42345 inhibition can restore sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin . The rapamycin derivative everolimus exhibits antitumor activity and is approved for patients with renal cell cancer . Clinically , everolimus has also been evaluated in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) that were refractory to chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors . We tested the effects of combined treatment with everolimus ( RAD001 ) and fractionated radiation using a xenograft model of human NSCLC ( A549 cells ) . In growth studies , mean tumor volume was reduced in the everolimus plus 30 Gy cohort with significant tumor growth suppression compared to 30 Gy alone ( p=0015 ) , or everolimus alone ( p < 0.001 , Q9UNW9 ) . everolimus ( 20 nM ) significantly reduced protein levels of the P42345 downstream effector P08133 -S6K compared with radiation and vehicle ( p=0.05 , Q9UNW9 ) and significantly suppressed phospho- P08133 -S6K levels compared with all other treatments ( p < 0.001 , Q9UNW9 ) . We also evaluated everolimus and radiation effects on gene expression in A549 cells . DB01590 ± 5 Gy suppressed endothelin 1 and lactate dehydrogenase expression and increased P15692 , P38936 , hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and P11166 ( facilitated glucose transporter 1 ) . P42345 mRNA levels were unaffected while P01375 -α levels were increased with everolimus + 5 Gy compared to either treatment alone . These findings suggest that everolimus increases the antitumor activity of radiation . Clinical trials combining everolimus with fractionated radiation in patients with NSCLC are warranted .
