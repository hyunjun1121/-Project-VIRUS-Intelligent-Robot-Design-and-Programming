UMD ( Universal mutation database ) : a generic software to build and analyze locus-specific databases . The human genome is thought to contain about 80,000 genes and presently only 3,000 are known to be implicated in genetic diseases . In the near future , the entire sequence of the human genome will be available and the development of new methods for point mutation detection will lead to a huge increase in the identification of genes and their mutations associated with genetic diseases as well as cancers , which is growing in frequency in industrial states . The collection of these mutations will be critical for researchers and clinicians to establish genotype/phenotype correlations . Other fields such as molecular epidemiology will also be developed using these new data . Consequently , the future lies not in simple repositories of locus-specific mutations but in dynamic databases linked to various computerized tools for their analysis and that can be directly queried on-line . To meet this goal , we devised a generic software called UMD ( Universal Mutation Database ) . It was developed as a generic software to create locus-specific databases ( LSDBs ) with the 4(th) Dimension(R) package from ACI . This software includes an optimized structure to assist and secure data entry and to allow the input of various clinical data . Thanks to the flexible structure of the UMD software , it has been successfully adapted to nine genes either involved in cancer ( P25054 , P04637 , P06400 , O00255 , Q09428 , P40337 , and P19544 ) or in genetic diseases ( P35555 and P01130 ) . Four new LSDBs are under construction ( P49748 , P11310 , KIR6 , and P29400 ) . Finally , the data can be transferred to core databases .
