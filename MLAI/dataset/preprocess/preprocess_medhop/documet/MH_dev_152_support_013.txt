Downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme II is associated with pacing-induced sustained atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , the most common cardiac arrhythmia , is frequently accompanied by atrial interstitial fibrosis . Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in interstitial fibrosis during the development of AF . However , Ang II could be further degraded by angiotensin converting enzyme II ( Q9BYF1 ) . We examined expression of Q9BYF1 in the fibrillating atria of pigs and its involvement in fibrotic pathogenesis during AF . Nine adult pigs underwent continuous rapid atrial pacing to induce sustained AF and six pigs were sham controls ( i.e. , sinus rhythm ; SR ) . In the histological examinations , extensive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the interstitial space of the atria , as evidenced by Masson 's trichrome stain , were found in fibrillating atria . The relative amount of collagen type I in the atria with AF was significantly increased as compared with that in the SR . Local P12821 activity in the fibrillating atria was also markedly higher than that in the SR subjects . Q9BYF1 gene and protein expression in the AF subjects were significantly decreased compared with those in the SR subjects , whereas expression of mitogen-activated/ P29323 kinase 1/2 ( Q02750 /2 ) , extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 ( P28482 ) , and activated P28482 were significantly greater in the AF subjects . We propose that decreasing Q9BYF1 expression during AF may affect the Ang II-dependent signaling pathway . In addition , our results suggest that atrial fibrosis in AF may be induced by antagonistic regulation between P12821 and Q9BYF1 expression .
