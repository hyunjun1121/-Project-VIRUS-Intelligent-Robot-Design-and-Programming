Effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha on estrogen metabolic pathways in breast cancer cells . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 -α ) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been linked to breast cancer development . Estrogen metabolic pathway is also involved in breast carcinogenesis and DNA adducts formation . In this study we investigated the effect of P01375 -α on the estrogen metabolic pathway in MCF-7 , a breast cancer cell line . Capillary liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry ( LC/MS ) and High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) were used for analysis of estrogen metabolites and estrogen-DNA adducts levels respectively . Reporter gene assay , Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( real time RT-PCR ) and Western blot were used to assess the expression of estrogen metabolizing genes and enzymes . P01375 -α significantly increased the total EM and decreased the estrone ( E1 ) / 17-β estradiol ( E2 ) ratio . Moreover , it altered the expression of genes and enzymes involved in E2 activation and deactivation pathways e.g. Cytochrome P-450 1A1 ( P04798 ) , Cytochrome P-450 1B1 ( Q16678 ) , Catechol-O-methyl transferase ( P21964 ) and DB02701 adenine dinucleotide phosphate-quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( P15559 ) . In addition , there were increased levels of some catechol estrogens e.g. 4-hydroxy-estrone ( 4-OHE1 ) and 2-hydroxyestradiol ( 2-OHE2 ) with decreased levels of methylated catechols e.g. 2-methoxy estradiol ( DB02342 ) . DNA adducts especially 4-OHE1-[2]-1-N3 DB00173 was significantly increased . P01375 -α directs the estrogen metabolism into more hormonally active and carcinogenic products in MCF-7 . This may implicate a new possible explanation for inflammation associated breast cancer .
