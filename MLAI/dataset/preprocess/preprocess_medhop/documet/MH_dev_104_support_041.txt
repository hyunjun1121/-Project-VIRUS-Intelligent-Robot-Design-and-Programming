Beneficial vasoactive endothelial effects of fluvastatin : focus on prostacyclin and nitric oxide . Statins are believed to exert beneficial effects against cardiovascular disease beyond correction of dyslipidemia . There are however still very sparse data on how individual statins interact with the production of vasoactive eicosanoids and nitric oxide ( NO ) in human vascular endothelial cells . Here we have determined how fluvastatin affects the mRNA expression of genes associated with vascular reactivity as well as the formation of two major vasodilators , prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) and NO , in human endothelial cells . Also , the influence of fluvastatin on arterial resistance was assessed in isolated small arteries . We show that the promoter activity of prostacyclin synthase ( Q16647 ) , the mRNA expression of Q16647 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) , and the production of DB01240 and NO are significantly induced by fluvastatin . Also , strong rapid dilatation ex vivo was observed , with the equal contribution of DB01240 and NO . Our findings in cell culture experiments and in isolated human arteries indicate that fluvastatin-evoked endothelium-derived vasodilator production may confer protection of the endothelial cells via both acute and long-term effects of fluvastatin treatment . If these effects take place in vivo , we suggest a protective pleiotropic role of fluvastatin on the cardiovascular system , particularly at the level of the vascular endothelium , to ameliorate the process of atherogenesis and in the acute manner to reduce vascular tone .
