Inhibitors of Q06187 and Q08881 : state of the new drugs for cancer , autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases . Q06187 and Q08881 are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of crucial importance for B and T cell development , with loss-of-function mutations causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to severe , frequently lethal , Epstein-Barr virus infection , respectively . Over the last few years , considerable efforts have been made in order to develop small-molecule inhibitors for these kinases to treat lymphocyte malignancies , autoimmunity or allergy/hypersensitivity . The rationale is that even if complete lack of Q06187 or Q08881 during development causes severe immunodeficiency , inactivation after birth may result in a less severe phenotype . Moreover , therapy can be transient or only partially block the activity of Q06187 or Q08881 . Furthermore , a drug-induced B cell deficiency is treatable by gamma globulin substitution therapy . The newly developed Q06187 inhibitor P05154 -32765 , recently renamed DB09053 , has already entered several clinical trials for various forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as for multiple myeloma . Experimental animal studies have demonstrated highly promising treatment effects also in autoimmunity . Q08881 inhibitors are still under the early developmental phase , but it can be expected that such drugs will also become very useful . In this study , we present Q06187 and Q08881 with their signalling pathways and review the development of the corresponding inhibitors .
