Associations of patella lead with polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor , delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase genes . A cross-sectional analysis was performed to evaluate associations of polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) , delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( P13716 ) , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) genes with patella lead concentrations in 652 lead workers in the Republic of Korea . There was a wide range of patella lead ( from below detection limit to 946 microg Pb/g bone mineral ) , with a mean ( standard deviation ) of 75.2 ( 101.0 ) . There were no associations of P13716 or P29474 genotypes with patella lead , but workers with the P11473 B allele had significantly ( P value < 0.05 ) higher patella lead ( on average , 25 % or approximately 6.6 microg Pb/g bone mineral ) than lead workers with the P11473 bb genotype . There was evidence that the relation between age and patella lead was modified by both the P11473 and P29474 genotypes .
