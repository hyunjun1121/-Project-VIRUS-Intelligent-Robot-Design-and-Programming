Association of a polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene with chronic kidney disease in Japanese individuals with metabolic syndrome . The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) in Japanese individuals with metabolic syndrome . The study population comprised 2150 Japanese individuals with metabolic syndrome , including 411 subjects with CKD [ estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) < 50 mL/min/1.73m(2) ] and 1739 controls ( eGFR >/= 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) ) . The genotypes for 100 polymorphisms of 80 candidate genes were determined . The chi-square test , multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates , as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that nine polymorphisms of P02649 , O95477 , P23219 , P01375 , Q96IY4 , P30556 , Q8NGZ3 , and P16520 were associated ( P < 0.05 ) with the prevalence of CKD . Among these polymorphisms , the -219G --> T polymorphism of P02649 ( rs405509 ) was most significantly associated with CKD in Japanese individuals with metabolic syndrome .
