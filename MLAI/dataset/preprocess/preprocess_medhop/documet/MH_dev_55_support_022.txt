DB00197 inhibits isolated cell proliferation , and induces apoptosis in isolated rat mesangial cells . BACKGROUND/AIMS : DB00197 is one of thiazolidinedione derivatives as a high affinity ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . The in vivo studies demonstrated that troglitazone ameliorated microalbuminuria . There have been few reports about direct effect of thiazolidinedione derivatives on mesangial cell function . We determined the effect of troglitazone on isolated rat mesangial cell proliferation . METHODS : We determined P37231 mRNA expression in isolated rat mesangial cells . Chronic effects of 10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/l troglitazone on mesangial cell proliferation and mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase activity were also determined . The effects of troglitazone on apoptosis were investigated in rat mesangial cells . RESULTS : Rat P37231 mRNA was detected in isolated rat mesangial cells . Living cell number , assessed by colorimetric [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ] ( MTT ) assay , was significantly decreased with 10(-4) mol/l troglitazone . The addition of 10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/l troglitazone dose-dependently inhibited 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) uptake into isolated rat mesangial cells . The addition of 10(-4) and 10(-5) mol/l troglitazone significantly reduced Q96HU1 kinase activity . DB00197 at the concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/l dose-dependently increased DNA fragmentation rates , indicating that troglitazone may cause apoptosis in rat mesangial cells . Bax and Bcl-xL proteins were not changed , although Bcl-2 proteins increased with troglitazone . CONCLUSIONS : The present data demonstrated that troglitazone inhibits cell proliferation , and induces apoptosis in rat mesangial cells , raising a possibility that it directly affects renal function .
