P00734 kringle-2 induces death of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in vitro via microglial activation . We have shown that prothrombin kringle-2 ( pKr-2 ) , a domain of human prothrombin distinct from thrombin could activate cultured rat brain microglia in vitro . However , little is known whether pKr-2-induced microglial activation could cause neurotoxicity on dopaminergic ( DA ) neurons in vivo . To address this question , pKr-2 was injected into the rat substantia nigra ( SN ) . Tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry experiments demonstrate significant loss of DA neurons seven days after injection of pKr-2 . In parallel , pKr-2-activated microglia were detected in the SN with OX-42 and OX-6 immunohistochemistry . Reverse transcription PCR and double-label immunohistochemistry revealed that activated microglia in vivo exhibit early and transient expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and several proinflammatory cytokines . The pKr-2-induced loss of SN DA neurons was partially inhibited by the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride , and the P35354 inhibitor DuP-697 . P27361 /2 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were activated in the SN as early as 1 hr after pKr-2 injection , and localized within microglia . Inhibition of these kinases led to attenuation of mRNA expression of P35228 , P35354 and several proinflammatory cytokines , and rescue of DA neurons in the SN . Intriguingly , following treatment with pKr-2 in vitro , neurotoxicity was detected exclusively in co-cultures of mesencephalic neurons and microglia , but not microglia-free neuron-enriched mesencephalic cultures , indicating that microglia are required for pKr-2 neurotoxicity . Our results strongly suggest that microglia activated by endogenous compound(s) , such as pKr-2 , are implicated in the DA neuronal cell death in the SN .
