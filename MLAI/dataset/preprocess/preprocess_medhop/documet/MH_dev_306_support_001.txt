The emerging role of cannabinoid neuromodulators in symptom management . INTRODUCTION : The cannabinoids nabilone ( DB00486 ) and dronabinol ( Marinol ) are indicated for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) in cancer patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic therapy . DISCUSSION : The endocannabinoid ( CB ) system interacts with numerous other systems and pharmaceutical cannabinoids target ubiquitous P21554 and CB2 receptors in the central nervous system and periphery , relieving nausea and vomiting and pain . SUMMARY : The benefits of this novel class of medications in cancer may extend beyond CINV , as indicated by data from preclinical studies and animal models .
