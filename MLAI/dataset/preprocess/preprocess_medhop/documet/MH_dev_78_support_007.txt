P35354 promotes early atherosclerotic lesion formation in ApoE-deficient and C57BL/6 mice . Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) 2 is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions . We have previously reported that selective inhibition of P35354 reduces early atherosclerosis in P01130 deficient mice . To examine the role of P35354 in atherosclerosis in other mouse models , we studied the effects of selective P35354 inhibition ( by rofecoxib and NS-398 ) and nonselective P36551 inhibition ( by indomethacin ) on early atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( apoE(-/-) ) mice . Selective P35354 and nonselective P36551 inhibition reduced atherosclerosis in female apoE(-/-) mice by 35-38 % and 38-51 % in the proximal and en face aortas , respectively . Next we investigated the role of macrophage P35354 by transplanting P35354 (-/-) fetal liver cells into C57BL/6 mice and challenging the mice with an atherogenic diet . Genetic deletion of P35354 from hematopoietic cells reduced atherosclerosis by 51 % . In addition , LPS activated P35354 (-/-) macrophages had decreased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( P13500 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) . The results demonstrate that selective inhibition of P35354 and elimination of P35354 from macrophages significantly reduces early atherosclerotic lesion formation in apoE-deficient and C57BL/6 mice . These results are compatible with P35354 expression by macrophages having a proatherogenic role , and support the potential of anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis .
