American ginseng improves neurocognitive function in senescence-accelerated mice : possible role of the upregulated insulin and choline acetyltransferase gene expression . AIM : To investigate the effects of American ginseng on neurocognitive function and glucose regulation in senescence-accelerated mice . METHODS : Male senescence-resistant inbred strains ( SAMR1 ) and senescence-prone inbred strains ( SAMP10 ) mice were divided into five groups and fed either a control diet or an American ginseng-supplemented diet ( 1 % or 2 % g/g ) from 6 weeks to 10 months of age . Bodyweight , levels of fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) and grading scores were monitored every month and neurocognitive functions were evaluated at 9 months of age with a KUROBOX apparatus using a stress-free positive cue task . Gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta ( Q07869 -δ ) , insulin , choline acetyltransferase ( P28329 ) and amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) in the brain were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays . RESULTS : American ginseng decreased FPG in SAMR1 mice , but increased FPG in SAMP10 mice . Correct visit ratios were higher in both SAMR1 and SAMP10 strains consuming an American ginseng-supplemented diet . Gene upregulation of insulin and P28329 in the brain , but not of Q07869 -δ or P05067 , was evident in American ginseng-fed groups . CONCLUSION : Daily consumption of American ginseng induced an enhancement in neurocognitive function in senescence-accelerated mice , which could be related to the upregulation of insulin and P28329 gene expression in the brain .
