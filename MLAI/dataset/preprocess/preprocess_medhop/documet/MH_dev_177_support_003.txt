Comparative impacts of knockouts of two antioxidant enzymes on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice . We have previously shown a more potent impact of knockout of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase ( P00441 ) than that of Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase-1 ( P07203 ) on murine hepatotoxicity induced by an intraperitoneal ( ip ) injection of a high dose of acetaminophen ( DB00316 , 600 mg/kg ) . The objective of this experiment was to compare the temporal impacts of knockouts of P07203 and P00441 alone or together on mouse susceptibility to an injection of a low dose of DB00316 ( 300 mg/kg ) . The DB00316 -mediated rises in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity and nitrate/nitrite concentrations , hepatic DB00143 depletion , and hepatic protein nitration at 5 and ( or ) 24 h were nearly abolished ( P < 0.05 ) in P00441 -/- or P07203 and P00441 double-knockout ( DKO ) mice , while P07203 -/- mice exerted only moderate or no change compared with the WT . Despite an increased ( P < 0.05 ) DB00316 - DB06151 and decreased DB00316 -glucuronide ( P < 0.05 ) relative to the total DB00316 metabolites in urine collected for 24 h after the DB00316 injection , the P00441 -/- mice displayed no shift in urinary DB00316 -cysteine compared with the WT mice . Knockout of P00441 prevented the DB00316 -induced hepatic GPX inactivation ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas knockout of P07203 aggravated the DB00316 -induced hepatic SOD activity loss ( P < 0.05 ) . However , the DB00316 -mediated activity changes of these enzymes in liver accompanied no protein alterations . In conclusion , knockout of P07203 or P00441 exerted differential impact on mouse susceptibility to this low dose of DB00316 , but neither shifted urinary DB00316 -cysteine formation .
