DB06643 in postmenopausal osteoporosis : what the clinician needs to know . DB06643 is a subcutaneously ( SC ) administered investigational fully human monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand ( O14788 ) , a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is the principal mediator of osteoclastic bone resorption . O14788 stimulates the formation , activity , and survival of osteoclasts , and is implicated in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders associated with increased bone remodeling . DB06643 binds O14788 , preventing it from binding to Q9Y6Q6 , thereby reducing the formation , activity , and survival of osteoclasts and slowing the rate of bone resorption . Postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density ( BMD ) treated with denosumab have a reduction of bone turnover markers and an increase in BMD that is rapid , sustained , and reversible . In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis , denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral , hip , and nonvertebral fractures . In postmenopausal women with low BMD randomized to receive denosumab or alendronate , denosumab is associated with a significantly greater increase in BMD and further reduction in bone turnover markers compared with alendronate . In postmenopausal women with low BMD who were previously treated with alendronate , those who switched to denosumab have a significantly greater BMD increase and further reduction in bone turnover markers compared with those continuing alendronate . DB06643 is well tolerated with a favorable safety profile . It is a promising emerging drug for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis , offering a long dosing interval of every 6 months and convenient SC dosing , with the potential of improving long-term adherence to therapy compared with current oral treatments .
