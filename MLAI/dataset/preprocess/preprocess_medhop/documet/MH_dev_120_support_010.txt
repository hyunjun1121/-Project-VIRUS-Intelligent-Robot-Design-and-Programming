Atheroprotective effect of oleoylethanolamide ( OEA ) targeting oxidized LDL . Dietary fat-derived lipid oleoylethanolamide ( OEA ) has shown to modulate lipid metabolism through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( Q07869 -α ) -mediated mechanism . In our study , we further demonstrated that OEA , as an atheroprotective agent , modulated the atherosclerotic plaques development . In vitro studies showed that OEA antagonized oxidized LDL ( ox-LDL ) -induced vascular endothelial cell proliferation and vascular smooth muscle cell migration , and suppressed lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced LDL modification and inflammation . In vivo studies , atherosclerosis animals were established using balloon-aortic denudation ( Q92934 ) rats and ApoE(-/-) mice fed with high-caloric diet ( HCD ) for 17 or 14 weeks respectively , and atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated by oil red staining . The administration of OEA ( 5 mg/kg/day , intraperitoneal injection , i.p. ) prevented or attenuated the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in HCD- Q92934 rats or HCD-ApoE(-/-) mice . Gene expression analysis of vessel tissues from these animals showed that OEA induced the mRNA expressions of Q07869 -α and downregulated the expression of M-CFS , an atherosclerotic marker , and genes involved in oxidation and inflammation , including P35228 , P35354 , P01375 -α and P05231 . Collectively , our results suggested that OEA exerted a pharmacological effect on modulating atherosclerotic plaque formation through the inhibition of LDL modification in vascular system and therefore be a potential candidate for anti-atherosclerosis drug .
