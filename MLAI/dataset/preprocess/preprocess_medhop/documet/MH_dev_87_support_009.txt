Effect of active smoking on the human bronchial epithelium transcriptome . BACKGROUND : Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths . Tobacco smoke exposure is the strongest aetiological factor associated with lung cancer . In this study , using serial analysis of gene expression ( Q9NXZ1 ) , we comprehensively examined the effect of active smoking by comparing the transcriptomes of clinical specimens obtained from current , former and never smokers , and identified genes showing both reversible and irreversible expression changes upon smoking cessation . RESULTS : Twenty-four Q9NXZ1 profiles of the bronchial epithelium of eight current , twelve former and four never smokers were generated and analyzed . In total , 3,111,471 Q9NXZ1 tags representing over 110 thousand potentially unique transcripts were generated , comprising the largest human Q9NXZ1 study to date . We identified 1,733 constitutively expressed genes in current , former and never smoker transcriptomes . We have also identified both reversible and irreversible gene expression changes upon cessation of smoking ; reversible changes were frequently associated with either xenobiotic metabolism , nucleotide metabolism or mucus secretion . Increased expression of Q07654 , O75952 , and Q5MY95 were found to be reversible upon smoking cessation . Expression of P49841 , which regulates P35354 expression , was irreversibly decreased . P98088 expression was only partially reversed . Validation of select genes was performed using quantitative RT-PCR on a secondary cohort of nine current smokers , seven former smokers and six never smokers . CONCLUSION : Expression levels of some of the genes related to tobacco smoking return to levels similar to never smokers upon cessation of smoking , while expression of others appears to be permanently altered despite prolonged smoking cessation . These irreversible changes may account for the persistent lung cancer risk despite smoking cessation .
