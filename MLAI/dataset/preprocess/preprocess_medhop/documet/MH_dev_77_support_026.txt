Botulinum neurotoxin A and neurotoxin E cleavage products of synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kd exhibit distinct actions on pancreatic islet beta-cell Kv2.1 channel gating . OBJECTIVES : Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kd ( P60880 ) regulates pancreatic islet beta-cell-delayed rectifier K channels ( Kv2.1 ) in addition to insulin exocytosis . Botulinum neurotoxin A ( DB00083 ) and E ( BoNT/E ) cleavage and presumed deletion of P60880 have been used to examine P60880 function . We hypothesized that proteolytic products of P60880 ( 206 amino acids ) resulting from DB00083 and BoNT/E cleavage , P60880 (1-197) and P60880 (1-180) , have independent actions on beta-cell Kv gating . METHODS : We examined by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting DB00083 and BoNT/E cleavage of P60880 to these N-terminal fragments , and the consequent effects of these BoNTs and P60880 fragments on Kv currents in rat beta cells and MIN6 cells by patch clamp electrophysiology . RESULTS : Confocal microscopy and immunoblotting showed that MIN6 cells transfected with DB00083 or BoNT/E generated P60880 (1-197) and P60880 (1-180) fragments that were retained in the cytosol . Both BoNTs caused increased rate of channel activation and slowed channel inactivation , mimicked by these P60880 fragments , but not full-length P60880 . These P60880 fragments potentiated tetraethylammonium block of beta-cell Kv currents . CONCLUSIONS : DB00083 or BoNT/E treatment of beta cells generates N-terminal P60880 fragments that are retained in beta cells to directly influence Kv channel gating in a manner distinct from full-length P60880 , contributing to overall actions of these BoNTs on insulin secretion .
