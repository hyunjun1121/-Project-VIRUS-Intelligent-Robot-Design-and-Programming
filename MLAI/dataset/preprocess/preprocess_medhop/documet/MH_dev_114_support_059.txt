An open-label trial of the P37231 ligand rosiglitazone for active ulcerative colitis . OBJECTIVES : Previous research has demonstrated that ligands for the gamma subtype of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) reduce inflammation in two different murine models of colitis . This study was designed to examine the potential efficacy of rosiglitazone , a ligand for the gamma subtype of PPARs , as a therapy for active ulcerative colitis . METHODS : Fifteen patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis despite therapy with DB00244 compounds were enrolled in an open-label study of rosiglitazone ( 4 mg b.i.d. p.o. ) for 12 wk . Thirteen of 15 patients were receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulator medications . Disease activity was measured with the Disease Activity Index . RESULTS : After 12 wk of therapy , four patients ( 27 % ) had achieved clinical remission , of whom three ( 20 % ) also had an endoscopic remission . Four additional patients ( 27 % ) had a clinical response without achieving remission . Two patients were hospitalized with worsened disease activity , and one patient was withdrawn for nephrotic syndrome . CONCLUSIONS : These data suggest that ligands for the gamma subtype of PPARs may represent a novel therapy for ulcerative colitis . A double blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial is warranted .
