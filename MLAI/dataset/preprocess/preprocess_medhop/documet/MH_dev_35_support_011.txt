FTY720 induces apoptosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells via dual activation of O43521 and P55957 and overcomes various types of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors . PP2A activator FTY720 has been shown to possess the anti-leukemic activity for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , however , the cell killing mechanism underlying its anti-leukemic activity has remained to be verified . We investigated the precise mechanisms underlying the apoptosis induction by FTY720 , especially focusing on the roles of BH3-only proteins , and the therapeutic potency of FTY720 for CML . Enforced expression of either P10415 or the dominant-negative protein of Q13158 ( Q13158 .DN ) partly protected CML cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , indicating the involvement of both cell extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways . FTY720 activates pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins : O43521 , which is essential for apoptosis by P11274 - P00519 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , and P55957 , which accelerates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway . Gene knockdown of either O43521 or P55957 partly protected K562 cells from apoptosis by FTY720 , but the extent of cell protection was not as much as that by overexpression of either P10415 or Q13158 .DN . Moreover , knockdown of both O43521 and P55957 did not provide additional protection compared with knockdown of only O43521 or P55957 , indicating that O43521 and P55957 complement each other in apoptosis by FTY720 , especially when either is functionally impaired . FTY720 can overcome TKI resistance caused by P00519 kinase domain mutations , dysfunction of O43521 resulting from gene deletion polymorphism , and galectin-3 overexpression . In addition , DB05764 , a BH3-mimetic , significantly augmented cell death induction by FTY720 both in TKI-sensitive and -resistant leukemic cells . These results provide the rationale that FTY720 , with its unique effects on O43521 and P55957 , could lead to new therapeutic strategies for CML .
