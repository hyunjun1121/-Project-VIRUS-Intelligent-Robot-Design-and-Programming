Gene therapy for brain tumors : basic developments and clinical implementation . Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is the most common and deadliest of adult primary brain tumors . Due to its invasive nature and sensitive location , complete resection remains virtually impossible . The resistance of GBM against chemotherapy and radiotherapy necessitate the development of novel therapies . Gene therapy is proposed for the treatment of brain tumors and has demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy in animal models . Here we review the various experimental therapies that have been developed for GBM including both cytotoxic and immune stimulatory approaches . We also review the combined conditional cytotoxic immune stimulatory therapy that our lab has developed which is dependent on the adenovirus mediated expression of the conditional cytotoxic gene , Herpes Simplex Type 1 DB04485 Kinase ( TK ) and the powerful DC growth factor P36888 ligand ( P49771 ) . Combined delivery of these vectors elicits tumor cell death and an anti-tumor adaptive immune response that requires O60603 activation . The implications of our studies indicate that the combined cytotoxic and immunotherapeutic strategies are effective strategies to combat deadly brain tumors and warrant their implementation in human Phase I clinical trials for GBM .
