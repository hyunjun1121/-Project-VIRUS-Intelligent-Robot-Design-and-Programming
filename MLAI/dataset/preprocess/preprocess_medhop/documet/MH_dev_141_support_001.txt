Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the novel P25116 antagonist vorapaxar ( formerly P35240 530348 ) in healthy subjects . PURPOSE : The aim of our study was to evaluate the pharmacology of vorapaxar ( P35240 530348 ) , an oral P25116 antagonist , in healthy volunteers . METHODS AND RESULTS : In two randomized , placebo-controlled studies , subjects received either single ascending doses of vorapaxar ( 0.25 , 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 mg ; n = 50 ) , multiple ascending doses of vorapaxar ( 1 , 3 , or 5 mg/day for 28 days ; n = 36 ) , a loading dose ( 10 or 20 mg ) followed by daily maintenance doses ( 1 mg ) for 6 days ( n = 12 ) , or placebo . Single 20- and 40-mg doses of vorapaxar completely inhibited thrombin receptor activating peptide ( TRAP ) -induced platelet aggregation ( > 80 % inhibition ) at 1 h and sustained this level of inhibition for â‰¥72 h . Multiple doses yielded complete inhibition on Day 1 ( 5 mg/day ) and Day 7 ( 1 and 3 mg/day ) . Adverse events were generally mild , transient , and unrelated to dose . CONCLUSION : DB09030 provided rapid and sustained dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation without affecting bleeding or clotting times .
