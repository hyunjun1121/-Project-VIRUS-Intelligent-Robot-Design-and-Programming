Association of platelet P08514 and P05106 polymorphisms with ex vivo antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects . DB08816 ( Q8NDX1 ) is the first reversible Q9H244 receptor antagonist that exhibits rapid antiplatelet effect by indirect inhibition of the P08514 /IIIa complex . Polymorphisms in genes coding P08514 /IIIa , namely P08514 and P05106 , are associated with aspirin resistance and risk for thrombotic diseases . We assessed whether P08514 and P05106 polymorphisms can influence the ex vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in Chinese population . A total of 196 healthy Chinese male individuals were recruited . ADP-induced platelet aggregation was determined using optical aggregometry at baseline and after incubation of the platelet-rich plasma with 15 and 50 μM ticagrelor , respectively . Single nucleotide polymorphisms in P08514 ( rs5911 G > T ) and P05106 ( rs4642 A > G and rs4634 G > A ) were genotyped by sequencing . Q8NDX1 at both concentrations of 15 and 50 μM decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation significantly ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) . As compared to P08514 rs5911 GG homozygotes , individuals with the rs5911 TG genotype showed significantly increased inhibition of platelet aggregation ( IPA ) by both 15 and 50 μM ticagrelor incubation ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) . Neither rs4642 nor rs4634 polymorphism affected ticagrelor-induced IPA . We suggest that the P08514 rs5911 GG genotype is associated with decreased ex vivo antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor in healthy Chinese male subjects .
