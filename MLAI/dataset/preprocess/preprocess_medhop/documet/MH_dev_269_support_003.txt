Role of DB05875 signaling in enhanced nociceptive sensitization and local cytokine production after incision . Substance P ( SP ) signaling facilitates nociceptive sensitization in various inflammatory and chronic pain models and we postulated that SP signaling might also contribute to the development of post-incisional hyperalgesia . These studies used mice with a deletion of the pre-protachykinin A gene ( ppt-A(-/-) ) which codes for SP to determine the role of SP signaling in post-incisional pain and in the increased cytokine and nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) expression observed in the incised skin . SP deficient ppt-A(-/-) mice displayed reduced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia compared to the wild-type ( wt ) mice at all post-incision time points , despite similar baseline values ( p < 0.001 ) . Furthermore , the P25103 antagonist LY303870 attenuated mechanical allodynia produced by incision in the wt mice ( p < 0.001 ) . Incision also up-regulated P05231 , P01375 and KC levels but not IL-1beta after 2h in the wt mice skin . However , ppt-A(-/-) mice had more skin P01138 levels 2h post-incision . Subcutaneous hind paw SP injection produced acute and transient elevations of IL-1beta , P05231 , and KC but modest elevations in P01375 levels in the wt mice . Systemic LY303870 reversed the SP-induced elevations of these cytokines . Hind paw injection of P05231 and P01138 dose dependently produced less mechanical allodynia in the ppt-A(-/-) compared to wt mice . Additionally , SP produced mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent fashion in wt mice . Therefore , SP supports nociceptive sensitization after hind paw incision and potentially participates directly in modulating the intensity of inflammatory response in peri-incisional tissue .
