Phosphorylation of the ARE-binding protein Q96EP5 by P28482 induces its dissociation from Q9NQZ3 . A protein in RAW 264.7 macrophages , which became phosphorylated in response to LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) , was identified as the RNA-binding protein called Q96EP5 [ Q9NQZ3 ( deleted in azoospermia ) -associated protein 1 ] . The phosphorylation of this protein was prevented by specific inhibition of Q02750 [ MAPK ( mitogen-activated protein kinase ) kinase 1 ] , indicating that it was phosphorylated via the classical MAPK cascade . Further experiments showed that Q96EP5 was phosphorylated stoichiometrically in vitro by P28482 ( extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 2 ) at two DB00156 -Pro sequences ( Thr269 and Thr315 ) , and that both sites became phosphorylated in P29320 -293 ( human embryonic kidney 293 ) cells in response to PMA or P01133 ( epidermal growth factor ) , or RAW 264.7 macrophages in response to LPS . Phosphorylation induced by each stimulus was prevented by two structurally distinct inhibitors of Q02750 ( PD184352 and U0126 ) , demonstrating that Q96EP5 is a physiological substrate for P27361 / P28482 . The mutation of Thr269 and Thr315 to aspartate or the phosphorylation of these residues caused Q96EP5 to dissociate from its binding partner Q9NQZ3 . Q9NQZ3 interacts with PABP [ poly(A)-binding protein ] and thereby stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing short poly(A) tails [ Collier , Gorgoni , Loveridge , Cooke and Gray ( 2005 ) EMBO J. 24 , 2656-2666 ] . In the present study we have shown that Q9NQZ3 can not bind simultaneously to Q96EP5 and PABP , and suggest that the phosphorylation-induced dissociation of Q9NQZ3 and Q96EP5 may allow the former to stimulate translation by interacting with PABP .
