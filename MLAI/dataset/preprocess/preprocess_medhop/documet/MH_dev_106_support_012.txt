Effect of DB02527 on TGFbeta1-induced corneal keratocyte-myofibroblast transformation . PURPOSE : TGFbeta is the major mediator to induce myofibroblast differentiation in the corneal wound-healing process . Elevated DB02527 can reduce TGFbeta-induced fibrosis in other tissues . This study was conducted to determine whether elevated DB02527 can inhibit TGFbeta1-induced rabbit corneal keratocyte-myofibroblast transformation . METHODS : Primary isolated rabbit corneal keratocytes were cultured in serum-free medium . The effects of the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin ( FSK ; 2 microM ) on TGFbeta1 ( 5 ng/mL ) -induced alpha-smooth muscle actin ( alpha-SMA ) expression was examined by immunofluorescence , flow cytometry , and immunochemistry 72 hours after treatment . The effects of TGFbeta+FSK on activated pSmad3 , CREB binding protein ( CBP ) , MAPKs , and RhoA were determined by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot . RESULTS : FSK significantly reduced the myofibroblast phenotype and alpha-SMA expression induced by TGFbeta1 in rabbit corneal keratocytes . TGFbeta1 increased the phosphorylation of P29323 and P84022 . TGFbeta1-induced alpha-SMA expression was reduced by MEK inhibition ( U0126 ) ; however , the levels of pERK , pSmad3 , or the extent of the interaction between pSmad3 and CBP induced by TGFbeta1 were not affected by FSK . TGFbeta1 also activated RhoA and ROCK ( Y27632 ) inhibition reduced alpha-SMA expression . Activation of RhoA was significantly reduced by FSK . CONCLUSIONS : Raising DB02527 by FSK treatment inhibits the TGFbeta1-induced corneal myofibroblast transformation and alpha-SMA expression and thereby provides a promising method to control corneal fibrosis . The data suggest that DB02527 -dependent inhibition does not occur by altering Smads or MAPK signaling , but possibly by reducing the activation of RhoA .
