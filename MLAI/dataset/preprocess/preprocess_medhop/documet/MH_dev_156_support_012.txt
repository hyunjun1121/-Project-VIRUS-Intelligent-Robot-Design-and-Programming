Inhibition of myoblast migration by prostacyclin is associated with enhanced cell fusion . Satellite cells are stem cells that are critical for the formation and growth of skeletal muscle during myogenesis . To differentiate and fuse , proliferating satellite cells or myoblasts must migrate and establish stable cell-cell contacts . However , the factors that regulate myoblast migration and fusion are not understood completely . We have identified DB01240 as a novel regulator of myogenesis in vitro . DB01240 is a member of the family of prostaglandins ( PG ) , autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules synthesized via the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 pathways . Primary mouse muscle cells both secrete DB01240 and express the P43119 , IP , at various stages of myogenesis . Using genetic and pharmacological approaches , we show that DB01240 is a negative regulator of myoblast migration that also enhances cell fusion . Thus , DB01240 may act as a " brake " on migrating cells to facilitate cell-cell contact and fusion . Together , our results highlight the importance of the balance between positive and negative regulators in cell migration and myogenesis . This work may have implications for migration of other populations of adult stem cells and/or cells that undergo fusion .
