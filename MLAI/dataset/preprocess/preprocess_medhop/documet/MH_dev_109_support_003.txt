The disulfide-rich region of platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIIa contains hydrophilic peptide sequences that bind anti- P05106 autoantibodies from patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) . Immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) is an autoimmune blood disease caused by autoantibody-mediated destruction of blood platelets . Platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa is a common target for antiplatelet autoantibodies . The present studies were undertaken (1). to confirm whether the disulfide rich repeat region of P05106 contains target epitopes for antiplatelet antibodies in patients with ITP ; (2). to determine whether these antigens were defined by peptide sequences in the absence of post-translational modification ; and (3). to correlate observed immunologic reactivity with the recently solved X-ray crystallographic structure of an analogous integrin complex , the vitronectin receptor , alpha(V)beta(3) . Recombinant fusion proteins of four P05106 extracellular sequences were prepared and purified . Immunoblotting results with purified recombinant peptides showed potent reactivity of 16 of 24 ITP patient serum anti- P08514 /IIIa antibodies with the fusion protein containing the P05106 sequence of residues from 468 to 691 . These results are consistent with a report by Kekomaki et al. that a 50 kDa chymotryptic digestion product of P05106 isolated from blood platelets contains target epitopes for serum antiplatelet antibodies in 16 of 33 ITP patients . Smaller peptides including residues 446-501 and residues 593-691 each reacted with only 5 of the 24 patient sera ; furthermore all but 3 of these interactions were very weak . Visualization of the conformation of the extracellular portion of alpha(V)beta(3) reveals the location of the 222-residue antigenic P05106 ( beta(3) ) peptide ' B ' at the immediately extracellular region of the protein that includes a beta-tail domain and several integrin- P01133 domains . In summary , predictions of hydrophilicity , surface accessibility and antigenicity and the three dimensional structure of the beta(3) integrin correlate with autoantibody binding to a recombinant P05106 peptide ' B ' containing residues 468-691 .
