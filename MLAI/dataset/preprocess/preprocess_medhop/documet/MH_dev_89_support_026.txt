Purification and characterization of a high molecular weight histone deacetylase complex ( Q92769 ) of maize embryos . The dynamic state of core histone acetylation is maintained by histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases . In germinating maize embryos , four nuclear histone deacetylases can be distinguished . From a chromatin fraction prepared at 72 h after start of embryo germination , we have purified the nuclear histone deacetylase Q92769 to homogeneity . Using a sequence of chromatographic steps , we achieved the purification of an enzymatically active high molecular weight protein complex with an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa , as determined by gel filtration chromatography . The purified enzyme was characterized in terms of enzymatic and kinetic properties , and sensitivity to several histone deacetylase inhibitors . In SDS-polyacrylamide gels , Q92769 split into three polypeptides of 45 , 42 , and 39 kDa , suggesting that the native enzyme is a multimer-protein complex . Electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions in combination with second dimension SDS-gel electrophoresis indicated that all three protein components of the Q92769 complex were enzymatically active . Polyclonal antibodies against each of the three polypeptides were raised in rabbits . Each antiserum reacted with all three polypeptides on Western blots , suggesting that P29466 , Q8NFH3 , and p39 are highly homologous . This homology was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of peptides generated from each of the three Q92769 components .
