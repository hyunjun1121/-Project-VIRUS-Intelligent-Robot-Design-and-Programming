P16150 - , but not P16150 + , P22301 -producing CD1dhiCD5+ B cells suppress type 1 immune responses during Chlamydia muridarum genital tract infection . Regulatory B ( Breg ) cells are known to modulate immune responses through predominantly interleukin-10 ( P22301 ) -dependent mechanisms and can be hypothetically divided into innate and adaptive subsets based on the nature of their activating signals . However , the specific role of different Breg subsets in modulating immune responses remains ambiguous . Here we have shown that Chlamydia induces P22301 -producing splenic B-cell populations consisting of P16150 (+) and P16150 (-) subsets of IgM(hi)IgD(lo) innate-like B ( ILB ) cells in vitro . While P16150 (+) P22301 -producing B cells displayed innate type features and were readily induced by Chlamydia via Toll-like-receptor ( TLR ) signaling , P16150 (-) P22301 -producing B cells required additional B-cell activating factor ( Q9Y275 ) -mediated signals from dendritic cells ( DCs ) for their differentiation and activation , thereby classifying them as adaptive type Bregs . Importantly , P16150 (-) , but not P16150 (+) , P22301 -producing ILB cells displayed bona fide Breg activity by potently suppressing interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) production in vitro in an P22301 -dependent manner . Furthermore , a novel P16150 (-)CD1d(hi) P06127 (+) P22301 -producing Breg population was predominantly induced by Chlamydia genital infection in vivo . Correspondingly , mixed bone marrow chimeric mice with B-cell-specific P22301 deficiency exhibited significantly increased type 1 immune responses , decreased bacterial burden , and reduced oviduct pathology upon infection . Our data demonstrate for the first time a distinct role for P16150 (-)CD1d(hi) P06127 (+)-adaptive Bregs over P16150 (+) innate counterparts in controlling mucosal responses against intracellular bacterial infection .
