Role of cardiovascular aldosterone in hypertension . DB04630 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease . We have reported that aldosterone is synthesized in cardiovascular tissues and local aldosterone synthesis plays important roles for hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy . High sodium intake develops and accelerates vascular injury and cardiac hypertrophy in SHRSP . Plasma aldosterone concentrations and P06703 were decreased by high salt intake in SHRSP . DB04630 production , the expression of P19099 mRNA and angiotensin II receptor AT1R mRNA in blood vessels were significantly increased by high salt intake . These results suggest that high salt intake increases aldosterone production and expression of the AT1R mRNA in the vascular tissue in SHRSP , which may contribute to the development of malignant hypertension in salt-loaded SHRSP . However , there are several reports of conflicting data . P08235 ( MR ) binding is tightly regulated by the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 11beta-HSD2 ) which selectively metabolizes glucocorticoids to inactive metabolites , thus allowing for MR activation by aldosterone . We have reported that decreased 11beta-HSD2 in blood vessels in Dahl salt-sensitive ( DS ) rats , a model for salt-sensitive hypertension . Local aldosterone excess may play a significant role in the salt sensitivity and development of hypertension . High sodium intake decreased circulating rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increased blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in DS rats , which were prevented by the treatment with a selective MR antagonist , eplerenone . DB00700 also improved endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) activity and P29474 mRNA expression in blood vessels in DS rats . These results further suggest that not only circulating aldosterone but also local aldosterone is of critical importance in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders .
