Influence of major structural features of tocopherols and tocotrienols on their omega-oxidation by tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase . Human cytochrome P450 4F2 ( P78329 ) catalyzes the initial omega-hydroxylation reaction in the metabolism of tocopherols and tocotrienols to carboxychromanols and is , to date , the only enzyme shown to metabolize vitamin E . The objective of this study was to characterize this activity , particularly the influence of key features of tocochromanol substrate structure . The influence of the number and positions of methyl groups on the chromanol ring , and of stereochemistry and saturation of the side chain , were explored using HepG2 cultures and microsomal reaction systems . Human liver microsomes and microsomes selectively expressing recombinant human P78329 exhibited substrate activity patterns similar to those of HepG2 cells . Although activity was strongly associated with substrate accumulation by cells or microsomes , substantial differences in specific activities between substrates remained under conditions of similar microsomal membrane substrate concentration . Methylation at P01031 of the chromanol ring was associated with markedly low activity . Tocotrienols exhibited much higher Vmax values than their tocopherol counterparts . Side chain stereochemistry had no effect on omega-hydroxylation of DB00163 ( alpha-TOH ) by any system . Kinetic analysis of microsomal P78329 activity revealed Michaelis-Menten kinetics for alpha-TOH but allosteric cooperativity for other vitamers , especially tocotrienols . Additionally , alpha-TOH was a positive effector of omega-hydroxylation of other vitamers . These results indicate that P78329 -mediated tocopherol-omega-hydroxylation is a central feature underlying the different biological half-lives , and therefore biopotencies , of the tocopherols and tocotrienols .
