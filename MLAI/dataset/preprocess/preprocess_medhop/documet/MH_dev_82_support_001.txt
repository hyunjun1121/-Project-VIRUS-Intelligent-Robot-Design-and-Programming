Serum IL-1beta levels in health and disease : a population-based study . ' The InCHIANTI study ' . Interleukin-1 plays a role in normal homeostasis and in the inflammatory response which is deemed to be responsible for the development of major chronic diseases that are highly prevalent in the elderly . Aim of this study is to evaluate the factors influencing the serum levels of P01584 , in a large and representative population . Data were from the InCHIANTI project , a study of factors contributing to the decline of mobility in late life , which sampled people living in two sites in the surroundings of Florence . Blood samples were obtained from 1,292 participants and frozen aliquots were stored at -80 degrees C . The serum levels of several cytokines were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using an ultrasensitive commercial kit . P01584 serum levels were associated with congestive heart failure ( p > 0.001 ) and angina ( p = 0.02 ) , with Ca2+ serum levels ( p = 0.02 ) , and with a history of dyslipidemia ( p = 0.05 ) . We found no association between serum IL-1beta level and age , sex , consumption of cardioactive drugs and serum levels of IL-1Ra , P05231 , sIL-6R , P22301 and P01375 . Our data could lend support to the hypothesis that IL-1beta is mainly involved in the functional alterations of cardiomyocytes under conditions marked by mononuclear cell infiltration and by downregulation of calcium .
