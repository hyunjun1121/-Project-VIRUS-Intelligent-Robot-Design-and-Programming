Calorie restriction promotes mammalian cell survival by inducing the Q96EB6 deacetylase . A major cause of aging is thought to result from the cumulative effects of cell loss over time . In yeast , caloric restriction ( CR ) delays aging by activating the Sir2 deacetylase . Here we show that expression of mammalian Sir2 ( Q96EB6 ) is induced in CR rats as well as in human cells that are treated with serum from these animals . P01308 and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( DB01277 ) attenuated this response . Q96EB6 deacetylates the DNA repair factor P12956 , causing it to sequester the proapoptotic factor Bax away from mitochondria , thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptotic cell death . Thus , CR could extend life-span by inducing Q96EB6 expression and promoting the long-term survival of irreplaceable cells .
