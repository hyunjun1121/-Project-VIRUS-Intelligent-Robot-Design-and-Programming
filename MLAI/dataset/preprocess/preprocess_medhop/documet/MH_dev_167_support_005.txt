TGFbeta1 , TNFalpha , and insulin signaling crosstalk in regulation of the rat cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene expression . The TGFbeta1/Smad pathway plays a critical role in cholestasis and liver fibrosis . Previous studies show that TGFbeta1 , TNFalpha , and insulin inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) gene transcription and bile acid synthesis in human hepatocytes . In this study , we investigated insulin , TGFbeta1 , and TNFalpha regulation of rat Cyp7a1 gene transcription . In contrast to inhibition of human P22680 gene transcription , TGFbeta1 stimulates rat Cyp7a1 reporter activity . P84022 , FoxO1 , and HNF4alpha synergistically stimulated rat Cyp7a1 gene transcription . Mutations of the P84022 , FoxO1 , or HNF4alpha binding site attenuated the rat Cyp7a1 promoter activity . Furthermore , TNFalpha and cJun attenuated TGFbeta1 stimulation of rat Cyp7a1 . P01308 or adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active P31749 inhibited FoxO1 and P84022 synergy . In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats , Cyp7a1 mRNA expression levels were induced and insulin attenuated P22680 mRNA levels . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that FoxO1 binding to Cyp7a1 chromatin was increased in diabetic rat livers and insulin reduced FoxO1 binding . These results suggest a mechanistic basis for induction of Cyp7a1 activity and bile acid synthesis in cholestatic rats and in diabetic rats . The crosstalk of insulin , TGFbeta and TNFalpha signaling pathways may regulate bile acid synthesis and lipid homeostasis in diabetes , fatty liver disease , and liver fibrosis .
