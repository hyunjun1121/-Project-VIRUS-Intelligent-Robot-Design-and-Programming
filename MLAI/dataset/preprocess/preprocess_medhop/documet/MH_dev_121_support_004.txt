17β-estradiol inhibits P14780 and Q09428 /TrpM4 expression and activation and thereby attenuates BSCB disruption/hemorrhage after spinal cord injury in male rats . Blood-spinal cord barrier ( BSCB ) disruption and progressive hemorrhage after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) lead to secondary injury and the subsequent apoptosis and/or necrosis of neuron and glia , causing permanent neurological deficits . In this study , we examined the effect of 17β-estradiol ( E2 ) on BSCB breakdown and hemorrhage as well as subsequent inflammation after SCI . After a moderate contusion injury at the 9th thoracic segment of spinal cord , E2 ( 300 μg/kg ) was administered by iv injection immediately after SCI , and the same dose of E2 was then administered 6 and 24 hours after injury . Our data show that E2 attenuated BSCB permeability and hemorrhage and reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and macorphages after SCI . Consistent with this finding , the expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly reduced by E2 . Furthermore , E2 treatment significantly inhibited the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 after injury , which are known to mediate hemorrhage at an early stage after SCI . Moreover , the expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease-9 after injury , which is known to disrupt BSCB , and the degradation of tight junction proteins , such as zona occludens-1 and occludin , were significantly inhibited by E2 treatment . Furthermore , the protective effects of E2 on BSCB disruption and functional improvement were abolished by an estrogen receptor antagonist , ICI 182780 ( 3 mg/kg ) . Thus , our study provides evidence that the neuroprotective effect of E2 after SCI is , in part , mediated by inhibiting BSCB disruption and hemorrhage through the down-regulation of sulfonylurea receptor 1/transient receptor potential melastatin 4 and matrix metalloprotease-9 , which is dependent on estrogen receptor .
