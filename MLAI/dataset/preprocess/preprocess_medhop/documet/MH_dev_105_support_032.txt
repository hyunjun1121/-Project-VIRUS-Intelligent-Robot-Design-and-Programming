Novel drugs against non-small-cell lung cancer . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Important therapeutic advances for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) with focus on individualized therapy have recently occurred and are summarized in this review . RECENT FINDINGS : Cetuximab added to first-line chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with high epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) expression in their tumors . DB08916 has shown improved progression-free survival and better quality of life compared to chemotherapy in patients with P00533 -mutation-positive adenocarcinomas . Several other P00533 -directed agents are in clinical development . DB08865 improved progression-free survival compared to second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed in patients with advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive NSCLC . Selumetinib added to docetaxel has improved outcome compared with docetaxel in a randomized phase II trial in patients with advanced P01116 -mutant NSCLC and this combination is currently studied in a phase III trial . DB09079 added to docetaxel improved progression-free survival in the second-line therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC but many other angiogenesis inhibitors failed to improve clinical outcome in phase III trials . Several other targeted therapies are currently evaluated in phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC . SUMMARY : Recent trials have led to the approval of afatinib and crizotinib for subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC .
