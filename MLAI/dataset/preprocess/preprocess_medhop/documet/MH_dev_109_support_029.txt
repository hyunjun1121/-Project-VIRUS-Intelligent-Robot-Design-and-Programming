Q13444 is an adhesion receptor for platelet P08514 -IIIa and induces platelet activation . Cell adhesion and proteolytic matrix degradation are central processes in atherosclerosis . Being a member of the family of ADAMs ( " a disintegrin and metalloproteinase " ) , metargidin ( Q13444 ) combines a metalloproteinase domain and an RGD aminoacid sequence . We studied the potential role of Q13444 as an adhesion receptor on endothelial cells and interactions between platelets and Q13444 with respect to platelet adhesion , activation and thrombus formation . Q13444 was found to be expressed on cultured endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) . Platelet adhesion to immobilized recombinant Q13444 was effectively enhanced under both static and high shear rate conditions reaching the maximum level of adhesion to fibrinogen . Consistently , platelet adhesion onto Q13444 overexpressing endothelial cells was significantly increased . Adhesion to Q13444 was reduced by blockade of P08514 -IIIa using neutralizing anti-alpha(IIb)beta3 mAbs ( DB00054 , 2G12 ) , but not by anti-alpha(v)beta3 ( LM609 ) . Soluble Q13444 binds to activated but not to resting P08514 -IIIa . Moreover , platelets adherent to Q13444 additionally attracted platelets under high shear rates indicating an initial role of platelet- Q13444 interactions for thrombus formation . Furthermore , incubation of platelets with soluble Q13444 showed a dose-dependent increase in secretion of CD62P and P29965 . Q13444 is expressed on endothelial cells and can serve as an adhesion receptor for platelets via P08514 -IIIa binding . Platelet adhesion to Q13444 leads to platelet activation , secretion and promotes thrombus formation . Thus , Q13444 may represent a novel target for antithrombotic strategies in cardiovascular pathologies .
