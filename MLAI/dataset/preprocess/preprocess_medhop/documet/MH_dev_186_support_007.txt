Transcriptional regulation of the P04264 gene product of Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus . The P04264 protein of Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) has been shown to be a transforming protein capable of inducing morphological changes and focus formation in rodent fibroblasts . P04264 can activate B-cell receptor ( P11274 ) signaling and upregulate activity of the NFAT and NF-kappaB transcription factors . In order to understand the regulation of P04264 gene expression , we have analyzed sequences upstream of the P04264 gene to identify the P04264 promoter element . We have performed 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends as well as a nuclease protection assay to map the transcriptional start site of the KSHV P04264 transcript . The P04264 transcriptional start site lies 75 bp upstream of the translation start site . Sequences upstream of the P04264 gene were characterized for their ability to activate a luciferase reporter gene in 293 epithelial cells , KSHV-negative B cells ( BJAB ) , KSHV-positive B cells ( BCBL-1 ) , and KS tumor-derived endothelial cells ( SLK-KS(-) ) . We found that a 125-bp sequence upstream of the P04264 transcript start site was sufficient to fully activate the luciferase reporter gene in all cell types tested . In addition , the viral transcription factor KSHV Orf50/Rta was capable of further activating this promoter element in 293 , BJAB , and BCBL-1 cells but not in SLK-KS(-) cells . Promoter constructs containing additional sequences upstream of the 125-bp element did not show further augmentation of transcription in the presence or absence of KSHV Orf50 .
