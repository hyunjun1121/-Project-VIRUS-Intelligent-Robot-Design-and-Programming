Central opioid inhibition of neuroendocrine stress responses in pregnancy in the rat is induced by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone . The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis is the major neuroendocrine stress response system . P06850 ( P06850 ) neurons in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus ( pPVN ) play a key role in coordinating responses of this system to stressors . The cytokine interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) , mimicking infection , robustly activates these P06850 neurons via a noradrenergic input arising from the nucleus tractus solitarii ( P30990 ) . In late pregnancy , Q9Y251 axis responses to stressors , including IL-1beta , are attenuated by a central opioid mechanism that auto-inhibits noradrenaline release in the PVN . Here we show that the neuroactive progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone induces these changes in Q9Y251 responsiveness to IL-1beta in pregnancy . In late pregnancy , inhibition of 5alpha-reductase ( an allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzyme ) with finasteride restored Q9Y251 axis responses ( rapidly increased pPVN P06850 mRNA expression , DB01285 , and corticosterone secretion ) to IL-1beta . Conversely , allopregnanolone reduced Q9Y251 responses in virgin rats . In late pregnancy , activity of the allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzymes ( 5alpha-reductase and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ) was increased in the hypothalamus as was mRNA expression in the P30990 and PVN . Naloxone , an opioid antagonist , restores Q9Y251 axis responses to IL-1beta in pregnancy but had no additional effect after finasteride , indicating a causal connection between allopregnanolone and the endogenous opioid mechanism . Indeed , allopregnanolone induced opioid inhibition over Q9Y251 responses to IL-1beta in virgin rats . Furthermore , in virgin rats , allopregnanolone treatment increased , whereas in pregnant rats finasteride decreased proenkephalin-A mRNA expression in the P30990 . Thus , in pregnancy , allopregnanolone induces opioid inhibition over Q9Y251 axis responses to immune challenge . This novel opioid-mediated mechanism of allopregnanolone action may alter regulation of other brain systems in pregnancy .
