P35367 occupancy in human brains after single oral doses of histamine H1 antagonists measured by positron emission tomography . 1. P35367 occupancy in the human brain was measured in 20 healthy young men by positron emission tomography ( PET ) using [ 11C ] -doxepin . 2 . (+)- DB01114 , a selective and classical antihistamine , occupied 76.8 +/- 4.2 % of the averaged values of available histamine H1 receptors in the frontal cortex after its administration in a single oral dose of 2 mg . Intravenous administration of 5 mg (+)-chlorpheniramine almost completely abolished the binding of [ 11C ] -doxepin to H1 receptors ( H1 receptor occupancy : 98.2 +/- 1.2 % ) . 3 . Terfenadine , a nonsedative antihistamine , occupied 17.2 +/- 14.2 % of the available H1 receptors in the human frontal cortex after its administration in a single oral dose of 60 mg . 4 . There was no correlation between H1 receptor occupancy by terfenadine and the plasma concentration of the active acid metabolite of terfenadine in each subject . 5 . PET data on human brain were essentially compatible with those on H1 receptor occupancy in guinea-pig brain determined by in vivo binding techniques , although for the same H1 receptor occupancy the dose was less in human subjects than in guinea-pigs . 6 . The PET studies demonstrated the usefulness of measuring H1 receptor occupancy with classical and second-generation antihistamines in human brain to estimate their unwanted side effects such as sedation and drowsiness quantitatively .
