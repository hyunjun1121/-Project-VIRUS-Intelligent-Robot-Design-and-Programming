Comparisons between the beneficial effects of different sulphonylurea treatments on ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization . The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of gliclazide and other sulphonylureas on ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization . To produce an animal model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy , 7-day-old ( Q0GE19 ) mice were exposed to a 75 % oxygen environment for 5 days . On their return to ambient air at P12 , these mice were then treated with gliclazide , glibenclamide , glimepiride , or DB06151 . DB01120 , but not glibenclamide or glimepiride , markedly suppresses retinal neovascularization . N-Acetylcysteine , however , only moderately suppresses retinal neovascularization . The number of neovascular nuclei in the retinal cross sections decreased by 29 % in the gliclazide-treated mice ( P < 0.05 vs control ) . The induction of P15692 mRNA expression at P13 is significantly suppressed in the gliclazide group , relative to the control group ( -44 % , P < 0.05 ) . The P15692 protein expression levels at P15 were also suppressed in the gliclazide group ( -43 % , P < 0.01 ) . The 8-isoprostane production levels at P15 were suppressed in both the gliclazide group ( -20 % , P < 0.05 ) and the DB06151 -treated group ( -31 % , P < 0.01 ) . DB01120 inhibits ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization , and this is likely to be mediated in part through the downregulation of P15692 and the suppression of oxidative stress .
