Synthesis of new thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidines as DB01285 releasing factor modulators . P06850 ( CRF ) is a neurohormone that plays a crucial role in integrating the body 's overall response to stress . It appears necessary and sufficient for the organism to mount functional , physiological and endocrine responses to stressors . CRF is released in response to various triggers such as chronic stress . The role of CRF and its involvement in these neurological disorders suggest that new drugs that can target the CRF function or bind to its receptors may represent a new development of neuropsychiatric medicines to treat various stress-related disorders including depression , anxiety and addictive disorders . Based on pharmacophore of the CRF1 receptor antagonists , a new series of thiazolo[4,5-d] pyrimidines were synthesized as P06850 ( CRF ) receptor modulators and the prepared compounds carry groups shown to produce optimum binding affinity to CRF receptors . Twenty two compounds were evaluated for their CRF1 receptor binding affinity in P29320 293 cell lines and two compounds 5o and 5s showed approximately 25 % binding affinity to CRF1 receptors . Selected compounds ( 5c and 5f ) were also evaluated for their effect on expression of genes associated with depression and anxiety disorders such as CRF1 , P16220 , P21397 , P31645 , P01303 , DatSLC6a3 , and P09172 and significant upregulation of CRF1 mRNA has been observed with compound 5c .
