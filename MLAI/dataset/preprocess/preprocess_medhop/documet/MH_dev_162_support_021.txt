Genetics of idiopathic disseminated bronchiectasis . Bronchiectasis is an abnormal dilation of bronchi , consequent to the destruction of their walls . It is included in the category of obstructive pulmonary diseases , along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , asthma , and cystic fibrosis . In approximately 50 % of cases , bronchiectasis is associated with underlying conditions ; in the remainder , known causes are not ascertainable ( idiopathic bronchiectasis ) . A search for genetic determinants of this phenotype , with the cystic fibrosis gene as a candidate , has been performed by three independent groups . The results of this search agreed on the association of bronchiectasis with cystic fibrosis gene mutations and polymorphisms . The cystic fibrosis gene is also associated with bronchiectasis due to rheumatoid arthritis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis . A few other genes have been investigated in idiopathic bronchiectasis , with negative results . Idiopathic bronchiectasis is , therefore , to be considered as an obstructive multifactorial disorder belonging to the category of cystic fibrosis monosymptomatic diseases ( or P13569 -opathies ) , whose pathogenesis is influenced by environmental factors and other undetermined genes .
