DB00065 as rescue medication for patients with severe ulcerative/indeterminate colitis refractory to tacrolimus . BACKGROUND : The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus and the anti- P01375 -antibody infliximab are established options in steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . AIM : To evaluate the efficacy of infliximab-salvage therapy in patients with refractory UC failing to respond to tacrolimus . METHODS : Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this evaluation . Reasons for tacrolimus therapy were steroid-refractory disease in 19 patients and steroid-dependency in five patients . All patients receiving infliximab had tacrolimus-refractory active disease ( Lichtiger score > 10 ) and were treated with 5 mg/kg at weeks 0 , 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter , if tolerated . RESULTS : Six of 24 patients ( 25 % ) achieved remission following infliximab infusion and four of 24 ( 17 % ) had an initial response only , but underwent proctocolectomy later because of loss of response ( 3 ) or development of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction ( 1 ) . Fourteen patients ( 58 % ) completely failed to respond with 10 undergoing colectomy . Eight patients experienced side effects under infliximab , including two infectious complications ( herpes zoster and herpes pneumonia ) . CONCLUSIONS : DB00065 offers a therapeutic option as rescue therapy in about a quarter of patients with active UC after failing to respond to tacrolimus . This benefit has to be weighed against the risks of infectious complications .
