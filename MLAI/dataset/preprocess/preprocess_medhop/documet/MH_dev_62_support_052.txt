Targeting nanomedicines in the treatment of Crohn 's disease : focus on certolizumab pegol ( DB08904 ) . A variety of targets for therapeutic intervention are based upon advances in understanding of the immunopathogenesis of Crohn 's disease . Crohn 's disease is initiated by an innate immune response , which eventuates in a T-cell driven process , characterized by a T-helper cell 1 type cytokine profile . Several new treatments now focus on suppressing T-cell differentiation or T-cell inflammation . Since inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) represents a state of dysregulated inflammation , drugs that augment the anti-inflammatory response have the potential to downregulate inflammation and thereby hopefully modify the disease . Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) is a major target of research and clinical investigation . P01375 has proinflammatory effects in the intestinal mucosa and is a pivotal cytokine in the inflammatory cascade . DB08904 ( DB08904 ) is a PEGylated , Fab ' fragment of a humanized anti- P01375 monoclonal antibody . PEGylation increases the half-life , reduces the requirement for frequent dosing , and possibly reduces antigenicity as well . Certolizumab has been shown in Phase III trials to achieve and maintain clinical response and remission in Crohn 's disease patients . It improves the quality of life . DB08904 will be indicated for moderately to severely active Crohn 's disease , but it is not yet licensed in Europe or the US . It is not possible to construct an algorithm for treatment , but when compared with infliximab the two principal advantages are likely to be lower immunogenicity ( as shown by anti-drug antibodies , absence of infusion reactions , and low rate of antinuclear antibodies ) , and a subcutaneous route of administration . These two factors may be sufficient to promote it up the pecking order of anti- P01375 agents .
