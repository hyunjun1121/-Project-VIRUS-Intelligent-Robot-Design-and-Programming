P06850 enhances the invasiveness and migration of Ishikawa cells , possibly by increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 . P06850 ( P06850 ) , synthesized in the hypothalamus , is also produced at several extrahypothalamic sites and in normal endometrial cells . P06850 exerts antiproliferative activity on oestrogen-dependent tumour cell lines ( Ishikawa cells and breast cancer cells ) via the P06850 receptor-1 . This study investigated the potential role of P06850 as a factor affecting endometrial migration and invasion in Ishikawa cells , and the possible mechanisms involved in this process . Increasing concentrations of P06850 ( 1 , 10 and 100 nM ) significantly reduced the proliferation of Ishikawa cells but increased the invasiveness these cells compared with the control group . All three concentrations of P06850 significantly increased matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -2 and P14780 levels in Ishikawa cells . In conclusion , P06850 inhibited the growth of Ishikawa cells but enhanced their invasiveness , possibly by increasing P08253 and P14780 levels . These findings suggest that P06850 might induce invasion and migration by upregulating P08253 and P14780 in endometrial cancer .
