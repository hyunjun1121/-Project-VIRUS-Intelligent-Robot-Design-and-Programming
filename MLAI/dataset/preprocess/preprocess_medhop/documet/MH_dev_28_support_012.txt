Changes in urinary proximal tubule parameters in neonatal rats exposed to cadmium chloride during pregnancy . Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with physiological saline solution ( vehicle ) or cadmium chloride ( CdCl2 ) at 2.0 or 2.5 mg kg-1 on days 8 , 10 , 12 and 14 of gestation . On postnatal day ( P01160 ) 3 , 12 or 49 , the offspring were examined for 8- or 24-h urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin ( beta 2-m ) , metallothionein ( MT ) and urinary activity of three proximal tubular enzymes : gammaglutamyl transferase ( P19440 ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and O60502 ( NAG ) . Treatment with CdCl2 did not affect growth or survival of offspring . Significant decreases in the urinary excretion of P19440 , ALP and NAG were observed on P01160 3 , at both doses . Exposure to 4 x 2.5 mg kg-1 resulted in functional deficit of the proximal tubule on P01160 3 , as evidenced by the significant increase in beta 2-m . Except for a slight but significant increase of beta 2-m in 49-day-old males , all the other urinary parameters returned to control values on P01160 12 . There was no effect on MT . Results from this study show that prenatal exposure to CdCl2 can induce significant changes in the kidney biochemistry of rats in the early postnatal period .
