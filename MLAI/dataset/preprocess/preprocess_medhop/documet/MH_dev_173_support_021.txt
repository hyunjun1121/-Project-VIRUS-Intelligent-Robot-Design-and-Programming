A prospective case-control study analyzes 12 thrombophilic gene mutations in Turkish couples with recurrent pregnancy loss . PROBLEM : Recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) is a heterogeneous disorder . The contribution of specific thrombophilic genes to the pathophysiology of RPL has remained controversial . We evaluated the prevalences of 12 thrombophilic gene mutations among homogenous Caucasian couples with RPL and fertiles . METHOD : of study This was a prospective case-control study evaluating 272 women with RPL and 152 of their male partners , and a control group of 56 fertile couples . We investigated mutations including FV Leiden , factor V H1299R , factor II prothrombin G20210A , F XIII V34L , beta-fibrinogen -455G > A , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , P05106 L33P ( Q9Y251 -1 a/b L33P ) , P42898 C677T , P42898 A1298C , P12821 I/D , Apo B R3500Q , and Apo E . RESULTS : Overall , heterozygous mutations of FV Leiden , FXIII V34L , P05106 L33P , Apo E4 , and prothrombin G20210A and homozygous mutations of P05121 -1and P42898 C677T were associated with RPL . There was no meaningful association between RPL and other studied genes . CONCLUSION : In contrast to the other mutations and polymorphisms , FV Leiden , FXIII V34L , P05106 L33P , Apo E , prothrombin G20210A , P05121 and P42898 C677T gene mutations may help to identify the couples at risk for recurrent pregnancy loss .
