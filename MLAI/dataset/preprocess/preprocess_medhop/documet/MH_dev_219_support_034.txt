Inorganic lead enhances cytokine-induced elevation of matrix metalloproteinase P14780 expression in glial cells . Inorganic lead ( Pb ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that produces a variety of deleterious effects in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , specifically P14780 , induced by inflammatory cytokines , are increasingly being implicated in CNS pathology . The present study demonstrates that low concentrations of either pro-inflammatory cytokines ( P01375 and IL-1beta ) or Pb did not influence the P14780 expression in a glial cell line ( P13671 ) when added separately . However , combined administration of Pb and cytokines induced a marked synergized elevation of P14780 expression in spite of a reduction in the number of glial cells . These results demonstrate a possible new mechanism by which Pb may induce neuropathological processes .
