[ DB09043 ( Eperzan ) : a new once-weekly agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors ] . DB09043 ( Eperzan ) is a new once-weekly agonist of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) receptors that is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes . Two doses are available , 30 mg and 50 mg , to be injected subcutaneously once a week . It has been extensively evaluated in the HARMONY programme of eight large randomised controlled trials that were performed at different stages of type 2 diabetes , in comparison with placebo or an active comparator . The endocrine and metabolic effects of albiglutide are similar to those of other P43220 agonists : stimulation of insulin secretion ( incretin effect ) and inhibition of glucagon secretion , both in a glucose-dependent manner , retardation of gastric emptying and increase of satiety . These effects lead to a reduction in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA(1c) ) levels , combined with a weight reduction . The overall tolerance profile is good . DB09043 is currently reimbursed in Belgium after failure ( HbA(1c) > 7.5 % ) of and in combination with a dual therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea as well as in combination with a basal insulin ( with or without oral antidiabetic drugs ) . To avoid hypoglycaemia , a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be recommended . A once-weekly administration should increase patient 's acceptance of injectable therapy and improve compliance .
