Epigenetic mechanism involved in the HBV/HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection were known to be risk factors for HCC , they were suspected to promote its development by eliciting epigenetic changes . However , the precise gene targets and underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated . Epigenetic regulation of gene expression has emerged as a fundamental aspect of cancer development and progression . The molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma involve a complex interplay of both genetic and epigenetic factors . DNA methylation , post-translational modifications of histone proteins , chromatin remodeling , and noncoding RNAs are four major types of mechanistic layers in the field of epigenetics . HBV infection could affect methylation on p16(INK4A) , P09211 , CDH1( P12830 ) , RASSF1A , P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) genes , which may play important roles in the development of HCC . HCV infection was related to aberrant methylation on O15524 , Gadd45Î² , P16455 , P42224 and P25054 . Other epigenetic alterations included histone proteins , chromatin remodeling , and noncoding RNAs were described in literature . Uncovering the epigenetic alterations of HBV/HCV-induced HCC carcinogenesis could highlight a new strategy for deciphering the mechanism of HCC tumorigenesis and development , as well as a potential diagnostic advantage .
