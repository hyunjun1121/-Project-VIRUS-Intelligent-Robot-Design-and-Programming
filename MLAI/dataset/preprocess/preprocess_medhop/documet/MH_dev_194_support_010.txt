Contribution of peroxisome-specific isoform of Lon protease in sorting PTS1 proteins to peroxisomes . Using an organelle proteomics approach , we previously studied the rat peroxisome in order to characterize the proteins participating in its biogenesis . A peroxisome-specific isoform of Lon ( pLon ) protein was accordingly identified . However , the precise role of pLon in peroxisomes remains to be elucidated . Here , we demonstrate that pLon plays a role in processing and activating a specific regulatory protein belonging to the peroxisome targeting signal ( Q03393 ) 1-containing proteins . Proteomic analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Lon suggested that Lon interacts with P28288 and several enzymes involved in beta-oxidation , including acyl- DB01992 oxidase ( Q15067 ) . The processing of Q15067 for its activation in peroxisomes was strongly inhibited in cells expressing a dominant negative form of pLon . Furthermore , a catalase possessing a modified PTS1 sequence was misdistributed in this cell line . pLon exhibits little , if any , in vitro Q15067 processing activity , and does not process PTS2-containing 3-ketoacyl-coenzyme A thiolase ( P16233 ) . Therefore , pLon may specifically control , sort and process PTS1 proteins . Based on the relationship between pLon and the beta-oxidation enzymes that regulate peroxisomal morphology , the observation of enlarged peroxisomes in cells expressing recombinant pLon suggests that pLon is a critical factor determining peroxisome morphology .
