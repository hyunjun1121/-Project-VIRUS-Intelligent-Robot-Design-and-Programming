Korean Red DB01404 Extract Attenuates 3-Nitropropionic Acid-Induced Huntington's-Like Symptoms . Korean red ginseng ( KRG ) possesses neuroprotective activity . However , the potential neuroprotective value of KRG for the striatal toxicity is largely unknown . We investigated whether KRG extract ( KRGE ) could have a neuroprotective effect in a 3-nitropropionic acid- ( 3-NP ) induced ( i.p. ) Huntington 's disease ( HD ) model . KRGE ( 50 , 100 , and 250 mg/kg/day , p.o. ) was administrated 10 days before 3-NP injection ( pre-administration ) , from the same time with 3-NP injection ( co-administration ) , or from the peak point of neurological impairment by 3-NP injection ( post-administration ) . Pre-administration of KRGE produced the greatest neuroprotective effect in this model . Pre-administration of KRGE significantly decreased 3-NP-induced neurological impairment , lethality , lesion area , and neuronal loss in the 3-NP-injected striatum . KRGE attenuated microglial activation and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) and nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) signal pathway . KRGE also reduced the level of mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin- ( IL- ) 1β , P05231 , inducible nitric oxide synthase , and OX-42 . Interestingly , the intrathecal administration of SB203580 ( a p38 inhibitor ) or PD98059 ( an inhibitor of MAPK Kinase , MEK ) increased the survival rate in the 3-NP-induced HD model . Pre-administration of KRGE may effectively inhibit 3-NP-induced striatal toxicity via the inhibition of the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κB pathways , indicating its therapeutic potential for suppressing Huntington's-like symptoms .
