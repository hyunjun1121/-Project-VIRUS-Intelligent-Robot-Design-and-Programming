Clinical drug-drug interaction assessment of ivacaftor as a potential inhibitor of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein . DB08820 is approved in the USA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis ( CF ) in patients with a G551D- P13569 mutation or one of eight other P13569 mutations . A series of in vitro experiments conducted early in the development of ivacaftor indicated ivacaftor and metabolites may have the potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C8 , P11712 , CYP3A , and P10635 , as well as P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) . Based on these results , a series of clinical drug-drug interaction ( DB00900 ) studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on sensitive substrates of P10632 ( rosiglitazone ) , CYP3A ( midazolam ) , P10635 ( desipramine ) , and P-gp ( digoxin ) . In addition , a DB00900 study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on a combined oral contraceptive , as this is considered an important comedication in CF patients . The results indicate ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp , but has no effect on P10632 or P10635 . DB08820 caused non-clinically significant increases in ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone exposure . Based on these results , caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when concomitant substrates of P11712 , CYP3A and/or P-gp are used during treatment with ivacaftor , particularly drugs with a narrow therapeutic index , such as warfarin .
