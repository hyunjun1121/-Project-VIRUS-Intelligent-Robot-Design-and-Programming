Redistribution of membrane glycoproteins in platelets activated under flow conditions . A reduction in the ability of GPIb to bind specific MoAbs or ligands ( P04275 ) has been reported in platelets exposed to thrombin in suspension . We have analyzed modifications in the presence of glycoproteins ( GPs ) on platelets activated under flow conditions in a system which allows limited thrombin and fibrin generation . Normal blood anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH , DB06779 20 IU/ml ) was recirculated for up to 10 min at 800 s-1 through annular chambers containing denuded arterial segments . Aliquots of blood were removed from the reservoir at 0 , 1 , 5 and 10 min and immediately mixed with paraformaldehyde . Membrane glycoproteins : GPIb ( CD42b ) , P08514 -IIIa ( CD41a ) , P16671 ( P16671 ) ; and activation dependent antigens : P16109 ( CD62P ) and lysosomal glycoprortein ( P08962 ) , were detected in whole blood by dual color flow cytometry . Circulation of through the perfusion system resulted in platelet activated as demonstrated by the increased percentage of platelets positive for antigens CD62P and P08962 . A gradual increase in the binding of MoAbs directed against GPIb , P08514 -IIIa , and P16671 epitopes was noted during the entire perfusion period . Observed differences in mean fluorescence intensities at all the observation times were statistically significant ( P < 0.001 ) . Our results obtained on platelets in an experimental thrombosis system indicate that GPIb , P08514 -IIIa and P16671 remain on the surface of activated platelets and actually increase their expression . Alterations detected at the level of GPIb in platelets activated by thrombin in suspension may not take place under in vivo situations .
