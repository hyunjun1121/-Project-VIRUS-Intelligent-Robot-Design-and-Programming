Antitumor efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) antibody siltuximab in mouse xenograft models of lung cancer . INTRODUCTION : P05231 ( P05231 ) can activate downstream signaling pathways in lung cancer cells , such as the P40763 pathway , and is reported to be produced by tumor cells with activating P00533 mutations . We examined P05231 / P40763 in lung cancer tumor tissues and the effects of siltuximab , a neutralizing antibody to human P05231 , in mouse models of lung cancer . METHODS : P05231 and P40763 activation levels were compared with tumor histology and presence of P01116 mutations in snap-frozen , non-small-cell lung cancer tumors . The effects of siltuximab alone or in combination with erlotinib were examined in mouse xenograft models constructed using three cell line xenograft models and one primary explant mouse model . We examined the influence of cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) on tumor growth and siltuximab effects . RESULTS : P05231 levels were higher in tumors of squamous cell versus adenocarcinoma histology and were not associated with presence of P01116 mutations . Tyrosine phosphorylation status of P40763 did not correlate with tumor P05231 levels . DB00133 phosphorylation of P40763 was correlated with P01116 mutation status . Both tumor and stromal cells contributed to total P05231 within tumors . DB09036 had minimal effect as a single agent in xenografts with tumor cells alone ; however , in models coadministered with CAFs , siltuximab had more potent effects on tumor inhibition . We observed no effects of combined erlotinib and siltuximab . CONCLUSIONS : P05231 is elevated in subsets of human NSCLCs , especially with squamous cell histology . Tumors supported by stromal production of P05231 seem to be the most vulnerable to tumor growth inhibition by siltuximab .
