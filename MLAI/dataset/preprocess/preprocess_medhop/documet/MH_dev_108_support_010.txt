The use of biologic therapies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . The use of biologic agents has revolutionized the management of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in the past two decades . These biologic agents directly target molecules and cells involved in the pathogenesis of RA . Biologic agents indeed lead to a better prognosis and clinical remission in patients with RA , especially in patients who are not well-controlled with traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) . Currently , five P01375 inhibitors ( infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , DB06674 and certolizumab pegol ) , an P05231 receptor antagonist ( tocilizumab ) , an IL-1 receptor antagonist ( anakinra ) , a B cell depleting agent ( rituximab ) and a T cell co-stimulation inhibitor ( abatacept ) have been approved for the treatment of RA . With the increased understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of RA and advantages in manufacturing biotechnology of pharmaceutical companies , a series of novel biologic therapeutic approaches are being developed . In the present paper , we will summarize the biologic agents currently available to treat RA , and the prospective biologic therapies that might be used in the management of RA in future .
