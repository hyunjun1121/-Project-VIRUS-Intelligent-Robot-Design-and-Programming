DB00139 dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- involvement of the mitochondrial DB03147 transporter , Flx1p . The mitochondrial DB03147 transporter , Flx1p , is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family responsible for DB03147 transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It has also been suggested that it has a role in maintaining the normal activity of mitochondrial DB03147 -binding enzymes , including lipoamide dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit Sdh1p . A decrease in the amount of Sdh1p in the flx1Delta mutant strain has been determined here to be due to a post-transcriptional control that involves regulatory sequences located upstream of the P21912 coding sequence . The P21912 coding sequence and the regulatory sequences located downstream of the P21912 coding region , as well as protein import and cofactor attachment , seem to be not involved in the decrease in the amount of protein .
