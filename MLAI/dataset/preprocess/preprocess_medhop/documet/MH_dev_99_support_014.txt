Dose-dependent modulation of apoptotic processes by fluoxetine in maturing neuronal cells : an in vitro study . OBJECTIVES : Recent studies indicate that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) fluoxetine is not solely effective by the instant inhibition of the serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) but also by its influence on mitotic and/or apoptotic processes . METHODS : To investigate the effects of the compound in vitro , we treated neurons from different brain areas with increasing concentrations of fluoxetine . Additionally , human embryonic kidney ( P29320 -293 ) cells and P29320 -293 cells stably expressing the P31645 were used . Cell viability was quantified by MTT-assay and apoptosis via fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analyses . DB00472 's effect on the γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptor was electrophysiologically investigated to test the hypothesis if a GABA-mimetic effect exists that might lead - additionally to the well-known N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) -antagonism - to increased apoptosis in immature neurons . RESULTS : In hippocampal , cortical , and both types of P29320 -293 cells , viability decreased and apoptosis increased in a dose-dependent manner ( 0.5-75 μM ) . In contrast , in mesencephalic and striatal cells the viability was unchanged or even slightly stimulated up to 20 μM fluoxetine . An anti-apoptotic effect of concentrations below 10 μM was observed in these cells . The GABA(A) receptor was directly activated by fluoxetine . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that fluoxetine affects apoptotic processes independently from P31645 expression . Since especially the combined GABA-mimetic and DB01221 -antagonistic effects increase apoptosis in developing neuronal cells , whereas both effects are neuroprotective in adult neurons we hypothesise that these mechanisms explain the discrepancy of in vitro and in vivo studies .
