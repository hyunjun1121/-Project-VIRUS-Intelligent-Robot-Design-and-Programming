Safety of etoricoxib , a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor , in patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced urticaria and angioedema . BACKGROUND : The use of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) has been shown to be safe in patients with aspirin-induced asthma . However , a few individuals with cutaneous reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) experience urticaria or angioedema when challenged with various coxibs . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the clinical tolerance of NSAID-sensitive individuals to the selective P35354 inhibitors etoricoxib and celecoxib . METHODS : Patients with NSAID-induced urticaria or angioedema were challenged in a double-masked , placebo-controlled design protocol with etoricoxib ( 120 mg ) and celecoxib ( 200 mg ) . Cutaneous , respiratory , and general symptoms ; vital signs ; and pulmonary function were monitored hourly for 3 hours . RESULTS : Fifty-eight patients ( 46 females and 12 males ) with a mean +/- SD age of 31.7 +/- 14.1 years ( range , 13-66 years ) who showed urticaria or angioedema when challenged with NSAIDs were included in this study . A cutaneous clinical pattern was observed in 34 patients ( 59 % ) , and a mixed pattern ( cutaneous and respiratory ) was seen in 24 ( 41 % ) . Celecoxib provocation of 54 patients induced urticaria in 3 , urticaria and angioedema in 2 , and urticaria , rhinorrhea , and conjunctival erythema in 1 ( reaction rate , 11.1 % ) . DB01628 challenges performed in 56 patients induced urticaria in 3 and angioedema in 1 ( reaction rate , 7.1 % ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results confirm that most NSAID-sensitive individuals with cutaneous reactions to classic NSAIDs will tolerate specific P35354 inhibitors , supporting the use of thesedrugs after careful oral provocation in such patients .
