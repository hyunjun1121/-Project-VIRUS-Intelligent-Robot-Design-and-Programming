Benzyl isothiocyanate suppresses pancreatic tumor angiogenesis and invasion by inhibiting HIF-α/ P15692 /Rho-GTPases : pivotal role of P35610 -3 . Our previous studies have shown that benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) suppresses pancreatic tumor growth by inhibiting P35610 -3 ; however , the exact mechanism of tumor growth suppression was not clear . Here we evaluated the effects and mechanism of BITC on pancreatic tumor angiogenesis . Our results reveal that BITC significantly inhibits neovasularization on rat aorta and Chicken-Chorioallantoic membrane . Furthermore , BITC blocks the migration and invasion of BxPC-3 and PanC-1 pancreatic cancer cells in a dose dependant manner . Moreover , secretion of P15692 and P08253 in normoxic and hypoxic BxPC-3 and PanC-1 cells was significantly suppressed by BITC . Both P15692 and P08253 play a critical role in angiogenesis and metastasis . Our results reveal that BITC significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of P35968 ( DB00135 -1175 ) , and expression of HIF-α . Rho-GTPases , which are regulated by P15692 play a crucial role in pancreatic cancer progression . BITC treatment reduced the expression of RhoC whereas up-regulated the expression of tumor suppressor RhoB . P35610 -3 over-expression or P05231 treatment significantly induced HIF-1α and P15692 expression ; however , BITC substantially suppressed P35610 -3 as well as P35610 -3-induced HIF-1α and P15692 expression . Finally , in vivo tumor growth and matrigel-plug assay show reduced tumor growth and substantial reduction of hemoglobin content in the matrigel plugs and tumors of mice treated orally with 12 µmol BITC , indicating reduced tumor angiogenesis . Immunoblotting of BITC treated tumors show reduced expression of P35610 -3 phosphorylation ( DB00135 -705 ) , HIF-α , P35968 , P15692 , P08253 , CD31 and RhoC . Taken together , our results suggest that BITC suppresses pancreatic tumor growth by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis through P35610 -3-dependant pathway .
