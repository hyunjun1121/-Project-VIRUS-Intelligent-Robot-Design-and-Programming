Substance P autocrine signaling contributes to persistent P04626 activation that drives malignant progression and drug resistance in breast cancer . P00533 receptor transmodulation by heterologous G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCR ) generates functional diversity in signal transduction . Tachykinins are neuropeptides and proinflammatory cytokines that promote cell survival and cancer progression by activating several GPCRs . In this work , we found that the pain-associated tachykinin Substance P ( SP ) contributes to persistent transmodulation of the P00533 receptors , P00533 and P04626 , in breast cancer , acting to enhance malignancy and therapeutic resistance . SP and its high-affinity receptor P25103 were highly expressed in P04626 (+) primary breast tumors ( relative to the luminal and triple-negative subtypes ) and were overall correlated with poor prognosis factors . In breast cancer cell lines and primary cultures derived from breast cancer samples , we found that SP could activate P04626 . Conversely , RNA interference-mediated attenuation of P25103 , or its chemical inhibition , or suppression of overall GPCR-mediated signaling , all strongly decreased steady-state expression of P00533 and P04626 , establishing that their basal activity relied upon transdirectional activation by GPCR . Thus , SP exposure affected cellular responses to anti- P00533 therapies . Our work reveals an important oncogenic cooperation between P25103 and P04626 , thereby adding a novel link between inflammation and cancer progression that may be targetable by SP antagonists that have been clinically explored .
