DB08827 : A novel agent for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia . PURPOSE : The pharmacology , pharmacokinetics , and clinical efficacy and safety of lomitapide in the management of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) are reviewed . SUMMARY : DB08827 ( Juxtapid , Aegerion Pharmaceuticals ) is an oral microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( P55157 ) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with HoFH , a rare form of hypercholesterolemia that can lead to premature atherosclerotic disease . In clinical trials , the use of lomitapide alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering modalities reduced plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) by a mean of more than 50 % . DB08827 is associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects and increases in hepatic fat levels . DB08827 undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) isoenzyme 3A4 and interacts with P08684 substrates including atorvastatin and simvastatin ; dose adjustment is recommended when lomitapide is used concurrently with these agents . In patients receiving concomitant warfarin , the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) should be closely monitored , as lomitapide use may increase INR values . The recommended initial dosage of lomitapide is 5 mg once daily , with subsequent upward dose adjustment at specified intervals according to tolerability . DB08827 is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe liver disease , patients with sustained abnormal liver function tests , patients taking strong or moderate P08684 inhibitors , and pregnant patients . CONCLUSION : DB08827 is an oral P55157 inhibitor approved for the treatment of HoFH . This agent appears to be a realistic option for patients with HoFH who are unable to attain their LDL-C goal or can not tolerate statin therapy .
