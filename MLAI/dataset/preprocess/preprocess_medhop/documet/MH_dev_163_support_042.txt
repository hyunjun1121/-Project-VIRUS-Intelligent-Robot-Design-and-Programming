Dynamic genetic linkage of intermediate blood pressure phenotypes during postural adaptations in a founder population . Blood pressure ( BP ) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to changing environmental conditions . Standing upright is a recent evolutionary trait , and genetic factors that influence postural adaptations may contribute to BP variability . We studied the effect of posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes . We included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia . Blood pressure , three hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright . The effect of posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was investigated in full pedigrees . Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate genes by sib-pair analyses , and empirical estimates of significance were obtained . A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural effect on linkage . ADRA1A , APO , CAST , Q9Y5Q5 , P34998 , P24530 , P09038 , GC , P17302 , Q92953 , P08254 , P01303 , P08235 , P26678 , P37173 , P25445 , and P34981 showed evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not upon standing , whereas P15121 , P16671 , P25101 , P12259 , P14780 , PKD2 , P27169 , P37231 , Q9UBK2 , P17252 , and P07949 were specifically linked to standing phenotypes . Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each posture . When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a single posture , important genetic components of BP are missed . Supine and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures . Standardized maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP , thus reflecting its dynamic regulation .
