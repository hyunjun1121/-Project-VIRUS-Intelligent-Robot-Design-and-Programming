Levels of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 in paired sera and synovial fluids of juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients : relationship to inflammatory activity , P08254 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 in a longitudinal study . OBJECTIVES : To measure levels of the collagenases matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 and -13 in the synovial fluid ( SF ) and serum of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) , and to correlate these measurements with inflammatory activity , levels of the collagenase activator P08254 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ( P01033 ) . METHODS : Levels of P03956 , -3 , -13 and P01033 were measured in paired SF and serum from 82 JIA patients using enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay and compared between subtypes and patients of different ages and disease durations . These levels were also correlated to the active joint count ( AJC ) and standard measures of inflammatory activity and therapeutic response , including erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( P03372 ) and platelet count ( Q02083 ) . RESULTS : P03956 was detected in JIA SF and correlated with Q02083 . P08254 levels were high in SF and detectable in serum where they correlated with Q02083 , P03372 and AJC . P45452 , however , was not detected in SF or serum . No differences were observed between patients grouped by subtype , age or disease duration . P08254 contributed the majority of total MMP in SF samples resulting in excess MMP levels over P01033 . CONCLUSIONS : P03956 is up-regulated in SF concordant with inflammatory activity in JIA . This was true for patients in all JIA subtypes and age groups , suggesting that the capability for degradation of type II collagen is present in early disease , and throughout the disease course . P08254 may be important in the activation of collagenases and the saturation of exogenous inhibitors . Serum P08254 may therefore be a useful , measurable and specific marker of active disease in JIA .
