Blockade of cannabinoid receptors reduces inflammation , leukocyte accumulation and neovascularization in a model of sponge-induced inflammatory angiogenesis . OBJECTIVE : Angiogenesis depends on a complex interaction between cellular networks and mediators . The endocannabinoid system and its receptors have been shown to play a role in models of inflammation . Here , we investigated whether blockade of cannabinoid receptors may interfere with inflammatory angiogenesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Polyester-polyurethane sponges were implanted in C57Bl/6j mice . Animals received doses ( 3 and 10 mg/kg/daily , s.c. ) of the cannabinoid receptor antagonists SR141716A ( P21554 ) or SR144528 ( CB2 ) . Implants were collected at days 7 and 14 for cytokines , hemoglobin , myeloperoxidase , and N-acetylglucosaminidase measurements , as indices of inflammation , angiogenesis , neutrophil and macrophage accumulation , respectively . Histological and morphometric analysis were also performed . RESULTS : Cannabinoid receptors expression in implants was detected from day 4 after implantation . Treatment with P21554 or CB2 receptor antagonists reduced cellular influx into sponges at days 7 and 14 after implantation , although P21554 receptor antagonist were more effective at blocking leukocyte accumulation . There was a reduction in P01375 -α , P15692 , P09341 /KC , P13500 /JE , and P10147 /MIP-1α levels , with increase in P13501 /RANTES . Both treatments reduced neovascularization . Dual blockade of cannabinoid receptors resulted in maximum inhibition of inflammatory angiogenesis . CONCLUSIONS : Blockade of cannabinoid receptors reduced leukocyte accumulation , inflammation and neovascularization , suggesting an important role of endocannabinoids in sponge-induced inflammatory angiogenesis both via P21554 and CB2 receptors .
