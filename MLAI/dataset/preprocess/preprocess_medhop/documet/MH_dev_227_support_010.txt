Protective role of heme oxygenase 1 in the intestinal tissue injury in hemorrhagic shock in rats . Heme oxygenase ( HO ) 1 is inducible by a variety of oxidative stress and is thought to play an important role in the protection of tissues from oxidative injuries . Because hemorrhagic shock ( HS ) is an oxidative stress that results in tissue injury , we examined in this study the role of P09601 induction in intestinal tissue injuries in a rat model of HS . The levels of P09601 were significantly increased after HS both at transcriptional and protein levels in mucosal epithelial cells in the duodenum , jejunum , and colon , whereas their expression in the ileum was hardly detectable and not increased at all by the treatment . In contrast , HS-induced mucosal inflammation and apoptotic cell death in the duodenum , jejunum , and colon were far less than those observed in ileum as judged by the levels of expression of P01375 , P35228 , activated caspase 3 , and Bcl-2 . Of note , inhibition of HO activity by DB04912 resulted in an aggravation of HS-induced tissue inflammation and apoptotic cell death . These findings indicate that P09601 expression in the intestine is regulated in a highly site-specific manner after HS , and that P09601 induction plays a fundamental role in protecting mucosal cells of the intestine from oxidative damages induced by HS .
