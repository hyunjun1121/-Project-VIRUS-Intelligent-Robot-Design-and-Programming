A dose-ranging study of cabozantinib in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases . BACKGROUND : DB08875 is an oral MET/ P35968 inhibitor . A recent phase II study of cabozantinib ( 100 mg daily ) showed improved bone scans in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , but adverse events ( AE ) caused frequent dose reductions . This study was designed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of cabozantinib at lower starting doses . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : An adaptive design was used to determine the lowest active daily dose among 60 , 40 , and 20 mg . The primary endpoint was week 6 bone scan response , defined as ≥30 % decrease in bone scan lesion area . The secondary endpoint was change in circulating tumor cells ( CTC ) . RESULTS : Among 11 evaluable subjects enrolled at 40 mg , there were 9 partial responses ( PR ) , 1 complete response , and 1 stable disease ( SD ) . Of 10 subjects subsequently enrolled at 20 mg , there were 1 PR , 5 SDs , and 4 with progressive disease . Among 13 subjects enrolled on the 40 mg expansion cohort , there were 6 PRs and 7 SDs . No subjects required dose reduction or treatment interruption at 6 or 12 weeks ; 3 subjects at dose level 0 discontinued due to AEs by 12 weeks . At 40 mg , median treatment duration was 27 weeks . 58 % of subjects with ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL at baseline converted to < 5 . CONCLUSIONS : DB08875 40 mg daily was associated with a high rate of bone scan response . DB08875 40 mg daily was associated with better tolerability than previously reported for cabozantinib 100 mg daily . These observations informed the design of phase III studies of cabozantinib in mCRPC .
