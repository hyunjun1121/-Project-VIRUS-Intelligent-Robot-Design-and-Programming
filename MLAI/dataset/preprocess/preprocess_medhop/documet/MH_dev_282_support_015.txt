Experimental Staphylococcus aureus infection of the mammary gland induces region-specific changes in innate immune gene expression . Staphylococcus aureus is a prolific mastitis-causing bacterium that resides naturally in the environment of the dairy cow . The aim of this study was to profile immune gene expression in tissue from the alveolar , ductal , gland cistern and teat canal regions of the bovine mammary gland following intramammary infection with S. aureus . Quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) was used to profile expression of innate immune genes including pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , cytokines , antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) and acute phase proteins ( APPs ) . Consistent expression of Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) 1-10 and NOD-like receptors ( NODs ) 1-2 was detected in all four tissue regions . Pro-inflammatory cytokines ( P05231 , Q16552 and P10145 ) and anti-inflammatory cytokine ( P22301 ) were induced in all 4 tissues . P05067 ( SAA3 and HP ) and AMP ( DEFB4 and Q8NG35 ) genes showed the greatest induction throughout the mammary gland in response to S. aureus , with particularly high expression in alveolar tissue ( SAA3 and HP > 133- and > 80-fold respectively , P < 0.05 ; DEFB4 and Q8NG35 > 9- and > 27-fold respectively , P < 0.05 ) . Collectively , our data show both sentinel and effector immune functions throughout the mammary gland in response to S. aureus challenge .
