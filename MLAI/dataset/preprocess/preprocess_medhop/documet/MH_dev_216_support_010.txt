Raf inhibitor stabilizes receptor for the type I interferon but inhibits its anti-proliferative effects in human malignant melanoma cells . DB05258 ( IFNalpha ) is widely used in treatment of malignant melanoma patients . This cytokine acts on cells by engaging Type I IFN receptor consisting of two subunits , ( P17181 and P48551 ) followed by activation of Janus kinases ( Jak ) . Levels of P17181 ( regulated via degradation mediated by the betaTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase ) and IFNalpha signaling were reduced in 1205Lu melanoma cell line that harbors activated P15056 and exhibits high levels of betaTrcp ubiquitin ligase . Expression of stabilized P17181 in melanoma cells decreased their tumorigenicity . Furthermore , RNAi-mediated P15056 knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of either Raf or Q02750 decreased levels of betaTrcp and stabilized P17181 . However , despite causing stabilization of P17181 , Raf inhibitor BAY 43-9006 interfered with cellular responses to IFNalpha most likely due to its ability to directly inhibit Jak activity . We discuss the implications of this result for combination therapy with BAY 43-9006 and IFNalpha in melanoma patients .
