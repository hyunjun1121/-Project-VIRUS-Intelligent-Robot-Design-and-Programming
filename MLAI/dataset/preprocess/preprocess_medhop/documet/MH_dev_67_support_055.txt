Signaling and antiproliferative effects of type I and II gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors in breast cancer cells . DB00644 receptors ( DB00644 -Rs ) mediate direct antiproliferative effects on hormone-dependent cancer cells . DB00644 -Rs can be grouped according to ligand specificity ( for DB00644 and -II ) , and there is evidence that type II DB00644 ligands and/or receptors can inhibit proliferation . Type I DB00644 -Rs ( e.g. human and sheep ) lack the C-terminal tails found in other G protein-coupled receptors including type II DB00644 -Rs ( e.g. Xenopus ; XGnRH-R ) . This underlies the remarkable resistance of type I DB00644 -Rs to desensitization and may be important for chronic effects on proliferation . To test this , we have compared the antiproliferative effects of DB00644 -Rs expressed in MCF7 breast cancer cells using recombinant adenovirus ( Ad ) . Endogenous DB00644 -Rs were not detected , but infection with Ad-expressing sheep DB00644 -Rs ( sGnRH-R ) facilitated proliferation inhibition by DB06719 , and maximum inhibition required only 10,000-20,000 sGnRH-Rs . XGnRH-Rs were much less efficient at inhibiting proliferation and were internalized faster than sGnRH-Rs . Thus , the type II P30968 is less efficient at inhibiting proliferation , presumably because it is rapidly desensitized and/or internalized . Moreover , comparisons of human P30968 , sGnRH-R , and XGnRH-R , as well as chimeric receptors ( type I DB00644 -Rs with C-terminal tails from XGnRH-Rs ) , revealed that C-terminal tail addition increases receptor expression and thereby increases the efficiency with which the vector facilitates the antiproliferative effect .
