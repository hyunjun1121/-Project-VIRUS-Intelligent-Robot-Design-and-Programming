[ Cytoprotective and antiangiogenic effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib on human retinal pigmentepithelium ] . BACKGROUND : Cumulative light exposure is significantly associated with progression of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( P15692 ) is the main target of current antiangiogenic treatment strategies for AMD . Previous reports indicated that sorafenib , an oral multikinase inhibitor , might have beneficial effects on exudative AMD . This study investigates the effects of sorafenib on light-induced overexpression of P15692 and its receptors P17948 and 2 in human retinal pigment epithelial ( Q96AT9 ) cells . METHODS : The effects of sorafenib on P17948 and 2 expression of primary human Q96AT9 cells was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , immunohistochemistry and western blotting . In addition , Q96AT9 cells were exposed to white light and incubated with sorafenib . Viability , expression of P15692 and its mRNA were determined by RT-PCR , immunohistochemistry , western blotting , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . RESULTS : DB00398 reduced P17948 and 2 expression of Q96AT9 cells . Light exposure decreased cell viability and increased expression and secretion of P15692 . These light-induced effects were significantly reduced when cells were treated with sorafenib at a dose of 1 Âµg/ml . CONCLUSION : The results show that sorafenib has promising properties as a potential antiangiogenic treatment for AMD .
