Cytoskeletal changes during epithelial-to-fibroblastoid conversion as a crucial mechanism of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin production in hepatocellular carcinoma . Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin ( P12821 ) is a well-established tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , but the precise mechanism by which HCC cells produce P12821 remains unknown . Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that HepG2 cells with chemical induction of epithelial-to-fibroblastoid conversion ( EFC ) produced P12821 through impairment of vitamin K uptake via cytoskeletal rearrangement . Therefore , in this study we further examined this mechanism in vitro and using human HCC samples . Hepatoma cell lines ( HepG2 and P98160 /PRF/5 ) were induced EFC or epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) by phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate ( TPA ) or transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -beta1 . We analyzed these cells by ELISA , Western blotting and immunofluorescent studies . We also examined P12821 production and P12830 expression in human surgically resected HCC samples by immunohistochemical studies . Labeled low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) uptake ( as a surrogate for vitamin K ) was significantly impaired in P12821 -producing hepatoma cells following induction of EFC or EMT . Further , filamentous actin , which plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis , was dissociated in P12821 -producing cells . DB02621 , an actin depolymerizer , induced na√Øve hepatoma cells to produce P12821 with impairment of labeled-LDL uptake . In addition , an P12830 neutralizing antibody did not induce P12821 production . Finally , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that P12821 production was inversely correlated with the intensity of P12830 expression in human HCC cells . In conclusion , cytoskeletal changes during EFC or EMT plays a critical mechanistic role in P12821 production via impairments in vitamin K uptake .
