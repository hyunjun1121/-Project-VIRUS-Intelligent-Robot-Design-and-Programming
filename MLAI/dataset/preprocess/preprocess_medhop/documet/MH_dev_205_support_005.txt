Treatment with arimoclomol , a coinducer of heat shock proteins , delays disease progression in P35858 mice . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition in which motoneurons of the spinal cord and motor cortex die , resulting in progressive paralysis . This condition has no cure and results in eventual death , usually within 1-5 years of diagnosis . Although the specific etiology of P35858 is unknown , 20 % of familial cases of the disease carry mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 ( P00441 ) . Transgenic mice overexpressing human mutant P00441 have a phenotype and pathology that are very similar to that seen in human P35858 patients . Here we show that treatment with arimoclomol , a coinducer of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , significantly delays disease progression in mice expressing a P00441 mutant in which glycine is substituted with alanine at position 93 ( P00441 (G93A) ) . DB05025 -treated P00441 (G93A) mice show marked improvement in hind limb muscle function and motoneuron survival in the later stages of the disease , resulting in a 22 % increase in lifespan . Pharmacological activation of the heat shock response may therefore be a successful therapeutic approach to treating P35858 , and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases .
