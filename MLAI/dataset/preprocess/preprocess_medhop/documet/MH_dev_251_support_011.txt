Inhibition of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 by the phospholipase-blocker , arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone ( Q06187 ) is widely used as an inhibitor of cytosolic group IV phospholipase A(2) ( cPLA(2) ) and calcium-independent group VI phospholipase A(2) ( iPLA(2) ) . Q06187 thus reduces arachidonic acid ( AA ) substrate for cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ; also known as prostaglandin H synthase ) and attenuates prostaglandin ( PG ) synthesis . It has been shown previously , that Q06187 blocks thromboxane B(2) production induced by exogenous AA in human platelets . It remains , however , unknown whether Q06187 also directly modulates the activity of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Time courses for inhibition of P36551 by Q06187 was obtained using osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells , with exogenous AA as substrate and the pure enzymes P23219 and P35354 . PGE(2) was measured by GC-MS . KEY RESULTS : Q06187 was a potent inhibitor of P23219 and P35354 with IC(50) values of 0.5 and 0.1 microM in MC3T3-E1 cells and of 1.7 and 2.6 microM using the pure enzymes . Inhibition was reversible , with slow- and tight-binding characteristics . The arachidonyl carbon chain was essential , as the saturated palmitoyl analogue had no effect . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : Attenuation of PG synthesis by Q06187 is taken to be the consequence of PLA(2) inhibition and the findings of many studies are interpreted on that basis . If there are , however , alternative routes for AA liberation ( such as phospholipase C/diacyl glycerol lipase or phospholipase D ) , this interpretation can lead to false conclusions . As Q06187 is a widely used and important pharmacological tool in eicosanoid research , knowledge of its interactions with other major enzymes of the cascade is of considerable importance .
