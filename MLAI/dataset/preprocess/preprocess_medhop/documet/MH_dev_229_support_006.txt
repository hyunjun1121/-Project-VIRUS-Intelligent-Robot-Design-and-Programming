Biological characterization of DB05037 , a small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases , in human tumor cell lines . P12004 -dependent kinases ( CDK ) , and their regulatory cyclin partners , play a central role in eukaryotic cell growth , division , and death . This key role in cell cycle progression , as well as their deregulation in several human cancers , makes them attractive therapeutic targets in oncology . A series of CDK inhibitors was developed using Astex 's fragment-based medicinal chemistry approach , linked to high-throughput X-ray crystallography . A compound from this series , designated DB05037 , is currently in early-phase clinical development . We describe here the biological characterization of DB05037 , a potent inhibitor of several CDK family members . DB05037 showed potent antiproliferative activity ( 40-940 nmol/L ) in a panel of human tumor cell lines , and the mechanism of action was shown here to be consistent with the inhibition of P06493 and P24941 in solid tumor cell lines . DB05037 caused cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in human tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in human tumor xenograft models . Tumor regression was observed following twice daily dosing of DB05037 in the HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer xenograft models . We show that these biological effects are linked to inhibition of CDKs in vivo and that DB05037 induces tumor cell apoptosis in these xenograft models . DB05037 has an attractive biological profile for development as a clinical candidate , and the tolerability and efficacy in animal models compare favorably with other CDK inhibitors in clinical development . Studies described here formed the biological rationale for investigating the potential therapeutic benefit of DB05037 in cancer patients .
