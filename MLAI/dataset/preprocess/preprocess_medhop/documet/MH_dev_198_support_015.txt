[ Cell cycle analysis of endometrial cancer cells in vitro treated with growth factor and steroid hormone ] . The aim of this study was to overtake the mechanism of the control system in endometrial cancer cell line in vitro . Ishikawa cell ( IK cell ) and O14777 -1 cell ( O14777 cell ) derived from endometrial cancers were cultured with serum free medium ( SFM-101 ) . IK cell possessed P03372 ( ER ) , P06401 ( PR ) , Epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) and its receptor ( P00533 ) . O14777 cell had PR , P01133 , and P00533 , however O14777 cell did not keep ER . P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell , but the growth of O14777 cell was not stimulated by P01133 . S phase cells were increased by P01133 in IK cell , but were not increased by P01133 in O14777 cell . The growth of IK cell was stimulated significantly by P01133 and Estradiol-17 beta ( E2 ) + P01133 than control . However , E2+ P01133 did not stimulate the growth of IK cell than P01133 significantly . DB01406 ( D ) and D+ P01133 inhibited the growth of IK cell significantly than control . S phase cells were decreased by the treatment of D and D+ P01133 . From our results , P01133 stimulated the growth of ER positive endometrial cancer cell , but P01133 did not stimulate ER negative endometrial cancer cell . E2+ P01133 and P01133 stimulated the growth of IK cell as a same . However , D inhibited the growth of IK cell that was stimulated by P01133 .
