Investigation of interaction of human platelet membrane components with anticoagulant drugs DB00054 and DB00063 . DB00054 ( Abci ) and eptifibatide ( Epti ) are antiaggregate drugs which may reduce thrombotic complications in acute coronary syndromes . The aim of this work was the investigation of the interaction between the phospholipid- P08514 /IIIa glycoprotein complex and Abci or Epti , and the influence of these drugs on the phospholipid ratio in the platelet membrane . The interaction between the phospholipid- P08514 /IIIa glycoprotein complex and antiaggregate drugs were investigated using the Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging technique ( SPRI ) . Phospholipids phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and sphingomyelin ( SM ) were first immobilized onto the gold chip surface . The phospholipid ratio in the platelet membrane was determined by the HPLC . Only PI , PS , PE and PC were determined . Human platelets treated ' in vitro ' with Abci or Epti exhibit changes in the phospholipid ratio in the platelet membrane . The ratio of PS decreases and PC rises . The SPRI distinctly shows interactions between phospholipids and glycoprotein P08514 /IIIa , and between the phospholipid-glycoprotein P08514 /IIIa complex and Abci or Epti . The interaction between phospholipids and glycoprotein P08514 /IIIa is growing in the sequence : PI << SM < PE < PC < PS . The interaction between phospholipid-glycoprotein P08514 /IIIa complex and Abci/Epti is growing in the sequence : PS < PI < PC < PE < SM . SPRI was proved to be excellent tool for observation of such interactions .
