Worksite-based behavioral treatment of mild hypertension . Two behaviorally-oriented , nonpharmacological treatments - rational-emotive therapy/assertiveness training ( P07949 /AT ) and anxiety management training ( AMT ) - and one control treatment - hypertension education counseling ( O14777 ) - were compared in reducing blood pressures of 22 white-collar mold hypertensives in a worksite setting . Results showed significant reductions by posttreatment in diastolic pressures of participants in the two behavioral treatment conditions , but no significant differential treatment effect across groups . Systolic pressure reductions by postreatment were significant only in the P07949 /AT training condition . Reductions were generally maintained at an either-week follow-up .
