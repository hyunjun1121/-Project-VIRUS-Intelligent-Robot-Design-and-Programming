Influence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator on gene expression in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of human bronchial epithelial cells . Chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes significant morbidity in cystic fibrosis patients initiated by the failure of innate immune responses . We used microarray analysis and real-time PCR to detect transcriptional changes associated with cytokine production in isogenic bronchial epithelial cell lines with either wild-type ( WT ) or mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) in response to P. aeruginosa infection . The transcription of four NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine genes was maximal in the presence of WT P13569 : the interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) , P05231 , P09341 , and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ( P05362 ) genes . Analysis of protein expression in two cell lines paired for wild-type and mutant P13569 with three P. aeruginosa strains showed P05231 and P10145 expressions were consistently enhanced by the presence of WT P13569 in both cell lines with all three strains of P. aeruginosa , although some strains gave small P10145 increases in cells with mutant P13569 . P09341 production showed consistent enhancement in cells with WT P13569 using all three bacterial strains in one cell line , whereas in the other cell line , P09341 showed a significant increase in cells with either WT or mutant P13569 . P05362 was unchanged at the protein level in one of the cell lines but did show mild enhancement with WT P13569 in the other cell pair . Inhibitions of NF-kappaB prior to infection indicated differing degrees of dependence on NF-kappaB for production of the cytokines , contingent on the cell line . Cytokine effectors of innate immunity to P. aeruginosa were found to be positively influenced by the presence of WT P13569 , indicating a role in resistance to P. aeruginosa infection .
