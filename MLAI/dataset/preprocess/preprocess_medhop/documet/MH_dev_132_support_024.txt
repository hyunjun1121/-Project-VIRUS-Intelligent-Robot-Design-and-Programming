Inhibition of central angiotensin converting enzyme ameliorates scopolamine induced memory impairment in mice : role of cholinergic neurotransmission , cerebral blood flow and brain energy metabolism . Evidences indicate that inhibition of central P00797 angiotensin system ( DB01367 ) ameliorates memory impairment in animals and humans . Earlier we have reported involvement of central angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 ) in streptozotocin induced neurodegeneration and memory impairment . The present study investigated the role of central P12821 in cholinergic neurotransmission , brain energy metabolism and cerebral blood flow ( Q03701 ) in model of memory impairment induced by injection of scopolamine in mice . DB00790 ( 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg , PO ) was given orally for one week before administration of scopolamine ( 3mg/kg , IP ) . Then , memory function was evaluated by Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests . Q03701 was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry . Biochemical and molecular parameters were estimated after the completion of behavioral studies . DB00747 caused impairment in memory which was associated with reduced Q03701 , acetylcholine ( ACh ) level and elevated acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) activity and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level . DB00790 ameliorated scopolamine induced amnesia in both the behavioral paradigms . Further , perindopril prevented elevation of P22303 and MDA level in mice brain . There was a significant increase in Q03701 and ACh level in perindopril treated mice . However , scopolamine had no significant effect on DB00171 level and mRNA expression of angiotensin receptors and P12821 in cortex and hippocampus . But , perindopril significantly decreased P12821 activity in brain without affecting its mRNA expression . The study clearly showed the interaction between P12821 and cholinergic neurotransmission and beneficial effect of perindopril can be attributed to improvement in central cholinergic neurotransmission and Q03701 .
