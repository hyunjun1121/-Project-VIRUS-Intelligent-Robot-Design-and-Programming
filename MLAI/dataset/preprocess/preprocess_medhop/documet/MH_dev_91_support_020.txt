Effect of acetazolamide on aquaporin-1 and fluid flow in cultured choroid plexus . DB00819 ( AZA ) , used in treatment of early or infantile hydrocephalus , is effective in some cases , while its effect on the choroid plexus ( CP ) remains ill-defined . The drug reversibly inhibits aquaporin-4 ( P55087 ) , the most ubiquitous " water pore " in the brain , and perhaps modulation of P29972 ( located apically on CP cells ) by AZA may reduce cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) production . We sought to elucidate the effect of AZA on P29972 and fluid flow in CP cell cultures.CP tissue culture from 10-day Sprague-Dawley rats and a TRCSF-B cell line were grown on Transwell permeable supports and treated with 100 Î¼M AZA . Fluid assays to assess direction and extent of fluid flow , and P29972 expression patterns by immunoblot , Immuncytochemistry ( ICC ) , and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) were performed.Immunoblots and ICC analyses showed a decrease in P29972 protein shortly after AZA treatment ( lowest at 12 h ) , with transient P29972 reduction mediated by mRNA expression ( lowest at 6 h ) . Transwell fluid assays indicated a fluid shift at 2 h , before significant changes in P29972 mRNA or protein levels.Timing of AZA effect on P29972 suggests the drug alters protein transcription , while affecting fluid flow by a concomitant method . It is plausible that other mechanisms account for these phenomena , as the processes may occur independently .
