Immunoaffinity purification of the functional 20S proteasome from human cells via transient overexpression of specific proteasome subunits . The proteasome is a multi-subunit proteolytic complex that plays a central role in protein degradation in all eukaryotic cells . It regulates many vital cellular processes therefore its dysfunction can lead to various pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration . Isolation of enzymatically active proteasomes is a key step to the successful study of the proteasome regulation and functions . Here we describe a simple and efficient protocol for immunoaffinity purification of the functional 20S proteasomes from human P29320 293T cells after transient overexpression of specific proteasome subunits tagged with 3xFLAG . To construct 3xFLAG-fusion proteins , DNA sequences encoding the 20S proteasome subunits P28074 , P28066 , and P25788 were cloned into mammalian expression vector pIRES-hrGFP-1a . The corresponding recombinant proteins P28074 -3xFLAG , P28066 -3xFLAG , or P25788 -3xFLAG were transiently overexpressed in human P29320 293T cells and were shown to be partially incorporated into the intact proteasome complexes . 20S proteasomes were immunoprecipitated from P29320 293T cell extracts under mild conditions using antibodies against FLAG peptide . Isolation of highly purified 20S proteasomes were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against different proteasome subunits . Affinity purified 20S proteasomes were shown to possess chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like peptidase activities confirming their functionality . This simple single-step affinity method of the 20S proteasome purification can be instrumental to subsequent functional studies of proteasomes in human cells .
