Effects of dutasteride on the expression of genes related to androgen metabolism and related pathway in human prostate cancer cell lines . Androgens play an important role in controlling the growth of the normal prostate gland and in the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia , and prostate cancer . Although testosterone is the main androgen secreted from the testes , dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) , a more potent androgen converted from testosterone by 5alpha-reductase isozymes , type I and II , is the major androgen in the prostate cells . The aim of this study is to investigate the cellular and molecular effects of dutasteride , a potent inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase type I and type II , in androgen-responsive ( LNCaP ) and androgen-unresponsive ( DU145 ) human prostate cancer(PCa) cell lines . The expression pattern of 190 genes , selected on the basis of their proved or potential role in prostate cancerogenesis related to androgen signalling , were analysed using a low density home-made oligoarray ( AndroChip 2 ) . Our results show that dutasteride reduces cell viability and cell proliferation in both cell lines tested . AndroChip 2 gene signature identified in LNCaP a total of 11 genes differentially expressed ( FC > or= +/-1.5 ) . Eight of these genes , were overexpressed and three were underexpressed . Overexpressed genes included genes encoding for proteins involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of androgen ( P14061 ; P37058 ; P19099 ) , androgen receptor and androgen receptor co-regulators ( AR; P24385 ) , and signal transduction ( P04626 ; V- P62158 ; Q07889 ) whereas , underexpressed genes ( KLK3 ; P20151 ; Q15392 ) were androgen-regulated genes ( ARGs ) . No differentially expressed genes were scored in DU145 . Microarray data were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assay ( QRT-PCR ) . These data offer a selective genomic signature for dutasteride treatment in prostate epithelial cells and provide important insights in prostate cancer pathophysiology .
