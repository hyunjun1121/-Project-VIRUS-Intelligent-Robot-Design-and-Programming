Helicobacter pylori-induced interleukin-12 p40 expression . Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells that promotes the development of T-helper lymphocyte 1 ( Th1 ) . Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori is considered a Th1-mediated process . IL-12 levels in gastric biopsy samples of H. pylori-infected patients are higher than in those of uninfected individuals , but the cellular source of IL-12 remains elusive . IL-12 staining was detected in mucosal epithelial cells , lymphocytes , and macrophages in specimens of patients with H. pylori-positive gastritis . Therefore , we investigated IL-12 p40 mRNA induction by H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells and T cells . Although cag pathogenicity island ( P05121 ) -positive H. pylori induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression , an isogenic mutant of the cag P05121 failed to induce it in both cell types . Supernatants from H. pylori cultures and H. pylori VacA induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression in T cells but not in epithelial cells . The activation of the IL-12 p40 promoter by H. pylori was mediated through NF-kappaB . The transfection of O15111 and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase dominant-negative mutants inhibited H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 activation . Inhibitors of NF-kappaB , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and Hsp90 suppressed H. pylori- and VacA-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression . The results indicate that H. pylori induces IL-12 p40 expression by the activation of NF-kappaB , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase . Hsp90 is also a crucial regulator of H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 expression . In addition to the cag P05121 , VacA might be relevant in the induction of IL-12 expression and a Th1-polarized response only in T cells .
