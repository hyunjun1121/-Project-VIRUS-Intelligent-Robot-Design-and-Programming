Antiproliferative effect of DB00035 analogs on human breast cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Desmopressin ( dDAVP ) , a synthetic nonapeptide derivative of arginine vasopressin , is a safe antidiuretic and hemostatic compound that acts as a selective agonist for the vasopressin V2 membrane receptor ( P30518 ) . It is known that dDAVP can inhibit progression of residual metastatic cells in preclinical models . Among other mechanisms , the compound induces an agonist effect on P30518 present in tumor cells . RESULTS/DISCUSSION : Looking for novel analogs with improved anti-tumor activity , positions 4 and 5 , at the conformational peptide loop , were substituted . The analog [V(4)Q(5)]dDAVP ( [ 4-valine 5-glutamine ] desmopressin ) exhibited a significantly higher antiproliferative effect than dDAVP in cultures of MCF-7 , a P30518 -expressing human breast carcinoma cell line . The chiral isomer of this analog and tetrapeptide fragments corresponding to the loop region were also assessed . CONCLUSION : Preclinical evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of [V(4)Q(5)]dDAVP in animal models is warranted .
