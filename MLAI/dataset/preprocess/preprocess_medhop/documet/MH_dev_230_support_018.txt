Attenuation of anti-tuberculosis therapy induced hepatotoxicity by Spirulina fusiformis , a candidate food supplement . Therapy using Isoniazid ( DB00951 ) and DB01045 ( Q9HBH0 ) leads to induction of hepatotoxicity in some individuals undergoing anti-tuberculosis treatment . In this study , we assessed the effect of Spirulina fusiformis on DB00951 and Q9HBH0 induced hepatotoxicity in rats compared with hepatoprotective drug Silymarin . Induction of hepatotoxicity was measured by changes in the liver marker enzymes ( aspartate transaminase , alanine transaminase , and alkaline phosphatase ) . The antioxidant status was also analyzed in liver tissue homogenate and plasma by measurement of superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione-S-transferase , glutathione reductase , and lipid peroxidation levels . We also aimed to study the binding and interactions of the transcription factors Pregnane X Receptor ( O75469 ) and Farnesoid X Receptor ( Q96RI1 ) with DB00951 , Q9HBH0 , and representative active compounds of Spirulina fusiformis by in silico methods . The administration of DB00951 and Q9HBH0 resulted in significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in the antioxidant levels and total protein levels . There was also a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in the levels of liver marker enzymes . Spirulina fusiformis was seen to protect the parameters from significant changes upon challenge with DB00951 and Q9HBH0 in a dose-dependent manner . This was corroborated by histological examination of the liver . The results of the in silico analyses further support the wet lab results .
