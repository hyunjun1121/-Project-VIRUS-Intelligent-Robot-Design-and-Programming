13C nuclear magnetic resonance detection of interactions of serine hydroxymethyltransferase with C1- DB00116 synthase and glycine decarboxylase complex activities in Arabidopsis . In P01024 plants , serine synthesis is associated with photorespiratory glycine metabolism involving the DB00116 ( DB00116 ) -dependent activities of the glycine decarboxylase complex ( P16260 ) and serine hydroxymethyl transferase ( SHMT ) . Alternatively , DB00116 -dependent serine synthesis can occur via the P11586 /SHMT pathway . We used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to examine serine biosynthesis by these two pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana ( L. ) Heynh . Columbia wild type . We confirmed the tight coupling of the P16260 / SHMT system and observed directly in a higher plant the flux of formate through the P11586 /SHMT system . The accumulation of 13C-enriched serine over 24 h from the P16260 /SHMT activities was 4-fold greater than that from P11586 /SHMT activities . Our experiments strongly suggest that the two pathways operate independently in Arabidopsis . Plants exposed to methotrexate and sulfanilamide , powerful inhibitors of DB00116 biosynthesis , reduced serine synthesis by both pathways . The results suggest that continuous supply of DB00116 is essential to maintain high rates of serine metabolism . Nuclear magnetic resonance is a powerful tool for the examination of DB00116 -mediated metabolism in its natural cellular environment .
