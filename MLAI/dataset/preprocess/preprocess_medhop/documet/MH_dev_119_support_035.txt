DB06779 , a low-molecular-weight heparin , promotes angiogenesis mediated by heparin-binding P15692 in vivo . Tumors are angiogenesis dependent and vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( P15692 ) , a heparin-binding protein , is a key angiogenic factor . As chemotherapy and co-treatment with anticoagulant low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) are common in cancer patients , we investigated whether angiogenesis in vivo mediated by P15692 is modulated by metronomic-type treatment with : ( i ) the LMWH dalteparin ; ( ii ) low-dosage cytostatic epirubicin ; or ( iii ) a combination of these two drugs . Using the quantitative rat mesentery angiogenesis assay , in which angiogenesis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of very low doses of P15692 , dalteparin sodium ( Fragmin(®) ) and epirubicin ( Farmorubicin(®) ) were administered separately or in combination by continuous subcutaneous infusion at a constant rate for 14 consecutive days . DB06779 was administered at 27 , 80 , or 240 IU/kg/day , i.e. , doses that reflect the clinical usage of this drug , while epirubicin was given at the well-tolerated dosage of 0.4 mg/kg/day . While dalteparin significantly stimulated angiogenesis in an inversely dose-dependent manner , epirubicin did not significantly affect angiogenesis . However , concurrent treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis . The effect of dalteparin is the first demonstration of a proangiogenic effect of any LMWH in vivo . The fact that co-treatment with dalteparin and epirubicin significantly inhibited angiogenesis suggests a complex drug effect .
