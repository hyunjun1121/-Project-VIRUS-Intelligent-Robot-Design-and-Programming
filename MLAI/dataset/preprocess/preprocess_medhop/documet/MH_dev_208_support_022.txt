P06401 -mediated up-regulation of transthyretin in preimplantation mouse uterus . P02766 ( P02766 ) , a carrier for thyroxine and retinol , has its messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expressed in the glandular endometrial epithelium and its protein detected in the glandular endometrial epithelium and the uterine lumen . P02766 mRNA is dramatically up-regulated in the preimplantation mouse uterus as well as the P-treated ovariectomized mouse uterus , and in both situations the up-regulation of P02766 is blocked by treatment with the P receptor antagonist DB00834 .
