Targeted disruption of the methionine synthase gene in mice . Alterations in homocysteine , methionine , folate , and/or B12 homeostasis have been associated with neural tube defects , cardiovascular disease , and cancer . Q99707 , one of only two mammalian enzymes known to require vitamin B12 as a cofactor , lies at the intersection of these metabolic pathways . This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyl- DB00116 to homocysteine , generating DB00116 and methionine . Human patients with methionine synthase deficiency exhibit homocysteinemia , homocysteinuria , and hypomethioninemia . They suffer from megaloblastic anemia with or without some degree of neural dysfunction and mental retardation . To better study the pathophysiology of methionine synthase deficiency , we utilized gene-targeting technology to inactivate the methionine synthase gene in mice . On average , heterozygous knockout mice from an outbred background have slightly elevated plasma homocysteine and methionine compared to wild-type mice but seem to be otherwise indistinguishable . Homozygous knockout embryos survive through implantation but die soon thereafter . Nutritional supplementation during pregnancy was unable to rescue embryos that were completely deficient in methionine synthase . Whether any human patients with methionine synthase deficiency have a complete absence of enzyme activity is unclear . These results demonstrate the importance of this enzyme for early development in mice and suggest either that methionine synthase-deficient patients have residual methionine synthase activity or that humans have a compensatory mechanism that is absent in mice .
