Genetic markers associated with abstinence length in alcohol-dependent subjects treated with acamprosate . DB00659 supports abstinence in some alcohol-dependent subjects , yet predictors of response are unknown . To identify response biomarkers , we investigated associations of abstinence length with polymorphisms in candidate genes in glycine and glutamate neurotransmission pathways and genes previously implicated in acamprosate response . Association analyses were conducted in the discovery sample of 225 alcohol-dependent subjects treated with acamprosate for 3 months in community-based treatment programs in the United States . Data from 110 alcohol-dependent males treated with acamprosate in the study PREDICT were used for replication of the top association findings . Statistical models were adjusted for relevant covariates , including recruitment site and baseline clinical variables associated with response . In the discovery sample , shorter abstinence was associated with increased intensity of alcohol craving and lower number of days between the last drink and initiation of acamprosate treatment . After adjustment for covariates , length of abstinence was associated with the Q13224 rs2058878 ( P=4.6 Ã— 10(-5) ) . In the replication sample , shorter abstinence was associated with increased craving , increased depressive mood score and higher alcohol consumption . Association of abstinence length with Q13224 rs2058878 was marginally significant ( P=0.0675 ) ; as in the discovery sample , the minor A allele was associated with longer abstinence . Furthermore , rs2300272 , which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2058878 , was also associated with abstinence length ( P=0.049 ) . This is the first report of a replicated association of genetic markers with the length of abstinence in acamprosate-treated alcoholics . Investigation of the underlying mechanisms of this association and its usefulness for individualized treatment selection should follow .
