Activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway in vascular smooth muscle by serotonin . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT ) is a vasoconstrictor and mitogen whose levels are elevated in diabetes . Previous studies have shown the presence of 5- Q13049 , P41595 , and P28222 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . There are currently no data regarding P41595 and P28222 receptor activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway in VSMCs and resultant potential alterations in 5-HT signaling in diabetes . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT differentially activates the JAK/ P35610 pathway in VSMCs under conditions of normal ( 5 mM ) and high ( 25 mM ) glucose . Treatment of rat VSMCs with 5-HT ( 10(-6) M ) resulted in time-dependent activation ( approximately 2-fold ) of O60674 , P23458 , and P42224 , but not P40763 ( maximal at 5 min , returned to baseline by 30 min ) . The P41595 receptor agonist BW723C86 and the P28222 receptor agonist CGS12066A ( 10(-9)-10(-5) M , 5-min stimulation ) did not activate the JAK/ P35610 pathway . Treatment with the 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist ketanserin ( 10 nM ) inhibited O60674 activation by 5-HT . Treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with ketanserin ( 5 mg.kg-1.day-1 ) reduced activation of O60674 and P42224 but not P40763 in endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta in vivo . 5-HT ( 10(-6) M ) treatment resulted in increased cell proliferation and increased DNA synthesis , which were inhibited by the O60674 inhibitor AG490 . Further studies with apocynin , diphenyleneiodonium chloride , catalase , and virally transfected superoxide dismutase had no effect at either glucose concentration on activation of the JAK/ P35610 pathway by 5-HT . Therefore , we conclude that 5-HT activates O60674 , P23458 , and P42224 via the 5- Q13049 receptors in a reactive oxygen species-independent manner under both normal and high glucose conditions .
