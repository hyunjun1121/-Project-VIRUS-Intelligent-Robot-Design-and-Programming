Inhibition of angiogenic and non-angiogenic targets by sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) in a RCC xenograft model . BACKGROUND : It is widely recognised that sorafenib inhibits a range of molecular targets in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . In this study , we aim to use patient-derived RCC xenografts to delineate the angiogenic and non-angiogenic molecular targets of sorafenib therapy for advanced RCC ( aRCC ) . METHODS : We successfully generated three patient RCC-derived xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice , consisting of three different RCC histological subtypes : conventional clear cell , poorly differentiated clear cell RCC with sarcomatoid changes , and papillary RCC . This study also used clear cell RCC cells ( 786-0/EV ) harbouring mutant P40337 to investigate the clonogenic survival of cells transfected with survivin sense and antisense oligonucleotides . RESULTS : All three xenografts retain their original histological characteristics . We reported that sorafenib inhibited all three RCC xenograft lines regardless of histological subtypes in a dose-dependant manner . DB00398 -induced growth suppression was associated with not only inhibition of angiogenic targets p- P09619 -Î² , p- P35968 , and their downstream signalling pathways p-Akt and p- P29323 , cell cycle , and anti-apoptotic proteins that include cyclin D1 , cyclin B1 , and survivin but also upregulation of proapoptotic Bim . Survivin knockdown by survivin-specific antisense-oligonucleotides inhibited colony formation and induced cell death in clear cell RCC cells . CONCLUSION : This study has shed light on the molecular mechanisms of sorafenib in RCC . Inhibition of non-angiogenic molecules by sorafenib could contribute in part to its anti-tumour activities observed in vivo , in addition to its anti-angiogenic effects .
