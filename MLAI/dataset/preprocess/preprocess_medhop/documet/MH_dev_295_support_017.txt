Rescue from failed growth factor and/or chemotherapy P19526 mobilization with G- P04141 and plerixafor ( DB06809 ) : an institutional experience . Auto- P09683 has been shown to be a potentially curative treatment for a variety of hematological malignancies . Auto- P09683 is dependent on the successful mobilization and collection of hematopoietic stem cells to ensure engraftment . The inability to mobilize sufficient number of hematopoietic stem cells using standard cytokine-assisted mobilization strategies excludes eligible patients from potentially curative auto- P09683 . DB06809 ( DB06809 ; DB06809 ) , a novel bicyclam antagonist of the SDF-1alpha/ P61073 complex , has been reported previously to augment PBSC mobilization in patients undergoing their first planned stem cell mobilization and collection attempt . In our experience , 17 of 20 patients otherwise eligible for auto- P09683 who failed previous mobilization attempts had successful mobilization of P28906 (+) hematopoietic stem cells with one apheresis procedure , and an additional patient required two aphereses procedures , when treated with the combination of plerixafor and G- P04141 on a compassionate use protocol available at our institution .
