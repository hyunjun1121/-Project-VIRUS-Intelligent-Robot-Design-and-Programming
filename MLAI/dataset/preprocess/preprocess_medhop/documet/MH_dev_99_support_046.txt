The Q9Y275 /APRIL system : emerging functions beyond B cell biology and autoimmunity . The Q9Y275 system plays a key role in the development of autoimmunity , especially in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . This often leads to the assumption that Q9Y275 is mostly a B cell factor with a specific role in autoimmunity . Focus on Q9Y275 and autoimmunity , driven by pharmaceutical successes with the recent approval of a novel targeted therapy DB08879 , has relegated other potential roles of Q9Y275 to the background . Far from being SLE-specific , the Q9Y275 system has a much broader relevance in infection , cancer and allergy . In this review , we provide the latest views on additional roles of the Q9Y275 system in health and diseases , as well as an update on Q9Y275 and autoimmunity , with particular focus on current clinical trials .
