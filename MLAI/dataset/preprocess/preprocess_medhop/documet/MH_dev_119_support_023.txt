Functional changes in rheumatoid fibroblast-like synovial cells through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated signalling pathway . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a ligand dependent transcriptional factor known to be a regulator of adipogenesis . Recent studies have also shown that stimulation of PPARgamma inhibits the transcriptional activities of other nuclear factors and down-regulates proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in T cells and monocytes . We examined , in the present study , the functional significance of PPARgamma expressed in fibroblast-like synovial cells ( FLS ) isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Incubation of FLS with a synthetic PPARgamma ligand , troglitazone , inhibited endogenous production of P01375 , P05231 and P10145 , as well as matrix metalloprotease-3 ( P08254 ) , without inducing apoptosis of the cells . The gelatinase activity of FLS culture media was also inhibited by troglitazone . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) showed a significant reduction in the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in troglitazone-treated FLS in response to P01375 or IL-1beta . Moreover , long-term cultivation of FLS with troglitazone resulted in morphological changes with marked lipid accumulation in these cells . Our results show a negative regulatory function for PPARgamma on cytokine and MMP production together with inhibition of cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses in rheumatoid synovial cells . Our results also suggest that FLS could differentiate into adipocyte-like cells in the presence of proper stimulatory signals including PPARgamma .
