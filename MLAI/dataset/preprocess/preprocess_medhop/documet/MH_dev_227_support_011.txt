Androgens induce prostate cancer cell proliferation through mammalian target of rapamycin activation and post-transcriptional increases in cyclin D proteins . P10275 ( AR ) plays a central role in prostate cancer , with most tumors responding to androgen deprivation therapies , but the molecular basis for this androgen dependence has not been determined . Androgen [ 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DB02901 ) ] stimulation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells , which have constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt pathway activation due to P60484 loss , caused increased expression of cyclin D1 , D2 , and D3 proteins , retinoblastoma protein hyperphosphorylation , and cell cycle progression . However , cyclin D1 and D2 message levels were unchanged , indicating that the increases in cyclin D proteins were mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism . This mechanism was identified as mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) activation . DB02901 treatment increased P42345 activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the downstream targets P08133 S6 kinase and Q13541 , and P42345 inhibition with rapamycin blocked the DB02901 -stimulated increase in cyclin D proteins . Significantly , DB02901 stimulation of P42345 was not mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase pathways and subsequent tuberous sclerosis complex 2/tuberin inactivation or by suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase . In contrast , P42345 activation by DB02901 was dependent on AR-stimulated mRNA synthesis . Oligonucleotide microarrays showed that DB02901 -stimulated rapid increases in multiple genes that regulate nutrient availability , including transporters for amino acids and other organic ions . These results indicate that a critical function of AR in P60484 -deficient prostate cancer cells is to support the pathologic activation of P42345 , possibly by increasing the expression of proteins that enhance nutrient availability and thereby prevent feedback inhibition of P42345 .
