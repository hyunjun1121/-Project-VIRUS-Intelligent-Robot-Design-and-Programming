Neurohypophysial receptor gene expression by thymic T cell subsets and thymic T cell lymphoma cell lines . Neurohypophysial oxytocin ( OT ) and vasopressin ( VP ) genes are transcribed in thymic epithelium , while immature T lymphocytes express functional neurohypophysial receptors . Neurohypophysial receptors belong to the G protein-linked seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily and are encoded by four distinct genes , OTR , V1R , P30518 and V3R . The objective of this study was to identify the nature of neurohypophysial receptor in thymic T cell subsets purified by immunomagnetic selection , as well as in murine thymic lymphoma cell lines RL12-NP and BW5147 . OTR is transcribed in all thymic T cell subsets and T cell lines , while V3R transcription is restricted to P01730 +CD8+ and CD8+ thymic cells . Neither V1R nor P30518 transcripts are detected in any kind of T cells . The OTR protein was identified by immunocytochemistry on thymocytes freshly isolated from C57BL/6 mice . In murine fetal thymic organ cultures , a specific OTR antagonist does not modify the percentage of T cell subsets , but increases late T cell apoptosis further evidencing the involvement of OT/OTR signaling in the control of T cell proliferation and survival . According to these data , OTR and V3R are differentially expressed during T cell ontogeny . Moreover , the restriction of OTR transcription to T cell lines derived from thymic lymphomas may be important in the context of T cell leukemia pathogenesis and treatment .
