A Q8NBP7 -binding antibody that structurally mimics the P01133 (A) domain of LDL-receptor reduces LDL cholesterol in vivo . Proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin type 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) regulates LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting P01130 ( LDLr ) -mediated cellular LDL uptake . We have identified a fragment antigen-binding ( Fab ) 1D05 which binds Q8NBP7 with nanomolar affinity . The fully human antibody 1D05-IgG2 completely blocks the inhibitory effects of wild-type Q8NBP7 and two gain-of-function human Q8NBP7 mutants , S127R and D374Y . The crystal structure of 1D05-Fab bound to Q8NBP7 reveals that 1D05-Fab binds to an epitope on the Q8NBP7 catalytic domain which includes the entire LDLr P01133 (A) binding site . Notably , the 1D05-Fab CDR-H3 and CDR-H2 loops structurally mimic the P01133 (A) domain of LDLr . In a transgenic mouse model ( P11597 /LDLr-hemi ) , in which plasma lipid and Q8NBP7 profiles are comparable to those of humans , 1D05-IgG2 reduces plasma LDL cholesterol to 40 % and raises hepatic LDLr protein levels approximately fivefold . Similarly , in healthy rhesus monkeys , 1D05-IgG2 effectively reduced LDL cholesterol 20 % -50 % for over 2 weeks , despite its relatively short terminal half-life ( t(1/2) = 3.2 days ) . Importantly , the decrease in circulating LDL cholesterol corresponds closely to the reduction in free Q8NBP7 levels . Together these results clearly demonstrate that the LDL-lowering effect of the neutralizing anti- Q8NBP7 1D05-IgG2 antibody is mediated by reducing the amount of Q8NBP7 that can bind to the LDLr .
