Emergence of FGFR family gene fusions as therapeutic targets in a wide spectrum of solid tumours . The emergence of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) family fusions across diverse cancers has brought attention to FGFR-derived cancer therapies . The discovery of the first recurrent FGFR fusion in glioblastoma was followed by discoveries of FGFR fusions in bladder , lung , breast , thyroid , oral , and prostate cancers . Drug targeting of FGFR fusions has shown promising results and should soon be translating into clinical trials . FGFR fusions form as a result of various mechanisms – predominantly deletion for P11362 , translocation for P21802 , and tandem duplication for P22607 . The ability to exploit the unique targetability of FGFR fusions proves that FGFR-derived therapies could have a promising future in cancer therapeutics . Drug targeting of fusion genes has proven to be an extremely effective therapeutic approach for cancers such as the recurrent BCR– P00519 fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia . The recent discovery of recurrent FGFR family fusions in several cancer types has brought to attention the unique therapeutic potential for FGFR-positive patients . Understanding the diverse mechanisms of FGFR fusion formation and their oncogenic potential will shed light on the impact of FGFR-derived therapy in the future .
