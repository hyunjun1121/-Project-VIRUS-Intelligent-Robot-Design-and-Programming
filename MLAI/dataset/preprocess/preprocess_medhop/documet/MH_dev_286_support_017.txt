DB00227 -stimulated superinduction of P16581 , P05362 and P19320 in P01375 activated human vascular endothelial cells . Inhibitors of P04035 ( statins ) reveal important pharmacological effects in addition to reducing the plasma LDL cholesterol level . In the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis , transendothelial migration of various leukocytes including monocytes is a crucial step . We , therefore , investigated the expression of P16581 , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P05362 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P19320 ) in vascular endothelial cells as influenced by lovastatin . Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) express significant amounts of selectins and cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) within a few hours after stimulation with P01375 . This effect is potentiated by 100-200 % when the cells are pretreated with 0.1-2.5 microM lovastatin . The lovastatin-mediated increase in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface is dose-dependent and significant at lovastatin concentrations comparable to plasma levels in patients under lovastatin treatment . The lovastatin-potentiated increase of P16581 and CAMs is correlated with a corresponding increase of selectin- and P62158 -specific mRNA . We conclude that , in vivo , statin treatment could trigger an enhanced recruitment of macrophages that might support the cholesteryl ester efflux from the arteriosclerotic plaque .
