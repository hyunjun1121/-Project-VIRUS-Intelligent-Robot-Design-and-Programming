Targeting MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer . Effective management of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) remains an important unmet medical need . MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) are rational targets for intervention in CRPC . Clinical trials involving agents that inhibit one but not both pathways have reported modest activity and no improvement in overall survival . DB08875 is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits both MET and P35968 . A phase II randomized discontinuation study involving subjects with CRPC demonstrated that cabozantinib therapy is associated with improvement in bone scans , bone turnover markers , and pain response , but with significant adverse events leading to dose reduction and treatment discontinuation . Lower doses of cabozantinib retain high levels of activity with less toxicity . Ongoing phase III clinical trials will define the role of cabozantinib in CRPC . We summarize the rationale for targeting MET and VEGFR pathways in CRPC and the clinical data available to date .
