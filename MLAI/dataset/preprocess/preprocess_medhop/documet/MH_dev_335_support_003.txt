O95361 inhibits proliferation and migration through regulation of interferon beta 1 in melanoma cells . High basal or induced expression of the tripartite motif protein , O95361 , leads to reduce cell growth and migration of neuroblastoma and skin squamous cell carcinoma cells . However , the role of O95361 in melanoma is currently unknown . O95361 protein levels were markedly reduced in human melanoma cell lines , compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes due to both DNA methylation and reduced protein stability . O95361 knockdown strongly increased cell migration in normal human epidermal melanocytes , while O95361 overexpression reduced cell migration and proliferation of melanoma cells in an interferon beta 1 ( IFNβ1 ) -dependent manner . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed O95361 directly bound the IFNβ1 gene promoter . Low level O95361 expression in 91 melanoma patient samples , strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis , and , predicted poor patient prognosis in a separate cohort of 170 melanoma patients with lymph node metastasis . The P15056 inhibitor , vemurafenib , increased O95361 protein levels in melanoma cells in vitro , and induced growth arrest in P15056 -mutant melanoma cells in a O95361 -dependent manner . High levels of O95361 in melanoma tissues from patients treated with DB08881 correlated with clinical response . Our data , for the first time , demonstrates O95361 is a marker of cell migration and metastasis , and a novel treatment target in melanoma .
