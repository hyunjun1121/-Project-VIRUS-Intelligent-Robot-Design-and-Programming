DB01012 upregulates calcium-sensing receptors of parathyroid glands in hemodialysis patients . BACKGROUND : DB01012 hydrochloride ( cinacalcet ) , a calcimimetic , has been shown to upregulate calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) expression in parathyroid glands of rats with chronic renal insufficiency . However , the effect of cinacalcet on the reduced P41180 expression in human parathyroid glands remains to be elucidated . METHODS : Four normal parathyroid glands and 71 hyperplastic parathyroid glands from 18 hemodialysis patients with refractory secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) treated with ( n = 10 ; cinacalcet group ) or without ( n = 8 ; conventional group ) cinacalcet were examined immunohistochemically with a specific antibody against P41180 . The expression level of P41180 was analyzed semiquantitatively . RESULTS : Compared with normal glands , the immunohistochemical expression of P41180 was decreased significantly in both the cinacalcet and conventional groups . In the cinacalcet group , the expression of P41180 was increased significantly compared with that in the conventional group ( 1.83 ± 0.14 vs. 0.87 ± 0.15 , p < 0.001 ) , even though the proportion of patients using vitamin D sterols and the mean administered dose of calcitriol equivalents were not significantly different between the two groups . The expression of P41180 was significantly decreased in the larger glands ( > 500 mg ) compared with that in the smaller glands ( < 500 mg ) in both groups ; furthermore , it was markedly decreased in areas of nodular hyperplasia compared with diffuse hyperplasia in the cinacalcet group . CONCLUSIONS : Our results indicate that cinacalcet upregulates the depressed expression of P41180 in hemodialysis patients with SHPT , and that insufficient expression of P41180 , especially in larger glands with advanced nodular hyperplasia , underlies the pathogenesis of SHPT in patients who are resistant to cinacalcet .
