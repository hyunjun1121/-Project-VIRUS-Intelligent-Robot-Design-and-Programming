Irritable bowel syndrome : methods , mechanisms , and pathophysiology . Genetic epidemiology and pharmacogenetics in irritable bowel syndrome . The objectives of this review are twofold . Our first objective is to evaluate the evidence supporting a role for genetics in irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) . Specific examples of the associations of genetic variation and symptoms , syndromes , and intermediate phenotypes , including neurotransmitter ( serotonergic , α(2)-adrenergic , and cannabinoid ) mechanisms , inflammatory pathways ( P22301 , TNFα , GNβ3 , and susceptibility loci involved in Crohn 's disease ) , and bile acid metabolism , are explored . The second objective is to review pharmacogenetics in IBS , with the focus on cytochrome P-450 metabolism of drugs used in IBS , modulation of motor and sensory responses to serotonergic agents based on the 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) transporter-linked polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR ) and 5-HT(3) genetic variants , responses to a nonselective cannabinoid agonist ( dronabinol ) based on cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) and fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) variation , and responses to a bile acid ( sodium chenodeoxycholate ) and bile acid binding ( colesevelam ) based on klothoβ ( Q86Z14 ) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 ( P22455 ) variation . Overall , there is limited evidence of a genetic association with IBS ; the most frequently studied association is with 5-HTTLPR , and the most replicated association is with P01375 superfamily member 15 . Most of the pharmacogenetic associations are reported with intermediate phenotypes in relatively small trials , and confirmation in large clinical trials using validated clinical end points is still required . No published genome-wide association studies in functional gastrointestinal or motility disorders have been published .
