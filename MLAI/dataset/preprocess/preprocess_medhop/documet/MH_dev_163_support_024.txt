Genotypes associated with lipid metabolism contribute to differences in serum lipid profile of GH-deficient adults before and after GH replacement therapy . OBJECTIVE : GH deficiency ( GHD ) in adults is associated with an altered serum lipid profile that responds to GH replacement therapy ( GHRT ) . This study evaluated the influence of polymorphisms in genes related to lipid metabolism on serum lipid profile before and after 1 year of GHRT in adults . DESIGN AND METHODS : In 318 GHD patients , total cholesterol ( TC ) serum concentrations , LDL-C , HDL-C , and triglycerides ( TG ) were assessed . Using a candidate gene approach , 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were genotyped . GH dose was individually titrated to obtain normal serum IGF1 concentrations . RESULTS : At baseline , the minor alleles of cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) gene SNPs rs708272 and rs1800775 were associated with higher serum TC and apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) gene SNP rs7412 with lower TC concentrations ; P11597 SNPs rs708272 , rs1800775 , and rs3764261 and apolipoprotein B ( P04114 ) gene SNP rs693 with higher serum HDL-C ; P02649 SNP rs7412 , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( P37231 ) gene SNP rs10865710 with lower LDL-C , and P11597 SNP rs1800775 with higher LDL-C ; and P02649 /C1/C4/ P06681 cluster SNP rs35136575 with lower serum TG . After treatment , P04114 SNP rs676210 GG genotype was associated with larger reductions in TC and LDL-C and P37231 SNP rs10865710 CC genotype with greater TC reduction . All associations remained significant when adjusted for age , sex , and BMI . CONCLUSIONS : In GHD adults , multiple SNPs in genes related to lipid metabolism contributed to individual differences in baseline serum lipid profile . The GH treatment response in TC and LDL-C was influenced by polymorphisms in the P04114 and P37231 genes .
