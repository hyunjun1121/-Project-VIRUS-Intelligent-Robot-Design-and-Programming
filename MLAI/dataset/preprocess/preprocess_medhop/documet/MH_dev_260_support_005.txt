Prostaglandin synthase 2/cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 / P35354 ) 8473T > C polymorphism associated with prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin . PURPOSE : The present study analyzed the polymorphisms of apoptosis-related genes and their impact on the response to chemotherapy and survival of patients with colorectal cancer . PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 76 patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) combination chemotherapy were enrolled in the present study . The single nucleotide polymorphisms of 15 apoptosis-related genes ( P04637 , Q07817 , O14763 , P31749 , P35354 / P35354 , P55957 , Q13546 , FAS , P48023 , caspase 3 , and caspase 6-10 ) were determined using a PCR-RFLP assay . RESULTS : No significant association between the polymorphisms and the response was found for any of the genes analyzed . However , the T/T genotype of P35354 8473T > C ( rs5275 ) was significantly correlated with a better progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) when compared to the combined T/C and C/C genotype ( Hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.47 ; P value = 0.046 and HR = 0.16 ; P = 0.013 , respectively ) in a multivariate analysis adjusted for age , sex , performance status , disease status and curative resection . No association was noted between the other polymorphisms and survival . CONCLUSION : The P35354 8473T > C polymorphism was found to be correlated with PFS and OS in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with XELOX chemotherapy .
