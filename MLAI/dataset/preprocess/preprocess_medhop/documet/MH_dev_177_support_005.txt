Comprehensive expression analysis of prostanoid enzymes and receptors in the human endometrium across the menstrual cycle . Prostanoids are well-described primary mediators of inflammatory processes and are essential for the normal physiological function of the female reproductive system . The aim of this study was to determine the temporal expression of the prostanoid biosynthetic enzymes ( P23219 , P35354 , O14684 , Q9H7Z7 , Q15185 , P15121 , P42330 , P16152 , O60760 , P41222 , Q16647 , P24557 and P15428 ) and the prostanoid receptors ( P34995 , PTGER2 , P43115 , P35408 , P43088 , Q13258 , Q9Y5Y4 , P43119 and P21731 ) in the human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle . The analysis identified P43088 to have a distinct expression profile compared with other components of the prostanoid system , as expression is maximal during the proliferative phase . Immunohistochemical analysis for P34995 suggests a dual function for this receptor depending on its temporal ( proliferative versus secretory ) and spatial ( nuclear versus cell membrane ) expression . The expression profiles of the P49763 (2α) synthases identified P15121 and P16152 as the likely regulators of P49763 (2α) production during the menstrual phase . Immunohistochemical analysis for P15121 , P16152 and P42330 suggest expression to be in the glandular epithelium and vasculature . This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the components of prostanoid biosynthetic and signalling pathway in the human endometrium . The expression profiles described have the potential to identify specific prostanoid components that may be dysregulated in inflammatory-associated disorders of the endometrium .
