Reduced plasminogen activator content of the endometrium in oral contraceptive users . Human endometrium was found to contain two different plasminogen activators , urokinase and tissue activator . DB00013 was released in higher amounts from endometrial tissue explants obtained in the midcycle phase than from those obtained in the luteal phase . P00747 activator activity of the culture medium followed the same pattern . Treatment of postmenopausal patients with ethinylestradiol resulted in liberation of urokinase and tissue activator from endometrial explants in concentrations similar to those found in the normal midcycle phase . In contrast , treatment with oral contraceptives ( OCs ) , containing ethinylestradiol and a progestagen , resulted in lowered release of both activators , even lower than was found during the normal luteal phase . Also the amounts of extractable urokinase from endometrial tissue samples were significantly lower in OC-users than in non-users . Estradiol seems to have a stimulatory effect on the release of plasminogen activators from the endometrium ; whereas , gestagens depress the content and release of activators . The low content of plasminogen activators in the endometrium explains the reduced menstrual bleedings found in OC-users .
