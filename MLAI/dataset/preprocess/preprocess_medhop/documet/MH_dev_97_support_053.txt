Novel non-genomic signaling of thyroid hormone receptors in thyroid carcinogenesis . The thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs ) are transcription factors that mediate the pleiotropic activities of the thyroid hormone , DB00279 . Four DB00279 -binding isoforms , TRalpha1 , TRbeta1 , TRbeta2 , and TRbeta3 , are encoded by two genes , P10827 and P10828 . Mutations and altered expression of TRs have been reported in human cancers . A targeted germ-line mutation of the Thrbeta gene in the mouse leads to spontaneous development of follicular thyroid carcinoma ( TRbeta(PV/PV) mouse ) . The TRbetaPV mutant has lost DB00279 -binding activity and displays potent dominant negative activity . The striking phenotype of thyroid cancer exhibited by TRbeta(PV/PV) mice has recently led to the discovery of novel non-genomic actions of TRbetaPV that contribute to thyroid carcinogenesis . These actions involve direct physical interaction of TRbetaPV with cellular proteins , namely the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( p85alpha ) , the pituitary tumor transforming gene ( O95997 ) and beta-catenin , that are critically involved in cell proliferation , motility , migration , and metastasis . Thus , a TRbeta mutant ( TRbetaPV ) , via a novel mode of non-genomic action , acts as an oncogene in thyroid carcinogenesis .
