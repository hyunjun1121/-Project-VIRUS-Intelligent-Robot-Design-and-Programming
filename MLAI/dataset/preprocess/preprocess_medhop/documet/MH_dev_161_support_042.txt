Human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced in vitro by P40189 stimulation . OBJECTIVES : Recent in vivo and in vitro studies in animals have demonstrated that cytokines of the P05231 family are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and in protection of cardiomyocytes against apoptosis . The present study aims to analyse the capacity of human atrial cardiac cells ( i.e. , cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts ) to display the P40189 receptor subunit , and to evaluate its functionality . METHODS : Twenty human atrial biopsies were used for immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridisation , and western blot analysis or dissociated for isolation and primary culture of cardiac cells . RESULTS : Fibroblasts present in tissue or maintained in primary culture clearly express P40189 whereas the signal in cardiomyocytes is weaker . Culture of cardiac cells with a P40189 agonist antibody enhances atrial natriuretic peptide ( P01160 ) , beta myosin heavy chain ( beta-MHC ) expression in cardiomyocytes , and significantly increases the cell surface area microm(2) ) . This process could involve P40763 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that P40189 activation in human cardiac cells leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . We discuss several hypotheses on the role of P05231 -type cytokines on cardiomyocyte functions .
