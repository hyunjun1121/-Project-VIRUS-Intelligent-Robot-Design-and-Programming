Evaluation of neprilysin sequence variation in relation to P04141 β-Amyloid levels and Alzheimer disease risk . P08473 ( NEP ) is a principal peptidase involved in the degradation of β-amyloid ( Aβ ) , and as such its encoding gene ( MME ) has been the target of numerous genetic association studies on Alzheimer disease . Here , in order to attempt replication of previous findings we have investigated several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that have been claimed to be associated with AD . A key feature of the present study is the complementary investigation of both AD risk and quantitative measures of AD severity , including cerebrospinal ( P04141 ) fluid levels of P05412 -42 . In contrast to the effects of P02649 , none of these measures are detectably influenced by genetic polymorphism in the MME region . We thus , fail to find support for previous results suggesting that MME impacts AD .
