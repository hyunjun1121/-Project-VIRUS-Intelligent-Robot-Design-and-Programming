Novel piperazine-based compounds inhibit microtubule dynamics and sensitize colon cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis . We recently identified a series of mitotically acting piperazine-based compounds that potently increase the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to apoptotic ligands . Here we describe a structure-activity relationship study on this compound class and identify a highly active derivative ( (4-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)(2-ethoxyphenyl)methanone ) , referred to as AK301 , the activity of which is governed by the positioning of functional groups on the phenyl and benzoyl rings . AK301 induced mitotic arrest in HT29 human colon cancer cells with an ED50 of ≈115 nm . Although AK301 inhibited growth of normal lung fibroblast cells , mitotic arrest was more pronounced in the colon cancer cells ( 50 % versus 10 % ) . Cells arrested by AK301 showed the formation of multiple microtubule organizing centers with O14965 and γ-tubulin . Employing in vitro and in vivo assays , tubulin polymerization was found to be slowed ( but not abolished ) by AK301 . In silico molecular docking suggests that AK301 binds to the colchicine-binding domain on β-tubulin , but in a novel orientation . Cells arrested by AK301 expressed elevated levels of P19438 on their surface and more readily activated caspases-8 , -9 , and -3 in the presence of P01375 . Relative to other microtubule destabilizers , AK301 was the most active P01375 -sensitizing agent and also stimulated Fas- and P50591 -induced apoptosis . In summary , we report a new class of mitosis-targeting agents that effectively sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic ligands . These compounds should help illuminate the role of microtubules in regulating apoptotic ligand sensitivity and may ultimately be useful for developing agents that augment the anti-cancer activities of the immune response .
