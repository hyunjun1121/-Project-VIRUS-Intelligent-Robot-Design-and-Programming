Disrupted coordinate regulation of farnesoid X receptor target genes in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis . Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) , sterol 27-hydroxylase ( Q02318 ) deficiency , is associated with markedly reduced chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , the most powerful activating ligand for farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) . We investigated the effects of reduced DB06777 on Q96RI1 target genes in humans . Liver specimens from an untreated CTX patient and 10 control subjects were studied . In the patient , hepatic DB06777 concentration was markedly reduced but the bile alcohol level exceeded DB06777 levels in control subjects ( 73.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.2 nmol/g liver ) . DB04540 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) and Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide ( Q14973 ) were upregulated 84- and 8-fold , respectively . However , small heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) and bile salt export pump were normally expressed . Marked P22680 induction with normal Q15466 expression was not explained by the regulation of liver X receptor alpha ( LXRalpha ) or pregnane X receptor . However , another nuclear receptor , hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha ( HNF4alpha ) , was induced 2.9-fold in CTX , which was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of HNF4alpha target genes , P22680 , 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12alpha-hydroxylase , Q02318 , and Q14973 . In conclusion , the coordinate regulation of Q96RI1 target genes was lost in CTX . The mechanism of the disruption may be explained by a normally stimulated Q96RI1 pathway attributable to markedly increased bile alcohols with activation of HNF4alpha caused by reduced bile acids in CTX liver .
