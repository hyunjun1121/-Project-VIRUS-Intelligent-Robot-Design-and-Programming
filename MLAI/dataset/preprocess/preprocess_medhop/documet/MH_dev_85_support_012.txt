Elevation of P13500 and P13500 / P15692 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive cell death of upper and lower motor neurons . In this study , we measured monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( P13500 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) levels in cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) and serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) in 42 P35858 patients , and compared these levels with those of control subjects with other neurodegenerative disorders or with those of normal controls . P13500 levels in P04141 were significantly higher in P35858 patients than in the control group . P15692 levels in P04141 tended to be lower in P35858 patients than in the control group , but not significantly . A positive correlation was found between P13500 levels in P04141 of P35858 patients and the total Norris scale . The elevation of P13500 / P15692 ratio in P04141 was more specific to P35858 patients compared to other neurological diseases such as Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) and to controls . Our data suggested that both P13500 levels and P13500 / P15692 ratio in P04141 may be useful markers for the clinical diagnosis of P35858 .
