Effect of isoproterenol and dexamethasone on the lipopolysaccharide induced expression of CD11b on bovine neutrophils . The present experiments investigate the changes in expression of CD11b on bovine neutrophils and its modulation by isopropylnoradrenaline ( IPN , isoproterenol ) , dexamethasone ( DX ) , phenylephrine ( alpha-agonist ) and clenbuterol ( beta-agonist ) . Both IPN and DX caused a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced CD11b expression . A combination of IPN and DX elicited a synergistical decrease of the CD11b expression . DB01407 mimicked the effect of IPN , whereas phenylephrine did not . The effect of IPN and DX could at least partly be mediated through a decreased P01375 production by monocytes since tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) is shown to mediate a dose-dependent CD11b up-regulation . Stimulation of stress hormone receptors partly immuno-suppresses neutrophil functions by inhibition of CD11b expression on the neutrophil surface upon LPS stimulation . This inhibition is probably related to a decrease in P01375 production . A similar mechanism of immuno-suppression could contribute to the higher susceptibility of cattle to Gram-negative bacterial infections of the udder and lung during periods of stress .
