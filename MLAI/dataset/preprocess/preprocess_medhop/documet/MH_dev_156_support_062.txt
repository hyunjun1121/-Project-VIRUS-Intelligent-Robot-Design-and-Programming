Different expression of PGE synthase , P43088 , P01375 , Fas and oxytocin in the bovine corpus luteum of the estrous cycle and pregnancy . Functional differences between the corpus luteum ( CL ) of pregnancy and CL of the cycle in cows were examined . Messenger RNA and protein levels of prostaglandin ( PG ) E synthase ( O14684 ) , PGF2α receptor ( PGFR ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 ) and Fas were found to be higher in the CL of pregnancy than in CL of the cycle . DB00107 ( OT ) mRNA and protein levels were lower in the CL of pregnancy . Messenger RNA levels of progesterone receptor ( PR ) , luteinizing hormone receptor ( LHR ) , DB00917 receptor ( PGER ) , P49763 synthase ( P42330 ) , P01375 receptor type I ( TNFRI ) and P01375 receptor type II ( TNFRII ) did not differ between the cycle and pregnancy . DB00917 and PGF2α production by cultured bovine endometrial tissues was decreased by a supernatant derived from the homogenized CL of pregnancy but not by that of the CL of the cycle , suggesting that specific substances in the CL of pregnancy affect endometrial PG production in cows . Collectively , O14684 , PGFR , P01375 , Fas or OT may contribute to differences between the CL of pregnancy and CL of the estrous cycle in cows .
