Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockade inhibits platelet-mediated force development and reduces gel elastic modulus . The effects of P08514 /IIIa blockade on clot retraction were studied utilizing an instrument which directly measures force produced by platelets . P08514 /IIIa disruption by calcium chelation , and P08514 /IIIa blockade by peptides and anti- P08514 /IIIa antibodies were investigated . One mM DB00974 suppressed ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 72 % and reduced force developed at 1200 s by 33 % . At 234 microM , the tetrapeptide DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 - DB00133 ( RGDS ) suppressed platelet aggregation by 74 % , reduced force at 1200 s by 45 % and reduced gel elastic modulus by 19 % . At 10 microM , the peptide D- DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 -L-Try ( D-RGDW ) completely suppressed platelet aggregation , reduced force development by 38 % and reduced gel elastic modulus by 29 % . At 0.133 microM , monoclonal anti- P05106 antibody ( AP-3 ) reduced force development by 74 % and reduced gel modulus by 60 % . Murine antiGPIIb/IIIa antibodies 10E5 and 7E3 markedly suppressed force development . At 0.133 microM , 10E5 reduced force by 89 % and reduced gel modulus by 67 % . At 0.053 microM , 7E3 completely stopped force development and reduced gel modulus by 46 % . Platelet aggregation was blocked by 0.027 microM DB00054 . Selective P08514 blockade by antibodies did not affect force development . None of the agents studied altered fibrin structure as monitored by effects of fibrin mass/length ratios . Suppression of platelet aggregation occurred at inhibitor concentrations substantially lower than those required to suppress force development . Complete suppression of platelet aggregation did not assure inhibition of clot retraction probably due to profound platelet activation by thrombin. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
