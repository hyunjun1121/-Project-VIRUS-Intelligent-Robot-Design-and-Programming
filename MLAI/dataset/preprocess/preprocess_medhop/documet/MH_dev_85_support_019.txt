Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics in children during induction for acute lymphoblastic leukemia : A pilot study . BACKGROUND : Thrombosis in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) can develop after treatment with L-asparaginase ( asp ) and is often localized to the central nervous system ( CNS ) . We hypothesize that changes in the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) proteome will occur after asp therapy and will anticipate CNS clots . METHODS : Five newly diagnosed patients , ages 1-11 years , with ALL ( n = 4 ) or lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LL ) ( n = 1 ) underwent serial lumbar punctures during induction . P04141 was depleted of abundant plasma proteins and analyzed by gel-free , label-free quantitative proteomics . RESULTS : More than 600 proteins were quantified across all P04141 samples . In four subjects , the expression of proteins involved in coagulation such as protein C Inhibitor ( P05154 ) and heparin cofactor II ( P05546 ) changed over the course of asp therapy . Antithrombin III ( P01008 ) and plasminogen ( PLMN ) levels were shown to have decreased expression over time in one child who developed a CNS thrombosis , compared to other subjects . CONCLUSIONS : P04141 proteomics is feasible and reproducible in ALL and LL . P04141 P01008 and PLMN should be further investigated as predictive markers of CNS thrombosis .
