Disulfide-dependent protein folding is linked to operation of the vitamin K cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum . A protein disulfide isomerase- Q9BQB6 redox enzyme complex appears to be responsible for vitamin P04264 2,3-epoxide reduction . Gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins is dependent on formation of reduced vitamin P04264 ( Vit.K1H2 ) in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , where it works as an essential cofactor for gamma-carboxylase in post-translational gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins . Vit.K1H2 is produced by the warfarin-sensitive enzyme vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase ( Q9BQB6 ) of the vitamin K cycle that has been shown to harbor a thioredoxin-like CXXC center involved in reduction of vitamin P04264 2,3-epoxide ( Vit.K > O ) . However , the cellular system providing electrons to the center is unknown . Here data are presented that demonstrate that reduction is linked to dithiol-dependent oxidative folding of proteins in the ER by protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) . Oxidative folding of reduced RNase is shown to trigger reduction of Vit.K > O and gamma-carboxylation of the synthetic gamma-carboxylase peptide substrate FLEEL . In liver microsomes , reduced RNase-triggered gamma-carboxylation is inhibited by the P07237 inhibitor bacitracin and also by small interfering RNA silencing of P07237 in P29320 293 cells . Immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of microsomal membrane proteins demonstrate the existence of a Q9BQB6 enzyme complex where P07237 and Q9BQB6 appear to be tightly associated subunits . We propose that the P07237 subunit of the complex provides electrons for reduction of the thioredoxin-like CXXC center in Q9BQB6 . We can conclude that the energy required for gamma-carboxylation of proteins is provided by dithiol-dependent oxidative protein folding in the ER and thus is linked to de novo protein synthesis .
