A guide to picking the most selective kinase inhibitor tool compounds for pharmacological validation of drug targets . To establish the druggability of a target , genetic validation needs to be supplemented with pharmacological validation . Pharmacological studies , especially in the kinase field , are hampered by the fact that many reference inhibitors are not fully selective for one target . Fortunately , the initial trickle of selective inhibitors released in the public domain has steadily swelled into a stream . However , rationally picking the most selective tool compound out of the increasing amounts of available inhibitors has become progressively difficult due to the lack of accurate quantitative descriptors of drug selectivity . A recently published approach , termed ' selectivity entropy ' , is an improved way of expressing selectivity as a single-value parameter and enables rank ordering of inhibitors . We provide a guide to select the best tool compounds for pharmacological validation experiments of candidate drug targets using selectivity entropy . In addition , we recommend which inhibitors to use for studying the biology of the 20 most investigated kinases that are clinically relevant : Abl ( P00519 ) , P31749 , Q9UM73 , Aurora A/B , CDKs , MET , P07333 ( P07333 ) , P00533 , P36888 , P04626 ( P04626 ) , O14920 ( O14920 ) , O60674 /3 , P45983 /2/3 ( P45983 /9/10 ) , Q02750 /2 , P53350 , PI3Ks , p38Î± ( Q16539 ) , P15056 , P12931 and P35968 ( P35968 ) .
