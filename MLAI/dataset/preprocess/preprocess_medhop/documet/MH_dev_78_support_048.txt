DB00945 minimized the pro-metastasis effect of sorafenib and improved survival by up-regulating Q9BUP3 in hepatocellular carcinoma . BACKGROUND AIMS : We previously demonstrated the pro-metastasis effect of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , which is mediated by down-regulation of tumor suppressor Q9BUP3 . The aim of the present study was to determine whether aspirin minimizes this effect and improves survival . METHODS : The effects of sorafenib , aspirin , and combined sorafenib and aspirin were observed in HCCLM3 and HepG2 xenograft nude mice . Tumor growth , intrahepatic metastasis ( IHM ) , lung metastasis , and survival were assessed . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) array , real-time ( RT ) -PCR , and Western blotting were used to examine gene expression . The anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effects of aspirin were studied in Q9BUP3 -knockdown and Q9BUP3 -overexpressing HCC cell lines . The molecular mechanism of Q9BUP3 regulation by aspirin was explored . RESULTS : DB00945 suppressed the pro-invasion and pro-metastasis effects of sorafenib in HCC and up-regulated Q9BUP3 expression . DB00945 did not inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells , but it decreased the invasiveness of HCC with lower expression of Q9BUP3 and increased expression of a set of markers , indicating a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in tumor cells . The up-regulation of HTATPI2 expression by aspirin is most likely mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) 2 expression . CONCLUSIONS : DB00945 minimized the pro-metastasis effect of sorafenib by up-regulating the tumor suppressor Q9BUP3 ; this mechanism is mediated through inhibition of P35354 .
