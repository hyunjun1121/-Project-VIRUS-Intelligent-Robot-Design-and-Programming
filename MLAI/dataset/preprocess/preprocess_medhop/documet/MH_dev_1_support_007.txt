Q9UBP4 maintains the PANC-1 human pancreatic tumor cells in a dedifferentiated state . Pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in Western societies , with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ( PDACs ) accounting for > 90 % of such cases . PDAC is a heterogeneous disease that includes a subset showing overexpression of the secreted glycoprotein Q9UBP4 ( Q9UBP4 ) , a protein shown to be downregulated in various cancers of different tissues . The biological function of Q9UBP4 in this subset was studied using the Q9UBP4 expressing PANC-1 cell line as a model for PDACs . The influence of Q9UBP4 overexpression and knockdown on cellular differentiation and proliferation of PANC-1 was investigated . Confocal microscopy showed that Q9UBP4 was expressed in a fraction of PANC-1 cells . While lentiviral-mediated overexpression of Q9UBP4 did not alter cellular proliferation , knockdown of Q9UBP4 resulted in significant reduction of cellular proliferation and concomitant induction of cell cycle inhibitors P42772 ( p15INK4b ) , P38936 ( p21CIP1 ) and P46527 ( p27KIP1 ) . In parallel , pancreatic epithelial cell differentiation markers P04746 , Q9UNI1 , P17538 , P01275 , P16278 and P01308 were significantly upregulated . PANC-1 cells differentiated using exendin-4 showed analogous induction of cell cycle inhibitors and differentiation markers . Thus , we conclude that Q9UBP4 is required to maintain a highly dedifferentiated and consequently proliferative state in PANC-1 , indicating a similar function in the Q9UBP4 overexpressing subset of PDACs . Therefore , Q9UBP4 represents a potential target for the treatment of Q9UBP4 -positive subtypes of PaCa to drive cells into cell cycle arrest and differentiation .
