Identification and analysis of specific chromosomal region adjacent to exogenous Dhfr-amplified region in Chinese hamster ovary cell genome . Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells are widely used for the stable production of recombinant proteins . Gene amplification techniques are frequently used to improve of protein production , and the dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) gene amplification system is most widely used in the CHO cell line . We previously constructed a CHO genomic bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) library from a mouse Dhfr-amplified CHO DR1000L-4N cell line and one BAC clone ( Cg0031N14 ) containing the CHO genomic DNA sequence adjacent to Dhfr was selected . To identify the specific chromosomal region adjacent to the exogenous Dhfr-amplified region in the CHO cell genome , we performed further screening of BAC clones to obtain other Dhfr-amplified regions in the CHO genome . From the screening by high-density replica filter hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled pSV2-dhfr/hGM- P04141 probe , we obtained 8 new BAC clones containing a Dhfr-amplified region . To define the structures of the 8 BAC clones , Southern blot analysis , BAC end sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q5TCZ1 ) were performed . These results revealed that all the selected BAC clones contained a large palindrome structure with a small inverted repeat in the junction region . This suggests that the obtained amplicon structure in the Dhfr-amplified region in the CHO genome plays an important role in exogenous gene amplification .
