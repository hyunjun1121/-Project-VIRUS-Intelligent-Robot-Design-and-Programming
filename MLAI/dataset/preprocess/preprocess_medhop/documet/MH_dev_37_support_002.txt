Rosiglitazone regulates P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , a proinflammatory cytokine , stimulates adipocyte lipolysis and induces insulin resistance in obese and diabetic subjects . However , the effects of the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone on P05231 -stimulated lipolysis and the underlying molecular mechanism are largely unknown . In this study , we demonstrated that rosiglitazone suppressed P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in differentiated porcine adipocytes by inactivation of extracellular signal-related kinase ( P29323 ) . Meanwhile , rosiglitazone enhanced the lipolysis response of adipocytes to isoprenaline . In addition , rosiglitazone significantly reversed P05231 -induced down-regulation of several genes such as perilipin A , peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 & gamma ; ) , and fatty acid synthetase , as well as the up-regulation of P05231 mRNA . However , mRNA expression of Q07869 & gamma ; coactivator-1 alpha ( DB01053 -1 & alpha ; ) was enhanced by rosiglitazone in P05231 -stimulated adipocytes . These results indicate that rosiglitazone suppresses P05231 -stimulated lipolysis in porcine adipocytes through multiple molecular mechanisms .
