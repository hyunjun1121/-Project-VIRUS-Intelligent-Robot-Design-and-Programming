Deciphering the molecular and biologic processes that mediate histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced thrombocytopenia . Histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACI ) -induced thrombocytopenia ( DB01520 ) is a major dose-limiting toxicity of this new class of drugs . Using preclinical models to study the molecular and biologic events that underpin this effect of HDACI , we found that C57BL/6 mice treated with both the Q13547 /2-selective HDACI romidepsin and the pan-HDACI DB06603 developed significant DB01520 . HDACI-induced DB01520 was not due to myelosuppression or reduced platelet lifespan , but to decreased platelet release from megakaryocytes . Cultured primary murine megakaryocytes showed reductions in proplatelet extensions after HDACI exposure and a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 ( MLC2 ) . Phosphorylation of MLC to phospho-MLC ( pMLC ) and subsequent proplatelet formation in megakaryocytes is regulated by the Rho-GTPase proteins Rac1 , P60953 , and RhoA . Primary mouse megakaryocytes and the human megakaryoblastic cell line Meg-01 showed reductions in Rac1 , P60953 , and RhoA protein levels after treatment with HDACIs . We were able to overcome HDACI-induced DB01520 by administering the mouse-specific thrombopoietin ( P07202 ) mimetic AMP-4 , which improved platelet numbers to levels similar to untreated controls . Our report provides the first detailed account of the molecular and biologic processes involved in HDACI-mediated DB01520 . Moreover , our preclinical studies provide evidence that dose-limiting DB01520 induced by HDACIs may be circumvented using a P07202 mimetic .
