Anti-clastogenic effect of beta-glucan extracted from barley towards chemically induced DNA damage in rodent cells . beta-Glucan ( BG ) was tested in vitro to determine its potential clastogenic and/or anti-clastogenic activity , and attempts were made to elucidate its possible mechanism of action by using combinations with an inhibitor of DNA polymerase . The study was carried out on cells deficient ( CHO-k1 ) and cells proficient ( HTC ) in phases I and II enzymes , and the DNA damage was assessed by the chromosomal aberration assay . BG did not show a clastogenic effect , but was anti-clastogenic in both cell lines used , and at all concentrations tested ( 2.5 , 5 and 10 microg/mL ) in combination with damage inducing agents ( methylmethane sulfonate in cell line CHO-k1 , and methylmethane sulfonate or 2-aminoanthracene in cell line HTC ) . BG also showed a protective effect in the presence of a P06746 inhibitor ( cytosine arabinoside-3-phosphate , DB00987 ) , demonstrating that BG does not act through an anti-mutagenic mechanism of action involving P06746 .
