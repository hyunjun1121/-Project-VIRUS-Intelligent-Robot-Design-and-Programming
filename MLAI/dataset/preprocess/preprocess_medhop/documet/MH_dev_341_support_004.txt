P00747 activator inhibitor-1 promotes inflammatory process induced by cigarette smoke extraction or lipopolysaccharides in alveolar epithelial cells . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) plays a role in regulating levels of some cytokines and cell migration in addition to its classic role in inhibiting fibrinolysis . P05121 levels in induced-sputum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) patients were elevated significantly and correlated negatively with pulmonary function . To study the role of P05121 in inflammatory process in P48444 , the authors transfected alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs ) with siRNA-targeted P05121 and stimulated the cells by cigarette smoke extraction ( CSE ) or lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) . The expression of inflammatory factors , interleukin-8 ( P10145 ) and leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , and the monocyte migration were detected . The exposure to CSE or LPS induced the expression of P05121 , P10145 , and LTB4 in AECs and monocyte migration to AECs . However , they were attenuated after transfection with siRNA-targeted P05121 . In conclusion , P05121 stimulates inflammation induced by CSE or LPS in AECs through up-regulation of inflammatory factors and promoting inflammatory cell migration . P05121 may play a proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of P48444 .
