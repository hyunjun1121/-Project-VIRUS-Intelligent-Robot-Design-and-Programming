P10275 promotes esophageal cancer cell migration and proliferation via matrix metalloproteinase 2 . Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide . P10275 ( AR ) plays an important role in many kinds of cancers . However , the molecular mechanisms of AR in ESCC are poorly characterized . In the present study , Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to identify differentially expressed AR in 40 ESCC tissue samples , which revealed that the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein expression of AR is upregulated in the ESCC tissue samples . AR overexpression induced increases in ESCC cell invasion and proliferation in vitro . Silencing of AR inhibited the proliferation of KYSE450 cells which have a relatively high level of AR , and the invasion of KYSE450 cells was distinctly suppressed . Furthermore , AR knockdown led to substantial reductions in matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( P08253 ) and p-AKT levels in ESCC cell lines , but no significant change in AKT and P14780 expression . These results suggest that AR is involved in tumor progression , and thus , AR could represent selective targets for the molecularly targeted treatments of ESCC .
