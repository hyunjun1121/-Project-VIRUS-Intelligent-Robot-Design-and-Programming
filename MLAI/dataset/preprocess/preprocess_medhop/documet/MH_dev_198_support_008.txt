The post-operative analgesic efficacy and tolerability of lumiracoxib compared with placebo and naproxen after total knee or hip arthroplasty . BACKGROUND : DB01283 is a novel selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitor in development for the treatment of chronic and acute pain . METHODS : This randomized , double-blind multicentre study enrolled 180 patients ( aged 18-80 years ) with moderate-to-severe pain ( > or=2 on a 4-point categorical scale ) within 48 h of unilateral total knee or total hip arthroplasty . Patients were randomized to receive lumiracoxib 400 mg once daily ( n = 60 ) , placebo ( n = 60 ) or naproxen 500 mg twice daily ( n = 60 ) . The study consisted of a 12-h single-dose phase followed by a multiple-dose phase ( up to 96 h or until discontinuation ) . The primary efficacy measure was the summed ( time-weighted ) pain intensity difference over 0-8 h after the first dose ( SPID-8 ) . RESULTS : DB01283 and naproxen were comparable and both treatments were superior to placebo for the primary efficacy measure , SPID-8 . Both treatments were generally similar and also superior to placebo for the secondary efficacy measures during both the single- and multiple-dose phases for up to 96 h . Both active treatments were well tolerated . CONCLUSION : DB01283 is an effective alternative to traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) for the treatment of post-operative pain .
