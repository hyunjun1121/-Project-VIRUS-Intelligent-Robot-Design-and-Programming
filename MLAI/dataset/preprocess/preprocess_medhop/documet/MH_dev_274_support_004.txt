Inhibitory effect of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on the growth of P13671 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo . Caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( O95347 ) , a component of honeybee propolis , has been reported to hold various biochemical responses . In the preliminary study , we found that O95347 inhibited the growth of P13671 glioma cells in a dose dependent and time dependent manner as shown by the results of trypan blue dye exclusion assay and cell proliferation assay . In addition , the cell number percentage of the G0/ P55008 phase increased to 85 % after the treatment with 50 microM of O95347 for 24h . After treatment with O95347 ( 50 microM ) for 6h , it demonstrated that the protein level of hyperphosphorylated P06400 decreased , and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors P38936 , p27 , and p16 were marked up-regulated . The association of P24941 and cyclin E that affects the P24941 activity decreased . When P13671 cells were grown as xenografts in nude mice , treatment with O95347 ( 1-10mg/kg ; ip ) induced a significant dose dependent decrease in tumor growth by evaluating tumor volume and tumor weight . Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that O95347 treatment significantly reduced the number of mitotic cells and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) -positive cells in P13671 glioma . These results suggest that O95347 presents an antitumor potential for glioma by inhibiting the growth of tumor cells .
