Novel immunosuppression : small molecules and biologics . Kidney transplantation today has excellent short-term outcomes that have paralleled the use of new immunosuppressive agents introduced in the 1990s . In addition to reducing acute rejection , the goals for developing new agents is to improve long-term outcome , minimize nephrotoxicity , and reduce infectious , cardiovascular , and malignancy-related complications . Novel small molecules and biological agents currently in clinical development may help to minimize the use of calcineurin inhibitors and steroids . These small molecules include FTY720 , a sphingosine phosphate-receptor modulator , FK778 , an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis , CP-690550 , a P52333 inhibitor , and AEB-071 , a protein kinase C inhibitor . The biological agents include drugs targeting interleukin-15 , anti- P25942 , belatacept ( DB06681 ) , a second-generation CTLY4Ig that blocks the interaction between P33681 /86 and P10747 costimulatory pathways , and efalizumab , a humanized anti-LFA1 monoclonal antibody . These new agents currently in preclinical and clinical trials appear promising and may represent the emergence of novel immunosuppressive agents that can deliver immunosuppression without long-term toxicity .
