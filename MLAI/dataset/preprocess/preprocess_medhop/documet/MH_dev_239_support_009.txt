Tumour cell radiosensitization using constitutive ( CMV ) and radiation inducible ( P38936 ) promoters to drive the P35228 gene : a novel suicide gene therapy . DB00435 ( NO(*) ) has many characteristics including cytotoxicity , radiosensitization and anti-angiogenesis , which make it an attractive molecule for use in cancer therapy . We have investigated the use of P35228 gene transfer , driven by both a constitutive ( CMV ) and X-ray inducible ( P38936 ) promoter , for generating high concentrations of NO(*) within tumour cells . We have combined this treatment with radiation to exploit the radiosensitizing properties of this molecule . Transfection of murine Q9HBH0 -1 tumour cells in vitro with the P35228 constructs resulted in increased P35228 protein levels . Under hypoxic conditions cells were radiosensitized by delivery of both constructs so that these treatments effectively eliminated the radioresistance observed under hypoxic conditions . In vivo transfer of the CMV/ P35228 construct by direct tumour injection resulted in a delay ( 4.2 days ) in tumour growth compared with untreated controls . This was equivalent to the effect of 20 Gy X-rays alone . Combination of CMV/ P35228 gene transfer with 20 Gy X-rays resulted in a dramatic 19.8 day growth delay compared with controls . Tumours treated with the CMV/ P35228 showed large areas of necrosis and abundant apoptosis . We believe that P35228 gene transfer has the potential to be a highly effective treatment in combination with radiotherapy .
