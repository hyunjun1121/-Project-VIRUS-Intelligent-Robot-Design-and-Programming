Role of TGFbeta/Smad signaling in gremlin induction of human trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix proteins . PURPOSE : The bone morphogenic protein ( BMP ) antagonist gremlin is elevated in glaucomatous trabecular meshwork ( TM ) cells and tissues and elevates intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Gremlin also blocks P12644 inhibition of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β2 induction of TM extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) proteins . The purpose of this study was to determine whether Gremlin regulates Q13201 proteins in cultured human TM cells . METHODS : Human TM cells were treated with recombinant gremlin to determine the effects on Q13201 gene and protein expression . Expression of the Q13201 genes FN , COL1 , P05121 , and P15502 was examined in cultured human TM cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western immunoblot analysis . TM cells were pretreated with TGFBR inhibitors ( LY364947 , SB431542 or P36897 / P61812 siRNAs ) , inhibitors of the Smad signaling pathway ( SIS3 or Q15796 /3/4 siRNAs ) , or P29279 siRNA to identify the signaling pathway(s) involved in gremlin induction of Q13201 gene and protein expression . RESULTS : All Q13201 genes analyzed ( FN , COL1 , P05121 , and P15502 ) were induced by gremlin . This gremlin induction of Q13201 genes and protein expression was blocked by inhibitors of TGFBR and the canonical Q15796 /3/4 and P29279 signaling pathways . CONCLUSIONS : Gremlin employs canonical TGFβ2/Smad signaling to induce Q13201 genes and proteins in cultured human TM cells . Gremlin also induces both TGFβ2 and P29279 , which can act downstream to mediate some of these Q13201 changes in TM cells .
