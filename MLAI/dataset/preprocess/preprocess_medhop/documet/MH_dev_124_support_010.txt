The genes of the coactivator Q15596 and the corepressor Q9Y618 are primary DB00136 targets . The complex of the receptor for the hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) ) , Vitamin D(3) receptor ( P11473 ) , the retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and a 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) response element ( VDRE ) is considered to be the molecular switch for nuclear 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) signaling . In the presence of ligand the P11473 -RXR complex interacts with coactivator ( DB01992 ) proteins that in turn contact components of the basal transcriptional machinery resulting in an enhanced transcription of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) target genes . In the absence of ligand the P11473 remains bound to the DNA and interacts with corepressor ( CoR ) proteins that are involved in gene silencing activity . We treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) for increasing amounts of time , extracted mRNA and screened by real-time PCR the members of the P52701 DB01992 and NCoR CoR families . We find that of the P52701 coactivators , only Q15596 was responsive to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) . Similarly Q9Y618 but not NCoR1 gene transcription was sensitive to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment . In silico analysis revealed that both Q15596 and Q9Y618 promoters have substantial numbers of VDREs compared to the promoters of the other family members . These VDREs are formed by direct repeats of the core binding motif RGKTCA with a three nucleotide spacing ( Q93038 ) . We suggest that some or all of these Q93038 -type VDREs are responsible for the observed responsiveness of Q15596 and Q9Y618 to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) .
