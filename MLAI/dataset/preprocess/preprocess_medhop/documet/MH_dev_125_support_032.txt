DB01076 inhibits RhoC function and limits head and neck cancer metastasis . OBJECTIVE : RhoC oncogene is a well characterized marker of metastasis in a majority of invasive cancers , including HNSCC . Elevated RhoC expression has been found to be associated with distant metastasis . Statins are a class of drugs that are used to reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting P04035 activity which in turns prevents mevalonate synthesis , which is a precursor for synthesis of cholesterol and prenylation . Interestingly , the proper function of Rho proteins depends on prenylation . Significantly , it has been reported that metastasis in human melanoma can be reduced by atorvastatin which inhibits RhoC activity by preventing its geranylgeranylation . Given that RhoC is a key oncogene involved in metastasis , we hypothesized DB01076 can reduce head and neck metastasis by inhibiting RhoC activity . METHODS : In vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the ability of DB01076 to inhibit RhoC function and HNSCC metastasis . Cell motility , proliferation , cell invasion , and colony formation assays were performed according to the standard protocols . RESULTS : DB01076 treatment significantly reduced the active form of RhoC in vitro and diminished cell motility , invasion , proliferation and colony formation . Importantly , we observed a significant decrease in p- P27361 /2 and p- P40763 in DB01076 treated cell lines . In vivo experiments revealed inhibition of angiogenesis and lung metastases with DB01076 therapy . CONCLUSIONS : This study is the first of its kind to establish a potential role of DB01076 in head and neck cancer therapy . These findings suggest that DB01076 can be a potential low risk adjuvant therapy to minimize metastases in aggressive forms of HNSCC .
