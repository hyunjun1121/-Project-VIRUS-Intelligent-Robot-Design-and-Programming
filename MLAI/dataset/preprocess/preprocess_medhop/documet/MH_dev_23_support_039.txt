DB01169 induces cardiac fibroblast apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by up-regulating TGF-β1 expression . DB01169 ( As2O3 ; ATO ) is clinically effective in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; however , it frequently causes cardiotoxic effects . This study was designed to investigate whether ATO could induce apoptosis of cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) that play very important roles in maintaining the structure integrity and function of the heart . Cardiac fibroblasts from guinea pigs administered with ATO ( 1mg/kgbw ) were used to test the pro-apoptotic role of ATO in vivo . The current study demonstrated that ATO induced morphological characteristics of apoptosis and P42574 activation in CFs of guinea pigs along with a significant up-regulation in TGF-β1 protein expression , Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and P27361 /2 phosphorylation . In vitro MTT assay showed that ATO remarkably reduced the viability of cultured cardiac fibroblasts ( NRCFs ) from neonatal rat in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . Consistent with the notions in vivo , ATO significantly induced the apoptosis in NRCFs , dramatically up-regulated TGF-β1 protein level and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in a time-dependent fashion and activated P42574 and P27361 /2 . Finally , pretreatment with LY364947 , an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling could apparently reverse these changes . We therefore conclude that TGF-β is functionally linked to P27361 /2 and that TGF-β signaling is responsible for ATO-induced CFs apoptosis , which provides a novel mechanism of ATO related cardiac toxicology .
