Efficacy and safety of repeated dosing of netupitant , a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist , in treating overactive bladder . AIM : NK-1 receptors in sensory nerves , the spinal cord and bladder smooth muscle participate in complex sensory mechanisms that regulate bladder activity . This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a new P25103 antagonist , netupitant , in patients with OAB . METHODS : This was a phase II , multicenter , double-blind study in which adults with OAB symptoms > 6 months were randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of netupitant ( 50 , 100 , 200 mg ) or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in average number of daily micturitions at week 8 . Urinary incontinence , urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , and urgency episodes were also assessed . RESULTS : The primary efficacy endpoint was similar in the treatment groups ( -13.85 for placebo to -16.17 in the netupitant 200 mg group ) with no statistically significant differences between netupitant and placebo . The same was true for most secondary endpoints although a significant difference for improvement in UUI episodes and a trend for the greatest decrease in urgency episodes were seen in the netupitant 100 mg group . DB09048 was well tolerated with most treatment emergent adverse events ( AEs ) being mild . While the overall incidence of AEs increased with netupitant dose , there was no evidence for this dose dependency based on relationship to treatment , intensity , or time to onset . CONCLUSIONS : The study failed to demonstrate superiority of netupitant versus placebo in decreasing OAB symptoms , despite a trend favoring netupitant 100 mg . There were no safety concerns with daily administration of netupitant over 8 weeks .
