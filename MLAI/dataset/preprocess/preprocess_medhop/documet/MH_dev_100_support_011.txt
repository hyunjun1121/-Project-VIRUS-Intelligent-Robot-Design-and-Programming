Role of breast regression protein-39 in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and emphysema . The exaggerated expression of chitinase-like protein P36222 , the human homologue of breast regression protein-39 ( BRP-39 ) , was reported in a number of diseases , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) . However , the in vivo roles of P36222 in normal physiology or in the pathogenesis of specific diseases such as P48444 remain poorly understood . We hypothesized that BRP-39/ P36222 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke ( CS ) -induced emphysema . To test this hypothesis , 10-week-old wild-type and BRP-39 null mutant mice ( BRP-39(-/-) ) were exposed to room air ( RA ) and CS for up to 10 months . The expression of BRP-39 was significantly induced in macrophages , airway epithelial cells , and alveolar Type II cells in the lungs of CS-exposed mice compared with RA-exposed mice , at least in part via an Q14116 signaling-dependent pathway . The null mutation of BRP-39 significantly reduced CS-induced bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue inflammation . However , CS-induced epithelial cell apoptosis and alveolar destruction were further enhanced in the absence of BRP-39 . Consistent with these findings in mice , the tissue expression of P36222 was significantly increased in the lungs of current smokers compared with the lungs of ex-smokers or nonsmokers . In addition , serum concentrations of P36222 were significantly higher in smokers with P48444 than in nonsmokers or smokers without P48444 . These studies demonstrate a novel regulatory role of BRP-39/ P36222 in CS-induced inflammation and emphysematous destruction . These studies also underscore that maintaining physiologic concentrations of P36222 in the lung is therapeutically important in preventing excessive inflammatory responses or emphysematous alveolar destruction .
