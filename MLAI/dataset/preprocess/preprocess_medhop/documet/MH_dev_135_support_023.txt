P40763 regulates proliferation and survival of CD8+ T cells : enhances effector responses to HSV-1 infection , and inhibits P22301 + regulatory CD8+ T cells in autoimmune uveitis . P40763 regulates P01730 + T cell survival and differentiation . However , its effects on CD8+ T cells are not well understood . Here , we show that in comparison to WT CD8+ T cells , P40763 -deficient CD8+ T cells exhibit a preactivated memory-like phenotype , produce more P60568 , proliferate faster , and are more sensitive to activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) . The enhanced proliferation and sensitivity to AICD correlated with downregulation of class-O forkhead transcription factors ( FoxO1 , FoxO3A ) , P38936 (waf1) , p27( P46527 ) , Bcl-2 , OX-40 , and upregulation of P48023 , Bax , and Bad . We examined whether P40763 -deficient CD8+ T cells can mount effective response during herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) infection and experimental autoimmune uveitis ( EAU ) . Compared to WT mice , HSV-1-infected P40763 -deficient mice ( STAT3KO ) produced less IFN-Î³ and virus-specific KLRG-1+ CD8+ T cells . STAT3KO mice are also resistant to EAU and produced less Q16552 -producing Tc17 cells . Resistance of STAT3KO to EAU correlated with marked expansion of P22301 -producing regulatory CD8+ T cells ( CD8-Treg ) implicated in recovery from autoimmune encephalomyelitis . Thus , increases of P05231 -induced P40763 activation observed during inflammation may inhibit expansion of CD8-Tregs , thereby impeding recovery from uveitis . These results suggest that P40763 is a potential therapeutic target for upregulating CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to viruses and suggest the successful therapeutic targeting of P40763 as treatment for uveitis , derived , in part , from promoting CD8-Treg expansion .
