Inhibition of activated receptor tyrosine kinases by DB01268 induces growth arrest and sensitizes melanoma cells to DB00188 by blocking Akt pathway . Despite the use of multiple therapeutic strategies , metastatic melanoma remains a challenge for oncologists . Thus , new approaches using combinational treatment may be used to try to improve the prognosis of this disease . In this report , we have analyzed the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) in melanoma specimens and in four metastatic melanoma cell lines . Both melanoma specimens and cell lines expressed RTKs , suggesting that they may represent eventual targets for multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor , Suntinib . DB01268 reduced the proliferation of two melanoma cell lines ( M16 and M17 ) and increased apoptosis in one of them ( M16 ) . Moreover , the two metastatic melanoma cell lines harbored an activated receptor ( PDGFRα and VEGFR , respectively ) , and DB01268 suppressed the phosphorylation of the RTKs and their downstream targets Akt and ribosomal protein S6 , in these two cell lines . Similar results were obtained when either PDGFRα or P35968 expression was silenced by lentiviral-mediated short-hairpin RNA delivery in M16 and M17 , respectively . To evaluate the interaction between DB01268 and DB00188 , median dose effect analysis using MTT assay was performed , and combination index was calculated . DB00188 synergistically enhanced the DB01268 -induced growth arrest in DB01268 -sensitive cells ( combination index < 1 ) . Moreover , LY294002 , a PI3K inhibitor , sensitized melanoma cells to DB00188 treatment , suggesting that downregulation of phospho-Akt by DB01268 mediates the synergy obtained by DB00188 + DB01268 cotreatment . Altogether , our results suggest that melanoma cells harboring an activated RTK may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic RTK inhibition by DB01268 , and a strategy combining DB01268 and DB00188 , may provide therapeutic benefit .
