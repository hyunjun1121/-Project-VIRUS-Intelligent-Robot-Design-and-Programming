Effects of vitamin A deficiency and repletion on rat glucagon secretion . To determine whether vitamin A is involved in pancreatic alpha cell function , we tested for ( a ) effects of vitamin A deficiency on glucagon release from perifused islets and perfused pancreases , and ( b ) the presence of cytosolic retinol-binding proteins ( P09455 ) and retinoic acid-binding proteins ( CRABP ) , in the glucagon-secreting alpha cell line , ln- Q96GN5 -G9 . DB00125 19 mM plus glucose 2.8 mM-stimulated glucagon secretion was markedly impaired in islets and pancreases of vitamin A-deficient rats or rats that had at some time been cycled through vitamin A deficiency ( ever A-def ) despite repletion with retinoids for 2-4 weeks . P01308 secretion was impaired likewise . Repletion starting early in the development of vitamin A deficiency and for a longer period of time ( 18 or 60 days ) did not restore glucagon secretion , but did normalize insulin secretion . P09455 and CRABP were present in ln- Q96GN5 -G9 cells . We conclude that ( a ) vitamin A deficiency is associated with a defect in glucagon secretion ; ( b ) The defect in secretion occurs early in the course of vitamin A deficiency ; ( c ) The defect persists despite repletion ; and ( d ) The requirement of vitamin A for secretion and the presence of P09455 and CRABP in glucagon-secreting cells support a physiologic role for vitamin A at the alpha cell level .
