Autoantibodies against four kinds of neurotransmitter receptors in psychiatric disorders . There is a hypothesis that autoimmune abnormalities in neurotransmitter receptors might cause some psychiatric disorders . Using a sensitive radioligand assay , we detected serum autoantibodies to recombinant human muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 ( P11229 , 34.4 % ) , mu-opioid receptor ( P35372 , 13.1 % ) , P08908 ( P08908 , 7.4 % ) , and dopamine receptor D2 ( P14416 , 4.9 % ) in 122 psychiatric patients . Positive antibodies to P11229 were found in 34.1 % , 34.9 % , 33.3 % , and 9.1 % of patients with schizophrenic disorders ( n=44 ) , mood disorders ( n=63 ) , other psychiatric disorders ( n=15 ) and autoimmune diseases ( n=33 ) , respectively . All three patients with neuroleptic maliganant syndrome had high activities of autoantibodies to P11229 , P35372 , and/or P08908 . Our data suggest that autoimmunity to neurotransmitter receptors might be associated with the induction of psychiatric symptoms and have some relation to neuroleptic malignant syndrome .
