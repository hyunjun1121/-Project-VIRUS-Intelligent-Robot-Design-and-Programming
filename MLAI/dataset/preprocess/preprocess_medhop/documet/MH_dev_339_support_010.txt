Inspiratory fraction correlates with exercise capacity in patients with stable moderate to severe P48444 . BACKGROUND : Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of P48444 . Static lung hyperinflation and increased dynamic hyperinflation during exercise are associated with reduced functional capacity in P48444 patients . Inspiratory capacity correction for the total lung capacity , defined as inspiratory fraction ( IF ) , may be functionally more representative than other traditional indices in these patients . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association between IF and exercise capacity in patients with stable , moderate to severe P48444 . METHODS : Fifty P48444 subjects and 34 healthy volunteers constituted the study cohort . Pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were performed , and ventilation and gas exchange parameters were measured . RESULTS : IF was significantly correlated with percent-of-predicted peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) in the subjects with P48444 ( r = 0.52 , P < .001 ) . IF was an independent predictor of reduced exercise capacity in the P48444 subjects , and was more sensitive and specific than percent-of-predicted FEV1 . Statistical analysis generated the equation : percent-of-predicted peak VO2 = 65.9 IF + 0.45 percent-of-predicted FEV1 + 35.8 ( R( P06681 ) = 0.39 , P < .001 ) . The subjects with IF < 0.23 had more severe lung hyperinflation and less exercise capacity than the subjects with IF > 0.23 . At peak exercise , the breathing frequencies of the 2 groups were similar , whereas the low-IF subjects had reduced peak minute ventilation and peak tidal volume , relative to the high-IF subjects . CONCLUSIONS : Compared to FEV1 , IF is a robust factor to reflect lung hyperinflation and to estimate the exercise capacity of subjects with stable moderate to severe P48444 .
