Lipoteichoic acid induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression via transactivation of PDGF receptors and NF-kappaB activation in rat brain astrocytes . Bacterial infections have been shown to be involved in several inflammatory diseases such as brain inflammation . A major factor for these findings is due to the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators by host cells triggered by the components released from the bacteria . Among these components , lipoteichoic acid ( P01374 ) , a component of Gram-positive bacterial cell wall , has been found to be elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from meningitis . Moreover , increased plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , in particular P14780 , have been observed in patients with brain inflammatory diseases and may contribute to disease pathology . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying P01374 -induced P14780 expression in rat brain astrocytes ( RBA-1 cells ) remain poorly defined . Here , the data with zymographic , Western blotting , RT-PCR , and immunofluorescent staining analyses showed that P01374 induced P14780 expression and activation via a O60603 -activated c-Src-dependent transactivation of P09619 pathway . Transactivation of P09619 led to activation of PI3K/Akt and Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK and then activated the IKK/NF-kappaB cascade . The activated-NF-kappaB translocated into nucleus which bound to kappaB-binding site of P14780 promoter , and thereby turned on transcription of P14780 . Eventually , upregulation of P14780 by P01374 enhanced cell migration of astrocytes . Taken together , these results suggested that in RBA-1 cells , activation of NF-kappaB by a c-Src-dependent PI3K/Akt- Q8NFH3 / Q8TCB0 MAPK activation mediated through transactivation of P09619 is essential for P14780 gene upregulation induced by P01374 . Understanding the regulation of P14780 expression and functional changes by P01374 /TLR system on astrocytes may provide potential therapeutic targets of Gram-positive bacterial infection in brain disorders .
