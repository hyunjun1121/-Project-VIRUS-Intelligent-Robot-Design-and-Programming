Genetic progress towards the molecular basis of autoimmunity . The past few years have seen the identification of Q9Y2R2 and the confirmation of P16410 as common autoimmune disease genes . Together with MHC and P01308 , these developments have increased the collection of confirmed susceptibility loci for autoimmunity . In this article , the latest developments related to these genes and to other recently studied candidate autoimmune susceptibility loci ( Q15116 , Q96P31 , Q6EEV6 , CD25 , Q9UM07 and Q9H015 ) are reviewed . Collectively , these genes strongly indicate that aberrant inhibition of the signalling cascade initiated by activation of the T-cell receptor is involved in the aetiology of autoimmune disease . However , much basic genetic , molecular and clinical research is still needed to help us fully understand the underlying mechanisms of autoimmunity and how these translate into prognosis or therapy .
