Pharmacological therapy for acromegaly : a critical review . The treatment of acromegaly has changed considerably over the last few decades . In the late 1970s , the introduction of the dopamine receptor agonists made it possible to reduce growth hormone ( GH ) secretion by somatotropinomas for the first time . Thereafter , the introduction of the somatostatin analogues in the early 1980s had major implications . Recently , the first data on the use of genetically engineered human P10912 ( P10912 ) antagonists that block GH actions have become available . These P10912 antagonists reduce both the biochemical abnormalities of acromegaly , as well as improve clinical signs and symptomatology . In this article we firstly review available data on dopamine agonists . Currently these compounds should be considered in patients with a mixed GH-prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma and/or those in whom pre-treatment insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I concentrations are below 750 microg/L . We then discuss the somatostatin analogues . These compounds are capable of achieving biochemical control of GH and P05019 in 50-60 % of patients and tumour shrinkage in some 30 % . In particular , candidates for treatment with these compounds are those patients who have undergone an unsuccessful transsphenoidal operation or who await the therapeutic effect of external pituitary irradiation . In selected patients primary medical therapy with somatostatin analogues is certainly a feasible option . To date , pegvisomant is the only available member of a new class of drugs that was especially designed to block the P10912 . DB00082 is the most effective treatment for normalising P05019 concentrations and appears to have a good safety profile . However , liver function tests should be regularly monitored and tumour size should be closely followed . Finally , we propose a treatment algorithm for acromegaly .
