Cortagine infused into the medial prefrontal cortex attenuates predator-induced defensive behaviors and Fos protein production in selective nuclei of the amygdala in male CD1 mice . P06850 ( CRF ) plays an essential role in coordinating the autonomic , endocrine and behavioral responses to stressors . In this study , we investigated the role of CRF within the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) in modulating unconditioned defensive behaviors , by examining the effects of microinfusing cortagine a selective type-1 CRF receptor ( CRF1 ) agonist , or acidic-astressin a preferential CRF1 antagonist , into the mPFC in male CD-1 mice exposed to a live predator ( rat exposure test -- P07949 ) . Cortagine microinfusions significantly reduced several indices of defense , including avoidance and freezing , suggesting a specific role for CRF1 within the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the mPFC in modulating unconditioned behavioral responsivity to a predator . In contrast , microinfusions of acidic-astressin failed to alter defensive behaviors during predator exposure in the P07949 . Cortagine microinfusions also reduced Fos protein production in the medial , central and basomedial , but not basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala in mice exposed to the rat predatory threat stimulus . These results suggest that CRF1 activation within the mPFC attenuates predator-induced unconditioned anxiety-like defensive behaviors , likely via inhibition of specific amygdalar nuclei . Furthermore , the present findings suggest that the mPFC represents a unique neural region whereby activation of CRF1 produces behavioral effects that contrast with those elicited following systemic administration of CRF1 agonists .
