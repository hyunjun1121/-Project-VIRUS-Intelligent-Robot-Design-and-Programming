SERCA2b activity is regulated by cyclophilins in human platelets . OBJECTIVE : The role of cyclophilins ( chaperones that are widely expressed in different cell types , including human platelets ) was explored in sarcoendoplasmic calcium ( Ca(2+) ) adenosine triphosphatase ( SERCA ) activity . METHODS AND RESULTS : Cyclophilin inhibition by cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) evoked a time- and concentration-dependent reduction of Ca(2+) uptake by SERCA2b . However , other Ca(2+)-adenosine triphosphatases expressed in platelets , such as Q93084 and plasma membrane Ca(2+) adenosine triphophatase , remained unaltered after DB00091 treatment . Cypermethrin , a non- DB00091 -related calcineurin inhibitor , did not alter SERCA2b activity . Furthermore , SERCA2b was affected by other DB00091 analogues , which do not interfere with calcineurin , such as PKF-211-811-NX5 ( NIM811 ) and sanglifehrin A . Inhibition of the immunophilin family members using FK506 ( tacrolimus ) did not alter SERCA2b ability to sequester Ca(2+) into the dense tubular system . Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that cyclophilin A associates with SERCA2b and stromal interaction molecule-1 in resting platelets . This interaction is attenuated by the physiological agonist thrombin but enhanced by treatment with DB00091 or sanglifehrin A . CONCLUSIONS : P62937 is a regulator of SERCA2b in human platelets .
