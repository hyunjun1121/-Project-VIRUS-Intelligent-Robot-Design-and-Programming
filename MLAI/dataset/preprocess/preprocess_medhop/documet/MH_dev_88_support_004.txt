DB00082 treatment in a 4-year-old girl with neurofibromatosis type 1 . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Growth hormone ( GH ) excess in childhood is a rare disorder . Current treatment options such as somatostatin analogues , pituitary surgery or irradiation can have serious side effects . Recently , a P10912 antagonist , pegvisomant , was introduced for the treatment of adults with acromegaly . We wanted to investigate whether pegvisomant was effective in a child with octreotide-resistant GH excess . CASE : A 4-year-old girl with neurofibromatosis type 1 and GH excess associated with optic glioma received pegvisomant injections ( 10 mg subcutaneously ) with increasing intervals from daily to every 4th day . RESULTS : P05019 and P17936 decreased from +6.9 and 4.6 standard deviation scores ( SDS ) , respectively , to within normal range . Height velocity dropped from 12.4 SDS to mean -0.7 SDS ( range : -5.0 to 5.0 ) and height SDS decreased from +1.3 to +0.6 ( target height : +0.2 ) . Random non-fasting serum GH values were mean 5.0 mlU/l ( range : 1.6-9.5 ) . There was no change in fasting blood glucose ( 4.6-4.7 mmol/l ) or glycosylated haemoglobin ( 5.5 % ) and no subjective or biochemical side effects . Repeated tests of thyroid , adrenal and gonadal function showed no alterations during the treatment period . Intracranial tumours remained unchanged in size and visual impairment did not deteriorate . CONCLUSION : DB00082 normalized P05019 and P17936 levels . Growth velocity was normalized after initial catch-down growth , and it remains to be seen whether this result can be maintained during long-term treatment .
