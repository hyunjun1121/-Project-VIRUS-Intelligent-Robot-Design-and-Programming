Passive smoke effects on cough and airways in young guinea pigs : role of brainstem DB05875 . Children raised with extended exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) experience increased cough and wheeze . This study was designed to determine whether extended ETS exposure enhances citric acid-induced cough and bronchoconstriction in young guinea pigs via a neurokinin-1 ( NK-1 ) receptor mechanism at the first central synapse of lung afferent neurons , the nucleus tractus solitarius . Guinea pigs were exposed to ETS from 1 to 6 weeks of age . At 5 weeks of age , guide cannulae were implanted bilaterally in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius at a site that produced apnea in response to the glutamate agonist D,L-homocysteic acid . At 6 weeks of age , either vehicle or a P25103 antagonist , DB05790 , was injected into the nucleus tractus solitarius of the conscious guinea pigs who were then exposed to citric acid aerosol . ETS exposure significantly enhanced citric acid-induced cough by 56 % and maximal Penh ( a measure of airway obstruction ) by 43 % , effects that were attenuated by the P25103 antagonist in the nucleus tractus solitarius . We conclude that in young guinea pigs extended exposure to ETS increases citric acid-induced cough and bronchoconstriction in part by an P25103 mechanism in the nucleus tractus solitarius .
