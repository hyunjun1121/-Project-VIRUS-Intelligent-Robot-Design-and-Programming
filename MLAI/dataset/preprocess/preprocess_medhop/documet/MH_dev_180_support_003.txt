DB00114 values in cerebrospinal fluid : reference values and diagnosis of Q9NVS9 deficiency in paediatric patients . Our aim was to establish reference values for cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( PLP ) in a paediatric population for the diagnosis of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase ( Q9NVS9 ) deficiency . For reference values , P04141 samples from 113 paediatric controls ( age range : 1 day-18 years ) from Barcelona and London were analysed . Cerebrospinal fluid PLP and biogenic amine concentrations were analysed by HPLC with fluorescence and electrochemical detection . DB00114 concentrations in 4 patients with Q9NVS9 deficiency were determined . A negative correlation between P04141 PLP values and age of controls was observed in both populations ( r=-0.503 ; p < 0.0001 and r=-0.542 ; p=0.002 ) . Reference values were stratified into 4 ( Barcelona ) and 3 age groups ( London ) . For the newborn period , P04141 PLP reference intervals were 32-78 and 44-89 nmol/L for the Barcelona and London centers , respectively ) . No correlation was observed in the different age groups between PLP values and biogenic amines metabolites . PLP values in neonates with Q9NVS9 deficiency were clearly decreased ( PLP=3.6 , 12.0 , 14.0 and 18.0 nmol/L ) compared with our reference ranges . In conclusion , reference values for P04141 PLP should be stratified according to age . No association was observed between PLP values and biogenic amines metabolites . In our 4 cases with Q9NVS9 deficiency , P04141 PLP values were clearly below the reference values .
