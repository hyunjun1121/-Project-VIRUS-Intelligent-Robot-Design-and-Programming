Evidence for interaction of human anti-idiotypic antibodies with CA 125 determination in a patient after radioimmunodetection . Very high concentrations of CA 125 have been found in some ovarian cancer patients after repeated radioimmunodetection with anti-CA 125 antibodies [ OC125-F(ab')2 ] . In one patient we measured a CA 125 concentration of 135,000 kilo-arb . units/L , using an enzyme immunoassay involving OC125 antibodies . With an immunoradiometric assay involving use of two new anti-CA 125 antibodies ( DB04964 and Q8TCY5 .1 ) , the CA 125 concentration was 34 kilo-arb . units/L , indicating a discrepancy . The component responsible for the high result in the enzyme immunoassay could be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose . Furthermore this component bound to anti-human IgG-Sepharose in the same manner as did the serum IgG fraction . Adsorption of human anti-mouse antibodies present in the serum did not decrease the Q8WXI7 -like material . Binding of whole OC125 antibodies to the purified Q8WXI7 -like material was inhibited completely in the presence of CA 125 antigen . We infer that the false-positive CA 125 activity is ascribable to a human IgG directed against an idiotope of the OC125 antibody , which was induced by repeated application of OC125 antibodies . To avoid falsely positive results in patients receiving OC125 antibodies , CA 125 should be measured by an assay in which other antibodies are used .
