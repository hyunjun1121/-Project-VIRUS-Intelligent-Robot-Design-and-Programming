Coadministrating luteolin minimizes the side effects of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole . P11511 inhibitors ( AIs ) have been used as adjuvant therapeutic agents for breast cancer . Their adverse side effect on blood lipid is well documented . Some natural compounds have been shown to be potential AIs . In the present study , we compared the efficacy of the flavonoid luteolin to the clinically approved AI letrozole ( DB01006 ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals , East Hanover , NJ ) in a cell and a mouse model . In the in vitro experimental results for aromatase inhibition , the Ki values of luteolin and letrozole were estimated to be 2.44 ÂµM and 0.41 nM , respectively . Both letrozole and luteolin appeared to be competitive inhibitors . Subsequently , an animal model was used for the comparison . P11511 -expressing MCF-7 cells were transplanted into ovariectomized athymic mice . Luteolin was given by mouth at 5 , 20 , and 50 mg/kg , whereas letrozole was administered by intravenous injection . Similar to letrozole , luteolin administration reduced plasma estrogen concentrations and suppressed the xenograft proliferation . The regulation of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins-such as a decrease in the expression of Bcl-xL , cyclin-A/D1/E , P24941 /4 , and increase in that of Bax-was about the same in both treatments . The most significant disparity was on blood lipids . In contrast to letrozole , luteolin increased fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations and produced a desirable blood lipid profile . These results suggested that the flavonoid could be a coadjuvant therapeutic agent without impairing the action of AIs .
