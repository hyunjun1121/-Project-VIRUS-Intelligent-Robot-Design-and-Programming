P18509 , interleukin-6 and glucocorticoids regulate the release of vascular endothelial growth factor in pituitary folliculostellate cells . There is increasing evidence that hormones play an important role in the control of endothelial cell function and growth by regulating the production of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) . P15692 regulates vascular permeability and represents the most powerful growth factor for endothelial cells . In the normal anterior pituitary , P15692 has been detected only in folliculostellate ( FS ) cells . In the present study , the regulation of the release of P15692 from FS-like mouse TtT/GF cells , and from FS cells of rat pituitary monolayer cell cultures was investigated using a specific P15692 ELISA . Basal release of P15692 was demonstrated in cultures of both TtT/GF cells and rat pituitary cells . Interestingly , the P15692 secretion was stimulated by both forms of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 ) , indicating that this hypothalamic peptide regulates endothelial cell function and growth within the pituitary . P15692 secretion was also stimulated by interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) whereas basal , P05231 - and PACAP-stimulated secretion was inhibited by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone . The inhibitory action of dexamethasone was reversed by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist DB00834 , suggesting that in FS cells functional glucocorticoid receptors mediate the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on the P15692 secretion . The endocrine and auto-/paracrine control of P15692 production in pituitary FS cells by PACAP , P05231 and glucocorticoids may play an important role both in angiogenesis and vascular permeability regulation within the pituitary under physiological and pathophysiological conditions .
