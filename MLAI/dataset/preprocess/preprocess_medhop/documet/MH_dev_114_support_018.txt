Genome-wide microarray-based analysis of miRNAs expression in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure . BACKGROUND : Acute-on-chronic liver failure ( ACLF ) is a severe clinical syndrome that may cause a high mortality . However , the mechanism is still not clear . Characterization of the microRNA ( miRNA ) profiles in ACLF patients may provide new clues to the pathogenesis and management of this syndrome . METHODS : Genome-wide microarray was performed to compare the different miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a pair of monozygotic twins , an ACLF patient and an HBV asymptomatic carrier ( AsC ) . The case-control miRNA profiles were compared and confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 104 ACLF patients and 96 AsCs . A combined computational prediction algorithm was used to predict the potential target genes . RESULTS : Forty-five miRNAs were increased and eight miRNAs were decreased in the ACLF group . The expressions of hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16 were increased by 8.58- and 8.63-fold in ACLF patients compared with that in AsCs , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) . Q9Y2G2 , P10415 , Q9NZN1 , Q06643 , Q9ULW2 and Q92838 were identified as the target genes of hsa-miR-16 ; Q8IVH8 , P35372 , Q9NZI8 and Q5T4B2 were verified as the target genes of hsa-let-7a . CONCLUSIONS : Our results showed that there is a close relationship between specific miRNAs of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and ACLF. hsa-miR-16 and hsa-let-7a may contribute to the development of ACLF .
