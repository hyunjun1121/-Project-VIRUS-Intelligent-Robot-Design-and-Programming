Mitogenic signaling of urokinase receptor-deficient kidney fibroblasts : actions of an alternative urokinase receptor and P01130 -related protein . The urokinase receptor ( Q03405 ) attenuates myofibroblast recruitment and fibrosis in the kidney . This study examined the role of Q03405 and its co-receptor P01130 -related protein ( Q14764 ) in the regulation of kidney fibroblast proliferation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) signaling . Compared with Q03405 +/+ cells , Q03405 -/- kidney fibroblasts were hyperproliferative . Q03405 -/- fibroblast proliferation was 60 % inhibited by an P29323 kinase inhibitor . Q14764 protein was reduced and extracellular accumulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) proteins were greater in Q03405 -/- cultures . Addition of functional uPA protein or Q14764 antisense RNA significantly increased P29323 signaling and cell mitosis in both genotypes . Enhanced Q03405 -/- fibroblast proliferation was reversed by a recombinant nonfunctional uPA peptide . The density of cell-bound fluor-uPA was similar between Q03405 -/- and Q03405 +/+ fibroblasts ( 78 +/- 6 versus 92 +/- 16 units ) . These data suggest that Q03405 -deficient kidney fibroblasts express lower levels of its scavenger co-receptor Q14764 , resulting in greater extracellular accumulation of uPA and P05121 . Enhanced proliferation of Q03405 -/- fibroblasts seems to be mediated by uPA-dependent P29323 signaling via an alternative urokinase receptor .
