[ Exploration of exercise intolerance by 31P NMR spectroscopy of calf muscles coupled with Q9BWK5 and ergometry ] . One hundred patients presenting with exercise intolerance or rhabdomyolysis episodes have been examined successively by 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( P59665 ) of leg plantar flexor muscles with exercise test . In all cases a muscle biopsy was performed . At the end of investigations , diagnosis of a metabolic myopathy was made in 33 patients : glycogenolysis or glycolysis deficiency in 8 cases , mitochondrial myopathy in 24 cases and P23786 deficiency in one case . Muscular dystrophy or congenital myopathy were diagnosed in 6 cases . No precise etiology could be found in 30 patients with either high CK levels or muscle biopsy abnormalities . Seven patients had rhabdomyolysis related to excessive physical activities . Twenty-four patients had functional symptoms . The principal P59665 parameters used for diagnosis were the values of intracellular pH at the end of exercise and the time constant of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery . Lack of acidosis after exercise was observed in all patients with blockade of glycogenolysis or glycolysis . A slowing in phosphocreatine resynthesis was found in 66 p.cent of patients with definite mitochondrial myopathy . The specificity of these parameters were respectively 92.4 p.cent and 85.5 p.cent for the two groups . In conclusion (31)P P59665 allows the detection of muscular glycogenoses with a sensitivity close to 100 p.cent . However , its sensitivity was lower for the detection of mitochondrial myopathies , as is also known for the other in vivo metabolic investigations , reflecting the heterogeneity of expression of mitochondrial abnormalities in a given muscle . The integration of imaging in the examination protocol may help to orientate towards the diagnostic of a dystrophy in some patients .
