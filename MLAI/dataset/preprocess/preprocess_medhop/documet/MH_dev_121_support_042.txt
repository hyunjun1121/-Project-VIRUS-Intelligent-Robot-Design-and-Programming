A field synopsis and meta-analysis of genetic association studies in peripheral arterial disease : The CUMAGAS-PAD database . In an electronic search of the literature , the authors systematically retrieved all published studies that investigated genetic susceptibility to peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . They created a comprehensive database of all eligible studies , collecting detailed genetic and bioinformatics data on each polymorphism . Data from eligible studies were synthesized using meta-analysis techniques . Gene variants were classified into distinct pathophysiologic pathways , and their potential involvement in PAD pathogenesis was determined . Forty-one publications that examined 44 gene polymorphisms were included . For 37 polymorphisms , the variant form had a functional effect . Twenty-three polymorphisms in 22 potential PAD candidate genes ( F2 , P02675 , P42898 , P05106 , P12821 , AGT , P05231 , P13500 , P05362 , P16581 , P14780 , P37231 , P03956 , P35611 , Q9H244 , P11150 , Q13093 , Q8WTV0 , P08254 , P55157 , P08519 , P32297 ) showed a significant association in individual studies . Eighty-eight percent of the studies had statistical power of less than 50 % , and in 15 studies the genotype distribution in the control group did not conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium . Data on 12 polymorphisms ( P12259 1691 G/A , P42898 677C/T , F2 20210 G/A , P05106 1565 T/C , P12821 I/D , AGT 704C/T , AGT -6G/A , AGT 733C/T , P05231 -174 G/C , P14780 -1562C/T , P05362 1462A/G , P32297 831C/T ) were synthesized , and a positive association was found for 3 ( P05231 -174 G/C , P05362 1462A/G , P32297 831C/T ) .
