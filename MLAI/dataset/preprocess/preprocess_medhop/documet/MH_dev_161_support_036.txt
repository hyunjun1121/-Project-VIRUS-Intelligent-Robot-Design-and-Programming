DB00188 prevents the expression of P45452 and the degradation of collagen type 2 in human chondrocytes . The structural backbone of extracellular matrix in cartilage is the collagen fibril , which is mainly composed of type II collagen . A measurable increase in type II collagen denaturation and degradation has been found in early Osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Pro-inflammatory cytokine such as P01375 -α produced in OA cartilage induced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 ( P45452 ) , which targets and degrades type II collagen . DB00188 is a proteasome inhibitor approved by the FDA for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantel cell lymphoma . The effects of bortezomib in OA have not been reported before . In this study , we found that bortezomib is able to suppress the degradation of type II collagen induced by P01375 -α in human chondrocytes . Mechanistically , bortezomib treatment inhibits the expression of P10914 through blunting O60674 / P42224 pathway , thereby prevents the induction of P45452 as well as the degradation of type II collagen . Our findings suggest the therapeutic potentials of bortezomib in patients with OA .
