Molecular markers of programmed cell death in donor hearts before transplantation . BACKGROUND : In this study we investigate whether pro-apoptotic , pro-inflammatory and other early signaling markers indicative of increased propensity for cell death processes were evident in human donor heart allografts immediately before transplantation , and whether there is an association with primary graft failure . METHODS : A prospective study was performed utilizing donor left atrial myocardium collected at the time of implantation of hearts from brain-dead donors ( BDD , n = 29 ) . In addition , to explore the potential of donor hearts from donation after circulatory death ( P81605 ) , myocardial samples were obtained during transplantation of lungs from P81605 donors ( n = 6 ) . A comparator reference group ( n = 7 ) consisted of left atrial specimens from patients undergoing mitral valve surgery . RESULTS : Significantly raised levels of caspase-3 specific activity , activated hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1α ) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were evident in the transplanted hearts ( from BDD ) that developed primary graft failure ( n = 11 ) . P81605 hearts did not differ from BDD with regard to mRNA expression levels of FAS , Bax , P05231 and caspase-3 . Although P81605 hearts exhibited lower caspase-3 specific activity and activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 protein , they had higher levels of mRNA for NF-κB , Bnip3 and caspase-1 mRNA . Increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels reflected greater oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species-related DNA fragmentation . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate a significant role of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory activity in allografts that subsequently exhibit primary graft failure . The relatively lower levels of apoptotic and inflammatory activity in P81605 hearts suggest they may represent a potentially usable donor cardiac allograft pool . This possibility requires further detailed molecular and clinical research .
