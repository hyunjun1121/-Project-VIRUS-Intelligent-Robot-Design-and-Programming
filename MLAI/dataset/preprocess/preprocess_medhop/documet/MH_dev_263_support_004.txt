DB02709 is a peroxidase-mediated inactivator of P23219 but not P35354 : a mechanistic approach to the design of P23219 selective agents . DB02709 ( 3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene ) is a phytoalexin found in grapes that has anti-inflammatory , cardiovascular protective , and cancer chemopreventive properties . It has been shown to target prostaglandin H(2) synthase ( P36551 ) -1 and P35354 , which catalyze the first committed step in the synthesis of prostaglandins via sequential cyclooxygenase and peroxidase reactions . DB02709 discriminates between both P36551 isoforms . It is a potent inhibitor of both catalytic activities of P23219 , the desired drug target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , but only a weak inhibitor of the peroxidase activity of P35354 , the isoform target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . We have investigated the unique inhibitory properties of resveratrol . We find that it is a potent peroxidase-mediated mechanism-based inactivator of P23219 only ( k(inact) = 0.069 +/- 0.004 s(-1) , K(i(inact)) = 1.52 +/- 0.15 microm ) , with a calculated partition ratio of 22 . Inactivation of P23219 was time- and concentration-dependent , it had an absolute requirement for a peroxide substrate , and it was accompanied by a concomitant oxidation of resveratrol . DB02709 -inactivated P23219 was devoid of both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities , neither of which could be restored upon gel-filtration chromatography . Inactivation of P23219 by [(3)H]resveratrol was not accompanied by stable covalent modification as evident by both SDS-PAGE and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography analysis . Structure activity relationships on methoxy-resveratrol analogs showed that the m-hydroquinone moiety was essential for irreversible inactivation of P23219 . We propose that resveratrol inactivates P23219 by a " hit-and-run " mechanism , and offers a basis for the design of selective P23219 inactivators that work through a mechanism-based event at the peroxidase active site .
