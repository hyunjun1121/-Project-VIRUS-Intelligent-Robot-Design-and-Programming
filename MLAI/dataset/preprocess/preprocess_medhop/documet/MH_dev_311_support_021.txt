5-Hydroxytryptamine stimulates cyclic AMP formation in the tunica muscularis mucosae of the rat oesophagus via Q13639 receptors . The nature of Q13639 receptor coupling in the tunica muscularis mucosae of the rat oesophagus has been studied . 5-HT and renzapride stimulated cyclic AMP formation concentration dependently , with -log EC50 values of 7.1 and 6.8 , respectively . DB04917 , relative to 5-HT , acted as a partial agonist . Tropisetron ( ICS 205 930 ) and a novel Q13639 antagonist , SDZ 205 557 , inhibited 5-HT-induced cyclic AMP production competitively , with pA2 estimates of 6.7 and 7.7 , respectively . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Q13639 receptors mediate relaxation of the smooth muscle cells of the tunica muscularis mucosae of rat oesophagus via activation of adenylyl cyclase .
