Inactivation of caspase-1 in rodent brain : a novel anticonvulsive strategy . PURPOSE : Cytokines and related inflammatory mediators are rapidly synthesized in the brain during seizures . We previously found that intracerebral administration of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) -beta has proconvulsant effects , whereas its endogenous receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) mediates potent anticonvulsant actions in various models of limbic seizures . In this study , we investigated whether seizures can be effectively inhibited by blocking the brain production of IL-1beta , by using selective inhibitors of interleukin-converting enzyme ( ICE/caspase-1 ) or through caspase-1 gene deletion . METHODS : P29466 was selectively blocked by using pralnacasan or DB05507 . IL-1beta release was induced in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures by proinflammatory stimuli [ lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) + adenosine triphosphate ( DB00171 ) ] and measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . IL-1beta production during seizures was measured in the rat hippocampus by Western blot . Seizures were induced in freely moving mice and rats by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and recorded by EEG analysis . RESULTS : P29466 inhibition reduced the release of IL-1beta in organotypic slices exposed to LPS+ DB00171 . Administration of pralnacasan ( intracerebroventricular , 50 microg ) or DB05507 ( intraperitoneal , 25-200 mg/kg ) to rats blocked seizure-induced production of IL-1beta in the hippocampus , and resulted in a twofold delay in seizure onset and 50 % reduction in seizure duration . Mice with caspase-1 gene deletion showed a 70 % reduction in seizures and an approximate fourfold delay in their onset . CONCLUSIONS : Inhibition of caspase-1 represents an effective and novel anticonvulsive strategy , which acts by selectively reducing the brain availability of IL-1beta .
