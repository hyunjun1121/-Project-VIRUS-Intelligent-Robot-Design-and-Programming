Irreversible P00533 inhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is among the most important targets in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Erlotinib and gefitinib , two small molecules , are reversible P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) . Non-small cell lung cancers with P00533 mutations , are characterized by excellent responses when treated with the P00533 -TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib . However , all the patients with tumors harbouring P00533 mutations experience disease progression after a median of 10 to 14 months of treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib . A group of new generation P00533 -TKIs irreversibly inhibit P00533 -TK and represent one of the strategies that may potentially overcome the acquired resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib or achieve better outcomes than reversible inhibitors in the first-line treatment of P00533 mutant lung cancers . DB08916 ( DB08916 ) and PF299804 are the irreversible P00533 -TKIs with the most relevant data in the treatment of advanced NSCLC , as primary P00533 -targeted therapy and after resistance to reversible P00533 -TKIs . However , to date , the role of irreversible P00533 inhibitors remains to be defined .
