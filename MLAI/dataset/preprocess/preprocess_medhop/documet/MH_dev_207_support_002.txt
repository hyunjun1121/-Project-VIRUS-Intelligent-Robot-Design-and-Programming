Inhibition of the invasion capacity of carcinoma cells by DB05476 , a novel synthetic inhibitor of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system . The overall survival rate of patients suffering from carcinomas has remained poor and nearly unchanged over the last decades . This is mainly due to the so-called minimal residual disease , i.e. , remaining tumor cells that overcome surgery and/or radiotherapy and are the cause of locoregional and distant metastases . To metastasize , tumor cells take advantage of proteases to invade and remodel surrounding tissues . Here , we analyzed the efficiency of DB05476 , a novel 3-amidinophenylalanine-based inhibitor of the uPA system , at inhibiting the invasive capacity of carcinoma cells . First , Q03405 expression was characterized in different carcinoma cell lines , including SCCHN , breast and cervical carcinoma . Thereafter , the invasive potential of these cell lines was determined using Matrigel invasion chambers and a spheroid cocultivation model with human fibroblasts . Q03405 expression levels correlated positively with invasion capacity , which could be significantly inhibited by DB05476 . A decrease of tumor cell invasion by up to 50 % was achieved in both models with the SCCHN line FaDu and the cervical carcinoma line HeLa after treatment with DB05476 . Thus , our results demonstrate the potential of DB05476 in vitro as a promising adjuvant antimetastatic therapy of carcinomas .
