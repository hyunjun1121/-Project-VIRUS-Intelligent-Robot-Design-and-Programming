P60568 suppression by 2-arachidonyl glycerol is mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma independently of cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 . 2-Arachidonyl glycerol ( 2-AG ) is an endogenous arachidonic acid derivative that binds cannabinoid receptors P21554 and CB2 and is hence termed an endocannabinoid . 2-AG also modulates a variety of immunological responses , including expression of the autocrine/paracrine T cell growth factor interleukin ( IL ) -2 . The objective of the present studies was to determine the mechanism responsible for P60568 suppression by 2-AG . Because of the labile properties of 2-AG , 2-AG ether , a nonhydrolyzable analog of 2-AG , was also used . Both 2-AG and 2-AG ether suppressed P60568 expression independently of P21554 and CB2 , as demonstrated in leukocytes derived from P21554 /CB2-null mice . Moreover , we demonstrated that both 2-AG and 2-AG ether treatment activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , as evidenced by forced differentiation of 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells into adipocytes , induction of aP2 mRNA levels , and activation of a PPARgamma-specific luciferase reporter in transiently transfected 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells . Consequently , the putative role of PPARgamma in P60568 suppression by 2-AG and 2-AG ether was examined in Jurkat T cells . Concordant with PPARgamma involvement , the PPARgamma-specific antagonist 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-(4-pyridyl)-benzamide ( T0070907 ) blocked 2-AG- and 2-AG ether-mediated P60568 suppression . Likewise , 2-AG suppressed the transcriptional activity of two transcription factors crucial for P60568 expression , nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor kappaB , in the absence but not in the presence of T0070907 . 2-AG treatment also induced PPARgamma binding to a Q07869 response element in activated Jurkat T cells . Together , the aforementioned studies identify PPARgamma as a novel intracellular target of 2-AG , which mediates the suppression of P60568 by 2-AG in a manner that is independent of P21554 and/or CB2 .
