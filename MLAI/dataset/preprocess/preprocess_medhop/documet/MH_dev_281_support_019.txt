P35354 derived DB00917 and DB01240 play an important role via EP2 and PPARdelta receptors in early steps of oil induced decidualization in mice . Differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into decidual cells ( decidualization ) is prerequisite for blastocyst implantation . Different prostanoids are shown to be involved in the cascade of events found in implantation and decidualization . Previous reports described that cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) derived prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) plays an important role via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( PPARdelta ) nuclear receptor in implantation and decidualization . Herein , we investigated the role of P35354 derived DB00917 and DB01240 and examined the protein expression and regulation of P23219 , P35354 , membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase ( mPGES-1 ) , prostaglandin I synthase ( PGIS ) , DB00917 receptor ( EP2 ) and PPARdelta in hormone primed oil infused uterine horn as well as in non-infused uterine horn ( control horn ) . Our results show that selective P35354 inhibitor ( DB04743 ) inhibits decidualization while P23219 inhibitor ( SC560 ) does not affect decidualization . P35354 , mPGES-1 , PGIS , EP2 and PPARdelta immunostaining are strongly observed at 24 h and 48 h in oil-induced horn and than significantly reduced at 72 h and 120 h and absent in non-infused horn . However P23219 immunostaining is observed in infused as well as in non-infused horn . Our immunohistochemical studies corroborated well with follow up western blotting of the same proteins . DB00917 and DB01240 products were also elevated at 24h and 48 h after oil induction in infused horn in comparison to control horn . Our data suggest that P35354 derived both DB00917 and DB01240 mediate its function via EP2 and PPARdelta receptors in early steps of decidualization in mice .
