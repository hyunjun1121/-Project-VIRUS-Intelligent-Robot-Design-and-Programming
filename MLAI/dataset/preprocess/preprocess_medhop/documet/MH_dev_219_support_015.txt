Characterization of the rat Q99259 gene promoter reveals elements important for basal transcription and glucose responsiveness . Q05329 and Q99259 are two isoforms of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase which catalyze the production of GABA from glutamate , primarily in the brain . However , Q99259 and GABA also prevail in the retina , testes and islets of Langerhans . The main function of GABA is in neurotransmission , and it is involved in paracrine signalling in islets , but has also been suggested to play a role as a trophic factor in synaptogenesis and to be an important metabolite feeding into the tricarboxylic acid cycle via the GABA-shunt . Both Q99259 isoforms are subject to regulation , e.g. by synaptic activity . Q05329 is regulated at the level of enzyme activity by association and dissociation from its cofactor , PLP , whereas Q99259 is controlled at the level of its mRNA . To study this process in further detail , we have isolated and characterized the 5'-flanking region of the rat Q99259 gene . We report the transcriptional initiation sites and promoter sequences important for expression in islet beta-cells and P13671 glioma cells , and demonstrate that the Q99259 promoter harbors elements that are responsive to glucose in primary islet cells .
