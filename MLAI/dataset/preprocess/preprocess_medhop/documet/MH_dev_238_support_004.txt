Glutamate modulators as potential therapeutic drugs in schizophrenia and affective disorders . Severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are related to cognitive and negative symptoms , which often are resistant to current treatment approaches . The glutamatergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and affective disorders . A key component is the dysfunction of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor . Substances regulating activation/inhibition of the DB01221 receptor have been investigated in schizophrenia and major depression and are promising in therapeutic approaches of negative symptoms , cognition , and mood . In schizophrenia , add-on treatments with glycine , D-serine , D-alanine , D-cycloserine , D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors , glycine transporter-1 ( P48067 ) inhibitors ( e.g. , sarcosine , bitopertin ) and agonists ( e.g. , DB05096 ) or positive allosteric modulator ( e.g. , ADX71149 ) of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) have been studied . In major depression , the DB01221 receptor antagonists ( e.g. , ketamine , AZD6765 ) , Q13224 subtype antagonists ( e.g. , traxoprodil , MK-0657 ) , and partial agonists ( e.g. , D-cycloserine , GLYX-13 ) at the glycine site of the DB01221 receptor have been proven to be effective in animal studies and first clinical trials . In addition , clinical studies of Q14416 /3 antagonist BCI-838 ( a prodrug of BCI-632 ( MGS0039 ) ) , Q14416 /3-negative allosteric modulators ( NMAs ) ( e.g. , RO499819 , RO4432717 ) , and P41594 NAMs ( e.g. , AZD2066 , RO4917523 ) are in progress . Future investigations should include effects on brain structure and activation to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying efficacy of these drugs .
