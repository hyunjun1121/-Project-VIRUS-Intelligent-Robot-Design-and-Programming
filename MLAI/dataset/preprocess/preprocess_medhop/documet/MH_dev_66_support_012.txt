Anti- P05231 -receptor-alpha ( tocilizumab ) does not inhibit human monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation or alloreactive T-cell responses . Significant comorbidites and lethality complicate GVHD and its treatment . Targeting the cytokine milieu may improve GVHD control ; and P05231 is an attractive candidate , given its role in dendritic cell activation and T-cell differentiation . DB06273 is a humanized mAb to P05231 -receptor-α ( P08887 -α ) , which is Food and Drug Administration-approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Mouse transplant models have demonstrated that P05231 blockade also improves GVHD scores and survival . Definitive immunologic effects of P05231 inhibition have not emerged given inconsistent alterations in regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) and suppression of T-cell proliferation . Despite on-target suppression of P08887 -α signaling in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( moDCs ) and T cells , our data show no effect on moDC maturation/activation , alloreactive T-cell proliferation , Treg expansion , or allogeneic Th1/Th17 responses in vitro . These findings merit attention in any clinical trials of tocilizumab for GVHD prevention or treatment and provide a rationale for evaluating more specific inhibitors of downstream O60674 / P40763 signaling as well .
