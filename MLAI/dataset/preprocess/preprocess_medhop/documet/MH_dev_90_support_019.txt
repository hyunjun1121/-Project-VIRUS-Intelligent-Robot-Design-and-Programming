The O60656 enzyme is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma target gene . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) alpha and gamma are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family . Q07869 alpha mediates the hypolipidemic action of the fibrates , whereas Q07869 gamma is a receptor for the antidiabetic glitazones . In the present study , the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ( P78381 ) 1A9 enzyme is identified as a Q07869 alpha and Q07869 gamma target gene . UGTs catalyze the glucuronidation reaction , which is a major pathway in the catabolism and elimination of numerous endo- and xenobiotics . Among the P22309 family enzymes , O60656 metabolizes endogenous compounds , including catecholestrogens , and xenobiotics , such as fibrates and to a lesser extent troglitazone . Treatment of human hepatocytes and macrophages and murine adipocytes with activators of Q07869 alpha or Q07869 gamma resulted in an enhanced O60656 expression and activity . In addition , disruption of the Q07869 alpha gene in mice completely abolished the Q07869 alpha agonist-induced O60656 mRNA and activity levels . A Q07869 response element was identified in the promoter of O60656 at positions -719 to -706 bp by transient transfection and electromobility shift assays . Considering the role of O60656 in catecholestrogen metabolism , Q07869 alpha and Q07869 gamma activation may contribute to the protection against genotoxic catecholestrogens by stimulating their inactivation in glucuronide derivatives . Furthermore , since O60656 is involved in the catabolism of fibrates , these results suggest that Q07869 alpha and Q07869 gamma may control the intracellular level of active fibrates .
