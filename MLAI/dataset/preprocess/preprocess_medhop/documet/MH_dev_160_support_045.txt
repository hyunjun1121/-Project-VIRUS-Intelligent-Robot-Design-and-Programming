DB00065 induces potent anti-inflammatory responses by outside-to-inside signals through transmembrane P01375 . BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Both infliximab ( chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor [ P01375 ] -alpha antibody ) and etanercept ( p75 P01375 receptor/immunoglobulin G fusion protein ) are effective against rheumatoid arthritis , but only infliximab induces clinical remission in Crohn 's disease . To clarify this difference in clinical efficacy , we investigated reverse signaling through transmembrane P01375 ( mTNF ) by these 2 anti- P01375 agents . METHODS : We stably transfected wild-type and cytoplasmic serine-replaced mutant forms of mTNF in human Jurkat T cells . Cells were stimulated with infliximab and etanercept and then analyzed for P16581 expression , reactive oxygen species accumulation , apoptosis , and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry . P22301 and interferon-gamma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase , Bax , Bak , P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) , caspase-8 , and caspase-3 were examined by immunoblotting . RESULTS : Both anti- P01375 agents induced P16581 expression , but only infliximab induced interleukin-10 production , apoptosis , and G0/ P55008 cell cycle arrest . Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were abolished by substitution of all 3 cytoplasmic serine residues of mTNF by alanine residues . DB00065 induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and up-regulation of Bax , Bak , and P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) proteins , suggesting the involvement of p53 activation . Moreover , phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase was necessary for infliximab-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . CONCLUSIONS : We revealed the mTNF motifs and the downstream intracellular molecular events essential for reverse signaling through mTNF . The biologic effects of mTNF elicited by infliximab should be important action mechanisms of this potent anti-inflammatory agent in addition to the neutralization of soluble P01375 . These observations will provide insight into the novel role of mTNF in inflammation .
