Effects of Asn318 and Asp87Asn318 mutations on signal transduction by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and receptor regulation . P30968 ( P30968 ) contains Asn87 and Asp318 instead of the more frequently observed Asp87 and Asn318 found in other G protein-coupled receptors . In the present study , site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce Asn318 and Asp87Asn318 into P30968 . The effect on coupling and regulation of P30968 was studied by stable expression of wild and mutant mouse P30968 in the lactotropic GH3 cells ; these normally release PRL in response to TRH stimulation . The responses to DB06719 ( a metabolically stable DB00644 analog ) in three different cell lines , M1 , N8 , and P03886 ( expressing wild-type , Asn318 mutant , and Asp87Asn318 mutant mouse P30968 , respectively ) were compared with that observed in the previously characterized GGH3-1 ' cells , which stably express rat P30968 . The Asn318 and Asp87Asn318 mutations had no measurable effect on ligand binding , but abolished the initial down-regulation of receptor that was observed in M1 and GGH3-1 ' cells , suggesting that the normal location of Asn87 and Asp318 in P30968 is involved in the regulation of P30968 . In N8 and P03886 cells , DB06719 -stimulated inositol phosphate ( IP ) production was attenuated , but the release of both DB02527 and PRL was stimulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner . These mutations apparently impaired the coupling between P30968 and G proteins involved in IP production , but not those involved in DB02527 release . In M1 cells , DB06719 stimulation produced a significant increase in IP production , but neither DB02527 nor PRL release was significantly stimulated . These findings are consistent with the previous suggestion that DB00644 -stimulated PRL release is mediated by a DB02527 second messenger system in transfected GGH3 cells .
