Molecular dissection of dimethylnitrosamine ( O15061 ) -induced hepatotoxicity by mRNA differential display . Differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( DDRT-PCR ) was used to catalogue altered hepatic transcript expression during dimethylnitrosamine ( O15061 ) exposure in vivo . Mice were administered O15061 ( 1.5 or 5 mg/kg ) or vehicle ( phosphate-buffered saline ) i.p. once daily for up to 7 days , and livers were collected 6 h post-injection . Total RNA was reverse transcribed and cDNA subsets were selectively amplified by PCR . DDRT-PCR products were fractionated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels , and differentially expressed bands were excised , reamplified , and subsequently cloned into a plasmid vector . This study identified 23 cDNAs that were induced and 25 cDNAs that were suppressed during O15061 exposure . Altered expression during O15061 exposure for cDNA clones was confirmed by Northern blotting , RNase protection , or in situ hybridization analyses . DNA sequence information indicated that four cDNAs suppressed during O15061 exposure encode cytochrome P450 isoenzyme-cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) , a monokine , a myeloid cell differentiation protein , and mouse major urinary protein ( MUP ) . We further observed a O15061 -induced increase in transcripts for complement factor 3 ( P01024 ) and serum amyloid A ( P0DJI8 ) . In contrast , the remaining differentially expressed transcripts detected by DDRT-PCR during O15061 exposure demonstrated no similarity to sequences present in Genbank , suggesting that they may encode previously unreported gene products . In situ hybridization showed MUP transcripts to be expressed by hepatic centrilobular areas that undergo necrosis during subchronic O15061 exposure . Thus , the utilization of DDRT-PCR has identified several differentially expressed hepatic mRNAs associated with various doses and stages of O15061 exposure .
