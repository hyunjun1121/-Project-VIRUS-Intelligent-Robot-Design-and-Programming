Stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( P48061 ) enhances cells invasion by αvβ6 integrin-mediated signaling in ovarian cancer . Ovarian carcinoma is a common gynecological malignancy and a great threat to health as a result of metastasis . The chemokine stromal-derived factor ( P48061 ) plays multiple roles in tumor pathogenesis . However , the precise molecular mechanism underlying P48061 -induced ovarian cancer cell invasion is still undefined . αvβ6 integrin is an important factor in tumor progression . Therefore , we speculate that P48061 -enhanced ovarian cancer cell invasion is related to αvβ6 integrin-mediated signaling . After culturing with P48061 , an obvious time- and dose-dependent increase in αvβ6 integrin was demonstrated . Furthermore , CXC receptor 4 ( P61073 ) was responsible for P48061 -induced αvβ6 integrin expression . Simultaneously , P48061 was found to dramatically enhance extracellular matrix degradation via urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) expression and cell invasion by αvβ6 integrin expression ; these reinforce failed to be increased when pretreatment was performed with the P61073 inhibitor DB06809 or anti-αvβ6 integrin antibody , respectively . In addition , αvβ6 integrin induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and P19957 K/Akt , contributing to the up-regulation of uPA , as treatment with the specific inhibitor for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) ( SB203580 ) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( P19957 K ) /Akt ( LY294002 ) strikingly abrogated uPA expression . Taken together , these results demonstrated that P48061 enhanced ovarian cancer cell invasion through αvβ6 integrin-mediated uPA expression via the p38 MAPK and P19957 K/Akt pathway . Consequently , our findings will provide a new explanation about how P48061 aggravates the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer .
