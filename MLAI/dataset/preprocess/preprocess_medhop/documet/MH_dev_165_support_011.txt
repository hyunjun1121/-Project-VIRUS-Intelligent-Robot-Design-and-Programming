DB01268 acts primarily on tumor endothelium rather than tumor cells to inhibit the growth of renal cell carcinoma . DB01268 is a broad-spectrum small-molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) that serves as the present standard of care for first-line therapy of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) . A full understanding of the targets and mechanism of action of sunitinib in ccRCC treatment remains incomplete . In this study , we evaluated several tumor cell and endothelial targets of sunitinib and investigated which RTK(s) may specifically contribute to its therapeutic effects . Microarray expression profiling and Western blot analysis revealed that among known sunitinib targets , only platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( P35968 ) were overexpressed in ccRCCs relative to normal tissues . DB01268 was unable to inhibit survival or proliferation of ccRCC cells at pharmacologically relevant concentrations ( approximately 0.1 micromol/L ) that inhibit RTK targets . In contrast , sunitinib inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and motility at the same concentrations by suppressing P35968 signaling . Moreover , whereas sunitinib inhibited the growth of ccRCC xenograft tumors and decreased tumor microvessel density as soon as 12 hours after treatment , sunitinib showed no significant effects on tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis up to 72 hours after treatment . Our findings indicate that sunitinib inhibits ccRCC growth primarily through an antiangiogenic mechanism and not through direct targeting of ccRCC tumor cells .
