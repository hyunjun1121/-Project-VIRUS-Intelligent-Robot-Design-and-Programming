P14921 , NFkappaB and P05412 synergistically transactivate the human GM- P04141 promoter . Activation of helper T cells results in coordinate expression of a number of cytokines involved in differentiation , proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system . Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM- P04141 ) is one such cytokine , whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription . Cis-acting elements with NFkappaB , P05412 and ETS-like binding motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM- P04141 gene , and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation . P14921 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is expressed in T cells . We have previously shown that P14921 can transactivate GM- P04141 in Jurkat T cells , but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin , agents that mimic T cell activation . Thus we proposed that P14921 , which is expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells , may act in concert with PMA/ionomycin inducible factors . Here we show that P14921 can transactivate a GM- P04141 reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells , providing that either NFkappaB or P05412 transcription factors are supplied by co-transfection . We confirm that binding of endogenous NFkappaB and P05412 is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells . Transactivation by P14921 , NFkappaB and P05412 is synergistic , and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are interdependent . Our results suggest that constitutive P14921 , and inducible NFkappaB and P05412 , cooperate as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells .
