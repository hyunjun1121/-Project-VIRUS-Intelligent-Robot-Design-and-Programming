Low-density lipoprotein apheresis reduces platelet factor 4 on the surface of platelets : a possible protective mechanism against heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis . BACKGROUND : DB01109 -induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis ( HITT ) is characterized by thrombocytopenia due to the formation of antibodies against heparin : platelet factor 4 ( P02776 ) complexes . Despite the exposure to heparin during treatment and predisposition of patients with atherosclerosis to HITT , HITT in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) apheresis is rare . We investigated the possibility that LDL apheresis decreases P02776 on platelet ( Q02083 ) surfaces and/or plasma HITT antibody levels , either of which would disfavor HITT . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : We enrolled 25 patients undergoing LDL apheresis at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania . Blood samples were drawn before and after treatment . Plasma samples were drawn proximal and distal to the LA-15 treatment column . P02776 , HITT antibodies , heparin levels , and P16109 were measured . RESULTS : No patient had clinical symptoms of HITT . The LA-15 column was found to efficiently remove P02776 . P02776 levels in peripheral blood plasma did not change significantly after LDL apheresis . However , Q02083 surface P02776 significantly decreased after treatment . HITT antibodies were found in only two patients and were nonfunctional . Q02083 surface P16109 did not change during treatment . CONCLUSIONS : We have demonstrated that LDL apheresis via dextran sulfate absorption removes plasma P02776 and reduces the amount of P02776 on the surface of circulating PLTs . Reduced surface P02776 may decrease antibody formation and/or recognition by HITT antibodies . These data provide a potential explanation for the near lack of HITT in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing LDL apheresis . They also suggest the possibility that LDL apheresis using dextran sulfate adsorption may have therapeutic value in the treatment of HITT .
