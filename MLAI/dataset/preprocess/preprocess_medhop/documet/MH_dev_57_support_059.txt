Synthesis , biological activity and HPLC validation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . The synthesis and biochemical evaluation of new hybrids of tacrine ( DB00382 ) and 4-fluorobenzoic acid ( 4-FBA ) possessing activity towards acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) inhibition are presented . The compounds of interest were obtained from the reaction of activated 4-FBA and diamino derivatives of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine . The compounds P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -4KW/HCl and P13671 -3KW/HCl have four-fold higher antiacetylcholinesterase activity than DB00382 . All of the acquired compounds present higher selectivity towards P22303 than DB00382 and lower selectivity towards BuChE . In addition , a rapid , selective and stability-indicating HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl . DB00382 and 4-FBA were found to be the main impurities . Chromatographic separation was achieved isocratically on a Waters Symmetry C18 150 × 3.9 mm , 4 μm column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/buffer ( 17 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate and 8.3 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate , 50:50 v/v ) ( overall pH 4 ) . A 1.5 ml/min flow rate and a 247 nm wavelength were chosen for this method . P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl were subjected to acidic and basic hydrolysis , chemical oxidation , thermal exposition at 60 °C and intense UV light . The limits of detection ( LOD ) and quantification ( LOQ ) were less than 2 μg/ml and 6 μg/ml for P13671 -2KW/HCl , P13671 -3KW/HCl and P13671 -4KW/HCl , 0.04 μg/ml and 0.12 μg/ml for DB00382 , 0.42 μg/ml and 1.41 μg/ml for 4-FBA , respectively .
