P10275 as a therapeutic target . Androgens function as sex hormone primarily via activation of a single androgen receptor ( AR , or P10275 ) . AR is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases such as hypogonadism and prostate cancer . AR ligands of different chemical structures and/or pharmacological properties are widely used for these therapeutic applications , and all of the AR ligands currently available for therapy modulate AR function via direct binding to the ligand-binding pocket ( P18428 ) of the receptor . In the past ten years , our understanding of AR structure and molecular mechanism of action has progressed extensively , which has encouraged the rapid development of newer generation of AR ligands , particularly tissue-selective AR ligands . With improved tissue selectivity , future generations of AR ligands are expected to greatly expand the therapeutic applications of this class of drugs . This review will provide an overview of the common therapeutic applications of currently available AR ligands , and discussion of the major challenges as well as novel therapeutic strategies proposed for future drug development .
