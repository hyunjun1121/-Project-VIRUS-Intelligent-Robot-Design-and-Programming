Immunohistochemical analysis of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in the uterine carcinosarcoma : a case report . Uterine carcinosarcoma ( malignant mixed Mullerian tumor ) is an uncommon female genital tract neoplasm characterized by an admixture of epithelial and stromal malignant cells . We report a case of 50-year-old peri-menopausal woman diagnosed to have early-stage ( IB due to FIGO ) uterine carcinosarcoma of the homologous type with superficial ( 3mm ) myo-invasion . The patient showed no clinical symptoms of the disease and had no family history of female genital tract malignancies . Positive immunostaining for steroid receptors ( estrogen-alpha and progesterone receptors ) , cytokeratin , and P00533 was detected only in the carcinomatous area , whereas beta-catenin , BCL-2 , P35354 , p16(INK4a) , P60484 , Q8IUH3 , and vimentin were immunoreactive in both components . P10275 , CD10 , desmin , HER-2/neu , and P04637 were found to be negative either in the carcinomatous or in the sarcomatous area . Tumor proliferative activity was higher in the carcinomatous ( 25 % ) than in the sarcomatous ( 2 % ) component . Based on these findings , immunohistochemical evaluation of multiple receptor status in the carcinomatous and sarcomatous areas of carcinosarcoma may provide a clue to the pathogenesis and hormonal receptor status of this uncommon uterine malignancy .
