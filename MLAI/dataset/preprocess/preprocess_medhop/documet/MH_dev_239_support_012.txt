Inhibitory effects of imatinib on vitamin D₃ synthesis in human keratinocytes . Chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the presence of the BCR‑ P00519 fusion gene , a constitutively active , oncogenic tyrosine kinase that is responsible for the clinical features of CML . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors , such as imatinib , have markedly altered the treatment of CML . However , tyrosine kinase inhibitors are associated with side effects on bone metabolism , in adult and pediatric patients . DB00169 is involved in the complex cycle of bone remodeling , therefore the present study aimed to investigate the influence of imatinib on vitamin D3 metabolism in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line , using commercially available enzyme assays . Imatinib was shown to significantly reduce the production of calcidiol and calcitriol . Based on interaction studies of imatinib with the cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) inhibitors VID400 and ketoconazole , it is proposed that imatinib may interfere with the vitamin D3 cascade due to its metabolism by O15528 , which is involved in vitamin D3 metabolism .
