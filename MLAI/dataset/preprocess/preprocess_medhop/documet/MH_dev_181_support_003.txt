O15379 represses the expression of P26718 ligands ULBPs in epithelial tumour cells : potential implications for the immunosurveillance of cancer . The expression of the P26718 ligands on cancer cells leads to their recognition and elimination by host immune responses mediated by natural killer and T cells . UL16-binding proteins ( ULBPs ) are P26718 ligands , which are scarcely expressed in epithelial tumours , favouring their evasion from the immune system . Herein , we investigated the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the repression of ULBPs in epithelial cancer cells . We show that Q9BZM6 -3 expression is increased in tumour cells after exposure to the inhibitor of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) trichostatin A ( P32119 ) , which enhances the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity of HeLa cells . Our experiments showed that the transcription factor Sp3 is crucial in the activation of the Q9BZM6 promoter by P32119 . Furthermore , by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression of Q13547 -3 , we showed that O15379 is a repressor of ULBPs expression in epithelial cancer cells . Remarkably , P32119 treatment caused the complete release of O15379 from the Q9BZM6 -3 promoters . O15379 is recruited to the Q9BZM6 promoter through its interaction with Sp3 and P32119 treatment interfered with this association . Together , we describe a new mechanism by which cancer cells may evade the immune response through the epigenetic modulation of the ULBPs expression and provide a model in which HDAC inhibitors may favour the elimination of transformed cells by increasing the immunogenicity of epithelial tumours .
