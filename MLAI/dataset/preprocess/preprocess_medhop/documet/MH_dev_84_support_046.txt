Simultaneous inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) signaling and enhanced activation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( P50591 ) receptor-mediated apoptosis induction by an scFv:sTRAIL fusion protein with specificity for human P00533 . P00533 ( P00533 ) signaling inhibition by monoclonal antibodies and P00533 -specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors has shown clinical efficacy in cancer by restoring susceptibility of tumor cells to therapeutic apoptosis induction . P01375 -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( P50591 ) is a promising anti-cancer agent with tumor-selective apoptotic activity . Here we present a novel approach that combines P00533 -signaling inhibition with target cell-restricted apoptosis induction using a P50591 fusion protein with engineered specificity for P00533 . This fusion protein , scFv425:sTRAIL , comprises the P00533 -blocking antibody fragment scFv425 genetically fused to soluble P50591 ( sTRAIL ) . Treatment with scFv425:sTRAIL resulted in the specific accretion to the cell surface of P00533 -positive cells only . P00533 -specific binding rapidly induced a dephosphorylation of P00533 and down-stream mitogenic signaling , which was accompanied by cFLIP(L) down-regulation and Bad dephosphorylation . P00533 -specific binding converted soluble scFv425:sTRAIL into a membrane-bound form of P50591 that cross-linked agonistic P50591 receptors in a paracrine manner , resulting in potent apoptosis induction in a series of P00533 -positive tumor cell lines . Co-treatment of P00533 -positive tumor cells with the P00533 -tyrosine kinase inhibitor DB00317 resulted in a potent synergistic pro-apoptotic effect , caused by the specific down-regulation of O15519 . Furthermore , in mixed culture experiments binding (L)of scFv425:sTRAIL to P00533 -positive target cells conveyed a potent apoptotic effect toward P00533 -negative bystander tumor cells . The favorable characteristics of scFv425:sTRAIL , alone and in combination with DB00317 , as well as its potent anti-tumor bystander activity indicate its potential value for treatment of P00533 -expressing cancers .
