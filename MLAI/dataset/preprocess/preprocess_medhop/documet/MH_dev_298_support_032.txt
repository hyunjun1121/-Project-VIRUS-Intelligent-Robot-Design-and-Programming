Fibroblast androgen receptors in patients with genitourinary anomalies . The etiology of certain disorders of sexual differentiation is unclear . The authors have examined the hypothesis that hypospadias and other disorders compatible with a defect in androgen action , such as cryptorchidism , micropenis , chordee/penile torsion , and ectopic testis , might be explained by androgen receptor abnormalities . Therefore , 25 subjects were studied who were selected only because they had one of these developmental defects , together with a predominantly male phenotype , and no readily ascertainable explanation for the defect . Four of these subjects had mixed gonadal dysgenesis with multiple genito-urinary anomalies . They were included for comparative purposes , since there is no evidence for androgen resistance in this disorder . Patients with testicular regression syndrome ( gross testosterone deficiency ) , impaired testosterone biosynthesis ( relative testosterone deficiency ) , 5 alpha-reductase deficiency ( altered T/ DB02901 ratio ) , and a family history or endocrine profile suggestive of androgen resistance , were all excluded from evaluation . P10275 content ( R0 ) and binding affinity ( Kd ) were measured in 26 genital or pubic skin fibroblast strains cultured from 25 affected patients using a dispersed , whole cell assay at 22 C . There was no difference in the mean androgen receptor content ( approximately 10,000 sites/cell ) or binding affinity ( approximately 1 nM ) between the patients ' fibroblasts and those from 26 fibroblast strains established from 26 normal males . Moreover , there were no differences in the nuclear uptake of [3H]dihydro-testosterone into dispersed , intact fibroblasts incubated at 37 C when 11 patient and seven normal male fibroblast strains were compared.
