Expression of the human concentrative nucleotide transporter 1 ( O00337 ) gene correlates with clinical response in patients affected by Waldenström 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) and small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) undergoing a combination treatment with 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine ( DB00242 ) and DB00073 . PURPOSE : Resistance to nucleoside analogues agents is likely to be multifactorial and could involve a number of mechanisms affecting drug penetration , metabolism and targeting . In vitro studies of resistant human cell lines have confirmed that human concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 ( O00337 ) -deficient cells display resistance . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We applied real-time PCR method to assess the mRNA expression of equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporter ( hENT1 , O00337 ) , deoxycytidine and deoxyguanosine kinase ( P27707 , Q16854 ) , 5'-nucleotidase ( 5'-NT ) , ribonucleotide reductase catalytic and regulatory ( P23921 , P31350 ) subunits in bone marrow cells from 32 patients with Waldenström 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) and small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) who received 2CdA-based chemotherapy . Responses to chemotherapy , were then correlated to the expression of these markers . RESULTS : All 32 patients enrolled expressed lower levels of O00337 as compared to healthy donors . In univariate analysis , lower expression level of O00337 ( p=0.0021 ) and P31350 ( p=0.02 ) correlated with response to chemotherapy . In particular , patients with low levels of O00337 achieved inferior clinical response . No significant correlation between these genes expression and age , stage of disease was found . This study suggests that nucleotidase expression levels can be used to identify subgroups of WM and SLL patients who will likely respond differently to a 2CdA-based therapy .
