A possible mechanism of the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum P28222 receptors underlying the antidepressant action of ketamine : a PET study with macaques . DB01221 is a unique anesthetic reagent known to produce various psychotic symptoms . DB01221 has recently been reported to elicit a long-lasting antidepressant effect in patients with major depression . Although recent studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the effects of ketamine , the antidepressant mechanism has not been fully elucidated . To understand the involvement of the brain serotonergic system in the actions of ketamine , we performed a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study on non-human primates . Four rhesus monkeys underwent PET studies with two serotonin ( 5-HT ) -related PET radioligands , [(11)C]AZ10419369 and [(11)C]DASB , which are highly selective for the P28222 receptor and serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) , respectively . Voxel-based analysis using standardized brain images revealed that ketamine administration significantly increased P28222 receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum , whereas it significantly reduced P31645 binding in these brain regions . DB00574 , a 5-HT releaser , significantly decreased P28222 receptor binding , but no additional effect was observed when it was administered with ketamine . Furthermore , pretreatment with 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline ( NBQX ) , a potent antagonist of the glutamate Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid ( AMPA ) receptor , blocked the action of ketamine on the P28222 receptor but not P31645 binding . This indicates the involvement of AMPA receptor activation in ketamine-induced alterations of P28222 receptor binding . Because NBQX is known to block the antidepressant effect of ketamine in rodents , alterations in the serotonergic neurotransmission , particularly upregulation of postsynaptic P28222 receptors in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum may be critically involved in the antidepressant action of ketamine .
