Identification and characterization of a tumor infiltrating CD56(+)/CD16 ( - ) NK cell subset with specificity for pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines . In a recent clinical trial , a patient exhibited regression of several pancreatic cancer metastases following the administration of the immune modulator DB06186 ( anti- P16410 antibody ) . We sought to characterize the immune cells responsible for this regression . Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( Q15399 -2742 ) and an autologous tumor line ( TC-2742 ) were expanded from a regressing metastatic lesion excised from this patient . Natural killer ( NK ) cells predominated in the Q15399 ( 92 % CD56(+) ) with few T cells ( 12 % CD3(+) ) . A majority ( 88 % ) of the NK cells were CD56(bright)CD16(-) . Q15399 -2742 secreted IFN-Î³ and GM- P04141 following co-culture with TC-2742 and major histocompatibility complex mismatched pancreatic tumor lines . After sorting Q15399 -2742 , the purified CD56(+)CD16(-)CD3(-) subset showed reactivity similar to Q15399 -2742 while the CD56(-)CD16(-)CD3(+) cells exhibited no tumor recognition . In co-culture assays , Q15399 -2742 and the NK subset expressed high reactivity to several pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines and could lyse the autologous tumor as well as pancreas and prostate cancer lines . Reactivity was partially abrogated by blockade of P50591 . We thus identified a unique subset of NK cells ( CD56(bright)CD16(dim) ) isolated from a regressing metastatic pancreatic cancer in a patient responding to DB06186 . This represents the first report of CD56(+)CD16(-) NK cells with apparent specificity for pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines and associated with tumor regression following the treatment with an immune modulating agent .
