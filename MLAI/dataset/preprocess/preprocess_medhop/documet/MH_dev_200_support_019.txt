Preexisting antigen-specific immune responses are modulated by oral KLH feeding in humans . Oral tolerance is the antigen-specific inhibition of a systemic immune response after oral antigen uptake and well established in animal models . We recently showed that DB05299 ( KLH ) feeding modulates subsequently induced systemic immune responses in humans as well . In the present study , we investigated whether oral KLH can also modulate preexisting antigen-specific systemic B- and T-cell responses . We induced delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reactions as well as systemic KLH-specific B- and T-cell responses by subcutaneous KLH injections . Subsequent oral KLH administration decreased the small proportion of antigen-specific P01730 (+) T cells positive for the cytokine Q16552 at the end of the feeding regimen even further . After reimmunization , there was no difference in DTH reactions and the KLH-specific B-cell responses , but KLH-fed volunteers had an increased proportion of antigen-specific P01730 (+) T cells positive for P22301 and a reduced proportion of antigen-specific P01730 (+) T cells positive for the skin-homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and P60568 and IFN-Î³ . Taken together , oral KLH can modulate a preexisting systemic KLH-specific immune response . These results suggest that feeding antigen may offer therapeutic strategies for the suppression of unwanted immune reactions in humans .
