Aripiprazole : a review of its use in the treatment of manic episodes in adolescents with bipolar I disorder . Aripiprazole ( DB01238 (®) ) is an atypical antipsychotic that is widely used in the treatment of psychiatric conditions . Unlike other currently available atypical antipsychotics that primarily have varying degrees of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism , aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors , which may explain differences in tolerability profiles . Recently in the EU , oral aripiprazole 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in adolescents ( aged ≥13 years ) with bipolar I disorder . Approval was based on a phase 3 , 30-week US trial in children and adolescents with bipolar I disorder experiencing manic or mixed episodes . Using trial data together with ancillary analyses , the European Medicines Agency concluded that aripiprazole 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks was effective in reducing symptoms of mania , but because of the high drop-out rate , efficacy over 30 weeks of treatment was not proven . Aripiprazole was generally well tolerated in the phase 3 trial . Ancillary analyses indicated that tolerability was less favourable in younger ( 10-12 years ) than in older ( ≥13 years ) subjects , and less favourable with the higher ( 30 mg/day ) than the lower dosage ( 10 mg/day ) . The drug is associated with sedation , weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) , although the incidence of EPS over 12 weeks was not significantly different between aripiprazole 10 mg/day and placebo . Data comparing the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of mania in adolescents with bipolar I disorder are limited , but evidence shows that aripiprazole provides a valuable additional therapeutic option for use in this population .
