Roles of purinergic receptor P2Y , G protein-coupled 12 in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice . OBJECTIVE : The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of purinergic receptor P2Y , G protein-coupled 12 ( Q9H244 ) , an ADP receptor , in the development of atherosclerotic lesions . METHODS AND RESULTS : P02649 -null mice were crossed with P2y12(-/-) mice to generate double knockout mice . The double knockout mice and the control apolipoprotein E-null mice were fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks . Assessment of the atherosclerotic lesions in the control and double knockout mice demonstrated that Q9H244 deficiency caused a diminished lesion area , an increased fibrous content at the plaque site , and decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration of the lesions . Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed that white blood cells do not express significant levels of Q9H244 . Bone marrow transplantation experiments confirmed that Q9H244 expressed on platelets is a key factor responsible for atherosclerosis , but do not exclude a role of smooth muscle cell Q9H244 . Supernatant fluid from activated P2y12(+/+) but not P2y12(-/-) platelets was capable of causing monocyte migration . In vitro studies showed that platelet Q9H244 deficiency suppressed platelet factor 4 secretion and P16109 expression . Further work demonstrated that platelet Q9H244 , through inhibition of the DB02527 /protein kinase A pathway , critically regulates the release of platelet factor 4 , and thereby affects monocyte recruitment and infiltration . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that Q9H244 modulates atherogenesis , at least in part by augmenting inflammatory cell recruitment via regulation of platelet Î±-granule release .
