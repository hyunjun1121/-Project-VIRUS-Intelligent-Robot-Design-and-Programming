P36888 inhibition as therapy in acute myeloid leukemia : a record of trials and tribulations . Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a hematologic malignancy with a poor prognosis . Approximately one quarter of the patients with AML also carry an internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutation in the gene encoding P07333 -like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) , which has a significantly deleterious impact on prognosis . The ITD mutation renders P36888 constitutively active and leads to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemic blast . Over the course of the last decade , a variety of compounds have been developed in preclinical and clinical studies as potent inhibitors of P36888 . Many of the earlier agents under investigation , such as lestaurtinib , midostaurin , and sunitinib , were initially developed as inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases and as targeted therapies in a variety of malignancies . These compounds have been demonstrated to have some efficacy in clinical trials of AML , mainly manifesting as transient decreases in circulating blasts correlating with effective in vivo suppression of the P36888 target . Nevertheless , the cumbersome pharmacokinetics of some compounds and the suboptimal specificity and potency of others have limited their therapeutic efficacy . In the last few years , newer , more potent and specific agents have been under investigation , with the leading example being DB05213 . This agent has shown significant promise in early phases of clinical investigation , and is currently in more advanced clinical trials . Hope remains that P36888 inhibition will be become an effective therapeutic adjunct to our current treatment approach to AML .
