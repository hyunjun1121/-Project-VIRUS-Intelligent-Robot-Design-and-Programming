DB00183 infusions in patients with panic disorder . I . Symptoms and cardiovascular responses . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) may mediate human anxiety and animal data suggest that cholecystokinin antagonists could provide an important advance in the treatment of anxiety disorders . The study of CCK receptor systems in psychiatric patients has , however , been severely limited by the lack of available probes . We utilized intravenous infusions of pentagastrin , a selective P32239 agonist , and studied behavioral and cardiovascular responses in 10 patients with panic disorder and 10 normal controls . DB00183 produced substantial symptomatology , including anxiety , and increases in heart rate and blood pressure , in both patients and controls . Patients were more sensitive to the panicogenic effects of the pentagastrin . Panic attacks occurred in 70 % of patients and 0 % of controls . Patients ' symptom responses were very similar to their " typical " panic attacks and to symptoms produced by Q13308 . DB00183 provides a readily available alternative to Q13308 for studying the CCK receptor system and exploring its involvement in human anxiety .
