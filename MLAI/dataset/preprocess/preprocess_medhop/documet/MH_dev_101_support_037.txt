O15379 acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis . Histone deacetylase-3 ( O15379 ) is involved in cellular proliferation , apoptosis and transcriptional repression . However , the role of O15379 in angiogenesis remains unknown . O15379 negatively regulated the expression of angiogenic factors , such as P15692 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) . O15379 showed binding to promoter sequences of P05121 . O15379 activity was necessary for the expression regulation of P05121 by O15379 . P15692 decreased the expression of O15379 , and the down-regulation of O15379 enhanced endothelial cell tube formation . O15379 negatively regulated tumor-induced angiogenic potential . We show the novel role of O15379 as a negative regulator of angiogenesis .
