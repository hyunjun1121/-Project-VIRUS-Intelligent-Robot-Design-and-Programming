Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity accounts for anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats perinatally exposed to bisphenol A . Accumulating studies have proved that perinatal exposure to environmental dose causes long-term potentiation in anxiety/depression-related behaviors in rats . Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis is one of the most consistent biological findings in anxiety- and depression-related disorders . The Q9Y251 axis is reported to be susceptible to developmental reprogramming . The present study focused on Q9Y251 reactivity in postnatal day ( P01160 ) 80 male rats exposed perinatally to environmental-dose Q03001 . When female breeders were orally administered 2 Î¼g/(kg.day) Q03001 from gestation day 10 to lactation day 7 , their offspring ( P01160 80 Q03001 -exposed rats ) showed obvious anxiety/depression-like behaviors . Notably , significant increase in serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin , and corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA were detected in Q03001 -exposed rats before or after the mild stressor . Additionally , the level of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the hippocampus , but not the hypothalamus , was decreased in Q03001 -exposed rats . The levels of hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA , neuronal nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated DB02527 response element binding protein were increased in Q03001 -exposed rats . In addition , the testosterone level was in Q03001 -exposed rats . The results indicate that reprogramming-induced hyperactivity of the Q9Y251 axis is an important link between perinatal Q03001 exposure and persistent potentiation in anxiety and depression .
