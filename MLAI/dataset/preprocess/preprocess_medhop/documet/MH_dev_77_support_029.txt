Differential roles of developmentally distinct P60880 isoforms in the neurotransmitter release process . The role of P60880 ( synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa ) isotypes in the neurotransmitter release process was examined by varying their relative abundance during PC12 cell differentiation induced by nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) . Norepinephrine release by P01138 -differentiated PC12 cells is more sensitive to type A botulinum toxin ( DB00083 ) than by nondifferentiated cells , while both differentiated and nondifferentiated PC12 cells are equally sensitive to type E botulinum toxin ( BoNT/E ) . The differential sensitivity to DB00083 corresponds to an altered susceptibility of P60880 isotypes to DB00083 cleavage in vitro , whereas both isotypes are equally vulnerable to cleavage by BoNT/E . Using recombinant P60880 preparations , we show that DB00083 cleaves P60880 -25b ( present in differentiated cells ) 2-fold more readily than P60880 -25a ( present in both differentiated and nondifferentiated cells ) . Structural studies using far-ultraviolet circular dichroism ( UV -- CD ) and thermal denaturation suggest a difference in the polypeptide folding as the underlying molecular basis for the differential sensitivity of P60880 -25b and P60880 -25a to DB00083 cleavage . We propose differential roles for P60880 -25b and P60880 -25a in the neurotransmitter release process since our results suggest that DB00083 inhibits neurotransmitter release by primarily cleaving P60880 -25b .
