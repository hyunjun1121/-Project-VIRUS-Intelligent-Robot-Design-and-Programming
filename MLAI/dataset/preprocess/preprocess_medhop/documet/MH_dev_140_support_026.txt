Nonclinical safety evaluation of sunitinib : a potent inhibitor of P15692 , PDGF , P10721 , P36888 , and P07949 receptors . DB01268 malate ( SUTENT ) is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor that is approved multinationally for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/-intolerant gastrointestinal stromal tumor and advanced renal cell carcinoma . This paper characterizes the organ toxicity of sunitinib in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys , and the reversibility of any treatment-induced effects . Rats and monkeys received sunitinib ( 0-15 and 0-20 mg/kg/day , respectively ) orally on a consecutive daily dosing schedule for thirteen weeks or on an intermittent daily dosing schedule for up to nine months . Clinical observations and laboratory parameters were recorded . Necropsy was conducted following treatment/recovery periods , and histologic examinations were performed . In rats , sunitinib was generally tolerated at 0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg/day , and findings were reversible . In monkeys , the level at which there were no observed adverse effects was 1.5 mg/kg/day , and findings were similarly reversible ( except for uterine/ovarian weight changes and skin pallor ) . Data suggest that inhibition of multiple RTK pathways may induce pharmacologic effects on organ systems in nonclinical species . Key pharmacologic effects of sunitinib included reversible inhibition of neovascularization into the epiphyseal growth plate , and impaired corpora lutea formation and uterine development during estrus . Similar observations have been noted with this class of RTK signaling inhibitors and are consistent with pharmacologic perturbations of physiologic/angiogenic processes associated with the intended molecular targets .
