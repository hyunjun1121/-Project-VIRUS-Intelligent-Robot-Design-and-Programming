Effect of pitavastatin on transactivation of human serum paraoxonase 1 gene . Hepatic hydroxymethyl glutary coenzyme A P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) have various anti atherosclerosis pleiotropic effects that are independent of cholesterol reduction . Human serum paraoxonase 1 ( P27169 ) is associated with high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and inhibits the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . We investigated the effects of statins on P27169 gene transcription using a reporter gene assay . Promoter activity of the P27169 gene was estimated by measuring luciferase activity of plasmids with a P27169 promoter region transfected into human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells . DB08860 , simvastatin , and atorvastatin each significantly increased P27169 promoter activity , and the transactivation by pitavastatin was abrogated by mevalonic acid and farnesyl pyrophosphate ( FPP ) , however , not by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate . Further , P27169 promoter activity was enhanced by farnesyl transferase inhibitor ( FTI ) , but not by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor ( GGTI ) . P27169 gene transcription has been reported to be dependent on Sp1 and the transactivation by pitavastatin was completely abrogated by mithramycin , an inhibitor of Sp1 . Our results suggest that pitavastatin activates transcription of the P27169 gene through the FPP pathway , which may play an important role in the anti atherosclerotic effects of statins .
