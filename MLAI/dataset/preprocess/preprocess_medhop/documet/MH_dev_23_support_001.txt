Metallothionein prevention of arsenic trioxide-induced cardiac cell death is associated with its inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases activation in vitro and in vivo . Cardiotoxicity induced by arsenic trioxide has become a serious blockade of clinical applications of this effective anticancer agent . The general mechanism responsible for arsenic cardiotoxicity has been attributed to its induction of oxidative stress . Metallothionein ( MT ) has been extensively proven to be a potent endogenous antioxidant that protects heart against oxidative stress-induced cardiac damage . To investigate whether and how MT protects against arsenic cardiotoxicity , MT-overexpressing H9c2 ( MT-H9c2 ) cardiac cells and transgenic ( MT-TG ) mice with their corresponding controls were exposed to the clinical relevant dose of arsenic trioxide . Cardiac cell apoptosis was detected by molecular indices , including the cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 12 , Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio , P35638 expression and/or confirmed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay . DB01169 dose- and time-dependently induced cardiac cell death in H9c2 cells with a significant activation of major MAPK subfamily members such as P27361 /2 , JNK and p38 , but not in MT-H9c2 cells . Importantly , the protective effect of MT on arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death was completely recaptured in the heart of MT-TG with a significant prevention of MAPKs activation . These results indicate that arsenic trioxide-upregulated MAPKs might play important role in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells both in vivo and in vitro , and MT 's suppression of arsenic trioxide apoptotic effect was associated with the inhibition of MAPK activation . Therefore , selective elevation of cardiac MT levels with pharmacological approaches may be a potential strategy for the prevention of arsenic cardiotoxicity .
