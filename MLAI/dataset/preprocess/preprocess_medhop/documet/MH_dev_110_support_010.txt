delta 9- DB00470 increases activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in cultured fetal mesencephalic neurons . The exposure of pregnant rats to delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( delta 9-THC ) , the main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa , during gestation and lactation , affects the gene expression and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) in the brain of their offspring , measured at fetal and early postnatal ages , when the expression of this enzyme plays an important role in neural development . In the present article , we have examined whether delta 9-THC is able to affect TH activity in cultured mesencephalic neurons obtained from fetuses at gestational d 14 . Thus , TH activity increased approximately twofold in cells obtained from naive fetuses when exposed for 24 h to medium containing delta 9-THC . In addition , TH activity was also approx twofold higher in cells obtained from fetuses exposed daily to delta 9-THC from d 5 of gestation than in cells obtained from control fetuses , when both were exposed to basal media . This effect of delta 9-THC on TH activity seems to be produced via the activation to cannabinoid receptors , in particular the P21554 subtype , which would presumably be located in these cells . This is because the exposure to medium containing both delta 9-THC and SR141716A , a specific antagonist for P21554 receptors , abolished the effect observed with delta 9-THC alone . SR141716A alone was without effect on TH activity . Collectively , our results support the notion that delta 9-THC increased TH activity in cultured mesencephalic neurons , as previously observed in vivo , and that this effect was produced by activation of P21554 receptors , which seem to be operative at these early ages . All this points to a role for the endogenous cannabimimetic system in brain development .
