Suppressed Ca2+/ P62158 /CaMKII-dependent K( DB00171 ) channel activity in primary afferent neurons mediates hyperalgesia after axotomy . Painful axotomy decreases K( DB00171 ) channel current ( IK( DB00171 ) ) in primary afferent neurons . Because cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling is depressed in injured dorsal root ganglia ( Q86YR7 ) neurons , we investigated whether Ca(2+)-calmodulin ( P62158 ) -Ca(2+)/ P62158 -dependent kinase II ( CaMKII ) regulates IK( DB00171 ) in large Q86YR7 neurons . Immunohistochemistry identified the presence of K( DB00171 ) channel subunits Q09428 , SUR2 , and Kir6.2 but not Kir6.1 , and pCaMKII in neurofilament 200-positive Q86YR7 somata . Single-channel recordings from cell-attached patches revealed that basal and evoked IK( DB00171 ) by ionomycin , a Ca(2+) ionophore , is activated by CaMKII . In axotomized neurons from rats made hyperalgesic by spinal nerve ligation ( Q16658 ) , basal K( DB00171 ) channel activity was decreased , and sensitivity to ionomycin was abolished . Basal and Ca(2+)-evoked K( DB00171 ) channel activity correlated inversely with the degree of hyperalgesia induced by Q16658 in the rats from which the neurons were isolated . Inhibition of IK( DB00171 ) by glybenclamide , a selective K( DB00171 ) channel inhibitor , depolarized resting membrane potential ( O94763 ) recorded in perforated whole-cell patches and enhanced neurotransmitter release measured by amperometry . The selective K( DB00171 ) channel opener diazoxide hyperpolarized the O94763 and attenuated neurotransmitter release . Axotomized neurons from rats made hyperalgesic by Q16658 lost sensitivity to the myristoylated form of autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide ( AIPm ) , a pseudosubstrate blocker of CaMKII , whereas axotomized neurons from Q16658 animals that failed to develop hyperalgesia showed normal IK( DB00171 ) inhibition by AIPm . AIPm also depolarized O94763 in control neurons via K( DB00171 ) channel inhibition . Unitary current conductance and sensitivity of K( DB00171 ) channels to cytosolic DB00171 and ligands were preserved even after painful nerve injury , thus providing opportunities for selective therapeutic targeting against neuropathic pain .
