17 DB00783 -mediated growth inhibition of MDA-MB-468 cells stably transfected with the estrogen receptor : cell cycle effects . P03372 ( ER ) -negative MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells were stably transfected with wild-type human ER and utilized as a model for investigating estrogen- and aryl hydrocarbon ( Ah ) -responsiveness . Treatment of the stably transfected cells with 10 nM 17 beta-estradiol ( E2 ) resulted in a significant inhibition ( > 60 % ) of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis , which was blocked by 10(-7) M ICI 182 780 . Analysis by flow cytometry indicated that treatment with E2 increased the percentage of cells in G0/ P55008 ( from 68.8 to 89.4 ) and decreased cells in S ( from 18.4 to 3.4 ) and G2/M ( from 12.8 to 7.2 ) phases of the cell cycle . The effects of E2 on the major cyclins , cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors , retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) , Q01094 , and cyclin-dependent kinase activities were also investigated in the stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells . The results demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of 10(-8) M E2 in ER stably transfected MDA-MB-468 cells were associated with modulation of several factors required for cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis , including significant induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21cip-1 ( > 4-fold increase after 12 h ) and decreased Q01094 and P12004 protein levels . These results show that the growth-inhibitory effects of E2 in the stably transfected cells were due to multiple factors which result in growth arrest in G0/ P55008 and inhibition of DNA synthesis .
