DB00197 stimulates beta-arrestin-dependent cardiomyocyte contractility via the angiotensin II type 1A receptor . P37231 ( Q07869 gamma ) agonists are commonly used to treat cardiovascular diseases , and are reported to have several effects on cardiovascular function that may be due to Q07869 gamma-independent signaling events . Select angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) interact with and modulate Q07869 gamma activity , thus we hypothesized that a Q07869 gamma agonist may exert physiologic effects via the angiotensin II type 1(A) receptor ( AT1(A)R ) . In AT1(A)R-overexpressing P29320 293 cells , both angiotensin II ( Ang II ) and the Q07869 gamma agonist troglitazone ( Trog ) enhanced AT1(A)R internalization and recruitment of endogenous beta-arrestin 1/2 ( beta arr1/2 ) to the AT1(A)R . A fluorescence assay to measure diacylglycerol ( DAG ) accumulation showed that although Ang II induced AT1(A)R-G(q) protein-mediated DAG accumulation , Trog had no impact on DAG generation . Trog-mediated recruitment of beta arr1/2 was selective to AT1(A)R as the response was prevented by an ARB- and Trog-mediated beta arr1/2 recruitment to beta1-adrenergic receptor ( beta 1AR ) was not observed . In isolated mouse cardiomyocytes , Trog increased both % and rate of cell shortening to a similar extent as Ang II , effects which were blocked with an ARB . Additionally , these effects were found to be beta arr2-dependent , as cardiomyocytes isolated from beta arr2-KO mice showed blunted contractile responses to Trog . These findings show for the first time that the Q07869 gamma agonist Trog acts at the AT1(A)R to simultaneously block G(q) protein activation and induce the recruitment of beta arr1/2 , which leads to an increase in cardiomyocyte contractility .
