The study of genetic polymorphisms related to serotonin in Alzheimer 's disease : a new perspective in a heterogenic disorder . Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , the most common form of dementia in the elderly . Mutations in 3 genes mapped on chromosomes 21 , 14 and 1 are related to the rare early onset forms of AD while the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E ( P02649 ) gene ( on chromosome 19 ) is the major susceptibility locus for the most common late onset AD ( LOAD ) . Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT ) is a key neurotransmitter implicated in the control of mood , sleep , appetite and a variety of traits and behaviors . Recently , a polymorphism in the transcriptional control region upstream of the 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT ) gene has been studied in several psychiatric diseases and personality traits . It has been demonstrated that the short variant(s) of this 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR ) is associated with a different transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphocytes . An increased frequency of this 5-HTTLPR short variant polymorphism in LOAD was recently reported . In addition , another common polymorphic variation in the 5- Q13049 and P28335 serotonin receptor genes previously analyzed in schizophrenic patients was associated with auditory and visual hallucinations in AD . These observations suggest that the involvement of the serotonin pathway might provide an explanation for some aspects of the affective symptoms commonly observed in AD patients . In summary , research on genetic polymorphisms related to AD and involved in receptors , transporter proteins and the enzymatic machinery of serotonin might enhance our understanding of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder .
