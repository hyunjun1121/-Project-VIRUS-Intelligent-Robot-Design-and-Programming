Clinical utility of ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer . Gastric cancer is currently the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide . Prognosis remains poor with most patients presenting with advanced or metastatic disease . A better understanding of angiogenesis has led to the investigation of drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) pathway including anti- P15692 antibody therapy ( eg , bevacizumab ) , inhibitors of angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases ( eg , sunitinib , sorafenib , apatinib , regorafenib ) , and inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFRs ) ( eg , ramucirumab ) . DB05578 , a P35968 inhibitor , is the first anti-angiogenic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of advanced gastric cancers . This review will focus on the clinical utility and potential use of ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer .
