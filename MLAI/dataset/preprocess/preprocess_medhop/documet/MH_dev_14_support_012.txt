Paraoxonase-1 activity affects the clopidogrel response in P33261 loss-of-function carriers . BACKGROUND : The impact of paraoxonase-1 ( P27169 ) activity on the response to clopidogrel may differ in patients treated with drug-eluting stents ( DES ) in association with P33261 loss-of-function ( LOF ) polymorphisms . METHODS : This study included 112 Japanese patients receiving clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) and aspirin ( 100mg/day ) who underwent optical coherence tomography ( O75051 ) examination 9 months after DES implantation . The P33261 genotype was analyzed and LOF carriers ( 1/2 , 1/3 , 2/2 , 3/3 , 2/3 ) were identified . At the 9-month follow-up , platelet reactivity was determined by measuring the Q9H244 reactivity unit ( PRU ) using a VerifyNow Q9H244 assay , P27169 activity was evaluated and intra-stent thrombus was evaluated by O75051 . RESULTS : Of the 112 Japanese patients , 75 were LOF carriers ( 67.0 % ) . The patients were divided into tertiles according to the P27169 activity ( tertile 1 ; < 230 U/L , tertile 2 ; 230-283U/L , tertile 3 ; > 283 U/L ) . In the VerifyNowP2Y12 analysis , tertile 1 had a higher PRU than tertiles 2 and 3 in LOF carriers , and there was no difference among tertiles in non-carriers . The highest incidence of intra-stent thrombus was observed in tertile 1 followed by tertiles 2 and 3 in LOF carriers , whereas there was no such difference in non-carriers . Multivariate analysis revealed that LOF carriers and P27169 activity tertile 1 were independent predictors of intra-stent thrombus in all patients . In LOF carriers , tertile 1 was the only independent predictor for intra-stent thrombus . CONCLUSION : Low P27169 activity is associated with a low response to clopidogrel and a high frequency of intra-stent thrombus only in LOF carriers .
