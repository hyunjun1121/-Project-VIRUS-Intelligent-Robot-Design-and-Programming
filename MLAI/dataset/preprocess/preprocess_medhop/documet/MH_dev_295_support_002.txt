A Novel mutation in the DB00094 receptor inhibiting signal transduction and causing primary ovarian failure . Inactivating mutations of the DB00094 receptor ( P23945 ) are known to cause ovarian failure with amenorrhea and infertility in women . The first mutation identified in the P23945 gene was a missense mutation ( 566C --> T , predicting Ala189Val transition ) found in several Finnish patients with primary amenorrhea due to ovarian failure . Only five additional , partially or totally inactivating , mutations of the P23945 have been reported . Here , we report a novel P23945 mutation , 1255G --> A , in a Finnish female with primary amenorrhea . The patient was a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the P23945 gene : 566C --> T , the Finnish founder mutation , and 1255G --> A , a previously unidentified mutation . The new mutation is located in exon 10 in the second transmembrane stretch of the P23945 , and it predicts an Ala419Thr change in the protein structure . In functional testing , the mutation was shown to have minimal effect on ligand binding capacity and affinity , but it almost totally abolished the DB02527 second messenger response . Neither of the two P23945 mutations ( 566C --> T or1255G --> A ) was identified in 40 other Finnish patients with premature ovarian failure . Based on this and previous studies , P23945 mutations remain a rare cause of ovarian failure .
