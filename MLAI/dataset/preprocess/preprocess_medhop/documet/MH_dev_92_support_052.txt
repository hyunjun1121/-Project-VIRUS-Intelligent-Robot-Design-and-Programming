Relative contribution of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase to tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) -induced lipolysis in adipocytes . P01375 -α potently stimulates basal lipolysis in adipocytes , which may contribute to hyperlipidemia and peripheral insulin resistance in obesity . Recent studies show that adipose triglyceride lipase ( Q96AD5 ) and hormone-sensitive lipase ( Q05469 ) act sequentially in catalyzing the first two steps of adipose lipolysis in response to β-adrenergic stimulation . Here , we sought to determine their functional roles in P01375 -α-induced lipolysis . Silencing of Q96AD5 expression in adipocytes almost completely abolished basal and P01375 -α-induced glycerol release . In comparison , the glycerol release under the same conditions was only partially decreased upon reduction in expression of either Q05469 or the Q96AD5 coactivator Q8WTS1 . Interestingly , overexpression of Q96AD5 restored the lipolytic rates in cells with silenced Q05469 or Q8WTS1 , indicating a predominant role for Q96AD5 . While expression of Q96AD5 , Q05469 and Q8WTS1 remains mostly unaffected , P01375 -α treatment caused a rapid abrogation of the Q96AD5 inhibitory protein P27469 . P01375 -α drastically decreased the level of P27469 mRNA , and the level of P27469 protein could be maintained by inhibiting proteasomal protein degradation using MG-132 . Furthermore , coexpression of P27469 was able to significantly decrease P01375 -α-stimulated lipolysis mediated by overexpressed Q96AD5 or Q8WTS1 . We propose that the early reduction in P27469 content is permissive for P01375 -α-induced lipolysis .
