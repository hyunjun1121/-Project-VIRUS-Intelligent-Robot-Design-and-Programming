Post-transcriptional regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA stability by Rho GTPase . The mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl ( HMG ) - DB01992 reductase inhibitors increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) expression is unknown . To determine whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affects P29474 expression , human endothelial cells were treated with the P04035 inhibitor , mevastatin ( 1-10 microM ) , in the presence of L-mevalonate ( 200 microM ) , geranylgeranylpyrophosphate ( GGPP , 1-10 microM ) , farnesylpyrophosphate ( FPP , 5-10 microM ) , or low density lipoprotein ( LDL , 1 mg/ml ) . DB06693 increased P29474 mRNA and protein levels by 305 +/- 15 % and 180 +/- 11 % , respectively . Co-treatment with L-mevalonate or GGPP , but not FPP or LDL , reversed mevastatin 's effects . Because Rho GTPases undergo geranylgeranyl modification , we investigated whether Rho regulates P29474 expression . Immunoblot analyses and [35S]GTPgammaS-binding assays revealed that mevastatin inhibited Rho membrane translocation and GTP binding activity by 60 +/- 5 % and 78 +/- 6 % , both of which were reversed by co-treatment with GGPP but not FPP . Furthermore , inhibition of Rho by Clostridium botulinum P01024 transferase ( 50 microg/ml ) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant increased P29474 expression . In contrast , activation of Rho by Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 ( 200 ng/ml ) decreased P29474 expression . These findings indicate that Rho negatively regulates P29474 expression and that P04035 inhibitors up-regulate P29474 expression by blocking Rho geranylgeranylation , which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity .
