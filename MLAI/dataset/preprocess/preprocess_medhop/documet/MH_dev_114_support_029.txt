Eosinophil cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis mediated by exogenous secreted phospholipase A2 group X . Secreted phospholipase A(2) group X ( sPLA(2)-X ) has recently been identified in the airways of patients with asthma and may participate in cysteinyl leukotriene ( CysLT ; C(4) , D(4) , and E(4) ) synthesis . We examined CysLT synthesis and arachidonic acid ( AA ) and lysophospholipid release by eosinophils mediated by recombinant human sPLA(2)-X . We found that recombinant sPLA(2)-X caused marked AA release and a rapid onset of CysLT synthesis in human eosinophils that was blocked by a selective sPLA(2)-X inhibitor . Exogenous sPLA(2)-X released lysophospholipid species that arise from phospholipids enriched in AA in eosinophils , including phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidylethanolamine as well as plasmenyl phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine . CysLT synthesis mediated by sPLA(2)-X but not AA release could be suppressed by inhibition of cPLA(2)α . Exogenous sPLA(2)-X initiated DB00133 (505) phosphorylation of cPLA(2)α , an intracellular Ca(2+) flux , and translocation of cPLA(2)α and P09917 in eosinophils . Synthesis of CysLTs in response to sPLA(2)-X or lysophosphatidylcholine was inhibited by p38 or JNK inhibitors but not by a Q02750 /2 inhibitor . A further increase in CysLT synthesis was induced by the addition of sPLA(2)-X to eosinophils under conditions of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-mediated cPLA(2)α activation . These results indicate that sPLA(2)-X participates in AA and lysophospholipid release , resulting in CysLT synthesis in eosinophils through a mechanism involving p38 and JNK MAPK , cPLA(2)α , and P09917 activation and resulting in the amplification of CysLT synthesis during cPLA(2)α activation . Transactivation of eosinophils by sPLA(2)-X may be an important mechanism leading to CysLT formation in the airways of patients with asthma .
