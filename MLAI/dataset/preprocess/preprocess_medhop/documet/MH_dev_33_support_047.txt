DB08870 : its role in the treatment of anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin 's lymphoma . DB08870 is being developed in a joint collaboration between Seattle Genetics and Millennium : The Takeda Oncology Company . In August 2011 , it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . DB08870 is an antibody-drug conjugate that specifically targets the P01375 receptor superfamily member 8 ( P28908 ) antigen on the surface of cancer cells to induce cell death . DB08870 has shown efficacy in inducing apoptosis in HL and ALCL cell lines that express P28908 and reducing tumor size in preclinical models . DB08870 is under clinical evaluation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL and ALCL in both adults and children . It is being investigated for use as a combination agent with pre-existing frontline chemotherapies and as a stand-alone salvage therapy for use prior to autologous stem cell transplant . Treatment with brentuximab vedotin is generally well tolerated although it is associated with grade 1-2 adverse reactions such as neutropenia and there have been reports of grade 3-4 serious adverse events . In particular its use with chemotherapy regimens that include bleomycin is contraindicated because of adverse pulmonary effects .
