Aripiprazole : a novel atypical antipsychotic drug with a uniquely robust pharmacology . Aripiprazole ( DB01238 ) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been recently introduced for clinical use in the treatment of schizophrenia . Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacologic profile that includes partial agonism at several G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ especially dopamine ( D2 ) and P08908 ] and antagonistic action at others ( especially 5- Q13049 ) . Clinical trials indicate that aripiprazole is effective in treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . In short-term studies rapid onset of action ( within one week ) has been demonstrated . Preliminary data indicate that aripiprazole may also be effective in the treatment of manic symptoms of bipolar disorder . At recommended doses , aripiprazole appears to be safe and well tolerated in most adult patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . There is only limited information available on the use of aripiprazole in children and adolescents , and pilot data suggest that a revised dosing strategy , based on weight , is indicated in this population . In the long-term studies , the use of aripiprazole was associated with continued efficacy , good compliance and increased time-to-relapse . Aripiprazole represents the first functionally selective atypical antipsychotic drug .
