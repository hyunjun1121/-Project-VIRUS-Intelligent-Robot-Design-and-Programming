P35354 predicts adverse effects of tamoxifen : a possible mechanism of role for nuclear P04626 in breast cancer patients . P35354 ( P35354 ) is associated with breast tumour progression . Clinical and molecular studies implicate human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) in the regulation of P35354 expression . Recent reports raise the possibility that P04626 could mediate these effects through direct transcriptional mechanisms . The relationship between P04626 and P35354 was investigated in a cohort of breast cancer patients with or without endocrine treatment . A tissue microarray comprising tumours from 560 patients with 10-year follow-up was analysed for P04626 , P27361 /2 , polyoma enhancer activator 3 ( P43268 ) and P35354 expression . Subcellular localisation of P04626 was assessed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy . Expression of markers examined was analysed in relation to classic clinicopathological parameters and disease-free survival in the presence and absence of tamoxifen . P35354 expression associated with both membranous and nuclear expression of P04626 ( P=0.0033 and P < 0.00001 respectively ) . No association was detected between P35354 and either P27361 /2 or P43268 ( P=0.7 and P=0.3 respectively ) . None of the markers were found to be independently prognostic . Membrane P04626 , nuclear P04626 and P35354 , however , were all found to predict poor disease-free survival in patients on endocrine treatment ( P=0.0017 , P=0.0003 and P=0.0202 respectively ) . Moreover , patients who were positive for P35354 predicted adverse effects of tamoxifen ( P=0.0427 ) . These clinical ex vivo data are consistent with molecular observations that P04626 can regulate P35354 expression through direct transcriptional mechanisms . P35354 expression correlates with disease progression on endocrine treatment . This study supports a role for P35354 as a predictor of adverse effects of tamoxifen in breast cancer patients .
