DB01169 phosphorylates c-Fos to transactivate P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) expression . An infamous poison , arsenic also has been used as a drug for nearly 2400 years ; in recently years , arsenic has been effective in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia . Increasing evidence suggests that opposite effects of arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) on tumors depend on its concentrations . For this reason , the mechanisms of action of the drug should be elucidated , and it should be used therapeutically only with extreme caution . Previously , we demonstrated the opposing effects of P27361 /2 and JNK on P38936 ( P38936 /CIP1) ( P38936 ) expression in response to ATO in A431 cells . In addition , JNK phosphorylates c-Jun ( DB00133 (63/73) ) to recruit Q15583 / Q13547 to suppress P38936 gene expression . Presently , we demonstrated that a high concentration of ATO sustains P27361 /2 phosphorylation , and increases c-Fos biosynthesis and stability , which enhances P38936 gene expression . Using site-directed mutagenesis , a DNA affinity precipitation assay , and functional assays , we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the C-terminus of c-Fos ( DB00156 (232) , DB00156 (325) , DB00156 (331) , and DB00133 (374) ) plays an important role in its binding to the P38936 promoter , and in conjunction with N-terminus phosphorylation of c-Fos ( DB00133 (70) ) to transactivate P38936 promoter expression . In conclusion , a high concentration of ATO can sustain P27361 /2 activation to enhance c-Fos expression , then dimerize with dephosphorylated c-Jun ( DB00133 (63/73) ) and recruit p300/CBP to the Sp1 sites ( -84/-64 ) to activate P38936 gene expression in A431 cells .
