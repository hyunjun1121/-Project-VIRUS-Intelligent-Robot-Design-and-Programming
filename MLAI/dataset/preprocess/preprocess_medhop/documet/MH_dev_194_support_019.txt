[ Circumventing multidrug resistance in human cancer by anti-ribozyme ] . The demonstration tha RNA can be cleavaged by cis-ribozyme ( catalytic RNAs , RNA enzyme ) has potentially important therapeutic implications . Ribozymes are effective for modulation of gene expression because of their simple structure , site-specific cleavage activity and catalytic potential . The targets of ribozyme-mediated gene modulation have ranged from cancer cells to foreign genes that cause infectious diseases . Additional target sites for ribozymes are in initial phases of development and design . Ribozymes have been targeted against myriad genes , including oncogenes ( ras , P11274 - P00519 ) and drug resistance genes ( MDR-1 , c-fos , P00374 ) . These ribozymes have cleaved the target RNAs in culture system ( in vitro ) and developed in vivo system . We reported that anti-fos ribozyme has altered the expression of c-fos and DNA repair genes in cisplatin-resistance cancer cells , and reversed the sensitivity to ciaplatin . Furthermore , we have developed high efficiency by the transfer system using an electroporation in vivo .
