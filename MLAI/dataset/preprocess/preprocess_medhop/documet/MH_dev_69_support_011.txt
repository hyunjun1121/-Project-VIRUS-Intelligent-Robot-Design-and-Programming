A common variant in P35462 gene is associated with risperidone-induced extrapyramidal symptoms . We present a pharmacogenetic study of acute antipsychotic ( AP ) -induced extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) using an extensive linkage disequilibrium mapping approach in seven-candidate genes with a well-established link to dopamine ( P14416 , P35462 , P12821 , P21964 , Q01959 , P21397 , P27338 ) . From a cohort of 321 psychiatric inpatients , 81 cases presenting with EPS ( Simpson-Angus > 3 ) and 189 controls presenting without EPS ( Simpson-Angus < or = 3 ) took part . Eighty-four-tag single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in candidate genes were genotyped . After extensive data cleaning , 70 SNPs were analyzed for association of single markers and haplotypes . AP dosage , AP- P14416 blockade potency and age were identified as susceptibility factors for AP-induced EPS . One SNP of the P35462 gene , rs167771 , achieved significant association with EPS risk after Bonferroni correction ( nominal P-value 1.3 x 10(-4) ) in the patients treated with risperidone ( 132 patients ) . AP-induced EPS remains a serious public health problem . Our finding of a common SNP ( rs167771 ) in the P35462 gene provides a strong new candidate gene for risperidone-induced EPS .
