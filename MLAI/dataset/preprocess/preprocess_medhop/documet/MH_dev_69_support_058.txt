Sustained increase of PKA activity in the postcommissural putamen of dyskinetic monkeys . Levodopa-induced dyskinesias ( LID ) are a frequent complication of Parkinson 's disease pharmacotherapy that causes significant disability and narrows the therapeutic window . Pharmacological management of LID is challenging partly because the precise molecular mechanisms are not completely understood . Here , our aim was to determine molecular changes that could unveil targetable mechanisms underlying this drug complication . We examined the expression and downstream activity of dopamine receptors ( DR ) in the striatum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropiridine ( MPTP ) -lesioned monkeys with and without DB01235 treatment . Four monkeys were made dyskinetic and other four received a shorter course of DB01235 and did not develop LID . Our results show that DB01235 treatment induces an increase in P14416 and P35462 expression in the postcommissural putamen , but only P35462 is correlated with the severity of LID . Dyskinetic monkeys show a hyperactivation of the canonical P21728 -signaling pathway , measured by an increased phosphorylation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) and its substrates , particularly Q9UD71 . In contrast , activation of the P14416 -signaling pathway , visible in the levels of Akt phosphorylated on Thr308 and GSK3Î² on Ser9 , is associated with DB01235 treatment , independently of the presence of dyskinesias . Our data clearly demonstrate that dyskinetic monkeys present a dysregulation of the P35462 receptor and the P21728 pathway with a sustained increase of PKA activity in the postcommissural putamen . Importantly , we found that all signaling changes related to long-term DB01235 administration are exquisitely restricted to the postcommissural putamen , which may be related to the recurrent failure of pharmacological approaches .
