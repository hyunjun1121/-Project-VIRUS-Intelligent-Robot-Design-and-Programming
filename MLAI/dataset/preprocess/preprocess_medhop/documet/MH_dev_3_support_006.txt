NO-donor P35354 inhibitors . New nitrooxy-substituted 1,5-diarylimidazoles endowed with P35354 inhibitory and vasodilator properties . A series of NO-donor diarylimidazoles derived from the lead compound DB05095 were synthesized and evaluated for their P35354 inhibitory activity and their stability in whole blood as well as for vasodilator properties . The products are partly transformed into the corresponding alcohols following 24-h incubation in whole blood . All of them display good P23219 / P35354 selectivity , but are less potent than the lead ; a molecular modeling study was carried out to investigate their binding mode . The compounds are also capable of relaxing rat aorta strips precontracted with phenylephrine with a NO-dependent mechanism ; this property could confer reduced cardiotoxicity with respect to traditional P35354 inhibitors .
