Innovative approaches for the development of antidepressant drugs : current and future strategies . Depression is a highly debilitating disorder that has been estimated to affect up to 21 % of the world population . Despite the advances in the treatment of depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , there continue to be many unmet clinical needs with respect to both efficacy and side effects . These needs range from efficacy in treatment resistant patients , to improved onset , to reductions in side effects such as emesis or sexual dysfunction . To address these needs , there are numerous combination therapies and novel targets that have been identified that may demonstrate improvements in one or more areas . There is tremendous diversity in the types of targets and approaches being taken . At one end of a spectrum is combination therapies that maintain the benefits associated with SSRIs but attempt to either improve efficacy or reduce side effects by adding additional mechanisms ( P08908 , P28222 , P28221 , P28335 , alpha-2A ) . At the other end of the spectrum are more novel targets , such as neurotrophins ( P23560 , IGF ) , based on recent findings that antidepressants induce neurogenesis . In between , there are many approaches that range from directly targeting serotonin receptors ( P28335 , P50406 ) to targeting the multiplicity of potential mechanisms associated with excitatory ( glutamate , DB01221 , Q14416 , P41594 ) or inhibitory amino acid systems ( GABA ) or peptidergic systems ( neurokinin 1 , DB05394 1 , melanin-concentrating hormone 1 , V1b ) . The present review addresses the most exciting approaches and reviews the localization , neurochemical and behavioral data that provide the supporting rationale for each of these targets or target combinations .
