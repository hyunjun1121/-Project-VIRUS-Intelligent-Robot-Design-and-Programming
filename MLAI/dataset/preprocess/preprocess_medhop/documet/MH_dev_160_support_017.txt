Open-label trial of anti- P01375 in dermato- and polymyositis treated concomitantly with methotrexate . BACKGROUND/AIMS : To determine the efficacy of infliximab combined with weekly methotrexate in drug-naive recent-onset dermatomyositis and polymyositis . METHODS : A multicentre open-label controlled trial was conducted . Disease activity was assessed using patient 's and physician 's disease activity assessment , manual muscle testing ( MMT ) , handheld dynamometry , and serum CK . The primary objective was to assess the efficacy using MMT after a period of 26 weeks . RESULTS : The study was terminated prematurely because of a low inclusion rate and a high drop-out rate due to disease progression and the occurrence of an infusion reaction . The few patients who did reach the primary endpoint showed improvement in all aspects studied . CONCLUSION : DB00065 combined with weekly methotrexate might be safe and well tolerated in a small subgroup of patients with drug-naive recent-onset myositis . At present , we do not advocate the use of this treatment because treatment response can not be predicted beforehand .
