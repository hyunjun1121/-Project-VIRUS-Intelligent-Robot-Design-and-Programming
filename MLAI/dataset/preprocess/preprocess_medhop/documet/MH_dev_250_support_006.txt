[ DB01407 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. No indication for a positive effect ] . The anabolic effects of clenbuterol have been recognized for a long time . DB01407 augments the expression of specific muscle proteins with a differential effect on type I and type II fibres . Furthermore , clenbuterol induces the synthesis of endogenous nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) and may itself be a myotrophic factor released by neuron endings . Side effects include tremor and headache and dose dependent abnormalities of laboratory values ( hypokalemia , hypoglycemia ) . After long-term medication increasing fatigue of muscles has been observed . Decreased expression of beta 2-adrenergic receptors may limit the expected functional improvement . The efficacy of clenbuterol as symptomatic treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has not been proved . Controlled treatment trials are warranted to assess this question .
