Costimulation blockade in autoimmunity and transplantation . Signaling through the costimulation receptors is a critical pathway in the regulation of T-cell activation . The selective costimulation inhibitor abatacept ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-Ig ) binds to P33681 and P42081 on antigen-presenting cells , blocking interaction with P10747 on T cells , and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis . DB06681 ( DB06681 ) , currently enrolling phase III trials in renal transplantation , was rationally designed from abatacept to bind with more avidity to P42081 , providing the more potent immunosuppressive properties required for immunosuppression in transplantation . This review describes the relevant preclinical studies and summarizes recent clinical findings on these 2 molecules in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation . Although both inhibit the P10747 costimulatory pathway , they are tailored for specific disease states -- abatacept for autoimmune diseases and belatacept for transplantation .
