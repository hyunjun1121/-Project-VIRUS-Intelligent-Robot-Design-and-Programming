Differential functional activity of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor ligands and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor sites in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts and opossum renal epithelial cells . Functional activity of 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) receptor ligands and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists was studied at P28222 receptor sites in Chinese hamster lung ( CHL ) fibroblasts by measuring two cellular responses : inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation and potentiation of basic fibroblast growth ( BFGF ) induced mitogenesis . A good correlation was found between the potency of agonists to inhibit forskolin-induced cyclic AMP formation and their potency to potentiate P09038 -induced thymidine incorporation in CHL fibroblasts . Potent agonist activity was measured with 5-methoxy-3,1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyidinyl- 1H-indole ( RU 24,969 ) , 5-carboxamidotryptamine ( 5-CT ) , 3-(1,2,5,6)-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl-5-pyrrolo(3,2-b)pyril-5-one ( CP 93,129 ) and 5-HT , whereas sumatriptan displayed weak agonist activity at concentrations different from its binding affinity for P28222 binding sites . In contrast to the observed P28222 receptor-mediated agonist activity in opossum kidney cells for metergoline and the beta adrenergic receptor antagonists : cyanopindolol , 4-(3-tert-butyl-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-indole-2 carbonic acid isopropyl ester ( SDZ 21,009 ) , isamoltane , (-)-propranolol and (-)-pindolol , antagonist activity at P28222 receptor sites was yielded in CHL fibroblasts in accordance with the reported observations at rat brain P28222 receptors . Methiothepin was the only compound that antagonized both the opossum kidney cell and CHL fibroblast P28222 receptor-mediated responses although the antagonist effect was more pronounced in CHL fibroblasts.
