Regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by heat : a novel aspect of heat shock factor 1 function in human cells . The heat-shock response , a fundamental defense mechanism against proteotoxic stress , is regulated by a family of heat-shock transcription factors ( HSF ) . In humans Q00613 is considered the central regulator of heat-induced transcriptional responses . The main targets for Q00613 are specific promoter elements ( HSE ) located upstream of heat-shock genes encoding cytoprotective heat-shock proteins ( HSP ) with chaperone function . In addition to its cytoprotective function , Q00613 was recently hypothesized to play a more complex role , regulating the expression of non-HSP genes ; however , the non-canonical role of Q00613 is still poorly understood . Herein we report that heat-stress promotes the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , a key regulator of inflammation controlling prostanoid and thromboxane synthesis , resulting in the production of high levels of prostaglandin-E(2) in human cells . We show that heat-induced P35354 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level via Q00613 -mediated signaling and identify , by in-vitro reporter gene activity assay and deletion-mutant constructs analysis , the P35354 heat-responsive promoter region and a new distal cis-acting HSE located at position -2495 from the transcription start site . As shown by ChIP analysis , Q00613 is recruited to the P35354 promoter rapidly after heat treatment ; by using shRNA-mediated Q00613 suppression and HSE-deletion from the P35354 promoter , we demonstrate that Q00613 plays a central role in the transcriptional control of P35354 by heat . Finally , P35354 transcription is also induced at febrile temperatures in endothelial cells , suggesting that Q00613 -dependent P35354 expression could contribute to increasing blood prostaglandin levels during fever . The results identify P35354 as a human non-classical heat-responsive gene , unveiling a new aspect of Q00613 function .
