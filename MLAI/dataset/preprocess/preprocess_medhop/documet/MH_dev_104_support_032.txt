Coactivation of DB01221 receptors by glutamate and D-serine induces dilation of isolated middle cerebral arteries . N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptors are glutamate-gated cation channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system . In addition to glutamate , DB01221 receptors are also activated by coagonist binding of the gliotransmitter , D-serine . Neuronal DB01221 receptors mediate activity-dependent blood flow regulation in the brain . Our objective was to determine whether DB01221 receptors expressed by brain endothelial cells can induce vasodilation of isolated brain arteries . Adult mouse middle cerebral arteries ( MCAs ) were isolated , pressurized , and preconstricted with norepinephrine . N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists , glutamate and DB01221 , significantly dilated MCAs in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of D-serine but not alone . Dilation was significantly inhibited by DB01221 receptor antagonists , D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate and 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid , indicating a response dependent on DB01221 receptor glutamate and D-serine binding sites , respectively . Vasodilation was inhibited by denuding the endothelium and by selective inhibition or genetic knockout of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) . We also found evidence for expression of the pan- DB01221 receptor subunit , Q9UHB4 , in mouse primary brain endothelial cells , and for the DB01221 receptor subunit Q14957 in cortical arteries in situ . Overall , we conclude that DB01221 receptor coactivation by glutamate and D-serine increases lumen diameter in pressurized MCA in an endothelial and P29474 -dependent mechanism .
