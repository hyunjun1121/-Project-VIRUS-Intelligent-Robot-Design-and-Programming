Comparative characterization of lung muscarinic receptor binding after intratracheal administration of tiotropium , ipratropium , and glycopyrrolate . The aim of the current study was to characterize comparatively the binding of muscarinic receptor in the lung of rats intratracheally administered anticholinergic agents ( tiotropium , ipratropium , glycopyrrolate ) used clinically to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) and asthma . Binding parameters of [N-methyl-(3)H]scopolamine methyl chloride ( [(3)H] Q5H8A3 ) were determined in tissues ( lung , bladder , submaxillary gland ) of rats intratracheally administered tiotropium , ipratropium , and glycopyrrolate . The in vitro binding affinity of tiotropium for the receptors was 10-11-fold higher than those of ipratropium and glycopyrrolate . Intratracheal administration of tiotropium ( 0.6-6.4 nmol/kg ) caused sustained ( lasting at least 24 h ) increase in the apparent dissociation constant ( K(d) ) for [(3)H] Q5H8A3 binding in rat lung compared with the control value . Concomitantly , there was a long-lasting decrease in the maximal number of binding sites ( B(max) ) for [(3)H] Q5H8A3 . Similary , ipratropium and glycopyrrolate at 7.3 and 7.5 nmol/kg , respectively , brought about a significant increase in K(d) for [(3)H] Q5H8A3 binding . The effect by ipratropium was observed at 2 h but not 12 h , and that by glycopyrrolate lasted for 24 h . Both agents had little influence on the muscarinic receptors in the bladder and submaxillary gland . The present study provides the first evidence that tiotropium , ipratropium , and glycopyrrolate administered intratracheally in rats selectively bound muscarinic receptors of the lung , and tiotropium and glycopyrrolate had a much longer-lasting effect than ipratropium .
