Q9Y251 -mediated loss of nuclear syndecan-1 enhances histone acetyltransferase ( O60235 ) activity to promote expression of genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype . Q9Y251 acts as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype in part by enhancing expression of proteins known to drive tumor progression ( e.g. P15692 , P14780 , hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) , and O14788 ) . However , the mechanism whereby this enzyme regulates gene expression remains unknown . We previously reported that elevation of heparanase levels in myeloma cells causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of syndecan-1 in the nucleus . Because syndecan-1 has heparan sulfate chains and because exogenous heparan sulfate has been shown to inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase ( O60235 ) enzymes in vitro , we hypothesized that the reduction in nuclear syndecan-1 in cells expressing high levels of heparanase would result in increased O60235 activity leading to stimulation of protein transcription . We found that myeloma cells or tumors expressing high levels of heparanase and low levels of nuclear syndecan-1 had significantly higher levels of O60235 activity when compared with cells or tumors expressing low levels of heparanase . High levels of O60235 activity in heparanase-high cells were blocked by SST0001 , an inhibitor of heparanase . Restoration of high syndecan-1 levels in heparanase-high cells diminished nuclear O60235 activity , establishing syndecan-1 as a potent inhibitor of O60235 . Exposure of heparanase-high cells to anacardic acid , an inhibitor of O60235 activity , significantly suppressed their expression of P15692 and P14780 , two genes known to be up-regulated following elevation of heparanase . These results reveal a novel mechanistic pathway driven by heparanase expression , which leads to decreased nuclear syndecan-1 , increased O60235 activity , and up-regulation of transcription of multiple genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype .
