Growth-inhibitory effects of vitamin D analogues and retinoids on human pancreatic cancer cells . Retinoids and vitamin D are important factors that regulate cellular growth and differentiation . An additive growth-inhibitory effect of retinoids and vitamin D analogues has been demonstrated for human myeloma , leukaemic and breast cancer cells . We set out to study the effects of the vitamin D analogue EB1089 and the retinoids all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid on the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines Capan 1 and Capan 2 and the undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma cell line Hs766T . The cell lines investigated expressed vitamin D receptor , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) -alpha and gamma as determined by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription . P10826 was expressed only in Hs766T cells . Addition of all-trans-retinoic acid increased the amount of P10276 mRNA in the three cell lines and induced P10826 mRNA in Capan 1 and Capan 2 cells . All-trans-retinoic acid at a concentration of 10 nM inhibited the growth of Capan 1 and Capan 2 cells by 40 % relative to controls . DB00523 was less effective . Neither all-trans-retinoic acid nor 9-cis-retinoic acid affected the growth of Hs766T cells . EB1089 , if added alone to the cells , did not significantly inhibit growth . However , the combination of 1 nM EB1089 with 10 nM all-trans-retinoic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect of 90 % in Capan 1 cells and of 70 % in Capan 2 cells . Our data suggest that vitamin D analogues together with retinoids inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells . However , in vivo studies are necessary to examine the potential use of retinoids and vitamin D analogues on pancreatic cancer .
