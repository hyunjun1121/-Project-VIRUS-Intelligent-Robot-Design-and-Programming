A novel mechanism of autophagic cell death in dystrophic muscle regulated by Q99572 receptor large-pore formation and HSP90 . Q99572 is an DB00171 -gated ion channel , which can also exhibit an open state with a considerably wider permeation . However , the functional significance of the movement of molecules through the large pore ( LP ) and the intracellular signaling events involved are not known . Here , analyzing the consequences of Q99572 activation in primary myoblasts and myotubes from the Dmd(mdx) mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy , we found DB00171 -induced Q99572 -dependent autophagic flux , leading to P42574 - P55210 -independent cell death . Q99572 -evoked autophagy was triggered by LP formation but not Ca(2+) influx or P28482 - P27361 phosphorylation , 2 canonical Q99572 -evoked signals . Phosphoproteomics , protein expression inference and signaling pathway prediction analysis of Q99572 signaling mediators pointed to P54652 and HSP90 proteins . Indeed , specific HSP90 inhibitors prevented LP formation , LC3-II accumulation , and cell death in myoblasts and myotubes but not in macrophages . Pharmacological blockade or genetic ablation of p2rx7 also proved protective against DB00171 -induced death of muscle cells , as did inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA . The functional significance of the Q99572 LP is one of the great unknowns of purinergic signaling . Our data demonstrate a novel outcome -- autophagy -- and show that molecules entering through the LP can be targeted to phagophores . Moreover , we show that in muscles but not in macrophages , autophagy is needed for the formation of this LP . Given that Q99572 -dependent LP and HSP90 are critically interacting in the DB00171 -evoked autophagic death of dystrophic muscles , treatments targeting this axis could be of therapeutic benefit in this debilitating and incurable form of muscular dystrophy .
