Beta2-adrenergic receptor signaling in P01730 + Foxp3+ regulatory T cells enhances their suppressive function in a PKA-dependent manner . Beta2-adrenergic receptor ( P07550 ) signaling is known to impair Th1-cell differentiation and function in a DB02527 -dependent way , leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and decreased production of P60568 and IFN-Î³ . P01730 (+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells play a key role in the regulation of immune responses and are essential for maintenance of self-tolerance . Nevertheless , very little is known about adrenergic receptor expression in Treg cells or the influence of noradrenaline on their function . Here we show that Foxp3(+) Treg cells express functional P07550 . P07550 activation in Treg cells leads to increased intracellular DB02527 levels and to protein kinase A ( PKA ) -dependent CREB phosphorylation . We also found that signaling via P07550 enhances the in vitro suppressive activity of Treg cells . P07550 -mediated increase in Treg-cell suppressive function was associated with decreased P60568 mRNA levels in responder P01730 (+) T cells and improved Treg-cell-induced conversion of P01730 (+) Foxp3(-) cells into Foxp3(+) induced Treg cells . Moreover , P07550 signaling increased P16410 expression in Treg cells in a PKA-dependent way . Finally , we found that PKA inhibition totally prevented the P07550 -mediated increase in Treg-cell suppressive function . Our data suggest that sympathetic fibers are able to regulate Treg-cell suppressive activity in a positive manner through P07550 signaling .
