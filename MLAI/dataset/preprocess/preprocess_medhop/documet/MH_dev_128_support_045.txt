Interplay between inhibitory ferric and stimulatory curcumin regulates phosphorylation-dependent human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and ΔF508 activity . Curcumin potentiates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) activation in an DB00171 -independent but phosphorylation-dependent manner . The underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear . Here , P29320 -293T cells cultured in an Fe(3+)-containing medium were transiently transfected with P13569 constructs , and the role of the inhibitory Fe(3+) bridge between intracellular loop 3 and the regulatory domain of P13569 in this pathway was investigated . The results showed that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( DB00974 ) stimulated phosphorylation-dependent P13569 activation and the stimulation was suppressed by the deletion of the regulatory domain or the insertion of a C832A mutation that removes the Fe(3+)-binding interface . Furthermore , curcumin potentiation of P13569 was significantly weakened not only by Fe(3+)-insensitive mutations at the interface between the regulatory domain and intracellular loop 3 but also by N-ethylmaleimide or DB00974 pretreatment that removes Fe(3+) . More importantly , potentiation of P13569 was completely suppressed by sufficient Fe(3+) . Finally , the insertion of Fe(3+)-insensitive H950R/S768R increased the curcumin-independent activity of ΔF508 but weakened its curcumin potentiation . Thus , Fe(3+) homeostasis in epithelia may play a critical role in regulating P13569 activity , and targeting Fe(3+)-chelating potentiators may direct new therapies for cystic fibrosis .
