DB01590 prolonged survival in transgenic mice with P00533 -driven lung tumors . DB01590 is an orally administered P42345 inhibitor . The effect , and mechanism of action , of everolimus on lung cancers with an epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) mutation remain unclear . Four gefitinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines were used in the present work . Growth inhibition was determined using the MTT assay . Transgenic mice carrying the P00533 L858R mutation were treated with everolimus ( 10 mg/kg/day ) , or vehicle alone , from 5 to 20 weeks of age , and were then sacrificed . To evaluate the efficacy of everolimus in prolonging survival , everolimus ( 10 mg/kg/day ) or vehicle was administered from 5 weeks of age . The four cell lines were similarly sensitive to everolimus . Expression of phosphorylated ( p ) P42345 and pS6 were suppressed upon treatment with everolimus in vitro , whereas the pAKT level increased . The numbers of lung tumors with a long axis exceeding 1mm in the everolimus-treated and control groups were 1.9 ± 0.9 and 9.4 ± 3.2 ( t-test , p < 0.001 ) , respectively . pS6 was suppressed during eve r olimus treatment . Although apoptosis and autophagy were not induced in everolimus-treated P00533 transgenic mice , angiogenesis was suppressed . The median survival time in the everolimus-treated group ( 58.0 weeks ) was significantly longer than that in the control group ( 31.2 weeks ) ( logrank test , p < 0.001 ) . These findings suggest that everolimus had an indirect effect on tumor formation by inhibiting angiogenesis and might be effective to treat lung tumors induced by an activating P00533 gene mutation .
