Fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) development and activation as a determinant of the timing of birth , and of postnatal disease . Birth in most animal species is triggered by the fetus through activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis . Preterm birth , may be associated with precocious activation of fetal Q9Y251 function , reflecting the fetal response to an adverse intrauterine environment . There is a progressive and concurrent increase of ACTH1-39 and cortisol ( F ) in the circulation of fetal sheep during the last 15-20 days of pregnancy ( term , day 145-150 ) associated with increased expression of hypothalamic P06850 pituitary P01189 and adrenal Q01718 and steroidogenic enzymes , particularly P450 C17 . Similar changes occur with fetal hypoxemia . Negative feedback is ameliorated by decreased pituitary and hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor , increased CBG , and altered fetal pituitary 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 . Repeated fetal hypoxemia , diminishes the fetal-pituitary DB01285 response , but increases fetal adrenal responsiveness . Fetuses exposed to maternal glucocorticoid in late gestation are growth restricted with altered postnatal Q9Y251 responsiveness and glycemic responses that reproduce the insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes . We conclude that the level of fetal Q9Y251 activity is crucial not only for determining gestation length , but also predicts pathophysiologic adjustment in later life .
