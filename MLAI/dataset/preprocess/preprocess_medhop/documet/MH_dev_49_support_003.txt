Effects of maternal smoking on the placental expression of genes related to angiogenesis and apoptosis during the first trimester . OBJECTIVE : Maternal cigarette smoking is reportedly associated with miscarriage , fetal growth restriction and placental abruption , and is paradoxically associated with a decreased risk of developing preeclampsia . In the present study , we investigated the gene expression levels of villous tissues in early gestation . We compared the expression levels of the genes related to angiogenesis and apoptosis in the villous tissues obtained from smoking and non-smoking pregnant women . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We collected villous tissue samples from 57 women requesting surgical termination due to non-medical reasons at 6-8 weeks of gestation . The maternal cigarette smoking status was evaluated by the level of serum cotinine and patients were divided into active smokers and non-smokers by the serum cotinine level . The placental levels of P15692 , P49763 , P17948 , Q16665 , P04637 , Q07812 and P10415 mRNA were quantified by real time PCR . RESULTS : The gene expression level of P49763 and Q16665 in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group . We did not observe any significant differences in the P15692 or P17948 expression between the groups . In active smoker group , the gene expression levels of P04637 and Q07812 were significantly higher than those in the non-smoker group . The ratio of Q07812 / P10415 mRNA in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings revealed that smoking might affect the placenta during early pregnancy . Maternal cigarette smoking in early pregnancy may be associated with villus hypoxia , which may influence angiogenesis and apoptosis .
