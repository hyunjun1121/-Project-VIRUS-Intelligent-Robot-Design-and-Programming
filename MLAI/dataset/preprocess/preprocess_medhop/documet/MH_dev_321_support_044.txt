Effect of axitinib ( AG-013736 ) on fatigue , thyroid-stimulating hormone , and biomarkers : a phase I study in Japanese patients . DB06626 is an oral , potent , and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) 1 , 2 , and 3 . This phase I study evaluated the safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , antitumor activity , and recommended starting dose of axitinib in patients with advanced solid tumors . Twelve patients received single-dose axitinib 5 mg and were monitored for > or =48 h . Continuous 5 mg twice-daily dosing was then initiated . One patient had dose-limiting toxicity ( grade 3 proteinuria and fatigue ) . Common treatment-related adverse events were anorexia , fatigue , and diarrhea . Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue and hypertension . Maximum axitinib plasma concentration occurred 1-4 h after steady-state dosing . Eleven patients experienced thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation ; time-course change and fatigue onset appeared to be related in some patients . Significant correlation was observed between thyroid-stimulating hormone change and area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ; r = 0.80 , P = 0.005 ) . DB06626 decreased plasma soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( s- P35968 ) , with significant correlation between change in s- P35968 and AUC ( r = -0.92 , P < 0.0001 ) . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed a substantial decrease in tumor metabolic activity associated with axitinib . Tumor size decreased in nine patients . The time-course of thyroid-stimulating hormone change appeared correlated with fatigue . There were significant correlations between thyroid-stimulating hormone or s- P35968 and axitinib exposure . DB06626 5 mg twice-daily is the recommended starting dose for Japanese patients . This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT00447005 .
