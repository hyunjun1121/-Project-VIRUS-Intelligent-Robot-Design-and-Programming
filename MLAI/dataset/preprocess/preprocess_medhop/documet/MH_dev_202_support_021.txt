Characterization of antihistamines using biphasic cutaneous reaction in BALB/c mice . Effects of 11 histamine H1 receptor antagonists on IgE-mediated biphasic cutaneous reaction in mice were examined . The immediate phase reaction ( IPR ) assessed at 1 hour after antigen application was significantly inhibited by all antihistamines examined . The inhibition of IPR by cetirizine and mequitazine were potent , but those by cyproheptadine and diphenhydramine were weak . The later phase reaction ( LPR ) assessed at 24 hours after antigen application was inhibited by chlorpheniramine , oxatomide , ketotifen , mequitazine , emedastine , terfenadine and azelastine . The inhibition of LPR by emedastine was potent , but those by ketotifen and terfenadine were only partial . DB01084 inhibited both IPR and LPR comparably . Present results indicate that H1 receptor activation is involved in the IPR of the biphasic cutaneous reaction , and that the blockade of H1 receptors at IPR does not contribute to the attenuation of following LPR . P35367 antagonists inhibiting the LPR have a property distinct from H1 receptor antagonism , which may have an additional benefit for the treatment of allergic diseases .
