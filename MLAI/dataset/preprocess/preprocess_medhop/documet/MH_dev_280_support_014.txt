Targeted therapies for adrenocortical carcinoma : IGF and beyond . Standard chemotherapy for adrenocortical cancer currently is under evaluation in the context of the recently completed FIRM-ACT evaluating the combination of mitotane with either streptozocin or etoposide , cisplatin , and doxorubicin . New agents are eagerly sought by the ACC community that hopes to make progress against this deadly disease . Investigators have begun to dissect the molecular and genomic context of ACC with a goal of identifying potential novel therapeutic agents . One gene consistently overexpressed in ACC is insulin growth factor type 2 . Targeting its receptor P08069 has shown encouraging results in ACC cell lines and against murine xenografts . As a result , clinical trials to evaluate agents targeting the P08069 have been done including mitotane and DB05759 ( a monoclonal antibody ) and the GALACCTIC trial that has just completed accrual to evaluate OSI-906 , a small molecule P08069 antagonist . On the horizon are other agents targeting other tyrosine kinases , including P01133 and FGF , and novel strategies such as individualized tumor analysis to select treatment .
