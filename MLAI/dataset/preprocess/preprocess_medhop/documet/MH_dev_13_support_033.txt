[ Progress in locating the genetic causes of schizophrenia ] . Elucidation of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is progressing rapidly . The importance of the glutamatergic system and the glutamate receptor Q14832 were shown in both genetic and pharmacological studies of the new drug DB05096 . The zinc finger domain-containing gene Q7Z570 could be identified as a new schizophrenia susceptibility gene , while large copy number variants at 1q21.1 and 15q13.3 now are seen as monogenic causes of schizophrenia .
