DB00227 , a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , induces apoptosis and differentiation in human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells . Although only 1 % of differentiated thyroid cancers transform into anaplastic thyroid cancer , this disease is always fatal . Differentiation therapy may provide a new therapeutic approach to increasing the survival rate in such patients . 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG- DB01992 ) reductase inhibitors are reported to promote cellular apoptosis and differentiation in many cancer cells ; these effects are unrelated to lipid reduction . Recently , we found that TNFalpha induces cytomorphological differentiation in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells and increases thyroglobulin expression ; however , P01375 is cytotoxic for normal human tissue . The aim of this study was to determine whether lovastatin , an P04035 inhibitor , could induce apoptosis and differentiation in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells . Anaplastic thyroid cancer cells were treated with lovastatin , then examined for cellular apoptosis and cytomorphological differentiation by DNA fragmentation , phosphatidylserine externalization/flow cytometry , and electron microscopy . Thyroglobulin levels in the culture medium were also measured . Our results showed that at a higher dose ( 50 micro M ) , lovastatin induced apoptosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells , whereas at a lower dose ( 25 micro M ) , it promoted 3-dimensional cytomorphological differentiation . It also induced increased secretion of thyroglobulin by anaplastic cancer cells . Our results show that lovastatin not only induces apoptosis , but also promotes redifferentiation in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells , and suggest that it and other P04035 inhibitors merit further investigation as differentiation therapy for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer .
