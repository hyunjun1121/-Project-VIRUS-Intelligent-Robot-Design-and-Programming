[ Network pharmacology study on major active compounds of Fufang Danshen formula ] . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the correlations between multi-compounds of Fufang Danshen formula and their multi targets and multi diseases . METHOD : Literature knowledge of nine major active compounds from Fufang Danshen formula , including tanshinone II(A) , salvianolic acid B , protocatechuic aldehyde , danshensu , cryptotanshinone , notoginsenoside Q96GN5 , ginsenoside Rg1 , DB06749 and borneol were collected from PubMed . Combined with cardiovascular related diseases and genes from OMIM database , the corresponding multi-compound-multi- target-multi-disease network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape software . RESULT : AND CONCLUSION : Network analysis showed that the 9 compounds could modulate 42 cardiovascular associated genes ( e. g. P37231 , P12821 , Q14654 , P51787 , Q09428 , et al ) , which related to 30 cardiovascular associated diseases including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia , hypertension , and coronary heart disease . These results suggested new potential indications of Fufang Danshen formula .
