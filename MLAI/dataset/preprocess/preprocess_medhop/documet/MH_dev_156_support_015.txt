Roles of thromboxane A(2) and prostacyclin in the development of atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice . Production of thromboxane ( TX ) A2 and PG I2/prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) is increased in patients with atherosclerosis . However , their roles in atherogenesis have not been critically defined . To examine this issue , we cross-bred atherosclerosis-prone apoE-deficient mice with mice deficient in either the TXA receptor ( TP ) or the P43119 ( IP ) . Although they showed levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride similar to those of apoE-deficient mice , apoE-/-TP-/- mice exhibited a significant delay in atherogenesis , and apoE-/-IP-/- mice exhibited a significant acceleration in atherogenesis compared with mice deficient in apoE alone . The plaques in apoE-/-IP-/- mice showed partial endothelial disruption and exhibited enhanced expression of P05362 and decreased expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( P16284 ) in the overlying endothelial cells compared with those of apoE-/-TP-/- mice . Platelet activation with thrombin ex vivo revealed higher and lower sensitivity for surface P16109 expression in platelets of apoE-/-IP-/- and apoE-/-TP-/- mice , respectively , than in those of apoE-/- mice . Intravital microscopy of the common carotid artery revealed a significantly greater number of leukocytes rolling on the vessel walls in apoE-/-IP-/- mice than in either apoE-/-TP-/- or apoE-/- mice . We conclude that TXA2 promotes and DB01240 prevents the initiation and progression of atherogenesis through control of platelet activation and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction .
