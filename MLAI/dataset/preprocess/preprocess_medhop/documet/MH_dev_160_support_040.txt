DB00065 for treatment of resistant pyoderma gangrenosum associated with Crohn 's disease . We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with Crohn 's disease manifested by diffuse abdominal pain , bloody diarrhea accompanied by arthralgia , and swelling of large joints . On the lateral aspect of her right ankle there was an hemorrhagic , necrotic bullous lesion measuring 3 x 4 cm , surrounded by cutaneous inflammation and erythema . Biopsy showed a neutrophilic abscess-like ulcerative skin inflammation , which was diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum . The patient was treated with high doses of parenteral methylprednisolone , but her condition failed to improve and infliximab , a P01375 blocking agent , was instituted . An immediate response of Crohn 's disease was observed and , over the next 5 weeks , the ulcer on her right ankle also healed completely .
