Predictive molecular markers : has the time come for routine use in lung cancer ? Although some evidence exists to support the use of clinical factors such as performance status and weight loss to predict response and toxicity to therapy in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients , researchers have shown little prospective data on the use of molecular markers to facilitate selection of specific chemotherapy or new molecularly targeted agents in this patient population . Breast cancer exemplifies the growing role that molecular markers are playing , not only as prognostic factors , but also in predicting response to targeted treatments such as hormonal therapy , and more recently , trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) . Although several studies have examined molecular markers in lung cancer and have shown promising potential value , these studies were retrospective and require prospective validation . To identify molecular markers that reliably predict response and to be able to individualize cytotoxic and targeted therapy for NSCLC patients are the ultimate goals of future trials . This article focuses on a selected number of promising markers under study in lung cancer , including those thought to play roles in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy ( excision repair cross-complementing [ P07992 ] , xeroderma pigmentosum group D [ P18074 ] ) , taxane resistance ( beta-tubulin III ) , antimetabolite therapy ( P23921 ) , irinotecan metabolism ( P22309 ) and epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) pathway inhibition . To date , none of these markers can be recommended for routine use in clinical practice .
