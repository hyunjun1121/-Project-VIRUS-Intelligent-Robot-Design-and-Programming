Hypoxia-induced neuroinflammatory white-matter injury reduced by minocycline in SHR/SP . Hypertensive small vessel disease is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) . Spontaneously hypertensive/stroke prone rats ( SHR/SP ) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion ( UCAO ) and a Japanese permissive diet ( JPD ) have white-matter ( WM ) damage similar to that seen in VCI . We hypothesized that WM injury was due to hypoxia-mediated , blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) disruption . Twelve-week-old SHR/SP had UCAO/JPD and were studied with immunohistochemistry , biochemistry , multimodal magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) , and Morris water maze ( MWM ) testing . One week after UCAO/JPD , WM showed a significant increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) , which increased further by 3 weeks . Prolyl hydroxylase-2 ( Q9GZT9 ) expression decreased at 1 and 3 weeks . Infiltrating T cells and neutrophils appeared around endothelial cells from 1 to 3 weeks after UCAO/JPD , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) colocalized with inflammatory cells . At 3 weeks , WM immunostained for IgG , indicating BBB leakage . DB01017 ( 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally ) was given every other day from weeks 12 to 20 . Multimodal Q9BWK5 showed that treatment with minocycline significantly reduced lesion size and improved cerebral blood flow . DB01017 improved performance in the MWM and prolonged survival . We propose that BBB disruption occurred secondary to hypoxia , which induced an P14780 -mediated infiltration of leukocytes . DB01017 significantly reduced WM damage , improved behavior , and prolonged life .
