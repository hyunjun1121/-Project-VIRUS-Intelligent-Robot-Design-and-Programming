Effects of the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 1 or 2 or P09917 on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis induced by interleukin-1beta in the male Rat . The limited entry of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) into the central nervous system has led to the hypothesis that IL-1beta acts , through IL-1beta receptors located notably on endothelial cells , on the release of prostaglandins which in turn stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis . We used cyclo-oxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) inhibitors , before the injection of IL-1beta , to explore the role of arachidonic acid metabolic pathways on Q9Y251 axis activation . Adult male rats were i.m injected 20 min before i.p injection of IL-1beta , with ( i ) : a P23219 / P35354 inhibitor ( ketoprofen ) ; ( ii ) a P35354 selective inhibitor ( NS 398 ) ; or ( iii ) a 5- P28300 inhibitor ( BW A4C ) . Following this , rats were killed 90 min after i.p . IL-1beta injection and analysis for plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone ( DB01285 ) and corticosterone concentrations and determination of anterior pituitary pro-opio melanocortin ( P01189 ) gene transcription was conducted . Administration of the P23219 / P35354 inhibitor led to a complete blockage of DB01285 and corticosterone secretion and P01189 gene transcription . The P35354 inhibitor led to a complete blockade of DB01285 secretion and P01189 gene transcription but had no effect on corticosterone secretion . The 5- P28300 inhibitor had no significant effect on any parameter . These results demonstrate the crucial role of eicosanoid pathways in mediating the stimulation of the Q9Y251 axis induced by IL-1beta . Moreover , we found a clear dissociation of the effect of the blockage of COXs upon DB01285 and corticosterone secretion , suggesting that IL-1beta may act at the brain as well as at the adrenal cortex to stimulate the secretion of corticosterone .
