Pulmonary arterial dysfunction in insulin resistant obese Zucker rats . BACKGROUND : P01308 resistance and obesity are strongly associated with systemic cardiovascular diseases . Recent reports have also suggested a link between insulin resistance with pulmonary arterial hypertension . The aim of this study was to analyze pulmonary vascular function in the insulin resistant obese Zucker rat . METHODS : Large and small pulmonary arteries from obese Zucker rat and their lean counterparts were mounted for isometric tension recording . mRNA and protein expression was measured by RT-PCR or Western blot , respectively . KV currents were recorded in isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells using the patch clamp technique . RESULTS : Right ventricular wall thickness was similar in obese and lean Zucker rats . Lung Q13873 , KV1.5 and 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA and protein expression and KV current density were also similar in the two rat strains . In conductance and resistance pulmonary arteries , the similar relaxant responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside and unchanged lung P29474 expression revealed a preserved endothelial function . However , in resistance ( but not in conductance ) pulmonary arteries from obese rats a reduced response to several vasoconstrictor agents ( hypoxia , phenylephrine and 5-HT ) was observed . The hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors was reversed by L-NAME and prevented by the P35228 inhibitor 1400W . CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to rat models of type 1 diabetes or other mice models of insulin resistance , the obese Zucker rats did not show any of the characteristic features of pulmonary hypertension but rather a reduced vasoconstrictor response which could be prevented by inhibition of P35228 .
