Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor cross-reactivity in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease . DB00945 -induced asthma ( AIA ) is a severe and difficult-to-treat allergic disease in which acute asthma attacks are induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Patients with AIA rarely experience asthma attacks when taking celecoxib , a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) 2 . A 33-year-old woman had a severe asthma attack with hypoxia and lost consciousness after oral provocation testing with 15 mg of aspirin and also with 50 mg of celecoxib . After 2 months of treatment with 10 mg/day of oral prednisolone , 1600 Î¼g/day of inhaled fluticasone propionate , montelukast as a leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) , and long-term beta-agonist , we again challenged her with a provocation test with up to 200 mg of celecoxib ; this time there were neither allergic symptoms nor decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second . Patients with severe or poorly controlled asthma may experience asthma attacks even if using selective P35354 inhibitors . However , treatment with steroids and an LTRAs may inhibit asthma attacks induced by celecoxib .
