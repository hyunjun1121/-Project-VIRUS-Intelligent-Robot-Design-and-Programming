Protection of minocycline on early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats . DB01017 has been shown to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia and in other models of brain injury . Our goal is to observe the protection of minocycline on EBI after Q53FZ2 and the mechanism . 48 adult male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups : the sham-operated group , Q53FZ2 group , vehicle group ( Q53FZ2 +normal sodium ) , and minocycline group ( Q53FZ2 +minocycline ) . The Q53FZ2 model was induced by injecting 300 Î¼l of autologous arterial blood into the prechiasmatic cistern . Expressions of P14780 in the hippocampus were examined at 24 h by western blot and zymography . Western blot and zymography showed that the expression of total and active P14780 increased dramatically at 24 h after Q53FZ2 compared with that of the sham group ( P < 0.01 ) . The clinical assessments got a lower score than that of the sham-operated group . After treated with minocycline , the expression of P14780 decreased significantly ( P < 0.01 vs. vehicle group ) , and the clinical assessments improved . We conclude that minocycline can protect EBI after Q53FZ2 , which may be related to the mechanism of inhibiting the expression of P14780 in the hippocampus .
