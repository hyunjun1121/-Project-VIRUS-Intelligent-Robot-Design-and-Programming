TLR and P26718 signaling pathways mediate CS-induced pulmonary pathologies . Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke ( CS ) can have deleterious effects on lung epithelial cells including cell death and the initiation of inflammatory responses . CS-induced cell injury can elaborate cell surface signals and cellular byproducts that stimulate immune system surveillance . Our previous work has shown that the expression of ligands for the cytotoxic lymphocyte activating receptor P26718 is enhanced in patients with P48444 and that the induction of these ligands in a mouse model can replicate P48444 pathologies . Here , we extend these findings to demonstrate a role for the P26718 receptor in CS-induced pathophysiology and provide evidence linking nucleic acid-sensing endosomal toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signaling to P48444 pathology through P26718 activation . Specifically , we show that mice deficient in P26718 exhibit attenuated pulmonary inflammation and airspace enlargement in a model of CS-induced emphysema . Additionally , we show that CS exposure induces the release of free nucleic acids in the bronchoalveolar lavage and that direct exposure of mouse lung epithelial cells to cigarette smoke extract similarly induces functional nucleic acids as assessed by O15455 , 7 , and 9 reporter cell lines . We demonstrate that exposure of mouse lung epithelial cells to TLR ligands stimulates the surface expression of RAET1 , a ligand for P26718 , and that mice deficient in O15455 /7/9 receptor signaling do not exhibit CS-induced NK cell hyperresponsiveness and airspace enlargement . The findings indicate that CS-induced airway injury stimulates TLR signaling by endogenous nucleic acids leading to elevated P26718 ligand expression . Activation of these pathways plays a major role in the altered NK cell function , pulmonary inflammation and remodeling related to long-term CS exposure .
