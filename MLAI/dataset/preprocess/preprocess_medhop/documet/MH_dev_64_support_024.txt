P47712 activation correlates with P04626 overexpression and mediates estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth . Cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha ( cPLA(2)alpha ) catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane glycerol-phospholipids to release arachidonic acid as the first step of the eicosanoid signaling pathway . This pathway contributes to proliferation in breast cancer , and numerous studies have demonstrated a crucial role of cyclooxygenase 2 and prostaglandin E(2) release in breast cancer progression . The role of cPLA(2)alpha activation is less clear , and we recently showed that 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) can rapidly activate cPLA(2)alpha in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . Overexpression or gene amplification of P04626 is found in approximately 30 % of breast cancer patients and correlates with a poor clinical outcome and resistance to endocrine therapy . This study reports the first evidence for a correlation between cPLA(2)alpha enzymatic activity and overexpression of the P04626 receptor . The activation of cPLA(2)alpha in response to E2 treatment was biphasic with the first phase dependent on trans-activation through the matrix metalloproteinase-dependent release of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor . P00533 / P04626 heterodimerization resulted in downstream signaling through the P27361 /2 cascade to promote cPLA(2)alpha phosphorylation at Ser505 . There was a correlation between P04626 and cPLA(2)alpha expression in six breast cancer cell lines examined , and inhibition of P04626 activation or expression in the SKBR3 cell line using herceptin or P04626 -specific small interfering RNA , respectively , resulted in decreased activation and expression of cPLA(2)alpha . Pharmacological blockade of cPLA(2)alpha using a specific antagonist suppressed the growth of both MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells by reducing E2-induced proliferation and by stimulating cellular apoptosis and necrosis . This study highlights cPLAalpha(2) as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in endocrine-dependent and endocrine-independent breast cancer .
