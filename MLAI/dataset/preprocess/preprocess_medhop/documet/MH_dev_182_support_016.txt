Dual ligands targeting dopamine D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors as new antipsychotical or anti-Parkinsonian agents . Psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson 's disease are associated with poly-factorial pathogenic mechanisms , with several neurotransmitter systems closely involved . In addition to the cerebral dopaminergic ( DA ) system , the serotoninergic ( 5-HT ) system also plays a crucial role in regulating psychoemotional , cognitive and motor functions in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Among the large 5-HT receptor family , accumulating data have revealed new insights into the therapeutic benefit of the P08908 receptor in treating various CNS disorders , especially schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease . The present review discusses the advance of dual agents with mixed actions at the dopamine D2 and serotonin P08908 receptors in the treatment of these diseases . Aripiprazole was the only marketed drug with dual D2 and P08908 profile . It is a partial D2 and P08908 receptor agonist and has been prescribed as an atypical antipsychotical drug . Two other drugs DB06016 and Pardoprunox are being investigated in clinic . Most of the other candidate compounds , including DB04888 , Sarizotan , Mazapertine succinate , PF-217830 , and Adoprazine were discontinued due to either non-optimal pharmacokinetic properties or insufficient therapeutical efficacy . Although much effort has been done to highlight the advantages of the P08908 and D2 dual approach , it has to be pointed out that many of these drugs showed poly-pharmacological profile by targeting many other receptors and/or transporters besides the D2 and P08908 receptors . In this regard , ' pure ' compounds exclusively acting on the D2 and P08908 receptors are highly needed to further validate this approach . Meanwhile , safety concerns and in vivo pharmacokinetic alerts should also be implanted to the drug design art early .
