Ellagic acid inhibits P15692 / P35968 , PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling cascades in the hamster cheek pouch carcinogenesis model . BACKGROUND : Blocking vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) mediated tumor angiogenesis by phytochemicals has emerged as an attractive strategy for cancer prevention and therapy . METHODS : We investigated the anti-angiogenic effects of ellagic acid in a hamster model of oral oncogenesis by examining the transcript and protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1α ) , P15692 , P35968 , and the members of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling cascades . Molecular docking studies and cell culture experiments with the endothelial cell line ECV304 were performed to delineate the mechanism by which ellagic acid regulates P15692 signaling . RESULTS : We found that ellagic acid significantly inhibits HIF-1α-induced P15692 / P35968 signalling in the hamster buccal pouch by abrogating PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling via downregulation of PI3K , PDK-1 , p-Akt(ser473) , P42345 , p- P29323 , and p-JNK . Ellagic acid was also found to reduce the expression of histone deacetylases that could inhibit neovascularization . Analysis of the mechanism revealed that ellagic acid inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis via suppression of HDAC-6 in ECV304 cells . Furthermore , knockdown of endogenous Q9UBN7 via small interfering RNA abrogated hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1α and P15692 and blocked Akt activation . Molecular docking studies confirmed interaction of ellagic acid with upstream kinases that regulate angiogenic signaling . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together , these findings demonstrate that the anti-angiogenic activity of ellagic acid may be mediated by abrogation of hypoxia driven PI3K/Akt/ P42345 , MAPK and P15692 / P35968 signaling pathways involving suppression of Q9UBN7 and HIF-1α responses . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE : Ellagic acid offers promise as a lead compound for anticancer therapeutics by virtue of its ability to inhibit key oncogenic signaling cascades and HDACs .
