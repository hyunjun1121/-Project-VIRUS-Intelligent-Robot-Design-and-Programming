The bovine 5' AMPK gene family : mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism detection . The DB00131 -activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) family is an ancient stress response system whose primary function is regulation of cellular DB00171 . Activation of AMPK , which is instigated by environmental and nutritional stresses , initiates energy-conserving measures that protect the cell by inhibition and phosphorylation of key enzymes in energy-consuming biochemical pathways . The seven genes that comprise the bovine AMPK family were mapped in cattle by using a radiation hybrid panel . The seven genes mapped to six different cattle chromosomes , each with a LOD score greater than 10.0 . Q13131 mapped to BTA 20 , P54646 and O43741 to BTA 3 , Q9Y478 to BTA 17 , P54619 to BTA 5 , Q9UGJ0 to BTA 4 , and Q9UGI9 to BTA 2 . Five of the seven genes mapped to regions expected from human/cattle comparative maps . O43741 and Q9UGI9 , however , have not been mapped in humans . We predict these genes to be located on HSA 1 and 2 , respectively . Additionally , one synonymous and one non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) were detected in Q9UGI9 in Bos taurus cattle . In an effort to determine ancestral origins , various herds of mixed breed cattle as well as other ruminant species were characterized for sequence variation in this region of Q9UGI9 . Owing to the physiological importance of this gene family , we believe that its individual genes are candidate genes for conferring resistance to diseases in cattle .
