New insights into clostridial neurotoxin-SNARE interactions . Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A ( DB00083 ) has achieved a dichotomous status in modern medicine ; it is both a versatile treatment for several neurological disorders and a lethal poison responsible for causing the neuroparalytic syndrome botulism . The extent of paralysis largely depends on the dosage of toxin received . The toxins block neurotransmitter release by delivering their DB01593 (2+)-dependent protease components to the presynaptic side of chemical synapses . These highly specialized enzymes exclusively hydrolyze peptide bonds within SNARE ( soluble N-ethylmaleiamide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) proteins . Recently , the structural basis for the highly specific interaction between DB00083 and its target SNARE , P60880 ( synaptosomal-associated protein of 25kDa ) , was elucidated . New details regarding the nature of the toxin-SNARE interactions could be exploited for novel inhibitor design .
