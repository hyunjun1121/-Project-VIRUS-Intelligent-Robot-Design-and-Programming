Tolerance to chronic DB00470 ( Δ⁹-THC ) in rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus . Although Δ⁹-THC has been approved to treat anorexia and weight loss associated with AIDS , it may also reduce well-being by disrupting complex behavioral processes or enhancing HIV replication . To investigate these possibilities , four groups of male rhesus macaques were trained to respond under an operant acquisition and performance procedure , and administered vehicle or Δ⁹-THC before and after inoculation with simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV(mac251) , 100 TCID₅₀/ml , i.v. ) . Prior to chronic Δ⁹-THC and SIV inoculation , 0.032-0.32 mg/kg of Δ⁹-THC produced dose-dependent rate-decreasing effects and small , sporadic error-increasing effects in the acquisition and performance components in each subject . Following 28 days of chronic Δ⁹-THC ( 0.32 mg/kg , i.m. ) or vehicle twice daily , DB00470 -treated subjects developed tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects , and this tolerance was maintained during the initial 7-12 months irrespective of SIV infection ( i.e. , +THC/-SIV , +THC/+SIV ) . Q8N1N2 necropsy was performed on all SIV subjects an average of 329 days post-SIV inoculation , with postmortem histopathology suggestive of a reduced frequency of CNS pathology as well as opportunistic infections in DB00470 -treated subjects . Chronic Δ⁹-THC also significantly reduced CB-1 and P34972 receptor levels in the hippocampus , attenuated the expression of a proinflammatory cytokine ( P13500 ) , and did not increase viral load in plasma , cerebrospinal fluid , or brain tissue compared to vehicle-treated subjects with SIV . Together , these data indicate that chronic Δ⁹-THC produces tolerance to its behaviorally disruptive effects on complex tasks while not adversely affecting viral load or other markers of disease progression during the early stages of infection .
