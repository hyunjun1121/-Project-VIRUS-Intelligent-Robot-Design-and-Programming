Anti-inflammatory effect of transduced PEP-1-cyclophilin A in Raw264.7 cells and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced mice . AIMS : P62937 ( CypA ) is an immunophilin that acts as a receptor for the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) . CypA has emerged as a potential drug target for several inflammatory diseases , although the details of its mechanism are unclear . We examined the protective effects of CypA on inflammation in Raw 264.7 cells and animal models . MAIN METHODS : A human CypA gene was fused with a protein transduction domain , PEP-1 peptide , to construct a cell permeable PEP-1-CypA protein . The protein expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and cytokines was detected by Western blot , ELISA and mRNA level of P35354 and cytokines were measured by RT-PCR . The nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kB ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activation were analyzed by Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Skin inflammation was detected with immunohistochemistry . KEY FINDINGS : Transduced PEP-1-CypA protein markedly inhibited lipopolysaccharide- and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-induced expression levels of P35354 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , transduced PEP-1-CypA protein resulted in a significant reduction in the activation of NF-kB and MAPK . SIGNIFICANCE : The results indicate that PEP-1-CypA inhibits inflammatory response cytokines and enzymes by blocking NF-kB and MAPK activation upon stimulation of inflammation in vitro and in vivo . PEP-1-CypA protein may potentially be used as a therapeutic agent against skin diseases-related inflammation .
