Identification of an acetylation-dependant P12956 /FLIP complex that regulates FLIP expression and HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis . FLIP is a potential anti-cancer therapeutic target that inhibits apoptosis by blocking caspase 8 activation by death receptors . We report a novel interaction between FLIP and the DNA repair protein P12956 that regulates FLIP protein stability by inhibiting its polyubiquitination . Furthermore , we found that the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor DB02546 ( DB02546 ) enhances the acetylation of P12956 , thereby disrupting the FLIP/ P12956 complex and triggering FLIP polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome . Using in vitro and in vivo colorectal cancer models , we further demonstrated that DB02546 -induced apoptosis is dependant on FLIP downregulation and caspase 8 activation . In addition , an Q9UBN7 -specific inhibitor Tubacin recapitulated the effects of DB02546 , suggesting that Q9UBN7 is a key regulator of P12956 acetylation and FLIP protein stability . Thus , HDAC inhibitors with anti- Q9UBN7 activity act as efficient post-transcriptional suppressors of FLIP expression and may , therefore , effectively act as ' FLIP inhibitors ' .
