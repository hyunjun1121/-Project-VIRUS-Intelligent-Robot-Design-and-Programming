Very early-onset lone atrial fibrillation patients have a high prevalence of rare variants in genes previously associated with atrial fibrillation . BACKGROUND : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia . Currently , 14 genes important for ion channel function , intercellular signaling , and homeostatic control have been associated with AF . OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that rare genetic variants in genes previously associated with AF had a higher prevalence in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . METHODS : Sequencing results of P51787 , Q12809 , Q14524 , P22460 , Q9UK17 , P15382 , 2 , 5 , P63252 , P35498 -3B , P01160 , and P36382 from 192 early-onset lone AF patients were compared with data from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server consisting of 6503 persons from 18 different cohort studies . RESULTS : Among the lone AF patients , 29 ( 7.6 % ) alleles harbored a novel or very rare variant ( minor allele frequency < 0.1 in the Exome Variant Server ) , a frequency that was significantly higher than what was found in the reference database ( 4.1 % ; with minor allele frequency < 0.1 ; P = .0012 ) . Previously published electrophysiological data showed that 96 % ( n = 23 ) of the rare variants that has been functionally investigated ( n = 24 ) displayed significant functional changes . CONCLUSIONS : We report a much higher prevalence of rare variants in genes associated with AF in early-onset lone AF patients than in the background population . By presenting these data , we believe that we are the first to provide quantitative evidence for the role of rare variants across AF susceptibility genes as a possible pathophysiological substrate for AF .
