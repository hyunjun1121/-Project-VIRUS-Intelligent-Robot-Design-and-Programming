Neuritogenic actions of botulinum neurotoxin A on cultured motor neurons . Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) are extremely potent neuromuscular poisons that act through soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) protein cleavage to inhibit neurotransmitter release . The ability of BoNT serotype A ( DB00083 ) to eliminate localized transmitter release at extremely low doses is well characterized . In the current study , we investigated the less understood characteristic of DB00083 to induce nerve outgrowth , sometimes referred to as sprouting . This phenomenon is generally considered a secondary response to the paralytic actions of DB00083 , and other potential factors that may initiate this sprouting have not been investigated . Alternatively , we hypothesized that DB00083 induces sprouting through presynaptic receptor activation that is independent of its known intracellular actions on the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa ( P60880 ) . To test this , the effects of DB00083 application on neurite outgrowth were examined using primary cultures enriched with motor neurons isolated from embryonic mouse spinal cord . In this system , DB00083 potently stimulated neuritogenesis at concentrations as low as 0.01 nM . The neuritogenic effects of DB00083 exposure were concentration dependent and antagonized by Triticum vulgaris lectin , a known competitive antagonist of BoNT . Similar results were observed with the isolated DB00083 binding domain , revealing that neuritogenesis could be initiated solely by the binding actions of DB00083 . In addition , the presence or absence of P60880 cleavage by DB00083 was not a determinant factor in DB00083 -induced neuritogenesis . Collectively , these results suggest that binding of DB00083 to the motor neuronal membrane activates neuritogenesis through as yet undetermined intracellular pathway(s) , independent of its known action on vesicular release .
