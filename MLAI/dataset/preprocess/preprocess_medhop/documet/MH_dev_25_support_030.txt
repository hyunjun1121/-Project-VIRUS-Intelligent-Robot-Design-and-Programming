Mesenchymal stem cells control alloreactive CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells . P10747 / P33681 co-stimulation blockade with belatacept prevents alloreactivity in kidney transplant patients . However , cells lacking P10747 are not susceptible to belatacept treatment . As CD8(+) P10747 (-) T-cells have cytotoxic and pathogenic properties , we investigated whether DB05914 ( O60682 ) are effective in controlling these cells . In mixed lymphocyte reactions ( P08235 ) , O60682 and belatacept inhibited peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) proliferation in a dose-dependent manner . O60682 at O60682 /effector cell ratios of 1:160 and 1:2·5 reduced proliferation by 38·8 and 92·2 % , respectively . DB06681 concentrations of 0·1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml suppressed proliferation by 20·7 and 80·6 % , respectively . Both treatments in combination did not inhibit each other 's function . Allostimulated CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells were able to proliferate and expressed the cytolytic and cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B , interferon ( IFN ) -γ and tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α . While belatacept did not affect the proliferation of CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells , O60682 reduced the percentage of P10747 (-) T cells in the proliferating CD8(+) T cell fraction by 45·9 % ( P = 0·009 ) . CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells as effector cells in P08235 in the presence of P01730 (+) T cell help gained P10747 expression , an effect independent of O60682 . In contrast , allostimulated P10747 (+) T cells did not lose P10747 expression in P08235 - O60682 co-culture , suggesting that O60682 control pre-existing P10747 (-) T cells and not newly induced P10747 (-) T cells . In conclusion , alloreactive CD8(+) P10747 (-) T cells that remain unaffected by belatacept treatment are inhibited by O60682 . This study indicates the potential of an O60682 -belatacept combination therapy to control alloreactivity .
