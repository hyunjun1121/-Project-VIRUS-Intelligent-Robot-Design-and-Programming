Anti-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic activities of polyphenols from propolis . Propolis is a polyphenol-rich resinous substance extensively used to improve health and prevent diseases . The effects of polyphenols from different sources of propolis on atherosclerotic lesions and inflammatory and angiogenic factors were investigated in P01130 gene ( LDLr-/- ) knockout mice . The animals received a cholesterol-enriched diet to induce the initial atherosclerotic lesions ( IALs ) or advanced atherosclerotic lesions ( AALs ) . The IAL or AAL animals were divided into three groups , each receiving polyphenols from either the green , red or brown propolis ( 250 mg/kg per day ) by gavage . After 4 weeks of polyphenol treatment , the animals were sacrificed and their blood was collected for lipid profile analysis . The atheromatous lesions at the aortic root were also analyzed for gene expression of inflammatory and angiogenic factors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry . All three polyphenol extracts improved the lipid profile and decreased the atherosclerotic lesion area in IAL animals . However , only polyphenols from the red propolis induced favorable changes in the lipid profiles and reduced the lesion areas in AAL mice . In IAL groups , VCAM , P13500 , FGF , PDGF , P15692 , PECAM and P14780 gene expression was down-regulated , while the metalloproteinase inhibitor P01033 gene was up-regulated by all polyphenol extracts . In contrast , for advanced lesions , only the polyphenols from red propolis induced the down-regulation of P16671 and the up-regulation of P09601 and P01033 when compared to polyphenols from the other two types of propolis . In conclusion , polyphenols from propolis , particularly red propolis , are able to reduce atherosclerotic lesions through mechanisms including the modulation of inflammatory and angiogenic factors .
