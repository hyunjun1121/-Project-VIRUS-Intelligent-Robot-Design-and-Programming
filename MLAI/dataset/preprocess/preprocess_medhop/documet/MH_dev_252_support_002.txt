Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition increases the efficacy of MEK inhibition alone and in combination with P19957 kinase inhibition in lung and pancreatic tumor models . Although mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) kinase ( MEK ) inhibition is predicted to cause cell death by stabilization of the proapoptotic Q7L3V2 O43521 , the induction of apoptosis is often modest . To determine if addition of a Bcl-2 family inhibitor could increase the efficacy of a MEK inhibitor , we evaluated a panel of 53 non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines with the combination of navitoclax ( DB05764 ) , a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL ( P10415 / Q07817 ) antagonist , and a novel Q96HU1 kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , G-963 . The combination is synergistic in the majority of lines , with an enrichment of cell lines harboring P01116 mutations in the high synergy group . Cells exposed to G-963 arrest in P55008 and a small fraction undergo apoptosis . The addition of navitoclax to G-963 does not alter the kinetics of cell-cycle arrest , but greatly increases the percentage of cells that undergo apoptosis . The G-963/navitoclax combination was more effective than either single agent in the P01116 mutant H2122 xenograft model ; O43521 stabilization and PARP cleavage were observed in tumors , consistent with the mechanism of action observed in cell culture . Addition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K , P42336 ) inhibitor P16260 -0941 to this treatment combination increases cell killing compared with double- or single-agent treatment . Taken together , these data suggest the efficacy of agents that target the MAPK and PI3K pathways can be improved by combination with a Bcl-2 family inhibitor .
