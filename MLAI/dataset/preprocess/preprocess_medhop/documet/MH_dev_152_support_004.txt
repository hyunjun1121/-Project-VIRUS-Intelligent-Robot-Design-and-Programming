DB00644 induction of extracellular-signal regulated kinase is blocked by inhibition of calmodulin . Our previous studies demonstrate that DB00644 -induced P29323 activation required influx of extracellular Ca2+ in alphaT3-1 and rat pituitary cells . In the present studies , we examined the hypothesis that calmodulin ( Cam ) plays a fundamental role in mediating the effects of Ca2+ on P29323 activation . Cam inhibition using W7 was sufficient to block DB00644 -induced reporter gene activity for the c-Fos , murine glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit , and MAPK phosphatase ( MKP ) -2 promoters , all shown to require P29323 activation . Inhibition of Cam ( using a dominant negative ) was sufficient to block DB00644 -induced P29323 but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity activation . The Cam-dependent protein kinase ( CamK ) II inhibitor KN62 did not recapitulate these findings . DB00644 -induced phosphorylation of Q02750 and c-Raf kinase was blocked by Cam inhibition , whereas activity of phospholipase C was unaffected , suggesting that Ca2+/Cam modulation of the P29323 cascade potentially at the level of c-Raf kinase . Enrichment of Cam-interacting proteins using a Cam agarose column revealed that c-Raf kinase forms a complex with Cam . Reconstitution studies reveal that recombinant c-Raf kinase can associate directly with Cam in a Ca2+-dependent manner and this interaction is reduced in vitro by addition of W7 . Cam was localized in lipid rafts consistent with the formation of a Ca2+-sensitive signaling platform including the P30968 and c-Raf kinase . These data support the conclusion that Cam may have a critical role as a Ca2+ sensor in specifically linking Ca2+ flux with P29323 activation within the DB00644 signaling pathway .
