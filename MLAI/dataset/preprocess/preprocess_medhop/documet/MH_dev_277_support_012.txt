DB00952 . The new P28222 /1D agonist naratriptan , introduced in many countries in 1997 and 1998 for the acute treatment of migraine , was designed to complement the sumatriptan portfolio of offerings ( including the injection , the tablets , the nasal spray , and in some countries , the suppository ) by offering patients excellent tolerability and a sustained duration of action . Clinical studies on naratriptan , including more than 4000 patients treating more than 15,000 migraine attacks , show that naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg are distinguished from other P28222 /1D agonists for migraine on the basis of their excellent tolerability profile , which does not differ from that of placebo . In addition to its tolerability , naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg possess a long duration of action with a low incidence of headache recurrence ( 17-28 % in phase II and III clinical trials ) . With its tolerability profile and long duration of action , naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg may be particularly appropriate as a single-dose alternative to NSAIDs and analgesics , which often are not effective in migraine but are used because of tolerability considerations .
