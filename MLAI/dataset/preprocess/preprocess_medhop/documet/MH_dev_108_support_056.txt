DB00184 consumption is regulated by a human polymorphism in dopamine neurons . Smoking is the most important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . Recent genome-wide association studies highlighted a human haplotype on chromosome 15 underlying the risk for tobacco dependence and lung cancer . Several polymorphisms in the P32297 - P30532 - P30926 cluster coding for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) α3 , α5 and β4 subunits were implicated . In mouse models , we define a key role in the control of sensitivity to nicotine for the α5 subunit in dopaminergic ( DAergic ) neurons of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) . We first investigated the reinforcing effects of nicotine in drug-naive α5(-/-) mice using an acute intravenous nicotine self-administration task and ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of nicotine-elicited DA cell activation . We designed lentiviral re-expression vectors to achieve targeted re-expression of wild-type or mutant α5 in the VTA , in general , or in DA neurons exclusively . Our results establish a crucial role for α5*-nAChRs in DAergic neurons . These receptors are key regulators that determine the minimum nicotine dose necessary for DA cell activation and thus nicotine reinforcement . Finally , we demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism , the non-synonymous α5 variant rs16969968 , frequent in many human populations , exhibits a partial loss of function of the protein in vivo . This leads to increased nicotine consumption in the self-administration paradigm . We thus define a critical link between a human predisposition marker , its expression in DA neurons and nicotine intake .
