Using ImageJ for the quantitative analysis of flow-based adhesion assays in real-time under physiologic flow conditions . This article intends to close the gap between the abundance of regular articles focusing on adhesive mechanisms of cells in a flow field and purely technical reports confined to the description of newly developed algorithms , not yet ready to be used by users without programming skills . A simple and robust method is presented for analysing raw videomicroscopic data of flow-based adhesion assays using the freely available public domain software ImageJ . We describe in detail the image processing routines used to rapidly and reliably evaluate the number of adherent and translocating platelets in videomicroscopic recordings . The depicted procedures were exemplified by analysing platelet interaction with immobilized P04275 and fibrinogen in flowing blood under physiological wall shear rates . Neutralizing GPIbalpha function reduced shear-dependent platelet translocation on P04275 and abolished firm platelet adhesion . DB00054 , Tirofiban and DB00063 completely inhibited P08514 /IIIa-dependent stable platelet deposition on fibrinogen . The presented method to analyse videomicroscopic recordings from flow-based adhesion assays offers the advantage of providing a simple and reliable way to quantify flow-based adhesion assays , which is completely based on ImageJ and can easily be applied to study adhesion mechanisms of cells in non-fluorescent modes without the need to deviate from the presented protocol .
