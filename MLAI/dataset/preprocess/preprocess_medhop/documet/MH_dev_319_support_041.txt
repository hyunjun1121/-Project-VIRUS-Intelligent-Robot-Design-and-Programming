O75469 induces Q02318 and regulates cholesterol metabolism in the intestine . Mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase ( Q02318 ) catalyzes oxidative cleavage of the sterol side chain in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver and 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol in most tissues . Recent studies suggest that 27-hydroxycholesterol ( 27-HOC ) activates liver orphan receptor alpha ( LXRalpha ) and induces the cholesterol efflux transporters O95477 and P45844 in macrophages . The steroid- and bile acid-activated pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) plays critical roles in the detoxification of bile acids , cholesterol metabolites , and xenobiotics . The role of Q02318 in the intestine is not known . This study investigated O75469 and Q02318 regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the human intestinal cell lines Caco2 and Ls174T . A human O75469 ligand , rifampicin , induced Q02318 mRNA expression in intestine cells but not in liver cells . DB01045 induced Q02318 gene transcription , increased intracellular 27-HOC levels , and induced O95477 and P45844 mRNA expression only in intestine cells . A functional O75469 binding site was identified in the human Q02318 gene . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that rifampicin induced the O75469 recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator 1 to Q02318 chromatin . DB04540 loading markedly increased intracellular 27-HOC levels in intestine cells . DB01045 , 27-HOC , and a potent LXRalpha agonist , T0901317 , induced O95477 and P45844 protein expression and stimulated cholesterol efflux from intestine cells to apolipoprotein A-I and HDL . This study suggests an intestine-specific O75469 / Q02318 /LXRalpha pathway that regulates intestine cholesterol efflux and HDL assembly .
