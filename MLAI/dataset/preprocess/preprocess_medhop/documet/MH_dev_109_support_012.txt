Conjugation and evaluation of 7E3 x P4B6 , a chemically cross-linked bispecific F(ab')2 antibody which inhibits platelet aggregation and localizes tissue plasminogen activator to the platelet surface . A bispecific F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody which recognizes both the platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor and human tissue plasminogen activator was produced to target tPA to platelets for enhancement of thrombolysis . A stable , thioether-cross-linked bispecific F(ab')2 ( 7E3 X P4B6 ) combining the P08514 /IIIa-specific monoclonal antibody DB00054 , which inhibits platelet aggregation , and a nonneutralizing anti-tPA monoclonal antibody ( P4B6 ) was produced . This was performed by coupling each of the parental Fab ' moieties with the homobifunctional cross-linker bis ( maleimido methyl ) ether ( BMME ) . 7E3 X P4B6 was sequentially purified using gel-filtration chromatography and hydrophobic interaction ( HIC ) HPLC . HIC was shown to completely resolve each of the parental F(ab')2 species from the bispecific one . 7E3 X P4B6 was shown to retain completely each of the parental immunoreactivities in P08514 /IIIa and tPA binding EIA 's . The bispecific antibody inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro at levels comparable to those for 7E3 Fab . Recruitment of tPA activity to washed human platelets was demonstrated using the S-2251 chromogenic substrate assay . 7E3 X P4B6 recruited 12-fold more tPA to the washed platelets than a mixture of the parental F(ab')2 molecules used as controls .
