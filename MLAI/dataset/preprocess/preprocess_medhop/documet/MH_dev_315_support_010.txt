Transcriptional profiles during the differentiation and maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells , analyzed using focused microarrays . Dendritic cells ( DC ) are professional antigen-presenting cells capable of initiating primary immune responses . They have been intensively studied and are used in both basic immunology research and clinical immunotherapy . However , the genetic pathways leading to DC differentiation and maturation remain poorly understood . Using focused microarrays with oligonucletotide probes for 120 genes encoding co-stimulatory molecules , chemokines , chemokine receptors , cytokines , cytokine receptors , TLRs , and several other related molecules , we analyzed the kinetics of gene expression for the overall differentiation process of monocytes into mature DC . In parallel , we compared the transcriptional profiles in DC maturation in the presence of LPS , P01375 or trimeric P29965 . We found similar transcriptional profiles for early immature DC and immature DC , respectively generated by culturing monocytes with GM- P04141 and P05112 for three or six days . We identified sets of common and stimuli-specific genes , the expression of which changed following stimulation with LPS , P01375 or P29965 . A dynamic analysis of the entire DC differentiation and maturation process showed that some important inflammatory and constitutive chemokines are transcribed in both immature and mature DC . The correlative expression kinetics of the gene pairs P14778 / P27930 , P40933 / Q13261 , Q9NNX6 / P13598 and Q9NNX6 / P32942 imply that they all play crucial roles in mediating DC functions . Thus , our analysis with focused microarrays shed light on the transcriptional kinetics of DC differentiation and maturation , and this method may also prove useful for identifying novel marker genes involved in DC functions .
