Tumor-derived P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell suppression of dendritic cell function involves TGF-beta and P22301 . P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells have been characterized as a critical population of immunosuppressive cells . They play a crucial role in cancer progression by inhibiting the effector function of P01730 (+) or CD8(+) T lymphocytes . However , whether regulatory T lymphocytes that expand during tumor progression can modulate dendritic cell function is unclear . To address this issue , we have evaluated the inhibitory potential of P01730 (+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells from mice bearing a P11274 - P00519 (+) leukemia on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells . We present data demonstrating that P01730 (+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells from tumor-bearing animals impede dendritic cell function by down-regulating the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB . The expression of the co-stimulatory molecules P33681 , P42081 and P25942 , the production of P01375 , IL-12 , and P13501 /RANTES by the suppressed DC is strongly down-regulated . The suppression mechanism requires TGF-beta and P22301 and is associated with induction of the Smad signaling pathway and activation of the P40763 transcription factor .
