Thiazolidinediones : a comparative review of approved uses . Thiazolidinediones are a powerful and clinically important new class of oral antidiabetic agents that act by improving insulin sensitivity . DB00197 is the prototype drug in this class but was withdrawn from the market in March 2000 due to its association with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity . Currently two thiazolidinediones , rosiglitazone and pioglitazone , are U.S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes . These agents bind to and activate peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma ( P37231 ) and work by altering the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake , glucose disposal , and lipid metabolism . The drugs differ in receptor binding and potency due to differences in their side chain moieties . These agents are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized mainly in the liver . Rosiglitazone is FDA approved for monotherapy and for use in combination therapy with metformin or sulfonylureas . Pioglitazone is FDA approved for monotherapy as well as for use in combination therapy with metformin , insulin , or sulfonylureas . These drugs may also cause significant changes in plasma lipid concentrations , and improved insulin sensitivity may improve ovulatory function and fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . The most serious side effect of the thiazolidinediones is hepatotoxicity . Although rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were not associated with hepatotoxicity in premarketing clinical trials , there were two recent case reports of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in patients treated with rosiglitazone . In addition , these agents may be associated with edema and some hematological changes . The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the two currently approved thiazolidinediones and to suggest an approach for their safe and rational use .
