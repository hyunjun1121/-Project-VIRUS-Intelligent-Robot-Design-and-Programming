Zinc-fingers and homeoboxes ( ZHX ) 2 , a novel member of the ZHX family , functions as a transcriptional repressor . Zinc-fingers and homeoboxes ( ZHX ) 1 is a transcription factor that interacts with the activation domain of the A subunit of nuclear factor-Y ( P23511 ) . Using a yeast two-hybrid system , a novel ubiquitous transcription factor Q9Y6X8 as a Q9UKY1 -interacting protein was cloned . Q9Y6X8 consists of 837 amino acid residues and contains two zinc-finger motifs and five homeodomains ( HDs ) as well as Q9UKY1 . The mRNA is expressed among various tissues . Q9Y6X8 not only forms a heterodimer with Q9UKY1 , but also forms a homodimer . Moreover , Q9Y6X8 interacts with the activation domain of P23511 . Further analysis revealed that Q9Y6X8 is a transcriptional repressor that is localized in the nuclei . Since Q9Y6X8 shares a number of properties in common with Q9UKY1 , we conclude that all these come under the ZHX family . The minimal functional domains of Q9Y6X8 were then characterized . The dimerization domain with both Q9UKY1 and Q9Y6X8 is the region containing HD1 , the domain that interacts with P23511 is the HD1 to Q92769 region , the repressor domain is the HD1 to a proline-rich region . Lastly , using an immunoprecipitation assay , we showed that Q9Y6X8 intrinsically interacts with P23511 in P29320 -293 cells and that Q9Y6X8 represses the promoter activity of the cdc25C gene stimulated by NF-Y in Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells . Thus the ZHX family of proteins may participate in the expression of a number of NF-Y-regulated genes via a more organized transcription network .
