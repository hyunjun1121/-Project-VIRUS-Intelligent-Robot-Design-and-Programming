Microphotometric analysis of DB00157 -tetrazolium reductase deficiency in fibroblasts of patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy . We employed a microphotometric approach to examine whether a defect in the mitochondrial respiratory complex I expected in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy ( LHON ) as the consequence of a mtDNA ( 11778G > A ) mutation in the P03905 gene coding for a subunit of the respiratory complex I can be detected at the single-cell level . Genetically stable fibroblast cell lines were established from skin biopsies of two members of a Chinese Indonesian family with LHON . The fibroblasts were homoplasmic for the 11778G > A mutation . The activity of the respiratory complex I was examined histochemically by staining for DB00157 -tetrazolium reductase . The histochemical staining showed a typical pattern with an apparent concentration of the activity around the nucleus , suggested as the reflection of the gradient in the thickness of the unsectioned fibroblast cells . Microphotometric quantification of the staining intensity showed that the activity is linear for at least 60 min . The activity shows a discontinuity in its Arrhenius kinetics with a break point at 13.0-13.5 degrees C ( activation energy at 50-58 J/mol and 209-238 J/mol above and below the break temperature , respectively ) , indicating the membrane association of the DB00157 -tetrazolium reductase activity . Both patients showed lower fibroblast DB00157 -tetrazolium reductase activity , with a reduction of degrees 30 % . Our results demonstrate the utility of microphotometric analysis in the study of biochemical defects associated with mutations in the mtDNA .
