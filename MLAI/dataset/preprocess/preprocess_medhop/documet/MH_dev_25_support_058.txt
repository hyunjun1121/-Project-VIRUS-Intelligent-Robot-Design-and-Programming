Prolonged , low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin , combined with P16410 -Ig , promotes engraftment in a stringent transplant model . BACKGROUND : Despite significant nephrotoxicity , calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) remain the cornerstone of immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation . We , along with others , have reported tolerogenic properties of anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG , ThymoglobulinÂ® ) , evinced by its ability both to spare Tregs from depletion in vivo and , when administered at low , non-depleting doses , to expand Tregs ex vivo . Clinical trials investigating P33681 / P10747 blockade ( DB06681 , DB06681 ) in kidney transplant recipients have proven that the replacement of toxic CNI use is feasible in selected populations . METHODS : Rabbit polyclonal anti-murine thymocyte globulin ( mATG ) was administered as induction and/or prolonged , low-dose therapy , in combination with P16410 -Ig , in a stringent , fully MHC-mismatched murine skin transplant model to assess graft survival and mechanisms of action . RESULTS : Prolonged , low-dose mATG , combined with P16410 -Ig , effectively promotes engraftment in a stringent transplant model . Our data demonstrate that mATG achieves graft acceptance primarily by promoting Tregs , while P16410 -Ig enhances mATG function by limiting activation of the effector T cell pool in the early stages of treatment , and by inhibiting production of anti-rabbit antibodies in the maintenance phase , thereby promoting regulation of alloreactivity . CONCLUSION : These data provide the rationale for development of novel , CNI-free clinical protocols in human transplant recipients .
