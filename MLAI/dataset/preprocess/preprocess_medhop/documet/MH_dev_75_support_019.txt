[ Detection of a high-affinity prostaglandin I2 binding site in the human thyroid ] . This study is concerned with the identification and the pharmacological properties of P43119 binding sites on human thyroid membrane fractions . Scatchard analysis is not linear , revealing a high- and a low-affinity receptor binding site . ( 3 H ) DB01088 binding experiments were performed under various clinical conditions : in thyroid cancer the low-affinity binding sites disappear totally and the specific high-affinity binding sites are diminished according to the grade of differentiation of the cancer . An alteration in Bmax and Kd is also observed in cold nodules , in Hashimoto 's and Riedl 's thyroiditis and in hyperthyroidism , whereas hot nodules exhibit an increase in both the receptor subpopulations . The data provide evidence for specific DB01240 binding sites and support the suggestion of a direct regulatory key-role of DB01240 in thyroid intermediary metabolism .
