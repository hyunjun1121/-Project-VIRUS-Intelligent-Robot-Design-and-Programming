DB08860 , a potent hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitor , increases cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene expression in HepG2 cells . BACKGROUND : The effect of pitavastatin on the mRNA levels of apolipoprotein ( apo ) A-I , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( PPARalpha ) , cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase ( P22680 ) , and farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) in HepG2 cells was examined to establish whether pitavastatin affects bile acid synthesis and if so , to determine a possible molecular mechanism . METHODS AND RESULTS : HepG2 cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium for 18 h before drug treatment . Total RNA was extracted at set times and mRNA levels were quantified by reverse transcription-real time polymerase chain reaction . DB08860 at 0.1 , 1 , 5 , and 10 micromol/L increased the mRNA levels of apo A-I , PPARalpha , P22680 , and Q96RI1 in a dose-dependent manner . The mRNA levels of apo A-I , Q07869 alpha , P22680 , and Q96RI1 similarly increased with increasing doses of pitavastatin . Coincubation of mevalonate ( 4 mmol/L ) with pitavastatin ( 5 micromol/L ) reversed the inductive effects of pitavastatin on the mRNA levels of these genes , indicating that the inductive effects of pitavastatin were related to its inhibition of P04035 . CONCLUSIONS : DB08860 increased the mRNA levels of P22680 in HepG2 cells , suggesting that increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids may be the mechanism for its potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects .
