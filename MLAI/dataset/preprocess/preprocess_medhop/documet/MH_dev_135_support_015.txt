A brief cognitive-behavioural social skills training for stabilised outpatients with schizophrenia : a preliminary study . Achieving social functioning and achieving social competence are two main objectives of psychosocial interventions for people suffering from schizophrenia . The present preliminary study presents a novel approach of social skills training ( P61278 ) based on the proposals of Kopelowicz et al . ( Kopelowicz , A. , Liberman , R. P. , and Zarate , R. , 2006. Schizophr. Bull. 32 ( 1 ) : P28222 -23 ) that link the treatment to seven specific target behaviours : social perception , social information processing , responding and sending skills , affiliative skills , interactional skills , and behaviour governed by social norms . Thirty-one stabilised outpatients were randomly assigned to one of two groups , P61278 ( n=13 ) or treatment-as-usual ( n=18 ) ( P10636 ; case management , medication adherence , psychotherapy , leisure engagement , and family support ) and were assessed at baseline in cognitive performance , clinical symptomatology , social cognition , and psychosocial functioning . These outcomes were evaluated across post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up appointment . P61278 subjects showed improvements in psychopathology , social discomfort , social cognition ( self-regulation statements during interactions ) , social withdrawal , interpersonal communication , and quality of life compared with the P10636 group . At the 6-month follow-up , results were maintained for negative symptoms , social discomfort , and some functioning outcomes . Neuropsychological variables were also examined , as mediators of benefit from skills training . Results support the efficacy of the brief P61278 for outpatients with schizophrenia and show the need to implement empirically supported interventions in mental health services to enhance patients ' social functioning and quality of life .
