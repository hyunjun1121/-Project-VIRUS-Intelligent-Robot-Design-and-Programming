Smoke exposure of human macrophages reduces O15379 activity , resulting in enhanced inflammatory cytokine production . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) is a debilitating condition resulting from exposure to pollutants such as cigarette smoke . Pulmonary macrophages secrete a plethora of inflammatory mediators that are increased in the lungs of P48444 patients , but whether this phenotype results directly from smoke exposure remains unknown . Using an in vitro model for alveolar macrophages ( AM ) derived from human peripheral blood monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor ( GM-MØ ) , we analyzed the mechanistic connection between cigarette smoke exposure and histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) regulation , hypothesized to be a contributing factor in P48444 pathophysiology . Here we show that acute smoke exposure inhibits HDAC enzymatic activity in GM-MØ . Analysis of mRNA and total cellular proteins for expression of class I ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 8 ) , class II ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ) , and class IV ( 11 ) HDAC revealed no effect of smoke exposure , whereas nuclear O15379 protein content was reduced . To better understand the physiological significance of reduced O15379 activity , we utilized siRNA to knockdown Q13547 , 2 and 3 individually . Interestingly , siRNA-mediated reduction of O15379 resulted in increased production of P10145 and IL1β in response to LPS stimulation , while Q92769 knockdown had no effect on either cytokine . Lower nuclear content of O15379 in the context of equivalent total HDAC protein levels following smoke exposure may reflect increased nuclear export of O15379 , allowing increased nuclear factor kappa b ( NF-κB ) driven cytokine expression that can contribute to inflammation .
