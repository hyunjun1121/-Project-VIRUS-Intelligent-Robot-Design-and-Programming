P00374 hysteresis and its effect of inhibitor binding analyses . Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase was shown to follow slow transient kinetics ( hysteresis ) . Nonlinear reaction velocities were detected during the enzyme assay and required 10-15 min to reach a steady-state rate . The degree of hysteresis was influenced by the enzyme concentration and the order of substrate addition . Incubation of the enzyme with NADPH before addition of dihydrofolate resulted in slow initial velocities that increased up to 2-fold during the course of the assay . Increasing the enzyme concentration from 0.2 to 1 nM resulted in diminished hysteresis . NADPH-initiated reactions were linear at all enzyme concentrations tested . Certain drugs had profound effects on hysteresis . DB00205 practically eliminated the hysteresis of dihydrofolate-started reactions , whereas trimethoprime augmented the non-linearities in the sense that hysteresis was detected in both enzyme- and NADPH-started reactions . The shape of these reaction tracings makes trimethoprim is not a slow-binding inhibitor when assayed under conditions that eliminate hysteresis . Contrary to this , sulfamethoxazole did not affect hysteresis or augment inhibition of the enzyme by trimethoprim . Sulfamethoxazole alone ( at 6 mM ) did not inhibit the hysteresis and allow reliable determinations of Ki values of both weak and tight binding inhibitors . For example , Ki values for pyrimethamine , trimethoprim , and methotrexate were found to be 214 nM , 1.3 nM , and 0.021 nM , respectively .
