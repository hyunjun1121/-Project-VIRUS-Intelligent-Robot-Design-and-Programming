Impairment of nitrergic system and delayed gastric emptying in low density lipoprotein receptor deficient female mice . BACKGROUND : In the current study , we have investigated whether low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice ( P01130 -KO ) , moderate oxidative stress model and cholesteremia burden display gastroparesis and if so whether nitrergic system is involved in this setting . In addition , we have investigated if sepiapterin ( O43157 ) supplementation attenuated impaired nitrergic system and delayed gastric emptying . METHODS : Gastric emptying and nitrergic relaxation were measured in overnight fasting mice . nNOSα dimerization , anti-oxidant markers such as Nrf2 , P48507 , P48506 , P09601 , catalase ( CAT ) , and superoxide dismutase ( P00441 ) were measured using standard methods . DB03886 levels and intestinal transit time were measured using HPLC and dye migration assay , respectively . Wild type ( WT ) and P01130 -KO were supplemented with O43157 . KEY RESULTS : In P01130 null stomachs : ( i ) significant reduction in rate of gastric emptying , gastric pyloric and fundus nitrergic relaxation and nNOSα dimerization , ( ii ) elevated oxidized biopterins and reduced ratio of BH(4) /BH(2) + B , ( iii ) reduced Nrf2 and P48506 protein expression and no change in P48507 , P09601 , CAT , P00441 , and ( iv ) accelerated small intestinal motility were noticed . Supplementation of O43157 restored delayed gastric emptying , impaired pyloric and fundus nitrergic relaxation with restoration of P29475 dimerization and P29475 expression . CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES : This novel data suggests that hyperlipidemia and/or suppression of selective antioxidants may be a potential cause of developing gastroparesis in diabetic patients .
