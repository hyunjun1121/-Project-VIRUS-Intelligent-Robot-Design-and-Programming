Amelioration of nephropathy with apoA-1 mimetic peptide in apoE-deficient mice . BACKGROUND : There is mounting evidence that dyslipidaemia may contribute to development and progression of renal disease . For instance , hyperlipidaemia in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( apoE(-/-) ) mice is associated with glomerular inflammation , mesangial expansion and foam cell formation . ApoA-1 mimetic peptides are potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds which are highly effective in ameliorating atherosclerosis and inflammation in experimental animals . Given the central role of oxidative stress and inflammation in progression of renal disease , we hypothesized that apoA-1 mimetic peptide , D-4F , may attenuate renal lesions in apoE(-/-) mice . METHODS : Twenty-five-month-old female apoE(-/-) mice were treated with D-4F ( 300 µg/mL in drinking water ) or placebo for 6 weeks . Kidneys were harvested and examined for histological and biochemical characteristics . RESULTS : Compared with the control mice , apoE(-/-) mice showed significant proteinuria , tubulo-interstitial inflammation , mesangial expansion , foam cell formation and up-regulation of oxidative [ NAD(P)H oxidase subunits ] and inflammatory [ NF-κB , P13500 , P05121 and P35354 ] pathways . D-4F administration lowered proteinuria , improved renal histology and reversed up-regulation of inflammatory and oxidative pathways with only minimal changes in plasma lipid levels . CONCLUSIONS : The apoE(-/-) mice develop proteinuria and glomerular and tubulo-interstitial injury which are associated with up-regulation of oxidative and inflammatory mediators in the kidney and are ameliorated by the administration of apoA-1 mimetic peptide . These observations point to the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of renal disease in hyperlipidaemic animals and perhaps humans .
