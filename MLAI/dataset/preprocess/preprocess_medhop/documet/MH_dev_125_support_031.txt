The effects of minocycline and tetracycline on the mitotic response of human peripheral blood-lymphocytes . The effects of minocycline and tetracycline on the mitotic response of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was investigated in vitro . The effects of the antibiotics on the mitotic response of purified lymphocytes stimulated with P01584 varied according to the individual from whom the lymphocytes were obtained . At concentrations above those reported to be present in serum during conventional therapy ( 2-8 mg/l ) , there was a tendency for both minocycline and tetracycline to suppress the mitotic response . DB01017 was superior to tetracycline in this respect . However , at physiological concentrations the antibiotics either had no significant effect , suppressed the mitotic response ( minocycline at 2 mg/l with one of six donors ) , or enhanced the mitotic response ( tetracycline at 2 and 8 mg/l with four of six donors ) . The stimulatory effect of tetracycline was not demonstrated when lymphocytes were cultured in whole blood for up to seven days with the antibiotic alone . Similar effects of the antibiotics were observed when mononuclear cell fractions isolated from six donors were stimulated with an optimal concentration of phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) . Stimulation of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures with PHA in the presence of minocycline and tetracycline revealed that , under these culture conditions , the antibiotics could suppress the mitotic response of lymphocytes at physiological doses with cells from a majority of donors .
