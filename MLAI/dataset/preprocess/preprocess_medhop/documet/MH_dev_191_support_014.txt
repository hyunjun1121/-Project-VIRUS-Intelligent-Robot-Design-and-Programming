Pathways targeted by antidiabetes drugs are enriched for multiple genes associated with type 2 diabetes risk . Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have uncovered > 65 common variants associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) ; however , their relevance for drug development is not yet clear . Of note , the first two T2D-associated loci ( P37231 and Q14654 / Q09428 ) encode known targets of antidiabetes medications . We therefore tested whether other genes/pathways targeted by antidiabetes drugs are associated with T2D . We compiled a list of 102 genes in pathways targeted by marketed antidiabetic medications and applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( MAGENTA [ Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations ] ) to this gene set , using available GWAS meta-analyses for T2D and seven quantitative glycemic traits . We detected a strong enrichment of drug target genes associated with T2D ( P = 2 × 10(-5) ; 14 potential new associations ) , primarily driven by insulin and thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) targets , which was replicated in an independent meta-analysis ( Metabochip ) . The glycemic traits yielded no enrichment . The T2D enrichment signal was largely due to multiple genes of modest effects ( P = 4 × 10(-4) , after removing known loci ) , highlighting new associations for follow-up ( P33121 , P19838 , P11168 , incretin targets ) . Furthermore , we found that TZD targets were enriched for LDL cholesterol associations , illustrating the utility of this approach in identifying potential side effects . These results highlight the potential biomedical relevance of genes revealed by GWAS and may provide new avenues for tailored therapy and T2D treatment design .
