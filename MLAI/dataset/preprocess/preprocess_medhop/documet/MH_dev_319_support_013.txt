Acute treatment with cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212.2 improves prepulse inhibition in psychosocially stressed mice . Cannabis , similar to psychosocial stress , is well known to exacerbate psychotic experiences and can precipitate psychotic episodes in vulnerable individuals . Cannabinoid receptors 1 ( P21554 ) are widely expressed in the brain and are particularly important to mediate the effects of cannabis . Chronic cannabis use in patients and chronic cannabinoids treatment in animals is known to cause reduced prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) . Similarly , chronic psychosocial stress in mice impairs PPI . In the present study , we investigated the synergistic effects of substances modulating the P21554 -receptors and chronic psychosocial stress on PPI . For this purpose , adult C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to chronic psychosocial stress using the resident-intruder paradigm . The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212.2 served as a surrogate marker for the effects of cannabis in the brain . After exposure to stress mice were acutely injected with WIN55212.2 ( 3 mg/kg ) with or without pre-treatment with DB06155 ( 3 mg/kg ) , a specific P21554 -receptor antagonist , and subjected to behavioral testing . Stressed mice displayed a higher vulnerability to WIN55212.2 in the PPI test than control animals . The effects of WIN55212.2 on PPI were antagonized by DB06155 suggesting an involvement of P21554 -receptors in sensorimotor gating . Interestingly , WIN55212.2 increased PPI in psychosocially stressed mice although previous studies in rats showed the opposite effects . It may thus be possible , that depending on the doses of cannabinoids/ P21554 -receptor agonists applied and environmental conditions ( psychosocial stress ) , opposite effects can be evoked in different experimental animals . Taken together , our data imply that P21554 -receptors might play a crucial role in the synergistic effects of psychosocial stress and cannabinoids in brain .
