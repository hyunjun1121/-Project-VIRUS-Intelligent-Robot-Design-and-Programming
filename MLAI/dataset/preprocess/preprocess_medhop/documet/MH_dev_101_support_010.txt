Increasing P16070 +/ P25063 (-) tumor stem cells , and upregulation of P35354 and Q9UBN7 , as major functions of P04626 in breast tumorigenesis . BACKGROUND : Cancer cells are believed to arise primarily from stem cells . P16070 +/ P25063 (-) have been identified as markers for human breast cancer stem cells . Although , P04626 is a well known breast cancer oncogene , the mechanisms of action of this gene are not completely understood . Previously , we have derived immortal ( M13SV1 ) , weakly tumorigenic ( M13SV1R2 ) and highly tumorigenic ( M13SV1R2N1 ) cell lines from a breast epithelial cell type with stem cell phenotypes after successive SV40 large T-antigen transfection , X-ray irradiation and ectopic expression of P04626 /C-erbB2/neu . Recently , we found that M13SV1R2 cells became non-tumorigenic after growing in a growth factor/hormone-deprived medium ( R2d cells ) . RESULTS : In this study , we developed M13SV1R2N1 under the same growth factor/hormone-deprived condition ( R2N1d cells ) . This provides an opportunity to analyze P04626 effect on gene expression associated with tumorigenesis by comparative study of R2d and R2N1d cells with homogeneous genetic background except P04626 expression . The results reveal distinct characters of R2N1d cells that can be ascribed to P04626 : 1 ) development of fast-growing tumors ; 2 ) high frequency of P16070 +/ P25063 (-) cells ( ~50 % for R2N1d vs. ~10 % for R2d ) ; 3 ) enhanced expression of P35354 , Q9UBN7 mediated , respectively , by MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways , and many genes associated with inflammation , metastasis , and angiogenesis . Furthermore , P04626 expression can be down regulated in non-adhering R2N1d cells . These cells showed longer latent period and lower rate of tumor development compared with adhering cells . CONCLUSIONS : P04626 may induce breast cancer by increasing the frequency of tumor stem cells and upregulating the expression of P35354 and Q9UBN7 that play pivotal roles in tumor progression .
