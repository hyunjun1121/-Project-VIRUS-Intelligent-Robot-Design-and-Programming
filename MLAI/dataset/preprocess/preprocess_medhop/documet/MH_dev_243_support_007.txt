Induction of cytokine gene expression in human thyroid epithelial cells irradiated with HZE particles ( iron ions ) . Gene expression profiles were examined using cDNA microarray technology in human thyroid epithelial ( Htori-3 ) cells exposed to a low , non-toxic dose ( 10 cGy ) of radiation from HZE particles in the form of iron ions in the absence or presence of selenomethionine ( SeM ) . A total of 215 genes were differentially regulated 2 h after exposure to a 10-cGy dose of iron-ion radiation . In the microarray analysis , SeM had profound effects on the radiation-induced expression of several specific genes , which includes P00749 , P17936 , P15328 , P15291 and P02452 . Of particular interest to us was a gene cluster , " secreted proteins " , that was up-regulated after radiation exposure . Seven up-regulated genes of this gene cluster fall within the chemokine/cytokine gene cluster , namely , P09341 , P19875 , P05231 , P20809 , P10145 , Q13007 and TGFbeta2 . In microarray studies , the radiation-induced up-regulated expression of some these genes encoding cytokine/chemokine proteins was significantly decreased by SeM treatment . For P10145 , TGFbeta2 , P09341 and P19875 , these observations were validated by qPCR techniques . It is concluded that SeM can regulate ionizing radiation-induced gene expression and may serve as an effective countermeasure for some of the acute inflammatory/immune responses induced by low-dose HZE-particle radiation .
