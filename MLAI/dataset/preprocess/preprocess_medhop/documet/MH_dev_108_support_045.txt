Tuberculosis risk in patients treated with non-anti-tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) targeted biologics and recently licensed P01375 -α inhibitors : data from clinical trials and national registries . This review aimed to evaluate the risk of active tuberculosis ( TB ) occurrence in patients with rheumatic disorders receiving non-anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) targeted biologics anakinra ( ANK ) , tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , rituximab ( RTX ) , abatacept ( ABA ) , and recently approved anti- P01375 DB06674 ( GOL ) , and certolizumab pegol ( P53007 ) . In recent findings , no cases of active TB were recorded in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and other rheumatic conditions treated with anti- P11836 + RTX and anti- P10747 ABA . No patient receiving anti-interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) ANK developed active TB , and an increased risk was excluded in a Canadian database . In contrast , 8 active TB cases were observed in 21 trials of patients with RA receiving anti- P05231 TCZ , while no increased TB risk resulted from Japanese postmarketing surveillance . Among GOL-treated and P53007 -treated patients , 8 and 10 active TB cases occurred , respectively , while no data are available from registries . However , all but 1 TB case recorded in patients treated with TCZ , GOL , and P53007 occurred in TB-endemic countries . No TB risk resulted for ANK , RTX , and ABA , suggesting pretreatment screening procedures for latent TB infection detection are unnecessary . Because all TB cases occurred in countries at high risk for TB , where TB exposure could have occurred during treatment , no definitive conclusions can be drawn for TCZ , GOL , and P53007 .
