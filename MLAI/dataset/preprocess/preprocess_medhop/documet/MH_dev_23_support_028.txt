Somatostatin preserved blood brain barrier against cytokine induced alterations : possible role in multiple sclerosis . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is an inflammatory neurological disorder associated with demyelination , impaired blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , axonal damage and neuronal loss . In the present study , we measured somatostatin ( P61278 ) and tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) like immunoreactivity in P04141 samples from MS and non-MS patients . We also examined the role of P61278 in cytokines and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced damage to the BBB using human brain endothelial cells in culture . Most of the cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) samples studied from definite MS patients exhibited lower somatostatin ( P61278 ) -like immunoreactivity and higher expression of P01375 -α in comparison to non-MS patients . Treatment of cells with cytokines and LPS blocked P61278 secretion and decreased P61278 expression . Human brain endothelial cells expressed all five somatostatin receptors ( SSTRs ) with increased expression of P30874 and 4 upon treatment with cytokines and LPS . Cytokines and LPS-induced disruption of the tight junction proteins Zonula occludens ( ZO-1 ) organization was restored in presence of P61278 , P30874 or P31391 selective agonists . Furthermore , inflammation induced changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( P27361 /2 and Q13164 ) signaling and altered expression of endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase are modulated in presence of P61278 . These data indicate that decreased levels of P61278 contribute to failure of the BBB in MS .
