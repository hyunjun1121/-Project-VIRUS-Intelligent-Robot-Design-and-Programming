Ontogeny of gene expression in the gonadotroph of the developing female rat . During the infantile period of the female rat ( 8-21 postnatal days [ P01160 ] of age ) , there is a dramatic increase in plasma DB00094 , which is thought to be important in initiating ovarian activity and , perhaps , the onset of puberty . To begin to understand the regulation of this DB00094 surge , we determined the ontogenetic development of LHbeta , FSHbeta , and P30968 ( P30968 ) mRNA levels in the pituitary gland throughout the infantile period of the female rat . Steady-state mRNA levels were determined by an external standard quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay . FSHbeta and P30968 mRNA levels increased to peak on P01160 12 ( p < 0.03 ) . LHbeta mRNA levels remained relatively constant until rising on P01160 18 . A DB00644 antagonist ( 10-100 microg/animal ) was administered daily from P01160 8-11 or P01160 11-13 , and animals were killed on P01160 12 or P01160 14 , respectively . FSHbeta , LHbeta , and P30968 mRNAs were not affected by DB00644 antagonist treatment . Plasma DB00094 was selectively reduced in the first group , whereas both plasma LH and DB00094 were suppressed in the second group . These data indicate that gene expression of LHbeta , FSHbeta , and P30968 are differentially regulated in the infantile female rat pituitary . DB00644 is involved in regulating the secretion of DB00094 and LH during the infantile period but not in regulating FSHbeta , LHbeta , or P30968 mRNA gene expression .
