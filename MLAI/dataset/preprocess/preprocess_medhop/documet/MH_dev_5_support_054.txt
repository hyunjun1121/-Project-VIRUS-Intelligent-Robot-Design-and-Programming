Differential involvement of Galpha16 in CC chemokine-induced stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta , P29323 , and chemotaxis . Chemokines are known to regulate the chemotaxis of leukocytes and play an important role in immunological processes . Chemokine receptors are widely distributed in hematopoietic cells and are often co-localized with the hematopoietic-specific G(16) and its close relative , G(14) . Yet , many chemokine receptors utilize pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) proteins for signaling . Given that both G(16) and G(14) are capable of linking G(i)-coupled receptors to the stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta , we examined the capacity of six CC chemokine receptors ( P32246 , CCR2a , CCR2b , P51677 , P51681 and P32248 ) to interact with G(14) and G(16) in a heterologous expression system . Among the CC chemokine receptors tested , P32246 , CCR2b , and P51677 were capable of mediating chemokine-induced stimulation of phospholipase Cbeta via either G(14) or G(16) . The G(14)/G(16)-mediated responses exhibited CC chemokine dose-dependency and were resistant to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) treatment . In contrast , CCR2a , P51681 and P32248 were unable to interact with G(14) and G(16) . Under identical experimental conditions , all six CC chemokine receptors were fully capable of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase via G(i) as well as stimulating phospholipase Cbeta via 16z44 , a G(16/z) chimera that possesses increased promiscuity toward G(i)-coupled receptors . Moreover , P32246 -mediated P27361 /2 phosphorylation was largely PTX-insensitive in THP-1 monocytic cells that endogenously express Galpha(16) . In addition , P32246 agonist was less efficacious in mediating chemotaxis of THP-1 cells following the knockdown of Galpha(16) by overexpressing siRNA , indicating the participation of Galpha(16) in P32246 -induced cell migration . These results show that different CC chemokine receptors can discriminate against G(14) and G(16) for signal transduction .
