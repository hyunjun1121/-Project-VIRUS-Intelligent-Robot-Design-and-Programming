Genomic imbalance of O75330 / O75330 regulates the sensitivity and response of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells to aurora kinase inhibition . Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours ( MPNST ) are rare , hereditary cancers associated with neurofibromatosis type I . MPNSTs lack effective treatment options as they often resist chemotherapies and have high rates of disease recurrence . O14965 ( O14965 ) is an emerging target in cancer and an aurora kinase inhibitor ( AKI ) , termed DB05220 , shows promise against MPNST cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Here , we test DB05220 against two primary human MPNST grown in vivo as xenotransplants and find that treatment results in tumour cells exiting the cell cycle and undergoing endoreduplication , which cumulates in stabilized disease . Targeted therapies can often fail in the clinic due to insufficient knowledge about factors that determine tumour susceptibilities , so we turned to three MPNST cell-lines to further study and modulate the cellular responses to AKI . We find that the sensitivity of cell-lines with amplification of O14965 depends upon the activity of the kinase , which correlates with the expression of the regulatory gene products Q9ULW0 and O75330 / O75330 . Silencing of O75330 / O75330 , but not Q9ULW0 , augments O14965 activity and sensitizes MPNST cells to AKI . Furthermore , we find that O14965 activity is critical to the propagation and self-renewal of sphere-enriched MPNST cancer stem-like cells . AKI treatment significantly reduces the formation of spheroids , attenuates the self-renewal of spheroid forming cells , and promotes their differentiation . Moreover , silencing of O75330 / O75330 is sufficient to endow MPNST cells with an ability to form and maintain sphere culture . Collectively , our data indicate that O14965 is a rationale therapeutic target for MPNST and tumour cell responses to AKI , which include differentiation , are modulated by the abundance of O75330 / O75330 .
