Effects of ellagic Acid on angiogenic factors in prostate cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Several natural antioxidants , including ellagic acid ( EA ) , have been reported to have chemotherapeutic activity in vivo and in vitro settings . Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) activity and synthesis of both epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs ) and 20-hydroxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid ( 20-HETE ) , together with vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and heme oxygenase system ( HO ) have emerged as important modulators of tumor growth and metastasis . METHODS : The anti-angiogenic effects of EA were investigated in the human prostatic cancer cell line LnCap . P09601 , P30519 , P51589 and soluble epoxyde hydrolase ( sEH ) expressions were evaluated by western blotting . Levels of P15692 and osteoprotegerin ( O00300 ) were determined in the culture supernatant using an ELISA assay , while CYP mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR . RESULTS : EA treatment induced a significant decrease ( p < 0.05 ) in P09601 , P30519 and P51589 expression , and in P15692 and O00300 levels . Similarly P51589 , P78329 and CYPA22 mRNAs were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) down-regulated by EA treatment . The decrease in P51589 mRNA was associated with an increase in sEH expression . CONCLUSIONS : RESULTS reported in the present study highlighted the ability of EA to modulate a new pathway , in addition to anti-proliferative and pro-differentiation properties , via a mechanism that involves a decrease in eicosanoid synthesis and a down-regulation of the HO system in prostate cancer .
