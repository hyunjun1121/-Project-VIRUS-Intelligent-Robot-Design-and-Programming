[ Effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on catalepsy and immune response in mice genetically predisposed to freezing reaction : the role of P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptors and tph2 and P31645 genes ] . ASC/Icg ( Antidepressant Sensitive Catalepsy ) mouse strain selected for high predisposition to pinch-induced catalepsy is characterized by depressive-like behavior and impaired immune response . Chronic treatment with SSRI fluoxetine attenuated catalepsy manifestation and normalized a decreased number of rosette-forming cells ( P41440 ) in spleen in ASC mice . Chronic fluoxetine administration had no effect on catalepsy and P41440 number in mice of parental cataleptic CBA/Lac strain . DB00472 failed to alter P08908 receptor functional activity in mice of both strains and diminished 5- Q13049 receptor functional activity in CBA but not in ASC mice . No effect on cortical P08908 and 5- Q13049 receptor mRNA levels and on P08908 receptor , tph2 ( tryptophan hydroxylase-2 ) and P31645 ( serotonin transporter ) mesencephalic gene expression was observed in ASC mice . Other possible serotonergic mechanisms of fluoxetine effect on catalepsy and immune response in mice with depressive-like state are discussed .
