O60674 modulates the apolipoprotein interactions with O95477 required for removing cellular cholesterol . DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) mediates transport of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) apolipoproteins , such as apoA-I . O95477 mutations can cause a severe HDL deficiency and atherosclerosis . Here we show that the protein-tyrosine kinase ( TK ) O60674 ( O60674 ) modulates the apolipoprotein interactions with O95477 required for removing cellular lipids . The protein kinase A ( PKA ) inhibitor H89 , the TK inhibitor genistein , and the O60674 inhibitor AG490 suppressed apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from O95477 -expressing cells without altering the membrane O95477 content . Whereas PKA inhibition had no effect on apoA-I binding to cells or to O95477 , TK and O60674 inhibition greatly reduced these activities . Conversely , PKA but not O60674 inhibition significantly reduced the intrinsic cholesterol translocase activity of O95477 . Mutant cells lacking O60674 had a severely impaired apoA-I-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and apoA-I binding despite normal O95477 protein levels and near normal cholesterol translocase activity . Thus , although PKA modulates O95477 lipid transport activity , O60674 appears to selectively modulate apolipoprotein interactions with O95477 . TK-mediated phosphorylation of O95477 was undetectable , implicating the involvement of another O60674 -targeted protein . Acute incubation of O95477 -expressing cells with apoA-I had no effect on O95477 phosphorylation but stimulated O60674 autophosphorylation . These results suggest that the interaction of apolipoproteins with O95477 -expressing cells activates O60674 , which in turn activates a process that enhances apolipoprotein interactions with O95477 and lipid removal from cells .
