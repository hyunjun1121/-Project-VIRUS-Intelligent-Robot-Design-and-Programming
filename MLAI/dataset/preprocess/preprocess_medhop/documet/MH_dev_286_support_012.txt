Phosphorylation of calmodulin by the epidermal-growth-factor-receptor tyrosine kinase . An epidermal-growth-factor( P01133 )-receptor preparation isolated by calmodulin-affinity chromatography from rat liver plasma membranes is able to phosphorylate calmodulin . P62158 phosphorylation was enhanced 3-8-fold by P01133 , was dependent on the presence of a polycation or basic protein and was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ . Phosphate incorporation into calmodulin occurs predominantly on tyrosine residues . Partial proteolysis of phosphocalmodulin by thrombin identifies Tyr99 , located in the third calcium-binding domain of calmodulin , as the phosphorylated residue . Stoichiometric measurements show a 32P/calmodulin molar ratio of approximately 1 when optimal phosphorylation conditions are used .
