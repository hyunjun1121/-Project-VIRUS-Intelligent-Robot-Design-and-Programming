Increased P05231 levels in pituitary-deficient patients are independently related to their carotid intima-media thickness . OBJECTIVE : Increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been observed in patients with pituitary deficiency and untreated growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) . We investigated peripheral inflammatory and fibrinolytic markers and their associations with arterial intima-media thickness ( IMT ) in GHD . DESIGN : Cross-sectional study . PATIENTS : Thirty-four patients with GHD , but without cardiovascular disease , were compared to healthy controls matched for age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) and smoking habits . MEASUREMENTS : IMT of the common carotid artery , P02741 ( CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , fibrinogen , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) activity and tissue plasminogen activator antigen ( tPA-ag ) were measured . RESULTS : Median P05231 concentrations were increased by 208 % and 248 % in GHD patients compared to BMI-matched and nonobese controls , respectively . Median CRP and tPA-ag levels were increased by 237 % and 167 % in patients compared to nonobese controls , but not significantly different compared to BMI-matched controls . Plasma levels of fibrinogen and P05121 activity did not differ between groups . Age , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , tPA-ag and P05231 were positively correlated , and P05019 was negatively correlated to IMT in the patient group , but only age and P05231 were independently related to IMT . CONCLUSIONS : P05231 concentrations were increased in GHD patients compared to controls and independently related to IMT in patients . This finding may help to explain the variance in IMT and the increased vascular morbidity and mortality in hypopituitary patients with GHD .
