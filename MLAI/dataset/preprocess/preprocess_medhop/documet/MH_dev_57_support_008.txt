Oleanolic acid is a selective farnesoid X receptor modulator . Oleanolic acid ( OA ) is an ingredient found in some Traditional Chinese Medicine remedies for treating liver ailments . Bile acid biosynthesis and catabolism are in part controlled in the liver by transcription factor farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) . It was hypothesized that OA may act through Q96RI1 to mediate some of its beneficial health effects . In this study , it was found that OA bound to the ligand binding domain ( LBD ) of Q96RI1 and blocked its ability to interact with coactivator Q9Y6Q9 . OA also dose-dependently suppressed the activity of Q96RI1 -LBD induced by its endogenous ligand chenodoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) . Consistently , OA partially blocked the ability of DB06777 to induce a Q96RI1 target gene bile salt export protein ( O95342 ) . On the other hand , OA did not affect the expression of another Q96RI1 target gene organic solute transporter ( Q86UW2 ) . Intriguingly , OA modestly enhanced the expression of a third Q96RI1 target gene short heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) . This evidence collectively suggested that OA acts as a gene selective modulator of Q96RI1 .
