Tunicamycin and neuraminidase effects on luteinizing hormone ( LH ) -releasing hormone binding and LH release from rat pituitary cells in culture . We have studied the effects of tunicamycin ( TM ) and neuraminidase on the binding of 125I-labeled DB06719 , a DB00644 agonist , and on DB00644 -stimulated LH release in cultured rat pituitary cells . Treatment with TM , an antibiotic which inhibits protein glycosylation , abolished the development of elongated cell processes without any effect on cell viability . Concomitantly , TM caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of specific binding of DB06719 and of DB00644 -stimulated LH release . The inhibition of binding was due to a decrease in the number of DB00644 receptors without any significant effect on binding affinity . Protein synthesis was not affected under these experimental conditions , suggesting that the aglycosylated DB00644 receptors are probably intracellularly accumulated and are not expressed on the cell surface . Treatment with neuraminidase inhibited only 50 % of DB00644 agonist binding and did not affect DB00644 -stimulated LH release . These results indicate that the oligosaccharide portion is essential for the functional properties of the P30968 .
