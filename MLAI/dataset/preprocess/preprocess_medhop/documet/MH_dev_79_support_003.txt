Serotonin and vasopressin interact in the hypothalamus to control communicative behavior . The present study investigated whether serotonin ( 5-HT ) agonists could inhibit the ability of arginine-vasopressin ( AVP ) to induce a form of scent marking called flank marking by their actions in the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamus ( MPOA-AH ) . DOI , a 5- Q13049 ,2B,2C receptor agonist , did not inhibit AVP-induced flank marking , but mCPP a 5- Q13049 antagonist and P41595 ,2C agonist inhibited AVP-induced flank marking . In addition , the finding that 8-OH-DPAT , CGS-12066A and SC53116 also inhibited AVP-induced flank marking suggests that 5-HT could also inhibit flank marking by acting through P08908 , P34969 , P28222 and/or Q13639 receptor subtypes . These data support the hypothesis that 5-HT acts within the MPOA-AH to inhibit the ability of AVP to induce flank marking .
