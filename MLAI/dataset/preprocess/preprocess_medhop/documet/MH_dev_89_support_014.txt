Evidence of an Epigenetic Modification in Cell-cycle Arrest Caused by the Use of Ultra-highly-diluted Gonolobus Condurango Extract . OBJECTIVES : Whether the ultra-highly-diluted remedies used in homeopathy can effectively bring about modulations of gene expressions through acetylation/deacetylation of histones has not been explored . Therefore , in this study , we pointedly checked if the homeopathically-diluted anti-cancer remedy Condurango 30C ( ethanolic extract of Gonolobus condurango diluted 10(-60) times ) was capable of arresting the cell cycles in cervical cancer cells HeLa by triggering an epigenetic modification through modulation of the activity of the key enzyme histone deacetylase 2 vis-a-vis the succussed alcohol ( placebo ) control . METHODS : We checked the activity of different signal proteins ( like P38936 (WAF) , p53 , Akt , P40763 ) related to deacetylation , cell growth and differentiation by western blotting and analyzed cell-cycle arrest , if any , by fluorescence activated cell sorting . After viability assays had been performed with Condurango 30C and with a placebo , the activities of histone de-acetylase ( HDAC ) enzymes 1 and 2 were measured colorimetrically . RESULTS : While Condurango 30C induced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in vitro and reduced Q92769 activity quite strikingly , it apparently did not alter the Q13547 enzyme ; the placebo had no or negligible cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and could not alter either the HDAC 1 or 2 activity . Data on P38936 (WAF) , p53 , Akt , and P40763 activities and a cell-cycle analysis revealed a reduction in DNA synthesis and P55008 -phase cell-cycle arrest when Condurango 30C was used at a 2 % dose . CONCLUSION : Condurango 30C appeared to trigger key epigenetic events of gene modulation in effectively combating cancer cells , which the placebo was unable to do .
