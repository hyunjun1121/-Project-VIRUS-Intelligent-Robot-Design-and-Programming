Q8WZ71 and Q8WUP2 as novel marker genes of cisplatin sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer cells . Even after development of molecular targeting therapies , platinum-based chemotherapy is still a standard care for treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . So far , critical molecular markers capable to predict the therapeutic response in NSCLC patients remain undetermined . We here attempted to identify novel biomarker genes for cisplatin ( DB00515 ) for a tailored therapy . Initial screening to explorer association of IC(50) values of DB00515 obtained by MTT assay and gene expression levels measured with oligonucleotide microarray and real-time RT-PCR provided 6 candidate genes , namely , Q8TB37 , Q96H12 , P17014 , Q8WZ71 , P49841 , and Q8WUP2 using 9 lung cancer cells consisting of 3 small and 6 NSCLC cells . These 6 genes together with 5 reported biomarkers , i.e. , P09211 , P07992 , P38398 , P42345 , and P23921 , were subjected to a linear regression analysis using 12 NSCLC cell lines including 6 additional NSCLC cells : only Q8WUP2 and Q8WZ71 genes showed positive associations with statistical significances ( P = .016 and .026 , respectively ) . The biological significance of these genes was explored by in vitro experiments : Knockdown experiments in PC-9/ DB00515 cells revealed that the reduced expression of Q8WZ71 significantly decreased the chemo-resistance against DB00515 ( P < .0001 ) , while 2 transformants of PC-6 cells stably over-expressing Q8WUP2 resulted in an enhanced resistance to DB00515 ( P = .004 and P = .001 ) . Furthermore , a stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated the best prediction formula could be fixed when we used expression data of Q8WZ71 and Q8WUP2 ( R(2) = 0.755 , P = .0018 ) . Q8WZ71 and Q8WUP2 may be powerful predictive biomarkers for DB00515 therapy in NSCLC .
