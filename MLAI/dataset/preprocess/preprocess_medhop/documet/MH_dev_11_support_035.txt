Urinary pheromones promote P29323 /Akt phosphorylation , regeneration and survival of vomeronasal ( P30518 ) neurons . The G protein-coupled pheromone receptor neurons ( V1R and P30518 ) of the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) are continually replaced throughout the lifetime of the mouse . Moreover , active signalling of V2Rs via the transient receptor potential 2(TRPC2) channel is necessary for regeneration of receptors , as the TRPC2 null mutant mouse showed a 75 % reduction of V2Rs by the age of two months . Here we describe P30518 mediated signalling in a neuronal line established from vomeronasal stem cells taken from postnatal female mice . Cells were immunoreactive for Galpha(o) and P30518 , whereas V1R and Galpha(i) immunoreactivity could not be detected . Biological ligands ( dilute urine and its protein fractions ) were found to increase proliferation and survival of these neurons . Dilute mouse urine but not artificial urine also induced P29323 , Akt and CREB signalling in a dose dependent way . The volatile fraction of male mouse urine alone was without effect while the fraction containing peptides ( > 5 kDa ) also stimulated P29323 and Akt phosphorylation . The P29323 , Akt and CREB phosphorylation response was sensitive to pertussis toxin , confirming the involvement of P30518 linked Galpha(o) . Dilute mouse urine or its high molecular weight protein fraction increased survival and proliferation of these neurons . Hence , urinary pheromones , which signal important social information via mature neurons , also promote survival and proliferation of their regenerating precursors . These data show that regenerating V2Rs respond to urine and the urinary peptides by activation of the Ras- P29323 and P19957 -Akt pathways , which appear to be important for vomeronasal neural survival and proliferation .
