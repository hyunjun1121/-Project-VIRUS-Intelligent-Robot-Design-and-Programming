Glucagon-like peptide-1 inhibits adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and inflammation in an obese mouse model of diabetes . AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with low-grade chronic inflammation . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( P0C6A0 ) is known to reduce insulin resistance . We investigated whether P0C6A0 has anti-inflammatory effects on adipose tissue , including adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages ( Q13315 ) . METHODS : We administered a recombinant adenovirus ( rAd ) producing P0C6A0 ( rAd- P0C6A0 ) to an ob/ob mouse model of diabetes . We examined insulin sensitivity , body fat mass , the infiltration of Q13315 and metabolic profiles . We analysed the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines , lipogenic genes , and M1 and M2 macrophage-specific genes in adipose tissue by real-time quantitative PCR . We also examined the activation of nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in vivo and in vitro . RESULTS : Fat mass , adipocyte size and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were significantly reduced in adipose tissue of rAd- P0C6A0 -treated ob/ob mice . Macrophage populations ( F4/80(+) and F4/80(+)CD11b(+)CD11c(+) cells ) , as well as the expression and production of P05231 , P01375 -α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , were significantly reduced in adipose tissue of rAd- P0C6A0 -treated ob/ob mice . Expression of M1-specific mRNAs was significantly reduced , but that of M2-specific mRNAs was unchanged in rAd- P0C6A0 -treated ob/ob mice . NF-κB and JNK activation was significantly reduced in adipose tissue of rAd- P0C6A0 -treated ob/ob mice . Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation was reduced by the P43220 agonist , exendin-4 , in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes and Q13315 . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : We suggest that P0C6A0 reduces macrophage infiltration and directly inhibits inflammatory pathways in adipocytes and Q13315 , possibly contributing to the improvement of insulin sensitivity .
