Protection of lung epithelial cells from protease-mediated injury by trappin-2 A62L , an engineered inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases . Neutrophil serine proteases ( NSPs ) , including elastase , proteinase 3 and cathepsin G , play critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung diseases . The release of excess NSPs leads to the destruction of lung tissue and an overexuberant , sustained inflammatory response . Antiproteases could be valuable tools for controlling these NSP-mediated inflammatory events . We have examined the capacity of trappin-2 A62L , a potent engineered inhibitor of all three NSPs , to protect human lung A549 epithelial cells from the deleterious effects of NSPs . Trappin-2 A62L , significantly inhibited the detachment of A549 cells and the degradation of the tight-junction proteins , P12830 , Î²-catenin and ZO-1 , induced by each individual NSP and by activated neutrophils . Trappin-2 A62L also decreased the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines P05231 and P10145 from A549 cells that had been stimulated with elastase or LPS . Trappin-2 A62D/M63L , a trappin-2 variant that has no antiprotease activity , has similar properties , suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action of trappin-2 is independent of its antiprotease activity . Interestingly , we present evidence that trappin-2 A62L , as well as wild-type trappin-2 , enter A549 cells and move rapidly to the cytoplasm and nucleus , where they are likely to exert their anti-inflammatory effects . We have also demonstrated that trappin-2 A62L inhibits the early apoptosis of A549 cells mediated by NSPs . Thus , our data indicate that trappin-2 A62L is a powerful anti-protease and anti-inflammatory agent that could be used to develop a treatment for patients with inflammatory lung diseases .
