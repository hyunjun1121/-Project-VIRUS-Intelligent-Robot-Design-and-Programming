Insights into the roles of cyclophilin A during influenza virus infection . P62937 ( CypA ) is the main member of the immunophilin superfamily that has peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity . CypA participates in protein folding , cell signaling , inflammation and tumorigenesis . Further , CypA plays critical roles in the replication of several viruses . Upon influenza virus infection , CypA inhibits viral replication by interacting with the M1 protein . In addition , CypA is incorporated into the influenza virus virions . Finally , DB00091 ( DB00091 ) , the main inhibitor of CypA , inhibits influenza virus replication through CypA-dependent and -independent pathways . This review briefly summarizes recent advances in understanding the roles of CypA during influenza virus infection .
