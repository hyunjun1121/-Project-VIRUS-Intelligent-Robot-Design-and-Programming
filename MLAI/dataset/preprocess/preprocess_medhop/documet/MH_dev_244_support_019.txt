[ Antibacterial activity of 16 antibiotics against Helicobacter pylori ] . The susceptibilities of 24 Helicobacter pylori isolates , which were originated from clinical materials , to 5 beta-lactam antibiotics [ benzylpenicillin ( DB01053 ) , ampicillin ( DB00415 ) , cephalothin ( DB00456 ) , ceftazidime ( DB00438 ) , cefotiam ( DB00229 ) and imipenem ( IPM ) ] , two macrolides [ clarithromycin ( P62158 ) and rokitamycin ( RKM ) ] , two aminoglycosides [ amikacin ( AMK ) and gentamicin ( GM ) ] , two new quinolones [ ciprofloxacin ( CPFX ) and levofloxacin ( LVFX ) ] , two tetracycline [ tetracycline ( TC ) and minocycline ( MINO ) ] , rifampicin ( Q9HBH0 ) and chloramphenicol ( CP ) were tested . All of the isolates showed similar susceptibilities against beta-lactam antibiotics . However , MICs of DB00229 and DB00438 were two- to four-fold higher than those of DB01053 , DB00415 , DB00456 and IPM , MICs of rokitamycin for the tested strains were higher than those of clarithromycin . MICs of CPFX and LVFX showed two-modal distributions . The first peak of distributions was observed between 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml and second one was between 4 to 16 micrograms/ml . These distributions suggested that MIC values of 4 to 16 micrograms/ml could result from the expression of a resistance mechanism . In addition , some of H. pylori strains were observed drug resistances between CP and AMK , new quinolones and AMK respectively . From the molecular epidemiological study , cryptic plasmids were detected from the 3 isolates among 24 strains tested .
