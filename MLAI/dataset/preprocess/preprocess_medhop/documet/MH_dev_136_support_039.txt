Synergistic cytotoxicity of radiation and oncolytic Lister strain vaccinia in (V600D/E) P15056 mutant melanoma depends on JNK and P01375 -α signaling . Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that carries an extremely poor prognosis when local invasion , nodal spread or systemic metastasis has occurred . Recent advances in melanoma biology have revealed that DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 signaling has a pivotal role in governing disease progression and treatment resistance . Proof-of-concept clinical studies have shown that direct P15056 inhibition yields impressive responses in advanced disease but these are short-lived as treatment resistance rapidly emerges . Therefore , there is a pressing need to develop new targeted strategies for P15056 mutant melanoma . As such , oncolytic viruses represent a promising cancer-specific approach with significant activity in melanoma . This study investigated interactions between genetically-modified vaccinia virus ( GLV-1h68 ) and radiotherapy in melanoma cell lines with P15056 mutant , Ras mutant or wild-type genotype . Preclinical studies revealed that GLV-1h68 combined with radiotherapy significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis relative to either single agent in (V600D) P15056 /(V600E) P15056 mutant melanoma in vitro and in vivo . The mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity with GLV-1h68/radiation ( RT ) was independent of viral replication and due to attenuation of JNK , p38 and P29323 MAPK phosphorylation specifically in P15056 mutant cells . Further studies showed that JNK pathway inhibition sensitized P15056 mutant cells to GLV-1h68-mediated cell death , mimicking the effect of RT . GLV-1h68 infection activated MAPK signaling in (V600D) P15056 /(V600E) P15056 mutant cell lines and this was associated with P01375 -α secretion which , in turn , provided a prosurvival signal . Combination GLV-1h68/RT ( or GLV-1h68/JNK inhibition ) caused abrogation of P01375 -α secretion . These data provide a strong rationale for combining GLV-1h68 with irradiation in (V600D/E) P15056 mutant tumors .
