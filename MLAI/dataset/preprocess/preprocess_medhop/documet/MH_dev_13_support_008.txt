Further evidence for a functional role of the glutamate receptor gene Q14832 in schizophrenia . In recent years , evidence has been accumulating indicating a major role of glutamate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia . Of particular importance in this regard are the metabotropic glutamate receptors ( GRM ) . Thus , a recently published trial of the amino acid analogue DB05096 , which exerts its effects through the activation of the glutamate receptors Q14832 / Q14416 , showed an improvement of positive and negative symptoms comparable to treatment with olanzapine . A functional variant of Q14832 has been described which modulates synaptic glutamate levels . We assessed whether this functional variant rs6465084 is related to schizophrenia in a large sample of patients and controls . We found an increased frequency of the A allele ( p=0.027 ) and the AA genotype ( p=0.024 ) in schizophrenia patients . Moreover , in an assessment of schizophrenia endophenotypes , patients of the AA genotype performed poorly in the digit symbol test , a measure of attention ( p=0.008 ) . Our results provide further evidence for the potential importance of the glutamate receptor Q14832 in schizophrenia , and indicate that the novel antipsychotic DB05096 may actually be targeting a pathogenic pathway of schizophrenia .
