The relationship between gastric motility and nausea : gastric prokinetic agents as treatments . Nausea is one of a cluster of symptoms described subjectively by patients with delayed gastric emptying . The mechanisms and treatments are unclear ( anti-emetic drugs are not fully effective against nausea ) . Can nausea be relieved by stimulating gastric emptying ? Physostigmine ( together with atropine ) has been shown experimentally to stimulate gastric motility , relieve nausea and restore normal gastric motility . Is this mimicked by gastric prokinetic drugs ? The answer is complicated by mixed pharmacology . DB01233 increases gastric motility by activating myenteric Q13639 receptors but also directly inhibits vomiting via D2 and 5- Q9H205 receptor antagonism ; relationships between increased gastric motility and relief from nausea are therefore unclear . Similarly , the D2 receptor antagonist domperidone has direct anti-emetic activity . Nevertheless , more selective Q13639 and motilin receptor agonists ( erythromycin , directly stimulating gastric motility ) inhibit vomiting in animals ; low doses of erythromycin can also relieve symptoms in patients with gastroparesis . Ghrelin stimulates gastric motility and appetite mostly via vagus-dependent pathways , and inhibits vomiting in animals . To date , ghrelin receptor activation has failed to consistently improve gastric emptying or symptoms in patients with gastroparesis . We conclude that nausea can be relieved by gastric prokinetic drugs , but more clinical studies are needed using drugs with selective activity . Other mechanisms ( e.g. ghrelin , vagal and central pathways , influencing a mechanistic continuum between appetite and nausea ) also require exploration . These and other issues will be further explored in a forthcoming special issue of the European Journal of Pharmacology , which focusses on mechanisms of nausea and vomiting .
