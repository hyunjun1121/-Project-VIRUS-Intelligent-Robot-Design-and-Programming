3D Q99707 measurement : from 1.5 T to 3.0 T . This study investigates some of the issues involved in magnetization transfer ratio ( Q99707 ) acquisition , and in particular aims to determine whether high quality in vivo Q99707 measurements can be made at 3.0 T . The dependency of the Q99707 white-to-grey matter contrast to noise ratio ( P21554 ) on MT pulse characteristics at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T was investigated using an established two-pool model for MT . The simulations showed that MT pulse parameters optimizing the P21554 can be derived for both field strengths . Both the SNR and the P21554 of Q99707 maps at 3.0 T were increased compared to 1.5 T . Images obtained using a safe in vivo Q99707 acquisition protocol based on results of simulations at 3.0 T are presented .
