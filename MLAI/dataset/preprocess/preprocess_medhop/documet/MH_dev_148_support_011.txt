Candidate genes for cannabis use disorders : findings , challenges and directions . AIM : Twin studies have shown that cannabis use disorders ( abuse/dependence ) are highly heritable . This review aims to : ( i ) review existing linkage studies of cannabis use disorders and ( ii ) review gene association studies , to identify potential candidate genes , including those that have been tested for composite substance use disorders and ( iii ) to highlight challenges in the genomic study of cannabis use disorders . METHODS : Peer-reviewed linkage and candidate gene association studies are reviewed . RESULTS : Four linkage studies are reviewed : results from these have homed in on regions on chromosomes 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 and 18 , which harbor candidates of predicted biological relevance , such as monoglyceride lipase ( Q99685 ) on chromosome 3 , but also novel genes , including Q9HBW9 [ epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) , latrophilin and seven transmembrane domain containing 1 ] on chromosome 1 . Gene association studies are presented for ( a ) genes posited to have specific influences on cannabis use disorders : P21554 , CB2 , FAAH , Q99685 , Q8NER1 and Q9Y2T6 and ( b ) genes from various neurotransmitter systems that are likely to exert a non-specific influence on risk of cannabis use disorders , e.g. P47869 , P14416 and P35372 . CONCLUSIONS : There are challenges associated with ( i ) understanding biological complexity underlying cannabis use disorders ( including the need to study gene-gene and gene-environment interactions ) , ( ii ) using diagnostic versus quantitative phenotypes , ( iii ) delineating which stage of cannabis involvement ( e.g. use versus misuse ) genes influence and ( iv ) problems of sample ascertainment .
