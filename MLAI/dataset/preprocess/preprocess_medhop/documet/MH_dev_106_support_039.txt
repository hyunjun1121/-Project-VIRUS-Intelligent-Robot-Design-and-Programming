P04818 genotype-directed chemotherapy for patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers . BACKGROUND : Retrospective studies indicate associations between TSER ( thymidylate synthase enhancer region ) genotypes and clinical outcomes in patients receiving DB00544 based chemotherapy , but well-controlled prospective validation has been lacking . METHODS : In this phase II study ( NCT00515216 registered through ClinicalTrials.gov , http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00515216 ) , patients with " good risk " TSER genotypes ( at least one TSER*2 allele ) were treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy to determine whether prospective patient selection can improve overall response rates ( ORR ) in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancers , compared with historical outcomes in unselected patients ( estimated 43 % ) . RESULTS : The ORR in genotype-selected patients was Q04695 % ( 9 partial responses out of 23 evaluable patients , 95 % CI , 22.2 to 59.2 ) , not achieving the primary objective of improving ORR . An encouraging disease control rate ( DCR , consisting of partial responses and stable diseases ) of 95.7 % was noted and patients with homozygous TSER*2 genotype showed better tumor response . CONCLUSIONS : In this first prospective , multi-institutional study in patients with gastric or GEJ cancers , selecting patients with at least one TSER*2 allele did not improve the ORR but led to an encouraging DCR . Further studies are needed to investigate the utility of selecting patients homozygous for the TSER*2 allele and additional genomic markers in improving clinical outcomes for patients with gastric and GEJ cancers .
