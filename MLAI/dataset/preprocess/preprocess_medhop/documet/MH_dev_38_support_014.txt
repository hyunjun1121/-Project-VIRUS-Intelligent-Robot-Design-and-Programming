Immunocytochemical localization of Q9UBS5 receptor subunits in the basolateral amygdala . Gamma-aminobutyric acid B ( GABAB ) receptors ( GBRs ) are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate a slow , prolonged form of inhibition in the basolateral amygdala ( P00519 ) and other brain areas . Recent studies indicate that this receptor is a heterodimer consisting of Q9UBS5 ( GBR1 ) and O75899 subunits . In the present investigation , antibodies to the Q9UBS5 subunit were used to study the neuronal localization of GBRs in the rat P00519 . GBR immunoreactivity was mainly found in spine-sparse interneurons and astrocytes at the light microscopic level . Very few pyramidal neurons exhibited perikaryal staining . Dual-labeling immunofluorescence analysis indicated that each of the four main subpopulations of interneurons exhibited GBR immunoreactivity . Virtually 100 % of large CCK+ neurons in the basolateral and lateral nuclei were GBR+ . In the basolateral nucleus 72 % of somatostatin ( Q8TE85 ) , 73 % of parvalbumin ( PV ) and 25 % of P01282 positive interneurons were GBR+ . In the lateral nucleus 50 % of somatostatin , 30 % of parvalbumin and 27 % of P01282 positive interneurons were GBR+ . Electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis revealed that most of the light neuropil staining seen at the light microscopic level was due to the staining of dendritic shafts and spines , most of which probably belonged to spiny pyramidal cells . Very few axon terminals ( Ats ) were GBR+ . In summary , this investigation demonstrates that the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells , and varying percentages of each of the four main subpopulations of interneurons in the P00519 , express GBRs . Because previous studies suggest that GBR-mediated inhibition modulates DB01221 -dependent EPSPs in the P00519 , these receptors may play an important role in neuronal plasticity related to emotional learning .
