DB00945 -triggered lipoxin in patients treated with aspirin and selective vs. nonselective P35354 inhibitors . AIMS : Cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 inhibition has been reported to suppress the biosynthesis of the gastroprotective lipoxygenase metabolite 15(R)-epi-lipoxin A(4) , also termed ' aspirin-triggered lipoxin ' ( ATL ) . We tested the hypothesis that the co-administration of aspirin with either the selective P35354 inhibitor celecoxib or the nonselective P36551 inhibitor ibuprofen reduces ATL biosynthesis . METHODS : We measured the urinary excretion of ATL in 24 patients with both ischaemic heart disease and osteoarthritis , chronically treated with aspirin and co-administered celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d. , ibuprofen 600 mg t.i.d. , or placebo for 7 days . RESULTS : Baseline ATL was comparable in the three groups . On days 1 and 7 , 4 h after co-administration of celecoxib or ibuprofen , ATL levels did not show significant variations ( day 1 : 0.24 +/- 0.33 , 0.26 +/- 0.21 and 0.37 +/- 0.22 ng mg(-1) creatinine , respectively ; day 7 : 0.21 +/- 0.13 , 0.35 +/- 0.15 and 0.23 +/- 0.18 ng mg(-1) creatinine , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS : Neither selective nor nonselective P35354 inhibition appreciably interferes with ATL biosynthesis , suggesting that this mediator is not involved in exacerbating gastrotoxicity by the association of aspirin with P35354 inhibitors .
