Drugs targeting nitric oxide synthase for migraine treatment . INTRODUCTION : Ample evidence that nitric oxide ( NO ) is a causative molecule in migraine has encouraged research to develop drugs that target the NO-cGMP cascade for migraine treatment . NO synthase ( NOS ) inhibition is an innovative therapeutic principle . AREAS COVERED : This paper reviews the rationale underlying NOS inhibition in migraine treatment . It also provides a review on the efficacy and safety data for NOS inhibitors ( nonselective NOS inhibitor L-N(G)-methyl-arginine hydrochloride [ L-NMMA ] , selective inducible NOS [ P35228 ] inhibitors GW273629 and GW274150 , combined neuronal NOS [ P29475 ] inhibitor and P28222 /1D receptor agonist DB06096 ) in acute or preventive migraine treatment . EXPERT OPINION : The data highlighted herein , from four placebo-controlled trials and 1 open-labeled clinical trial using 4 different NOS inhibitors on a total of 705 patients , provide convincing efficacy data only for the nonselective NOS inhibitor L-NMMA . Unfortunately , this NOS inhibitor raises cardiovascular safety concerns and has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile . As experimental studies predicted , P35228 inhibitors are ineffective in migraine . Still , upcoming selective P29475 inhibitors are a hope for migraine treatment , with the P29475 isoform being most clearly involved in trigeminovascular transmission and central sensitization . Future studies should help to clarify whether NOS inhibition is equally fruitful in acute and preventive treatment . It should also clarify if P29475 inhibition holds promise as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of chronic migraine and other forms of headache .
