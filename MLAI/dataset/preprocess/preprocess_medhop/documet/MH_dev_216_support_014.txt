Differential antiinflammatory and antinociceptive effects of the somatostatin analogs octreotide and pasireotide in a mouse model of immune-mediated arthritis . OBJECTIVE : Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that somatostatin exhibits potent antiinflammatory and antinociceptive properties . However , it is not known which of the 5 somatostatin receptor subtypes ( SSTRs 1-5 ) is involved in these actions . The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the stable somatostatin analogs octreotide and pasireotide ( DB06663 ) in a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis ( AIA ) . METHODS : Studies were performed in P30874 -deficient mice ( P30874 (-/-) ) and their wild-type littermates ( P30874 (+/+) ) . The expression of P30872 , SSTR2A , P32745 , and P35346 in dorsal root ganglia was examined by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS : Untreated P30874 (-/-) mice with AIA displayed joint swelling and mechanical hyperalgesia similar to that seen in P30874 (+/+) mice . In wild-type mice , both octreotide and pasireotide significantly attenuated knee joint swelling and histopathologic manifestations of arthritis to an extent comparable to that of dexamethasone . In P30874 (-/-) mice , the antiinflammatory effects of both octreotide and pasireotide were completely abrogated . Prolonged administration of pasireotide also inhibited joint swelling and protected against joint destruction during AIA flare reactions . In addition , both octreotide and pasireotide reduced inflammatory hyperalgesia . The antinociceptive actions of octreotide were abolished in P30874 (-/-) mice , but those of pasireotide were retained . In dorsal root ganglia of naive wild-type mice , only P30872 and SSTR2A , but not P32745 or P35346 , were detected in a subset of small- and medium-diameter neurons . CONCLUSION : Our findings indicate that the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory actions of octreotide and pasireotide are largely mediated via the P30874 receptor . In addition , we identified the P30872 receptor as a novel pharmacologic target for somatostatin-mediated peripheral analgesia in inflammatory pain .
