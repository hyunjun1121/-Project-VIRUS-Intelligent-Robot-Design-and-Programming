DB01017 modulates cytokine and gene expression profiles in the brain after whole-body exposure to radiation . An effective countermeasure against radiation damage to normal tissues is urgently needed . The major goal of the present study was to determine if minocycline could modify the immunomodulatory effects of radiation on the brain . C57BL/6 mice were treated with minocycline intraperitoneally for 5 days beginning immediately before total-body exposure to 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 Gray ( Gy ) (60)Co γ-rays . Brains were collected on days 4 and 32 post-irradiation for cytokine and gene analyses . DB01017 treatment significantly increased the levels of interleukin ( IL ) -10 , P40933 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) in the brain on day 4 in one or more irradiated groups compared to radiation-alone ( p < 0.05 ) . P22301 is anti-inflammatory , P40933 can prevent apoptosis and P15692 is nuroprotective . On day 32 , the drug decreased IL-1β in the 2- Gy group ( p < 0.05 vs. 2-Gy alone ) ; this cytokine is implicated in immune-related central nervous system pathologies . Microarray analysis of brains on day 32 showed that while radiation increased expression of inflammatory genes such as Il1f10 , Il17 , Tnfrsf11b , Tnfsf12 , Il12b and Il1f8 , these were no longer up-regulated in the minocycline-treated groups . Similarly , the pro-apoptotic gene Bik and nitric oxide synthase producer ( Q8IVI9 ) were no longer up-regulated in the drug-treated groups . Pathway analysis based on gene data suggested that catenin-β1 and tumor suppressor-related transcription regulation were significantly activated by radiation and/or minocycline ( activation z-score > 2.0 ) . Overall , the data warrant further testing of minocycline as a potential neuroprotectant against radiation-induced damage .
