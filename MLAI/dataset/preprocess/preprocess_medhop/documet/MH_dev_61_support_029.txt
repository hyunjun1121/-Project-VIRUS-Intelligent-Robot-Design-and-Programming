Evaluation of human astrocytoma and glioblastoma cell lines for nerve growth factor release . Nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) prevents degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , and has potential as a therapeutic treatment for Alzheimer 's disease . The inability of P01138 to cross the blood-brain barrier has prompted pharmacological approaches investigating peripherally administered compounds that stimulate release of endogenous P01138 . This study describes the P01138 -releasing properties of six human astrocytoma and glioblastoma cell lines ( SW 1088 , SW 1783 and CRL 1718 astrocytomas , and U-138 , U-373 , and T98G glioblastomas ) . Using a highly specific two-site ELISA for human P01138 , basal P01138 release could be detected in all cell lines , with the lowest level in the T98G line ( approximately 80 pg P01138 /ml ) . Cell lines tested with a variety of compounds for 24 h in serum-free media demonstrated stimulation of P01138 release by distinct mechanisms . P01138 levels were markedly elevated ( up to 8-fold above vehicle-treated cells ) when stimulated with the cytokine interleukin-1 beta ( P01584 ) . Phorbol ester stimulated P01138 release 4-fold . DB01407 , 4-methyl catechol , and propentofylline had little activity , while 6-(4-hydroxybutyl)-2,3,5,-trimethyl-1,4,benzoquinone ( DB01157 ) , dexamethasone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 elevated P01138 levels 3-fold . These data indicate differences in the ability of human astrocytoma and glioblastoma cells to release P01138 when stimulated with mechanistically distinct compounds .
