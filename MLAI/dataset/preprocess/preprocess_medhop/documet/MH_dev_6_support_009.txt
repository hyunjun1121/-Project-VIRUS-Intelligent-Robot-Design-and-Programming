Endothelin receptor antagonists as disease modifiers in systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a multisystem connective tissue disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation , vascular dysfunction and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs . SSc is clinically diverse both in terms of the burden of skin and organ involvement and the rate of progression of the disease . Recent studies indicate that the endothelin system , especially ET-1 and the P25101 and ETB receptors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SSc . A new class of drugs , endothelin receptor antagonists has been introduced for treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . DB00559 , a dual endothelin receptor antagonist as well as DB06268 and DB06403 , selective blockers of the P25101 receptor have proven effective in SSc-PAH . This effect may be mediated through both a vasodilatory and antifibrotic effect , thus making these agents attractive as potential disease modifying agents for SSc .
