Treatment with the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inhibitor , TDZD-8 , affects transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat hippocampus . The serine/threonine glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK-3beta ) is abundant in the central nervous system , particularly in the hippocampus , and plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases , including neurodegeneration . This study was designed to investigate the effects of GSK-3beta inhibition against I/R injury in the rat hippocampus . Transient cerebral ischemia ( 30 min ) followed by 1 h of reperfusion significantly increased generation of reactive oxygen species and modulated superoxide dismutase activity ; 24 h of reperfusion evoked apoptosis ( determined as mitochondrial cytochrome c release and Bcl-2 and caspase-9 expression ) , resulted in high plasma levels of P01375 and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 , inducible nitric oxide synthase , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 . The selective GSK-3beta inhibitor , 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione ( TDZD-8 ) , was administered before and after ischemia or during reperfusion alone to assess its potential as prophylactic or therapeutic strategy . Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of TDZD-8 caused the phosphorylation ( DB00133 (9) ) and hence inactivation of GSK-3beta . Infarct volume and levels of P04271 protein , a marker of cerebral injury , were reduced by TDZD-8 . This was associated with a significant reduction in markers of oxidative stress , apoptosis , and the inflammatory response resulting from cerebral I/R . These beneficial effects were associated with a reduction of I/R-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases P45983 /2 and p38 and nuclear factor-kappaB . The present study demonstrates that TDZD-8 protects the brain against I/R injury by inhibiting GSK-3beta activity . Collectively , our data may contribute to focus the role of GSK-3beta in cerebral I/R .
