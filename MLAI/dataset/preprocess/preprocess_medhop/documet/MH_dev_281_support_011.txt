Peroxisomal and mitochondrial targeting of serine:pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase in rat liver . DB00133 :pyruvate/alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase ( P21549 or P21549 /AGT ) of rat liver is a unique enzyme of dual subcellular localization , and exists in both mitochondria and peroxisomes . To characterize a peroxisomal targeting signal of rat liver P21549 , a number of C-terminal mutants were constructed and their subcellular localization in transfected COS-1 cells was examined . Deletion of C-terminal Q9BZE0 , and point mutation of K2 ( the second Lys from the C-terminus ) , P19013 and E15 caused accumulation of translated products in the cytoplasm . This suggests that the Q03393 of P21549 is not identical to PTS1 ( the C-terminal SKL motif ) in that it is not restricted to the C-terminal tripeptide . In vitro synthesized precursor for mitochondrial P21549 was highly sensitive to the proteinase K digestion , whereas peroxisomal P21549 ( SPTp ) was fairly resistant to the protease . In in vitro import experiment with purified peroxisomes , however , SPTp recovered in the peroxisomal fraction was very sensitive to the protease . These results suggest that the mitochondrial precursor is synthesized as an unfolded form and is translocated into the mitochondrial matrix , whereas SPTp is synthesized as a folded form and its conformation changes to an unfolded form just before translocation into peroxisomes .
