Influence of immunomodulatory drugs on the cytotoxicity induced by monoclonal antibody 17-1A and interleukin-2 . Patients treated with monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for cancer receive often co-medication , which may influence treatment efficacy . Therefore , we investigated with a flowcytometric cytotoxicity assay the effect of several immunomodulatory drugs on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , interleukin-2 ( P60568 ) induced cytotoxicity and P60568 -induced-ADCC . We found that dexamethasone markedly inhibited the P60568 induced cytotoxicity and the P60568 -induced-ADCC . DB00904 , a P46098 serotonin receptor antagonist augmented significantly ADCC . Clemastine , a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist augmented the P60568 -induced-ADCC . The P01375 antagonist thalidomide suppressed ADCC whereas pentoxifylline proved to be ineffective . Other tested drugs namely ibuprofen and indomethacin , both prostaglandin E2 antagonists , cimetidine a histamine type-2 receptor antagonist , the opioid pethidine , prostaglandin E2 and histamine exerted minor effects or had no influence on the tested parameters . We conclude that glucocorticosteroids should be avoided with monoclonal antibody and cytokine treatment . According to our in vitro data the other drugs tested did not have a negative impact on cellular cytotoxicity and ADCC .
