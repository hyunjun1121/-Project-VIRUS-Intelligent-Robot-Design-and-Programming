Immunotherapy of murine leukemia following non-myeloablative conditioning with naÃ¯ve or G- P04141 mobilized blood or bone marrow stem cells . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) is the treatment of choice for a large number of hematologic malignancies . Its major advantage over conventional chemotherapy lies in the graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effects mediated by allo- or tumor-reactive donor lymphocytes given in the course of P09683 or post transplantation as donor lymphocyte infusions ( DLI ) . The benefits of cell-mediated immunotherapy over myeloablative radiochemotherapy have also made it possible to reduce the intensity of conditioning regimens . Mobilized peripheral blood has proved preferable to bone marrow ( BM ) as a source of stem cells for transplantation , since it provides a larger number of stem cells on the one hand and immunologically competent lymphocytes on the other . The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) , which is necessary to mobilize and increase the number of stem cells , may down-regulate the GVL effect by suppression of donor effector T lymphocytes by inducing Th1 --> Th2 cytokine switch . It has previously been shown that GVL effects may be amplified by both in vivo and in vitro activation of donor lymphocytes with human recombinant interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) . Our studies using a leukemic murine model prepared for transplantation with low intensity conditioning prior to infusion of G- P04141 -mobilized peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC ) have demonstrated that mobilization of blood cells with G- P04141 and in vivo treatment with rIL-2 following low-intensity conditioning enhances the GVL effects and prolongs survival of recipients inoculated with P24385 . Activation of donor lymphocytes with rIL-2 may thus be useful for amplifying GVL effects following mobilization with DB00099 .
