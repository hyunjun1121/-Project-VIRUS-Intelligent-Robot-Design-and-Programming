CREB-Dependent Regulation of Q05329 Transcription by P23560 /TrkB in Cortical Interneurons . In the cerebral cortex , the functional output of projection neurons is fine-tuned by inhibitory neurons present in the network , which use Î³-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) as their main neurotransmitter . Previous studies have suggested that the expression levels of the rate-limiting GABA synthetic enzyme , Q05329 , depend on brain derived neurotrophic factor ( P23560 ) /TrkB activation . However , the molecular mechanisms by which this neurotrophic factor and its receptor controls GABA synthesis are still unknown . Here , we show a direct regulation of the Q05329 gene by P23560 -TrkB signaling via CREB in cortical interneurons . Conditional ablation of TrkB in cortical interneurons causes a cell-autonomous decrease in the synaptically enriched Q05329 protein and its transcripts levels , suggesting that transcriptional regulation of the Q05329 gene is altered . Dissection of the intracellular pathway that underlies this process revealed that P23560 /TrkB signaling controls the transcription of Q05329 in a Ras- P29323 -CREB-dependent manner . Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism through which P23560 /TrkB signaling may modulate the maturation and function of cortical inhibitory circuits .
