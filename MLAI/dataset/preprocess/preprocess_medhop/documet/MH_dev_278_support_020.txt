Differential recruitment of coregulator proteins steroid receptor coactivator-1 and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors to the estrogen receptor-estrogen response element by beta-estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen in human breast cancer . P03372 ( ER ) -alpha and Q92731 function as transcription factors , and both interact with nuclear regulatory proteins to enhance or inhibit transcription . We hypothesized that coregulators are expressed in breast cancer and may be differentially recruited by ERs in the presence of estrogen and tamoxifen . Q92731 was found to be expressed more frequently in node-negative patients ( P < 0.05 ) . Expression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) was associated with nodal positivity ( P < 0.05 ) and resistance to endocrine treatment ( P < 0.001 ) . The spatial coexpression of P03372 , Q92731 , and the coregulatory proteins was established using immunofluorescence . In both cell lines ( MCF-7 and T47D ) and in primary breast cancer cell cultures , beta-estradiol up-regulated Q92731 and coregulator protein expression and increased P03372 / Q92731 interaction with the estrogen response element ( ERE ) . 4- Hydroxy-tamoxifen ( DB04468 ) increased P03372 and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors ( Q9Y618 ) expression and increased ER-ERE binding . Q15788 and Q9Y618 were identified at the ER-ERE complex , and interactions between ER isoforms and coregulatory proteins were determined using immunoprecipitation . Both P03372 and Q92731 preferentially bound Q15788 in the presence of beta-estradiol . Conversely , in cells treated with DB04468 , P03372 and Q92731 bound Q9Y618 . Differential recruitment of Q15788 and Q9Y618 by P03372 and Q92731 in the presence of beta-estradiol and DB04468 may be central to the response of the tumor to endocrine treatment .
