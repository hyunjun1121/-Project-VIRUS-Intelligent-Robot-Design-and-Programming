Mechanisms of atrial-selective block of Na⁺ channels by ranolazine : I . Experimental analysis of the use-dependent block . Atrial-selective inhibition of cardiac Na(+) channel current ( I(Na) ) and I(Na)-dependent parameters has been shown to contribute to the safe and effective management of atrial fibrillation . The present study examined the basis for the atrial-selective actions of ranolazine . Whole cell I(Na) was recorded at 15°C in canine atrial and ventricular myocytes and in human embryonic kidney ( P29320 ) -293 cells expressing Q14524 . Tonic block was negligible at holding potentials from -140 to -100 mV , suggesting minimal drug interactions with the closed state . Trains of 40 pulses were elicited over a range of holding potentials to determine use-dependent block . Guarded receptor formalism was used to analyze the development of block during pulse trains . Use-dependent block by ranolazine increased at more depolarized holding potentials , consistent with an interaction of the drug with either preopen or inactivated states , but was unaffected by longer pulse durations between 5 and 200 ms , suggesting a weak interaction with the inactivated state . Block was significantly increased at shorter diastolic intervals between 20 and 200 ms . Responses in atrial and ventricular myocytes and in P29320 -293 cells displayed a similar pattern . DB00243 is an open state blocker that unbinds from closed Na(+) channels unusually fast but is trapped in the inactivated state . Kinetic rates of ranolazine interactions with different states of atrial and ventricular Na(+) channels were similar . Our data suggest that the atrial selectivity of ranolazine is due to a more negative steady-state inactivation curve , less negative resting membrane potential , and shorter diastolic intervals in atrial cells compared with ventricular cells at rapid rates .
