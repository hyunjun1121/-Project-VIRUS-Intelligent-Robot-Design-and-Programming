P49841 inhibitor suppresses Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-induced P25942 expression by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activation in mouse osteoblasts . Bone-forming osteoblasts have been recently reported capable of expressing the critical co-stimulatory molecule P25942 upon exposure to bacterial infection , which supports the unappreciated role of osteoblasts in modulating bone inflammation . Recent studies highlight the anti-inflammatory potential of glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( GSK-3β ) inhibitors ; however , their effect on osteoblasts remains largely unclear . In the present study , we showed that treatment with SB216763 , a highly specific GSK-3β inhibitor , resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the mRNA and protein expression of P25942 , as well as production of pro-inflammatory cytokines P05231 , P01375 -α and IL-1β , in the Porphyromonas gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated murine osteoblastic-like MC3T3-E1 cells . Furthermore , inhibition of GSK-3β remarkably represses the LPS-induced activation of the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) signaling pathway by suppressing IκBα phosphorylation , NF-κBp65 nuclear translocation , and NF-κBp65 DNA binding activity . Closer investigation by immunoprecipitation assay revealed that β-catenin can physically interact with NF-κBp65 . The negative regulation effect of GSK-3β inhibitor on P25942 expression is mediated through β-catenin , for siRNA of β-catenin attenuated the GSK-3β inhibitor-induced repression of NF-κB activation and , consequently , the expression of P25942 and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells . Thus our results elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby GSK-3β inhibitor prevents the LPS-induced P25942 expression on osteoblasts and provide supportive evidence of the potential role of GSK-3β inhibitors in suppressing the immune function of osteoblasts in inflammatory bone diseases .
