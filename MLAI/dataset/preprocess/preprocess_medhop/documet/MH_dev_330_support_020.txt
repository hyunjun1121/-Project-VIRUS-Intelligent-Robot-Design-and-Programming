Q13224 -containing DB01221 receptors promote glutamate synapse development in hippocampal interneurons . In postnatal development , Q13224 -containing NMDARs are critical for the functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses . Q13224 -containing NMDARs prevail until the second postnatal week when Q12879 subunits are progressively added , conferring mature properties to NMDARs . In cortical principal neurons , deletion of Q13224 results in an increase in functional AMPAR synapses , suggesting that Q13224 -containing NMDARs set a brake on glutamate synapse maturation . The function of Q13224 in the maturation of glutamatergic inputs to cortical interneurons is not known . To examine the function of Q13224 in interneurons , we generated mutant mice with conditional deletion of Q13224 in interneurons ( Q13224 (Δ Q99259 ) ) . In Q13224 (Δ Q99259 ) mice interneurons distributed normally in cortical brain regions . After the second postnatal week , Q13224 (Δ Q99259 ) mice developed hippocampal seizures and died shortly thereafter . Before the onset of seizures , Q13224 -deficient hippocampal interneurons received fewer glutamatergic synaptic inputs than littermate controls , indicating that Q13224 -containing NMDARs positively regulate the maturation of glutamatergic input synapses in interneurons . These findings suggest that Q13224 -containing NMDARs keep the circuit activity under control by promoting the maturation of excitatory synapses in interneurons .
