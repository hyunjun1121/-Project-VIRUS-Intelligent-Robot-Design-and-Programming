Alpha 2B adrenoceptor genotype moderates effect of reboxetine on negative emotional memory bias in healthy volunteers . Evidence suggests that emotional memory plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression/anxiety disorders . DB00368 crucially modulates emotional memory . Genetic variants involved in noradrenergic signaling contribute to individual differences in emotional memory and vulnerability to psychopathology . A functional deletion polymorphism in the Î±-2B adrenoceptor gene ( P18089 ) has been linked to emotional memory and post-traumatic stress disorder . The noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine attenuates enhanced memory for negative stimuli in healthy and depressed individuals . We examined whether the effect of reboxetine on emotional memory in healthy individuals would be moderated by P18089 genotype . P18089 deletion carriers demonstrated enhanced emotional memory for negative stimuli compared with deletion noncarriers , consistent with prior studies . DB00234 attenuated enhanced memory for negative stimuli in deletion noncarriers but had no significant effect in deletion carriers . This is the first demonstration of genetic variation influencing antidepressant drug effects on emotional processing in healthy humans .
