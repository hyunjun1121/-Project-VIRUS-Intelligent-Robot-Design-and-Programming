The human gonadotropin releasing hormone type I receptor is a functional intracellular GPCR expressed on the nuclear membrane . The mammalian type I gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ( P30968 ) is a structurally unique G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that lacks cytoplasmic tail sequences and displays inefficient plasma membrane expression ( PME ) . Compared to its murine counterparts , the primate type I receptor is inefficiently folded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) leading to a further reduction in PME . The decrease in PME and concomitant increase in intracellular localization of the mammalian DB00644 -RI led us to characterize the spatial distribution of the human and mouse DB00644 receptors in two human cell lines , P29320 293 and HTR-8/SVneo . In both human cell lines we found the receptors were expressed in the cytoplasm and were associated with the ER and nuclear membrane . A molecular analysis of the receptor protein sequence led us to identify a putative monopartite nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) in the first intracellular loop of DB00644 -RI . Surprisingly , however , neither the deletion of the NLS nor the addition of the Xenopus P30968 cytoplasmic tail sequences to the human receptor altered its spatial distribution . Finally , we demonstrate that DB00644 treatment of nuclei isolated from P29320 293 cells expressing exogenous DB00644 -RI triggers a significant increase in the acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 , thereby revealing that the nuclear-localized receptor is functional . Based on our findings , we conclude that the mammalian DB00644 -RI is an intracellular GPCR that is expressed on the nuclear membrane . This major and novel discovery causes us to reassess the signaling potential of this physiologically and clinically important receptor .
