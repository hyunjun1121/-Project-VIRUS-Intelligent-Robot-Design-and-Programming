Clinical perspective of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer . Reversible DB00171 -competitive inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) have been established as the most effective treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harboring " activating " mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the P00533 gene . However , clinical activity is limited by acquired resistance which on average develops within 10 months of continued treatment . The mechanisms for acquired resistance include selection of the P00533 T790M mutation in approximately 50 % of cases , and MET gene amplification , P42336 gene mutation , transdifferentiation into small-cell lung cancer and additional rare or unkown mechanisms . DB08916 is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the P00533 , P04626 and Q15303 receptor tyrosine kinases . In preclinical studies , afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating P00533 mutations , but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type P00533 or the P00533 L858R/T790M double mutant . Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program . These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with P00533 -mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib . Here we review the current status of clinical application of afatinib in NSCLC . We also discuss clinical aspects of resistance to afatinib and strategies for its circumvention .
