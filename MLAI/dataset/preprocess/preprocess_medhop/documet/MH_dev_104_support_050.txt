Adenoviral expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C induces lymphangiogenesis in the skin . The growth of blood and lymphatic vasculature is mediated in part by secreted polypeptides of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) family . The prototype P15692 binds P15692 receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 and P35968 and is angiogenic , whereas P49767 , which binds to P35968 and P35916 , is either angiogenic or lymphangiogenic in different assays . We used an adenoviral gene transfer approach to compare the effects of these growth factors in adult mice . Recombinant adenoviruses encoding human P49767 or P15692 were injected subcutaneously into C57Bl6 mice or into the ears of nude mice . Immunohistochemical analysis showed that P49767 upregulated P35968 and P35916 expression and P15692 upregulated P35968 expression at 4 days after injection . After 2 weeks , histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis , including staining for the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 ( Q9Y5Y7 ) , the vascular endothelial marker platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( P16284 ) , and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) revealed that P49767 induced mainly lymphangiogenesis in contrast to P15692 , which induced only angiogenesis . These results have significant implications in the planning of gene therapy using these growth factors .
