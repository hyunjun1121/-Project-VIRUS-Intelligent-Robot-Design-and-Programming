P62937 is required for P61073 -mediated nuclear export of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 , activation and nuclear translocation of P27361 /2 , and chemotactic cell migration . The chemokine receptor P61073 -mediated signaling cascades play an important role in cell proliferation and migration , but the underlying mechanisms by which the receptor signaling is regulated remain incompletely understood . Here , we demonstrate that P61073 was co-immunoprecipitated with cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) from the lysate of HEK293 cells stably expressing P61073 . Although both the glutathione S-transferase- P61073 N- and C-terminal fusion proteins were associated with the purified CyPA , truncation of the C-terminal domain of P61073 robustly inhibited the receptor co-immunoprecipitation with CyPA in intact cells , thereby suggesting a critical role of the receptor C terminus in this interaction . Ligand stimulation of P61073 induced CyPA phosphorylation and nuclear translocation , both of which were inhibited by truncation of the C-terminal domain of P61073 . CyPA was associated with transportin 1 , and knockdown of transportin 1 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) blocked P48061 -induced nuclear translocation of CyPA , thereby suggesting a transportin 1-mediated nuclear import of CyPA . CyPA formed a complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( hnRNP ) A2 , which underwent nuclear export in response to activation of P61073 . Interestingly , the P61073 -mediated nuclear export of hnRNP A2 was blocked by RNAi of CyPA . Moreover , P61073 -evoked activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) was attenuated by CyPA RNAi , by overexpression of a PPIase-deficient mutant of CyPA ( CyPA-R55A ) , and by pretreatment of the immunosuppressive drugs , cyclosporine A and sanglifehrin A . Finally , P48061 -induced chemotaxis of HEK293 cells stably expressing P61073 or Jurkat T cells was inhibited by CyPA RNAi or DB00091 treatment .
