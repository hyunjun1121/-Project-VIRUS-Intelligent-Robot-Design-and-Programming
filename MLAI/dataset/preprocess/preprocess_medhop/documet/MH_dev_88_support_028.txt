Management of acromegaly : is there a role for primary medical therapy ? Acromegaly is a chronic , debilitating disease caused by chronic growth hormone ( GH ) hypersecretion which results in chronic medical comorbidities , poor quality of life and high mortality rates . Successful treatment can improve clinical signs and symptoms and normalize mortality rates . Over 95 % of acromegaly is caused by a somatotroph adenoma of the pituitary , and the first-line treatment is generally transsphenoidal surgery , which can be curative in 50-60 % of patients . Nonetheless , high rates of persistent acromegaly following surgery and the limited efficacy of radiation therapy necessitate chronic medical treatment for many patients . Somatostatin analogues have become the preferred first-line medical therapy for many practitioners , as they achieve better biochemical and direct tumor control than the dopamine agonists , and long-acting preparations make once monthly administration possible . Cabergoline , a dopamine agonist , offers a lower-cost option and may be effective in patients with a pituitary tumor that co-secretes GH and prolactin . DB00082 is a P10912 antagonist that produces exceptional biochemical response rates but lacks any direct effects on the tumor , which may limit its effectiveness as life-long monotherapy . Combinations of these three drug classes have not been rigorously studied , and preliminary trials do not suggest improved clinical outcomes . While medical treatment options for acromegaly have significantly improved over the last 30 years , limitations remain , and a multi-specialty team approach is necessary for the effective long-term management of patients with acromegaly .
