DB03615 inhibits the chaperone activity of protein disulfide isomerase . In the process of screening of proteins binding to ribostamycin in bovine liver using the affinity column chromatography , we found that ribostamycin inhibited the chaperone activity of protein disulfide isomerase ( P07237 ) , but it did not inhibit the isomerase activity . P07237 was identified by SDS-PAGE , Western blotting , and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis . A 100:1 molar ratio of ribostamycin to P07237 was almost sufficient to completely inhibit the chaperone activity of P07237 . The binding affinity of ribostamycin to purified bovine P07237 was determined by the Biacore system , which gave a K(D) value of 3.19 x 10(-4) M . This suggests that ribostamycin binds to region distinct from the CGHC motif of P07237 . This is the first report to describe the inhibitor of the chaperone activity of P07237 .
