Clinically relevant advances in rheumatoid arthritis therapy . Owing to the success of biologics in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , several novel drugs have been introduced in the therapeutic armamentarium , although not all of them have been approved in all countries worldwide . Among the drugs are tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) inhibitors such as certolizumab pegol and DB06674 ( the latter of which was the first P01375 blocker shown to be effective in patients who had been unsuccessfully treated with other P01375 blockers and which can be applied only once a month ) , and the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab , which not only opens up a completely new field of anti-inflammatory modulation of RA pathophysiology , but also highlights the challenge of novel potential side effects . Moreover , aside from clinical studies showing efficacy in the inhibition of osteoclast activation by the anti- O14788 ( receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand ) antibody denosumab , an improved form of steroid application known as slow-release ' tempus tablet ' for treatment of RA and several developments in the small-molecule area have been addressed by clinical trials .
