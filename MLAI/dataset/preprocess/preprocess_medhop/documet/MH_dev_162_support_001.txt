Ï‰-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid attenuates P25189 +-induced neurodegeneration in fully differentiated human SH-SY5Y and primary mesencephalic cells . DB00159 ( EPA ) , a neuroactive omega-3 fatty acid , has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in experimental models of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , but the cellular mechanisms of protection are unknown . Here , we studied the effects of EPA in fully differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells and primary mesencephalic neurons treated with P25189 (+) . In both in-vitro models of PD , EPA attenuated an P25189 (+) -induced reduction in cell viability . EPA also prevented the presence of electron-dense cytoplasmic inclusions in SH-SY5Y cells . Then , possible mechanisms of the neuroprotection were studied . In primary neurons , EPA attenuated an P25189 (+) -induced increase in Tyrosine-related kinase B ( TrkB ) receptors . In SH-SY5Y cells , EPA down-regulated reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide . This antioxidant effect of EPA may have been mediated by its inhibition of neuronal NADPH oxidase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) , as P25189 (+) increased the expression of these enzymes . Furthermore , EPA prevented an increase in cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( P47712 ) , an enzyme linked with P35354 in the potentially pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid cascade . Lastly , EPA attenuated an increase in the bax:bcl-2 ratio , and cytochrome c release . However , EPA did not prevent mitochondrial enlargement or a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential . This study demonstrated cellular mechanisms by which EPA provided neuroprotective effects in experimental PD .
