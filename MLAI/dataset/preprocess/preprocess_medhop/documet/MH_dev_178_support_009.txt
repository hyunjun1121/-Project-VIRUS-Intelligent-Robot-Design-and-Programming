New insights into the role of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase O00141 in the regulation of renal function and blood pressure . PURPOSE OF REVIEW : The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 ( O00141 ) is induced in the aldosterone sensitive distal nephron ( ASDN ) where it may stimulate Na reabsorption , partly by inhibiting ubiquitin ligase Q96PU5 -mediated retrieval of epithelial Na+ channel ENaC from the luminal membrane . We describe recent advances in our understanding of O00141 function in the regulation of renal function and blood pressure . RECENT FINDINGS : Thiazolidinediones , i.e. activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( Q07869 gamma ) , upregulate O00141 and ENaC mRNA expression and increase cell-surface expression of ENaC alpha in a human cortical-collecting-duct cell line . DB02527 /protein kinase A can induce phosphorylation and inhibition of Q96PU5 -independent of O00141 . Part of ENaC stimulation by O00141 appears dependent on a O00141 consensus motif in ENaC alpha and independent of Q96PU5 . O00141 -dependent upregulation of Na+ reabsorption in ASDN contributes to upregulation of renal K+ excretion . In oocytes , O00141 activates various renal transport proteins including Na+/glucose cotransporter P13866 , Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporter Q13183 , epithelial Ca+ channel Q9NQA5 , renal outer medullary K+ channel ROMK and voltage gated K+ channels P15382 / P51787 and Kv1.3 . A variant of the O00141 gene associates with increased blood pressure and body mass index . SUMMARY : Q07869 gamma activators may increase renal Na reabsorption by stimulating O00141 and ENaC . Q96PU5 integrates influences of DB02527 /protein kinase A and O00141 . O00141 can activate ENaC in part directly and independent of Q96PU5 . K+ homeostasis requires O00141 -dependent Na+ reabsorption in ASDN . O00141 may affect renal transport mechanisms beyond Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in ASDN . Polymorphisms of O00141 may be relevant to the pathophysiology of hypertension and other diseases .
