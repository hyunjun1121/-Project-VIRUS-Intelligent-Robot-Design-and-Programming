P10275 stimulates bone sialoprotein ( BSP ) gene transcription via DB02527 response element and activator protein 1/glucocorticoid response elements . Bone sialoprotein ( BSP ) is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation . Androgens are steroid hormones that are essential for skeletal development . The androgen receptor ( AR ) is a transcription factor and a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation . To determine the molecular mechanism involved in the stimulation of bone formation , we have analyzed the effects of androgens and AR effects on BSP gene transcription . AR protein levels were increased after AR overexpression in ROS17/2.8 cells . BSP mRNA levels were increased by AR overexpression . However , the endogenous and overexpressed BSP mRNA levels were not changed by DB02901 ( 10(-8) M , 24 h ) . Whereas luciferase ( LUC ) activities in all constructs , including a short construct ( nts -116 to +60 ) , were increased by AR overexpression , the basal and LUC activities enhanced by AR overexpression were not induced by DB02901 ( 10(-8)M , 24 h ) . The effect of AR overexpression was abrogated by 2 bp mutations in either the DB02527 response element ( CRE ) or activator protein 1 ( P05412 ) /glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) . Gel shift analyses showed that AR overexpression increased binding to the CRE and P05412 /GRE elements . Notably , the CRE-protein complexes were supershifted by phospho-CREB antibody , and CREB , c-Fos , c-Jun , and AR antibodies disrupted the complexes formation . The P05412 /GRE-protein complexes were supershifted by c-Fos antibody and c-Jun , and AR antibodies disrupted the complexes formation . These studies demonstrate that AR stimulates BSP gene transcription by targeting the CRE and P05412 /GRE elements in the promoter of the rat BSP gene .
