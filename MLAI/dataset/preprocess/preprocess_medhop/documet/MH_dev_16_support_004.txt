P01308 and adiponectin inhibit the TNFalpha-induced DB01686 accumulation in human endothelial cells : the role of DDAH . OBJECTIVE : P01308 and adiponectin exert important effects on the vasculature . We wanted to explore whether the P29474 inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) contribute to their effects . METHODS : Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) were incubated with growth medium in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , D-glucose , insulin or adiponectin . Further , cells exposed to TNFalpha for 24h were co-stimulated with insulin or adiponectin for additional 24h . Concentrations of DB01686 in conditioned media and activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ( DDAH ) in cell lysates were determined . RESULTS : The dose-dependent TNFalpha-induced DB01686 accumulation was significantly inhibited when co-stimulated with insulin or adiponectin in both cell lines ( p < 0.01 for all ) , accompanied by significant increases in DDAH activity in all conditions . P01308 alone resulted in a significant , but inversely dose-dependent accumulation of DB01686 as compared to control cells in both cell lines , accompanied by increased DDAH activity . Q15848 alone tended , dose-dependently to decrease DB01686 , but without an increase of DDAH activity . CONCLUSION : The results indicate that DB01686 accumulation in human cultured endothelial cells is influenced by both insulin and adiponectin , and both mediators counteract the TNFalpha-induced accumulation of DB01686 through the DDAH pathway .
