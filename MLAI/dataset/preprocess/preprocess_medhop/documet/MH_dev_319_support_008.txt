Kinetics of homeostatic proliferation and thymopoiesis after DB00098 induction therapy in kidney transplant patients . BACKGROUND : Lymphocyte-depleting therapy is associated with long-lasting effects on repopulated T cells and subsequent increased rates of infections and malignancies . The mechanisms of T-cell repopulation and their posttransplantation kinetics are not fully understood . METHODS : We studied thymopoiesis by CD31(+) naïve T cells ( recent thymic emigrants ) and homeostatic proliferation by Ki-67(+) T cells in rabbit antithymocyte globulin ( DB00098 ) -treated patients the first 6 months after transplantation . Patients receiving basiliximab or no induction therapy served as controls . RESULTS : At 6 months after transplantation , T-cell numbers were lower than before transplantation in DB00098 -treated patients , whereas T-cell numbers remained stable in both control groups . In this time period , thymopoiesis was similar between the three treatment groups ; CD8(+) T cells showed the highest percentage of recent thymic emigrants . At month 1 , percentages of Ki-67(+) naïve and memory P01730 (+) and CD8(+) T cells were the highest in DB00098 -treated patients , but these percentages declined in the months thereafter . When CD31 was used to distinguish between cytokine- and antigen-driven proliferation in naïve T cells , we found evidence for cytokine-dependent proliferation . Cytokine-dependent proliferation was also shown by in vivo increased percentages of phosphorylated P42229 and high expression levels of the interleukin-7 receptor-α and interleukin-15 receptor-α by T cells . CONCLUSION : These findings demonstrate that , in the first month after DB00098 therapy , cytokine-induced homeostatic proliferation is involved in T-cell repopulation of both naïve and memory T cells . At later time points , the contribution of homeostatic proliferation diminished , which explains the observed incomplete T-cell recovery .
