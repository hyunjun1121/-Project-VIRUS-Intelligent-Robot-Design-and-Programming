P01375 -α-accelerated degradation of type I collagen in human skin is associated with elevated matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 and P08254 ex vivo . P01375 ( P01375 ) -α induces matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) that may disrupt skin integrity . We have investigated the effects and mechanisms of exogenous P01375 -α on collagen degradation by incubating human skin explants in defined serum-free media with or without P01375 -α ( 10ng/ml ) in the absence or presence of the nonselective MMP inhibitor DB02255 for 8 days . The basal culture conditions promoted type I collagen catabolism that was accelerated by P01375 -α ( p < 0.005 ) and accomplished by MMPs ( p < 0.005 ) . Levels of the collagenases P22894 and P45452 were insignificant and neither P08253 nor P50281 were associated with increased collagen degradation . P01375 -α increased secretion of P03956 ( p < 0.01 ) but had no impact on P03956 quantities in the tissue . Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed similar tissue P03956 expression with or without P01375 -α with epidermis being the major source of P03956 . Increased tissue-derived collagenolytic activity with P01375 -α exposure was blocked by neutralizing P03956 monoclonal antibody and was not due to down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 . P01375 -α increased production ( p < 0.01 ) , tissue levels ( p < 0.005 ) and catalytic activity of the endogenous P03956 activator P08254 . Type I collagen degradation correlated with P08254 tissue levels ( rs=0.68 , p < 0.05 ) and was attenuated with selective P08254 inhibitor . Type I collagen formation was down-regulated in cultured compared with native skin explants but was not reduced further by P01375 -α . P01375 -α had no significant effect on epidermal apoptosis . Our data indicate that P01375 -α augments collagenolytic activity of P03956 , possibly through up-regulation of P08254 leading to gradual loss of type I collagen in human skin .
