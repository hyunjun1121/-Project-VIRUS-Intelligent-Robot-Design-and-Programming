P25116 antagonists : current state of evidence . DB09030 ( P35240 530348 ) and atopaxar ( E5555 ) are oral protease-activated receptor-1 ( P25116 ) antagonists with high bioavailability . They inhibits thrombin induced platelet aggregation by competitively inhibiting P25116 . We systematically evaluated the evidence for the efficacy and safety of all P25116 antagonists as well as for the individual drugs vorapaxar and atopaxar in different databases-PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus , and Cochrane register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL).We selected randomized controlled trials of P25116 antagonists that reported on cardiovascular mortality as a clinical outcome . The random-effects Mantel-Haenszel model was used to evaluate the effect of P25116 antagonists on cardiovascular mortality . Seven trials were selected ( N = 42,355 ) for analysis . P25116 antagonists as a class , as well as individually , were associated with a non-significant numerically lower risk of cardiovascular mortality than that seen with agents used in the control group ; RR , 0.93 ; 95 % CI , 0.83-1.04 ; P = 0.20 ) . No heterogeneity was noted . However , P25116 antagonists also appeared to increase the risk of bleeding significantly . P25116 antagonists appear to be associated with some reduction in the risk of cardiovascular mortality ; however the significantly higher bleeding risk noted with P25116 antagonists appear to mandate a very careful selection of patients that may benefit without a substantially increased risk of bleeds .
