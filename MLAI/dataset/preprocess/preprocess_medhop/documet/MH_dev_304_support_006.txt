Cloning of a novel phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase : characterization of the human Q96Q15 RNA surveillance protein . We have cloned and characterized a new member of the phosphatidylinositol kinase ( PIK ) -related kinase family . This gene , which we term human Q96Q15 ( Q96Q15 ) , is orthologous to Caenorhabditis elegans Q96Q15 , a protein that functions in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( Q53H76 ). cDNA sequencing revealed that Q96Q15 encodes a protein of 3031 amino acids containing a conserved kinase domain , a C-terminal domain unique to the PIK-related kinases and an P62942 -rapamycin binding-like domain similar to that found in the PIK-related kinase P42345 . Immunopurified FLAG-tagged Q96Q15 exhibits protein kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the generic PIK-related kinase substrate PHAS-1. Q96Q15 kinase activity is inhibited by high nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin ( IC(50) = 105 nm ) but is not inhibited by a P62942 -rapamycin complex . Mutation of conserved residues within the kinase domain of Q96Q15 abolishes both autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation , demonstrating that Q96Q15 exhibits intrinsic protein kinase activity . Q96Q15 phosphorylates purified Q92900 protein , a phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in Q53H76 , at sites that are also phosphorylated in whole cells . Based on these data , we conclude that Q96Q15 is the human orthologue to C. elegans Q96Q15 . Our data indicate that Q96Q15 may function in Q53H76 by directly phosphorylating Q92900 protein at physiologically relevant sites .
