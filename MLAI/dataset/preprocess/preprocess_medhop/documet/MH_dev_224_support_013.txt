Development of drugs to target interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells and treatment algorithms for inflammatory bowel diseases . Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) has led to new therapeutic strategies . One of these is to target the molecules that regulate interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells at sites of inflammation ( mainly leukocyte integrins and endothelial cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily ) . These molecules have been validated as therapeutic targets for Q9UKU7 ; several have shown efficacy , and 2 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Q9UKU7 . DB00108 , the first anti-integrin antibody tested for treatment of Q9UKU7 , blocks the α4 subunit . Although it is effective , its clinical use has been limited by its association with risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy . Other , allegedly more selective drugs that affect leukocyte recruitment in the gastrointestinal tract have been developed or are under investigation and could increase safety . These include vedolizumab and Q99217 181 ( antibodies against α4β7 ) , etrolizumab ( anti-β7 ) , and PF-00547659 ( anti-mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 ) . Other agents have been developed to block α4 ( the small molecule AJM300 ) , P51686 ( the small molecule DB05005 -B ) , and P02778 ( the antibody eldelumab ) . We review the scientific rationale for inhibiting interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells to reduce intestinal inflammation and analyze the clinical studies that have been performed to test these new molecules , with particular attention to safety . We propose an evidence-based clinical positioning of this class of drugs .
