P00749 in endothelial cells during acute inflammation of the appendix . DB00013 and tissue-type plasminogen activators ( u-PA and t-PA ) were identified immunohistochemically in normal and inflamed human appendices by means of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies . In addition , extracts of the tissues were analyzed for u-PA and t-PA by ELISA . Twelve appendices ( five normal and seven with acute inflammation ) were analyzed . In the normal appendices , there was a strong staining of the endothelial cells for t-PA , whereas there was negative staining for u-PA . In contrast , the endothelial cells in the inflamed appendices showed u-PA immunoreactivity , and negative or very weak reactions for t-PA . In the inflamed appendix , there was also a labeling of u-PA in fibroblast-like cells and in interstitial areas . The specificity of the staining was supported by a variety of staining controls and also by analysis of tissue extracts with ELISA , showing that on the average the inflamed appendices contained more than twice as much mu-PA per mg of protein as the normal appendices and less than one third of the amount of t-PA .
