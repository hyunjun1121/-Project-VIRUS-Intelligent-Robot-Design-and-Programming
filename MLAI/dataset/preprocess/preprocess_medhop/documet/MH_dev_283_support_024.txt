Effects of DB01045 , a potent inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes and an inhibitor of Q9Y6L6 /3 transport , on the single dose pharmacokinetics of anacetrapib . Anacetrapib is a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) inhibitor in development for treatment of dyslipidemia . This open-label , fixed-sequence , 3-period study was intended to evaluate the potential of anacetrapib to be a victim of Q9Y6L6 /3 inhibition and strong CYP3A induction using acute and chronic dosing of rifampin , respectively , as a probe . In this study , 16 healthy subjects received 100 mg anacetrapib administered without rifampin ( Day 1 , Period 1 ) , with single-dose ( SD ) 600 mg rifampin ( Day 1 , Period 2 ) , and with multiple-dose ( MD ) 600 mg rifampin for 20 days ( Day 14 , Period 3 ) . Log-transformed anacetrapib AUC0-∞ and Cmax were analyzed by a linear mixed effects model . The GMRs and 90 % CIs for anacetrapib AUC0-∞ and Cmax were 1.25 ( 1.04 , 1.51 ) and 1.43 ( 1.13 , 1.82 ) for SD rifampin ( Period 2/Period 1 ) and 0.35 ( 0.29 , 0.42 ) and 0.26 ( 0.21 , 0.32 ) for MD rifampin ( Period 3/Period 1 ) , respectively . Anacetrapib was generally well tolerated in both the absence/presence of SD and MD rifampin . In conclusion , treatment with SD rifampin , which inhibits the Q9Y6L6 /3 transporter system , did not substantially influence the SD pharmacokinetics of anacetrapib , while chronic ( 20 days ) administration of rifampin , which strongly induces CYP3A isozymes , reduced mean systemic exposure to SD anacetrapib by 65 % .
