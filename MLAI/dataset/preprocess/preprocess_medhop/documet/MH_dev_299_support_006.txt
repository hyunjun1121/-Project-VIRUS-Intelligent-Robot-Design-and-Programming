Elevated TGF-β1 levels might protect HCV/ HIV-coinfected patients from liver fibrosis . BACKGROUND : HIV accelerates hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -induced liver fibrosis by mechanisms not well understood . As HIV dysregulates transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1 ) and T regulatory ( Treg ) cells , both of which are involved in hepatic fibrogenesis , herein we describe their influence on liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic hepatitis C with and without HIV coinfection . METHODS : Eighty-eight subjects ( 42 HIV/HCV co-infected patients , 20 HCV-monoinfected patients , and 26 healthy controls ) were examined . Treg cells ( P01730 +Foxp3+ ) were measured in peripheral blood using flow cytometry . An enzyme immunoassay was used to measure TGF-β1 in plasma . Liver fibrosis staging was estimated using elastometry and advanced liver fibrosis was considered for ≥ 9·5 kPa ( P13726 -F4 Metavir estimates ) . RESULTS : Treg cells were increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients ( P = 0·004 ) , whereas TGF-β1 levels were similar in both groups of patients . While Treg cells levels were similar in both null-mild and advanced liver fibrosis patients , a high level of TGF-β1 was found in patients with low levels of liver fibrosis compared with those with advanced liver fibrosis [ 14·9 ng mL(-1) ( 5·6-37·9 ) vs. 5·5 ng mL(-1) ( 1·9-7·9 ) respectively P = 0·007 ] . In a multivariate logistic regression model , elevated TGF-β1 levels were significantly associated with not having advanced liver fibrosis [ OR : 0·13 ( 95 % CI : 0·02-0·71 ) , P = 0·019 ] . CONCLUSIONS : While Treg cells do not influence liver fibrosis staging , elevated TGF-β1 , probably through its anti-inflammatory effects , might protect HCV/HIV-coinfected patients from liver fibrosis .
