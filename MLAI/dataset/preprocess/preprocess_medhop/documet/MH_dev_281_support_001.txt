Synergistic effect of interleukin 1 alpha on nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae-induced up-regulation of human beta-defensin 2 in middle ear epithelial cells . BACKGROUND : We recently showed that beta-defensins have antimicrobial activity against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) and that interleukin 1 alpha ( P01583 ) up-regulates the transcription of beta-defensin 2 ( DEFB4 according to new nomenclature of the Human Genome Organization ) in human middle ear epithelial cells via a Src-dependent Raf- Q02750 /2- P29323 signaling pathway . Based on these observations , we investigated if human middle ear epithelial cells could release P01583 upon exposure to a lysate of NTHi and if this cytokine could have a synergistic effect on beta-defensin 2 up-regulation by the bacterial components . METHODS : The studies described herein were carried out using epithelial cell lines as well as a murine model of acute otitis media ( OM ) . Human cytokine macroarray analysis was performed to detect the released cytokines in response to NTHi exposure . Real time quantitative PCR was done to compare the induction of P01583 or beta-defensin 2 mRNAs and to identify the signaling pathways involved . Direct activation of the beta-defensin 2 promoter was monitored using a beta-defensin 2 promoter-Luciferase construct . An P01583 blocking antibody was used to demonstrate the direct involvement of this cytokine on DEFB4 induction . RESULTS : Middle ear epithelial cells released P01583 when stimulated by NTHi components and this cytokine acted in an autocrine/paracrine synergistic manner with NTHi to up-regulate beta-defensin 2 . This synergistic effect of P01583 on NTHi-induced beta-defensin 2 up-regulation appeared to be mediated by the p38 Q96HU1 kinase pathway . CONCLUSION : We demonstrate that P01583 is secreted by middle ear epithelial cells upon exposure to NTHi components and that it can synergistically act with certain of these molecules to up-regulate beta-defensin 2 via the p38 Q96HU1 kinase pathway .
