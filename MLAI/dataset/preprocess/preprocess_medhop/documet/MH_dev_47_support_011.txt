P43119 -induced P40763 phosphorylation in human erythroleukemia cells is mediated via Galpha(s) and Galpha(16) hybrid signaling . Human prostacyclin receptor ( hIP ) stimulates P40763 via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in human erythroleukemia ( HEL ) cells . Since hIP can utilize G(s) and G(q) proteins for signal transduction and that both G proteins can induce P40763 phosphorylation and activation via complex signaling networks , we sought to determine if one of them is predominant in mediating the hIP signal . Stimulation of P40763 DB00135 (705) and DB00133 (727) phosphorylations by the IP-specific agonist , cicaprost , was sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase A , phospholipase Cbeta , protein kinase C , calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and O60674 /3 . Unlike Galpha(16)-mediated regulation of P40763 in the same cells , cicaprost-induced P40763 DB00135 (705) phosphorylation was resistant to inhibition of Src and MEK while P40763 DB00133 (727) phosphorylation distinctly required phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase . This unique inhibitor-sensitivity pattern of P40763 phosphorylation was reproduced in HEL cells by stimulating the G(16)-coupled C5a receptor in the presence of dibutyryl- DB02527 , suggesting that the change in inhibitor-sensitivity was due to activation of the G(s) pathway . This postulation was confirmed by expressing constitutively active Galpha(16)QL and Galpha(s)QL in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the inhibitor-sensitivity of Galpha(16)QL-induced P40763 phosphorylations could be converted by the mere presence of Galpha(s)QL to resemble that obtained with cicaprost in HEL cells . In addition , the restoration of the Galpha(16)-mediated inhibitor-sensitivity upon cicaprost induction in Galpha(s)-knocked down HEL cells again verified the pivotal role of G(s) signal . Taken together , our observations illustrate that co-stimulation of G(s) and G(q) can result in the fine-tuning of P40763 activation status , and this may provide the basis for cell type-specific responses following activation of hIP .
