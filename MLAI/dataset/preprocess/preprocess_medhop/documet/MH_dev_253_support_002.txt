Immunomodulatory drugs inhibit expression of cyclooxygenase-2 from P01375 , IL-1beta , and LPS-stimulated human PBMC in a partially P22301 -dependent manner . Immunomodulatory drugs ( IMiDs ) are potent inhibitors of P01375 and IL-1beta and elevators of P22301 production in LPS-stimulated human PBMC . They are currently in clinical trials for various diseases , including multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic syndrome , and melanoma . In the present study , we have investigated the effects of thalidomide , DB00480 and CC-4047 on the expression of P35354 by stimulated PBMC . Our results show that thalidomide and IMiDs inhibited the expression of P35354 but not the P23219 protein in LPS- P01375 and IL-1beta stimulated PBMC and shortened the half-life of P35354 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner . They also inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 from LPS-stimulated PBMC . While anti- P01375 or IL-1beta neutralizing antibodies had no effect on P35354 expression , anti- P22301 neutralizing antibody elevated the expression of P35354 mRNA , and protein from treated PBMC . These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects of IMiDs may be due in part to elevation of P22301 production and its subsequent inhibition of P35354 expression .
