DB00082 : a new treatment modality for acromegaly . Acromegaly , a multisystemic disease resulting from excessive growth hormone ( GH ) and insulin-like growth factor-I ( P05019 ) levels in adults , is associated with a two-to-threefold increase in mortality . The available treatment options ( surgery , radiotherapy and medical treatment with somatostatin analogues or dopamine agonists ) fail to achieve the currently accepted goals of therapy in a substantial number of patients . DB00082 , a newly developed P10912 antagonist , represents a novel treatment modality for this disease . It binds with the P10912 and induces internalization , but blocks receptor signaling events , thereby reducing P05019 production . The two main published studies suggest that it is the most potent medical therapy with greater specificity , without being dependent on the tumour characteristics . However , apart from its high cost and the dilemmas raised concerning the appropriateness of using serum P05019 concentrations as a marker of disease activity , it may also occasionally be associated with elevations in liver enzyme levels . Further studies are required to confirm its high success rates as well as to investigate the possibility of inducing an increase in the pituitary tumour size . Currently , pegvisomant is a second line treatment for acromegaly with an adjuvant role and possibly of greater value in cases of resistance to other therapeutic options .
