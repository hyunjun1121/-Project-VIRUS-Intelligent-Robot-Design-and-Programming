DB00501 in elective Caesarean section . Effect on gastric acidity . Aspiration pneumonitis , Mendelson 's syndrome , continues to be an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in obstetric anaesthesia , despite widespread adoption of the practice of routine administration of alkalis . P25021 blocking drugs have been shown to reduce gastric secretion in non-obstetric patients . DB00501 was given intravenously to fasting patients before elective Caesarean section . In all 10 patients who received cimetidine 200 mg intravenously at 60 -- 80 minutes before anaesthesia , the pH of gastric contents at the time of induction was above 2.5 . When the interval between administration of the drug and induction of anaesthesia was only 30 -- 40 minutes ( six patients ) or was over 90 minutes ( 20 patients ) then the pH was raised to above this value in only two-thirds of patients . By contrast eight of 10 untreated patients were found to have a gastric pH of less than 2.5 . No adverse effects of cimetidine were seen in mothers or infants .
