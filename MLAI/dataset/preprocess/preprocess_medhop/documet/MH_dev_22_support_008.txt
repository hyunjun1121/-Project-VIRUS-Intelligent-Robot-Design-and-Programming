Molecular characterization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-related non-small cell lung cancer through aberrant methylation and alterations of P00533 signaling . BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular influence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ( P48444 ) on the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The methylation profiles of 12 genes , and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and P01116 mutations were determined for samples from 229 NSCLC patients . In addition , protein expression of P00533 and P04626 in 116 NSCLCs was analyzed based on the presence or absence of P48444 . RESULTS : IL-12Rbeta2 and Wif-1 methylation and P04626 overexpression were more frequent events in the P48444 group . Eighty nonmalignant lung tissues had no correlation with any molecular changes between the P48444 and the non- P48444 group . P00533 mutation was significantly higher in the non- P48444 group , while P00533 expression was inversely correlated with % FEV1.0 . In the P48444 group , unmethylated P09486 and Q96HF1 genes or a negative CpG island methylator phenotype ( CIMP ) was a negative prognostic factor , while methylation of p16(INK4A) and WNT antagonist genes was a negative prognostic factor in the non- P48444 group . CONCLUSIONS : Novel characteristics of P48444 -related NSCLC were identified by examination of methylation profiles and alterations of P00533 signaling . In consideration of the high sensitivity to smoking in patients with P48444 , NSCLC with P48444 might be a distinct population of smoke-related NSCLC , the genetic profile of which is quite different from non- P48444 NSCLC .
