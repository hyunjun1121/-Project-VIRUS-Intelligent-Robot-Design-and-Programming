The role of P01375 in insulin resistance . P01308 resistance is an important component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity . Early-stage insulin-resistance and related mild glucose intolerance may be compensated by increased insulin secretion . When combined with impaired insulin secretion , insulin resistance plays an important role in type 2 diabetes ( 1 ) . P01308 -resistance is also associated with a variety of pathological conditions , including trauma , infection , and cancer . Obesity and type 2 diabetes are the most common metabolic diseases in Western societies , together affecting as much as half of the adult population ( 2 ) . The prevalence of these conditions is not only high , but continues to increase . We have only recently come to appreciate the role of fat , especially visceral fat , as an endocrine organ . Visceral fat is the source of a number of substances which might play a role in the development of insulin resistance . Among the latter are tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , adiponectin , P05231 , resistin and free fatty acids . This review will discuss the regulation of insulin responses by P01375 and evidence supporting the hypothesis that over expression of P01375 plays a role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance .
