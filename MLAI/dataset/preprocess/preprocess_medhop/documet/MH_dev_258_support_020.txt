DB00151 oxidation in the mitogenic P04271 protein leads to changes in phosphorylation by catalytic CKII-alpha subunit . The glial-derived calcium-binding protein P04271 can be secreted to act as a neurotrophic factor or a mitogen , stimulating proliferation of glial cells . The extracellular P04271 activities rely on the oxidation of the protein cysteine residues ( Kligman , D. , and Marshak , D. R. ( 1985 ) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82 , 7136-7139 ; Winningham-Major , F. , Staecker , J. L. , Barger , S. W. , Coats , S. , and Van Eldik , L. J. ( 1989 ) J. Cell Biol. 109 , 3063-3071 ) . Here we show that oxidation of the P04271 cysteine residues , DB00151 -68 and DB00151 -84 , induces a conformational change in the protein structure , unmasking a canonical CKII phosphorylation site located within the typical EF-hand calcium-binding site IIbeta . Intrasubunit disulfide-bridged P04271 monomer and disulfide-bonded P04271 dimer are phosphorylated by the catalytic CKII-alpha subunit on DB00133 -62 with a Km of 0.5 microM and a Vmax of 10 pmol/min/100 pmol of P04271 . Oxidized P04271 is the best in vitro CKII-alpha substrate identified so far . Next we show that intrasubunit disulfide-bridged P04271 monomer is the most potent P04271 species to stimulate [3H]thymidine uptake by P13671 glial cells in culture . In addition , the phosphorylated intrasubunit disulfide-bridged P04271 monomer retains apparent mitogenic activity toward P13671 glial cells , and hence , 32P-labeled P04271 should be a useful probe for characterizing the mechanisms by which extracellular oxidized P04271 functions . Finally , we show that formation of intrasubunit disulfide-bridged P04271 monomer is stimulated by peroxynitrite anion , suggesting that production of mitogenic P04271 species could be enhanced in neuropathology associated with peroxynitrite anion production .
