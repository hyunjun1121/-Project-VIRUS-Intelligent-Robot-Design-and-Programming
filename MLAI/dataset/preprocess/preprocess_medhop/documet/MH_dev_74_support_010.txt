DB00688 impairs transduction of single-stranded adeno-associated viral vectors . Adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) liver-directed gene therapy seems a feasible treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I , an inherited liver disorder characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia . Transient immunosuppression coupled with vector administration seems needed to overcome host immune responses that prevent long-term expression in patients . The immunosuppressive mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ) , which inhibits de novo synthesis of purines , is a promising candidate . To investigate the potential use of DB00688 in patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome , we studied its effect on single-stranded AAV ( ssAAV ) -mediated correction of hyperbilirubinemia in the relevant preclinical model , the Gunn rat . Although DB00688 was well tolerated and effective it also impaired the efficacy of ssAAV . Subsequent in vitro studies showed that this effect is not specific for P22309 deficiency . In fact , clinical relevant concentrations of mycophenolic acid ( DB00603 ) , the active compound of DB00688 , also impair the transduction of P29320 -293T cells by ssAAV . Because this effect was reversed by guanosine addition , it seems that intracellular levels of this nucleotide become limited , suggesting that DB00603 impairs second-strand DNA synthesis . This is corroborated by observations that DB00603 did not impair transduction of 293T cells by a self-complementary AAV ( scAAV ) vector and that DB00688 did not reduce the scAAV efficacy in the Gunn rat . In conclusion , DB00688 impairs ssAAV-mediated liver-directed gene therapy , which is relevant for the use of this immunosuppressive agent with single-stranded vectors . Furthermore , because this effect is due to impaired second-strand synthesis , the use of DB00688 with scAAV seems warranted .
