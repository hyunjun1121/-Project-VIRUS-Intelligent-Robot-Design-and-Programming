tert-Butylcarbamate-containing histone deacetylase inhibitors : apoptosis induction , cytodifferentiation , and antiproliferative activities in cancer cells . Herein we report novel pyrrole- and benzene-based hydroxamates ( 8 , 10 ) and 2'-aminoanilides ( 9 , 11 ) bearing the tert-butylcarbamate group at the CAP moiety as histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors . Compounds 8 b and 10 c selectively inhibited Q9UBN7 at the nanomolar level , whereas the other hydroxamates effected an increase in acetyl-Î±-tubulin levels in human acute myeloid leukemia U937 cells . In the same cell line , compounds 8 b and 10 c elicited 18.4 and 21.4 % apoptosis , respectively ( DB02546 : 16.9 % ) , and the pyrrole anilide 9 c displayed the highest cytodifferentiating effect ( 90.9 % ) . In tests against a wide range of various cancer cell lines to determine its antiproliferative effects , compound 10 c exhibited growth inhibition from sub-micromolar ( neuroblastoma LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells , chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells ) to low-micromolar ( lung H1299 and A549 , colon HCT116 and HT29 cancer cells ) concentrations . In HT29 cells , 10 c increased histone H3 acetylation , and decreased the colony-forming potential of the cancer cells by up to 60 % .
