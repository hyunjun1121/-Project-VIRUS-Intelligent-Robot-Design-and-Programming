Human motor neuron progenitor transplantation leads to endogenous neuronal sparing in 3 models of motor neuron loss . Motor neuron loss is characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders and results in rapid loss of muscle control , paralysis , and eventual death in severe cases . In order to investigate the neurotrophic effects of a motor neuron lineage graft , we transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived motor neuron progenitors ( hMNPs ) and examined their histopathological effect in three animal models of motor neuron loss . Specifically , we transplanted hMNPs into rodent models of SMA ( Î”7SMN ) , P35858 ( P00441 G93A ) , and spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The transplanted cells survived and differentiated in all models . In addition , we have also found that hMNPs secrete physiologically active growth factors in vivo , including P01138 and P20783 , which significantly enhanced the number of spared endogenous neurons in all three animal models . The ability to maintain dying motor neurons by delivering motor neuron-specific neurotrophic support represents a powerful treatment strategy for diseases characterized by motor neuron loss .
