Regulation of pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) function and P22309 gene expression by posttranslational modification of O75469 protein . Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ( P78381 ) 1A1 is a critical enzyme responsible for detoxification and metabolism of endogenous and exogenous lipophilic compounds such as bilirubin . The present study shows how cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor roscovitine stimulated the expression of P22309 in HepG2 cells . O75469 ( O75469 ) -mediated transactivation of P22309 reporter gene was more prominently enhanced by roscovitine , compared with the basal- , constitutive androstane receptor ( CAR ) - , and aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated activities . We determined the regulatory mechanism of P22309 expression through O75469 's stimulation by roscovitine . Although phosphomimetic mutations at Thr290 and Thr408 retained the O75469 protein in cytoplasm and attenuated the induction of P22309 expression by both roscovitine and rifampicin , a mutation at Ser350 specifically reduced the activity of O75469 induced by roscovitine . Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the T290D but not T408D mutant protein remained in cytoplasm by forming a complex with heat shock protein 90 and cytoplasmic CAR retention protein , whereas treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 accumulated the T408D mutant protein in cytoplasm . Transfection with anti- P24941 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) but not anti- P06493 or Q00535 siRNA led to enhanced expression of P22309 . S350D yellow fluorescent protein- O75469 fusion protein could translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus similar to the wild-type protein but was detected as an acetylated protein , whose binding with retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and histone deacetylase was impaired . Cotransfection with coactivator steroid receptor coactivator ( P12931 ) 2 but not Q15788 partly recovered its O75469 activity . These results indicate that roscovitine stimulated the expression of P22309 by inhibiting P24941 , which phosphorylated O75469 at Ser350 to suppress binding with RXR and coactivator and maintain the acetylation of O75469 protein .
