DB00533 decreases renal injury in obese Zucker rats . The present study tested the hypothesis that altered vascular regulation of arachidonic acid enzymes in obese Zucker rats contributes to renal damage . Protein expression of CYP450 ( cytochrome P450 ) and P36551 ( cyclo-oxygenase ) enzymes in renal microvessels was studied in obese and lean Zucker rats at 20-21 weeks of age . Body weight and blood glucose averaged 649+/-13 g and 142+/-10 mg/dl in obese Zucker rats compared with 437+/-10 g and 111+/-5 mg/dl in age-matched lean Zucker rats . Renal microvascular CYP4A and P35354 protein levels were increased and CYP2C protein levels decreased in obese Zucker rats . TX ( thromboxane ) B2 excretion was 2-fold higher and PG ( prostaglandin ) E2 excretion significantly lower in obese Zucker rats . Additional studies investigated the ability of the P35354 inhibitor , rofecoxib , to slow the progression of renal injury in obese Zucker rats . DB00533 treatment decreased urinary PGF2alpha and 8-isoprostane levels in obese Zucker rats . Renal microvessel mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines was decreased in P35354 -inhibitor-treated obese Zucker rats . Urinary albumin excretion , an index of kidney damage , averaged 95+/-11 mg/day in vehicle-treated and 9+/-1 mg/day in rofecoxib-treated obese Zucker rats . Glomerulosclerosis , characterized by mesangial expansion , tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and extracellular matrix accumulation , was prominent in obese Zucker rats compared with a lack of damage in age-matched lean Zucker rats and rofecoxib-treated obese Zucker rats . These results suggest that altered vascular arachidonic acid enzymes contribute to the renal damage , and that P35354 inhibition decreases glomerular injury in obese Zucker rats .
