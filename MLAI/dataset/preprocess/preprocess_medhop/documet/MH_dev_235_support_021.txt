Mass spectrometric analysis of agonist effects on posttranslational modifications of the beta-2 adrenoceptor in mammalian cells . Posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) of the beta-2 adrenoceptor ( P07550 ) play a fundamental role in receptor regulation by agonists . We have examined the effects of several agonists on net levels of P07550 palmitoylation and phosphorylation using epitope tagging in stably transfected human embryonal kidney ( P29320 ) 293 cells , immunoaffinity purification , and mass spectrometry combined with the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) . Palmitoylation of Cys341 was confirmed and did not change detectably after 30 min exposure of cells to saturating concentrations of dopamine , epinephrine , or isoproterenol . However , all of these agonists produced a marked increase in net phosphorylation . Phosphorylation of the third cytoplasmic loop was increased to a similar degree by all three agonists , whereas differences between agonists were observed in net phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain ( isoproterenol approximately epinephrine >> dopamine ) . Interestingly , agonist-induced phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain was observed exclusively in a proximal portion ( between residues 339-369 ) . None of the agonists produced detectable phosphorylation in a distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail , which contains all sites of agonist-induced phosphorylation identified previously by in vitro reconstitution . These results provide insight to agonist-dependent regulation of the P07550 in intact cells , suggest the existence of significant differences in regulatory phosphorylation events occurring between in vitro and in vivo conditions , and outline a general analytical approach to investigate regulated PTM of receptors in mammalian cells .
