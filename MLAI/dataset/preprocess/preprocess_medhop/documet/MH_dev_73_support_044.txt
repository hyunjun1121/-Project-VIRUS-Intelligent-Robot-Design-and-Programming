Cannabinoid physiology and pharmacology : 30 years of progress . Delta9- DB00470 from Cannabis sativa is mimicked by cannabimimetic analogs such as CP55940 and WIN55212-2 , and antagonized by rimonabant and SR144528 , through G-protein-coupled receptors , P21554 in the brain , and CB2 in the immune system . Eicosanoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol are the " endocannabinoid " agonists for these receptors . P21554 receptors are abundant in basal ganglia , hippocampus and cerebellum , and their functional activity can be mapped during behaviors using cerebral metabolism as the neuroimaging tool . P21554 receptors couple to G(i/o) to inhibit DB02527 production , decrease Ca2+ conductance , increase K+ conductance , and increase mitogen-activated protein kinase activity . Functional activation of G-proteins can be imaged by [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography . Post-synaptically generated endocannabinoids form the basis of a retrograde signaling mechanism referred to as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition ( DSI ) or excitation ( Q9UL01 ) . Under circumstances of sufficient intracellular Ca2+ ( e.g. , burst activity in seizures ) , synthesis of endocannabinoids releases a diffusible retrograde messenger to stimulate presynaptic P21554 receptors . This results in suppression of gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) release , thereby relieving the post-synaptic inhibition . Tolerance develops as neurons adjust both receptor number and cellular signal transduction to the chronic administration of cannabinoid drugs . Future therapeutic drug design can progress based upon our current understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of P21554 , CB2 and related receptors . One very important role for P21554 antagonists will be in the treatment of craving in the disease of substance abuse .
