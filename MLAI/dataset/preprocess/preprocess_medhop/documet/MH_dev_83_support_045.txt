Selective P35354 inhibitors and the surgical patient . The identification of P35354 less than a decade ago has been followed by an unprecedented period of discovery and drug development ( Golden & Abramson , 1999 ) . Clinical studies thus far have established that the selective P35354 inhibitors , celecoxib ( DB00482 ) and rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) are effective in the treatment of OA and RA , as are conventional NSAIDs . However , they do not cause the same adverse effects on the GI mucosa nor do they increase bleeding time as do conventional NSAIDs . Therefore , their use is not contraindicated in pre or postsurgical patients . Further investigation is underway to fully elucidate the role of P35354 and to determine any additional benefits of selective P35354 inhibition .
