[ Blood cytokine levels as a clinical laboratory test ] . Cytokines have not been employed in clinical laboratory tests because of the many biological activities of individual cytokines and too complicated cytokine network . However , abnormal laboratory data and symptoms can be interpreted by blood cytokine levels . [ Cytokines attributable to abnormal data and symptoms ] For example , cytokines attributable to abnormal data and symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis are as follows : joint pain : TNFalpha , IL-1 , P05231 , and Q14116 ; general fatigue and appetite loss : TNFalpha and IL-1 ; leukocytosis : G- P04141 produced by IL-1-stimulated macrophages etc ; thrombocytosis : megakaryocyte potentiating activity of P05231 ; anemia : hepcidin up-regulated by P05231 , which inhibits iron absorption from the intestine , and IL-1 , which decreases the blood iron level and promotes ferritin synthesis . [ Differential diagnosis using blood cytokine levels ] Blood cytokine levels are useful and important in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory disorders such as neutrophilia , eosinophilia , and especially in distinguishing tumoral fever from infectious fever in malignant lymphomas . [ Disease/disorder-specific cytokines ] In recent years , disease- or disorder specific cytokines have been identified , making cytokines more important in clinical use . For example , Q14116 for adult-onset Still disease ; IFNgamma for hemophagocytic syndrome ; P05113 for allergic disorders ; thrombopoietin for immune thrombocytopenic purpura ; vascular endothelial growth factor for POEMS syndrome ; P12272 for malignancy associated hypercalcemia . [ Flow cytometric measurement of cytokines ] Recently , a flow cytometric method has been developed in addition to ELISA . With this method , 30 cytokine concentrations can be measured simultaneously within four hours with a wide range of detection limit and high cost performance . Cytokines will be included in laboratory tests with this method .
