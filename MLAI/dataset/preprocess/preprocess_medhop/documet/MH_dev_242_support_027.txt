Agonist-induced glycogenolysis in rabbit retinal slices and cultures . 1. The effects of different putative retinal transmitters and/or modulators on glycogenolysis in rabbit retinal slices and in retinal MÃ¼ller cell cultures were examined . 2 . Incubation of rabbit retinal slices or primary retinal cultures ( either 3-5 day-old or 25-30 day-old ) in a buffer solution containing [ 3H ] -glucose resulted in the accumulation of newly synthesized [ 3H ] -glycogen . 3 . DB00368 ( NA ) , isoprenaline , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( P01282 ) , 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) and 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminetetralin ( 8-OH-DPAT ) stimulated the hydrolysis of this newly formed 3H-polymer . The potency order of maximal stimulations was : P01282 greater than NA greater than isoprenaline greater than 5-HT greater than 8-OH-DPAT . 4 . The putative retinal transmitters , dopamine , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glycine and taurine and the muscarinic agonist carbachol ( CCh ) had no effect on [ 3H ] -glycogen content . 5 . The glycogenolytic effects of NA/isoprenaline and 5-HT/8-OH-DPAT appear to be mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1 receptors ( possibly P08908 ) , respectively while the P01282 -induced response involved another receptor subtype . 6 . Agonists which mediated [ 3H ] -glycogen hydrolysis also stimulated an increase in adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) formation . Both responses are blocked to a similar extent by the same antagonists and so are probably mediated via the same receptor subtypes . Moreover , dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( db cyclic AMP ) promoted tritiated glycogen breakdown in the three retinal preparations . 7 . Not all receptors linked to cyclic AMP production however promote glycogenolysis . Dopamine and apomorphine stimulated cyclic AMP formation via D1-receptors without influencing glycogenolysis . These receptors are exclusively associated with neurones .
