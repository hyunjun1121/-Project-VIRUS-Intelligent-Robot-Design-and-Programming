Natriuretic peptides induce weak P50552 phosphorylation at DB00133 239 in platelets . Cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophoshate ( cGMP ) is the common second messenger for the cardiovascular effects of nitric oxide ( NO ) and natriuretic peptides ( NP ; e.g. atrial NP [ P01160 ] ) , which activate soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases , respectively . The role of NO in regulating cGMP and platelet function is well documented , whereas there is little evidence supporting a role for NPs in regulating platelet reactivity . By studying platelet aggregation and secretion in response to a P25116 peptide , collagen and ADP , and phosphorylation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( P50552 ) at serine 239 , we evaluated the effects of NPs in the absence or presence of the non-selective cGMP and DB02527 phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) inhibitor , DB07954 ( DB07954 ) . Our results show that NPs , possibly through the clearance receptor ( natriuretic peptide receptor-C ) expressed on platelet membranes , increase P50552 phosphorylation but only following PDE inhibition , indicating a small , localised cGMP synthesis . As platelet aggregation and secretion measured under the same conditions were not affected , we conclude that the magnitude of PKG activation achieved by NPs in platelets per se is not sufficient to exert functional inhibition of platelet involvement in haemostasis .
