Potential side effects to P0C6A0 agonists : understanding their safety and tolerability . INTRODUCTION : P43220 ( GLP-1Rx ) agonists might elicit unwelcome side effects and concerns have recently been raised about their safety . AREAS COVERED : Available evidence about safety , tolerability and potential adverse events relative to GLP-1Rx agonists presently used . We searched the MEDLINE database using the terms : ' P43220 agonists ' , ' Incretin therapy side effects ' , ' exenatide ' , ' liraglutide ' , ' exenatide long-acting release ' , ' lixisenatide ' . Articles were selected on the basis of the study design and importance , in the light of authors ' clinical experience and personal judgment . The main safety concern about GLP-1Rx agonists use is the possible association with increased risk of pancreatitis and/or tumors . This concern stems mainly from limited observations in animal models not confirmed in similar studies . Furthermore , clinical studies reporting association between GLP-1Rx agonist use and pancreatitis/cancer are marred by several biases and both clinical trials and post-marketing analyses failed to demonstrate a significant association . EXPERT OPINION : As stated by both FDA and P15941 , the safety concerns emerged so far about GLP-1RX agonists should not affect present prescribing habits . Thus , although a strict data monitoring must be encouraged , they should not prevent access to the benefits of an innovative treatment , such as GLP-1Rx agonists use , to a large diabetic population still confronted with unmet needs .
