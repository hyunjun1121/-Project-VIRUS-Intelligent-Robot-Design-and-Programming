Effect of siRNAs targeting the P00533 T790M mutation in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line resistant to P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and combination with various agents . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , some mutations confer resistance to current available agents , especially the frequently occurring T790M mutation . In the current study , we have examined , in a NSCLC cell line H1975 containing both L858R and T790M mutations , the effect of T790M-specific-siRNAs versus other P00533 -specific-siRNAs . T790M-specific-siRNAs were able to inhibit T790M and P00533 mRNA , to reduce P00533 protein expression , as well as to reduce the cell growth and induce cell caspase activity in H1975 cells . However , this effect showed less potency compared to the other P00533 -specific-siRNAs . P00533 -specific-siRNAs strongly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in H358 , H1650 , H292 , HCC827 and also in H1975 cells , which showed weak response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or cetuximab . The addition of T790M-specific-siRNAs could rescue the sensitivity of T790M mutant H1975 cells to TKIs . The combination of T790M-specific-siRNAs and cetuximab also additively enhanced cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in H1975 cells . Among the anti- P00533 agents tested , the strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with T790M-specific-siRNAs . DB08916 also offered extra effect when combined with cetuximab in H1975 cells . In conclusion , knock-down of T790M transcript by siRNAs further decreases the cell growth of T790M mutant lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab . The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with T790M-specific-siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer containing the resistant T790M mutation .
