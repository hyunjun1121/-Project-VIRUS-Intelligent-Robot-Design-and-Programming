Biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis : 2008 and beyond . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic disease with a complex underlying pathology and varied presentation in patients . Several novel biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have become available for the treatment of RA . Agents in late-stage clinical trials include DB06674 and certolizumab , which are anti-tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha agents ; ocrelizumab , an anti- P11836 agent ; and tocilizumab , an inhibitor of interleukin-6 . As treatment options for RA expand , nursing care will play an increasingly important role in empowering patients through interventions such as patient education and adverse effect management .
