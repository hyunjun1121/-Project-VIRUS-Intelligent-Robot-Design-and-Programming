AM2389 , a high-affinity , in vivo potent P21554 -receptor-selective cannabinergic ligand as evidenced by drug discrimination in rats and hypothermia testing in mice . RATIONALE : The endocannabinoid signaling system ( ECS ) has been targeted for developing novel therapeutics since ECS dysfunction has been implicated in various pathologies . Current focus is on chemical modifications of the hexahydrocannabinol ( HHC ) nabilone ( DB00486 (®) ) . OBJECTIVE : To characterize the novel , high-affinity cannabinoid receptor 1 ( CB(1)R ) HHC-ligand AM2389 [ 9β-hydroxy-3-(1-hexyl-cyclobut-1-yl)-hexahydrocannabinol in two rodent pre-clinical assays . MATERIALS AND METHODS : CB(1)R mediation of AM2389-induced hypothermia in mice was evaluated with AM251 , a CB(1)R-selective antagonist/inverse agonist . Additionally , two groups of rats discriminated the full cannabinergic aminoalkylindole AM5983 ( 0.18 and 0.56 mg/kg ) from vehicle 20 min post-injection in a two-choice operant conditioning task motivated by 0.1 % saccharin/water . Generalization/substitution tests were conducted with AM2389 , AM5983 , and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ(9)-THC ) . RESULTS : Δ(9)-THC (30 mg/kg)-induced hypothermia exhibited a faster onset and shorter duration of action compared with AM2389 ( 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg ) . AM251 ( 3 and 10 mg/kg ) attenuated/blocked hypothermia induced by 0.3 mg/kg AM2389 . In drug discrimination , the order of potency was AM2389 > AM5983 > Δ(9)-THC with ED(50) values of 0.0025 , 0.0571 , and 0.2635 mg/kg , respectively , in the low-dose condition . The corresponding ED(50) values in the high-dose condition were 0.0069 , 0.1246 , and 0.8438 mg/kg , respectively . Onset of the effects of AM2389 was slow with a protracted time-course ; the functional , perceptual in vivo half-life was approximately 17 h . CONCLUSIONS : This potent cannabinergic HHC exhibited a slow onset of action with a protracted time-course . The AM2389 chemotype appears well suited for further drug development , and AM2389 currently is used to probe behavioral consequences of sustained ECS activation .
