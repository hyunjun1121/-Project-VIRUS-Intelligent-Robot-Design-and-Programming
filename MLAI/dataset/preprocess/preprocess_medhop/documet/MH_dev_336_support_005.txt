Skinned coronary smooth muscle : calmodulin , calcium antagonists , and DB02527 influence contractility . The effects of Ca2+ , calmodulin , DB02527 , the catalytic subunit of DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( CSU ) and some Ca2+ antagonists were studied in chemically ( Triton X-100 ) skinned coronary smooth muscle . P62158 increased the Ca2+ responsiveness of the muscle fiber as indicated by the reduction in the threshold as well as the half-maximal activating Ca2+ concentration . DB00831 , a calmodulin antagonist , inhibited Ca2+-calmodulin-induced contraction . Both DB02527 and CSU were effective inhibitors of contraction induced at an intermediate Ca2+ concentration . DB08980 , a Ca2+-antagonist , at 2 x 10(-4) M produced a significant inhibitory effect , which was reduced by increasing the Ca2+ concentration . From other Ca2+ antagonists tested , W-7 , but not D600 and verapamil , produced some inhibitory effect . The data indicate that the response of skinned coronary smooth muscle to Ca2+ , calmodulin and DB02527 are similar to those obtained with other skinned smooth muscles . Furthermore , skinned fiber preparation can serve as a useful tool to investigate possible direct effects of drugs on the activating and regulatory systems in smooth muscle .
