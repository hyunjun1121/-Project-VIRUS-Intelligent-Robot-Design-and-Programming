Behavioural and hypothalamic molecular effects of the anti-cancer agent cisplatin in the rat : A model of chemotherapy-related malaise ? Many cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience fatigue , disturbed circadian rhythms , anorexia and a variety of dyspeptic symptoms including nausea . There is no animal model for this ' chemotherapy-related malaise ' so we investigated the behavioural and molecular effects of a potent chemotherapeutic agent , cisplatin ( CP , 6 mg/kg , i.p. ) in rats . Dark-phase horizontal locomotor activity declined post-CP reaching a nadir on day 3 ( P < 0.001 ) , before recovering after 7 days . CP 's effect was most marked in the late part ( 05.00-07.00 ) of the dark-phase . Food intake reached a nadir ( P > 0.001 ) at 2 days , coincident with an increase in gastric contents ( cisplatin 9.04+/-0.8 vs. saline 2.32+/-0.3 g ; P < 0.001 ) . No changes occurred in hypothalamic mRNA expression for O00253 , P01303 , O43612 , P06850 , IL-1 , P05231 , TNFalpha , P45844 , P31645 , P62937 and P00492 mRNA but tryptophan hydroxylase ( P17752 ) mRNA was decreased ( 47 % , P < 0.05 ) at day 21 post-CP . This shows that despite marked behavioural effects of cisplatin , only a discrete change ( P17752 ) was found in hypothalamic mRNA expression and that occurred when the animals ' behaviour had recovered . Findings are discussed in relation to the neuropharmacology of chemotherapy-induced malaise .
