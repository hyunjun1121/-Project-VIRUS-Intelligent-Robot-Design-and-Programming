The establishment and characterization of cell lines stably expressing human P13010 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein . The Ku protein is a complex of two subunits , P12956 and P13010 , and it plays a role in multiple nuclear processes , e.g. , nonhomologous DNA-end-joining ( NHEJ ) , chromosome maintenance , and transcription regulation . On the other hand , several studies have reported a cytoplasmic or cell surface localization of Ku in various cell types . The mechanism underlying the regulation of all the diverse functions of Ku is still unclear , though the mechanism that regulates the nuclear localization of P12956 and P13010 appears to play , at least in part , a key role in regulating the physiological function of Ku . In this study , we generated cell lines expressing the human P13010 tagged with the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) color variants in P13010 -deficient cells , i.e. , xrs-6 derived from CHO- P04264 . Although P12956 , as well as P13010 , was undetectable in xrs-6 cells , it was seen in these transformants at a level similar to the level of CHO- P04264 . Furthermore , etoposide- and radiosensitive phenotype of xrs-6 cells were corrected by an introduction of the tagged P13010 . Moreover , the tagged P13010 suppressed apoptosis triggered by DNA damage . These results demonstrate that fusion to the GFP color variants does not interfere with the functions of the P13010 in the Ku-dependent DSB repair . Therefore , these transformants might be useful not only in the analysis of P13010 behavior , but also in an analysis of the dynamics of the NHEJ repair process .
