Euscaphic acid isolated from roots of Rosa rugosa inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory responses via O00206 -mediated NF-κB inactivation in RAW 264.7 macrophages . As an attempt to search for bioactive natural products exerting anti-inflammatory activity , we have evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of euscaphic acid ( 19α-hydroxyursane-type triterpenoids , EA ) isolated from roots of Rosa rugosa and its underlying molecular mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced RAW 264.7 macrophages . EA concentration-dependently reduced the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) , prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( P01375 -α ) , and interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 macgophages . Consistent with these data , expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) protein and P35228 , P35354 , P01375 -α , and IL-1β mRNA were inhibited by EA in a concentration-dependent manner . In addition , EA attenuated LPS-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB ) , which was accompanied by a parallel reduction of degradation and phosphorylation of inhibitory kappa Bα ( IκBα ) and consequently by decreased nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-κB . Pretreatment with EA significantly inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase β ( IKKβ ) , p38 , and JNK , whereas the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 was unaffected . Furthermore , EA interfered with the LPS-induced clustering of Q9Y4K3 ( Q9Y4K3 ) with interleukin receptor associated kinase 1 ( P51617 ) and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that EA inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory responses by interference with the clustering of Q9Y4K3 with P51617 and TAK1 , resulting in blocking the activation of IKK and MAPKs signal transduction to downregulate NF-κB activations .
