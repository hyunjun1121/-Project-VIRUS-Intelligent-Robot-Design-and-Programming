No differences in the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the thrombin receptor antagonist vorapaxar between healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects . BACKGROUND : DB09030 , a novel antiplatelet agent in advanced clinical development for the prevention and treatment of atherothrombotic disease , is a potent , orally bioavailable thrombin receptor antagonist selective for the protease-activated receptor 1 ( P25116 ) . METHODS : Since race/ethnicity may affect the safety , efficacy and dosage of drugs , this study was conducted to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics and safety of vorapaxar after single ( 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 mg ) or multiple ( 0.5 , 1 , or 2.5 mg once daily ) doses in healthy Japanese and matched ( gender , age , height , and weight ) Caucasian volunteers . RESULTS : DB09030 was well tolerated in both Japanese and Caucasian subjects . Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of vorapaxar in the two racial/ethnic groups were similar . In both racial groups , complete inhibition of platelet aggregation was achieved most rapidly with vorapaxar 40 mg and was consistently achieved and maintained with a 2.5 mg daily maintenance dose . CONCLUSION : There were no substantial differences in the safety , pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of vorapaxar between Japanese and Caucasian subjects .
