Phosphodiesterases Regulate BAY 41-2272-Induced P50552 Phosphorylation in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells . BAY 41-2272 ( BAY ) , a stimulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase , increases cyclic nucleotides and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . In this study , we elucidated mechanisms of action of BAY in its regulation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( P50552 ) with an emphasis on VSMC phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) . BAY alone increased phosphorylation of P50552 (Ser239) and P50552 (Ser157) , respective indicators of PKG and PKA signaling . DB07954 , a non-selective inhibitor of PDEs , had no effect on BAY-induced phosphorylation at P50552 (Ser239) but inhibited phosphorylation at P50552 (Ser157) . Selective inhibitors of PDE3 or DB05876 attenuated BAY-mediated increases at P50552 (Ser239) and P50552 (Ser157) , whereas O76074 inhibition potentiated BAY-mediated increases only at P50552 (Ser157) . In comparison , 8Br-cGMP increased phosphorylation at P50552 (Ser239) and P50552 (Ser157) which were not affected by selective PDE inhibitors . In the presence of 8Br- DB02527 , inhibition of either DB05876 or O76074 decreased P50552 (Ser239) phosphorylation and inhibition of PDE3 increased phosphorylation at P50552 (Ser239) , while inhibition of PDE3 or DB05876 increased and O76074 inhibition had no effect on P50552 (Ser157) phosphorylation . These findings demonstrate that BAY operates via DB02527 and cGMP along with regulation by PDEs to phosphorylate P50552 in VSMCs and that the mechanism of action of BAY in VSMCs is different from that of direct cyclic nucleotide analogs with respect to P50552 phosphorylation and the involvement of PDEs . Given a role for P50552 as a critical cytoskeletal protein , these findings provide evidence for BAY as a regulator of VSMC growth and a potential therapeutic agent against vasculoproliferative disorders .
