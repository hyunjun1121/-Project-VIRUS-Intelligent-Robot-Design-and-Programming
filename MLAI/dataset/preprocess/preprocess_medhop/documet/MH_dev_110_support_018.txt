[18F]MK-9470 PET measurement of cannabinoid P21554 receptor availability in chronic cannabis users . Δ(9) - DB00470 , the main psychoactive component of cannabis , exerts its central effects through activation of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid ( P21554 ) receptor . Pre-clinical studies have provided evidence that chronic cannabis exposure is linked to decreased P21554 receptor expression and this is thought to be a component underlying drug tolerance and dependence . In this study , we make first use of the selective high-affinity positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligand [ ( 18 ) F ] MK-9470 to obtain in vivo measurements of cerebral P21554 receptor availability in 10 chronic cannabis users ( age = 26.0 ± 4.1 years ) . Each patient underwent [ ( 18 ) F ] MK-9470 PET within the first week following the last cannabis consumption . A population of 10 age-matched healthy subjects ( age = 23.0 ± 2.9 years ) was used as control group . Parametric modified standardized uptake value images , reflecting P21554 receptor availability , were calculated . Statistical parametric mapping and volume-of-interest ( VOI ) analyses of P21554 receptor availability were performed . Compared with controls , cannabis users showed a global decrease in P21554 receptor availability ( -11.7 percent ) . VOI-based analysis demonstrated that the P21554 receptor decrease was significant in the temporal lobe ( -12.7 percent ) , anterior ( -12.6 percent ) and posterior cingulate cortex ( -13.5 percent ) and nucleus accumbens ( -11.2 percent ) . Voxel-based analysis confirmed this decrease and regional pattern in P21554 receptor availability in cannabis users . These findings revealed that chronic cannabis use may alter specific regional P21554 receptor expression through neuroadaptive changes in P21554 receptor availability , opening the way for the examination of specific P21554 -cannabis addiction interactions which may predict future cannabis-related treatment outcome .
