P01375 as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases , ischemia-reperfusion injury and trauma . P01375 -alpha ( P01375 ) is a central regulator of inflammation , and P01375 antagonists may be effective in treating inflammatory disorders in which P01375 plays an important pathogenetic role . Recombinant or modified proteins are an emerging class of therapeutic agents . To date , several recombinant or modified proteins which acts as P01375 antagonists have been disclosed . In particular , antibodies that bind to and neutralise P01375 have been sought as a means to inhibit P01375 activity . Inhibition of P01375 has proven to be an effective therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory disease including psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , and ankylosing spondylitis , inflammatory bowel disease . Additionally , the efficacy of preventing septic shock and AIDS has been questioned as a result of recent research . The currently available therapies include a soluble p75 P01375 receptor:Fc construct , etanercept , a chimeric monoclonal antibody , infliximab , and a fully human monoclonal antibody , adalimumab . DB08904 is a novel P01375 inhibitor which is an antigen-binding domain of a humanized P01375 antibody coupled to polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) to increase half-life , and thus is Fc-domain-free . In this review , we discuss briefly the present understanding of P01375 -mediated biology and the current therapies in clinical use , and focus on some of the new therapeutic approaches with small-molecule inhibitors . Moreover , we examine recent reports providing important insights into the understanding of efficacy of thalidomide and its analogs , as P01375 activity inhibitories , especially in therapies of several inflammatory diseases within the nervous system .
