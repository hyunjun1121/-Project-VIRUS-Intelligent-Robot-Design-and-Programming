1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine ( TFMPP ) in the ventral tegmental area reduces the effect of desipramine in the forced swimming test in rats : possible role of serotonin receptors . 1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine ( TFMPP ) , a serotonin1 ( 5-HT1 ) receptor agonist , injected i.p. in doses of 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg , did not modify the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test but significantly antagonized the effect of a 7 days treatment with 10 mg/kg per day desipramine ( DB01151 ) . A similar effect was found on infusing 1 and 5 micrograms/microliters TFMPP bilaterally into the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) . Infusion of 5 micrograms/microliters TFMPP into the nucleus accumbens or into the globus pallidus did not modify the effect of DB01151 . The effect of 5 micrograms TFMPP infused into the VTA was prevented by the i.p. administration of 5 mg/kg metergoline , a non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist . Infusion of 5 micrograms/microliters 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin , a specific P08908 receptor agonist , into the VTA did not modify the effect of DB01151 . Besides acting as a P28222 receptor agonist , TFMPP may also act on other 5-HT receptor types , but available evidence suggests that its former action is more important . It thus appears that 5-HT1 receptors in the VTA , presumably of the P28222 type , act by preventing the anti-immobility effect of DB01151 . The role of VTA dopamine and non-dopamine cells in the effect of TFMPP is discussed .
