Gender difference in the activity but not expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in human lung adenocarcinoma cells . The higher frequency of lung adenocarcinoma in women smokers than in men smokers suggests a role for gender-dependent factors in the etiology of lung cancer . We evaluated estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha and beta expression and activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and normal lung fibroblasts . Q8N1N2 -length ERalpha and ERbeta proteins were expressed in all cell lines with higher ERbeta than ERalpha . Although estradiol ( E(2) ) binding was similar , E(2) stimulated proliferation only in cells from females , and this response was inhibited by anti-estrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( DB04468 ) and DB00947 . In contrast , E(2) did not stimulate replication of lung adenocarcinoma cells from males and DB04468 or ICI did not block cell proliferation . Similarly , transcription of an estrogen response element-driven reporter gene was stimulated by E(2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females , but not males . P06401 ( PR ) expression was increased by E(2) in two out of five adenocarcinoma cell lines from females , but none from males . E(2) decreased P12830 protein expression in some of the cell lines from females , as it did in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , but not in the cell lines from males . Thus , ERalpha and ERbeta expression does not correlate with the effect of ER ligands on cellular activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . On the other hand , coactivator Q15648 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma cells from females versus males and higher in adenocarcinoma cells than in normal human bronchial epithelial cells . Q15648 and other ER coregulators may contribute to differences in estrogen responsiveness between lung adenocarcinoma cells in females and males .
