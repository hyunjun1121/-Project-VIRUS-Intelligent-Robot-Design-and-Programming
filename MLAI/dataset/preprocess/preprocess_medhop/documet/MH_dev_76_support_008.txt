[ DB01012 -- a new drug for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with uraemia , parathyroid cancer or primary hyperparathyroidism ] . DB01012 is a new drug with antiparathyroid effects that belongs to the class of calcimimetics . It increases the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) to calcium , thus inducing a decrease in plasma parathyroid ( PTH ) levels . In patients with uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism due to uremia , cinacalcet has been shown to decrease the levels of PTH even in those optimally treated with calcium and 1-ahydroxylated vitamin D . DB01012 decreases plasma calcium and plasma PTH levels in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or parathyroid cancer .
