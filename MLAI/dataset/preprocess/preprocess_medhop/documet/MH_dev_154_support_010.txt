DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its receptor ( Q03405 ) in gestational tissues ; Measurements and clinical implications . BACKGROUND : DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) are central molecules for uPA/ Q03405 /plasmin-dependent proteolysis , which is thought to play a significant role in the development of pregnancy , as well as its many complications . OBJECTIVE : To measure the levels of uPA and Q03405 in the placenta and myometrium , as well as in the foetal membranes and amniotic fluid . STUDY DESIGN : The study group consisted of 35 women with normal course of pregnancy , but with complications arising during delivery , which led to Caesarean section . Samples of placenta , myometrium , foetal membranes , amniotic fluid and blood were obtained at the time of operation . Tissue extracts were prepared . Measurements were made by the ELISA method . RESULTS : uPA and Q03405 concentration in gestational tissues , including amniotic fluid , is 100-200 times higher than in plasma . Among tissues , the highest uPA level was found in placenta ( 1.32 +/- 0.48 ng/mg of protein ) , and the highest Q03405 level in foetal membranes ( 3.33 +/- 1.20 ng/mg of protein ) . CONCLUSIONS : uPA and Q03405 are present in all gestational tissues , in some in relatively high concentrations . Our results support the modern clinical hypothesis that fibrinolytic system can participate in mechanisms of such obstetric complications as pre-term pre-mature rupture of foetal membranes and placental abruption .
