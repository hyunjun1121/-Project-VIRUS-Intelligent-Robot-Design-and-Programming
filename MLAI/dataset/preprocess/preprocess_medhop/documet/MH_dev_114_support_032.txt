An anti-inflammatory mechanism of taurine conjugated DB00244 against experimental colitis : taurine chloramine potentiates inhibitory effect of DB00244 on IL-1beta-mediated NFkappaB activation . Previously , we reported that oral administration of taurine conjugated DB00244 , a colon-specific prodrug of DB00244 ( DB00244 ) , is effective in ameliorating experimental colitis and taurine elicits an additive anti-inflammatory effect upon cotreatment with DB00244 . To explore a molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory property of the prodrug , we investigated the effect of the conjugate on IL-1beta-mediated NFkappaB activation . In human colon carcinoma Caco-2 and HCT116 cells , NFkappaB activity was accessed by a luciferase reporter assay and P05231 secretion . Protein levels were determined by Western blotting . P05231 levels were monitored by an Elisa kit . Treatment with either DB00244 or taurine chloramine ( TauCl ) inhibited IL-1beta-mediated NFkappaB dependent luciferase expression and P05231 secretion . In HCT116 cells , the inhibitory effect by TauCl or DB00244 was through preventing IL-1beta-induced O15111 activation and subsequently interfering with P25963 degradation and p65 nuclear accumulation . Furthermore , combined TauCl/ DB00244 treatment interfered additively with the activation process , leading to additive inhibitory effect on IL-1beta-mediated NFkappaB activation . Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of the prodrug on experimental colitis is attributed to the inhibition of the IL-1beta-mediated NFkappaB activation and the taurine effect is through TauCl potentiating the ability of DB00244 to inhibit IL-1beta dependent NFkappaB activation .
