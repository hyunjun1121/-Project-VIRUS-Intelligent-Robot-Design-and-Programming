Acerogenin A , a natural compound isolated from Acer nikoense Maxim , stimulates osteoblast differentiation through bone morphogenetic protein action . We investigated the effects of acerogenin A , a natural compound isolated from Acer nikoense Maxim , on osteoblast differentiation by using osteoblastic cells . Acerogenin A stimulated the cell proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and RD- P13671 osteoblastic cells ( Runx2-deficient cell line ) . It also increased alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 and RD- P13671 cells and calvarial osteoblastic cells isolated from the calvariae of newborn mice . Acerogenin A also increased the expression of mRNAs related to osteoblast differentiation , including P02818 , Osterix and Runx2 in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts : it also stimulated P02818 and Osterix mRNA expression in RD- P13671 cells . The acerogenin A treatment for 3days increased Bmp-2 , Bmp-4 , and Bmp-7 mRNA expression levels in MC3T3-E1 cells . Adding noggin , a BMP specific-antagonist , inhibited the acerogenin A-induced increase in the P02818 , Osterix and Runx2 mRNA expression levels . These results indicated that acerogenin A stimulates osteoblast differentiation through BMP action , which is mediated by Runx2-dependent and Runx2-independent pathways .
