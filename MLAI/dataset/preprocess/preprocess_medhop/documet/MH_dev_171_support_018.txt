Effect of endothelin receptor antagonists on non-muscle matrix compaction in a cell culture vasospasm model . P05305 ( ET-1 ) , a potent vascular smooth muscle constrictor , is one of the possible spasmogens in cerebral vasospasm . However , the role of ET-1 in non-muscle compaction ( another aspect of the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm ) has not been reported . This study was undertaken to demonstrate the effect of ET-1 , as well as erythrocyte lysate and bloody cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) , on fibroblast populated collagen lattice ( FPCL ) compaction . Human dermal fibroblasts were used to form FPCL . The concentration-dependent effect of ET-1 was examined in the absence and presence of an P25101 receptor antagonist ( BQ-485 ) , or an ETB receptor antagonist ( BQ-788 ) , or both . FPCL compaction was determined by measuring reduction of areas over five days following treatment . To compare the effect of ET-1 on lattice compaction , erythrocyte lysate and bloody P04141 obtained from a cerebral vasospasm patient were also tested . We found that ET-1 increased FPCL compaction in a concentration-dependent ( but not time-dependent ) manner . Erythrocyte lysate produced the strongest compaction , however , without time-dependence . Bloody P04141 promoted FPCL compaction in a time-dependent fashion . Compaction induced by ET-1 was inhibited by BQ-485 but not by BQ-788 . We concluded that ET-1 promotes FPCL compaction by activation of P25101 receptors . Other components in bloody P04141 or erythrocytes may also contribute to FPCL compaction .
