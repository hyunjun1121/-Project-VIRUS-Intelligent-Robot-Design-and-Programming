Angiotensin II promotes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of c-Jun/c-Fos in cardiac fibroblasts . Although c-Jun/c-Fos ( activator protein 1 , P05412 ) contributes importantly to Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis through induction of extracellular matrix protein over-expression in cardiac fibroblasts , the mechanism by which Ang II promotes c-Jun/c-Fos transactivation remains unclear . In this study , we demonstrated that c-Fos and c-Jun were poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in cultured cardiac fibroblasts . Southwestern blot and EMSA assays showed that incubation of nuclear extracts with NAD(+) and active DNA increased the basal DNA binding activities of c-Jun ( 31.0+/-1.0 % , P < 0.01 ) and P05412 ( 14.2+/-3.1 % , P < 0.01 ) ; incubation of recombinant c-Fos or/and c-Jun with P09874 , NAD(+) and active DNA increased the basal DNA binding activities of c-Jun ( 48.3+/-4.2 % , P < 0.01 ) and P05412 ( 21.2+/-1.5 % , P < 0.01 ) . Treatment with Ang II promoted P09874 activation and enhanced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of c-Fos ( 14.1+1.1 % , P < 0.01 ) and c-Jun ( 15.5+/-5.6 % , P < 0.01 ) . Ang II also increased the basal DNA binding activities of c-Jun ( 13.5+/-2.4 % , P < 0.01 ) and P05412 ( 18.7+/-3.5 % , P < 0.01 ) in cultured cells . Inhibition of P09874 by PJ34 or siRNA effectively prevented Ang II-induced increases in the DNA binding of c-Jun and P05412 , and decreased P05412 -driven transcription ( including collagen Ialpha1 and IIIalpha1 , P14780 and P01033 ) . This study illustrated that c-Jun and c-Fos were poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by P09874 , and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation enhanced the DNA binding of P05412 . Ang II promoted poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of c-Jun and c-Fos through activation of P09874 and , subsequently , enhanced P05412 -driven transcription in cardiac fibroblasts .
