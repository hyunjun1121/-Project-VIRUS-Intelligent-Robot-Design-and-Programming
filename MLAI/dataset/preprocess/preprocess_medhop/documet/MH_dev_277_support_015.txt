P29475 -dependent dilation to flow in coronary arteries of male P29474 -KO mice . Flow-induced dilation was examined in isolated coronary arteries of endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase knockout mice ( P29474 -KO ) and wild-type ( WT ) mice . The basal tone of arteries ( percentage of passive diameter ) was significantly greater in P29474 -KO than in WT mice ; their flow-induced dilations , however , were similar . Endothelial removal eliminated the dilations in vessels of both strains of mice . In arteries of WT mice , N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) ( 10(-4) M ) or indomethacin ( 10(-5) M ) alone , inhibited flow-induced dilation by approximately 50 % , whereas their simultaneous administration abolished the responses . In arteries of P29474 -KO mice , flow-induced dilation was inhibited by approximately 40 % with L-NAME . The residual portion ( 60 % ) of the response was eliminated by the additional administration of indomethacin . DB02207 ( 10(-4) M ) attenuated flow-induced dilation by approximately 40 % in arteries of P29474 -KO mice , but did not affect responses in those of WT mice . 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one ( 3 x 10(-5) M ) inhibited the L-NAME/7-nitroindazole-sensitive portion of the responses in arteries of P29474 -KO mice . Immunohistochemical evidence confirms the presence of neuronal NOS ( P29475 ) in the arterial endothelium of P29474 -KO mice . In conclusion , P29475 -derived NO , via activation of cGMP , together with prostaglandins , maintains flow-induced dilation in coronary arteries of male P29474 -KO mice .
