Identification of Reverb(alpha) as a novel ROR(alpha) target gene . The nuclear receptor superfamily comprises a large number of ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in numerous biological processes such as cell proliferation , differentiation , and homeostasis . ROR(alpha) ( P35398 ) and Reverb(alpha) ( P20393 ) are two members of this family whose biological functions are largely unknown . In addition , no ligand has been yet identified for these two receptors ; therefore , they are referred as orphan receptors . Here , we show that ROR(alpha) and Reverb(alpha) are expressed with a similar tissue distribution and are both induced during the differentiation of rat Q9BTT4 myoblastic cells . Ectopic expression of ROR(alpha)1 in Q9BTT4 cells significantly induces Reverb(alpha) expression as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis . Using reverse transcription-PCR to analyze Reverb(alpha) gene expression from staggerer mice , we found that there was a significant reduction of Reverb(alpha) mRNA in the skeletal muscle comparing it with the wild-type mice , which suggests that ROR(alpha) is involved in the regulation of Reverb(alpha) gene expression . Transient transfection assays using the Reverb(alpha) promoter demonstrate that ROR(alpha) regulates the Reverb(alpha) gene at the transcriptional level . Furthermore , mutagenesis experiments indicate that ROR(alpha) regulates Reverb(alpha) transcription via a monomeric ROR response element located in the Reverb(alpha) gene promoter . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that ROR(alpha) binds strongly to this site in a specific-manner . Finally , overexpression of Q9Y3R0 / Q06418 -2 , but not Q15788 , potentiates ROR(alpha)-stimulated Reverb(alpha) promoter activity in transient transfection experiments . Together , our results identify Reverb(alpha) as a novel target gene for ROR(alpha) .
