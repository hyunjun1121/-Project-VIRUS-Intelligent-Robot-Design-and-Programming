Association and interactions between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and adult glioma . It is generally accepted that glioma develops through accumulation of genetic alterations . We hypothesized that polymorphisms of candidate genes involved in the DNA repair pathways may contribute to susceptibility to glioma . To address this possibility , we conducted a study on 373 Caucasian glioma cases and 365 cancer-free Caucasian controls to assess associations between glioma risk and 18 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes . We evaluated potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions using a multianalytic strategy combining logistic regression , multifactor dimensionality reduction and classification and regression tree approaches . In the single-locus analysis , six single-nucleotide polymorphisms [ P07992 3' untranslated region ( UTR ) , P18887 R399Q , P27695 E148D , P09874 A762V , P16455 F84L , and LIG1 5'UTR ] showed a significant association with glioma risk . In the analysis of cumulative genetic risk of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms , a significant gene-dosage effect was found for increased glioma risk with increasing numbers of adverse genotypes involving the aforementioned six single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( P(trend) = 0.0004 ) . Furthermore , the multifactor dimensionality reduction and classification and regression tree analyses identified P16455 F84L as the predominant risk factor for glioma and revealed strong interactions among ionizing radiation exposure , P09874 A762V , P16455 F84L , and P27695 E148D . Interestingly , the risk for glioma was dramatically increased in ionizing radiation exposure individuals who had the wild-type genotypes of P16455 F84L and P09874 A762V ( adjusted odds ratios , 5.95 ; 95 % confidence intervals , 2.21-16.65 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may act individually or together to contribute to glioma risk .
