Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition enhances platelet nitric oxide release . INTRODUCTION : Platelet aggregates form by fibrinogen binding to the membrane receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ( P08514 /IIIa ) . While P08514 /IIIa inhibitors block fibrinogen-platelet binding , stimulation of other functionally important platelet receptors may still occur . Blocking the P08514 /IIIa receptor prevents platelet aggregation but not activation and the subsequent effect on other platelet pathways is largely unknown . MATERIALS AND METHODS : As activated platelets release reactive oxygen species that may influence thrombosis or vascular function , the effect of P08514 /IIIa inhibitors on the platelet release of nitric oxide ( NO ) and superoxide was determined using an electrochemical detector and luminescence , respectively . Location of relevant platelet proteins and the interaction between platelets and leukocytes in the presence or absence of P08514 /IIIa inhibition was determined . RESULTS : Although incubation with P08514 /IIIa inhibitors completely abolished platelet aggregation , stimulation dependent NO release was significantly enhanced . Superoxide is known to alter the bioavailability of NO , and its contribution to the P08514 /IIIa dependent increase in NO release was determined . In the presence of P08514 /IIIa inhibitors , platelet superoxide release was significantly decreased . Preincubation with P08514 /IIIa inhibitors also modified aggregation induced membrane translocation of the platelet proteins , endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) and NADPH oxidase ( p67phox and p47phox ) , known to contribute to the generation of NO and superoxide , respectively . In the presence of leukocytes , abciximab incubation led to enhanced NO release and attenuated superoxide generation . CONCLUSION : These observations suggest that the pharmacological effects of P08514 /IIIa antagonists on platelet function , apart from inhibition of aggregation , may contribute to their efficacy .
