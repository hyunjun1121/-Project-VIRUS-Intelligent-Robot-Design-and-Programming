Intake of vitamin P04264 and K2 and risk of hip fractures : The Hordaland Health Study . BACKGROUND : Evidence of the effect of vitamin K on bone health is conflicting . The aim was to investigate the association between intake of vitamins P04264 and K2 and subsequent risk of hip fracture in a general population sample , as well as potential effect modification by apolipoprotein E gene ( P02649 ) status by presence of the E4 allele . METHODS : 1238 men and 1569 women 71-75 years of age were included in the community-based Hordaland Health Study 1997-1999 in Western Norway . Information on hip fracture was obtained from hospitalizations in the region from enrolment until 31 December 2009 . Information on intake of vitamins P04264 and K2 collected at baseline was used as potential predictors of hip fracture in Cox proportional hazards regression analyses . RESULTS : Participants in the lowest compared to the highest quartile of vitamin P04264 intake had increased risk of suffering a hip fracture ( hazard ratio (HR)=1.57 [ 95 % CI 1.09 , 2.26 ] ) . Vitamin K2 intake was not associated with hip fracture . Presence of APOE4-allele did not increase the risk of hip fracture , nor was there any effect modification with vitamin P04264 in relation to risk of hip fracture . CONCLUSIONS : A low intake of vitamin P04264 , but not K2 , was associated with an increased risk of hip fractures .
