Q99572 receptor-dependent intestinal afferent hypersensitivity in a mouse model of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome . The DB00171 -gated P2X(7) receptor ( P2X(7)R ) was shown to be an important mediator of inflammation and inflammatory pain through its regulation of IL-1β processing and release . Trichinella spiralis-infected mice develop a postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity that is reminiscent of the clinical features associated with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome . In this study , we used P2X(7)R knockout mice ( P2X(7)R(-/-) ) to investigate the role of P2X(7)R activation in the in vivo production of IL-1β and the development of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity in the T. spiralis-infected mouse . During acute nematode infection , IL-1β-containing cells and P2X(7)R expression were increased in the jejunum of wild-type ( WT ) mice . Peritoneal and serum IL-1β levels were also increased , which was indicative of elevated IL-1β release . However , in the P2X(7)R(-/-) animals , we found that infection had no effect upon intracellular , plasma , or peritoneal IL-1β levels . Conversely , infection augmented peritoneal P01375 -α levels in both WT and P2X(7)R(-/-) animals . Infection was also associated with a P2X(7)R-dependent increase in extracellular peritoneal lactate dehydrogenase , and it triggered immunological changes in both strains . Jejunal afferent fiber mechanosensitivity was assessed in uninfected and postinfected WT and P2X(7)R(-/-) animals . Postinfected WT animals developed an augmented afferent fiber response to mechanical stimuli ; however , this did not develop in postinfected P2X(7)R(-/-) animals . Therefore , our results demonstrated that P2X(7)Rs play a pivotal role in intestinal inflammation and are a trigger for the development of visceral hypersensitivity .
