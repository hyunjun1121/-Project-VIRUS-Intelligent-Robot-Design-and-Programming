Second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancers . P00533 mutations identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) than cytotoxic chemotherapy . The distinct success of the first-generation P00533 TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib has been accompanied by the observation that acquired resistance to these treatments develops after a median of 1 year of treatment . Newer , second-generation P00533 TKIs have been developed with the intent to delay or overcome acquired resistance by the broader inhibition of kinases ( eg , P04626 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ) and/or altering the interactions with P00533 through irreversibly binding to the kinase domain . This article discusses many of these agents ( including afatinib , dacomitinib , DB05007 , AP26113 , and CO-1686 ) which have the potential for greater efficacy compared with first-generation P00533 TKIs , and may also have clinical activity against other oncogenic mutations within the P00533 family , including P04626 .
