Administration of adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl transferase antagonist allows in vivo control of anti-dinitrophenyl response . DB03073 ( 3MB ) is one of a series of chemical inhibitors of the nuclear enzyme adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -ribosyl transferase ( P09874 ) , which has been shown to inhibit cell differentiation in vitro , but has no effect on differentiation independent proliferation . Treatment of mice with an optimal concentration of 3MB ( 20 mg/kg body weight ) at or 1 day after dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet haemocyanin ( DNP-KLH ) immunisation reduced anti-DNP plaque-forming cell ( P27918 ) numbers to less than 10 % of those of control animals . The period for maximum P27918 suppression showed a narrow time window relative to immunisation , suggesting that in vivo , as in vitro , 3 MB was acting only on those lymphocytes differentiating in response to antigen . Experimental findings showed that it was possible to select for P27918 derived from different populations of DNP-responsive lymphocytes by adjusting the time of 3MB treatment relative to immunisation . When 3MB was used with antigen priming , the residual P27918 showed a lower average affinity than P27918 in mice treated with 3MB 3 days after priming , suggesting a differential selection of those lymphocytes responding either ' early ' or ' late ' in the primary immune response .
