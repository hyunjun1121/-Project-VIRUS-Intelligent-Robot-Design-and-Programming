[ P62158 -dependent regulation of Ca,Mg-ATPase activity in plasma membranes of the swine myometrium ] . Highly purified plasma membrane ( PM ) preparations of pig myometrium were found to contain 0.91 +/- 0.22 microgram calmodulin per mg of PM protein . Treatment of membranes with 1 mM EGTA in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl causes the diminution of the calmodulin content down to 3 % of the original level . The activity of Ca , Mg-ATPase is thereby decreased by 40 % . Exogenous calmodulin restores the enzyme activity up to 1.94 +/- +/- 0.30 mumol Pi/mg protein/hour . The maximal activation of Ca , Mg-ATPase is observed with 10(-7) M calmodulin . P62158 increases the total ATPase activity of myometrium PM without affecting the Mg-ATPase activity . DB00831 ( 20 microM ) diminishes the activating effect of exogenous calmodulin on Ca , Mg-ATPase . P62158 stimulates Ca , Mg-ATPase at low concentrations of Ca2+ ( 10(-8)-10(-6) M ) by decreasing Km for Ca2+ from 0.4.10(-6) M to 2.10(-8) M as well as by increasing Vmax -- from 0,8 to 1.42 mumol Pl/mg protein/hour . It is supposed that the activating effect of calmodulin on Ca , Mg-ATPase is based on electrostatic interactions of Ca2+-free calmodulin with the enzyme .
