Genome-wide association scan of the time to onset of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . A time-to-onset analysis for family-based samples was performed on the genomewide association ( GWAS ) data for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) to determine if associations exist with the age at onset of ADHD . The initial dataset consisted of 958 parent-offspring trios that were genotyped on the Perlegen 600,000 SNP array . After data cleaning procedures , 429,981 autosomal SNPs and 930 parent-offspring trios were used found suitable for use and a family-based logrank analysis was performed using that age at first ADHD symptoms as the quantitative trait of interest . No SNP achieved genome-wide significance , and the lowest P-values had a magnitude of 10(-7) . Several SNPs among a pre-specified list of candidate genes had nominal associations including Q8IVB4 , P21728 , P07550 , Q01959 , Q16649 , P08588 , P21579 , P28223 , P32121 , and P43681 . Of these findings Q8IVB4 stood out as a promising candidate , with nominally significant SNPs in six distinct regions of the gene .
