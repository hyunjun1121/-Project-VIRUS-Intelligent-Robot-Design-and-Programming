Targeting eIF4GI translation initiation factor affords an attractive therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma . BACKGROUND : Deregulation of protein synthesis is integral to the malignant phenotype and translation initiation is the rate limiting stage . Therefore , eIF4F translation initiation complex components are attractive therapeutic targets . METHODS : Protein lysates of myeloma cells ( cell lines/patients ' bone marrow samples ) untreated/treated with bevacizumab were assayed for eIF4GI expression , regulation ( P15559 /proteosome dependent fragmentation ) ( WB , DB00266 , qPCR ) and targets (WB). eIF4GI was inhibited by knockdown and 4EGI-1 . Cells were tested for viability ( ELISA ) , death ( FACS ) and eIF4GI targets ( WB ) . RESULTS : Previously , we have shown that manipulation of P15692 in myeloma cells attenuated P06730 dependent translation initiation . Here we assessed the significance of eIF4GI to MM cells . We demonstrated increased expression of eIF4GI in myeloma cells and its attenuation upon P15692 inhibition attributed to elevated P15559 /proteasome dependent fragmentation and diminished mRNA levels . Knockdown of eIF4GI was deleterious to myeloma cells phenotype and expression of specific molecular targets ( Q99717 /ERα/HIF1α/c-Myc ) . Finally , we showed that the small molecule 4EGI-1 inhibits eIF4GI and causes a reduction in expression of its molecular targets in myeloma . CONCLUSION : Our findings substantiate that translation initiation of particular targets in MM is contingent on the function of eIF4GI , critical to cell phenotype , and mark it as a viable target for pharmacological intervention .
