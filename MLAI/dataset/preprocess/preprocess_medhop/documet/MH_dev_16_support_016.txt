High glucose-mediated imbalance of nitric oxide synthase and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase expression in endothelial cells . The mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction are multifactorial . A correlation between oxidative stress and derangements of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) pathways in altered endothelial homeostasis has been most studied and demonstrated in different pathophysiological conditions . NOS activities are regulated by endogenous inhibitors such as asymmetric DB01686 ( DB01686 ) that is metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ( DDAH ) . Since recent data demonstrated that some endothelial dysfunction may be related to reduced expression and/or activity of DDAH , the aim of the present research was to investigate the expression of O95865 and NOS isoforms in high glucose-mediated oxidative stress . Endothelial cells were incubated with normal ( 7 mM ) and high concentrations ( 33 mM ) of D-glucose for 5 days ; mannose ( 26 mM ) plus D-glucose ( 7 mM ) was used as osmotic control . Data obtained in the present study show that the exposure for 5 days to high glucose increases oxidative stress , reduces O95865 and P29474 expression and increases P35228 expression . These results indicate that O95865 and P35228 / P29474 dysregulation may play a key role in high glucose-mediated oxidative stress , suggesting that selective modulation of DDAH isoforms may result in selective inhibition/activation of NOS isoforms , thereby providing a novel strategy of approach in vascular complications of several pathologies .
