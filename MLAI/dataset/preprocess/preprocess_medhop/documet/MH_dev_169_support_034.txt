Therapeutic Implications of a Specific Murine Monoclonal Antibody ( DB00054 ) to the Platelet Receptor P08514 /IIIa . The murine monoclonal antibody 7E3 blocks the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor , and is a potent inhibitor of platelet function in both animals and man . Animal models of the acute coronary syndromes suggest that 7E3 abolishes the in vivo formation of platelet thrombi , accelerates thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator , and prevents subsequent reocclusion . Human studies with 7E3 suggest that complete inhibition of platelet function may be safely undertaken for periods of up to 36 h , and preliminary studies indicate effectiveness in the therapy of clinical unstable angina . Potential problems with its use include immunogenicity and thrombocytopenia . The outcome of the acute coronary thrombotic syndromes , which include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction and abrupt closure following coronary angioplasty , may be significantly improved with 7E3 therapy .
