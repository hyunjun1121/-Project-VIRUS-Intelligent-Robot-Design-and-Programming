Transcriptional profiling of Francisella tularensis infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells : a predictive tool for tularemia . In this study , we analyzed temporal gene expression patterns in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) infected with the Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain from 1 to 24 h utilizing a whole human Affymetrix gene chip . We found that a considerable number of induced genes had similar expression patterns and functions as reported previously for gene expression profiling in patients with ulceroglandular tularemia . Among the six uniquely regulated genes reported for tularemia patients as being part of the alarm signal gene cluster , five , namely caspase 1 , Q9UL46 , TAP-1 , P32455 , and P30793 , were induced in vitro . We also detected four out of the seven potential biomarkers reported in tularemia patients , namely P98066 at 4 h and P42224 , P50591 , and Q8WVN6 at 16 and 24 h . These observations underscore the value of using microarray expression profiling as an in vitro tool to identify potential biomarkers for human infection and disease . Our results indicate the potential involvement of several host pathways/processes in Francisella infection , notably those involved in calcium , zinc ion binding , Q07869 signaling , and lipid metabolism , which further refines the current knowledge of F. tularensis infection and its effects on the human host . Ultimately , this study provides support for utilizing in vitro microarray gene expression profiling in human PBMCs to identify biomarkers of infection and predict in vivo immune responses to infectious agents .
