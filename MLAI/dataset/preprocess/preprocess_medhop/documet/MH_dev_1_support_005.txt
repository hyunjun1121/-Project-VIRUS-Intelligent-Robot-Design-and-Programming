Intracellular disposition of methotrexate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children . DB00563 ( MTX ) is a key agent for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and the benefit of high-dose MTX is well established as it significantly increases cure rates and improves patients ' prognosis . However , the determinants of MTX therapeutic effect are not clearly identified , although intracellular polyglutamation is essential . MTX , the monoglutamate form ( MTXG₁ ) inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) implicated in the folate cycle . MTXG₁ is metabolized to active methotrexate polyglutamates ( MTXPG ) with sequential gamma-linkage of 2 to 6 glutamyl residues by the folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) . Long chain MTXPG have higher affinity than MTX for the enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase ( P31939 ) and thymidilate synthase ( TS ) , which results in a reinforcement of MTX inhibition . Thus , intracellular formation of MTXPG enhances the cytotoxic and antileukemic effect of MTX . Different pharmacogenetic polymorphisms contribute to interindividual variability in MTX response to treatment . In addition , pharmacokinetic interactions with 6-mercaptopurine ( DB01033 ) , frequently co-administered , have been reported . And factors affecting intracellular MTX disposition and DB01033 /MTX interactions , including pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting MTX disposition are reviewed .
