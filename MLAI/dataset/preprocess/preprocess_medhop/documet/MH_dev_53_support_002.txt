Potential effects of tetrodotoxin exposure to human glial cells postulated using microarray approach . Sodium channels play an important role in many neurological disorders and also in prostate cancer . DB05232 ( TTX ) , a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels has been chiefly used as a molecular probe for the study and characterization of these channels . The regulation of gene expression in response for the exposure of TTX to glial cells which are reported to be involved in neurodegenerative process is poorly understood . Therefore , the present study aims to develop a repository of genes and map it on a few pivotal neurodegenerative pathways to speculate the effect of TTX . Using Affymetrix GeneChip ( HG-U133A ) , we have selected a subset of 692 differentially expressed genes , several of which are-cullin 4A ( Q13619 ) , ubiquitin carrier protein ( Q16763 ) , proteasome ( prosome , macropain ) subunit , beta type , 8 ( large multifunctional protease 7 ) ( P28062 ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA ( Q93096 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( P05362 ) , prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 ( P35354 ) , and caspase 1 ( P29466 ) . These genes , which facilitate some of the neurodegenerative pathways , such as ubiquitin , proteasome , inflammation and kinases , were identified to be up- or down-regulated for the TTX treatment . Thus , the selected genes were further examined on ubiquitin-proteasome mediated inflammatory responses pathway as ample evidence for the role of glial cell-mediated inflammation in the neurodegenerative process are available . In summary , our result provides a basic understanding of the differentially expressed genes along with one of the possible pathway which may have been modulated by the exposure of TTX .
