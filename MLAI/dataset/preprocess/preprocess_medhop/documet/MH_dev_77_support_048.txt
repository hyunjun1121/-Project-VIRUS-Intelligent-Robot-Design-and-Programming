Comparison of the catalytic properties of the botulinum neurotoxin subtypes A1 and A5 . Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) cause the life-threatening disease botulism through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release by cleaving essential SNARE proteins . There are seven serologically distinctive types of BoNTs and many subtypes within a serotype have been identified . BoNT/A5 is a recently discovered subtype of type A botulinum neurotoxin which possesses a very high degree of sequence similarity and identity to the well-studied A1 subtype . In the present study , we examined the endopeptidase activity of these two DB00083 subtypes and our results revealed significant differences in substrate binding and cleavage efficiency between subtype A5 and A1 . Distinctive hydrolysis efficiency was observed between the two toxins during cleavage of the native substrate P60880 versus a shortened peptide mimic . N-terminal truncation studies demonstrated that a key region of the P60880 , including the amino acid residues at 151 through 154 located in the remote binding region of the substrate , contributed to the differential catalytic properties between A1 and A5 . Elevated binding affinity of the peptide substrate resulted from including these important residues and enhanced BoNT/A5 's hydrolysis efficiency . In addition , mutations of these amino acid residues affect the proteolytic performance of the two toxins in different ways . This study provides a better understanding of the biological activity of these toxins , their performance characteristics in the Endopep-MS assay to detect BoNT in clinical samples and foods , and is useful for the development of peptide substrates .
