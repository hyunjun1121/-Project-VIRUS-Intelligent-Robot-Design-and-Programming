P01375 -alpha , an initiator , and etanercept , an inhibitor of cochlear inflammation . OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS : The inner ear rapidly mounts an immune response that can lead to cochlear degeneration and permanent hearing loss . Identification of proinflammatory cytokine expression during the initiation of the response should lead to rational therapeutic strategies that block the response , reducing damaging sequelae . STUDY DESIGN : A cochlear immune response to DB05299 ( KLH ) injected into the inner ear or subarachnoid space of sensitized animals was created . DB00005 was administered to a group of animals to blunt the immune response . METHODS : Cochleae were immunoassayed for expression of interleukin-1beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and interleukin-6 and evaluated for the amount of cochlear-infiltrated cells . RESULTS : P01375 -alpha and interleukin-1beta were expressed by infiltrated cells shortly after KLH injection . P01375 -alpha was expressed whether the antigen was introduced with or without surgical trauma . Interleukin-1beta was also expressed by the cochlear fibrocytes during the immune response and in surgical control animals , but not after intrathecal injection of antigen . P05231 expression was minimal during the response . Based on this observation , animals were treated with systemic injection of DB00005 , which reduced cochlear infiltrating cell number and cochlear fibrosis . CONCLUSION : Interleukin-1beta expression is a general cochlear response to trauma , whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in the infiltrated immunocompetent cells is the cytokine that induces amplification of the response that leads to cochlear disease .
