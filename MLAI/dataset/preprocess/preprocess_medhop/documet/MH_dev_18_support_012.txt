Traditional Korean Herbal Formula Samsoeum Attenuates Adipogenesis by Regulating the Phosphorylation of P27361 /2 in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 Cells . Adipogenesis is the cell differentiation process from preadipocytes into adipocytes and the critical action in the development of obesity . In the present study , we conducted in vitro analyses to investigate the inhibitory effects of Samsoeum ( SSE ) , a traditional herbal decoction . SSE had no significant cytotoxic effect against either the undifferentiated or differentiated 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells . Oil Red O staining results showed that SSE significantly inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes . SSE treatment consistently reduced the intracellular triglyceride content in the cells . SSE significantly inactivated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GPDH ) , a major link between carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes , and markedly inhibited the production of leptin , an important adipokine , in differentiated cells . SSE markedly suppressed the mRNA expression of the adipogenesis-related genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( Q07869 -γ ) , CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha ( C/EBP-α ) , fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , lipoprotein lipase ( P06858 ) , and fatty acid binding protein 4 ( P15090 ) . Importantly , SSE increased the phosphorylation of P27361 /2 , but not p38 MAPK and JNK , in adipose cells . Overall , our results indicate that SSE exerts antiadipogenic activity and modulates expressions of adipogenesis-related genes and P27361 /2 activation in adipocytes .
