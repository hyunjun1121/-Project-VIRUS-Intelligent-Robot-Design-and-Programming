Initial responses of osteoblasts derived from human alveolar bone to various compressive forces . Mechanical stress generated by orthodontic force is recognized as a major factor in the modulation of alveolar bone remodeling . During this process , osteoblasts play a crucial role , not only by participating in bone formation but also by promoting osteoclastogenesis . The aim of this study was to investigate how continuous compressive force ( CF ) affects human primary osteoblasts ( HOBs ) in terms of cell proliferation , apoptosis , and expression of interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) and chemokine CXC ligand 8 ( P10145 ) . Human primary osteoblasts , isolated from human mandibular bone pieces , were cultured with or without CF ( 1-4 g cm(-2) ) for up to 72 h . Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the MTT assay . RT-PCR was used to determine the levels of expression of KI67 ( a proliferation marker ) , Q07812 ( a pro-apoptotic marker ) , P10415 ( an apoptotic inhibitor ) , P05231 , and P10145 mRNAs , while a multiplexed bead immunoassay was used to measure the release of P05231 and P10145 . The results revealed that CF decreased cell viability and proliferation in a time- and force-dependent manner . After applying CF for 24 h , the mRNA expression of KI67 was markedly inhibited , whereas the mRNA expression of Q07812 and P10415 was unaltered . In addition , CF enhanced the levels of P05231 and P10145 mRNAs in a force-dependent manner , whereas the levels of the corresponding proteins were reduced in the compressed HOBs .
