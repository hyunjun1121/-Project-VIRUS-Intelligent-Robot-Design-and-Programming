A clinical trial with chimeric monoclonal antibody DB05304 and low dose interleukin-2 pulsing scheme for advanced renal cell carcinoma . PURPOSE : DB05304 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to carbonic anhydrase IX( Q16790 /MN) , which is present on greater than 95 % of RCCs of the clear cell subtype . The suggested working mechanism of DB05304 is by ADCC . Because the number of activated ADCC effector cells can be increased by a low dose interleukin-2 pulsing schedule , a multicenter study was initiated to investigate whether DB05304 combined with LD- P60568 could lead to an improved clinical outcome in patients with progressive RCC . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 35 patients with progressive clear cell RCC received weekly infusions of DB05304 for 11 weeks combined with a daily LD- P60568 regimen . Patients were monitored longitudinally for ADCC capacity . Radiological assessment of metastatic lesions was performed at week 16 and regularly until disease progression . RESULTS : A durable clinical benefit was achieved in 8 of 35 patients ( 23 % ) , including 3 with a partial response and 5 with stabilization at 24 weeks or greater . Mean survival was 22 months . In general treatment was well tolerated with little toxicity . The number of effector cells increased during treatment but lytic capacity per cell did not increase . ADCC and clinical outcome did not appear to correlate . CONCLUSIONS : DB05304 combined with LD- P60568 in patients with metastatic RCC is safe and well tolerated . With a substantial clinical benefit and a median survival of 22 months in patients with metastatic RCC who have progressive disease at study entry combination therapy showed increased overall survival compared to DB05304 monotherapy . Survival was at least similar to that of currently used cytokine regimens but with a favorable toxicity profile .
