Prevalence of genetic risk factors for coronary artery disease in Corsica island ( France ) . We have investigated the frequencies of seven markers among 100 unrelated individuals with angiographically documented CAD ( Coronary Artery Disease ) and among 100 unrelated healthy blood donors in the central region of Corsica island ( France ) . The seven polymorphisms analyzed were chosen from six candidate genes involved in ( 1 ) P00797 -Angiotensin system : Angiotensin converting enzyme ( P12821 I/D ) , ( 2 ) Lipid metabolism : DB04540 Ester Transfer Protein gene ( P11597 TAQ1B ) , ( 3 ) Platelet aggregation : alpha and beta subunits of the platelet GpIIb/GpIIIa integrin complex ( GpIIb HPA3 and GpIIIa Pl(A1/A2) ) , ( 4 ) Coagulation fibrinolysis : P00747 Activator Tissue ( P00750 TPA25 I/D ) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase ( P42898 C677T and A1298C ) . The samples were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis for the RFLPs . No significant difference in allele frequencies between patient and control groups was observed . The occurrence of the P42898 T677T genotype and of the T677T/A1298A compound genotype is higher in cases ( 20 % ) than in the controls ( 4 % ) . Odds ratio seems to indicate that individuals with the P42898 T677T genotype and the T677T/A1298A compound genotype had a 6-fold increased risk for developing CAD ( ORs = 6 ; 95 % CIs = 1.96-18.28 ) suggesting a possible association of P42898 C677T with the risk of CAD in Corsican population .
