DB00183 infusions in patients with panic disorder . II. Neuroendocrinology . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) has well-documented anxiogenic effects in animals and normal people , and panicogenic effects in patients with panic disorder , but little is known about its neuroendocrine profile . We examined neuroendocrine responses to intravenous infusions of pentagastrin , a selective P32239 agonist , in 10 patients with panic disorder and 10 normal control subjects . DB00183 potently activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Q9Y251 ) axis , but did not release growth hormone or any of several vasoactive peptides ( neurokinin A , DB05875 , vasoactive intestinal peptide ) . The Q9Y251 axis response was unrelated to increases in symptoms . Panic patients did not differ from controls in neuroendocrine responses to the CCK agonist . Differential sensitivity to novelty stress accounted for the only patient-control differences in neuroendocrine profiles . The data suggest that CCK may help modulate normal Q9Y251 axis activity , but its anxiogenic effects are unrelated to its stimulatory effects on the Q9Y251 axis . DB00183 provides a safe and readily available probe for further study of CCK receptor systems in humans .
