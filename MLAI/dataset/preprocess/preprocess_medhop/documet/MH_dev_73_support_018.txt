Increased mortality , hypoactivity , and hypoalgesia in cannabinoid P21554 receptor knockout mice . Delta9- DB00470 ( Delta9-THC ) , the major psychoactive ingredient in preparations of Cannabis sativa ( marijuana , hashish ) , elicits central nervous system ( CNS ) responses , including cognitive alterations and euphoria . These responses account for the abuse potential of cannabis , while other effects such as analgesia suggest potential medicinal applications . To study the role of the major known target of cannabinoids in the CNS , the P21554 cannabinoid receptor , we have produced a mouse strain with a disrupted P21554 gene . P21554 knockout mice appeared healthy and fertile , but they had a significantly increased mortality rate . They also displayed reduced locomotor activity , increased ring catalepsy , and hypoalgesia in hotplate and formalin tests . Delta9-THC-induced ring-catalepsy , hypomobility , and hypothermia were completely absent in P21554 mutant mice . In contrast , we still found Delta9-THC-induced analgesia in the tail-flick test and other behavioral ( licking of the abdomen ) and physiological ( diarrhea ) responses after Delta9-THC administration . Thus , most , but not all , CNS effects of Delta9-THC are mediated by the P21554 receptor .
