Favorable coagulation profile with fondaparinux after hip surgery in elderly patients . Twenty-three patients with fondaparinux prophylaxis over 75 years of age who underwent hip fracture surgery were enrolled in the study . DB00569 ( 2.5 mg ) was administered subcutaneously 6 h postoperatively and then every 24 h for 28 days . Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were measured preoperatively , then 10 h , 2 , 7 , and 28 days postoperatively . Increased D-dimers , positive acute phase proteins , and P05231 , and decreased negative acute phase proteins were observed preoperatively ( P < 0.05 ) . Maximum values were reached 10 h postoperatively for P05231 and D-dimer , and on postoperative days 2 and 7 for positive acute phase proteins ( P < 0.05 ) . P02787 , prealbumin and antithrombin levels were lowest 10 h postoperatively and on postoperative day 2 ( P < 0.05 ) . Increased D-dimers , P05231 , and positive acute phase proteins , and decreased negative acute phase proteins persisted until postoperative day 28 ( P < 0.05 ) . P00734 fragments ( F1 + 2 ) reached peak levels preoperatively and decreased gradually until postoperative day 28 . Fondaparinux promoted the inhibition of thrombin generation , as documented by negative correlation between F1 + 2 and FXa inhibition ( r = -0.46 ; P < 0.001 ) . Fondaparinux-induced FXa inhibition increased gradually until postoperative day 28 . This increase correlated positively with antithrombin activity ( r = 0.4 ; P < 0.05 ) . Fondaparinux prophylaxis counteracted pro-thrombogenic effect associated with hip fracture and subsequent surgery without severe bleeding complications .
