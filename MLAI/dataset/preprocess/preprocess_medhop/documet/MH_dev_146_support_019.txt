Levels of surfactant proteins A and D and P15941 are elevated in the induced sputum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients : a sequential sputum analysis . BACKGROUND : Recent clinical studies have suggested that serum surfactant protein ( SP ) A , P35247 and P15941 ( P15941 ) are potential biomarkers for interstitial lung diseases . Serum levels of SP-A and P35247 have also been found to be elevated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) , but their significance has not been evaluated or compared in induced sputum samples obtained directly from the airways . OBJECTIVE : A sequential sputum analysis was conducted to assess the value of SP-A , P35247 and P15941 levels in P48444 . METHODS : The study material consisted of induced sputum samples from 61 subjects , 28 with P48444 and 33 with prolonged cough ( cough lasting > 3 weeks and normal spirometry ) . Sputum was collected in 3 fractions ( 3 periods of 5 min each ) . Sputum levels of these proteins were measured , and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to evaluate the sensitivity , specificity and area under the curve ( AUC ) for each fraction . RESULTS : The levels of SP-A , P35247 and P15941 were higher in patients with P48444 than in those with prolonged cough in each of the fractions . Sputum levels of these proteins correlated inversely with obstruction and positively with ageing , smoking history , sputum macrophages and eosinophils . Sputum fractionation had a relatively minor effect on the levels and AUC of these proteins . CONCLUSION : Sequential sputum analysis from 3 consecutive fractions indicated a significant difference in the levels of SP-A , P35247 and P15941 between P48444 and prolonged cough . However , sputum fractionation itself had a relatively minor effect on the levels of these proteins .
