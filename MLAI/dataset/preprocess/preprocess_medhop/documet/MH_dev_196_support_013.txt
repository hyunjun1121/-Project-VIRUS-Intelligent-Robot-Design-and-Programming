Structure-function studies of linear and cyclized peptide antagonists of the P30968 . Structurally new analogs of the peptidic P30968 antagonist DB00050 as well as conformationally constrained cyclized deca- or pentapeptides were synthesized and selected peptides evaluated comprehensively . To understand how structural variations of the antagonistic peptide effect pharmacodynamic properties , binding affinities and antagonistic potencies toward the human and rat P30968 were determined . Whereas large substituents in position 6 of linear peptides are compatible with high binding affinity ( K(D) < 0.5 nM ) , all cyclized peptides except the cyclo[3-10] analog D-52391 depicted low binding affinity ( K(D) > 10 nM ) . Binding affinity and antagonistic potency in vitro correlated for all peptides and surprisingly no discrimination between human and rat receptor proteins was observed . Since receptor residues W(101) and N(102) are involved in agonist and antagonist binding , equally potent but structurally different antagonists were tested for binding to the respective W(101)A and N(102)A mutants . In contrast to linear decapeptides , residues N(102) and W(101) are not involved in binding of D-23938 and W(101) is the critical residue for D-52391 binding . We conclude that although equally potent , peptidic P30968 antagonists do have distinct interactions within the ligand binding pocket . Finally , selected antagonists were tested for testosterone suppression in male rats . The duration of testosterone suppression below castration levels differed largely from 1 day for DB06785 to 27 days for D-23487 . Systemic availability became evident as the most important parameter for in vivo efficacy .
