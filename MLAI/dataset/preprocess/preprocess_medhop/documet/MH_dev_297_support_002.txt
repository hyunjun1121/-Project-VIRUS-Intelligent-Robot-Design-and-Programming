Heme oxygenase-1 attenuates glucose-mediated cell growth arrest and apoptosis in human microvessel endothelial cells . Heme oxygenase-1 ( P09601 ) is a stress protein that has been suggested to participate in defense mechanisms against agents that may induce oxidative injury , such as heme and inflammatory molecules . Incubation of endothelial cells in a high-glucose ( 33 mmol/L ) medium for 7 days resulted in a decrease of HO activity by 34 % and a decrease in P09601 and P30519 proteins compared with cells exposed to low glucose ( 5 mmol/L ) ( P < 0.05 ) or cells exposed to mannitol ( 33 mmol/L ) . Overexpression of P09601 was coupled with an increase in HO activity and carbon monoxide synthesis , decreased cellular heme , and acceleration in all phases of the cell cycle ( P < 0.001 ) . The rate of cell cycle or cell birth rate was increased by 29 % ( P < 0.05 ) in cells overexpressing P09601 but decreased by 23 % ( P < 0.05 ) in cells underexpressing P09601 compared with control cells . Exposure to high glucose significantly decreased cell-cycle progression in control cells and in cells underexpressing P09601 but did not decrease cell-cycle progression in cells overexpressing P09601 . High glucose induced P38936 and p27 in control cells but not in cells overexpressing P09601 . The addition of DB04912 ( DB04912 ) , an inhibitor of HO activity , reversed the P09601 -mediated decrease of P38936 and p27 in cells overexpressing P09601 . These findings identify a novel effect of P09601 on endothelial cell growth and indicate that heme metabolism and P09601 expression regulate signaling systems in cells exposed to high glucose , which controls cell-cycle progression .
