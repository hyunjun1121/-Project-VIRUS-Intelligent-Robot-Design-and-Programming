Enhanced killing of cancer cells by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors and topoisomerase I inhibitors reflects poisoning of both enzymes . Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) plays critical roles in the regulation of DNA repair . Accordingly , small molecule inhibitors of PARP are being developed as agents that could modulate the activity of genotoxic chemotherapy , such as topoisomerase I poisons . In this study we evaluated the ability of the PARP inhibitor veliparib to enhance the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I poisons topotecan and camptothecin ( CPT ) . DB07232 increased the cell cycle and cytotoxic effects of topotecan in multiple cell line models . Importantly , this sensitization occurred at veliparib concentrations far below those required to substantially inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer synthesis and at least an order of magnitude lower than those involved in selective killing of homologous recombination-deficient cells . Further studies demonstrated that veliparib enhanced the effects of CPT in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) but not Parp1(-/-) MEFs , confirming that P09874 is the critical target for this sensitization . Importantly , parental and Parp1(-/-) MEFs had indistinguishable CPT sensitivities , ruling out models in which P09874 catalytic activity plays a role in protecting cells from topoisomerase I poisons . To the contrary , cells were sensitized to CPT in a veliparib-independent manner upon transfection with P09874 E988K , which lacks catalytic activity , or the isolated P09874 DNA binding domain . These results are consistent with a model in which small molecule inhibitors convert P09874 into a protein that potentiates the effects of topoisomerase I poisons by binding to damaged DNA and preventing its normal repair .
