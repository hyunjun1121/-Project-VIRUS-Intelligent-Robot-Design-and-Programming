P03372 β ( ERβ1 ) transactivation is differentially modulated by the transcriptional coregulator Q92993 in a cis-acting element-dependent manner . P03372 ( ER ) β1 and ERα have overlapping and distinct functions despite their common use of estradiol as the physiological ligand . These attributes are explained in part by their differential utilization of coregulators and ligands . Although Q92993 has been shown to interact with both receptors , its regulatory role in ERβ1 transactivation has not been defined . In this study , we found that Q92993 enhances transactivation of ERβ1 at the AP-1 site but suppresses its transcriptional activity at the estrogen-response element ( ERE ) site in an estradiol-independent manner . However , different estrogenic compounds can modify the Q92993 action . The corepressor activity of Q92993 at the ERE site is abolished by diarylpropionitrile , genistein , equol , and bisphenol A , whereas its coactivation at the AP-1 site is augmented by fulvestrant ( DB00947 ) . GRIP1 is an important tethering mediator for ERs at the AP-1 site . We found that coexpression of GRIP1 synergizes the action of Q92993 . Although Q92993 is a known acetyltransferase , it is unable to acetylate ERβ1 , and its coregulatory functions are independent of its acetylation activity . In addition , we showed the co-occupancy of ERβ1 and Q92993 at ERE and AP-1 sites of ERβ1 target genes . Q92993 differentially regulates the endogenous expression of the target genes by modulating the binding of ERβ1 to the cis-regulatory regions . Thus , we have identified Q92993 as the first dual-function coregulator of ERβ1 .
