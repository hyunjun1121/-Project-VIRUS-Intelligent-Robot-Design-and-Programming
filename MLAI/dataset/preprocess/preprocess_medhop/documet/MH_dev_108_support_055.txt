[ Research update of anti- P01375 -α biologic agents in the treatment of uveitis ] . Uveitis is one of the common sight-threatening eye diseases , which is usually recurrent and refractory to treatment . It is generally considered that the development of uveitis is closely related to the autoimmune response of uvea . P01375 ( P01375 ) -α is one of the key cytokines involved in the emergence and progression of uveitis . Blocking the production or inhibiting the activity of P01375 -α can inhibit the development or progression of uveitis . Presently , the commercially available P01375 -α blockers include infliximab , adalimumab , etanercept , and DB06674 . This review describes the clinical studies and adverse effects of P01375 -α blockers in the treatment of uveitis , and discusses the principle for clinical use of P01375 -α blockers in synergy with other immunosuppressive agents .
