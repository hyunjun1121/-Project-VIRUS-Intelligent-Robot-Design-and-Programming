Dysregulation of leukocyte gene expression in women with medication-refractory depression versus healthy non-depressed controls . BACKGROUND : Depressive Disorders ( DD ) are a great financial and social burden . Females display 70 % higher rate of depression than males and more than 30 % of these patients do not respond to conventional medications . Thus medication-refractory female patients are a large , under-served , group where new biological targets for intervention are greatly needed . METHODS : We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) to evaluate mRNA gene expression from peripheral blood leukocytes for 27 genes , including immune , Q9Y251 -axis , ion channels , and growth and transcription factors . Our sample included 23 females with medication refractory DD : 13 with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , 10 with bipolar disorder ( BPD ) . Our comparison group was 19 healthy , non-depressed female controls . We examined differences in mRNA expression in DD vs. controls , in MDD vs. BPD , and in patients with greater vs. lesser depression severity . RESULTS : DD patients showed increased expression for P22301 , P05231 , P30559 , Q99572 , P47900 , and Q8NER1 . BPD patients showed increased P05067 , P16220 , P19838 , P04150 , and P09486 and decreased P01375 expression . Depression severity was related to increased P22301 , P47900 , P51575 , and Q9HBA0 expression . CONCLUSIONS : These results support prior findings of dysregulation in immune genes , and provide preliminary evidence of dysregulation in purinergic and other ion channels in females with medication-refractory depression , and in transcription and growth factors in those with BPD . If replicated in future research examining protein levels as well as mRNA , these pathways could potentially be used to explore biological mechanisms of depression and to develop new drug targets .
