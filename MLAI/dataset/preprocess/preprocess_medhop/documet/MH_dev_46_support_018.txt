Neuropeptide Y induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via calcineurin signaling in rats . Neuropeptide Y ( P01303 ) has been shown to participate in cardiac hypertrophy . However , the mechanisms by which P01303 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are poorly understood . This study tested the hypothesis that P01303 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent calcineurin ( CaN ) pathway in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes . After 24-h treatment , P01303 ( 100 nM ) significantly increased 3H-leucine incorporation and c-Jun mRNA expression , concomitant with augment of CaN activity and protein level in cardiomyocytes compared to those cells without P01303 treatment . The enhancement of 3H-leucine incorporation and c-Jun mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes treated with P01303 were markedly inhibited by cyclosporine A ( DB00091 ) , a selective inhibitor of CaN . We also investigated the effect of P01303 on intracellular Ca2+ level in cardiomyocytes . There were no obvious changes in intracellular Ca2+ level of cytoplasm and nucleus in cardiomyocytes treated with P01303 ( 100 nM ) for 10 min . However , P01303 significantly increased intracellular Ca2+ level of cytoplasm and nucleus in cardiomyocytes after 24-h treatment . The result suggested that P01303 could induce hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes via Ca2+/ P62158 -dependent CaN signal pathway . The enhancement of [Ca2+]i caused by P01303 may activate CaN signal pathways to mediate cardiac hypertrophy .
