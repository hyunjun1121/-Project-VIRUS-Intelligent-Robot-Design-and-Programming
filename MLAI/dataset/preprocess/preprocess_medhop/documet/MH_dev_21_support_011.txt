Development of peptidomimetic ligands of Pro- DB00149 - DB00145 -NH(2) as allosteric modulators of the dopamine D(2) receptor . A variety of stable , small-molecule peptidomimetic ligands have been developed to elucidate the mechanism by which the neuropeptide Pro- DB00149 - DB00145 -NH(2) ( P00747 ) modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission . Photoaffinity labeling ligands based upon P00747 peptidomimetics have been used to establish that P00747 binds to the P14416 at a site that is different from the orthosteric site , thus making P00747 and its peptidomimetics allosteric modulators of the dopamine receptor . Through the design , synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics containing lactam , bicyclic , and spiro-bicyclic scaffolds , support was provided for the hypothesis that the bioactive conformation of P00747 is a type II β-turn . In addition , studies with peptidomimetics designed to mimic either a type VI β-turn or polyproline II helix conformation yielded molecules that were able to modulate dopamine receptors because of their ability to place the carboxamide NH(2) pharmacophore in the same topological space as that seen in the type II β-turn . Extensive studies with the spiro-bicyclic P00747 peptidomimetics also established that both positive and negative modes of modulation were possible for the same series of peptidomimetics simply as a result of minor differences in the stereochemistry about the bridgehead carbon within the scaffold . This information was used to transform existing positive modulators into negative modulators , which demonstrated that small structural changes in the spiro-bicyclic dopamine receptor modulators are capable of causing major changes in the modulatory activity of P00747 peptidomimetics .
