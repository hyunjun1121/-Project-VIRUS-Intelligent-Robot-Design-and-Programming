P78347 enhances activation of the c-fos promoter through interactions with upstream elements . The transcription factor P78347 was initially isolated as a factor that can bind to initiator elements in core promoters . Recent evidence suggests that P78347 may also have a role in signal transduction . We have found that overexpression of P78347 can enhance the response of the wild-type c-fos promoter to a variety of stimuli . This effect depends on the c-fos DB00102 -platelet-derived growth factor-inducible factor binding element ( SIE ) and serum response element ( SRE ) . There is no effect of cotransfected P78347 on the TATA box containing the c-fos basal promoter . Three P78347 binding sites can be found in c-fos promoter . Two of these overlap the c-fos SIE and SRE , and another is located just upstream of the TATA box . Mutations that distinguish between serum response factor ( P11831 ) , P35610 , and P78347 binding to the c-fos SIE and SRE suggest that the binding of P78347 to these elements is important for c-fos induction in conjunction with the P11831 and P35610 transcription factors . Moreover , P78347 can form in vivo protein-protein complexes with the c-fos upstream activators P11831 , P42224 , and P40763 . These results suggest that P78347 may mediate the functional interdependence of the c-fos SIE and SRE elements . In addition , the ras pathway is required for P78347 to exert its effects on the c-fos promoter , and growth factor stimulation enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of P78347 . These results indicate that P78347 is involved in signal transduction as well as transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter .
