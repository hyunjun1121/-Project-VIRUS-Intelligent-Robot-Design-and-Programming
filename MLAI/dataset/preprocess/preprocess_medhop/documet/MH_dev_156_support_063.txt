Effects of inhalational anesthetics on alpha2-adrenergic signaling in isolated platelets . ( 1 ) The hypothesis that inhalational anesthetics affect G-protein linked alpha2 adrenergic signaling pathway was investigated using human platelets as a model system . ( 2 ) Alpha2 receptor stimulation by UK-14304 , a potent and selective agonist , inhibits DB02527 production induced by prostaglandin I2 ( DB01240 ) . ( 3 ) Brief stimulation ( 30 s ) with DB01240 raised DB02527 levels in platelets by 25-fold ; UK-14304 suppressed the DB01240 stimulus by 80 % . ( 4 ) Halothane at fractional minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) through super physiological levels ( 16 MAC ) had no effect on basal or prostacyclin stimulated levels of DB02527 , nor did it have any effect on the inhibition of DB02527 production by UK-14304 . Moreover , isoflurane , enflurane and sevoflurane had no significant effect on DB02527 production at 1.5 or 8 MAC . The results suggest alpha2 and DB01240 signaling pathways are not sensitive to volatile anesthetics including the alpha2 or P43119 /G-protein complex , G-protein/adenylyl cyclase complex and adenylyl cyclase itself . ( 5 ) The possibility that halothane and related anesthetics act more distally in the pathway , on DB02527 -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) , was investigated by measuring the phosphorylation pattern of endogenous platelet proteins by PKA . ( 6 ) An increase in the [32P]phosphate incorporation was observed in platelets exposed to either , low doses of DB01240 or isobutylmethylxanthine ( DB07954 ) . Halothane , isoflurane , enflurane or sevoflurane further increased the level of [ 32P ] -incorporation . The apparent increase in PKA activity suggests that at least in platelets , volatile anesthetics activate PKA-dependent pathways which should antagonize alpha2 adrenergic signaling .
