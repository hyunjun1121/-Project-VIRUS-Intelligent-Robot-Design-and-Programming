P15692 activates receptor-operated cation channels in human microvascular endothelial cells . OBJECTIVE : Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) exerts many of its effects by stimulating endothelial calcium influx , but little is known about channels mediating P15692 -induced cation entry . The aim of this study was to measure and characterize for the first time the P15692 -activated cation current in human microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVECs ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from HMVECs . During applied voltage ramps , P15692 activated a current that reversed at 0 mV , was sensitive to gadolinium , and required extracellular cations . Noise analysis yielded a single-channel conductance of 27 pS . The current was not dependent on intracellular calcium stores , and was not blocked by inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) receptor or serine/threonine kinase inhibition but was partially inhibited by flufenamic acid . A similar current was activated by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol ( OAG ) , a membrane-permeant analog of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . To determine whether P15692 could activate recombinant ion channels with similar properties , we investigated the effect of P15692 on Chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with P35968 and the canonical transient receptor potential ( TRPC ) channels , Q13507 or Q9Y210 . P15692 induced a similar current to that described above in P35968 - Q13507 and P35968 - Q9Y210 cells but not in cells transfected with either cDNA alone . CONCLUSIONS : P15692 activates a receptor-operated cation current in HMVECs and OAG can activate directly a similar current in these cells . P15692 is also able to activate heterologously expressed Q13507 /6 channels through P35968 .
