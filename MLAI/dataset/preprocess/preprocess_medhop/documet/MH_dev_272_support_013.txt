Distribution patterns of cannabinoid P21554 receptors in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double transgenic mice . Cannabinoids have neuroprotective effects that are exerted primarily through cannabinoid P21554 receptors in the brain . This study characterized P21554 receptor distribution in the double transgenic ( dtg ) P05067 (swe)/ P49768 (ΔE9) mouse model for Alzheimer 's disease . Immunohistochemical labeling of P21554 protein in non-transgenic mice revealed that P21554 was highly expressed in the hippocampus , with the greatest density of P21554 protein observed in the combined hippocampal subregions P00918 and P07451 ( P00918 /3 ) . P21554 immunoreactivity in the P00915 and P00918 /3 hippocampal regions was significantly decreased in the dtg P05067 (swe)/ P49768 (ΔE9) mice compared to non-transgenic littermates . Reduced P21554 expression in dtg P05067 (swe)/ P49768 (ΔE9) mice was associated with astroglial proliferation and elevated expression of the cytokines inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor alpha . This finding suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of cannabinoids that is mediated by P21554 receptor , particularly in the P00918 /3 region of the hippocampus . Furthermore , the study suggests a decreased P21554 receptor expression may result in diminished anti-inflammatory processes , exacerbating the neuropathology associated with Alzheimer 's disease .
