P00747 activators , venous leg ulcers and reepithelialization . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The pathogenesis of leg ulcers due to chronic venous hypertension ( CVH ) seems to be related to perivenular fibrin-film formation due to decreased cutaneous fibrinolytic activity dependent on reduced release of tissue-type plasminogen activator that leads to tissue anoxia and ulcer formation . The purpose of the work is a spectrophotometric evaluation of urokinase ( Q96NZ9 ) at the edge , the floor and in the periulcerous skin of leg ulcers . METHODS : We examined a group of 10 patients with chronic leg ulcers caused by CVH . The biopsies from each patient were taken : ( 1 ) from the edge of the ulcer ; ( 2 ) from the perilesional skin and ( 3 ) from the floor of the ulcer . DB00013 levels were evaluated in the same areas in 10 control subjects . The Q96NZ9 activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm . RESULTS : The results of our study showed that Q96NZ9 is detectable in the center of the ulcer , on the edge , in the perilesional skin , as well as in the controls . Data are statistically significant . The highest levels of Q96NZ9 are found at the edge of the ulcer ; they were lower in the center and in the periulcerous skin . CONCLUSION : A chemoattracting effect of Q96NZ9 on human keratinocytes has been documented and this study showed significantly higher levels of Q96NZ9 at the edge and on the floor of the ulcers , suggesting a possible role of an Q96NZ9 gradient that could promote mobilization of keratinocytes from the edge to the floor , thus inducing reepithelialization . Moreover , Q96NZ9 could play some role in neoangiogenesis and fibroblast chemoattraction , thus contributing in various ways to wound healing .
