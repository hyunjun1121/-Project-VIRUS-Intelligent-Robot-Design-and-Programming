Differential expression of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin during monocytic differentiation . Macrophages generate reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) as the effectors of anti-bacterial defense mechanism . Intracellular ROIs and reduction/oxidation ( redox ) status play crucial roles in signal transduction . We therefore investigated the expression of redox-regulating proteins such as glutaredoxin ( P35754 ) and thioredoxin ( TRX ) during the differentiation of murine monocytic leukemia cell line M1 cells and human monocytic leukemia cell line U937 cells . When M1 cells were treated by P05231 , P35754 mRNA markedly increased and TRX mRNA also increased slightly . In contrast , there was no increase of P35754 mRNA in D-cell , which is a sub-cell line derived from M1 lacking in the capacity of differentiation . P35754 mRNA also increased in U937 cells differentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) . By immunohistochemistry , unstimulated M1 cells showed strong staining of TRX and marginal staining of P35754 . In contrast , TRX expression in P05231 treated M1 cells is as strong as in unstimulated M1 cells , whereas P35754 expression is slightly enhanced in P05231 treated M1 cells . Phagocytosis is markedly enhanced and hydrogen peroxide production is slightly enhanced in P05231 treated M1 cells . These results showed that TRX is steadily expressed whereas P35754 is induced in association with the differentiation in macrophage-like cell line cells , suggesting differential roles of these redox regulators in macrophage lineage .
