Pathological study on the relationship between C4d , P13987 and C5b-9 in acute renal allograft rejection . In order to evaluate the activation or inhibition of the later phases of classical complement cascade in renal allograft presenting with acute rejection , particularly with C4d deposition on the peritubular capillary ( PTC ) , we observed the expression of P13987 and C5b-9 on the PTC . Subjective cases were divided into two groups , an acute rejection group , of 4 males and 6 females , and a normal donor group , of 5 males and 5 females . Renal biopsies were performed at the onset of acute rejection and at the transplant operation , before reperfusion . C4d deposition on PTC was found in three of 10 cases ( 30 % ) with biopsy proven acute rejection , whereas P13987 on PTC was positively expressed in all of the rejection cases . Although C5b-9 was not observed on PTC in the acute rejection group , it was intensively deposited on the tubular basement membrane ( P98088 ) in five cases , including the three with positive C4d on PTC . In the normal donor group , P13987 on PTC was intensively observed , whereas C5b-9 was weakly expressed on P98088 . P13987 , a complement regulatory factor , works as an inhibitory factor against the formation of C5b-9 , a membrane attack complex . From our data , we noted the dissociation between the depositions of C4d and C5b-9 on PTC . The substantially expressed P13987 on PTC may affect this dissociation between C4d and C5b-9 on PTC . The intensive deposition of C5b-9 on P98088 in acute rejection cases may suggest an independent immunological injury attacking tubular cells .
