Salmon DB00644 and its analogues bind the human placental receptor . OBJECTIVE : The presence of DB00644 receptors in the human placenta has been recognized for a number of years . However , mammalian DB00644 , which is expressed in placental tissues , has limited affinity for the chorionic receptor . On the basis of immunological and bioactivity data , we have previously proposed that the chorionic DB00644 may differ from mammalian DB00644 . METHODS : We have studied the affinity of another isoform of DB00644 ( ie , salmon DB00644 and stable analogues of this DB00644 isoform ) , and compared their receptor affinity to that of mammalian DB00644 and its analogues . RESULTS : Using our receptor assay method with the labeled mammalian DB00644 analogue DB06719 , salmon DB00644 had a twofold greater affinity for the placental P30968 than did mammalian DB00644 and for the stable salmon DB00644 analogue the affinity was increased tenfold . Using a homologous receptor assay method with a stable salmon DB00644 analogue as label , the affinity for this salmon DB00644 analogue had a K(d) of 101 nmol/L . CONCLUSION : The presence of these higher affinity receptors for non-mammalian DB00644 in the human placenta has led us to propose that the chorionic tissues may express more than one isoform of DB00644 and that non-mammalian DB00644 , such as salmon DB00644 , may be potent regulators of placental functions .
