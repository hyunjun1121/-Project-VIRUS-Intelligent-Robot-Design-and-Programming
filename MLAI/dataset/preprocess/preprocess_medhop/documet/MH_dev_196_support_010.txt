Ocular pharmacokinetics of a single dose of bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1 % in human aqueous humor . PURPOSE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the ocular pharmacokinetics of a single dose of bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1 % in subjects undergoing routine cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation . METHODS : An open-label , phase II confirmatory study of 54 subjects undergoing cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation . A single drop of bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1 % was administered at 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , or 240 min prior to the initiation of cataract surgery . Samples of aqueous humor were aspirated through a paracentesis and analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography . Based upon these data , predicted concentrations of bromfenac in the aqueous humor over 24 h were generated by using computer simulation and compared with the IC(50) for bromfenac as a measure of anti-inflammatory efficacy . RESULTS : Peak aqueous-humor concentrations of bromfenac occurred between 150 and 180 min following ophthalmic dosing , with a mean concentration of 78.7 ng/mL . The level of bromfenac decreased in a log-linear fashion with an elimination-rate constant of 1.4 . DB00963 remained above the IC(50) value of cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) during the evaluated time points and over the 12-h dosing interval , using a computer model of extrapolated time points and assuming first-order elimination . CONCLUSIONS : Pharmacokinetic modeling , based upon samples collected over 240 min after a single dose of bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1 % suggests that aqueous-humor concentrations remain at clinically effective levels ( above its IC(50) value for P35354 ) for over 12 h . Based upon this rationale , these results supported clinical trials that demonstrated the efficacy of twice-daily dosing of bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1 % to manage patients with postoperative ocular pain and inflammation .
