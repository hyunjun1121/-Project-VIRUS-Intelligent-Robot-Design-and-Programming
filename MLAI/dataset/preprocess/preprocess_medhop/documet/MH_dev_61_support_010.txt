DB03404 upregulates Egr-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells via reactive oxygen species P27361 /2-Elk-1 and NF-kappaB . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and oxidant stress are important mediators of cardiovascular pathologies including atherosclerosis . One source of ROS in the vasculature is free heme released from hemoglobin . Because Egr-1 , the regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis , is also induced by oxidant stress and is likewise implicated in atherosclerosis , we examined the regulation of Egr-1 by heme in vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) . DB03404 increased Egr-1 expression ( mRNA , protein ) within 30 minutes and P27361 /2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation within 5 minutes . Inhibiting hemin-induced P27361 /2 activation by U0126 ( MAPK-inhibitor ) , the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine , the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium chloride , the superoxide scavenger tiron , or tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II)-dimer ( carbon-monoxide donor ; CORM-2 ) blocked hemin-induced Egr-1 expression . DB03404 activated Elk-1 , P11831 , and NF-kappaB and promoted their interaction with the Egr-1 promoter . Downregulating Elk-1 ( via siRNA ) or blocking NF-kappaB activation ( via BAY-11-7082 ) abolished hemin induction of Egr-1 . Finally , hemin-induced Egr-1 bound the promoters of tissue factor ( TF ) , P00747 Activator Inhibitor ( P05121 ) -1 , and P01138 -1A Binding ( NAB ) -2 , upregulating their expression , and increased the biochemical activity of TF and P05121 . Upregulation of Egr-1 and its target genes by heme-induced oxidant stress may be an important event in the initiation and progression of inflammatory vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis .
