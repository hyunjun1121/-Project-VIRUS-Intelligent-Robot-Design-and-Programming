UTP induces osteopontin expression through a coordinate action of NFkappaB , activator protein-1 , and upstream stimulatory factor in arterial smooth muscle cells . P10451 ( P10451 ) is an important chemokinetic agent for several cell types . Our earlier studies have shown that its expression is essential for uridine triphosphate ( UTP ) -mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells . We demonstrated previously that the activation of an AP-1 binding site located 76 bp upstream of the transcription start in the rat P10451 promoter is involved in the induction of P10451 expression . In this work , using a luciferase promoter deletion assay , we identified a new region of the rat P10451 promoter ( -1837 to -1757 ) that is responsive to UTP . This region contains an NFkappaB site located at -1800 and an Ebox located at -1768 . Supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified NFkappaB and P22415 -1/ P22415 -2 as the DNA binding proteins induced by UTP , respectively , for these two sites . Using dominant negative mutants of O15111 and P22415 transcription factors , we confirmed that NFkappaB and P22415 -1/ P22415 -2 are involved in the UTP-mediated expression of P10451 . Using a pharmacological approach , we demonstrated that P22415 proteins are regulated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 )1/2 pathway , just as the earlier discovered AP-1 complex , whereas NFkappaB is up-regulated through PKCdelta signals . Finally , our work suggests that the UTP-stimulated P10451 expression involves a coordinate regulation of PKCdelta-NFkappaB , P27361 /2- P22415 , and P27361 /2/NAD(P)H oxidase AP-1 signaling pathways .
