A human seminoma xenograft model with regional lymph node metastasis . PURPOSE : To establish a seminoma orthotopic model with lymph node metastasis to investigate the factors related to the lymphophilic behavior of seminoma cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testicular seminoma xenografts were established by the inoculation of small fragments from subcutaneous ( s.c. ) xenografts that had previously been established in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice with a supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a human seminoma . Hematologic dissemination of tumor cells was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification of the human beta-globin gene . Xenograft messenger RNA levels of metastasis-related genes were examined by reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR . RESULTS : Testicular seminoma xenografts grew in 32/32 ( 100 % ) of the inoculated mice , of which 15 mice ( 47 % ) developed macroscopic metastasis to the renal hilar lymph node . Circulating tumor cells and tumor cell shedding in the lung and liver were detectable by PCR assay in 25/32 ( 78 % ) , 32/32 ( 100 % ) , and 27/32 ( 84 % ) mice , respectively , although metastatic foci were not histologically evident in these organs . Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( P08253 ) , membrane-type 3 matrix metalloproteinase ( P51512 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) , and reduction in expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 ( P05120 ) were demonstrated by RT-PCR assay in the testicular xenografts as compared with the s.c. xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : This model mimics the lymphophilic behavior of seminoma and may help in elucidating the molecular mechanism of tumor spread via the lymphatics .
