Design , synthesis , and X-ray crystal structures of 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines as multireceptor tyrosine kinase and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors . To optimize dual receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibition , the E- and Z-isomers of 5-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl]furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamines ( 1a and 1b ) were separated by HPLC and the X-ray crystal structures ( 2.0 and 1.4A , respectively ) with mouse P00374 and NADPH as well as 1b with human P00374 ( 1.5A ) were determined . The E- and Z-isomers adopt different binding modes when bound to mouse P00374 . A series of 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines 2-13 were designed and synthesized using the X-ray crystal structures of 1a and 1b with P00374 to increase their P00374 inhibitory activity . Wittig reactions of appropriate 2-methoxyphenyl ketones with 2,4-diamino-6-chloromethyl furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine afforded the Q99618 - P02748 unsaturated compounds 2-7 and catalytic reduction gave the saturated 8-13 . Homologation of the P02748 -methyl analog maintains P00374 inhibitory activity . In addition , inhibition of P00533 and P09619 were discovered for saturated P02748 -homologated analogs 9 and 10 that were absent in the saturated P02748 -methyl analogs .
