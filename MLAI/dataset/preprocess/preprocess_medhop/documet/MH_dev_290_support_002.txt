Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibition prevents eosinophil recruitment by modulating Th2 cytokines in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation : a potential specific effect on P05113 . We recently used a murine model of allergic airway inflammation to show that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma-related lung inflammation . In this study , we show that P09874 inhibition , by a novel inhibitor ( TIQ-A ) or by gene deletion , prevented eosinophilic infiltration into the airways of OVA-challenged mice . Such impairment of eosinophil recruitment appeared to take place after IgE production . OVA challenge of wild-type mice resulted in a significant increase in P05112 , P05113 , P22301 , P35225 , and GM- P04141 secretions . Although P05112 production was moderately affected in OVA-challenged P09874 (-/-) mice , the production of P05113 , P22301 , P35225 , and GM- P04141 was completely inhibited in ex vivo OVA-challenged lung cells derived from these animals . A single TIQ-A injection before OVA challenge in wild-type mice mimicked the latter effects . The marked effect P09874 inhibition exerted on mucus production corroborated the effects observed on the Th2 response . Although P09874 inhibition by gene knockout increased the production of the Th1 cytokines P60568 and IL-12 , the inhibition by TIQ-A exerted no effect on these two cytokines . The failure of lung cells derived from OVA-challenged P09874 (-/-) mice to synthesize GM- P04141 , a key cytokine in eosinophil recruitment , was reestablished by replenishment of P05113 . Furthermore , intranasal administration of P05113 restored the impairment of eosinophil recruitment and mucus production in OVA-challenged P09874 (-/-) mice . The replenishment of either P05112 or IgE , however , did not result in such phenotype reversals . Altogether , these results suggest that P09874 plays a critical role in eosinophil recruitment by specifically regulating the cascade leading to P05113 production .
