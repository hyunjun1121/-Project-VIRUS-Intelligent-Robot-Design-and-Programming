Regulation of P14061 and P18405 in lymphocytes . We previously reported lymphocyte expression of genes encoding enzymes required for steroid metabolism ; however , only 17beta-HSD and 5alpha-reductase showed significant enzyme activity . We now investigate regulation of lymphocyte expression for genes encoding 17beta-HSD and 5alpha-reductase . Cultured human T and B lymphoid cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with known regulators of steroidogenic gene expression including forskolin , PMA , ionomycin , various steroids , interleukin ( IL ) -4 , and P05231 . Treatment with 10 or 50 microM forskolin resulted in a 20-60 % reduction of expression for P14061 ( encoding 17beta-HSD I ) in T and B lymphoid cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells , although such a change was not observed in the expression of P18405 ( encoding 5alpha-reductase I ) . No significant changes were found when cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of PMA or ionomycin . Incubation with 10(-9) to 10(-7) M androstenedione or estradiol increased expression of P14061 , while testosterone decreased the expression of this gene . P18405 expression was increased in the presence of 5alpha- DB02901 although no consistent changes were observed when the cells were treated with testosterone . Other steroids , including dexamethasone , progesterone , and 6-hydroxypregnanolone , produced no effects on expression of either P14061 or P18405 . Treatment with 0.1-10 ng/ml of P05112 or P05231 also did not effect significant changes in gene expression . These data implicate the involvement of the DB02527 -protein kinase signal transduction pathway in regulating lymphocyte expression of P14061 . Furthermore , it appears that lymphocyte P14061 and P18405 are regulated to some extent by specific steroids .
