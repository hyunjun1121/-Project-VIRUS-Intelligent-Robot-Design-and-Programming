Modulation of proinflammatory cytokine production in tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) -transgenic mice by treatment with cells engineered to secrete P05112 , P22301 or P35225 . P01375 is one of the major proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory joint disease , in human rheumatoid arthritis as well as in murine models of this disease . It was previously described that a highly destructive chronic spontaneous inflammatory arthritis develops in mice expressing a human P01375 transgene modified with the 3' untranslated region of beta-globin . The present study investigates in this mouse model the effects of the anti-inflammatory cytokines P05112 , P22301 and P35225 administered in vivo on proinflammatory cytokine expression . Groups of P01375 -transgenic mice were engrafted with xenogeneic transfected Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) fibroblasts secreting murine P05112 , P22301 or P35225 . In vivo treatments consisted of 3 or 4 weekly engraftments , starting when the mice were 4weeks old . Control groups of transgenic mice were engrafted with beta-galactosidase gene-transfected CHO cells or injected with medium . A significant decreased expression of P01375 transgene , endogenous mouse P01375 and IL-1 mRNA was observed in splenocytes of mice treated for 3 or 4 weeks with CHO/ P05112 and CHO/ P35225 , and , to a lesser extent , with CHO/ P22301 , compared with controls . Finally , attenuation of histological scores of arthritides was statistically significant only in the group of CHO/ P05112 -treated mice after 3weeks of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , and was not significant in any other group . These results show that P05112 , P22301 or P35225 , administered by gene therapy , can decrease the mRNA steady state levels of both endogenous and transgenic cytokines in human P01375 transgenic mice . In addition , P05112 can slightly attenuate the development of arthritides in this model .
