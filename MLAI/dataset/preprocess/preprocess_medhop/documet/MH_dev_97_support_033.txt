Prognostic significance of loss of heterozygosity at loci on chromosome 17p13.3-ter in sporadic breast cancer is evidence for a putative tumour suppressor gene . Several studies indicate that the short arm of chromosome 17 is one of the most frequently altered regions in sporadic breast carcinomas ( 45-60 % ) . In the present report the 17p13.3-ter locus in tumour DNA of breast cancer patients , along with their matching normal lymphocyte DNA , have been mapped with four markers ( D17S5 , D17S379 , Q12979 and D17S34 ) , spanning nearly 3 cM of the telomer . Sixty-five of 143 heterozygous tumours had lost at least one of the markers at the minimum region of loss ( 45 % ) . High levels of loss of these distal markers on 17p13.3 are independent of P04637 mutations and are associated with tumour cell proliferation . A follow-up period of over 7 years demonstrates that loss of these markers correlates both with disease-free ( P = 0.004 ) and overall survival ( P = 0.007 ) . In addition we show that for disease-free survival the prognostic power of this genetic alteration is second only to axillary lymph node involvement ( 3.1 vs 6.3 relative risk ) , and is a better predictor than the mutational status of P04637 ( 1.6 relative risk ) . Our results are further evidence of the presence , within the region , of at least a second tumour suppressor gene distal to P04637 , that might be targeted by deletions .
