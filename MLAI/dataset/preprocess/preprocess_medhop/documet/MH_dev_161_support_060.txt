P52333 inhibition significantly attenuates psoriasiform skin inflammation in P05107 mutant PL/J mice . P52333 , a member of the Janus kinase family , is predominantly expressed in hemopoietic cells and binds specifically to the common gamma chain of a subfamily of cytokine receptors that includes P60568 , P05112 , P13232 , P15248 , P40933 , and Q9HBE4 . Previous studies suggest that this tyrosine kinase plays key roles in mediating T cell functions , and inhibition of P52333 has been shown to prevent graft rejection and decrease the severity of arthritis in rodent models . However , the functions of P52333 in the development of skin immune responses and diseases such as psoriasis have not been determined . P05107 mutant PL/J mice develop spontaneous T cell-dependent psoriasiform skin disease with several similarities to human psoriasis . In this study , we treated mice with established skin disease with R348 , a small molecule inhibitor of P52333 , and observed a marked attenuation of skin lesions following 6 wk of treatment . Histological analyses revealed major reductions of both epidermal and dermal lesion severity scores in R348-treated P05107 -deficient PL/J mice compared with vehicle controls , which was associated with decreased P01730 (+) T cell infiltration . In addition , systemic levels of Q16552 , Q9GZX6 , IL-23 , and P01375 were significantly lower in mice receiving the compound , and T cells isolated from R348-treated mice also showed reduced phosphorylation of Stat5 after stimulation with P60568 . These findings suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of P52333 may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and strongly implicate JAK signaling events as important in the pathogenesis of this disease .
