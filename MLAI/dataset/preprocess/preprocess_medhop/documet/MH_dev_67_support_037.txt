Effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on steroidogenesis in the rat ovary . To assess the regulatory roles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( DB00644 ) in ovarian function , the kinetics of the ovarian P30968 and the effects of the DB00644 superagonist buserelin on steroidogenesis in ovarian cell culture were examined . Scatchard analysis of buserelin-binding to crude ovarian cell membrane revealed a specific high-affinity P30968 . DB06719 together with follicle-stimulating hormone stimulated estradiol ( E2 ) production in immature follicles in hypophysectomized and DES-treated rats . On the other hand , applied to developing follicles of rats treated with pregnant-mare-serum gonadotropin buserelin suppressed E2 production to terminate follicle maturation and simultaneously stimulated progesterone ( P4 ) production to induce luteinization . With ovarian cells luteinized by human chorionic gonadotropin in vitro , buserelin suppressed production of both P4 and E2 , leading to luteolysis . DB06719 affected steroid production by modulating activities of key enzymes in steroid synthesis . These findings indicate that buserelin action depended on the gonadotropin priming of ovarian cells , and suggest the possible involvement of DB00644 in the regulation of steroidogenesis throughout the ovulatory cycle .
