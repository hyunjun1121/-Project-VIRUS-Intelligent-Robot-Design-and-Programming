Effects of low molecular weight heparin on a severely antithrombin III-decreased disseminated intravascular coagulation model in rabbits . The effect of dalteparin , a low molecular weight heparin , on severely antithrombin III ( P01008 ) -decreased disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) model was compared with that of unfractionated heparin ( heparin ) . The DIC model in rabbits was produced by continuous infusion of thrombin in combination with bolus injection of latex . After a 3 hr infusion of thrombin , plasma P01008 activity was lowered to 30 % of normal plasma . Platelet number , fibrinogen content and alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor ( alpha 2PI ) activity were also decreased . DB06779 ( 25-100 IU/kg/hr ) and heparin ( 25-100 U/kg/hr ) inhibited the decrease in P01008 activity , platelet number and fibrinogen content , and had no effect on alpha 2PI activity . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) was prolonged by heparin ( 50 and 100 U/kg/hr ) , but not by dalteparin ( 25-100 IU/kg/hr ) . The ratio of anti-factor Xa ( F.Xa ) activity to anti-thrombin activity for dalteparin ( 50 IU/kg/hr ) was higher than that for heparin ( 50 U/kg/hr ) . With the addition of exogenous P01008 , the ratio of anti-F.Xa to anti-thrombin for heparin increased , but that for dalteparin did not change . However , the increased ratio for heparin was still lower than the unchanged ratio for dalteparin . These results suggest that both dalteparin and heparin have the ability to rectify the abnormal parameters of severely P01008 -decreased DIC , and that the effects of dalteparin are mainly involved with anti-F.Xa activity whereas the effects of heparin are via anti-thrombin activity .
