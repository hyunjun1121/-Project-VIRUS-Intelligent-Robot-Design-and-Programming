DB00107 and tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulate expression of prostaglandin E2 synthase and secretion of prostaglandin E2 by luminal epithelial cells of the porcine endometrium during early pregnancy . DB00107 ( P01178 ) and tumor necrosis factor α ( P01375 ) have been implicated in the control of luteolysis by stimulating endometrial secretion of luteolytic prostaglandin F(2α) ( P49763 (2α) ) . Nevertheless , P01178 concentration in porcine uterine lumen increases markedly on days 11-12 of pregnancy , and P01375 is expressed in endometrium during pregnancy . The objective of the study was to determine the effect of P01178 and P01375 on expression of the enzymes involved in PG synthesis : PG-endoperoxide synthase 2 ( P35354 ) , PGE(2) synthase ( mPGES-1 ) and P49763 synthase , and PGE(2) receptor ( PTGER2 ) , as well as on PG secretion by endometrial luminal epithelial cells ( LECs ) on days 11-12 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy . LECs isolated from gilts on days 11-12 of the estrous cycle ( n=8 ) and pregnancy ( n=7 ) were treated with P01178 ( 100 nmol/l ) and P01375 ( 0.6 nmol/l ) for 24 h . P01178 increased P35354 mRNA and mPGES-1 protein contents , as well as PGE(2) secretion but only on days 11-12 of pregnancy . P01375 stimulated P35354 and mPGES-1 mRNA , as well as mPGES-1 protein expression and PGE(2) release on days 11-12 of pregnancy and the estrous cycle . In addition , expressions of PTGER2 and P35408 were determined in corpus luteum ( CL ) . Abundance of PTGER2 mRNA and P35408 protein in CL was upregulated on day 14 of pregnancy versus day 14 of the estrous cycle . This study indicates that P01375 and P01178 regulate PGE(2) synthesis in LECs during early pregnancy . PGE(2) secreted by LECs , after reaching ovaries , could have a luteoprotective effect through luteal PTGER2 and P35408 , or may directly promote uterine function and conceptus development .
