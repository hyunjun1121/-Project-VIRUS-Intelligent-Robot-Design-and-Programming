Novel and emerging drugs for rarer chronic lymphoid leukaemias . Rarer chronic lymphoid leukaemias represent a challenge to the clinicians due to the limited information on their pathogenesis , difficulties on setting up prospective clinical trials and to their refractoriness to drugs used in the most common form of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) . In this review all these issues are addressed in three B-cell leukaemias : B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( B-PLL ) , hairy cell leukaemia ( HCL ) and HCL-variant and three T-cell leukaemias : T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) , T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia ( T-cell LGLL ) and adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma ( ATLL ) . Data will be presented on the natural history , current therapies and emerging drugs potentially useful in the treatment of patients with these leukaemias . Emphasis is made on : 1- the novel agents targeting a variety of B and T-cell antigens expressed on the surface of the leukaemic cells ; these are either unconjugated monoclonal antibodies ( McAb ) such as DB00073 ( anti- P11836 ) , the second and third generation of anti- P11836 McAbs , DB00087 ( anti- P31358 ) , Siplizumab ( anti- P06729 ) , DB00111 ( anti-CD25 ) and KW-0761 , an anti-chemokine receptor 4 ( CCR4 ) or McAbs conjugated to toxins such as P20273 linked to the pseudomonas exotoxin or radiolabelled McAb ; 2- the use of new purine nucleosides such as nelarabine and 3- agents targeting deregulated genes in the leukaemic cells from these diseases such as the Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) Olarapib in T-PLL with deregulation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( Q13315 ) gene . Data of phase I and II clinical studies with these agents as well as the potential and current use of other drugs are outlined .
