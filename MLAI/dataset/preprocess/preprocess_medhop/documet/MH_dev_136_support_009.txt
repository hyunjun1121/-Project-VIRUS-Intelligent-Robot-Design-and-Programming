The important roles of P07949 , P35968 and the RAF/MEK/ P29323 pathway in cancer treatment with sorafenib . AIM : To elucidate the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases P07949 and P35968 and the RAF/MEK/ P29323 signaling cascade in cancer treatment with sorafenib . METHODS : The cell lines A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 were tested . The enzyme activity was examined under cell-free conditions using 384-well microplate assays . Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Invitrogen Alarmar Blue assay . Gene expression was analyzed using the Invitrogen SYBR Green expression assays with a sequence detection system . Protein expression analysis was performed using Western blotting . RESULTS : DB00398 potently suppressed the activities of cRAF , P35968 , and P07949 with IC(50) values of 20.9 , 4 and 0.4 nmol/L , respectively . DB00398 inhibited cRAF , P35968 , and P07949 via non- DB00171 -competitive , DB00171 -competitive and mixed-type modes , respectively . In contrast , sorafenib exerted only moderate cytotoxic effects on the proliferation of the 3 cell lines . The IC(50) values for inhibition of A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 cells were 8572 , 4163 , and 8338 nmol/L , respectively . In the 3 cell lines , sorafenib suppressed the cell proliferation mainly by blocking the MEK/ P29323 downstream pathway at the posttranscriptional level , which in turn regulated related gene expression via a feed-back mechanism . CONCLUSION : This study provides novel evidence that protein kinases P07949 and P35968 play crucial roles in cancer treatment with sorafenib .
