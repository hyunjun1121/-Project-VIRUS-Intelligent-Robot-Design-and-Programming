New glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters . The L-type amino acid transporter Q01650 has recently been identified as being a disulfide-linked " light chain " of the ubiquitously expressed glycoprotein P08195 /CD98 . Several Q01650 -related transporters have been identified , which share the same putative 12-transmembrane segment topology and also associate with the single transmembrane domain P08195 protein . They display differing amino acid substrate specificities , transport kinetics and localizations such as , for instance , y(+) Q01650 which is localized at the basolateral membrane of transporting epithelia , and the defect of which causes lysinuric protein intolerance . The b(0,+)AT transporter which associates with the P08195 -related rBAT protein to form the luminal high-affinity diamino acid transporter defective in cystinuria , belongs to the same family of glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters ( gpaATs ) . These glycoprotein-associated transporters function as amino acid exchangers . They extend the specificity range of vectorial amino acid transport when located in the same membrane as carriers that unidirectionally transport one of the exchanged substrates . gpaATs belong to a phylogenetic cluster within the amino acid/polyamine/choline ( P25054 ) superfamily of transporters . This cluster , which we designate the O43561 family ( named after its first vertebrate member ) , includes some members from nematodes , yeast and bacteria . The latter of these proteins presumably lack association with a second subunit . In this review , we focus on the animal members of the O43561 cluster that form , together with some of the nematode members , the family of glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters ( gpaAT family ) .
