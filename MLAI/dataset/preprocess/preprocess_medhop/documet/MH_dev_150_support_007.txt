P10275 signalling in peritubular myoid cells is essential for normal differentiation and function of adult Leydig cells . DB00624 synthesis depends on normal Leydig cell ( LC ) development , but the mechanisms controlling this development remain unclear . We recently demonstrated that androgen receptor ( AR ) ablation from a proportion of testicular peritubular myoid cells ( PTM-ARKO ) did not affect LC number , but resulted in compensated LC failure . The current study extends these investigations , demonstrating that PTM AR signalling is important for normal development , ultrastructure and function of adult LCs . Notably , mRNAs for LC markers [ e.g. steroidogenic factor 1 ( Nr5a1 ) , insulin-like growth factor ( Igf-1 ) and insulin-like factor 3 ( Insl3 ) ] were significantly reduced in adult PTM-ARKOs , but not all LCs were similarly affected . Two LC sub-populations were identified , one apparently ' normal ' sub-population that expressed adult LC markers and steroidogenic enzymes as in controls , and another ' abnormal ' sub-population that had arrested development and only weakly expressed P51460 , luteinizing hormone receptor , and several steroidogenic enzymes . Furthermore , unlike ' normal ' LCs in PTM-ARKOs , the ' abnormal ' LCs did not involute as expected in response to exogenous testosterone . Differential function of these LC sub-populations is likely to mean that the ' normal ' LCs work harder to compensate for the ' abnormal ' LCs to maintain normal serum testosterone . These findings reveal new paracrine mechanisms underlying adult LC development , which can be further investigated using PTM-ARKOs .
