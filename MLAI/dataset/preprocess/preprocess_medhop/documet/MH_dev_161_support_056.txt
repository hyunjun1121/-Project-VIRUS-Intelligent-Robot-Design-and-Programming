Novel path to P05231 trans-signaling through thrombin-induced soluble P05231 receptor release by platelets . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 is a multifunctional cytokine with a critical role in inflammatory , immunoregulatory and haemopoietic responses . Its receptor consists of an ubiquitously expressed membrane transducing element ( P40189 ) and of the specific element P08887 ( P08887 ) , present only on hepatocytes and some leukocyte subsets . P08887 also exists as soluble protein ( sIL-6R ) that , in the presence of P05231 , forms a complex able to bind P40189 and , thanks to the mechanism called trans-signaling , transduces P05231 effect through tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the signal transducer and transcription activator ( P35610 ) -3 . The aim of this study was to analyze the bidirectional relationships between platelet aggregation and P05231 -dependent effects . While platelets do not produce P05231 , we found that resting platelets express P40189 , but not P08887 , on their membranes . Upon activation by thrombin or calcium ionophore A23187 , but not by ADP , the P08887 is released in soluble form , while cangrelor , the specific inhibitor of Q9H244 receptor , can partially inhibit sIL-6R release . This sIL-6R is biologically active and , in the presence of P05231 , can trigger P05231 trans-signaling , inducing an autocrine activation loop ( as measured by an increase in P08887 and P40189 content ) and P40763 phosphorylation . On the other hand , P05231 trans-signaling has no effect on platelet degranulation or aggregation by itself , nor on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation . Our data add an important piece to the puzzle of thrombosis and inflammation : in the presence of P05231 , which can be produced by stressed endothelial cells , the platelet-derived P05231 trans-signaling could be crucial for the evolution of inflammation within a damaged vessel .
