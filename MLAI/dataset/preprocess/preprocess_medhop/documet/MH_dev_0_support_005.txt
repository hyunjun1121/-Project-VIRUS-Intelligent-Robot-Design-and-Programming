P05231 and P10145 increase the expression of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of sialylated and/or sulfated Lewisx epitopes in the human bronchial mucosa . Bronchial mucins from patients suffering from CF ( cystic fibrosis ) exhibit glycosylation alterations , especially increased amounts of the sialyl-Lewis(x) ( NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4[Fucalpha1-3]GlcNAc-R ) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) ( NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4[Fucalpha1-3][SO(3)H-6]GlcNAc-R ) terminal structures . These epitopes are preferential receptors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the bacteria responsible for the chronicity of airway infection and involved in the morbidity and early death of CF patients . However , these glycosylation changes can not be directly linked to defects in P13569 ( CF transmembrane conductance regulator ) gene expression since cells that secrete airway mucins express no or very low amounts of the protein . Several studies have shown that inflammation may affect glycosylation and sulfation of various glycoproteins , including mucins . In the present study , we show that incubation of macroscopically healthy fragments of human bronchial mucosa with P05231 ( interleukin-6 ) or P10145 results in a significant increase in the expression of alpha1,3/4-fucosyltransferases [ Q495W5 ( fucosyltransferase 11 gene ) and P21217 ] , alpha2-6- and alpha2,3-sialyltransferases [ Q9Y274 ( alpha2,3-sialyltransferase 6 gene ) and Q96JF0 ( alpha2,6-sialyltransferase 2 gene ) ] and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases [ Q8NCG5 ( carbohydrate sulfotransferase 4 gene ) and Q9GZX3 ] mRNA . In parallel , the amounts of sialyl-Lewis(x) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) epitopes at the periphery of high-molecular-mass proteins , including Q99102 , were also increased . In conclusion , our results indicate that P05231 and -8 may contribute to the increased levels of sialyl-Lewis(x) and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis(x) epitopes on human airway mucins from patients with CF .
