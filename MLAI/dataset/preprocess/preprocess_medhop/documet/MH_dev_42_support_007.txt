Molecular mechanisms and modulation of key pathways underlying the synergistic interaction of sorafenib with erlotinib in non-small-cell-lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . Combination of drugs with different targets is a logical approach to overcome multilevel cross-stimulation among key pathways in NSCLC progression such as P00533 , K-Ras and VEGFR . The sorafenib-erlotinib combination showed clinical activity and acceptable safety . Therefore , we evaluated mechanisms underlying sorafenib-erlotinib interaction in seven NSCLC cell lines selected for their heterogeneous pattern of P00533 and Raf-kinase-inhibitor protein ( P30086 ) expression , and P00533 /K-Ras mutations . Pharmacologic interaction was studied using MTT/ P50991 assays and the combination index ( CI ) method , while effects on P00533 , Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation , cell cycle and apoptosis were studied with western-blot , ELISA , and flow cytometry . Intracellular drug concentrations were measured with LC-MS/MS , whereas kinase activity profiles were generated on tyrosine kinase peptide substrate arrays . Synergism was detected in all cell lines , with CIs < 0.6 in K-Ras mutated A549 , SW1573 and H460 , as well as in H1975 ( P00533 -T790M ) cells . DB00398 slowed cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis , which was significantly increased in the combination . Moreover , sorafenib reduced Akt/ P29323 phosphorylation in erlotinib-resistant cells , associated with significant P30086 up-regulation . No direct drug interaction was detected by LC-MS/MS measurement , while lysates from A549 and H1975 cells exposed to erlotinib+sorafenib showed a significant inhibition in the phosphorylation of 16 overlapping peptides , including sites from RAF , P35968 , P09619 , P24941 and P12931 , suggesting new markers to identify NSCLC patients who are likely to respond to this treatment . In conclusion , several mechanisms , including apoptosis-induction , modulation of expression/phosphorylation of P30086 and crucial kinases contribute to erlotinib-sorafenib synergistic interaction and should be evaluated in future trials for the rational development of this combination in NSCLC .
