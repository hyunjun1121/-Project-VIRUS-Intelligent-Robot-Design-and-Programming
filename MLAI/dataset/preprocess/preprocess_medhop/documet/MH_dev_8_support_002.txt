P00747 activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor gene expression in human saphenous vein organ culture . We describe the expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) in saphenous vein culture . Smooth muscle cells ( SMC ) are quiescent in fresh tissue , whereas these cells acquire a proliferating phenotype when venous segments are cultured in the presence of serum . t-PA and P05121 were localized immunohistochemically and quantified using biochemical techniques . t-PA and P05121 mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT -- PCR ) assay . Immunostaining showed an increase in the positivity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( P12004 ) from 10-day tissue culture . Tissue sections from fresh vein showed minimal t-PA and maximal P05121 immunostaining . In contrast , 10-day cultures showed an increase in t-PA and a decline in P05121 staining . Biochemical analysis revealed a 118 % increase in t-PA and a 50 % decrease in P05121 antigen levels from 10-day tissue cultures . RT -- PCR demonstrated that the mRNA encoding t-PA increased , while P05121 decreased after 10 days of culture . In conclusion , venous culture showed an up-regulation of t-PA and a repression of P05121 gene expression during SMC proliferation in the vessel wall . The P05121 repression observed in venous culture is in contrast to the situation observed in human atheroma . A shift in the t-PA/ P05121 balance may have a role in vascular remodeling .
