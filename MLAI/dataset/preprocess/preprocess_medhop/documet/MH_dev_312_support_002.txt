A protective role of hydrogen sulfide against oxidative stress in rat gastric mucosal epithelium . We investigated effect of hydrogen sulfide ( H(2)S ) on oxidative stress-caused cell death in gastric mucosal epithelial cells . In rat normal gastric epithelial RGM1 cells , NaHS , a H(2)S donor , at 1.5mM strongly suppressed hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) ) -caused cell death , while it slightly augmented the H(2)O(2) toxicity at 0.5-1mM . The protective effect of NaHS was abolished by inhibitors of MEK or JNK , but not of p38 Q96HU1 kinase . NaHS at 1.5mM actually phosphorylated P29323 and JNK in RGM1 cells . DB01016 , an DB00171 -sensitive K(+) ( K( DB00171 )(+) ) channel inhibitor , did not affect the protective effect of NaHS , although mRNAs for K( DB00171 )(+) channel subunits , Kir6.1 and Q09428 , were detected in RGM1 cells . In anesthetized rats , oral administration of NaHS protected against gastric mucosal lesion caused by ischemia-reperfusion . These results suggest that NaHS/H(2)S may protect gastric mucosal epithelial cells against oxidative stress through stimulation of Q96HU1 kinase pathways , a therapeutic dose range being very narrow .
