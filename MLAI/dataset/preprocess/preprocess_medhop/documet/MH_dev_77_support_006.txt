The destructive effect of botulinum neurotoxins on the SNARE protein : P60880 and synaptic membrane fusion . Synaptic exocytosis requires the assembly of syntaxin 1A and P60880 on the plasma membrane and synaptobrevin 2 ( P63027 ) on the vesicular membrane to bridge the two opposite membranes . It is believed that the three SNARE proteins assemble in steps along the dynamic assembly pathway . The C-terminus of P60880 is known to be the target of botulinum neurotoxins ( DB00083 and BoNT/E ) that block neurotransmitters release in vivo . In this study , we employed electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy to investigate the conformation of the P60880 C-terminus in binary and ternary SNARE complexes . The fluorescence lipid mixing assay shows that the C-terminal of P60880 is essential for membrane fusion , and that the truncated P60880 mutants cleaved by DB00083 and BoNT/E display different inhibition effects on membrane fusion : P60880 -25E ( Δ26 ) abolishes the fusion activity of the SNARE complex , while P60880 -25A ( Δ9 ) loses most of its function , although it can still form a SDS-resistant SNARE complex as the wild-type P60880 . CW-EPR spectra validate the unstable structures of the SNARE complex formed by P60880 mutants . We propose that the truncated P60880 mutants will disrupt the assembly of the SNARE core complex , and then inhibit the synaptic membrane fusion accordingly .
