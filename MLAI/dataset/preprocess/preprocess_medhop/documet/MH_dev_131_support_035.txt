Proteomic analysis identifies differentially expressed proteins in Q01196 / Q06455 acute myeloid leukemia cells treated with P26358 inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine . Azacitidine and decitabine are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemias . To further characterize different mechanisms between these two agents , cellular extracts from leukemic cells untreated or treated with either drug were analyzed using 2D electrophoresis . Numerous differentially expressed proteins were identified with MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS . P62937 , P04040 , P06748 and P12004 were decreased exclusively by azacitidine , P17987 and P22626 by both drugs ; alpha-Enolase and Q06830 by decitabine . Interestingly , the expression of the proinflammatory protein P62937 , also suggested as marker of cell necrosis , was stimulated by decitabine . Finally , a comprehensive pathway analysis of data highlighted a relationship between the identified proteins and potential effectors .
