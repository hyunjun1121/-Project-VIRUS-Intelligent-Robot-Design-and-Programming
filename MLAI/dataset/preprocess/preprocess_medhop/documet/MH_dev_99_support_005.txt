A Q96RJ3 mutation associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma alters TRAF recruitment and reveals new insights into Q96RJ3 signaling . The cytokine B cell activating factor ( Q9Y275 ) and its receptor , Q96RJ3 ( Q96RJ3 ) , modulate signaling cascades critical for B cell development and survival . We identified a novel mutation in Q96RJ3 , the gene encoding human Q96RJ3 , that is present in both tumor and germline tissue from a subset of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma . This mutation encodes a His159Tyr substitution in the cytoplasmic tail of Q96RJ3 adjacent to the Q13114 binding motif . Signaling through this mutant Q96RJ3 results in increased NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 activity and increased immunoglobulin production compared with the wild-type ( WT ) Q96RJ3 . This correlates with increased TRAF2 , Q13114 , and Q9Y4K3 recruitment to His159Tyr Q96RJ3 . In addition , we document a requirement for Q9Y4K3 in WT Q96RJ3 signaling . Together , these data identify a novel lymphoma-associated mutation in human Q96RJ3 that results in NF-κB activation and reveals Q9Y4K3 as a necessary component of normal Q96RJ3 signaling .
