Nursing perspectives on trastuzumab emtansine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer . Increased understanding of the molecular composition of breast cancer tumors has led to the development of targeted anticancer agents . Novel therapies directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) in breast cancer have been developed . One such agent , trastuzumab emtansine ( DB05773 ) , is an antibody drug conjugate that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of women with P04626 -positive breast cancer . Phase I and II studies have determined a maximum tolerated dose , and several phase Ib/II , II , and III studies have shown improved tolerability and efficacy compared with the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy . The most concerning grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with DB05773 include thrombocytopenia and transaminitis . To ensure that these adverse events do not delay or interrupt treatment , oncology nurses need to familiarize themselves with these risks and their management . This article reviews the clinical development of DB05773 and its usage , with a focus on the nurse 's role in preventing and managing adverse events associated with DB05773 therapy .
