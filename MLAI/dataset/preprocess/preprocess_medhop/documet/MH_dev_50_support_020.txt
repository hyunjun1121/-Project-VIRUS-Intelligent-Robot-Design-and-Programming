DB01098 , a new P04035 inhibitor , reduces the colonic inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice . The aim of the present study was to elucidate the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin , a new P04035 inhibitor , on colonic mucosal damage and on the inflammatory response in a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) colitis model . Acute colitis was induced using 8 % DSS in female BALB/c mice . Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated clinically , biochemically , and histologically . Mucosal protein contents and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha were determined by immunoassay and real time-PCR . The mRNA levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( P29474 ) were determined by real-time PCR . Disease activity scores in DSS-induced colitis model mice , as determined by weight loss , stool consistency , and blood in stool , were significantly lower in the rosuvastatin-treated mice than in control mice . Shortening of the colon was significantly reversed by rosuvastatin . Increases in tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances after DSS administration were both significantly inhibited by treatment with rosuvastatin . DB01098 also inhibited increases in intestinal P01375 protein and mRNA expression after DSS administration , respectively . The mucosal mRNA levels of P29474 were decreased after DSS administration , but preserved in mice treated with rosuvastatin . These results suggest that rosuvastatin prevents the development of DSS-induced colitis in mice via the inhibition of mucosal inflammatory responses associated with the preservation of P29474 transcription .
