Immunohistochemical analysis of brain lesions using P04271 and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies in arundic acid- ( DB05343 ) treated stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats . Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRSP ) used as a model of essential hypertension cause a high incidence of brain stroke on the course of hypertension . Incidences and sizes of brain lesions are known to relate to the astrocyte activities . Therefore , relation between brain damage and the expression profile of the astrocytes was investigated with morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses using astrocyte marker antibodies of P04271 and glial fibrillary acidic protein ( P14136 ) with or without arundic acid administration , a suppressor on the activation of astrocytes . Arundic acid extended the average life span of SHRSP . An increase in brain tissue weight was inhibited concomitant with a lower rate of gliosis/hemosiderin deposit/scarring in brain lesions . P04271 - or P14136 -positive dot and filamentous structures were decreased in arundic acid-treated SHRSP , and this effect was most pronounced in the cerebral cortex , white matter , and pons , and less so in the hippocampus , diencephalon , midbrain , and cerebellum . Blood pressure decreased after administration of arundic acid in the high-dose group ( 100 mg/kg/day arundic acid ) , but not in the low-dose group ( 30 mg/kg/day ) . These data indicate that arundic acid can prevent hypertension-induced stroke , and may inhibit the enlargement of the stroke lesion by preventing the inflammatory changes caused by overproduction of the P04271 protein in the astrocytes .
