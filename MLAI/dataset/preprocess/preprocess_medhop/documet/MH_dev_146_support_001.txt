Skeletal receptors for steroid-family regulating glycoprotein hormones : A multilevel , integrated physiological control system . Pituitary glycoprotein hormone receptors , including Q01718 , P16473 , and P23945 , occur in bone . Their skeletal expression reflects that central endocrine control is evolutionarily recent . DB01285 receptors , in osteoblasts or the adrenal cortex , drive P15692 synthesis . P15692 is essential to maintain vasculature . In bone , DB01285 suppression by glucocorticoids can cause osteonecrosis . DB00024 receptors occur on osteoblasts and osteoclasts , in both cases reducing activity . Thus , DB00024 directly reduces skeletal turnover , consistent with evolutionary adaptation to stress . DB00094 receptors accelerate bone resorption , whereas estrogen promotes bone formation , the forces usually balancing . With ovarian failure , low estrogen with high DB00094 causes rapid bone loss . The skeletal DB00094 effect in the menopause seems paradoxical , but it is a logical adaptation in lactation , where prolonged DB00094 elevation also occurs . In addition to receptors , there is some synthesis of pituitary glycoproteins at distributed sites ; this is not well studied , but it may further modify the paradigm of central endocrine regulation .
