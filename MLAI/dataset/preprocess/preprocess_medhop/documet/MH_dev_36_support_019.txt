Dopamine agonists upregulate P05231 and P10145 production in human keratinocytes . AIM : Catecholamines regulate functions of the nervous , neuroendocrine and immune systems . Dopamine may modulate the activity of keratinocytes , which play a role in secreting cytokines and chemokines . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic agonists on the production of P05231 and P10145 by a non-tumoral human keratinocyte cell line ( HaCaT ) . METHODS : Cells were stimulated with dopamine and the P14416 agonist cabergoline . Levels of P05231 and P10145 in culture supernatants were then determined . Cell proliferation was also assessed . Assays were carried out in the presence or absence of the dopaminergic and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists ( sulpiride and propranolol , respectively ) and ascorbic acid . RESULTS : Dopamine stimulated the production of P05231 and P10145 in a concentration-dependent manner . The effects observed on the secretion of P05231 were more potent than those corresponding to P10145 and were reduced by ascorbic acid . The dopamine-induced P05231 secretion was partially reduced by sulpiride and abrogated by propranolol . The latter drug was able to block the effect of dopamine on the secretion of P10145 . The cabergoline-induced P05231 release was reduced by sulpiride . Cell viability was not affected by any of the drugs . CONCLUSIONS : Dopaminergic agonists can stimulate keratinocytes to produce P05231 and P10145 which are related to inflammatory cutaneous processes . These effects are mediated by dopaminergic and β-adrenergic receptors and by receptor-independent oxidative mechanisms .
