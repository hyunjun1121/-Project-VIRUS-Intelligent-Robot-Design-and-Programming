Decreased synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase-7 and adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins of human colon cancer cells treated with troglitazone . PURPOSE : In the present study , we investigated the effect of troglitazone , a selective ligand and agonist of P37231 , on the metastatic potential of human colon cancer cells . METHODS : High- and low- P37231 expression clones of the colon cancer cell line , HT29 , namely clones 21 and 3 respectively , were used . We investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proliferation , on the adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and on the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) of colon cancer cells . RESULTS : DB00197 inhibited the proliferation of both subclones , in a dose-dependent manner , and the inhibitory effect correlated with the level of P37231 expression . DB00197 strongly inhibited the production of P09237 , an enzyme associated with invasiveness of cancer cells , by both subclones . In addition , troglitazone caused a strong decrease in the adhesion of clone 21 to extracellular matrix ( Q13201 ) proteins , laminin and type IV collagen . This effect was independent of beta1-integrins expression CONCLUSION : In addition to inhibition of cancer cell growth , troglitazone had an inhibitory effect on two important events associated with the metastatic potential of cancer cells , production of MMPs and adhesion to Q13201 proteins . Consequently , troglitazone is a promising agent for the treatment and prevention of colon cancer metastasis .
