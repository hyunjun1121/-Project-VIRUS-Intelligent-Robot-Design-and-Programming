Research Validity Scales for the NEO-PI-R : additional evidence for reliability and validity . We examined the reliability and validity of the research validity scales ( Schinka , Kinder , & Kremer , 1997 ) for the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised ( NEO-PI-R ) in a clinical sample . The Negative Presentation Management ( P06748 ) and Positive Presentation Management ( PPM ) scales were found to have satisfactory internal consistency reliability . Support for the validity of these scales was provided by the pattern of convergent and discriminant correlations with respective Personality Assessment Inventory ( P05121 ) validity scales . Finally , P05121 profiles of individuals with invalid P06748 scores were found to differ significantly from those with valid P06748 scores . Comparisons of the invalid profiles with profiles from other clinical samples provided additional support for the use of the P06748 scale as a measure of negative impression management .
