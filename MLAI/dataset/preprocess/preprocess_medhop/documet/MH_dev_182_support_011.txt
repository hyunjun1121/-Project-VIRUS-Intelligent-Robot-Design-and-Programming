Thromboxane A(2) generation , in the absence of platelet P23219 activity , in patients with and without atherothrombotic myocardial infarction . BACKGROUND : DB00945 's therapeutic action is via inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase 1 ( P23219 ) thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) production . The aim of this study was to evaluate TxA2 production , in the absence of platelet P23219 activity , in coronary atherosclerotic heart disease patients with and without atherothrombotic myocardial infarction ( MI ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : TxA2 production , in the absence of platelet P23219 activity , was evaluated in 44 patients taking aspirin on 3 commercially available assays that detect metabolites of TxA2 in the urine . Two assays measure urine 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 ( TxB2 ) alone and 1 measures urine 11-dehydro-TxB2 plus 11-dehydro-2,3-dinor-TxB2 . Platelet P23219 inhibition was confirmed on < 10 % platelet aggregation in response to â‰¥1 mmol/L arachidonic acid . Median urine 11-dehydro-TxB2 was no different in those with and without a diagnosis of atherothrombotic MI ( 325 vs. 311 pg/mg creatinine , P=0.59 via polyclonal ELISA ) and ( 312 vs. 244 pg/mg creatinine , P=0.11 via LC-MS/MS ) . Median urine 11-dehydro-TxB2 plus 11-dehydro-2,3-dinor-TxB2 , however , was higher in those with vs. those without a diagnosis of atherothrombotic MI ( 1,035 vs. 606 pg/mg creatinine , P=0.03 via monoclonal ELISA ) . CONCLUSIONS : Differences in TxA2 production , in the absence of platelet P23219 activity , between those with vs. without atherothrombotic MI were not observed when TxA2 generation was assessed on 11-dehydro-TxB2 production alone ( polyclonal ELISA or LC-MS/MS ) , but differences were observed when TxA2 generation was assessed using 11-dehydro-TxB2 plus 11-dehydro-2,3-dinor-TxB2 ( monoclonal ELISA ) . These findings highlight important differences between different commercially available assays for TxA2 generation and suggest that 11-dehydro-2,3-dinor-TxB2 may be critical to the biology of atherothrombosis .
