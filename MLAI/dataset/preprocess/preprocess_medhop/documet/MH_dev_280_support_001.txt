DB02426 effects on brown-fat mitochondria imply that the adenine nucleotide translocator isoforms P12235 and P05141 may be responsible for basal and fatty-acid-induced uncoupling respectively . In brown-fat mitochondria , fatty acids induce thermogenic uncoupling through activation of P25874 ( uncoupling protein 1 ) . However , even in brown-fat mitochondria from P25874 -/- mice , fatty-acid-induced uncoupling exists . In the present investigation , we used the inhibitor CAtr ( carboxyatractyloside ) to examine the involvement of the ANT ( adenine nucleotide translocator ) in the mediation of this P25874 -independent fatty-acid-induced uncoupling in brown-fat mitochondria . We found that the contribution of ANT to fatty-acid-induced uncoupling in P25874 -/- brown-fat mitochondria was minimal ( whereas it was responsible for nearly half the fatty-acid-induced uncoupling in liver mitochondria ) . As compared with liver mitochondria , brown-fat mitochondria exhibit a relatively high ( P25874 -independent ) basal respiration ( ' proton leak ' ) . Unexpectedly , a large fraction of this high basal respiration was sensitive to CAtr , whereas in liver mitochondria , basal respiration was CAtr-insensitive . Total ANT protein levels were similar in brown-fat mitochondria from wild-type mice and in liver mitochondria , but the level was increased in brown-fat mitochondria from P25874 -/- mice . However , in liver , only Ant2 mRNA was found , whereas in brown adipose tissue , Ant1 and Ant2 mRNA levels were equal . The data are therefore compatible with a tentative model in which the P05141 isoform mediates fatty-acid-induced uncoupling , whereas the P12235 isoform may mediate a significant part of the high basal proton leak in brown-fat mitochondria .
