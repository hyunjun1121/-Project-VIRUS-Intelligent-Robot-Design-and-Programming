Purinergic P47900 receptor signaling mediates wound stimuli-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts . Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts ( ISMFs ) are crucial for barrier formation against inflammatory stimuli . Physical injury induces cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) expression , which accelerates wound healing by ISMFs . However , the mechanism of P35354 induction remains unclear . Physically damaged cells release DB00171 . Here , we investigate the role of DB00171 -purinergic signaling in wound-induced P35354 induction in ISMFs . By 24h post-injury , bovine ISMFs had migrated to and closed the wounded area . A P36551 inhibitor , indomethacin or a purinergic P2 receptor antagonist , suramin , inhibited wound healing . However , additional treatment with indomethacin did not influence wound healing in suramin-treated ISMFs . RT-PCR showed an increase in P35354 mRNA expression 2h post-injury , which was inhibited by suramin . These results suggest that DB00171 mediates wound-induced P35354 elevation . We next assessed the contribution of various purinergic receptors in P35354 induction . An DB00171 analog , ATPγS and a purinergic P47900 , 11-13 receptors agonist , ADP , were among the agents tested which increased P35354 expression . ATPγS-induced P35354 mRNA expression was suppressed by suramin or a purinergic P2Xs , P47900 , 4 , 6 , and 13 receptors antagonist , PPADS . These data suggest the involvement of Gq-coupled purinergic P47900 receptor or Gi-coupled purinergic Q9BPV8 receptor in P35354 induction . U73122 , an inhibitor of phospholipase C , which is a downstream signal of Gq protein , showed suppression of P35354 mRNA expression . However , pertussis toxin , a Gi inhibitor , did not show suppression . We also revealed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK and PKC inhibited ATPγS-induced P35354 mRNA expression . Collectively , purinergic P47900 receptor signaling mediates wound-induced P35354 expression through p38 MAPK and PKC pathways in ISMFs .
