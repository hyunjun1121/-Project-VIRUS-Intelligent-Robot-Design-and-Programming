Additive antiemetic efficacy of low-doses of the cannabinoid CB(1/2) receptor agonist Δ(9)-THC with ultralow-doses of the vanilloid Q8NER1 receptor agonist resiniferatoxin in the least shrew ( Cryptotis parva ) . Previous studies have shown that cannabinoid P21554 /2 and vanilloid Q8NER1 agonists ( DB00470 ( Δ(9)-THC ) and resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) , respectively ) can attenuate the emetic effects of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin . In this study we used the least shrew to demonstrate whether combinations of varying doses of Δ(9)-THC with resiniferatoxin can produce additive antiemetic efficacy against cisplatin-induced vomiting . RTX by itself caused vomiting in a bell-shaped dose-dependent manner with maximal vomiting at 18 μg/kg when administered subcutaneously ( s.c. ) but not intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) . Δ(9)-THC up to 10 mg/kg provides only 80 % protection of least shrews from cisplatin-induced emesis with an ID50 of 0.3-1.8 mg/kg . Combinations of 1 or 5 μg/kg RTX with varying doses of Δ(9)-THC completely suppressed both the frequency and the percentage of shrews vomiting with ID50 dose values 5-50 times lower than Δ(9)-THC doses tested alone against cisplatin . A less potent Q8NER1 agonist , capsaicin , by itself did not cause emesis ( i.p. or s.c. ) , but it did significantly reduce vomiting induced by cisplatin given after 30 min but not at 2 h . The Q8NER1 -receptor antagonist , ruthenium red , attenuated cisplatin-induced emesis at 5mg/kg ; however , another Q8NER1 -receptor antagonist , capsazepine , did not . In summary , we present evidence that combination of P21554 /2 and Q8NER1 agonists have the capacity to completely abolish cisplatin-induced emesis at doses that are ineffective when used individually .
