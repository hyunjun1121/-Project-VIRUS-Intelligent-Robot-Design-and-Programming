[ DB00945 -- the prodigious panacea ? Molecular mechanisms of the action of acetylsalicylic acid in the organism ] . DB00945 ( acetylsalicylic acid ) is a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug capable of acetylating proteins in the course of a simple , non-enzymatic chemical reaction . Its main physiological effect is inhibiting prostanoid synthesis . Cyclooxygenases , P23219 and P35354 , are crucial in the metabolic pathway leading to the generation of prostanoids . Both enzymes are major cellular targets for aspirin . The physiological spectrum of the biological activity of the prostanoids is very broad , and underlies the high clinical effectiveness of aspirin as an anti-inflammatory , antipyretic , and analgesic drug . Apart from the inhibition of prostanoid synthesis aspirin shows a variety of pharmacological activities , including reduction of DB00171 storage pools , increased extracellular adenosine , lowered inducible nitric oxide synthase activity , modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , and the expression of a plethora of genes induced under conditions of cell stress via the regulation of transcription factor NFkappaB activity . Such multipotent action explains its wide use in clinical practice . Regardless of the accumulated evidence on the molecular mechanisms of aspirin 's action , the rationale of the appropriate dosing and monitoring of aspirin therapy and prophylaxis remains obscure . Hence , an evaluation and reasonable weighing of the cost/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy in various diseases seems appropriate .
