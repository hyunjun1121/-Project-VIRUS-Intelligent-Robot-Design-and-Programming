Receptor tyrosine kinase pathway analysis sheds light on similarities between clear-cell sarcoma and metastatic melanoma . To highlight possible similarities and differences in receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) and downstream signalling activation profiles between clear-cell sarcomas ( O14618 ) and metastatic melanomas ( MM ) , frozen , and paired-matched fixed samples of six O14618 with Q01844 rearrangement ( Q01844 + ) , five O14618 without Q01844 rearrangement ( Q01844 - ) , and seven MM were investigated by means of biochemical , immunohistochemical , Q5TCZ1 , molecular analyses , and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy . Fixed samples of a further 10 O14618 and 14 MM were investigated by means of sequencing for P15056 , P01111 , and P01116 mutations and Q5TCZ1 analyses for the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8 . RTK analysis of all O14618 /MM samples showed activation of short-form ( sf ) recepteur d'origine nantais ( Q04912 ) RTK and of P09619 , MET , and P21860 . Analysis of downstream signaling revealed consistent phosphorylation patterns of PI3K/AKT , RSK , and the P42345 targets S6 and 4EBP1 . Analysis of frozen and fixed material from 21 O14618 and 21 MM showed the presence of the V600E P15056 mutation in 2/12 Q01844 + and 3/9 Q01844 - O14618 and 9/21 MM and demonstrated a significant ( P < 0.001 ) correlation between the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8 and Q01844 - O14618 . Our results show that P15056 mutation can also be present in O14618 and support the proposed aberration of chromosomes 22 and 8 as a possibly useful nonrandom hallmark of Q01844 - O14618 . Besides , they broaden the spectrum of the similarities of RTK pathway activation between O14618 and MM , thus suggesting that new drugs found to be active in melanoma and Q04912 inhibitors could have a role in O14618 treatment .
