Immune reconstitution following rabbit antithymocyte globulin . Depletional induction therapies are routinely used to prevent acute rejection and improve transplant outcome . The effects of depleting agents on T-cell subsets and subsequent T-cell reconstitution are incompletely defined . We used flow cytometry to examine the effects of rabbit antithymocyte globulin ( DB00098 ) on the peripheral T-cell repertoire of pediatric and adult renal transplant recipients . We found that while DB00098 effectively depleted CD45RA+ P26842 + na√Øve and CD45RO+ P26842 + central memory P01730 + T cells , it had little effect on CD45RO+ P26842 - P01730 + effector memory or CD45RA+CD31- , CD45RO+ P26842 + and CD45RO+ P26842 - CD8+ T cell subsets . When we performed a kinetic analysis of CD31+ recent thymic emigrants and CD45RA+/RO+ T cells , we found evidence for both thymopoiesis and homeostatic proliferation contributing to immune reconstitution . We additionally examined the impact of DB00098 on peripheral P01730 +Foxp3+ T cells . We found that in adults , administration of DB00098 -induced peripheral expansion and new thymic emigration of T cells with a Treg phenotype , while P01730 +Foxp3+ T cells of thymic origin predominated in children , providing the first evidence that DB00098 induces Treg in vivo . Collectively our data indicate that DB00098 alters the balance of regulatory to memory effector T cells posttransplant , providing an explanation for how it positively impacts transplant outcome .
