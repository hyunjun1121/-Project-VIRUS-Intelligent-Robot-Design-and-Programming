Attenuation of LPS-induced lung inflammation by glucosamine in rats . Acute inflammation is often observed during acute lung injury ( ALI ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome . DB01296 is known to act as an anti-inflammatory molecule . The effects of glucosamine on acute lung inflammation and its associated mechanisms remain unclear . The present study sought to address how glucosamine plays an anti-inflammatory role in acute lung inflammation in vivo and in vitro . Using the LPS intratracheal instillation-elicited rat lung inflammation model , we found that glucosamine attenuated pulmonary edema and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration , as well as the production of P01375 -α , IL-1β , cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant ( CINC ) -1 , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) -2 , and nitric oxide ( NO ) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) and in the cultured medium of BALF cells . The expression of P01375 -α , IL-1β , IFN-γ , CINC-1 , MIP-2 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) in LPS-inflamed lung tissue was also suppressed by glucosamine . Using the rat alveolar epithelial cell line Q401N2 , we noted that the cytokine mixture (cytomix)-regulated production and mRNA expression of CINC-1 and MIP-2 , NO production , the protein and mRNA expression of P35228 , P35228 mRNA stability , and P35228 promoter activity were all inhibited by glucosamine . Furthermore , glucosamine reduced LPS-mediated NF-κB signaling by decreasing IκB phosphorylation , p65 nuclear translocation , and NF-κB reporter activity . Overexpression of the p65 subunit restored the inhibitory action of glucosamine on cytomix-regulated NO production and P35228 expression . In conclusion , glucosamine appears to act as an anti-inflammatory molecule in LPS-induced lung inflammation , at least in part by targeting the NF-κB signaling pathway .
