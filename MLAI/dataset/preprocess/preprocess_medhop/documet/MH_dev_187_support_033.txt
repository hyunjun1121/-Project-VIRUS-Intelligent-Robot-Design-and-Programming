Characterisation of the contractile activity of eletriptan at the canine vascular P28222 receptor . The functional activity of eletriptan ( ( R ) -3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-5- [ 2- ( phenylsulphonyl ) ethyl ] - 1 H-indole ) at the contractile serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT ) ' 1B-like ' receptor in dog isolated saphenous vein and basilar artery was investigated . DB00216 , like 5-HT and sumatriptan potently contracted saphenous vein ( pEC50 : 6.3 , 6.9 and 6.1 , respectively ) and basilar artery ( pEC50 7.2 , 7.5 and 6.8 , respectively ) . The maximum responses evoked by eletriptan was , unlike sumatriptan , significantly lower than that to 5-HT ( intrinsic activity saphenous vein : eletriptan 0.57 , 5-HT 1.0 , sumatriptan 0.85 ; basilar artery : eletriptan 0.77 , 5-HT 0.98 , sumatriptan 0.89 ) . Contractions evoked by eletriptan were antagonised by the P28222 /1D receptor antagonist GR125743 ( N- [ 4-methoxy-3- ( 4-methyl piperazin-1-yl ) phenyl ] -3-methyl-4-(4-pyridyl)benzamide ) with pA2 values of 9.1 in saphenous vein and 9.4 in basilar artery . Affinity estimates ( pKA ) for 5-HT and sumatriptan determined from receptor alkylation studies in saphenous vein were 6.6 and 6.3 , respectively , compared to the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant ( pKp ) for eletriptan of 6.8 . The rank order of relative intrinsic efficacies ( epsilon ) was 5-HT > sumatriptan > eletriptan . Thus , eletriptan required greater receptor occupancy ( 4.4-fold ) to evoke an equivalent contraction to 5-HT and sumatriptan in dog isolated saphenous vein . These data demonstrate that eletriptan is a potent partial agonist at the canine vascular P28222 receptor .
