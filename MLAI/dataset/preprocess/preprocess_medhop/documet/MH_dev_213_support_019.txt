Synthesis and biological activity of DB00644 antagonists modified at position 3 with 3-(2-methoxy-5-pyridyl)-alanine . DB06699 is a potent very long-acting DB00644 antagonist after subcutaneous administration . In this paper , we describe the synthesis of two analogs of degarelix incorporating racemic 3-(2-methoxy-5-pyridyl)-alanine ( 2-OMe-5Pal , 5 ) at position 3 . The two diastereomers were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ( RP-HPLC ) and the absolute stereochemistry at position 3 in the peptides was determined by enzymatic digestion with proteinase K . These analogs were tested in vitro for their ability to antagonize the P30968 and in vivo for duration of action in a castrated male rat assay . Analog 7 with D2-OMe-5Pal was potent in vitro ( IC50 = 5.22 nM ) ; however , analog 8 with Q401N2 -OMe-5Pal at position 3 in degarelix lost potency as an antagonist of the human P30968 ( IC50 = 36.95 nM ) . Both the analogs were found to be short-acting in vivo .
