Establishment by adriamycin exposure of multidrug-resistant rat ascites hepatoma AH130 cells showing low P15559 activity and high cross resistance to mitomycins . A resistant subline ( AH130/5A ) selected from rat hepatoma AH130 cells after exposure to adriamycin ( P35318 ) showed remarkable resistance to multiple antitumor drugs , including mitomycin C ( DB00305 ) and porfiromycin ( PFM ) . PFM , vinblastine ( DB00570 ) , and P35318 accumulated in AH130/5A far less than in the parent AH130 ( AH130/P ) cells . AH130/5A cells showed overexpression of P-glycoprotein ( A6NDG6 ) , an increase in glutathione S-transferase activity , and a decrease in P15559 and glutathione peroxidase activity . The resistance to DB00305 and DB00570 of AH130/5A cells was partly reversed by H-87 , an inhibitor of A6NDG6 . Buthionine sulfoximine , an inhibitor of glutathione synthase , did not affect the action of DB00305 . tert-Butylhydroquinone induced P15559 activity , increased PFM uptake , and enhanced the growth-inhibitory action of DB00305 in AH130/5A cells . DB00266 , an inhibitor of P15559 , decreased PFM uptake and reduced the growth-inhibitory action of DB00305 in AH130/P cells . These results indicated that the adriamycin treatment of hepatoma cells caused multifactorial multidrug resistance involving a decrease in P15559 activity .
