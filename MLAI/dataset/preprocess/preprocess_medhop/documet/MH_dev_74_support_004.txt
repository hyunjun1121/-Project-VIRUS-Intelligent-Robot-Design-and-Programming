Direct binding of recombinant plasminogen kringle 1-3 to angiogenin inhibits angiogenin-induced angiogenesis in the chick embryo P62158 . P03950 is one of the most potent angiogenesis-inducing proteins . Angiostatin is one of the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors , and it contains the first four kringle domains of plasminogen ( P04264 -4 ) . Recombinant human plasminogen kringle 1-3 ( rK1-3 ) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity . The binding of t-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid with the purified kringle 1-3 was determined by changes in intrinsic fluorescence . rK1-3 exhibits comparable ligand-binding properties as native human plasminogen kringle 1-3 . The purified rK1-3 inhibits neovascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) assay . Interaction of angiogenin with rK1-3 was examined by immunological binding assay and surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis , and the equilibrium dissociation constants for the complex , Kd , are 0.89 and 0.18 microM , respectively . rK1-3 inhibits angiogenin-induced angiogenesis in the chick embryo P62158 in a concentration-dependent manner . These results indicate that rK1-3 directly binds to angiogenin and thus rK1-3 inhibits the angiogenic activity of angiogenin .
