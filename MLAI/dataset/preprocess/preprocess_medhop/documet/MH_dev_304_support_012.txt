Selective antitumor activity of ibrutinib in P00533 -mutant non-small cell lung cancer cells . DB09053 , which irreversibly inhibits Q06187 , was evaluated for antitumor activity in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines and found to selectively inhibit growth of NSCLC cells carrying mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) gene , including T790M mutant and erlotinib-resistant H1975 cells . DB09053 induced dose-dependent inhibition of phosphor- P00533 at both Y1068 and Y1173 sites , suggesting ibrutinib functions as an P00533 inhibitor . Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank test . All statistical tests were two-sided . In vivo study showed that ibrutinib statistically significantly suppressed H1975 tumor growth and prolonged survival of the tumor bearing mice ( n = 5 per group ) . The mean survival times for solvent- and erlotinib-treated mice were both 17.8 days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 14.3 to 21.3 days ) , while the mean survival time for ibrutinib-treated mice was 29.8 days ( 95 % CI = 26.0 to 33.6 days , P = .008 ) . Our results indicate that ibrutinib could be a candidate drug for treatment of P00533 -mutant NSCLC , including erlotinib-resistant tumors .
