Potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by papaverine : role played by P98160 -γ , IP3 receptors . DB01113 , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 10A , is gaining attention for its potential in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia . However , the precise mechanisms underlying the putative neuroprotective/neurotrophic actions of papaverine remain unclear . Thus , we investigated the effects of papaverine on nerve growth factor ( P01138 ) -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells . DB01113 potentiated P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner . In contrast , the selective Q9Y233 inhibitor MP-10 had no effect on P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth . The potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth by papaverine was blocked by the P98160 -γ inhibitor U73122 . Furthermore , papaverine 's potentiation of P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth was also blocked by the co-administration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( IP(3) ) receptor antagonists ( xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate ( 2- Q9H4A4 ) ) and by reduced expression of IP(3) receptor gene ( i.e. , itpr1 and itpr3 ) by siRNA . Our findings suggest that papaverine could potentiate P01138 -induced neurite outgrowth , and that activation of P98160 -γ and IP(3) receptors might be involved in the mechanism underlying papaverine 's potentiation of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells .
