Role of protein kinase C in agonist-induced desensitization of 5-HT‚ÇÅA receptor coupling to calcium channels in P03951 cells . The 5-Hydroxytriptamine 1A receptor ( P08908 ) is expressed both as a pre- and post-synaptic receptor in neurons . The presynaptic receptor preferentially desensitizes compared to post-synaptic receptors , suggesting different underlying mechanisms of agonist-induced desensitization . Using P03951 cells as a model of post-synaptic neurons , the present study examined the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and protein kinase A ( PKA ) in desensitization of the P08908 -receptor by agonist . Desensitization in whole cell experiments was dependent on internal [ Ca(2+) ] and was blocked by chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) . Using the perforated patch technique , desensitization was reduced when Ba(2+) was used as the conducting cation . Selective inhibitors of conventional PKC isoforms prevented 5-HT-induced desensitization , whereas an inhibitor of PKA did not . In cells in which 3 PKC/PKA sites located in the third intracellular loop ( i3 ) of the P08908 receptor were mutated ( i3 , T229A-S253G-T343A ) , 5-HT-mediated desensitization was reduced ( and abolished in the absence of intracellular Ca(2+) ) . In cells in which a fourth mutation was added ( T149 in the second i2 loop ) , the cells responded similarly to the triple mutants suggesting that phosphorylation of T149 does not contribute greatly to the desensitization induced by 5-HT-mediated activation of PKC . Thus agonist-induced uncoupling of the P08908 -receptor is PKC-dependent , but requires a different set of phosphorylation sites than phorbol ester-mediated PKC activation , suggesting differential recruitment of PKC . Furthermore , these studies reveal that P08908 -receptor desensitization utilizes a different kinase in P03951 cells and serotonergic neurons , which may in part account for their differential sensitivity in vivo .
