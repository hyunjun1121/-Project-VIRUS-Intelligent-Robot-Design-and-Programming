MGC9753 gene , located within Q9UD71 - Q14849 - P04626 - Q14451 amplicon on human chromosome 17q12 , encodes the seven-transmembrane receptor with extracellular six-cystein domain . MYC , P04626 , MET , P21802 , P24864 , P04198 , P09544 , P16070 , Q00987 , Q9Y6Q9 , P46940 and O14965 loci are amplified in human gastric cancer . It has been reported that the gene corresponding to EST H16094 is co-amplified with P04626 gene in human gastric cancer . Here , we identified and characterized the gene corresponding to EST H16094 by using bioinformatics . BLAST programs revealed that EST H16094 was derived from the uncharacterized MGC9753 gene . Two ORFs were predicted within human MGC9753 mRNA , and ORF1 ( nucleotide position 18-980 of NM_033419.1 ) was predicted as the coding region of human MGC9753 mRNA based on comparative genomics . Nucleotide sequence of mouse Mgc9753 mRNA was next determined in silico by modification of AK052486 cDNA ( deleting C at the nucleotide position 37 ) . Human MGC9753 and mouse Mgc9753 proteins were 320-amino-acid seven-transmembrane receptors with the N-terminal six-cysteine domain and an N-glycosylation site ( 85.0 % total-amino-acid identity ) . Human MGC9753 protein showed 90.6 % total-amino-acid identity with human CAB2 aberrant protein , which lacked the third-transmembrane domain of MGC9753 due to frame shifts within ORF . Human MGC9753 gene , consisting of eight exons , were clustered with Q9UD71 , Q14849 , O15273 , PNMT , P04626 , MGC14832 and Q14451 genes within the 120-kb region . Q9UD71 , Q14849 , MGC9753 , P04626 and Q14451 genes are co-amplified in several cases of gastric cancer . This is the first report on comprehensive characterization of the amplicon around the Q9UD71 - Q14849 - O15273 -PNMT-MGC9753- P04626 -MGC14832- Q14451 locus on human chromosome 17q12 .
