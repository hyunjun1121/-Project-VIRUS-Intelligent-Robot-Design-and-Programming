How safe is infliximab therapy during pregnancy and lactation in inflammatory bowel disease ? INTRODUCTION : DB00065 has been approved for the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases ( Q9UKU7 ) . However , data regarding its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding are scarce . AREAS COVERED : Relevant papers sourced from bibliographical searches ( MEDLINE ) up to June 2014 are reviewed . DB00065 , as adalimumab , crosses the placenta from the end of the second trimester . The use of anti- P01375 agents after the second trimester leads to intrauterine exposure . Although infliximab during pregnancy in Q9UKU7 patients seems to be safe in the short-term , there are concerns about the consequences of the early exposition with this drug for the development of the newborn immune system . Accordingly , it has recently been suggested that anti- P01375 drugs should be stopped during , at least , the second trimester , when the mother is in remission ; this approach seems to be safe for the mother and minimizes fetal exposition to the drug . DB00065 has been detected in breast milk in miniscule amounts . Case reports do not suggest toxicity ; however , the effects of exposure on the neonate merit further investigation . EXPERT OPINION : DB00065 appears to be safe for the mother with Q9UKU7 and the newborn , at least in the short-term . DB00065 is transferred in breast milk ; although its toxicity is unlikely , it can not be discounted without further long-term data .
