Phosphodiesterase 4B mediates extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent up-regulation of mucin P98088 protein by Streptococcus pneumoniae by inhibiting DB02527 -protein kinase A-dependent P28562 phosphatase pathway . Otitis media ( OM ) is the most common childhood bacterial infection and the major cause of conductive hearing loss in children . Mucus overproduction is a hallmark of OM . Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common gram-positive bacterial pathogen causing OM . Among many mucin genes , P98088 has been found to be greatly up-regulated in the middle ear mucosa of human patients with OM . We previously reported that S. pneumoniae up-regulates P98088 expression in a MAPK P29323 -dependent manner . We also found that MAPK phosphatase-1 ( P28562 ) negatively regulates S. pneumoniae-induced P29323 -dependent P98088 up-regulation . Therapeutic strategies for up-regulating the expression of negative regulators such as P28562 may have significant therapeutic potential for treating mucus overproduction in OM . However , the underlying molecular mechanism by which P28562 expression is negatively regulated during S. pneumoniae infection is unknown . In this study we show that phosphodiesterase 4B ( Q07343 ) mediates S. pneumoniae-induced P98088 up-regulation by inhibiting the expression of a negative regulator P28562 , which in turn leads to enhanced MAPK P29323 activation and subsequent up-regulation of P98088 . Q07343 inhibits P28562 expression in a DB02527 -PKA-dependent manner . DB05876 -specific inhibitor rolipram inhibits S. pneumoniae-induced P98088 up-regulation both in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , we show that Q07343 plays a critical role in P98088 induction . Finally , topical and post-infection administration of rolipram into the middle ear potently inhibited S. pneumoniae-induced P98088 up-regulation . Collectively , these data demonstrate that Q07343 mediates P29323 -dependent up-regulation of mucin P98088 by S. pneumoniae by inhibiting DB02527 -PKA-dependent P28562 pathway . This study may lead to novel therapeutic strategy for inhibiting mucus overproduction .
