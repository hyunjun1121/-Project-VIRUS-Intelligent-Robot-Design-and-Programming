The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and estrogen receptors in genistein-induced regulation of vascular tone in female rat aortas . BACKGROUND : DB01645 ( Q86UG4 ) is a phytoestrogen that binds estrogen receptors ( ER ) to produce a protective cardiovascular effect . It also has been shown binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) . METHODS : In the present study , we assessed the role of P37231 and ER in Q86UG4 -mediated regulation of vascular tone in female rat aortas by in vitro tension measurement , immunohistochemistry , immunofluorescence , immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis . RESULTS : In aortas pretreated with GW9662 ( inhibitor of P37231 ) , ICI182780 ( inhibitor of ER ) and a combination of GW9662 and ICI182780 , the magnitudes of Q86UG4 -induced dilatation were attenuated . N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester had a similar effect . Q92731 and P37231 colocalized in all 3 layers of the aortas , while P03372 and P37231 colocalized only in the vascular endothelium and adventitia . In Q86UG4 -treated whole-cell protein samples , we demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Q92731 ( not P03372 ) and P37231 . The expression of Q92731 and P37231 in nuclear protein from Q86UG4 -treated samples increased , which was partially reversed by either GW9662 or ICI182780 and more efficiently reversed using a combination of GW9662 and ICI182780 . CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that Q86UG4 can relax phenylephrine-induced vascular contraction in female rat aortas , which is mediated by P37231 and Q92731 .
