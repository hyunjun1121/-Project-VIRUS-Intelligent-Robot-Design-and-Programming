O60760 is expressed in microglia in the developing postnatal mouse brain . O60760 ( O60760 ) is a P52209 (2)-synthesizing enzyme and is expressed in antigen-presenting cells , mast cells , and other immunocompetent cells . We here report the O60760 expression in microglia and the migration pathway of microglia in the developing mouse brain as detected by O60760 immunohistochemistry . Expression of O60760 mRNA peaked at postnatal day ( P01160 ) 10 , decreased gradually thereafter , and reached a plateau at P01160 20 . The mRNAs for target molecules of P52209 (2) , i.e. , DP receptor ( DPR ) and Q9Y5Y4 receptor , showed developmental profiles overlapped to that of O60760 . Most of the O60760 (+) cells at P01160 10 had morphological characteristics of ameboid microglia and gave positive immunostaining with microglia-specific markers such as RCA-1 , F4/80 , or ER-MP12 . These specific markers became less detectable later on , but O60760 was still expressed even in resting microglia . Thus , O60760 is a useful marker for investigation of microglial development . Spaciotemporal evaluation of microglial development and migration with O60760 immunostaining revealed the following three major possible migration pathways of microglia in the postnatal brain : from the lateral ventricle via subventricular zones to brain parenchyma ; from the leptomeninges around the cerebellopontine angle to the cerebellar white matter ; and from the overlying leptomeninges to the hippocampus , basal forebrain , and brainstem .
