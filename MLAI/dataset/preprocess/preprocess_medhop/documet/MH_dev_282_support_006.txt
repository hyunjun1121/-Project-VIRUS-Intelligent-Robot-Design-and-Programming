Families of retinoid dehydrogenases regulating vitamin A function : production of visual pigment and retinoic acid . DB00162 ( retinol ) and provitamin A ( beta-carotene ) are metabolized to specific retinoid derivatives which function in either vision or growth and development . The metabolite 11-cis-retinal functions in light absorption for vision in chordate and nonchordate animals , whereas all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid function as ligands for nuclear retinoic acid receptors that regulate gene expression only in chordate animals . Investigation of retinoid metabolic pathways has resulted in the identification of numerous retinoid dehydrogenases that potentially contribute to metabolism of various retinoid isomers to produce active forms . These enzymes fall into three major families . Dehydrogenases catalyzing the reversible oxidation/reduction of retinol and retinal are members of either the alcohol dehydrogenase ( DB00067 ) or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase ( SDR ) enzyme families , whereas dehydrogenases catalyzing the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid are members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) family . Compilation of the known retinoid dehydrogenases indicates the existence of 17 nonorthologous forms : five ADHs , eight SDRs , and four ALDHs , eight of which are conserved in both mouse and human . Genetic studies indicate in vivo roles for two ADHs ( P07327 and P08319 ) , one SDR ( Q92781 ) , and two ALDHs ( P00352 and O94788 ) all of which are conserved between humans and rodents . For several SDRs ( RoDH1 , RoDH4 , CRAD1 , and CRAD2 ) androgens rather than retinoids are the predominant substrates suggesting a function in androgen metabolism as well as retinoid metabolism .
