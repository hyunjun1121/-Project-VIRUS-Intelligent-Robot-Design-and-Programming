Effects of addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator in in vitro fertilization medium on bovine embryo development and quality . P00747 activators/Plasmin system plays pivotal role in regulating reproductive functions of mammals . Here , we examined the effects of modification of in vitro fertilization medium ( IVF medium ) with the addition of tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) , on bovine embryo development and quality , assessed by quantification of expression of various genes related to metabolism , oxidation , implantation and apoptosis . In addition , plasminogen activator activity ( PAA ) and plasminogen activator inhibition ( P05121 ) were measured in the spent media . After conventional IVM , 2016 cumulus-oocyte complexes ( COCs ) were divided into four groups with modified composition of the IVF medium containing t-PA and/or its inhibitor epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( control , t-PA , t-PA+ε-ACA , ε-ACA ) . Presumptive zygotes were cultured for 8 days in synthetic oviductal fluid ( SOF ) medium ; gene expression studies were carried out on morulae and blastocysts . t-PA alone significantly suppressed cleavage and blastocyst formation rates , but this effect was neutralized by the addition of ε-ACA . PAA in the treated group was significantly reduced by ε-ACA , but without total elimination . Significant differences were detected in the expression of genes related to apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest ( Q07812 , Q07817 , Q92831 ) between embryos produced in t-PA-modified media and controls , giving an overall notion that the inferior developmental competence of treated embryos may be attributed to apoptotic phenomena induced by t-PA . In conclusion , it appears that excessive t-PA content in the IVF media , suppresses blastocyst formation rate , possibly due to induction of apoptotic phenomena .
