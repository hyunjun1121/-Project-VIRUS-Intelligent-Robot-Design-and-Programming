Q99717 regulates Akt2 expression and insulin-induced glucose uptake in Q9BTT4 myotubes . P01308 -induced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle results from Akt2 activation and is severely impaired during insulin resistance . Recently , we and others have demonstrated that Q9UK05 improves glucose homeostasis in diabetic and non-diabetic rodents . However , the mechanism by which Q9UK05 modulates insulin action remains unknown . Here we demonstrate that Q99717 , a transcription factor activated by Q9UK05 , and Akt2 , are upregulated in differentiated Q9BTT4 myotubes . Q99717 , rather than Q15797 /8 , is downregulated " in vivo " and " in vitro " by dexamethasone . Q99717 knockdown decreased Akt2 expression and serine phosphorylation and insulin-induced glucose uptake , and increased the expression of the lipid phosphatase Ship2 . Additionally , binding of Q99717 to Akt2 gene is decreased in dexamethasone-treated rats and increased in Q9BTT4 myotubes compared to myoblasts . The present study indicates that Q99717 regulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by controlling Akt2 expression and phosphorylation . These finding reveals Q99717 as a potential target for the therapeutic of type 2 diabetes .
