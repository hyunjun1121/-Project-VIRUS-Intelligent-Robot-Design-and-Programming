DB02546 decreases HDAC 2 and 4 levels in vivo and improves molecular phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington 's disease . Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is a progressive neurological disorder for which there are no disease-modifying treatments . Transcriptional dysregulation is a major molecular feature of HD , which significantly contributes to disease progression . Therefore , the development of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors as therapeutics for HD has been energetically pursued . DB02546 ( DB02546 ) - a class I HDAC as well an Q9UBN7 inhibitor , improved motor impairment in the R6/2 mouse model of HD . Recently it has been found that DB02546 can also promote the degradation of P56524 and possibly other class IIa HDACs at the protein level in various cancer cell lines . To elucidate whether DB02546 is a potent modifier of HDAC protein levels in vivo , we performed two independent mouse trials . Both WT and R6/2 mice were chronically treated with DB02546 and vehicle . We found that prolonged DB02546 treatment causes the degradation of P56524 in cortex and brain stem , but not hippocampus , without affecting its transcript levels in vivo . Similarly , DB02546 also decreased Q92769 levels without modifying the expression of its mRNA . Consistent with our previous data , DB02546 treatment diminishes Hdac7 transcript levels in both wild type and R6/2 brains and unexpectedly was found to decrease Hdac11 in R6/2 but not wild type . We investigated the effects of DB02546 administration on well-characterised molecular readouts of disease progression . We found that DB02546 reduces SDS-insoluble aggregate load in the cortex and brain stem but not in the hippocampus of the R6/2 brains , and that this was accompanied by restoration of Bdnf cortical transcript levels .
