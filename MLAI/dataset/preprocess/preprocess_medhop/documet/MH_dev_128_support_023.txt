DNA binding-independent induction of P25963 gene transcription by PPARalpha . PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate energy homeostasis . In addition , PPARs furthermore control the inflammatory response by antagonizing the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) signaling pathway . We recently demonstrated that PPARalpha activators increase P25963 mRNA and protein levels in human aortic smooth muscle cells . Here , we studied the molecular mechanisms by which PPARalpha controls P25963 expression . Using transient transfection assays , it is demonstrated that PPARalpha potentiates p65-stimulated P25963 transcription in a ligand-dependent manner . Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that PPARalpha activation of P25963 transcription requires the NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites within P25963 promoter . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that PPARalpha activation enhances the occupancy of the NF-kappaB response element in P25963 promoter in vivo . Overexpression of the oncoprotein E1A failed to inhibit PPARalpha-mediated P25963 promoter induction , suggesting that DB02527 response element binding protein-binding protein/p300 is not involved in this mechanism . By contrast , a dominant-negative form of P11473 -interacting protein 205 ( Q15648 ) comprising its two LXXLL motifs completely abolished PPARalpha ligand-mediated activation . Furthermore , cotransfection of increasing amounts of Q15648 relieved this inhibition , suggesting that PPARalpha requires Q15648 to regulate P25963 promoter activity . By contrast , Q15648 is not involved in PPARalpha-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional repression . Taken together , these data provide a molecular basis for PPARalpha-mediated induction of P25963 and demonstrate , for the first time , that PPARalpha may positively regulate gene transcription in the absence of functional Q07869 response elements .
