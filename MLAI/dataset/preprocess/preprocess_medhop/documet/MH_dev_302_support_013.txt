The glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter family Q99705 : molecular , physiological and pharmacological aspects . The solute carrier family 1 ( Q99705 ) includes five high-affinity glutamate transporters , P43005 , GLT-1 , P43003 , P48664 and O00341 ( P43005 , P43004 , P43003 , P48664 , and O00341 , respectively ) as well as the two neutral amino acid transporters , P43007 and Q15758 ( P43007 and ALC1A5 , respectively ) . Although each of these transporters have similar predicted structures , they exhibit distinct functional properties which are variations of a common transport mechanism . The high-affinity glutamate transporters mediate transport of l- DB00142 , l- DB00128 and d- DB00128 , accompanied by the cotransport of 3 Na(+) and 1 H(+) , and the countertransport of 1 K(+) , whereas ASC transporters mediate Na(+)-dependent exchange of small neutral amino acids such as Ala , DB00133 , DB00151 and DB00156 . The unique coupling of the glutamate transporters allows uphill transport of glutamate into cells against a concentration gradient . This feature plays a crucial role in protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system . During pathological conditions , such as brain ischemia ( e.g. after a stroke ) , however , glutamate exit can occur due to " reversed glutamate transport " , which is caused by a reversal of the electrochemical gradients of the coupling ions . Selective inhibition of the neuronal glutamate transporter P43005 ( P43005 ) may be of therapeutic interest to block glutamate release from neurons during ischemia . On the other hand , upregulation of the glial glutamate transporter P43004 ( P43004 ) may help protect motor neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) , since loss of function of P43004 has been associated with the pathogenesis of certain forms of P35858 .
