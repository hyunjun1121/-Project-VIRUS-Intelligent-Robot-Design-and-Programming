Analysis of neurogenic contractions induced by ML-1035 and other benzamides in the guinea-pig non-stimulated isolated ileum . 4-Amino-5-chloro-substituted benzamides have been shown to increase gastric motility in-vivo and enhance field-stimulated and peristaltic contractions in-vitro . The present experiments examined the contractile response to a series of benzamides in the guinea-pig non-stimulated ileum . Four benzamides elicited contractions in the isolated ileum which were expressed as a percentage of the contraction induced by 1 microM acetylcholine ( % acetylcholine response = 12 +/- 2 , 19 +/- 3 , 26 +/- 2 , 51 +/- 3 , n = 13 , 8 , 17 , and 21 , with EC50 values of 0.85 , 1.8 , 5.7 , and 14.2 microM for cisapride , zacopride , metoclopramide , and ML-1035 ( 4-amino-5-chloro-2-((2-methylsulphinyl)-ethoxy)-N- ( 2-(diethylamino)-ethyl ) -benzamide hydrochloride ) , respectively ) . ML-1035 contractions were completely blocked by atropine and tetrodotoxin , while ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium was ineffective . DB01233 has been reported to sensitize postjunctional muscarinic receptors , however , ML-1035 did not enhance acetylcholine-induced contractions . Tropisetron ( ICS 205-930 , 1 microM ) , caused a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for both ML-1035 and zacopride ( EC50 = 14.2 +/- 1.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.8 microM in the absence , and 26 +/- 2.7 and 6.9 +/- 2.3 microM in the presence of tropisetron for ML-1035 and zacopride , respectively ) with apparent pKB values of 5.9 and 6.0 for the respective compounds . 5-Hydroxytryptaminergic receptor desensitization by 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5- Q9H205 ) and 5-methoxytryptamine ( Q13639 ) , attenuated the response to ML-1035.
