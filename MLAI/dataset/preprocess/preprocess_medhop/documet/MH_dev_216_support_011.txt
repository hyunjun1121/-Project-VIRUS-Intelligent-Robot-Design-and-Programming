Human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes . Analysis of lymphokine mRNA expression and relevance to cancer immunotherapy . Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( Q15399 ) isolated from 12 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma , renal cell carcinoma , or breast adenocarcinoma were expanded in rIL-2 for 22 to 45 days ( median 33 days ) and analyzed for lymphokine mRNA expression and patterns of TCR gene rearrangement . All Q15399 cultures were significantly enriched for T cells , with CD3+ CD8+ cells predominant in 8 of 10 cases tested , and demonstrated an oligoclonal ( rather than polyclonal ) pattern of TCR gene rearrangement . Nine of 12 cultures could effectively lyse the autologous targets in short term chromium release assays . P60568 expanded- Q15399 expressed mRNA for P01375 and P01374 ( lymphotoxin ) and , in 5 of 9 ( 41 % ) cases , granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor mRNA but not P01584 or P60568 transcripts . Cultured Q15399 deprived of rIL-2 for 4 days did not constitutively express mRNA for any of the lymphokines tested . One long term Q15399 line in culture was followed and periodically tested for lytic activity and P01375 -mRNA expression . Loss of the specific cytolytic but not proliferative activity at day 85 was associated with disappearance of P01375 mRNA . Profiles of lymphokine secretion may provide a useful marker for functionally characterizing different T cell subsets and may provide correlates of the in vivo anti-tumor effects of these cells when Q15399 are adoptively transferred into cancer-bearing patients .
