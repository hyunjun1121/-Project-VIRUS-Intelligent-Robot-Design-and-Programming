A common single nucleotide polymorphism can exacerbate long-QT type 2 syndrome leading to sudden infant death . BACKGROUND : Identification of infants at risk for sudden arrhythmic death remains one of the leading challenges of modern medicine . We present a family in which a common polymorphism ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) inherited from the father , combined with a stop codon mutation inherited from the mother ( both asymptomatic ) , led to 2 cases of sudden infant death . METHODS AND RESULTS : P51787 , Q12809 , Q14524 , P15382 , Q9Y6J6 , CACNA1c , CACNB2b , and P63252 genes were amplified and analyzed by direct sequencing . Functional electrophysiological studies were performed with the single nucleotide polymorphism and mutation expressed singly and in combination in Chinese ovary ( CHO- P04264 ) and COS-1 cells . An asymptomatic woman presenting after the death of her 2-day-old infant and spontaneous abortion of a second baby in the first trimester was referred for genetic analysis . The newborn infant had nearly incessant ventricular tachycardia while in utero and a prolonged QTc ( 560 ms ) . The mother was asymptomatic but displayed a prolonged QTc . Genetic screening of the mother revealed a heterozygous nonsense mutation ( P926AfsX14 ) in Q12809 , predicting a stop codon . The father was asymptomatic with a normal QTc but had a heterozygous polymorphism ( K897T ) in Q12809 . The baby who died at 2 days of age and the aborted fetus inherited both K897T and P926AfsX14 . Heterologous coexpression of K897T and P926AfsX14 led to loss of function of Q12809 current much greater than expression of K897T or P926AfsX14 alone . CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that a common polymorphism ( K897T ) can markedly accentuate the loss of function of mildly defective Q12809 channels , leading to long-QT syndrome-mediated arrhythmias and sudden infant death .
