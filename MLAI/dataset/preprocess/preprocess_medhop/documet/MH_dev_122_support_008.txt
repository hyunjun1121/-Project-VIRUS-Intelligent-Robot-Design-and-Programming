Induction of granulocytic differentiation in myeloblasts by hydroquinone , a metabolite of benzene , involves the leukotriene D4 receptor . Chronic exposure of humans to benzene ( BZ ) , a Class I carcinogen , causes acute myelogenous leukemia , possibly via its bone marrow metabolite , hydroquinone ( HQ ) . The ability to alter cytokine-dependent growth and differentiation in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells appears to be a property of agents with leukemogenic potential . We have previously reported that BZ and HQ specifically stimulate granulopoiesis in mice and cause granulocytic differentiation in normal murine interleukin ( IL ) -3-dependent , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( DB00099 ) -inducible 32D myeloblasts . BZ induces granulocytic differentiation by upregulating the production of leukotriene D4 ( LTD4 ) , an essential intracellular mediator of G- P04141 signaling . We report here that HQ ( 0.5-4.0 microM ) , as well as LTD4 ( 1 nM-10 microM ) , causes a concentration-dependent induction of granulocytic differentiation in 32D myeloblasts . Unlike LTD4 , which induces terminal granulocytic differentiation , HQ undergoes a myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation to bioreactive p-benzoquinone ( BQ ) , which induces differentiation predominantly to the myelocyte stage . Studies with the highly specific Q9Y271 antagonist , MK-571 , suggest that BQ induces granulocytic differentiation in myeloblasts by activating the Q9Y271 , thus obviating the requirement for LTD4 . This was confirmed by the demonstration that HQ , in the presence of LTD4 , shifts the stage-specific pattern of terminal differentiation induced by LTD4 to the incomplete ( myelocyte ) profile induced by HQ . The inability of HQ to induce a complete program of terminal granulocytic differentiation in myeloblasts , as well as its ability to compete with induction by LTD4 , may have a bearing on the leukemogenic potential of BZ .
