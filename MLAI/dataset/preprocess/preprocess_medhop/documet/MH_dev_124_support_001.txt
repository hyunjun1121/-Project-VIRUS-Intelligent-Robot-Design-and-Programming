The genes encoding cytokines P60568 , P22301 and P29460 are primary DB00136 target genes . A number of studies have described the effects of DB00136 in immune system . Most of the known effects of DB00136 are indirect since only two functional VDREs that regulate transcription of cytokine gene has been reported until today . In this study we have examined a possibility of direct transcriptional regulation of P60568 , P22301 and P29460 genes in activated Jurkat or THP-1 cells via liganded P11473 by using gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays . According to our data the P60568 , P22301 and P29460 genes respond to DB00136 treatment by 3-6 h . In addition , all of these genes contain several genomic regions that recruit P11473 in a ligand dependent fashion . These data suggest that the above cytokines are under direct transcriptional regulation by DB00136 .
