Anti-inflammatory properties of Septilin in lipopolysaccharide activated monocytes and macrophage . In vivo studies have suggested the immunomodulatory properties of Septilin , an herbal preparation . This drug is being used against various types of inflammatory disorders . However , the mechanism of action of Septilin in the modulation of inflammation is not explored using suitable in vitro models . Hence , we decided to study the modulatory role of Septilin in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) mediated signaling in macrophage and monocyte cells . It was observed from the present study that by employing tumor necrosis factor α ( P01375 -α ) bioassay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , Septilin inhibited P01375 -α production in LPS ( 1 μg/mL ) stimulated RAW 264.7 cells ( p < 0.05 ) . 80 % inhibition of P01375 -α was observed even at 2.5 % Septilin . Septilin at all the concentrations tested could also significantly block the LPS mediated nitric oxide ( NO ) production ( p < 0.01 ) and expression of inducible NO synthase ( P35228 ) gene . LPS mediated interleukin 6 ( P05231 ) and P10145 production was also blocked by Septilin at the concentrations tested . This herbal preparation could also inhibit cycloxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) activity and suppression of P35354 and phosphodiesterase 4 B ( Q07343 ) mRNA expression in a concentration dependent manner . Taken together , these findings from the present in vitro study suggest the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of Septilin .
