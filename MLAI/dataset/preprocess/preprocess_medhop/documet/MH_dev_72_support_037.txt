Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( P09874 ) is required in murine cell lines for base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage in the absence of P06746 . Oxidative DNA base damage is mainly corrected by the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway , which can be divided into two subpathways depending on the length of the resynthetized patch , either one nucleotide for short patch BER or several nucleotides for long patch BER . The role of proteins in the course of BER processes has been investigated in vitro using purified enzymes and cell-free extracts . In this study , we have investigated the repair of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG ) in vivo using wild-type , polymerase beta(-/-) ( Polbeta(-/-) ) , poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(-/-) ( P09874 (-/-) ) , and Polbeta(-/-) P09874 (-/-) 3T3 cell lines . We used non replicating plasmids containing a 8-oxoG:C base pair to study the repair of the lesion located in a transcribed sequence ( TS ) or in a non-transcribed sequence ( P30990 ) . The results show that 8-oxoG repair in TS is not significantly impaired in cells deficient in Polbeta or P09874 or both . Whereas 8-oxoG repair in P30990 is normal in Polbeta-null cells , it is delayed in P09874 -null cells and greatly impaired in cells deficient in both Polbeta and P09874 . The removal of 8-oxoG and presumably the cleavage at the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site are not affected in the P09874 (-/-)Polbeta(-/-) cell lines . However , 8-oxoG repair is incomplete , yielding plasmid molecules with a nick at the site of the lesion . Therefore , P09874 (-/-)Polbeta(-/-) cell lines can not perform 5'-dRP removal and/or DNA repair synthesis . Furthermore , the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of P09874 is essential for 8-oxoG repair in a Polbeta(-/-) context , because expression of the catalytically inactive P09874 ( E988K ) mutant does not restore 8-oxoG repair , whereas an wild type P09874 does .
