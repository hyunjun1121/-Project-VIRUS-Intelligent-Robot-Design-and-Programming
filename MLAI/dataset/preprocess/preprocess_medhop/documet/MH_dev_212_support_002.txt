A review of treatment with mepolizumab , an anti- P05113 mAb , in hypereosinophilic syndromes and asthma . The hypereosinophilic syndromes ( HESs ) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia with end-organ damage and varying in severity from nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening . Treatment objectives are a safe reduction of blood and tissue eosinophil levels and prevention of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage . Current treatment of patients with HESs , who lack the Q7L523 -like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( Q6UN15 - P16234 ) fusion gene , is mainly systemic corticosteroid therapy . Eosinophil development from hematopoietic progenitor cells is regulated by P05113 , which influences maturation , differentiation , mobilization , activation , and survival . Consequently , inhibiting P05113 is a logical therapeutic objective for patients with HESs or selected patients with asthma . DB06612 is a fully humanized anti- P05113 monoclonal IgG(1) antibody that binds to free P05113 with high affinity and specificity to prevent P05113 from associating with the P05113 receptor complex alpha-chain on the surface of eosinophils . In clinical trials with patients with HESs , mepolizumab reduced blood eosinophil counts and the maintenance corticosteroid dose and had no major safety concerns . DB06612 reduced airway and blood eosinophils and prevented asthma exacerbations . Thus , mepolizumab may be effective for long-term treatment of patients with selected eosinophilic disorders .
