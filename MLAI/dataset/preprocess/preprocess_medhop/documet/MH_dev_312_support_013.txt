DB01268 : a P15692 and PDGF receptor protein kinase and angiogenesis inhibitor . DB01268 ( SU-11248 , Sutent ) inhibits at least eight receptor protein-tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 ( P17948 - P35916 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta ) , stem cell factor receptor ( Kit ) , Flt-3 , and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor ( P07333 ) . P17948 and P35968 play key roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis . PDGFRbeta , which is found in pericytes that surround capillary endothelial cells , plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the vascular endothelium . DB01268 inhibits angiogenesis by diminishing signaling through P17948 , P35968 , and PDGFRbeta . Renal cell cancers that have metastasized , or spread from the primary tumor , exhibit extensive vascularity , and sunitinib is approved for the treatment of these neoplasms . Activating Kit mutations occur in about 85 % of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and activating PDGFRalpha mutations occur in about 5 % of these tumors . DB01268 is approved for the treatment of those tumors that are resistant to imatinib ( STI-571 , Gleevec ) , another Kit and PDGFRalpha protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Both sunitinib and imatinib bind reversibly to the DB00171 binding site of their target kinases and thereby inhibit their catalytic activity .
