Safety , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of four-hour intravenous infusions of eritoran in healthy Japanese and Caucasian men . DB04933 , a synthetic analogue of lipid A , has been shown to bind to O00206 /MD-2 complex and thereby block the interaction of endotoxins with O00206 . We report here the results of a study conducted to assess the single-dose safety and tolerability , as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics , of eritoran infusion in Japanese and Caucasian healthy adult men . Sixty-four men ( aged 20-45 years ; body mass index 18-30 kg/m(2) ) were randomized into four groups : 4-mg total dose ( six Japanese and six Caucasian men ) ; 12-mg total dose ( 12 Japanese and 12 Caucasian men ) ; 28-mg total dose ( six Japanese and six Caucasian men ) ; and placebo ( eight Japanese and eight Caucasian men ) . DB04933 in single doses up to 28 mg over 4 h was well tolerated , with no apparent ethnic differences noted . Plasma concentrations were slightly higher in Japanese versus Caucasian men ; these differences were not significant after adjustment for differences in body mass ( clearance : approximately 1.2 ml/h/kg ; volume of distribution at steady state : approximately 0.07 l/kg ) . The ex vivo endotoxin inhibitory activity of eritoran was similar in Japanese and Caucasian men . The data do not indicate any need for clinical dose adjustment for possible ethnic-based differences in drug distribution or metabolism .
