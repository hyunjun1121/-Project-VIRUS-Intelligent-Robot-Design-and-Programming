A randomised , double-blind study comparing lumiracoxib with naproxen for acute musculoskeletal pain . BACKGROUND : Some selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors have been shown to provide analgesic efficacy in patients with acute pain . AIM : To compare the efficacy and safety of the P35354 inhibitor lumiracoxib 400 mg once daily ( qd ) and naproxen 500 mg twice daily ( bid ) in patients with acute musculoskeletal pain caused by uncomplicated soft tissue injury . METHODS : This was a randomised , double-blind , parallel-group , non-inferiority study set in 39 primary care centres in the UK . Patients were randomised to lumiracoxib 400 mg qd or naproxen 500 mg bid and took the study medication for as long as they felt that it was needed , up to day 7 . The primary efficacy analysis was the sum of the pain intensity difference ( 0-100 mm visual analogue scale ) determined morning and evening over the first 5 days of treatment ( SPID-5 ) . RESULTS : The intention-to-treat population comprised 406 patients [ lumiracoxib 400 mg qd ( n = 207 ) ; naproxen 500 mg bid ( n = 199 ) ] . Both treatments were effective in reducing pain intensity over 5 days . The mean SPID-5 scores were 117.0 mm.day for lumiracoxib and 118.2 mm.day for naproxen [ the treatment difference based on adjusted means from the ANCOVA was -2.78 mm.day , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -17.4 , 11.9 ] . The lower margin of the 95 % CI was above the predetermined non-inferiority margin ( -50 mm.day ) for SPID-5 , indicating non-inferiority of lumiracoxib compared with naproxen . Both treatments were well tolerated . CONCLUSION : DB01283 400 mg qd is as effective as naproxen 500 mg bid for the management of moderate-to-severe acute musculoskeletal pain .
