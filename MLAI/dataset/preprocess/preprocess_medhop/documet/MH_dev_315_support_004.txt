DB01221 receptor modulation by the neuropeptide apelin : implications for excitotoxic injury . Excitotoxic neuronal damage via over-activation of the DB01221 receptor has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases . In vitro modeling of excitotoxic injury has shown that activation of G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) counteracts such injury through modulation of neuronal pro-survival pathways and/or DB01221 receptor signaling . We have previously demonstrated that the GPCR P35414 and its endogenous neuropeptide ligand apelin can protect neurons against excitotoxicity , but the mechanism(s) of this neuroprotection remain incompletely understood . We hypothesized that apelin can promote neuronal survival by activating pro-survival signaling as well as inhibiting DB01221 receptor-mediated excitotoxic signaling cascades . Our results demonstrate that ( i ) apelin activates pro-survival signaling via inositol trisphosphate ( IP(3) ) , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 ( Q02750 /2 ) , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) to protect against excitotoxicity , and ( ii ) apelin inhibits excitotoxic signaling by attenuating DB01221 receptor and calpain activity , and by modulating DB01221 receptor subunit Q13224 phosphorylation at serine 1480 . These studies delineate a novel apelinergic signaling pathway that concurrently promotes survival and limits DB01221 receptor-mediated injury to protect neurons against excitotoxicity . Defining apelin-mediated neuroprotection advances our understanding of neuroprotective pathways and will potentially improve our ability to develop therapeutics for excitotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative disorders .
