Oncostatin M and interleukin 6 inhibit cell cycle progression by prevention of p27kip1 degradation in HepG2 cells . We analysed the regulation of P55008 -phase progression in relation to cytokine receptor signalling in HepG2 hepatoma cells , stably transduced with the P22301 receptor after stimulation with Oncostatin M ( P13725 ) , P05231 , Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor ( P15018 ) and P22301 . All cytokines induced P40763 phosphorylation to approximately the same level , but only P13725 , and to a lesser extent P05231 , induced P42229 phosphorylation . The cytokines also stimulated phosphorylation of P29323 in the order of decreasing effectiveness : P13725 > P05231 > P15018 > P22301 . The same order of activity of the cytokines was observed on inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the P55008 -phase of the cell cycle . These processes were accompanied by a decrease in cyclin A expression and P24941 activity , and enhanced accumulation of p27kip1 . The level of p27kip1 mRNA expression was unaffected by the cytokines , and maintenance of the elevated level of p27kip1 occurred independently of de novo protein synthesis . Furthermore , inhibition of proteasomal activity increased the level of p27kip1 in the unstimulated cells to the same level as in P13725 -treated cells . Inhibition of MEK activation completely abrogated P13725 and P05231 induced p27kip1 accumulation , while expression of dominant negative P42229 decreased the P13725 and P05231 mediated inhibition of DNA-synthesis and partially inhibited p27kip1 accumulation .
