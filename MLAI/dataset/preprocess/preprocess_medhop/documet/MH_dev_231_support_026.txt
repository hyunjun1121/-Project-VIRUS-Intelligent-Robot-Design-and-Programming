P02787 enhances the antiproliferative effect of aluminum on osteoblast-like cells . DB01370 ( Al ) retention in the body can cause metabolic bone disease . This disorder is characterized by reductions in the number of osteoblasts , a feature that suggests a disturbance in bone cell proliferation or differentiation . Because Al as well as iron ( Fe ) can bind to transferrin ( TF ) in plasma , the role of TF as a modifier of osteoblast proliferation was examined in UMR-106-01 osteoblast-like cells by measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ( [ 3H ] -TdR ) into DNA ( counts.min-1.microgram cell protein-1 , means +/- SE ) during 48-h incubations in serum-free medium ( SFM ) . In the absence of TF , DNA synthesis decreased when media levels of Al exceeded 6-10 microM . The mitogenic response to physiological levels of unsaturated TF ( apo-TF ) was attenuated however during incubations with TF that was partially saturated with Al ( Al-TF ) . A similar inhibitory response was seen in cells incubated with the antiproliferative agent gallium ( Ga ) when added to SFM as partially saturated Ga-TF . TF produced a shift to the left in the inhibitory dose-response curve to Al in osteoblast-like cells ; thus , DNA synthesis decreased at substantially lower media concentrations of Al in cells grown in SFM containing partially saturated Al-TF . The results indicate that TF is an important determinant of the inhibitory effect of Al on DNA synthesis by osteoblast-like cells at the micromolar levels of Al that can occur in plasma in vivo .
