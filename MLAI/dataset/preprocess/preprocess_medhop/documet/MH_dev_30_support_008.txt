P23458 / P40763 activation directly inhibits IL-12 production in dendritic cells by preventing P50750 /P-TEFb recruitment to the p35 promoter . Inhibition of Janus-activated kinase-1 ( P23458 ) is a promising clinical concept for post-transplant immunosuppression and autoimmunity . However , it also raises concerns regarding possible immunosuppressive side effects . Our study investigates P23458 signalling in the context of P29965 and bacterially activated human MoDC using siRNA and biological inhibitors . We demonstrate that strong stimuli ( e.g. intact Escherichia coli or LPS in addition to IL-1β ) induce IL-12p70 via a ROS/ Q04206 / P50750 pathway that is inhibited by simultaneous P23458 / P40763 signalling . Transcription is effective if Q04206 recruits the positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) component P50750 to a combined Q04206 / P40763 binding site -50 to -20bp upstream of the start site of the IL-12p35 promoter . P40763 simultaneously attaches to this site and inhibits P50750 binding . In the presence of IFNγ , P23458 /2 inhibitors block P42224 / P10914 / Q02556 -dependent activation and simultaneously enhance P50750 -dependent activation signals . This inverse regulation of IFNγ- vs. E. coli-induced cytokine production by JAK inhibitors including DB08877 was similarly observed for P05231 and P01375 -α production , but not for P22301 production . Thus , P23458 inhibition enhances IL-12p70 production in this context by increased DNA binding of P50750 . In contrast , weak Q04206 -activation signals ( P29965 , LPS ) depended on IFN-γ induced P42224 / P10914 / Q02556 co-signalling , which was completely blocked by JAK inhibitors as reported before . Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism of how cytokine responses to invading pathogens are separable from IFNγ-dependent autoimmunity by targeting P23458 / P40763 activation .
