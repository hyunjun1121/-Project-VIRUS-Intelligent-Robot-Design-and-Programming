Inhibitors of DB00171 -binding cassette transporters suppress interleukin-12 p40 production and major histocompatibility complex II up-regulation in macrophages . DB00171 -binding cassette ( DB01048 ) transporters are a large family of proteins whose role is to translocate various substances across biological membranes . They include the Tangier disease protein ABC1 , sulfonylurea receptors ( Q09428 ) , multidrug resistance protein ( MDR ) , and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( P13569 ) . In the current study , we investigated the involvement of ABC transporters in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and/or interferon ( IFN ) -gamma-induced interleukin ( IL ) -12 p40 and tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha production , nitric oxide formation , as well as major histocompatibility complex II up-regulation in macrophages . The general ABC transporter inhibitor glibenclamide suppressed both IL-12 p40 and nitric oxide production . However , glibenclamide failed to affect the production of P01375 . The selective ABC1 inhibitors 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and sulfobromophthalein mimicked the suppressive effect of glibenclamide on IL-12 p40 production . On the other hand , both the MDR inhibitor verapamil and P13569 blocker 2,2'-iminodibenzoic acid failed to suppress the production of IL-12 p40 . Furthermore , selective inhibitors and activators of SURs were without effect . In agreement with the pharmacological data , macrophages expressed mRNA for ABC1 , but not SURs or P13569 . Intracellular levels of IL-12 p40 were decreased by glibenclamide , suggesting that glibenclamide does not affect IL-12 p40 secretion . The effect of glibenclamide did not involve an interference with the activation of the p38 and Q8NFH3 /44 mitogen-activated protein kinases or c-Jun kinase . DB01016 also suppressed P01579 -induced up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II . Taken together , our results indicate that ABC proteins regulate LPS and/or P01579 -induced macrophage activation .
