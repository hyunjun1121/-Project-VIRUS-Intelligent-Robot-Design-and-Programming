Molecular association between ATR and two components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating complex , Q92769 and Q14839 . Q13315 ( Q13315 ) - and Rad3-related protein ( ATR ) is a phosphatidylinositol-kinase ( PIK ) -related kinase that has been implicated in the response of human cells to multiple forms of DNA damage and may play a role in the DNA replication checkpoint . The purification of an ATR complex allowed identification of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 ( Q14839 ) as an ATR-associated protein by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing . Q14839 ( also called Mi-2beta ) is a component of a histone-deacetylase-2 ( Q92769 ) -containing complex , the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating ( NRD ) complex . Endogenous ATR , Q14839 , and Q92769 are shown to coimmunoprecipitate , and ATR and Q92769 coelute through two biochemical purification steps . Other members of the NRD complex , Q13547 , Q13330 , and O94776 , are also detectable in ATR immunoprecipitates . ATR 's association with Q14839 and Q92769 suggests that there may be a linkage between ATR 's role in mediating checkpoints induced by DNA damage and chromatin modulation via remodeling and deacetylation .
