[ RAMPs and G protein coupled receptors ] . RAMPs ( receptor activity-modifying proteins ) were discovered in 1998 as accessory proteins needed to the functionnal activity of P80511 ( calcitonin gene-related peptide ) receptors . Three RAMPs generated by three different genes are known in human , rat and mice . The coding sequences of such genes are described , but as yet , regulation sequences are unknown . RAMPs interact with GPCR ( G protein-coupled receptors ) of class II . In the case of the calcitonin/ P80511 peptide family , RAMPs determine the functionnal specificity of the receptor , glycosylate and translocate the receptor to the cell surface . P80511 receptors are observed in presence of the O60894 /calcitonin receptor-like receptor ( CRLR ) , but the association of O60895 or O60896 with CRLR generates an adrenomedullin receptor . The calcitonin receptor ( CTR ) is translocated alone to the cell surface , but interactions of RAMPs with CTR forms amylin receptors . If RAMPs can interact with glucagon , parathyroid hormone and P01282 /PACAP ( vasoactive intestinal peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide ( VPACR1 ) ) receptors , the functionnal specificity of these receptors remains unaltered . However , the complex VPACR1/ O60895 enhances specifically the phosphoinoside signaling pathway .
