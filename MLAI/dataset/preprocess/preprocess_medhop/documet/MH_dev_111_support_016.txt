DB00281 inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor and suppresses proliferation of corneal epithelial cells . BACKGROUND : Although lidocaine is recognized as an excellent topical corneal analgesic , its toxic effect on corneal epithelial cells limits its use during corneal epithelial wound healing . Mechanism of the impairment of corneal reepithelialization with lidocaine , however , has not been evaluated . The authors ' previous study revealed that lidocaine inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinase receptors through the interaction with specific amino acid sequences around autophosphorylation sites , including acidic , basic , and aromatic amino acids . P00533 ( P00533 ) , a tyrosine kinase receptor with an important role in epithelial cell proliferation after corneal wounding , also possesses these amino acids sequences around autophosphorylation sites . The authors hypothesized that lidocaine would suppress tyrosine kinase activity of P00533 and would impair corneal epithelial cell proliferation . METHODS : To investigate the effect of lidocaine ( 4 microM-40 mM ) on epidermal growth factor ( P01133 ) -stimulated autophosphorylation of P00533 , the authors studied purified P00533 in microtubes . They cultured human corneal epithelial cells ( HCECs ) with P01133 and lidocaine to investigate the effect of lidocaine on cell proliferation and on autophosphorylation of P00533 in HCECs . RESULTS : DB00281 ( > or =400 microM ) significantly suppressed P01133 -stimulated autophosphorylation of the purified P00533 . In the HCEC study , P01133 alone stimulated cell proliferation and increased autophosphorylation of P00533 in HCECs . DB00281 ( > or = 400 microM ) significantly suppressed both the proliferation of HCECs promoted by P01133 and P01133 -stimulated autophosphorylation of P00533 . CONCLUSION : DB00281 directly inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of P00533 and suppresses the corneal epithelial cell proliferation .
