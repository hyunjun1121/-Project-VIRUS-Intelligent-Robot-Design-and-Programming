Flavonoids inhibit the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins by macrophages . Low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) can be oxidatively modified in vitro by macrophages and certain other cell types so that macrophages will take them up much faster . This process may be important in the formation of cholesterol-laden foam cells derived from macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions . In this study , we have shown that certain flavonoids , plant constituents found in the diet , are potent inhibitors of the modification of 125I-labelled LDL by macrophages , with IC50 values in the micromolar range ( e.g. morin and fisetin 1 microM ; quercetin and gossypetin 2 microM ) . The potencies of individual flavonoids in inhibiting LDL modification did not correlate with their previously determined potencies as inhibitors of P09917 and cyclo-oxygenase . The modification of LDL by macrophages exhibits a lag period of about 4-6 hr before enhanced uptake is detected . During this time , there is a rapid depletion in its content of DB00163 ( an endogenous antioxidant found in lipoproteins ) followed by a large increase in the level of hydroperoxides . The flavonoids conserved the DB00163 content of LDL and delayed the onset of detectable lipid peroxidation . Flavonoids also inhibited the cell-free oxidation of LDL mediated by CuSO4 . These findings raise the possibility that flavonoids may protect LDL against oxidation in atherosclerotic lesions and may therefore be natural anti-atherosclerotic components of the diet , although this will depend to a large extent on their pharmacokinetics .
