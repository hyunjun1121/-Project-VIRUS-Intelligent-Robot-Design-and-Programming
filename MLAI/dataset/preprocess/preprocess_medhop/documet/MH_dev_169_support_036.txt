A new short chain RGD-containing disintegrin , accutin , inhibits the common pathway of human platelet aggregation . A new short-chain disintegrin , accutin , was purified from the Formosan Agkistrodon acutus venom by using of gel filtration , ion exchanger and reverse phase HPLC . The homogeneous protein is a 47-residue polypeptide with a molecular mass of 5241 Da containing an DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 sequence and seven cysteinyl residues at positions highly homologous to other disintegrins . Accutin dose-dependently inhibited human platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP , collagen , thrombin or the thromboxane analogue U46619 in platelet suspension with IC50 values of 66-267 nM . It was also active in inhibiting platelet aggregation of platelet-rich plasma . However , accutin apparently did not affect the shape change caused by these agonists . Accutin also inhibited fibrinogen-induced aggregation of human elastase-treated platelets in a dose-dependent manner . Furthermore , accutin dose-dependently inhibited the binding reaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated arietin , a member of the disintegrin family , to human platelets . In addition , the binding of FITC-conjugated accutin to platelets was almost completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody , DB00054 , raised against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex . On the other hand , accutin as well as other disintegrins , rhodostomin and arietin , exhibited an inhibitory effect on 7E3 binding toward platelets and endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner . It is concluded that accutin , a new platelet aggregation inhibitor belonging to the short-chain disintegrin family , acts specifically on a binding epitope of P08514 /IIIa overlapping with that of DB00054 , leading to the blockade of fibrinogen binding to its receptor .
