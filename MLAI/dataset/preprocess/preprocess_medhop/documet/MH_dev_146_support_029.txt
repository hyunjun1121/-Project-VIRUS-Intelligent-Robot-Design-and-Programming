Levels of angiopoietins 1 and 2 in induced sputum supernatant in patients with P48444 . Pathological features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P48444 ) include lung vascular remodeling and angiogenesis . Q15389 ( Ang-1 ) , is an essential mediator of angiogenesis by establishing vascular integrity , whereas angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) acts as its natural inhibitor . We determined the levels of angiopoietins in sputum supernatants of patients with P48444 and investigated their possible association with mediators and cells involved in the inflammatory and remodeling process . Fifty-nine patients with P48444 , 25 healthy smokers and 20 healthy non-smokers were studied . All subjects underwent lung function tests , sputum induction for cell count identification and Ang-1 , Ang-2 , P15692 , TGF-Î²1 , P08253 , LTB4 , P10145 , albumin measurement in sputum supernatants . Airway vascular permeability ( AVP ) index was also assessed . Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in patients with P48444 compared to healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers [ median , interquartile ranges pg/ml , 267 ( 147-367 ) vs. 112 ( 67-171 ) and 98 ( 95-107 ) , respectively ; p < 0.001 ] . Regression analysis showed a significant association between Ang-2 levels and AVP index , P15692 , P10145 and P08253 levels in P48444 , the strongest being with P15692 . Our results indicate that induced sputum Ang-2 levels are higher in P48444 compared to healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers . Moreover , Ang-2 is associated with AVP , P10145 , P08253 , and P15692 , indicating a possible role for Ang-2 in the pathogenesis of the disease .
