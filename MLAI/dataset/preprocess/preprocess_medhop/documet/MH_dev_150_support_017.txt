Different secretion patterns of matrix metalloproteinases and P10145 and effect of corticotropin-releasing hormone in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts . The aims of the present study were to compare the levels of mRNA and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 , -3 , -8 and -9 in human cervical tissue in preterm and term labor as well as not in labor and to determine if corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) has an effect on P03956 , -3 and interleukin ( IL ) -8 secretion in both preterm and term cervical fibroblasts . Cervical biopsies were taken from 60 women : 18 at preterm labor , 7 at preterm not in labor , 18 at term labor and 17 at term not in labor . ELISA and Immulite were used for protein and real-time RT-PCR for mRNA analysis . Cervical fibroblast cultures were incubated for 18 h with different P06850 concentrations ( 10(-13)-10(-6) M ) . The mRNA expression of P03956 , -3 and -9 was higher in laboring groups compared with term not in labor . Protein levels of P22894 and -9 were higher in term in labor group compared with non-laboring groups . There were no significant differences in mRNA and protein expression between the preterm and respective term control groups . P06850 significantly increased secretion of P10145 in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts compared with controls . The secretion of P10145 and P03956 was significantly higher and P08254 secretion lower in preterm cervical fibroblasts . In conclusion , cervical ripening at preterm seems to be a similar inflammatory process as at term with P06850 involved . However , preterm and term cervical fibroblasts might have different phenotypes based on different secretion patterns of P10145 , P03956 and P08254 .
