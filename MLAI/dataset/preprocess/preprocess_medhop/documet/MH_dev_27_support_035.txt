P38936 -activated kinase ( Pak ) regulates NADPH oxidase activation in human neutrophils . The phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase plays an instrumental role in host defense and contributes to microbicial killing by releasing highly reactive oxygen species . This multicomponent enzyme is composed of membrane and cytosolic components that assemble in the plasma membrane or phagolysosome . While the guanosine S'-triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Rac2 has been shown to be a critical regulator of NADPH oxidase activity and assembly , the role of its effector , P38936 -activated kinase ( Pak ) , in oxidase function has not been well defined . Using HIV-1 Tat-mediated protein transduction of Pak inhibitory domain , we show here that Pak activity is indeed required for efficient superoxide generation in intact neutrophils . Furthermore , we show that Pak translocates to the plasma membrane upon N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( fMLF ) stimulation and colocalizes with translocated p47(phox) and with P13498 , a subunit of flavocytochrome b558 . Although activated Pak phosphorylated several essential serine residues in the C-terminus of p47phox , direct binding to p47phox was not observed . In contrast , active Pak bound directly to P13498 , suggesting flavocytochrome b was the oxidase-associated membrane target of this kinase and this association may facilitate further phosphorylation of p47phox in the assembling NADPH oxidase complex .
