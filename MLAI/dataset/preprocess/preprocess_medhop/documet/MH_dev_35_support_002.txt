Predictive factors for response to docetaxel in human breast cancers . DB01248 has come into wide use recently for the treatment of breast cancer in neoadjuvant , adjuvant and metastatic settings . DB01248 binds to beta-tubulin and causes kinetic abnormalities in the dynamics of microtubules by increasing their polymerization and inhibiting their depolymerization , resulting in elevated levels of microtubule formation . During metaphase , defective spindle formation induced by docetaxel activates the mitotic checkpoint and leads to cell cycle arrest , culminating in apoptosis . However , docetaxel is not effective for all breast cancers . For example , in metastatic settings , the response rate to docetaxel reportedly ranges from 30 to 50 % . It is therefore very important to develop a diagnostic method with high accuracy for the prediction of sensitivity to docetaxel in order to avoid unnecessary treatment . Currently it is impossible to identify , before the initiation of therapy , the patients for whom docetaxel will be effective . Various biological parameters have been studied clinically for their ability to predict response to docetaxel , such as parameters related to : ( 1 ) efflux ( p-glycoprotein ) and metabolism ( P08684 ) ; ( 2 ) beta-tubulin ( somatic mutation of beta-tubulin and changes in beta-tubulin isotypes levels ) ; ( 3 ) cell cycle ( P04626 , P38398 and Aurora-A ) ; and ( 4 ) apoptosis ( p53 , P10415 and thioredoxin ) . More recently , gene expression profiling techniques have been used for the development of a prediction model for response to docetaxel . In the present paper , clinical studies that have been conducted recently to identify predictive factors for response to docetaxel are reviewed together with a presentation of our recent work in this field .
