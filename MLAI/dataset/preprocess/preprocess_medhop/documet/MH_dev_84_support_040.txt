Oxidized LDL and lysophosphatidylcholine stimulate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression through reactive oxygen species generation and P27361 /2 activation in 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) is secreted from adipose tissue and is considered to be a risk factor for both atherosclerosis and insulin resistance . Here we report for the first time that P05121 expression is enhanced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( OxLDL ) and its lipid component lysophosphatidylcholine ( Q16549 ) in mouse 3T3- Q9NUQ9 adipocytes . In fully differentiated 3T3- Q9NUQ9 cells , OxLDL treatment increased the mRNA expression and protein secretion of P05121 in a dose- and time-dependent manner , whereas native LDL had no effect . The addition of an anti- P16671 antibody suppressed OxLDL-stimulated P05121 expression by 50 % , suggesting that adipose-derived P16671 contributes to roughly half of the P05121 expression stimulated by OxLDL . In addition , pharmacological experiments showed that the OxLDL-stimulated enhancement in P05121 expression was mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 . Furthermore , Q16549 , a major lipid component of OxLDL , was responsible for the enhanced expression of P05121 as phospholipase A(2)-treated acetyl LDL , which generates Q16549 , strongly stimulated P05121 expression , whereas acetyl LDL itself had no such activity . These data demonstrate that the uptake of OxLDL and , in particular , its lipid component Q16549 into adipocytes triggers aberrant ROS-mediated P05121 expression , which may be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome .
