DB01045 -independent interactions between the pregnane X receptor ligand binding domain and peptide fragments of coactivator and corepressor proteins . The pregnane X receptor ( O75469 ) , a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes in a ligand-dependent manner . The conventional view of nuclear receptor action is that ligand binding enhances the receptor 's affinity for coactivator proteins , while decreasing its affinity for corepressors . To date , however , no known rigorous biophysical studies have been conducted to investigate the interaction among O75469 , its coregulators , and ligands . In this work , steady-state total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) and total internal reflection with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching were used to measure the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interaction between the O75469 ligand binding domain and a peptide fragment of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 ( Q15788 ) in the presence and absence of the established O75469 agonist , rifampicin . Equilibrium dissociation and dissociation rate constants of ~5 μM and ~2 s(-1) , respectively , were obtained in the presence and absence of rifampicin , indicating that the ligand does not enhance the affinity of the O75469 and Q15788 fragments . Additionally , TIRFM was used to examine the interaction between O75469 and a peptide fragment of the corepressor protein , the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors ( Q9Y618 ) . An equilibrium dissociation constant of ~70 μM was obtained for Q9Y618 in the presence and absence of rifampicin . These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of ligand-dependent activation in O75469 differs significantly from that seen in many other nuclear receptors .
