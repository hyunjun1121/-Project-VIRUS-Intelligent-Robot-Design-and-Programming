Molecular imaging of pancreatic cancer in an animal model using targeted multifunctional nanoparticles . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Identification of a ligand/receptor system that enables functionalized nanoparticles to efficiently target pancreatic cancer holds great promise for the development of novel approaches for the detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer . DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) , a cellular receptor that is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and tumor stromal cells , is an excellent surface molecule for receptor-targeted imaging of pancreatic cancer using multifunctional nanoparticles . METHODS : The Q03405 -targeted dual-modality molecular imaging nanoparticle probe is designed and prepared by conjugating a near-infrared dye-labeled amino-terminal fragment of the receptor binding domain of urokinase plasminogen activator to the surface of functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles . RESULTS : We have shown that the systemic delivery of Q03405 -targeted nanoparticles leads to their selective accumulation within tumors of orthotopically xenografted human pancreatic cancer in nude mice . The Q03405 -targeted nanoparticle probe binds to and is subsequently internalized by Q03405 -expressing tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal cells , which facilitates the intratumoral distribution of the nanoparticles and increases the amount and retention of the nanoparticles in a tumor mass . Imaging properties of the nanoparticles enable in vivo optical and magnetic resonance imaging of Q03405 -elevated pancreatic cancer lesions . CONCLUSIONS : Targeting Q03405 using biodegradable multifunctional nanoparticles allows for the selective delivery of the nanoparticles into primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer lesions . This novel receptor-targeted nanoparticle is a potential molecular imaging agent for the detection of pancreatic cancer .
