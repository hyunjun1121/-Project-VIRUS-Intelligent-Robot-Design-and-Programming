P00747 activator inhibitor type 1 ( P05121 ) is a valuable biomarker for predicting the metabolic syndrome ( MS ) in institutionalized elderly residents in Taiwan . Circulating levels of inflammatory and prothrombotic factors are elevated in the metabolic syndrome ( MS ) and linked with the occurrence of cardiovascular events . The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between inflammatory and prothrombotic markers and the MS in elderly institutionalized residents . A total of 326 non-diabetic residents of Chuang-Hua Veterans Care Home ( age : 79.9+/-4.1 years ; 100 % males ) were enrolled . MS was diagnosed according to the DB00551 /NHLBI Scientific Statement criteria . Body fat percentage was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis . P01308 resistance was calculated by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) . Inflammatory markers , including tumor necrosis factor-a ( P01375 ) , high sensitivity P02741 ( hsCRP ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) , were determined using ELISA . Elderly residents with the MS had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures ( both p < 0.001 ) and higher HOMA-IR ( p < 0.001 ) , hsCRP ( p = 0.008 ) , and P05121 levels ( p < 0.001 ) than those without the MS . On multivariate logistic regression analysis , P05121 was an independent risk factor for the MS . Of the MS components , elderly residents with higher waist circumferences and higher levels of plasma fasting glucose , and triglyceride ( TG ) , and lower levels of high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) had higher P05121 levels than those without the above components .
