Preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of UDP-glucose-4-epimerase from Aspergillus nidulans . UDP-glucose-4-epimerase ( Q14376 ) from Aspergillus nidulans was overexpressed in Escherichia coli , purified via DB00117 -tag affinity chromatography and cocrystallized with DB03501 using the microbatch method . The crystals diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation on the Canadian Light Source 08ID-1 beamline . Examination of the data with d* O95069 revealed nonmerohedral twinning , from which a single lattice was ultimately extracted for processing . The final space group was found to be P06681 , with unit-cell parameters a = 66.13 , b = 119.15 , c = 161.42 Å , β = 98.48° . An initial structure solution has been obtained via molecular replacement employing human Q14376 ( PDB entry 1hzj ) as a template model .
