Inhibition of the lytic activity of perforin ( cytolysin ) and of late complement components by proteoglycans . The complement components ( P13671 , P10643 , Q99618 and P02748 ) implicated in the lysis of target cells and the pore-forming , lytic protein from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells , perforin , contain an amino acid sequence which is highly homologous to a repeat unit identified in the LDL-receptor ( Tschopp et al. , 1986 , Nature , 322 , 831-834 ) . The domain of the LDL-receptor , which is thought to interact with a positively charged segment of its ligands apoprotein B and E , is rich in cysteine residues and contains a cluster of negative charges . We show that the negatively charged molecules suramin and glycosaminoglycans , the positively charged peptides protamine and polylysine , all of which are known to abolish binding of LDL to its receptor ( Goldstein et al. , 1985 , A. Rev. cell. Biol. , 1 , 1-39 ) inhibit the lytic activities of P13671 , P10643 , Q99618 , P02748 and perforin . Moreover , these negatively charged molecules are potent inhibitors of cytolytic T-lymphocyte-mediated lysis of target cells , suggesting a functionally crucial role for perforin in cell-mediated cytolysis . We propose that the negatively charged , cysteine-rich domain of these complement proteins and perforin interacts with an as yet unidentified positively charged segment of its ligand in a manner analogous to the LDL- P01130 interaction . Homologous cysteine-rich domains in functionally unrelated proteins may therefore be functionally conserved as ideal rigid interaction domains with the conserved cysteine residues as framework . Specificity of the domain for its ligand would be conferred by the non-conserved amino acid residues .
