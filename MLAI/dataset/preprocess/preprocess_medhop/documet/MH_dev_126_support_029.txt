Targeting the P00533 pathway for cancer therapy . Clinical studies have shown that HER-2/Neu is over-expressed in up to one-third of patients with a variety of cancers , including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( B-ALL ) , breast cancer and lung cancer , and that these patients are frequently resistant to conventional chemo-therapies . Additionally , in most patients with multiple myeloma , the malignant cells over-express a number of epidermal growth factor receptors ( P00533 )s and their ligands , HB- P01133 and amphiregulin , thus this growth-factor family may be an important aspect in the patho-biology of this disease . These and other , related findings have provided the rationale for the targeting of the components of the P00533 signaling pathways for cancer therapy . Below we discuss various aspects of P00533 -targeted therapies mainly in hematologic malignancies , lung cancer and breast cancer . Beside novel therapeutic approaches , we also discuss specific side effects associated with the therapeutic inhibition of components of the P00533 -pathways . Alongside small inhibitors , such as DB01259 ( DB01259 , GW572016 ) , Gefitinib ( DB00317 , ZD1839 ) , and Erlotinib ( Tarceva , DB00530 ) , a significant part of the review is also dedicated to therapeutic antibodies ( e.g. : DB00072 /Herceptin , DB06366 / DB06366 /rhuMab-2C4 , Cetuximab/Erbitux/IMC-C225 , DB01269 /Abenix/ DB01269 , and also DB05294 ) . In addition , we summarize , both current therapy development driven by antibody-based targeting of the P00533 -dependent signaling pathways , and furthermore , we provide a background on the history and the development of therapeutic antibodies .
