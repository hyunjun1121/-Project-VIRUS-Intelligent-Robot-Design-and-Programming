Microelectrode measurements of the effects of basolateral adenosine in polarized human intestinal epithelial cells in culture . Activation of the basolateral receptor for adenosine in HT-29cl.19A cells , by 100 microM adenosine , increased the equivalent short-circuit current ( DeltaIsc= 24+/-2 microA/cm2 ) , depolarized the intracellular potential ( DeltaVa= 26+/-2 mV ) and decreased the fractional apical membrane resistance ( DeltafRa=-0.48 ) . The changes in all parameters reached their peak values simultaneously . This suggests that the primary action of the adenosine-activated pathway is on only one membrane . DB00887 inhibited the transepithelial response and repolarized the cell potential . After preincubation with 100 microM forskolin , application of 300 microM adenosine caused a significant further change in Va , Isc , the transepithelial potential ( Vt ) and fRa . Together with the results from ion-replacement studies , the observations indicate that adenosine activates channels other than the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) . The rank order of potencies of adenosine and adenosine analogues implies that the receptor is of the A2 subtype . Preincubation with 4-bromophenacyl bromide ( 4-BPB ) inhibited the effect of an adenosine analogue by 50 % , indicating that activation of phospholipase A2 may be involved in the adenosine-induced response .
