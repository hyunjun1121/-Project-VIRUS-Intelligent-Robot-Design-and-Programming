DB06589 for the treatment of renal cancer . INTRODUCTION : Dramatic advances in the care of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) have occurred over the last 10 years . Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease have elucidated the importance of signaling cascades related to angiogenesis in the management of RCC . DB06589 is a novel , small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFR ) -1 , -2 , and -3 ; platelet-derived growth factor receptors ( P09619 ) -α and -β ; and c-kit tyrosine kinases . DB06589 exhibits distinct pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles compared with other agents in the class of P15692 signaling pathway inhibitors . AREAS COVERED : This review discusses the scientific rationale for the development of pazopanib , as well as the preclinical and clinical trials that led to the approval of pazopanib for patients with advanced RCC . The most recent information , including data from the 2010 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the design of ongoing Phase III trials , is discussed . Finally , an algorithm utilizing level I evidence for the treatment of patients with this disease is proposed . EXPERT OPINION : The treatment of metastatic RCC has changed dramatically over the last 5 years . Six novel agents - sunitinib , sorafenib , temsirolimus , everolimus , bevacizumab ( used in combination with interferon ) , and pazopanib ( Votrient ) - have been approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC . The clinical data to date clearly place pazopanib among the most active of the targeted therapies .
