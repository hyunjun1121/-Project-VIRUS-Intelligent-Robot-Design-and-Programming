Adipocyte pseudohypoxia suppresses lipolysis and facilitates benign adipose tissue expansion . Prolyl hydroxylase enzymes ( PHDs ) sense cellular oxygen upstream of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) signaling , leading to HIF degradation in normoxic conditions . In this study , we demonstrate that adipose Q9GZT9 inhibition plays a key role in the suppression of adipocyte lipolysis . Adipose Phd2 gene ablation in mice enhanced adiposity , with a parallel increase in adipose vascularization associated with reduced circulating nonesterified fatty acid levels and normal glucose homeostasis . Phd2 gene-depleted adipocytes exhibited lower basal lipolysis in normoxia and reduced Î²-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis in both normoxia and hypoxia . A selective P20941 inhibitor suppressed lipolysis in murine and human adipocytes in vitro and in vivo in mice . Q9GZT9 genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition attenuated protein levels of the key lipolytic effectors hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase ( Q96AD5 ) , suggesting a link between adipocyte oxygen sensing and fatty acid release . Q9GZT9 mRNA levels correlated positively with mRNA levels of AB-hydrolase domain containing-5 , an activator of Q96AD5 , and negatively with mRNA levels of lipid droplet proteins , perilipin , and O60664 in human subcutaneous adipose tissue . Therapeutic pseudohypoxia caused by Q9GZT9 inhibition in adipocytes blunts lipolysis and promotes benign adipose tissue expansion and may have therapeutic applications in obesity or lipodystrophy .
