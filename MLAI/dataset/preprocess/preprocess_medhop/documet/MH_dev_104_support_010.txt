Contribution of 5- Q13049 receptor in nematode infection-induced murine intestinal smooth muscle hypercontractility . BACKGROUND & AIMS : Enteric nematode infection induces a smooth muscle hypercontractility that depends on interleukin ( IL ) -4 and P35225 activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( P35610 ) 6 . Serotonin ( 5-HT ) is involved in the physiologic regulation of gut function . The present study investigated the contribution of 5-HT and its receptors in nematode-induced intestinal smooth muscle hypercontractility . METHODS : Mice were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis ( N brasiliensis ) or Heligmosomoides polygyrus ( H polygyrus ) or injected intravenously with P35225 . Segments of jejunum were suspended in organ baths , and smooth muscle responses to 5-HT were determined in the presence or absence of specific 5-HT antagonists . P05112 , P35225 , and 5-HT receptor messenger RNA expressions were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction . RESULTS : 5-HT evoked a modest contraction of smooth muscle in wild-type ( WT ) mice that was unaltered by the 5- Q13049 antagonist ketanserin . N brasiliensis infection induced a smooth muscle hypercontractility to 5-HT that was abolished by 5-HT(2A) antagonists but not by other 5-HT antagonists . Infection-induced up-regulation of 5- Q13049 expression was correlated with the smooth muscle hypercontractility to 5-HT . The infection-induced up-regulation of 5- Q13049 in WT mice was observed also in P05112 (-/-) mice but was not seen in P35225 (-/-) or P42226 (-/-) mice . In addition , smooth muscle responses to 5-HT and 5- Q13049 expression in WT mice were also enhanced by P35225 or H polygyrus infection . CONCLUSIONS : These data show that 5- Q13049 is one of the molecules downstream from P42226 activation that mediates changes in smooth muscle function . 5- Q13049 represents a novel therapeutic target for modulating immune-mediated effects on intestinal motility .
