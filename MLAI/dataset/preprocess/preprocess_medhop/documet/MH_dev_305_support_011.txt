Up-regulation of Q13224 subunit of DB01221 receptors in cerebellar granule neurons by Ca2+/calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN93 . Recordings of DB01221 -activated currents from cerebellar granule neurons in culture revealed a developmental increase in current density accompanied by a slight decrease of the half-maximal effective concentration . At the same time , a decrease of DB01221 receptors comprising Q13224 subunits was demonstrated by the reduction in the antagonism of DB01221 currents by ifenprodil . DB08954 antagonism increased after treatment for 24 h with KN93- and KN62-selective inhibitors of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases ( P62158 kinases ) , indicating a selective increase of receptor containing Q13224 subunit . This increase was observed at all ages tested : 4 days in vitro ( DIV4 ) , DIV6 , and DIV13 . Western blot analysis with specific DB01221 receptor antibodies performed at DIV6 confirmed the electrophysiological data . At this age , the negative control KN92 was ineffective . The increasing ifenprodil antagonism after KN93 treatment was proportionally greater in cells at DIV13 than at DIV4 . Treatment with DB01221 ( 100 microM ) of cerebellar cultures for 24 h produced a decrease in the DB01221 -induced current density by almost 50 % at all ages tested . DB08954 antagonism , however , was unchanged . We propose that the expression of Q13224 subunits in cerebellar granule cells is selectively stimulated by the inhibition of P62158 kinases .
