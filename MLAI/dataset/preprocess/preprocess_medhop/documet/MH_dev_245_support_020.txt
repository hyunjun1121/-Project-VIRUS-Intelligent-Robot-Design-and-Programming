[ The dynamics of cytokines and their related substances in skin wounds ] . Molecular-pathological study on cytokines and their related substances in skin wound healing was performed from the view points of forensic pathology ; 1 . The dynamics of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) -1 alpha , P01584 , P05231 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 alpha ) during murine wound healing was examined at the levels of protein and mRNA . As for the results , the production of those inflammatory cytokines could be considered as one of the local vital reactions after wounding , and it was clarified that those inflammatory cytokines were one of the biological markers for forensic wound age determination . Practically , our immunohistochemical and morphometrical study with human skin wounds with different wound ages suggested that the ratios of P01583 -positive cells , considerably exceeding 30 % , indicated a postinfliction interval of 1 day or less . 2 . In mouse skin incision , a significant increase in P22301 mRNA occurred between 30 and 180 min . The increased expression of P22301 mRNA could be considered a vital reaction in skin wounds . Furthermore , it was clarified that P22301 may have an important regulatory role in limiting the extent and duration of inflammatory response during skin wound healing . 3 . Fas and P48023 ( Fas L ) were immunohistochemically detectable on macrophages and fibroblasts in skin wound healing process . Morphometrically , the number of cell expressing Fas and/or Fas L reached a peak at 6 days after wounding . Therefore , it is considered that apoptosis through Fas and Fas L may play an important role for reducing the cellularity during proliferative phase of wound healing in mice .
