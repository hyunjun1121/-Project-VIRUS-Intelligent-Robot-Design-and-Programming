No activation of human pregnane X receptor by hyperforin-related phloroglucinols . The acylated phloroglucinol , hyperforin , the main active ingredient of St . John 's Wort , exerts antidepressant properties via indirect inhibition of serotonin reuptake by selectively activating the canonical transient receptor potential channel 6 ( Q9Y210 ) . DB01892 treatment can lead to drug-drug interactions due to potent activation of the nuclear receptor O75469 ( O75469 ) , a key transcriptional regulator of genes involved in drug metabolism and transport . It was previously shown that synthetic acylated phloroglucinol derivatives activate Q9Y210 with similar potency as hyperforin . However , their interaction potential with O75469 remained unknown . Here we investigated five synthetic Q9Y210 -activating phloroglucinol derivatives and four Q9Y210 -nonactivating compounds compared with hyperforin and rifampicin for their potential to activate O75469 in silico and in vitro . Computational O75469 pharmacophore modeling did not indicate potent agonist or antagonist interactions for the Q9Y210 -activating derivatives , whereas one of them was suggested by docking studies to show both agonist and antagonist interactions . DB01892 and rifampicin treatment of HepG2 cells cotransfected with human O75469 expression vector and a P08684 promoter-reporter construct resulted in potent O75469 -dependent induction , whereas all Q9Y210 -activating compounds failed to show any O75469 activation or to antagonize rifampicin-mediated P08684 promoter induction . DB01892 and rifampicin treatment of primary human hepatocytes resulted in highly correlated induction of O75469 target genes , whereas treatment with the phloroglucinol derivatives elicited moderate gene expression changes that were only weakly correlated with those of rifampicin and hyperforin treatment . These results show that Q9Y210 -activating phloroglucinols do not activate O75469 and should therefore be promising new candidates for further drug development .
