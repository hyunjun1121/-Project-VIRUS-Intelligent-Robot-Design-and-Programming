Reversible lipidization prolongs the pharmacological effect , plasma duration , and liver retention of octreotide . PURPOSE : DB00104 ( O75051 ) was reversibly lipidized to improve the pharmacological effect and to increase the plasma half-life and the liver retention of O75051 for greater therapeutic potential in the treatment of liver cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma . METHODS : O75051 was chemically modified using reversible aqueous lipidization ( REAL ) technology . REAL-modified O75051 ( REAL- O75051 ) was characterized with high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry . A single dose of O75051 or REAL- O75051 or vehicle only was subcutaneously administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats , and the plasma growth hormone ( GH ) levels were measured after an intravenous injection of 2.5 microg/kg of growth hormone releasing factor ( P01286 ) to assess the ability of REAL- O75051 on GH inhibition . Radio-iodinated Tyr3- O75051 ( TOC ) and REAL-TOC were used for pharmacokinetic studies . RESULTS : At 0.1 mg/kg , REAL- O75051 inhibited the P01286 -induced GH surge in rats for a greater than 24-h period in comparison to the 6-h period for O75051 . The distribution and elimination half-life for 125I-REAL-TOC were 1.4 h and 6.6 h , respectively , which were significantly longer than those of 125I-TOC . Sustained high blood concentrations and reduced in vivo degradation were observed for 125I-REAL-TOC . In addition , 125I-REAL-TOC appeared to be targeted to the liver with persistent high liver retention . CONCLUSIONS : REAL- O75051 has a significantly enhanced pharmacological effect , and this is most likely due to the favorable changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters upon lipidization . The observed liver targeting effect of REAL-TOC suggests that REAL- O75051 might be advantageous over O75051 in treating liver cancers .
