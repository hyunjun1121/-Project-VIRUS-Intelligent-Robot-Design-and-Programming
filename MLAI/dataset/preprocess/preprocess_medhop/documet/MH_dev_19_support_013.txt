O95760 augments DB05875 -induced P15692 secretion from human mast cells and is increased in psoriatic skin . The peptide DB05875 ( SP ) has been implicated in inflammatory conditions , such as psoriasis , where mast cells and P15692 are increased . A relationship between SP and P15692 has not been well studied , nor has any interaction with the proinflammatory cytokines , especially O95760 . Here we report that SP ( 0.1-10 microM ) induces gene expression and secretion of P15692 from human LAD2 mast cells and human umbilical core blood-derived cultured mast cells ( hCBMCs ) . This effect is significantly increased by coadministration of O95760 ( 5-100 ng/mL ) in both cell types . The effect of SP on P15692 release is inhibited by treatment with the P25103 antagonist 733,060 . SP rapidly increases cytosolic calcium , and so does O95760 to a smaller extent ; the addition of O95760 augments the calcium increase . SP-induced P15692 production involves calcium-dependent PKC isoforms , as well as the P29323 and JNK MAPKs . Gene expression of O95760 and histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ) , an indicator of mast cell presence/activation , is significantly increased in affected and unaffected ( at least 15 cm away from the lesion ) psoriatic skin , as compared with normal control skin . Immunohistochemistry indicates that O95760 is associated with endothelial cells in both the unaffected and affected sites , but is stronger and also associated with immune cells in the affected site . These results imply that functional interactions among SP , O95760 , and mast cells leading to P15692 release contribute to inflammatory conditions , such as the psoriasis , a nonallergic hyperproliferative skin inflammatory disorder with a neurogenic component .
