Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in cellular viral receptors and attachment factor-related genes and humoral immunity to rubella vaccination . BACKGROUND : Viral attachment and cell entry host factors are important for viral replication , pathogenesis , and the generation and sustenance of immune responses after infection and/or vaccination , and are plausible genetic regulators of vaccine-induced immunity . METHODS : Using a tag-SNP approach in candidate gene study , we assessed the role of selected cell surface receptor genes , attachment factor-related genes , along with other immune genes in the genetic control of immune response variations after live rubella vaccination in two independent study cohorts . RESULTS : Our analysis revealed evidence for multiple associations between genetic variants in the P15151 , Q92692 , Q9NNX6 / Q9NNX6 , P10826 , Q16653 , P05231 and other immune function-related genes and rubella-specific neutralizing antibodies after vaccination ( meta p-value < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : Our results indicate that multiple SNPs from genes involved in cell adhesion , viral attachment , and viral entry , as well as others in genes involved in signaling and/or immune response regulation , play a role in modulating humoral immune responses following live rubella vaccination .
