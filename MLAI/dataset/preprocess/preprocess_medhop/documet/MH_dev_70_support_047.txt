In silico design : extended molecular dynamic simulations of a new series of dually acting inhibitors against P00533 and P04626 . Based on the hit structures that have been identified in our previous studies against P00533 and P04626 , new potential inhibitors that share the same scaffold of the hit structures are designed and screened in silico . Insights into understanding the potential inhibitory effect of the new inhibitors against both P00533 and P04626 receptors is obtained using extended molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations and different scoring techniques . The binding mechanisms and dynamics are detailed with respect to two approved inhibitors against P00533 ( lapatinib ) and P04626 ( SYR127063 ) . The best scoring inhibitor ( P02786 ) is chosen for additional in silico investigation against both the wild-type and T790M mutant strain of P00533 and the wild-type P04626 . The results reveal that certain substitution patterns increase the stability and assure stronger binding and higher H-bond occupancy of the conserved water molecule that is commonly observed with kinase crystal structures . Furthermore , the new inhibitor ( P02786 ) forms stable interactions with the mutant strain as a direct consequence of the enhanced ability to form additional hydrogen bonding interactions with binding site residues .
