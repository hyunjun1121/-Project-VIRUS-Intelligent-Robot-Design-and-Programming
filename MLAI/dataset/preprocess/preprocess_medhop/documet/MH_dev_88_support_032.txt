Long-term treatment of acromegalic patients resistant to somatostatin analogues with the P10912 antagonist pegvisomant : its efficacy in relation to gender and previous radiotherapy . CONTEXT : DB00082 is an effective treatment for somatostatin analogue-resistant acromegaly , but the determinants defining the response to this treatment are largely unknown . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the efficacy of pegvisomant treatment in resistant acromegalic patients ( e.g. serum IGF1 at least 1.25 x upper normal limit ) in a clinical setting and the factors conditioning this response . DESIGN AND SETTING : A retrospective cross-sectional study performed in six Spanish University hospitals from 2004 to 2007 . Patients Forty-four acromegalic patients ( 61.4 % female , mean age : 49+/-14 ) , 95 % of whom had undergone pituitary surgery and 61 % having received pituitary radiotherapy . The mean follow-up was 22.7+/-11.2 months . Main outcome measures IGF1 levels reflected treatment efficacy , and the influence of gender , age , weight , previous radiotherapy and duration of treatment was assessed . RESULTS : IGF1 normalisation was achieved in 84 % of the patients . Male gender ( P < 0.05 ) , previous irradiation ( P < 0.05 ) and the treatment duration ( r=0.364 , P < 0.02 ) were associated with a better response to pegvisomant therapy . There was a significant decrease in HbA1c ( P < 0.001 ) and in the mean insulin dose ( P < 0.01 ) in acromegalic diabetic patients . Although 25 % of patients experienced mild adverse events , pegvisomant was only withdrawn in four patients due to side effects ( two cases of tumour growth , one liver dysfunction and one headache ) . CONCLUSIONS : Long-term pegvisomant is a very effective therapy in resistant acromegaly . Male gender and prior radiotherapy influence the therapeutic response rate .
