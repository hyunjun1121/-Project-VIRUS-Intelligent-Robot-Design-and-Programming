Clonal analysis and hierarchy of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells . OBJECTIVE : This study was performed to assess adult human bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells at a single-cell level and to determine a hierarchy based on proliferative potential . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Adult bone marrow mesenchymal cells expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) were sorted as single cells into 24-well plates , each well confirmed with single EGFP-positive cells by fluorescence microscopy , and counted every 3 days . Colonies derived from single cells were expanded then sorted and evaluated using established differentiation protocols for adipogenic , chondrogenic , and osteogenic lineages . Cells were further analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) ( peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor[ Q07869 ]-gamma2 , P41159 , P06858 , P51884 , P49747 , BIG , Q13950 , P21815 , P02818 ) and immunocytochemistry ( Q07869 -gamma1/2 , collagen II , bone sialoprotein II ) specific for trilineage differentiation . RESULTS : Bone marrow mesenchymal cells were found to contain high proliferative potential ( HPP ) mesenchymal colony-forming cells ( MCFC ) ( 7 % ) , low proliferative potential ( Q93052 ) MCFC ( 29 % ) , mesenchymal cell clusters ( MCC , 26 % ) , and mature mesenchymal cells ( DB00305 , 38 % ) . All Q93052 -MCFC , MCC , and DB00305 colonies reached senescence at the end of the evaluation period . However , HPP-MCFC continued to grow , showed differentiation toward all three lineages , and demonstrated the capacity to give rise to secondary HPP-MCFC upon replating at a clonal level . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that there is a low frequency of bone marrow-derived HPP-MCFC that can both self-renew at a single-cell level and differentiate toward multiple lineages of mesenchymal origin .
