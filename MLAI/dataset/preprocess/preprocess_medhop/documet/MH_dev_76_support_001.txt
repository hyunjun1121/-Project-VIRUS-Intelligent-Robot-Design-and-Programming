DB01012 HCl prevents development of parathyroid gland hyperplasia and reverses established parathyroid gland hyperplasia in a rodent model of CKD . BACKGROUND : Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( sHPT ) represents an adaptive response to progressively impaired control of calcium , phosphorus and vitamin D in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . It is characterized by parathyroid hyperplasia and excessive synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . Parathyroid hyperplasia in uremic rats can be prevented by calcium-sensing receptor ( P41180 ) activation with the calcimimetic cinacalcet ( Sensipar®/Mimpara® ) ; however , it is unknown , how long the effects of cinacalcet persist after withdrawal of treatment or if cinacalcet is efficacious in uremic rats with established sHPT . METHODS : We sought to determine the effect of cinacalcet discontinuation in uremic rats and whether cinacalcet was capable of influencing parathyroid hyperplasia in animals with established sHPT . RESULTS : Discontinuation of cinacalcet resulted in reversal of the beneficial effects on serum PTH and parathyroid hyperplasia . In rats with established sHPT , cinacalcet decreased serum PTH and mediated regression of parathyroid hyperplasia . The cinacalcet-mediated decrease in parathyroid gland size was accompanied by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P38936 . Prevention of cellular proliferation with cinacalcet occurred despite increased serum phosphorus and decreased serum calcium . CONCLUSIONS : The animal data provided suggest established parathyroid hyperplasia can be reversed by modulating P41180 activity with cinacalcet and that continued treatment may be necessary to maintain reductions in PTH .
