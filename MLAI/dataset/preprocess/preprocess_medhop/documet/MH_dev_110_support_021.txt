Positive interaction between lapatinib and capecitabine in human breast cancer models : study of molecular determinants . The combination of lapatinib and capecitabine is approved in Her2+ metastatic breast cancer . However , the pharmacological mechanisms for this association have not been fully elucidated . In this non-clinical study , we evaluated the efficacy of this association on a panel of six human breast cancer cell lines as a means to identify the molecular determinants of response to this combination . Cell viability was evaluated after concomitant/sequential exposure , and response/resistance determinants for each drug such as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( Q12882 ) , thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , thymidine phosphorylase , Bax , Bcl2 , P21 levels , and phospho Q8NFH3 /44 and P00533 /2 signaling pathway were studied . DB01259 proved to markedly downregulate TS activity , thus suggesting a subsequent better efficacy of capecitabine . DB01101 optimized the downregulation of p-AKT and p-P42/44 expression by lapatinib . Consequently , we observed an increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and P38936 protein expression in cells exposed to the combination . Overall , our data showed that whatever the schedule and the cell line were , additive to synergistic interaction was achieved in our models . The optimal in vitro combination was finally tested in tumor-bearing mice . Our results fully confirmed that associating both drugs led to a 77 % reduction in tumor growth as compared with control animals in BT474-xenografted models . Taken together , this non-clinical study shows that lapatinib and capecitabine modulate each other 's molecular determinants of response and that concomitant dosing seems to be the optimal way to combine these drugs . Besides , modulation of TS expression by lapatinib makes its association with capecitabine a promising way to overcome breast cancers resistant in relation with TS overexpression .
