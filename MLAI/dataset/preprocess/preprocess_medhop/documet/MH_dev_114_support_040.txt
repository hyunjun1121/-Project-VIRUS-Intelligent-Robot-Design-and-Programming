Possible mode of action of DB00244 . Despite the extensive use of sulfasalazine ( SAS ) and/or DB00244 ( DB00244 ) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and , more recently , rheumatoid arthritis , their mode of action has not been elucidated so far . None of the numerous pharmacological and biochemical effects described , including immunosuppressive , antifolate , and modulatory actions on lymphocyte and leukocyte functions , could be defined unequivocally as mediating their beneficial activity . Recently , interest has focused on actions of SAS and DB00244 on the various enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade . Mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease generates excessive amounts of cyclooxygenase products such as prostaglandins ( PG ) as well as P09917 products such as leukotriene ( LT ) B4 and sulfidopeptide-LT . Both PG and LT exert proinflammatory actions and are potentially important mediators of mucosal inflammation . SAS and DB00244 , however , have been found to inhibit PG synthesis under certain experimental conditions only , while increasing PG formation under other conditions . While SAS was found to inhibit colonic LTB4 synthesis , DB00244 was reported to selectively affect the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonate metabolism in this tissue . Our results demonstrate that , like the parent compound , the metabolite DB00244 in a dose-dependent manner inhibits release of LTB4 and sulfidopeptide-LT from normal human colonic mucosa ( IC50 3.5 and 3.7 mmol/liter , respectively ) . Indomethacin , which has no efficacy in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease , on the other hand , selectively inhibited DB00917 formation in normal and inflamed colonic mucosa ( IC50 1.7 and 1.0 mmol/liter , respectively ) without reducing synthesis of LTB4 or sulfidopeptide-LT.
