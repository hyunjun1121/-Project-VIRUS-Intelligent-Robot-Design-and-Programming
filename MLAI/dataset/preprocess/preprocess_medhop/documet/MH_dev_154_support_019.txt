Investigation of the binding of isoform-selective inhibitors to prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases using fluorescence spectroscopy . Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ( PGHS ) is a heme protein that catalyzes the committed step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis . Two isoforms of PGHS exist , a constitutive form termed P23219 and an inducible form termed P35354 . We report here fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of isoform-selective inhibitors interacting with P23219 and P35354 . By measuring fluorescence quenching due to the energy transfer of the inhibitor fluorescence to the heme prosthetic group of PGHS , we determined these inhibitors bind in the arachidonic acid substrate access channel with an R0 of 35 A for P23219 with the P23219 inhibitor and an R0 of 21 A for P35354 with the P35354 inhibitor . The observed fluorescence quenching is completely dynamic and dominated by quenching by the heme . Time-resolved results combined with molecular modeling determine the distance from the inhibitor to the heme moiety to be 20 A in P23219 and 18 A in P35354 . Preliminary stopped-flow kinetic studies reveal that the rate of quenching is limited by a first-order protein transition , which is slow , and that bound inhibitor undergoes rapid exchange .
