Incorporating age at onset of smoking into genetic models for nicotine dependence : evidence for interaction with multiple genes . DB00184 dependence is moderately heritable , but identified genetic associations explain only modest portions of this heritability . We analyzed 3369 SNPs from 349 candidate genes and investigated whether incorporation of SNP-by-environment interaction into association analyses might bolster gene discovery efforts and prediction of nicotine dependence . Specifically , we incorporated the interaction between allele count and age at onset of regular smoking ( AOS ) into association analyses of nicotine dependence . Subjects were from the Collaborative Genetic Study of DB00184 Dependence and included 797 cases ascertained for Fagerstr√∂m nicotine dependence and 811 non-nicotine-dependent smokers as controls , all of European descent . Compared with main effect models , SNP x AOS interaction models resulted in higher numbers of nominally significant tests , increased predictive utility at individual SNPs and higher predictive utility in a multi-locus model . Some SNPs previously documented in main effect analyses exhibited improved fits in the joint analysis , including rs16969968 from P30532 and rs2314379 from Q9Y6R4 . P30532 exhibited larger effects in later-onset smokers , in contrast with a previous report that suggested the opposite interaction ( Weiss et al. 2008 ) . However , a number of SNPs that did not emerge in main effect analyses were among the strongest findings in the interaction analyses . These include SNPs located in Q13224 ( P = 1.5 x 10(-5) ) , which encodes a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel , a key molecule in mediating age-dependent synaptic plasticity . Incorporation of logically chosen interaction parameters , such as AOS , into genetic models of substance use disorders may increase the degree of explained phenotypic variation and constitutes a promising avenue for gene discovery .
