DB01076 inhibits inflammatory angiogenesis in mice through down regulation of P15692 , P01375 and TGF-beta1 . While compelling evidence indicates beneficial effects of statins on inflammatory processes , besides their cholesterol-lowering activities , the actions on angiogenesis are less clear-cut . Our aim was to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on key components of inflammatory angiogenesis in the murine sponge model . Polyester-polyurethane sponges , used as a framework for fibrovascular tissue growth , were implanted in Swiss mice . DB01076 ( 0.6 , 3 mg/kg/day ) was given orally for 8 days in drinking water . The implants collected at day 9 postimplantation were processed for the assessment of hemoglobin , myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) , N-acetylglucosaminidase ( NAG ) and collagen . Relevant inflammatory , angiogenic and fibrogenic cytokines were also determined . DB01076 treatment resulted in significant decrease in sponge vascularization ( Hb content ) and in P15692 levels at both doses . Neutrophil influx ( P05164 activity ) was not affected by the compound whereas macrophage recruitment ( NAG activity ) was inhibited , suggesting a degree of selectivity by atorvastatin for this cell population . The level of P13500 ( MCP1-JE ) was decreased only with 0.6 mg/kg . DB01076 was also able to reduce collagen deposition and the levels of transforming growth factor ( TGF-beta1 ) intraimplant , dose-dependently . The inhibitory function of atorvastatin on multiple parameters of main components of inflammatory angiogenesis revealed in this study is clearly associated with the modulatory effects of P04035 on P15692 , P01375 and TGF-beta1 production .
