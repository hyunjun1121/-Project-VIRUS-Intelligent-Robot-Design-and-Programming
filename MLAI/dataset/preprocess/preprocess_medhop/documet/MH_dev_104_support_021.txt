miRNA signature and Dicer requirement during human endometrial stromal decidualization in vitro . Decidualization is a morphological and biochemical transformation of endometrial stromal fibroblast into differentiated decidual cells , which is critical for embryo implantation and pregnancy establishment . The complex regulatory networks have been elucidated at both the transcriptome and the proteome levels , however very little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of this process . miRNAs regulate multiple physiological pathways and their de-regulation is associated with human disorders including gynaecological conditions such as endometriosis and preeclampsia . In this study we profile the miRNAs expression throughout human endometrial stromal ( hESCs ) decidualization and analyze the requirement of the miRNA biogenesis enzyme Dicer during this process . A total of 26 miRNAs were upregulated and 17 miRNAs downregulated in decidualized hESCs compared to non-decidualized hESCs . Three miRNAs families , miR-181 , miR-183 and miR-200 , are down-regulated during the decidualization process . Using miRNAs target prediction algorithms we have identified the potential targets and pathways regulated by these miRNAs . The knockdown of Dicer has a minor effect on hESCs during in vitro decidualization . We have analyzed a battery of decidualization markers such as cell morphology , P01236 , P08833 , P55773 and P35625 secretion as well as P31260 , P35354 , SP1 , C/EBPÃŸ and Q12778 expression in decidualized hESCs with decreased Dicer function . We found decreased levels of P31260 and altered intracellular organization of actin filaments in Dicer knockdown decidualized hESCs compared to control . Our results provide the miRNA signature of hESC during the decidualization process in vitro . We also provide the first functional characterization of Dicer during human endometrial decidualization although surprisingly we found that Dicer plays a minor role regulating this process suggesting that alternative biogenesis miRNAs pathways must be involved in human endometrial decidualization .
