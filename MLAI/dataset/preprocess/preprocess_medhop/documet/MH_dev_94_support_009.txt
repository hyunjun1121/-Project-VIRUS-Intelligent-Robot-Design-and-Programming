Regulation and functional consequences of ADP receptor-mediated P28482 activation in platelets . We have previously shown that ADP-induced thromboxane generation in platelets requires signalling events from the G(q)-coupled P47900 receptor ( platelet ADP receptor coupled to stimulation of phospholipase C ) and the G(i)-coupled Q9H244 receptor ( platelet ADP receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase ) in addition to outside-in signalling . While it is also known that extracellular calcium negatively regulates ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation , the underlying mechanism remains unclear . In the present study we sought to elucidate the signalling mechanisms and regulation by extracellular calcium of ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation in platelets . P29323 ( extracllular-signal-regulated kinase ) 2 activation occurred when outside-in signalling was blocked , indicating that it is a downstream event from the P2Y receptors . However , blockade of either P47900 or the Q9H244 receptors with corresponding antagonists completely abolished P29323 phosphorylation , indicating that both P2Y receptors are required for ADP-induced P29323 activation . Inhibitors of Src family kinases or the P29323 upstream kinase MEK [ MAPK ( mitogen-activated protein kinase ) / P29323 kinase ] abrogated ADP-induced P29323 phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 generation . Finally ADP- or G(i)+G(z)-induced P29323 phosphorylation was blocked in the presence of extracellular calcium . The present studies show that P28482 is activated downstream of P2Y receptors through a complex mechanism involving Src kinases and this plays an important role in ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation . We also conclude that extracellular calcium blocks ADP-induced thromboxane A2 generation through the inhibition of P29323 activation .
