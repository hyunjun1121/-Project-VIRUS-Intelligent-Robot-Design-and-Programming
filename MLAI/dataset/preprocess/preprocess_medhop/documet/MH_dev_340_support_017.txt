DB06603 synergizes with bortezomib to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation in renal cancer cells . BACKGROUND : Inducing endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress is a novel strategy used to treat malignancies . Inhibition of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 6 by the HDAC inhibitor DB06603 hinders the refolding of unfolded proteins by increasing the acetylation of heat shock protein 90 . We investigated whether combining DB06603 with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib would kill cancer cells effectively by inhibiting the degradation of these unfolded proteins , thereby causing ubiquitinated proteins to accumulate and induce ER stress . METHODS : Caki-1 , ACHN , and 769-P cells were treated with DB06603 and/or bortezomib . Cell viability , clonogenicity , and induction of apoptosis were evaluated . The in vivo efficacy of the combination was evaluated using a murine subcutaneous xenograft model . The combination-induced ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation were assessed . RESULTS : The combination of DB06603 and bortezomib induced apoptosis and inhibited renal cancer growth synergistically ( combination indexes < 1 ) . It also suppressed colony formation significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . In a murine subcutaneous tumor model , a 10-day treatment was well tolerated and inhibited tumor growth significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . Enhanced acetylation of the Q9UBN7 substrate alpha-tubulin was consistent with the suppression of Q9UBN7 activity by DB06603 , and the combination was shown to induce ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation synergistically . CONCLUSIONS : DB06603 inhibits renal cancer growth by synergizing with bortezomib to induce ER stress and ubiquitinated protein accumulation . The current study provides a basis for testing the combination in patients with advanced renal cancer .
