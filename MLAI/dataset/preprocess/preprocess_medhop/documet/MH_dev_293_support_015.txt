Regulation of P28074 protein and β subunits of mammalian proteasome by constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) : potential role in bortezomib-mediated anticancer therapy . The ubiquitin-proteasome system facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins and performs a regulatory role in cells . Elevated proteasome activity and subunit expression are found in several cancers . However , the inherent molecular mechanisms responsible for increased proteasome function in cancers remain unclear despite the well investigated and defined role of the mammalian proteasome . This study was initiated to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of β subunits of the mammalian proteasome . Suppression of P40763 tyrosine phosphorylation coordinately decreased the mRNA and protein levels of the β subunits of the 20 S core complex in DU145 cells . Notably , P28074 , a molecular target of bortezomib , was shown to be a target of P40763 . Knockdown of P40763 decreased P28074 protein . Inhibition of phospho- P40763 substantially reduced P28074 protein levels in cells expressing constitutively active- P40763 . Accumulation of activated P40763 resulted in the induction of P28074 promoter and protein levels . In addition , a direct correlation was observed between the endogenous levels of P28074 and constitutively active P40763 . P28074 and P40763 protein levels remained unaltered following the inhibition of proteasome activity . The P01133 -induced concerted increase of β subunits was blocked by inhibition of the P01133 receptor or P40763 but not by the PI3K/AKT or MEK/ P29323 pathways . Decreased proteasome activities were due to reduced protein levels of catalytic subunits of the proteasome in P40763 -inhibited cells . Combined treatments with bortezomib and inhibitor of P40763 abrogated proteasome activity and enhanced cellular apoptosis . Overall , we demonstrate that aberrant activation of P40763 regulates the expression of β subunits , in particular P28074 , and the catalytic activity of the proteasome .
