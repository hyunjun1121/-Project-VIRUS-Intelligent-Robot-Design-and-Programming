DB06155 inhibits proliferation , collagen secretion and induces apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells . BACKGROUND/AIMS : Liver fibrosis represents a significant health problem worldwide . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) play a critical role in the live fibrosis . DB06155 ( SR141716 ) is cannabinoid receptor type 1 ( P21554 ) antagonist . The pharmacological effects of rimonabant on HSCs are not well characterized in HSCs . METHODS : P21554 receptor was detected by immunohistochemistry in human liver fibrosis specimens . Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay . Cell apoptosis , caspase-3 protein expression and cell cycle were detected by TEM and flow cytometry , respectively . P42574 activity was measured using caspase-3 activity assay kit . Collagen secretion was evaluated by radioimmunoassay . P21554 receptor and signaling molecules were evaluated by qRTPCR and Western blot . RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry showed a discrete , punctuated P21554 immunoreactivity in human liver fibrosis specimens . DB06155 reduced P19526 proliferation and increased P19526 apoptosis . Cell cycle analysis showed a decrease in G2/M phase cells and an increase in G0/ P55008 phase cells in P19526 - Q8NHM4 cells treated with rimonabant . P42574 protein expression and activity were increased by rimonabant . DB06155 decreased collagen secretion in P19526 - Q8NHM4 cells . Moreover , rimonabant inhibited the expression of phosphorylated Q05397 and P29323 and down-regulated P21554 mRNA expression . CONCLUSION : The study provides new insights toward the pharmacological effect of rimonabant on HSCs in vitro . DB06155 inhibits proliferation , collagen secretion and induces apoptosis in HSCs .
