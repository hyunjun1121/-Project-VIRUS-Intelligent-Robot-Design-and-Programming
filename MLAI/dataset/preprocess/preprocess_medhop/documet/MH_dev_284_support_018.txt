DB05822 , a nitric oxide-releasing aspirin derivative , exhibits a significant antiproliferative effect and alters cell cycle progression in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines . DB00435 -releasing non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NO-NSAIDs ) are safer than NSAIDs due to their ability to reduce gastric toxicity . We assessed the cytotoxic activity of a new aspirin derivative , DB05822 , after different exposure schedules , in three human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines . All the lines were positive for P23219 protein and mRNA , as evaluated by Western blot and RT-PCR , respectively , while only one was positive for P35354 . The cytostatic and cytocidal activity was determined by sulforhodamine B assay and evaluated according to Monks ' model . Cytostatic activity was observed after a 24-h drug exposure and 50 % growth inhibition was reached at concentrations ranging from 165 to 250 micro M in all cell lines , whereas with aspirin the IC50 was never reached , even at the maximum concentration tested ( 500 micro M ) , and was independent of P23219 or P35354 status . Cytocidal activity was observed only at the highest concentrations and persisted for a long time after drug removal . Flow cytometric analysis showed that the NO-aspirin compound induced a persistent accumulation of cells in G2-M phase in all the cell lines after at least 48 h exposure . Specifically , the block pertained mainly to G2 phase , whereas mitotic index was not affected at all . Our results indicate that DB05822 has an in vitro cytostatic activity superior to that of its parental aspirin compound , which makes it a potentially important tumor preventive agent . Furthermore , the cytocidal effect observed at the highest concentrations and the induction of a specific block in G2 phase renders it a promising candidate for drug combination treatments .
