DB01281 inhibits effector T cells through regulatory T cells and TGF-β . The P10747 costimulatory receptor is a critical regulator of T cell function , making it an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases . DB01281 , now approved for use in humans , prevents naive T cell activation by binding to P33681 proteins and blocking engagement of P10747 . However , DB01281 suppresses inflammation even if administered when disease is established , suggesting alternative mechanisms . We identified a novel , P10747 -independent mechanism by which DB01281 inhibits activated T cells . We show that in vitro , DB01281 synergizes with NO from bone marrow-derived macrophages to inhibit T cell proliferation . Depletion of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) or interference with TGF-β signaling abrogated the inhibitory effect of DB01281 . Parallel in vivo experiments using an allergic airway inflammation model demonstrated that this novel mechanism required both macrophages and regulatory T cells . Furthermore , DB01281 was ineffective in P84022 -deficient mice , supporting a requirement for TGF-β signaling . Thus , in addition to preventing naive T cells from being fully activated , DB01281 can turn off already activated effector T cells by an NO/regulatory T cell/TGF-β-dependent pathway . This mechanism is similar to cell-extrinsic effects of endogenous P16410 and may be particularly important in the ability of DB01281 to treat chronic inflammatory disease .
