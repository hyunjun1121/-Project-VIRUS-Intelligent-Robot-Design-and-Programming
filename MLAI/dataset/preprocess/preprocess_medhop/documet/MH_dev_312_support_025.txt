Expression of P20839 is regulated in response to mycophenolate concentration . DB04335 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) catalyzes de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis . DB01024 ( DB00603 ) exerts immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting IMPDH . The aim of this study was to investigate gene expressions of two IMPDH isoforms , during in vivo exposure to DB00603 . Healthy volunteers ( n=5 ) were given single doses of 100 , 250 , 500 and 1000 mg mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ) . Blood was sampled pre-dose and at 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 24 h post-dose . The expressions of P20839 and 2 were quantified in P01730 + cells and whole blood by real-time reverse transcription-PCR . Following DB00688 doses of 500 mg , the expression of P20839 and 2 in P01730 + cells was reduced 39 % ( P=0.043 ) and 10 % ( P=0.043 ) , respectively . Smaller reductions ( ns ) were observed after 1000 mg DB00688 . Similar trends were demonstrated for whole blood . The largest reductions of P20839 occurred at DB00603 AUC ( 0-12 h ) of 20 mg h/L . Below this , increasing DB00603 exposure correlated with larger reductions of P20839 expression ( P01730 + cells : r=-0.82 , P < 0.001 , and whole blood : r=-0.50 , P=0.04 , n=17 ) , while higher DB00603 exposure seemed to be associated with smaller reductions of expression ( P01730 + cells : r=0.42 , ns , and whole blood : r=0.77 , P=0.039 , n=8 ) . The concentration-dependent modulation of P20839 and 2 expressions by DB00603 might impact IMPDH activity . Knowledge of the regulation of the two IMPDH isoenzymes in vivo by DB00603 is of importance considering pharmacodynamic monitoring and optimization of DB00603 treatment .
