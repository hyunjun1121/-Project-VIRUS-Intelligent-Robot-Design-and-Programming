High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin do not affect the recognition phase of the classical complement pathway . We have recently found that intravenous immunoglobulin ( DB00028 ) prevents deposition of P01024 and C4 fragments onto antibody sensitized erythrocytes . To find out if such an effect results from the blockade of the recognition phase of the classical complement cascade , we investigated the ability of human serum containing high concentrations of DB00028 to deposit the recognition subunit of the first complement component ( C1q ) onto targets . Normal human serum supplemented in vitro with DB00028 did not demonstrate reduced C1q binding to targets as determined by radiolabeled antihuman C1q antibody uptake . Similarly , methylamine-treated normal human serum to which DB00028 was added was equally effective in terms of C1q binding as the same serum without DB00028 . At increasing doses of sensitizing antibody , C1q uptake decreased proportionally ; however , at all antibody dilution points C1q uptake was not significantly different in the serum with DB00028 in comparison with normal serum . Serum from a patient treated with DB00028 did not differ in its capacity to deposit C1q from the same patient 's serum before therapy . Our data suggest that DB00028 does not interfere with the recognition step of classical complement pathway . This is a US government work . There are no restrictions on its use .
