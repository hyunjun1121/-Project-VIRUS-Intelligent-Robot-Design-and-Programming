Lactobacillus protects the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier damaged by pathogenic bacteria . Pathogens invade intestinal mucosal barrier through phagocytosis of antigen presenting cells ( dendritic cell , microfold cells ) , or through the invasion into the intestinal epithelial directly . Some pathogens could damage the cell junction between epithelial cells and use the paracellular pathway as an entrance to invade . Moreover , some Lactobacillus could inhibit the adhesion of the pathogens and protect the integrity of the cell junction and mucosal barrier . This research focused on the potential therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus fructosus ( L. fructosus ) P06681 to attenuate ETEC K88 or S. typhimurium SL1344 induced changes to mucosal barrier . The results demonstrated that treatment of polarized Caco-2 cells with L. fructosus P06681 reduced the permeation of dextran , and expression of P10145 , p- P29323 , and p-JNK when cells were infected with pathogenic bacteria . The findings indicated that L. fructosus P06681 exerted a protective effect against the damage to the integrity of Caco-2 cells by ETEC or S. typhimurium infection .
