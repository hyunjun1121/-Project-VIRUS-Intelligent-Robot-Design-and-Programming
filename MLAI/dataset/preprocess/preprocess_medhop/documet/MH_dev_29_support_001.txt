Inhibitory effects of vinpocetine on the progression of atherosclerosis are mediated by Akt/NF-κB dependent mechanisms in apoE-/- mice . BACKGROUND : Recent studies have found additional roles for vinpocetine , a potent phosphodiesterase type I inhibitor , in anti-proliferation and anti-inflammation of vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cells via different mechanisms . In this study , we attempted to investigate whether vinpocetine protected against atherosclerotic development in apoE(-/-) mice and explore the underlying anti-atherogenic mechanisms in macrophages . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Vinpocetine markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion size in apoE(-/-) mice measured by oil red O . Masson 's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that vinpocetine significantly increased the thickness of fibrous cap , reduced the size of lipid-rich necrotic core and attenuated inflammation . In vitro experiments exhibited a significant decrease in monocyte adhesion treated with vinpocetine . Further , active P01375 -α , P05231 , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression induced by ox-LDL were attenuated by vinpocetine in a dose-dependent manner . Similarly , ox-LDL-induced reactive oxygen species were significantly repressed by vinpocetine . Both western blot and luciferase activity assay showed that vinpocetine inhibited the enhanced Akt , IKKα/β , IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity induced by ox-LDL , and the inhibition of NF-κB activity was partly caused by Akt dephosphorylation . However , knockdown of Q01064 did not affect Akt , IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that vinpocetine exerts anti-atherogenic effects through inhibition of monocyte adhesion , oxidative stress and inflammatory response , which are mediated by Akt/NF-κB dependent pathway but independent of PDE1 blockade in macrophages .
