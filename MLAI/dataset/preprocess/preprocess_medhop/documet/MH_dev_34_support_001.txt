Disease-dependent reciprocal phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of c- DB00134 / P08581 contributes disease retardation of a transgenic mouse model of P35858 . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( P35858 ) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motoneurons . We have demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor ( P14210 ) attenuates loss of both spinal and brainstem motoneurons of P35858 model mice expressing mutated human P00441 (G93A) ( G93A ) . This study was designed to assess disease-dependent regulatory mechanisms of c- DB00134 / P08581 ( c- DB00134 ) activation in the facial motoneurons of G93A mice . Using double transgenic mice expressing P14210 and mutated P00441 (G93A) ( G93A/ P14210 ) , we showed that phosphorylation of c- DB00134 tyrosine residues at positions 1230 , 1234 and 1235 ( phospho- DB00135 ) , and thereby its activation , was slightly evident in G93A and highly obvious in G93A/ P14210 mice ( but absent in WT and P14210 -Tg mice ) . Phosphorylation of the c- DB00134 serine residue at position 985 ( phospho- DB00133 ) , a residue involved in the negative regulation of its activation , was evident in WT and P14210 -Tg mice . Protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , which is capable of dephosphorylating c- DB00134 phospho-serine , is upregulated in the facial motoneurons of G93A and G93A/ P14210 mice compared with WT and P14210 -Tg mice . Thus , c- DB00134 activation is reciprocally regulated by phosphorylation between c- DB00134 serine and tyrosine residues through PP2A induction in the presence or absence of mutant P00441 expression , and P14210 functions more efficiently in P35858 and P35858 -related diseases .
