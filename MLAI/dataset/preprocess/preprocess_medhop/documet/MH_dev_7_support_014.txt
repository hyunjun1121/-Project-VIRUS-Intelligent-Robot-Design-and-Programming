The analgesic efficacy of valdecoxib vs. oxycodone/acetaminophen after oral surgery . BACKGROUND : The authors conducted two studies to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase , or P36551 , -2-specific inhibitor , valdecoxib , with oxycodone/ acetaminophen in patients who have undergone oral surgery . METHODS : In total , 205 eligible subjects in Study A and 201 in Study B were randomized to receive a single oral dose of valdecoxib ( 20 or 40 milligrams ) , a combination of oxycodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1,000 mg or placebo . Eligible subjects experienced moderate-to-severe pain within six hours of surgery during which two or more impacted third molars were extracted . Analgesic efficacy was assessed over 24 hours or until the patient required rescue analgesia . RESULTS : In both studies , subjects receiving either dose of valdecoxib experienced a rapid onset of analgesia and ( among those who received valdecoxib 40 mg ) a level of pain relief comparable with that of those who received oxycodone/ acetaminophen . Both valdecoxib doses had a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect than did oxycodone/acetaminophen . Pooled safety data demonstrated that each valdecoxib dose had a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/ acetaminophen and similar to that of placebo . CONCLUSIONS : Orally administered valdecoxib is as rapidly acting and effective as oxycodone/acetaminophen , and it has a superior duration of analgesic effect in patients after oral surgery . DB00580 has a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/acetaminophen . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS : The current standard of care for alleviating acute pain after oral surgery has rested largely on conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid/analgesic combination products . The studies reported here suggest that the P35354 -specific inhibitor valdecoxib offers an efficacious and safe alternative to other analgesics used to treat pain after oral surgery .
