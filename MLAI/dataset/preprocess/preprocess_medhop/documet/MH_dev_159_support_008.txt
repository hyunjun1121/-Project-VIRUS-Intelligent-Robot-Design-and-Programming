DB01017 protects PC12 cells from ischemic-like injury and inhibits P09917 activation . DB01017 protects animals against cerebral ischemia by inhibiting inflammation . To determine whether minocycline protects PC12 cells from in vitro ischemic-like injury and affects pro-inflammatory P09917 activation , the cell viability and P09917 translocation to nuclear membrane were observed after oxygen-glucose deprivation ( OGD ) . We found that OGD reduced cell viability , which was attenuated by minocycline and P09917 inhibitor caffeic acid . 5-Lipoxygenase protein was detected in PC12 cells by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses . OGD induced P09917 translocation to nuclear membranes , which was abolished by minocycline and caffeic acid . Thus , minocycline can protect PC12 cells from in vitro ischemic-like injury , and this effect may be partly related to the inhibition of P09917 activation .
