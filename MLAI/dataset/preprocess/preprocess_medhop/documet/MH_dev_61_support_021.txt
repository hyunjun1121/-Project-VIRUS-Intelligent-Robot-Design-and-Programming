The β2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol elicits neuroprotective , anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic actions in the kainic acid model of excitotoxicity . Excitotoxicity is a mechanism of neuronal cell death implicated in a range of neurodegenerative conditions . Systemic administration of the excitotoxin kainic acid ( KA ) induces inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus , resulting in neuronal loss . Evidence indicates that stimulation of glial β(2)-adrenoceptors has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic properties that could result in neuroprotection . Consequently , in this study we examined the effect of the β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol on KA-induced inflammation , neurotrophic factor expression and apoptosis in the hippocampus . DB01407 ( 0.5mg/kg ) was administered to rats one hour prior to KA ( 10mg/kg ) . Epileptic behaviour induced by KA was assessed for three hours following administration using the Racine scale . Twenty-four hours later TUNEL staining in the P07451 hippocampal subfield and hippocampal caspase-3 activity was assessed to measure KA-induced apoptosis . In addition , expression of inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1β and IFN-γ ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , kynurenine pathway enzymes indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( P14902 ) and kynurenine monooxygenase ( O15229 ) , the microglial activation marker CD11b , and the neurotrophins P23560 and P01138 were quantified in the hippocampus using real-time PCR . Whilst clenbuterol treatment did not significantly alter KA-induced epileptic behavior it ameliorated KA-induced apoptosis , and this neuroprotective effect was accompanied by reduced inflammatory cytokine expression , reduced expression of P35228 , P14902 , O15229 and CD11b , coupled with increased P23560 and P01138 expression in KA-treated rats . In conclusion , the β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic actions and elicits a neuroprotective effect in the KA model of neurodegeneration .
