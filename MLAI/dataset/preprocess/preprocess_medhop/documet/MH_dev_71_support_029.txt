Single agent and combination studies of pralatrexate and molecular correlates of sensitivity . BACKGROUND : DB06813 is a dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) inhibitor with high affinity for reduced folate carrier 1 ( P41440 -1 ) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( Q05932 ) , resulting in extensive internalization and accumulation in tumour cells . DB06813 is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma and is being investigated in various malignancies . Here , we evaluated molecular correlates of sensitivity to pralatrexate and explored combinations with a variety of anticancer agents . METHODS : Antiproliferative effects of pralatrexate were evaluated in 15 human-cancer cell lines using the MTT assay . Gene expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR . RESULTS : DB06813 and methotrexate had a similar pattern of cytotoxicity , pralatrexate being more potent . DB06813 potentiated the effects of platinum drugs , antimetabolites and P00533 inhibitors . Dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of pralatrexate correlated with high mRNA expression of Q05932 . Acquired resistance to pralatrexate was associated with decreased P41440 -1 expression , whereas methotrexate resistance correlated with increased P00374 expression , suggesting different mechanisms of acquired resistance . CONCLUSION : DB06813 was more potent than methotrexate in a panel of solid tumour lines . Our findings support the further clinical development of pralatrexate in combination with certain cytotoxics and targeted therapies , and suggest that P41440 -1 , Q05932 and P00374 may be potential biomarkers of outcome .
