P48061 and [N33A] P48061 in 5637 and HeLa cells : regulating P00533 phosphorylation via calmodulin/calcineurin . In the human neoplastic cell lines 5637 and HeLa , recombinant P48061 elicited , as expected , downstream signals via both G-protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways responsible for inducing a rapid and a late wave , respectively , of P27361 /2 phosphorylation . In contrast , the structural variant [N33A] P48061 triggered no β-arrestin-dependent phosphorylation of P27361 /2 , and signaled via G protein-dependent pathways alone . Both P48061 and [N33A] P48061 , however , generated signals that transinhibited P00533 phosphorylation via intracellular pathways . 1 ) Prestimulation of P61073 / P00533 -positive 5637 or HeLa cells with P48061 modified the HB- P01133 -dependent activation of P00533 by delaying the peak phosphorylation of tyrosine 1068 or 1173 . 2 ) Prestimulation with the synthetic variant [N33A] P48061 , while preserving P61073 -related chemotaxis and P61073 internalization , abolished P00533 phosphorylation . 3 ) In cells knockdown of β-arrestin 2 , P48061 induced a full inhibition of P00533 like [N33A] P48061 in non-silenced cells . 4 ) P00533 phosphorylation was restored as usual by inhibiting PCK , calmodulin or calcineurin , whereas the inhibition of CaMKII had no discernable effect . We conclude that both recombinant P48061 and its structural variant [N33A] P48061 may transinhibit P00533 via G-proteins/calmodulin/calcineurin , but [N33A] P48061 does not activate β-arrestin-dependent P27361 /2 phosphorylation and retains a stronger inhibitory effect . Therefore , we demonstrated that P48061 may influence the magnitude and the persistence of signaling downstream of P00533 in turn involved in the proliferative potential of numerous epithelial cancer . In addition , we recognized that [N33A] P48061 activates preferentially G-protein-dependent pathways and is an inhibitor of P00533 .
