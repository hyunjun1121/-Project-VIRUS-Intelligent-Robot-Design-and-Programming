Q9GZV9 and its receptors . Q9GZV9 ( Q9GZV9 ) is a circulating factor that plays critical roles in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism , as evidenced by the fact that Q9GZV9 missense mutations cause autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets ( P30518 ) . Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by hypophosphatemia with inappropriately normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations , as well as bone pain , fracture and rickets . This phenotype parallels that of patients with tumor induced osteomalacia ( TIO ) , X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) , and fibrous dysplasia ( FD ) , in whom elevated serum Q9GZV9 levels are often observed . The fibroblast growth factor receptors ( P11362 -4 ) play key roles in skeletal development , as well as in normal metabolic processes . Several FGFR isoforms that potentially mediate the activity of Q9GZV9 have been implicated . In the short term , these findings will lead to further understanding of Q9GZV9 function , and potentially in the long term , to targeted therapies in disorders of hypo- and hyperphosphatemia that involve Q9GZV9 .
