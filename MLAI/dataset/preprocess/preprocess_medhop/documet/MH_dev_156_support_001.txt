Cytochromes P450 are differently expressed in normal and varicose human saphenous veins : linkage with varicosis . The expression of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes and cyclo-oxygenases ( P36551 ) was investigated in human saphenous veins by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis . Non-varicose veins were obtained from patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass grafting , whereas varicose veins were obtained from patients undergoing stripping removal of varicose saphenous veins . In non-varicose veins , Q16678 , CYP2C , P05181 and Q02928 were detected , whereas P51589 , P20815 , P23219 and P35354 were detected almost exclusively in varicose veins . P78329 was not detectable . Except for Q02928 , the levels of individual CYP mRNA were higher in varicose veins than in control veins . Smooth muscle cell volume , determined by a colour image-analysis system , was increased approximately 1.5-fold in varicose veins . Because CYPs and COXs produce various vasoactive compounds , increased expression of these enzymes could be involved in the impairment of vascular tone and may contribute to varicose pathology . Then , CYP or P36551 modulators may be potentially active in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency .
