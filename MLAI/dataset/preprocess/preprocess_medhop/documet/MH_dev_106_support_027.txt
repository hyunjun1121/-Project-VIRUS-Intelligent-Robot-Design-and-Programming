Coronavirus 3CLpro proteinase cleavage sites : possible relevance to P49591 virus pathology . BACKGROUND : Despite the passing of more than a year since the first outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( P49591 ) , efficient counter-measures are still few and many believe that reappearance of P49591 , or a similar disease caused by a coronavirus , is not unlikely . For other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases . Furthermore , several studies indicate that virus proliferation can be arrested using specific proteinase inhibitors supporting the belief that proteinases are indeed important during infection . Prompted by this , we set out to analyse and predict cleavage by the coronavirus main proteinase using computational methods . RESULTS : We retrieved sequence data on seven fully sequenced coronaviruses and identified the main 3CL proteinase cleavage sites in polyproteins using alignments . A neural network was trained to recognise the cleavage sites in the genomes obtaining a sensitivity of 87.0 % and a specificity of 99.0 % . Several proteins known to be cleaved by other viruses were submitted to prediction as well as proteins suspected relevant in coronavirus pathology . Cleavage sites were predicted in proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) , transcription factors CREB-RP and O75051 -1 , and components of the ubiquitin pathway . CONCLUSIONS : Our prediction method NetCorona predicts coronavirus cleavage sites with high specificity and several potential cleavage candidates were identified which might be important to elucidate coronavirus pathology . Furthermore , the method might assist in design of proteinase inhibitors for treatment of P49591 and possible future diseases caused by coronaviruses .
