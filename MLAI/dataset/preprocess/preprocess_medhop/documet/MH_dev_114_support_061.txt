DB00244 mediates expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis . BACKGROUND : P35354 ( P35354 ) is a key enzyme that produces prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) and plays an important role in colorectal tumor growth . In addition , recent researches focused on 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( P15428 ) , which degrades DB00917 . Here we determined the effect of DB00244 ( DB00244 ) on P35354 and P15428 expression and investigated its preventive effect for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : HT-29 cells were used in the in vitro experiments . c-Ha-ras transgenic mice were employed in order to explore the chemopreventive effects . Western blotting analysis was performed and the protein expression of P35354 and P15428 was quantified . RESULTS : DB00244 significantly suppressed P35354 expression and induced P15428 expression in HT-29 cells . In the transgenic mice , oral DB00244 intake reduced the incidence of colorectal tumor formation and the tumor size . Furthermore , we observed a down-regulation of P35354 and an up-regulation of P15428 in the tissue from colons of these mice . CONCLUSION : DB00244 exerts a preventive effect against colorectal tumor development through mediation of P35354 and P15428 expression .
