Pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic-induced weight gain : review and clinical implications . Second-generation antipsychotics ( SGAs ) , such as risperidone , clozapine and olanzapine , are the most common drug treatments for schizophrenia . SGAs presented an advantage over first-generation antipsychotics ( FGAs ) , particularly regarding avoidance of extrapyramidal symptoms . However , most SGAs , and to a lesser degree FGAs , are linked to substantial weight gain . This substantial weight gain is a leading factor in patient non-compliance and poses significant risk of diabetes , lipid abnormalities ( that is , metabolic syndrome ) and cardiovascular events including sudden death . The purpose of this article is to review the advances made in the field of pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic-induced weight gain ( AIWG ) . We included all published association studies in AIWG from December 2006 to date using the Medline and ISI web of knowledge databases . There has been considerable progress reaffirming previous findings and discovery of novel genetic factors . The P28335 and leptin genes are among the most promising , and new evidence suggests that the P14416 , P01375 , P60880 and P32245 genes are also prominent risk factors . Further promising findings have been reported in novel susceptibility genes , such as P21554 , P08183 , ADRA1A and Q9Y5U4 . More research is required before genetically informed , personalized medicine can be applied to antipsychotic treatment ; nevertheless , inroads have been made towards assessing genetic liability and plausible clinical application .
