DB08815 ( SM-13496 ) , a novel atypical antipsychotic drug , reverses MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in the rat passive-avoidance test . DB08815 ( SM-13496 ) is a novel atypical antipsychotic with high affinities to dopamine D2 , serotonin P34969 , 5- Q13049 , P08908 receptors and alpha2C adrenoceptor . In this study , the effects of lurasidone on the rat passive-avoidance response and its impairment by the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist MK-801 ( dizocilpine ) were evaluated and compared with those of other antipsychotics . The passive-avoidance response was examined by measuring the step-through latency , 1 day after the animals received foot-shock training . When given before the training session , lurasidone did not affect the passive-avoidance response at any dose tested ( 1-30 mg/kg , p.o. ) . All the other atypical antipsychotics examined ( i.e. , risperidone , olanzapine , quetiapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) , however , significantly reduced the step-through latency at relatively high doses . A pre-training administration of lurasidone significantly and dose-dependently reversed the MK-801-induced impairment of the passive-avoidance response . At doses lower than those that affected the passive-avoidance response , risperidone , quetiapine , and clozapine partially reduced the MK-801-induced impairment , whereas haloperidol , olanzapine , and aripiprazole were inactive . In addition , the post-training administration of lurasidone was as effective in countering the MK-801 effect as the pre-training administration , suggesting that lurasidone worked , at least in part , by restoring the memory consolidation process disrupted by MK-801 . These results suggest that lurasidone is superior to other antipsychotics in improving the MK-801-induced memory impairment and may be clinically useful for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia .
