Tetrathiafulvalene-1,3,5-triazines as (multi)donor-acceptor systems with tunable charge transfer : structural , photophysical , and theoretical investigations . Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions between chlorinated 1,3,5-triazines ( TZ ) and tetrathiafulvalene ( Q15669 ) trimethyltin derivatives afford mono- and P01024 symmetric tris( Q15669 )-triazines as donor-acceptor compounds in which the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) is modulated by the substitution scheme on Q15669 and TZ and by chemical or electrochemical oxidation . The Q15669 -TZ-Cl2 and (SMe)2TTF-TZ-Cl2 derivatives show fully planar structures in the solid state as a consequence of the conjugation between the two units . Electrochemical and photophysical investigations , supported by theoretical calculations , clearly demonstrate that the lowest excited state can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) π( Q15669 )→π*(TZ) transition . The tris( Q15669 ) compound [(SMe)2TTF]3-TZ shows fluorescence when excited in the ICT band , and the emission is quenched upon oxidation . The radical cations Q15669 (+•) are easily observed in all of the cases through chemical and electrochemical oxidation by steady-state absorption experiments . In the case of [(SMe)2TTF]3-TZ , a low energy band at 5000 cm(-1) , corresponding to a coupling between Q15669 (+•) and Q15669 units , is observed . A crystalline radical cation salt with the Q15669 -TZ-Cl2 donor and PF6(-) anion , prepared by electrocrystallization , is described .
