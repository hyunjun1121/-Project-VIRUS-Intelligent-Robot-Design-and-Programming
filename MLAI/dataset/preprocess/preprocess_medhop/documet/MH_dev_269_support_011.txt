DB08810 protects against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats : role of 5-hydroxytryptamine , prostaglandins and sulfhydryl compounds . This study was designed to determine the gastroprotective properties of cinitapride ( CNT ) , a novel prokinetic benzamide derivative agonist of Q13639 and 5-HT1 receptors and 5-HT2 antagonist , on mucosal injury produced by 50 % ( v/v ) ethanol . Results were compared with those for 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT : 10 mg kg-1 ) . The possible involvements of gastric mucus secretion , endogenous prostaglandins ( PGs ) and sulfhydryl compounds ( SH ) in the protection mediated by CNT were also examined . Intraperitoneal administration of CNT ( 0.50 and 1 mg kg-1 ) , 30 min before ethanol , significantly prevented gastric ulceration and increased the hexosamine content of gastric mucus . CNT ( 1 mg kg-1 ) also produced a significant increase in gastric mucosal levels of DB00917 , but did not induce any significant changes in SH values . On the contrary , pretreatment with 5-HT worsened ethanol-induced erosions , however , did not affect gastric mucus secretion , glycoprotein content or DB00917 levels , although the non-protein SH fraction was significantly decreased . The present results demonstrate that the gastroprotective effects of CNT could be partly explained by a complex PG dependent mechanism . We suggest that 5-HT dependent mechanisms through 5-HT2 receptor blockade and 5-HT1 receptor activation could be also involved .
