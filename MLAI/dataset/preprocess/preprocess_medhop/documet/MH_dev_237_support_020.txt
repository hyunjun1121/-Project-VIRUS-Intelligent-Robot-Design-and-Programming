Changes in single symptoms and separate factors of the schizophrenic syndrome after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol . DB00734 , a rather selective blocker of D-2 and P28223 receptors , was , in the doses 1 mg , 4 mg , 8 mg , 12 mg and 16 mg a day , compared to the rather selective D-2 blocker haloperidol in the dose of 10 mg a day , in 88 chronic schizophrenic patients . After one week placebo wash-out , the patients were randomly assigned to one of the six treatment groups and the study was performed as a double blind parallel-group study for 8 weeks . In the present analysis , a special emphasis has been laid on the effects on single symptoms and separate factors in the schizophrenic syndrome . Overall , risperidone in a dose of 4 mg a day was comparable to haloperidol in a dose of 10 mg a day . DB00734 was found to have a curvilinear dose-response curve with an optimum effect of 4 mg day on the negative , anxious/depressive and cognitive factors and with an optimum effect of 8 mg day on the positive and excited factors . While haloperidol had significant effects on the negative and anxious/depressive factors , risperidone had significant effects on all five factors - the positive , the negative , the excited , the anxious/depressive and the cognitive . The fact that the novel drug had significant effects on the cognitive factor might be of great importance as concerns the possibilities for rehabilitation of chronic schizophrenic patients .
