DB00065 treatment reduces complement activation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . BACKGROUND : Tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) blocking agents decrease C reactive protein ( CRP ) levels in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . It has been shown that CRP may contribute to complement activation in RA . OBJECTIVE : To assess the effect of intravenous infliximab treatment on complement activation , especially that mediated by CRP , in RA . METHODS : 35 patients with active RA ( 28 joint count Disease Activity Score ( DAS28 ) > 4.4 ) were treated with intravenous injections of infliximab ( 3 mg/kg , at weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 , and 22 ) . Clinical response and plasma levels of complement activation products , of CRP and of CRP-complement complexes , which are specific markers for CRP mediated complement activation , were assessed at the indicated time points up to 22 weeks . The relationship between CRP and CRP-complement complexes was analysed by paired t test between two time points and by generalised estimated equation , to test differences of variables over time . RESULTS : At 2 weeks after the first dose , infliximab significantly reduced overall P01024 and C4 activation and plasma levels of CRP and CRP-complement complexes were also significantly reduced at this time point . The effects of infliximab on CRP and complement continued throughout the observation period and were more pronounced in patients with a good response to infliximab treatment . CONCLUSION : Treatment with infliximab decreases plasma levels of CRP and CRP dependent complement activation products and concomitantly may reduce complement activation in RA . Complement activation may be among the effector mechanisms of P01375 in RA .
