Effect of matrine on the expression of DB05875 receptor and inflammatory cytokines production in human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts . Matrine is a kind of alkaloid found in certain Sophora plants , which has been extensively used in China for the treatment of viral hepatitis , cancer , cardiac diseases and skin diseases ( such as atopic dermatitis and eczema ) . It also has been confirmed that DB05875 ( SP ) and its receptor ( neurokinin-1 receptor , P25103 ) are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disorders . So the present study was designed to investigate the effect of matrine on the expression of P25103 and cytokines production induced by SP in HaCaT cells ( a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line ) and dermal fibroblasts . In addition , cell viability was also evaluated . The results showed that matrine inhibited the expression of P25103 in HaCaT cells and fibroblasts . SP induced the production of interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , P10145 , interferon ( IFN ) -gamma , and monocyte chemotactic protein ( MCP ) -1 in both cell types . Matrine 5-100 microg/mL had little effect on cell viability . It inhibited SP-induced IL-1beta , P10145 and P13500 production in HaCaT cells and fibroblasts , while it increased the production of P01579 in HaCaT cells . Both SP and matrine had no effect on the secretion of P05231 . These findings suggest that matrine may have potential treatment function on SP related cutaneous inflammation by inhibition of the expression of DB05875 receptor and regulation of the production of inflammatory cytokines .
