Effects of serotonin on expression of the P01130 family member Q92673 and 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis in human vascular smooth muscle cells . Serotonin ( 5-HT ) is a known mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . The dedifferentiation and proliferation/apoptosis of VSMCs in the arterial intima represent one of the atherosclerotic changes . Q92673 , a member of low-density lipoprotein receptor family , may contribute to the proliferation of VSMCs in neointimal hyperplasia . We conducted an in vitro study to investigate whether 5-HT is involved in Q92673 expression in human VSMCs and apoptosis of VSMCs induced by 7-ketocholesterol ( 7KCHO ) , an oxysterol that destabilizes plaque . 5-HT enhanced the proliferation of VSMCs , and this effect was abolished by sarpogrelate , a selective 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist . Sarpogrelate also inhibited the 5-HT-enhanced Q92673 mRNA expression in VSMCs . Furthermore , 5-HT suppressed the 7KCHO-induced apoptosis of VSMCs via caspase-3/7-dependent pathway . These findings provide new insights on the changes in the differentiation stage of VSMCs mediated by 5-HT .
