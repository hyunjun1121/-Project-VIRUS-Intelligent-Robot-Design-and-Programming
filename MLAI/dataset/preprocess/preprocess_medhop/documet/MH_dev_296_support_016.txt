Argon-helium cryosurgery for treatment of P13671 gliomas in rats and its effect on cellular immunity . Argon-helium cryosurgery has shown encouraging therapeutic effects on some solid tumors , but its application in the treatment of gliomas remains poorly documented . To explore the cell apoptosis at the glioma foci and the cellullar immunity changes following argon-helium cryosurgery , we established Wistar rat models bearing subcutaneous P13671 glioma and divided the rats into the normal control ( 20 rats ) , sham-operated ( 32 rats ) , surgical resection ( 20 rats ) , and cryosurgery ( 32 rats ) groups with corresponding treatments . The postoperative changes in the findings by magnetic resonance imaging ( Q9BWK5 ) and tumor cell morphology were observed , and the cell apoptosis at the tumor foci was assessed with TUNEL assay . Flow cytometry was performed for analysis of the T lymphocyte subset changes following the cryosurgery . The results showed that cryosurgery induced not only destruction of the tumor cells but also cell apoptosis around the cryablation foci . Compared with surgical resction that caused significant reduction in CD3+ and P01730 + cell percentages , cryosurgery resulted in significantly increased percentages of CD3+ and P01730 + cells ( P < 0.05 ) with a relative increase of the P01730 +/CD8+ cell ratio 14 days after the operation . These results demonstrate that in addition to tumor cell destruction , cryosurgy also results in enhanced cellular immunity and antitumor immune response of the P13671 glioma-bearing rats , suggesting the great potential of argon-helium cryosurgery in clinical management of gliomas .
