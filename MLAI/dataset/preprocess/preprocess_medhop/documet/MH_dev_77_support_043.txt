Regulated secretion is impaired in AtT-20 endocrine cells stably transfected with botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain . Botulinum neurotoxin type A ( DB00083 ) inhibits neurotransmitter release by specific cleavage of P60880 , a synaptosome-associated protein also expressed in the DB01285 secretory cell line AtT-20 . Expression of light chain DB00083 ( L- DB00083 ) gene transfected into AtT-20 cells resulted in a cleaved form of P60880 indistinguishable from that generated by bona fide DB00083 . L- DB00083 -transfected cells showed no difference in replication rate , viability , or phenotype , compared with control AtT-20 cells . In contrast , L- DB00083 -transfected cells could not be induced to secrete DB01285 upon stimulation by 8-bromo- DB02527 or DB00761 . In addition , alpha-latrotoxin induced DB01285 release from control cells , but not from L- DB00083 -transfected cells . These experiments suggest an important role for P60880 in regulated secretion from AtT-20 cells and underline the usefulness of this cell system as a tool for the study of the molecular mechanism of peptide hormone secretion .
