Phytoestrogens induce apoptosis through a mitochondria/caspase pathway in human breast cancer cells . OBJECTIVE : To explore the effect and pathway of phytoestrogens on the growth of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 . METHODS : MCF-7 cells ( human estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer cells ) were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with genistein , resveratrol , and quercetin ( 10(-10)-10(-4) mol/l ) . After further incubation for 24 , 48 , 72 , and 92 h , the cells were harvested and extracted for 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . According to the above results , the proteins involving proliferative and apoptotic pathways were evaluated by Western blot analysis . RESULTS : DB01645 , resveratrol , and quercetin significantly inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Significantly elevated caspase-3 activity was noted after treatment with genistein ( 10(-9)-10(-7) mol/l ) , as well as with resveratrol and quercetin ( 10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l ) . Significant reduction of PI3K and AKT protein and significant increase of P48023 , Fas-associated protein with death domain , cytochrome C , truncated Bid , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 were all noted after genistein , resveratrol , and quercetin treatment . 17β-Estradiol induced completely opposite results . P03372 ( ER ) α expression was significantly increased with 17β-estradiol , whereas ERβ expression was significantly elevated in the cultures with genistein , resveratrol , and quercetin . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that genistein , resveratrol , and quercetin have antiproliferative effects on breast cancer cells . Their induction of apoptosis involves the activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways , which may be related to the differential affinity to ERα and ERβ . Whether phytoestrogens have similar effects on normal breast cells remains to be examined .
