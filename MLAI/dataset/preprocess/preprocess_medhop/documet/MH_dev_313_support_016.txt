Rindopepimut , a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine against EGFRvIII for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme . Celldex Therapeutics is developing rindopepimut ( DB05374 ) , a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Rindopepimut specifically targets a novel junctional epitope of the P00533 deletion mutant EGFRvIII , which is a constitutively active receptor that is expressed in approximately 60 to 70 % of patients with GBM . EGFRvIII expression is correlated with worse prognosis and reduced overall survival . Importantly , EGFRvIII is not expressed in normal brain tissue , making it an excellent therapeutic target . Preclinical studies demonstrated lasting tumor regression and increased survival times , as well as efficient generation of EGFRvIII-specific humoral and cellular immune responses , in animals expressing EGFRvIII and vaccinated with rindopepimut . Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM demonstrated significantly increased median time to progression and overall survival time in those vaccinated with rindopepimut compared with matched historical controls . Only limited side effects have been observed in patients . Given these results , rindopepimut is an extremely promising therapy for patients with GBM . Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM were ongoing at the time of publication . In the future , it may be beneficial to combine rindopepimut with other treatment modalities to further prolong survival .
