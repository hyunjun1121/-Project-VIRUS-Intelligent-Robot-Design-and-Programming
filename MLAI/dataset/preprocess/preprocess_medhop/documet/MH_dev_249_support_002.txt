The potential role of bevacizumab in early stages and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer . Improving outcomes for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is a major research area considering that a significant percentage of such patients develop recurrent disease within 5 years of complete lung resection . Adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs survival , with an absolute improvement in 5-year overall survival of about 5 % with drawbacks such as treatment toxicity . Approximately , one third of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC have locally advanced disease not amenable for surgical resection - in this setting of patients concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of therapy . However , the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC is still controversial and clinical outcomes are disappointing , and so new approaches are required to improve the clinical benefit in this setting of patients . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) is a key angiogenic factor implicated in tumor blood vessels formation and permeability , and tumor P15692 overexpression in patients with early stage lung cancer has been associated with worse relapse free and overall survival . Several agents have been developed that inhibit P15692 or its receptor signalling system . DB00112 is the first recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding P15692 to demonstrate clinical benefit or rather a survival prolongation in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of non-squamous advanced NSCLC patients . These positive results led to a large number of clinical trials to evaluate bevacizumab in combination with other targeted agents in advanced disease , and to define the role of this agent in early stage NSCLC such as the impact of bevacizumab integration in chemoradiotherapy strategy for locally advanced disease .
