Pre-clinical evaluation of an in vitro selection protocol for the enrichment of transduced P28906 + cell-derived human dendritic cells . The efficient genetic modification of P28906 + cell-derived dendritic cells ( DC ) will provide a significant advancement towards the development of immunotherapy protocols for cancer , autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases . Recent reports have described the transduction of P28906 + cells via retrovirus- and lentivirus-based gene transfer vectors and subsequent differentiation into functional DC . Since there is significant apprehension regarding the clinical uses of HIV-based vectors , in this report , we compare a murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) - and a human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -based bicistronic vector for gene transfer into human P28906 + cells and subsequent differentiation into mature DC . Each vector expressed both EGFP and the dominant selectable marker P00374 (L22Y) allowing for the enrichment of marked cells in the presence of the antifolate drug trimetrexate ( TMTX ) . Both MLV-based and HIV-based vectors efficiently transduced cytokine mobilized human peripheral blood P28906 + cells . However , in vitro expansion and differentiation in the presence of GM- P04141 , P01375 , Flt-3L , P21583 and P05112 resulted in a reduction in the percentage of DC expressing the transgene . Selection with TMTX during differentiation increased the percentage of marked DC , resulting in up to 79 % ( MLV vector ) and up to 94 % ( lentivirus-vector ) transduced cells expressing EGFP without loss of DC phenotype . Thus , MLV-based vectors and in vitro selection of transduced human DC show great promise for immunotherapy protocols .
