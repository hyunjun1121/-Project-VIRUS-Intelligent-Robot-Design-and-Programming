DB05258 receptors are important for antiproliferative effect of interferon-alpha against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells . AIM : Interferon ( IFN ) -alpha is a promising drug for the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . We reported that responders to IFN-alpha/5-fluorouracil combination therapy expressed higher IFN alpha receptor ( P17181 )2 in tumor . Herein we studied involvement of IFNARs in response to IFN-alpha in HCC cells . METHODS : IFN-alpha sensitivity and expression of IFNARs were studied in six HCC cell lines ( HuH7 , P98160 /PRF/5 , P08246 , HLF , HepG2 , Hep3B ) using growth-inhibitory and RT-PCR , Western blot assays . Short interfering RNAs ( SiRNAs ) against P17181 and 2 were used to analyze the role of the IFNARs in IFN-alpha 's effect and signal transduction . RESULTS : The expressions of P17181 and 2c mRNAs were higher in P98160 /PRF/5 cells than those in other cell lines , and P98160 /PRF/5 cells expressed abundant IFNAR2c on their cell membrane . When we examined the sensitivity of the HCC cell lines to the growth-inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha , P98160 /PRF/5 exhibited a significant response , while the other cells were much more resistant . Knockdown of either P17181 or 2 using siRNAs suppressed the IFN-alpha 's signal transduction ( 2.5-fold ) , and decreased the growth-inhibitory effect ( down by 69.9 % and 67.3 % ) . CONCLUSION : The results suggest that the expression of P17181 and IFNAR2c independently are important for the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha in HCC cells .
