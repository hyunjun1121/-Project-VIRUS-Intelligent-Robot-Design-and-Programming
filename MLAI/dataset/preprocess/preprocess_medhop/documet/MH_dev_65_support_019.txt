DB00435 donor , (+/-)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine , stabilizes transactive hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha by inhibiting von Hippel-Lindau recruitment and asparagine hydroxylation . We have confirmed that the NO donor (+/-)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( P60880 ) stabilizes the transactive form of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) , leading to the induction of HIF-1alpha target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and carbonic anhydrase 9 . Activation of HIF-1alpha should require inhibition of the dual system that keeps it inactive . One is ubiquitination , which is triggered by hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha-proline and the subsequent binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase , the von Hippel Lindau ( P40337 ) protein . The other is hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha-asparagine , which reduces the affinity of HIF-1alpha for its coactivator , DB02527 responsive element binding protein/p300 . We examined the effects of the NO donor P60880 on proline and asparagine hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha peptides by measuring the activities of the corresponding enzymes , HIF-1alpha-specific proline hydroxylase 2 ( Q9GZT9 ) and the HIF-1alpha-specific asparagine hydroxylase , designated factor inhibiting HIF-1alpha ( Q9NWT6 ) , respectively . We found that the P60880 did not prevent Q9GZT9 from hydroxylating the proline of HIF-1alpha . Instead , it blocked the interaction between P40337 and the proline-hydroxylated HIF-1alpha , but only when the reducing agents Fe(II) and vitamin C were limiting . The fact that the absence of cysteine 520 of HIF-1alpha abolishes its responsiveness to P60880 suggests that this residue mediates the inhibition by P60880 of the interaction between P40337 and HIF-1alpha , presumably by S-nitrosylation of HIF-1alpha . Un-like Q9GZT9 , asparagine hydroxylation by Q9NWT6 was directly inhibited by P60880 , but again only when reducing agents were limiting . Substitution of cysteine 800 of HIF-1alpha with alanine failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of P60880 on asparagine hydroxylation , implying that Q9NWT6 , not its substrate HIF-1alpha , is inhibited by P60880 .
