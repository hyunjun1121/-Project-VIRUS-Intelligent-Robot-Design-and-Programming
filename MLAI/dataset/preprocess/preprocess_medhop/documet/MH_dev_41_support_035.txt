Differential reconstitution of T cell subsets following immunodepleting treatment with alemtuzumab ( anti- P31358 monoclonal antibody ) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis . DB00087 ( anti- P31358 mAb ) provides long-lasting disease activity suppression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . The objective of this study was to characterize the immunological reconstitution of T cell subsets and its contribution to the prolonged RRMS suppression following alemtuzumab-induced lymphocyte depletion . The study was performed on blood samples from RRMS patients enrolled in the CARE-MS II clinical trial , which was recently completed and led to the submission of alemtuzumab for U.S . Food and Drug Administration approval as a treatment for RRMS . DB00087 -treated patients exhibited a nearly complete depletion of circulating P01730 (+) lymphocytes at day 7 . During the immunological reconstitution , P01730 (+)CD25(+)CD127(low) regulatory T cells preferentially expanded within the P01730 (+) lymphocytes , reaching their peak expansion at month 1 . The increase in the percentage of TGF-β1- , P22301 - , and P05112 -producing P01730 (+) cells reached a maximum at month 3 , whereas a significant decrease in the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells was detected at months 12 and 24 in comparison with the baseline . A gradual increase in serum P13232 and P05112 and a decrease in Q16552 , Q96PD4 , Q9HBE4 , Q9GZX6 , and IFN-γ levels were detected following treatment . In vitro studies have demonstrated that P13232 induced an expansion of P01730 (+)CD25(+)CD127(low) regulatory T cells and a decrease in the percentages of Th17 and Th1 cells . In conclusion , our results indicate that differential reconstitution of T cell subsets and selectively delayed P01730 (+) T cell repopulation following alemtuzumab-induced lymphopenia may contribute to its long-lasting suppression of disease activity .
