P00533 inhibitors exacerbate differentiation and cell cycle arrest induced by retinoic acid and vitamin D3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells . By means of an unbiased , automated fluorescence microscopy-based screen , we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib as potent enhancers of the differentiation of HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cells exposed to suboptimal concentrations of vitamin A ( all-trans retinoic acid , DB00755 ) or vitamin D ( 1Î±, DB00146 , VD ) . Erlotinib and gefitinib alone did not promote differentiation , yet stimulated the acquisition of morphological and biochemical maturation markers ( including the expression of CD11b and P08571 as well as increased NADPH oxidase activity ) when combined with either DB00755 or VD . Moreover , the combination of erlotinib and DB00755 or VD synergistically induced all the processes that are normally linked to terminal hematopoietic differentiation , namely , a delayed proliferation arrest in the G0/ P55008 phase of the cell cycle , cellular senescence , and apoptosis . Erlotinib potently inhibited the (auto)phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 ( Q16539 , best known as p38(MAPK) ) and P12931 family kinases ( SFKs ) . If combined with the administration of DB00755 or VD , the inhibition of p38(MAPK) or SFKs with specific pharmacological agents mimicked the pro-differentiation activity of erlotinib . These data were obtained with 2 distinct AML cell lines ( HL-60 and MOLM-13 cells ) and could be confirmed on primary leukemic blasts isolated from the circulation of AML patients . Altogether , these findings point to a new regimen for the treatment of AML , in which naturally occurring pro-differentiation agents ( DB00755 or VD ) may be combined with P00533 inhibitors .
