A fully human recombinant IgG-like bispecific antibody to both the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin-like growth factor receptor for enhanced antitumor activity . Both the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGFR ) have been implicated in the tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers . Here we propose that simultaneous targeting of both receptors with a bispecific antibody would lead to enhanced antitumor activity . To this end , we produced a recombinant human IgG-like bispecific antibody , a Di-diabody , using the variable regions from two antagonistic antibodies : DB05774 to P00533 and DB05759 to IGFR . The Di-diabody binds to both P00533 and IGFR and effectively blocked both P01133 - and IGF-stimulated receptor activation and tumor cell proliferation . The Di-diabody also inherited the biological properties from both of its parent antibodies ; it triggers rapid and significant IGFR internalization and degradation and mediates effective antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cells . Finally , the Di-diabody strongly inhibited the growth of two different human tumor xenografts in vivo . Our results underscore the benefits of simultaneous targeting of two tumor targets with bispecific antibodies .
