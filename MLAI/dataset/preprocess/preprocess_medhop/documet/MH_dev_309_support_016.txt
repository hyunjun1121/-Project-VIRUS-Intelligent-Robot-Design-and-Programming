Pharmacological rescue of Ras signaling , P42261 -dependent synaptic plasticity , and learning deficits in a fragile X model . Fragile X syndrome , caused by the loss of Fmr1 gene function , is the most common form of inherited mental retardation , with no effective treatment . Using a tractable animal model , we investigated mechanisms of action of a few FDA-approved psychoactive drugs that modestly benefit the cognitive performance in fragile X patients . Here we report that compounds activating serotonin ( 5HT ) subtype 2B receptors ( 5HT2B-Rs ) or dopamine ( DA ) subtype 1-like receptors ( D1-Rs ) and/or those inhibiting 5HT2A-Rs or D2-Rs moderately enhance Ras-PI3K/ P31749 signaling input , P42261 -dependent synaptic plasticity , and learning in Fmr1 knockout mice . Unexpectedly , combinations of these 5HT and DA compounds at low doses synergistically stimulate Ras-PI3K/ P31749 signal transduction and P42261 -dependent synaptic plasticity and remarkably restore normal learning in Fmr1 knockout mice without causing anxiety-related side effects . These findings suggest that properly dosed and combined FDA-approved psychoactive drugs may effectively treat the cognitive impairment associated with fragile X syndrome .
