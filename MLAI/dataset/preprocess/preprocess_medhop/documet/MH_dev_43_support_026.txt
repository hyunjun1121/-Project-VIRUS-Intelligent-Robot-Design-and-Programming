Binding of C/EBPbeta to the P02741 ( CRP ) promoter in Hep3B cells is associated with transcription of CRP mRNA . Expression of the acute phase protein P02741 ( CRP ) is tightly regulated in hepatocytes . Although very little CRP mRNA is transcribed normally , inflammatory stimuli are followed by a dramatic increase in mRNA synthesis and accumulation . P05231 and IL-1beta are believed to be the major cytokines responsible for induction of CRP and other acute phase proteins . Our previous studies , using transient transfection and EMSA experiments , implicated involvement of the transcription factors C/EBPbeta , P40763 , Rel p50 , and c-Rel in CRP induction . In the current study we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to determine the kinetics of transcription factor occupancy of these transcription factors on the endogenous CRP promoter . All of these transcription factors were found bound to the endogenous CRP promoter in the absence of cytokines , but cytokine treatment markedly increased binding of only C/EBPbeta . In addition , c-Rel and TATA box-binding protein ( P20226 ) appeared to occupy the promoter in parallel in the presence of cytokines . In the absence of cytokines , CRP mRNA accumulation was not measurable but began to increase by 3 h after exposure of cells to IL-1beta plus P05231 , peaking at 12 h with secondary peaks at 18 and 24 h . The secondary peaks in mRNA expression paralleled the pattern of binding of c-Rel and P20226 to the CRP promoter . We conclude that the CRP promoter has a low level of transcription factor occupancy in the absence of cytokines and induction occurs with binding of C/EBP , and that c-Rel and P20226 are important for modulating CRP expression .
