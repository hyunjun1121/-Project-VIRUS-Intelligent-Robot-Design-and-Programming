A phase II study of erlotinib ( DB00530 ) given in combination with carboplatin in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer ( NCIC CTG IND.149 ) . OBJECTIVES : Approximately 50 % of ovarian cancers have elevated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) which correlates with a poor prognosis . Preclinical evidence suggests that P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) , such as erlotinib ( DB00530 ) , may potentiate the anti-tumour effects of cytotoxic agents , including carboplatin . Blocking P00533 could thus potentially reverse drug resistance . The primary objective of the study was to assess the response rate to the addition of erlotinib in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were receiving carboplatin . METHODS : Patients enrolled on this study had either local or advanced recurrent ovarian cancer with measurable disease . They may have had up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens , one of which must have contained platinum , and they must have responded to prior platinum therapy . Patients were stratified by platinum sensitivity and were treated with erlotinib 150 mg daily on a continuous dosing schedule , and carboplatin at an AUC of 5 every 21 days . RESULTS : Fifty patients with recurrent ovarian cancer entered the study , 33 in the platinum-sensitive arm and 17 in the platinum-resistant arm . Of patients evaluable for response , there were 14 partial responses ( PR ) of 30 evaluable for response ( 57 % objective response rate ( ORR ) ) in the platinum-sensitive arm , and 1 PR of 14 evaluable for response ( 7 % ORR ) in the platinum-resistant arm . CONCLUSIONS : The combination of erlotinib and carboplatin was active in patients with platinum-sensitive disease , but not in platinum-resistant disease . The toxicities seen were those expected with carboplatin and erlotinib .
