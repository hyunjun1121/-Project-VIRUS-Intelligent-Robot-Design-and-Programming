Molecular-based choice of cancer therapy : realities and expectations . Current choice of cancer therapy is usually empirical and relies mainly on the statistical prediction of the treatment success . Molecular research provides some opportunities to personalize antitumor treatment . For example , life-threatening toxic reactions can be avoided by the identification of subjects , who carry susceptible genotypes of drug-metabolizing genes ( e.g. P51580 , P22309 , P42898 , Q12882 ) . Tumor sensitivity can be predicted by molecular portraying of targets and other molecules associated with drug response . Tailoring of antiestrogen and trastuzumab therapy based on hormone and P04626 receptor status has already become a classical example of customized medicine . Other predictive markers have been identified both for cytotoxic and for targeted therapies , and include , for example , expression of TS , TP , Q12882 , OPRT , P07992 , P16455 , P11388 , class III beta-tubulin molecules as well as genomic alterations of P00533 , P10721 , P00519 oncogenes .
