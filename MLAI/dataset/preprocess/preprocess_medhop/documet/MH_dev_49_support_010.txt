Phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of growth and regulation of proto-oncogene expression in the human T cell leukemia line JURKAT . The expression and function of several proto-oncogenes were examined in a human acute T cell leukemia line , JURKAT , during phorbol ester-induced terminal differentiation . Treating JURKAT cells with the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ) inhibited their proliferation and induced expression of the gene for the interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain ( IL2R-alpha ) , consistent with previous reports . In unstimulated proliferating JURKAT cells , high levels of C-MYC , N- DB01367 , and P10415 mRNAs were found that diminished rapidly following TPA-induced cessation of growth . In contrast , accumulation of mRNAs for the C- P01100 , C- P05412 , and P18146 genes increased markedly in TPA-treated cells and preceded the induction of IL2R-alpha mRNA . Expression of C- P10242 , C-RAF-1 , C- P06239 , C- P06241 , and C- P09769 proto-oncogenes was relatively unchanged . To explore directly the function of two of these protooncogenes in regulating the growth of JURKAT T cells , we stably transferred C-MYC and P10415 expression plasmids into these cells . Despite sustained expression of C-MYC , P10415 , or the combination of these protooncogenes , TPA continued to inhibit JURKAT cell growth and to induce IL2R expression . Thus , although C-MYC and P10415 proto-oncogene expression correlated with proliferation in TPA-treated JURKAT cells , continuous over-expression of even the combination of these oncogenes was insufficient for abrogating the effects of TPA in these leukemic T cells . Because human lymphoid malignancies frequently contain chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of C-MYC and P10415 , our findings could have relevance for attempts to induce terminal differentiation of leukemic cells by in vitro exposure of patients ' bone marrow cells to phorbol esters .
