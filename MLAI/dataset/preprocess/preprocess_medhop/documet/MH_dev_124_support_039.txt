Endotoxin induces proliferation of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo : role of P35354 and P00533 activation . Lung cancer is frequently complicated by pulmonary infections which may impair prognosis of this disease . Therefore , we investigated the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) on tumor proliferation in vitro in the non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line A549 , ex vivo in a tissue culture model using human NSCLC specimens and in vivo in the A549 adenocarcinoma mouse model . LPS induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in proliferation of A549 cells as quantified by MTS activity and cell counting . In parallel , an increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 was detected both in A549 cells and in ex vivo human NSCLC tissue . Large amounts of P35354 -derived prostaglandin (PG)E(2) were secreted from LPS-stimulated A549 cells . Pharmacological interventions revealed that the proliferative effect of LPS was dependent on P08571 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 . Moreover , blocking of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) also decreased LPS-induced proliferation of A549 cells . Inhibition of P35354 activity in A549 cells severely attenuated both PGE(2) release and proliferation in response to LPS . Synthesis of PGE(2) was also reduced by inhibiting P08571 , O00206 and P00533 in A549 cells . The proliferative effect of LPS on A549 cells could be reproduced in the A549 adenocarcinoma mouse model with enhancement of tumor growth and Ki-67 expression in implanted tumors . In summary , LPS induces proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro , ex vivo in human NSCLC specimen and in vivo in a mouse model of NSCLC . Pulmonary infection may thus directly induce tumor progression in NSCLC .
