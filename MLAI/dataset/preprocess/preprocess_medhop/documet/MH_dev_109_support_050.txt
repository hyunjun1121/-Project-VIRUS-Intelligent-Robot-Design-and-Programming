The anti- P08514 -IIIa agents : fundamental and clinical aspects . The platelet P08514 /IIIa receptor mediates platelet aggregation induced by all physiologic agonists . Blockade of the receptor , either by monoclonal antibodies or small molecules patterned after the arginine glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) cell recognition domain , prevents arterial thrombosis in animal models much better than does aspirin . c7E3 Fab , the Fab fragment of the mouse/human chimeric antibody DB00054 ( abciximab : ReoPro ) , was shown to reduce ischemic events after angioplasty when given in conjunction with heparin and aspirin to patients at high risk in the EPIC study , but its was associated with an increase in bleeding . Preliminary data from the subsequent EPILOG study , in which a lower dose of heparin was used , demonstrated efficacy in low risk as well as high risk patients and no significant increase in major bleeding . Preliminary data from the CAPTURE study support the use of c7E3 Fab in patients with unstable angina who are candidates for PTCA within 24 hours . Positive trends toward decreased thrombotic events have also been observed in patients treated with small molecule inhibitors of P08514 /IIIa receptors . This new class of agents thus holds promise for improving the therapy of angioplasty as well as perhaps other thrombotic phenomena .
