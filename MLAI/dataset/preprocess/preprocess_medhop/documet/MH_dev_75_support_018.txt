Expression profile of genes associated with the dopamine pathway in vitiligo skin biopsies and blood sera . BACKGROUND : Dopamine has been proven to be toxic for melanocytes . In vitiligo patients the level of dopamine is increased and the functioning of several enzymes participating in the dopamine pathway is changed . METHODS : With the use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and ELISA the expression of genes connected to the dopamine pathway ( PAH , P61457 , TH , DDC , P09172 , PNMT , P07203 , P21397 , P27338 , P21964 , P21728 - P21918 , P54219 and Q05940 ) was observed in vitiligo patients ' and control subjects ' skin and blood . RESULTS : The mRNA expression of P07203 , DDC , P21397 , P21728 and P21918 differs in vitiligo skin and the protein level of DDC , P21397 , P27338 , P21728 and P21918 is changed in vitiligo patients ' skin and/or blood sera . CONCLUSIONS : The dopamine pathway probably influences melanogenesis directly or through the melanocortin pathway . We provide new data about changes of expression profile of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme DDC , the dopamine-degrading enzymes P21397 and P27338 and the D1-like family dopamine receptors in vitiligo skin and blood sera .
