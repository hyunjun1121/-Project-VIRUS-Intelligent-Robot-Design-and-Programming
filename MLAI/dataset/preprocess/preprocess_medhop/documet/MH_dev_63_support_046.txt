A Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein that forms inhibitory complexes with type I interferon receptor subunits , Jak and P35610 proteins , and blocks interferon-mediated signal transduction . Type I interferons ( IFNs ) are important mediators of innate antiviral defense and function by activating a signaling pathway through their cognate type I receptor ( P17181 ) . Here we report that lytic replication of Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) efficiently blocks type I IFN signaling and that an important effector of this blockade is the viral protein Q9HBH0 , the product of open reading frame 10 . Q9HBH0 blocks IFN signaling by formation of inhibitory complexes that contain P17181 subunits , the Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 , and the P52630 transcription factor . Activation of both Tyk2 and Jak1 is inhibited , and abnormal recruitment of P52630 to P17181 occurs despite the decrement in Tyk2 activity . As a result of these actions , phosphorylation of both P52630 and P42224 is impaired , with subsequent failure of ISGF3 accumulation in the nucleus . The presence in the viral genome of potent inhibitors of type I IFN signaling , along with several viral genes that block IFN induction , highlights the importance of the IFN pathway in the control of this human tumor virus infection .
