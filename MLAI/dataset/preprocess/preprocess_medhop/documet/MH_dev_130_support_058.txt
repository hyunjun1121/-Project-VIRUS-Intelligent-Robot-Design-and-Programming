Superagonistic action of 14-epi-analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D explained by vitamin D receptor-coactivator interaction . Two 14-epi-analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) ] , 19-nor-14-epi-23-yne-1,25-(OH)2D3 ( TX522 ) and 19-nor-14,20-bisepi-23-yne-1,25-(OH)2D3 ( TX527 ) , show enhanced antiproliferative ( at least 10-fold ) and markedly lower calcemic effects both in vitro and in vivo , compared with 1,25-(OH)2D3 . This study aimed to evaluate their superagonistic effect at the level of interaction between the Vitamin D receptor ( P11473 ) and coactivators . Mammalian two-hybrid assays with VP16-fused P11473 and GAL4-DNA-binding-domain-fused steroid receptor coactivator 1 ( Q15788 ) , transcriptional intermediary factor 2 ( Tif2 ) , or Q15648 showed the 14-epi-analogs to be more potent inducers of P11473 -coactivator interactions than 1,25-(OH)2D3 ( up to 16- and 20-fold stronger induction of P11473 - Q15788 interaction for TX522 and TX527 at 10(-10) M ) . Similar assays in which metabolism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was blocked with VID400 , a selective inhibitor of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-metabolizing enzyme Q07973 , showed that the enhanced potency of these analogs in establishing P11473 -coactivator interactions can only partially be accounted for by their increased resistance to metabolic degradation . Crystallization of TX522 complexed to the ligand binding domain of the human P11473 demonstrated that the epi-configuration of C14 caused the CD ring of the ligand to shift by 0.5 angstroms , thereby bringing the C12 atom into closer contact with Val300 . Moreover , C22 of TX522 made an additional contact with the CD1 atom of Ile268 because of the rigidity of the triple bond-containing side chain . The position and conformation of the activation helix H12 of P11473 was strictly maintained . In conclusion , this study provides deeper insight into the docking of TX522 in the P18428 and shows that stronger P11473 -coactivator interactions underlie the superagonistic activity of the two 14-epi-analogs .
