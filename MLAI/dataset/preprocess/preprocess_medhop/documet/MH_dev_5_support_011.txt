New data integrating multitargeted antifolates into treatment of first-line and relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) represents approximately 80 % of all lung cancers . With modern platinum- based combination regimens , overall median survival has reached 9-12 months . Antifolates are active against several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies . The cytotoxic action of antifolates is mainly related to their ability to inhibit several different folate-dependent enzymes involved in DNA synthesis . DB00642 is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits at least 3 of the enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis : thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase ( P00374 ) , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) . DB00642 was approved for the treatment of relapsed NSCLC as it produced equivalent response and survival rates and less toxicity compared with docetaxel . DB00642 in combination with platinum analogues or with gemcitabine showed equivalent clinical impact compared with standard combinations of platinum plus third-generation agents . We analyze the potential implications of pemetrexed 's role in first-line chemotherapy of NSCLC as well as hints of differential cytotoxic action according to histology , new schedules of vitamin supplementation , and target enzymes expression levels . Issues of pharmacogenomics are becoming relevant in defining pemetrexed efficacy . Chemosensitivity was significantly linked to low levels of TS , GARFT , and P00374 in preclinical models . Consequently , the differential expression of TS according to histology might explain the different activity of pemetrexed according to histology , as recently postulated .
