Dopamine receptors D1 and D2 are related to observed maternal behavior . The dopamine pathway and especially the dopamine receptors 1 and 2 ( P21728 and P14416 ) are implicated in the regulation of mothering in rats . Evidence for this in humans is lacking . Here , we show that genetic variation in both P21728 and P14416 genes in a sample of 187 Caucasian mothers predicts variation in distinct maternal behaviors during a 30-min mother-infant interaction at 6 months postpartum . Two P21728 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs rs265981 and rs686 ) significantly associated with maternal orienting away from the infant ( P = 0.002 and P = 0.003 , respectively ) , as did P21728 haplotypes ( P = 0.03 ) . Two P14416 SNPs ( rs1799732 and rs6277 ) significantly associated with maternal infant-directed vocalizing ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.04 , respectively ) , as did P14416 haplotypes ( P = 0.01 ) . We present evidence for heterosis in P21728 where heterozygote mothers orient away from their infants significantly less than either homozygote group . Our findings provide important evidence that genetic variation in receptors critical for mothering in non-human species also affect human maternal behaviors . The findings also highlight the importance of exploring multiple dimensions of the complex human mothering phenotype .
