Identification of a novel pituitary-specific chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and its splice variants . In all vertebrates , DB00644 regulates gonadotropin secretion through binding to a specific receptor on the surface of pituitary gonadotropes . At least two forms of DB00644 exist within a single species , and several corresponding DB00644 receptors ( GNRHRs ) have been isolated with one form being pituitary specific . In chickens , only one type of widely expressed P30968 has previously been identified . The objectives of this study were to isolate a chicken pituitary-specific P30968 and to determine its expression pattern during a reproductive cycle . Using a combined strategy of PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) , a new P30968 ( chicken Q96P88 ) and two splice variants were isolated in domestic fowl ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) . Q8N1N2 -length Q96P88 and one of its splice variant mRNAs were expressed exclusively in the pituitary , whereas mRNA of the other splice variant was expressed in most brain tissues examined . The deduced amino acid sequence of full-length chicken Q96P88 reveals a seven transmembrane domain protein with 57 % -65 % homology to nonmammalian GNRHRs . Semiquantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNA levels of full-length chicken Q96P88 in the pituitary correlate with the reproductive status of birds , with maximum levels observed during the peak of lay and 4 wk postphotostimulation in females and males , respectively . Furthermore , DB00644 stimulation of GH3 cells that were transiently transfected with cDNA that encodes chicken Q96P88 resulted in a significant increase in inositol phosphate accumulation . In conclusion , we isolated a novel P30968 and its splice variants in chickens , and spatial and temporal gene expression patterns suggest that this receptor plays an important role in the regulation of reproduction .
