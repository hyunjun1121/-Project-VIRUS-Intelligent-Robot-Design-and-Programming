Functional analysis of human Q8TAX7 mucin gene 5'-flanking region in lung epithelial cells . The human Q8TAX7 gene encodes a low-molecular-mass mucin glycoprotein that functions in modulation of microbial flora in the oral cavity and respiratory tracts . Q8TAX7 gene expression is tissue- and cell-specific , with dominant expression in salivary gland acinar cells . To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for controlling Q8TAX7 gene expression , we analyzed the promoter activity of Q8TAX7 5'-flanking region in a human lung epithelial cell line A549 . We demonstrated that Q8TAX7 gene is expressed constitutively in this cell line and is upregulated by P01375 stimulation . The promoter activities of a 2,762-bp fragment of the human genomic DNA ( -2,732/+30 bp ) and its deletion series , subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector , were characterized at the basal level and under stimulation by P01375 . The results indicated that the minimal functional Q8TAX7 promoter is in the region of -138/+30 bp . This region also revealed the greatest increase in the promoter activity upon P01375 stimulation . Two putative P05412 -binding elements and one NF-kappaB-binding element were identified within the proximal promoter . Further analyses demonstrated that mutations of these elements dramatically reduced specific DNA-protein binding ability and reporter gene expression . P05412 elements played an essential role in the constitutive expression , while the NF-kappaB element was crucially important in the response to P01375 stimulation , demonstrating that P01375 activates Q8TAX7 transcription via NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
