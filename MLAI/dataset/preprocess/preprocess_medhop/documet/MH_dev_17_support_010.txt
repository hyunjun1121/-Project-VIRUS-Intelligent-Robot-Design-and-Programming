[ Medication of the month. DB08816 ( Brilique ) : potent oral antagonist of platelet activity ] . Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel combined with aspirin reduces ischemic events in acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) . The individual response to clopidogrel is , however , very variable from one subject to another , and the risk of events seems higher when platelet inhibition is insufficient . DB08816 is a potent oral inhibitor of platelet activity . It binds reversibly to the Q9H244 adenosine diphosphate . The platelet inhibition that it induces is faster and more pronounced than that of clopidogrel . In patients who have an ACS ( PLATO study ) with or without ST-segment elevation , treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel significantly reduced the rate of death from vascular causes , myocardial infarction , or stroke , without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding but with an increase in the rate of non-procedure-related bleeding . In Belgium , Brilique is currently indicated in combination with aspirin for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with ACS .
