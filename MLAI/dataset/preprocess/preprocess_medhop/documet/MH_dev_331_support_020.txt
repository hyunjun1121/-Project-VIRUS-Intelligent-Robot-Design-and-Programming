Cyclo-oxygenases and prostaglandins in acute inflammatory demyelination of the peripheral nerve . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the expression of cyclo-oxygenases ( P36551 ) , key enzymes in propagating inflammatory responses by converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins , in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . METHODS : Expression and distribution of P36551 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein were studied in sural nerve biopsies , serum , and P04141 samples from patients with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome ( GBS ) , chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) , or , for comparison , with vasculitic neuropathy ( VN ) , which is a inflammatory nondemyelinating disorder , and noninflammatory neuropathies ( Q8N4C6 ) using RT-PCR , immunohistochemistry , and immunoblotting . To confirm functional P35354 activity , the expression of prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) and prostaglandin F(2alpha) ( P49763 (2alpha) ) was evaluated by ELISA ex vivo and in vitro . RESULTS : Whereas P23219 expression was unaltered in all investigated groups , a significant upregulation of P35354 mRNA was detected in sural nerves from patients with GBS , CIDP , or VN but not in control subjects with noninflammatory disorders . Macrophages were identified as its primary cellular source . Increased P35354 protein levels were detectable in serum and P04141 from all patients with GBS and , in smaller numbers only , in samples from patients with CIDP or VN but not from the Q8N4C6 group studied . Moreover , increased levels of PGE(2) and P49763 (2alpha) were measurable in sera from patients with GBS , CIDP , or VN and in cell culture supernatants from in vitro stimulated macrophages , indicative of P35354 activity . CONCLUSIONS : Cyclo-oxygenase-2 , expressed by macrophages , may generate prostaglandins during acute inflammatory demyelination of the peripheral nerve .
