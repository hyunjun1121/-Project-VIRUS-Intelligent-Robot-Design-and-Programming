Inhibitory interactions between phosphorylation sites in the C terminus of Î±-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor P42261 subunits . The C terminus of AMPA-type glutamate receptor ( AMPAR ) P42261 subunits contains several phosphorylation sites that regulate AMPAR activity and trafficking at excitatory synapses . Although many of these sites have been extensively studied , little is known about the signaling mechanisms regulating P42261 phosphorylation at DB00156 -840 . Here , we report that neuronal depolarization in hippocampal slices induces a calcium and protein phosphatase 1/2A-dependent dephosphorylation of P42261 at DB00156 -840 and a nearby site at DB00133 -845 . Despite these similarities , inhibitors of DB01221 -type glutamate receptors and protein phosphatase 2B prevented depolarization-induced DB00133 -845 dephosphorylation but had no effect on DB00156 -840 dephosphorylation . Instead , depolarization-induced DB00156 -840 dephosphorylation was prevented by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels , indicating that distinct Ca(2+) sources converge to regulate P42261 dephosphorylation at DB00156 -840 and DB00133 -845 in separable ways . Results from immunoprecipitation/depletion assays indicate that DB00156 -840 phosphorylation inhibits protein kinase A ( PKA ) -mediated increases in DB00133 -845 phosphorylation . Consistent with this , PKA-mediated increases in AMPAR currents , which are dependent on DB00133 -845 phosphorylation , were inhibited in P29320 -293 cells expressing a DB00156 -840 phosphomimetic version of P42261 . Conversely , mimicking DB00133 -845 phosphorylation inhibited protein kinase C phosphorylation of DB00156 -840 in vitro , and PKA activation inhibited DB00156 -840 phosphorylation in hippocampal slices . Together , the regulation of DB00156 -840 and DB00133 -845 phosphorylation by distinct sources of Ca(2+) influx and the presence of inhibitory interactions between these sites highlight a novel mechanism for conditional regulation of AMPAR phosphorylation and function .
