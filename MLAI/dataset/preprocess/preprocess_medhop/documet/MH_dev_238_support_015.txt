The role of selectins and P05107 in leukotriene B4-mediated white blood cell emigration in human skin grafts transplanted on SCID mice . The purpose of this study was to examine the role of selectins and P05107 cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) in inflammation induced by injection of leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) into human skin . To accomplish this , the expression of CAMs and the ability of specific antibodies against CAMs to block white blood cell ( WBC ) transmigration were studied in an in vivo model consisting of human skin transplanted onto mice with the severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) mutation . The results indicate that LTB4-induced WBC transmigration in the human/SCID model is rapid and pronounced ; however , it is not accompanied by a significant upregulation of the baseline expression of endothelial P16109 , P16581 , P05362 or P19320 . An anti-murine P05107 mAb markedly inhibited white cell infiltration ( 89 % inhibition ) confirming the importance of beta 2 integrins in the process . The role of selectins was also examined . P61006 -14 , a bioactive antibody against murine P14151 inhibited transmigration by 66 % . A significant , but smaller , effect ( 39 % inhibition ) was observed by blocking P16581 function . These results indicate that LTB4-induced inflammation does not require upregulation of endothelial P62158 expression and , in contrast to P01375 alpha-induced transmigration , is only partially blocked by anti- P16581 antibodies .
