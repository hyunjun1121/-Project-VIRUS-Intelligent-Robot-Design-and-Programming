P00533 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) : the emerging role of the dual irreversible P00533 / P04626 inhibitor DB08916 . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is one of the most lethal types of cancer and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity worldwide . Despite improvements in conventional treatment for NSCLC , survival remains poor and improvements in patient outcome are warranted . Over recent years , basic scientific research has dramatically increased our knowledge of the pathogenesis of lung cancer and allowed us to uncover and understand the cellular pathways involved in this process . This has led to the development of therapies to selectively target these pathways . Among these , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase family and related downstream pathways play a critical role in cancer development and over recent years have become a validated target in NSCLC . The development of monoclonal antibodies and first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) targeted towards P00533 has had a considerable impact on patient outcomes . However , despite dramatic and sustained responses and the discovery of specific patient subgroups that may derive clinical benefit , resistance to first-generation P00533 TKIs inevitably develops . A new generation of agents have been developed to provide superior potency of target inhibition and further individualize the treatment of NSCLC . This article reviews P00533 -targeted therapies currently available for use and undergoing clinical development for the treatment of NSCLC , specifically focusing on next generation agents including DB08916 , an irreversible dual inhibitor of P00533 and P04626 kinases .
