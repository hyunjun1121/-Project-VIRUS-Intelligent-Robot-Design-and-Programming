Ameliorative Effect of a Selective Endothelin P25101 Receptor Antagonist in Rat Model of L- DB00134 -induced Vascular Dementia . The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of selective P25101 receptor antagonist , ambrisentan on hyperhomocysteinemia-induced experimental vascular dementia . L-methionine was administered for 8 weeks to induce hyperhomocysteinemia and associated vascular dementia in male rats . DB06403 was administered to L-methionine-treated effect rats for 4 weeks ( starting from 5(th) to 8(th) week of L-methionine treatment ) . On 52(nd) day onward , the animals were exposed to the Morris water maze ( MWM ) for testing their learning and memory abilities . Vascular endothelial function , serum nitrite/nitrate levels , brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species ( TBARS ) , brain reduced glutathione ( DB00143 ) levels , and brain acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) activity were also measured . L-methionine-treated animals showed significant learning and memory impairment , endothelial dysfunction , decrease in/serum nitrite/nitrate and brain DB00143 levels along with an increase in brain TBARS levels and P22303 activity . DB06403 significantly improved hyperhomocysteinemia-induced impairment of learning , memory , endothelial dysfunction , and changes in various biochemical parameters . These effects were comparable to that of donepezil serving as positive control . It is concluded that ambrisentan , a selective P25101 receptor antagonist may be considered as a potential pharmacological agent for the management of hyperhomocysteinemia-induced vascular dementia .
