Optimizing control of acromegaly : integrating a growth hormone receptor antagonist into the treatment algorithm . Acromegaly is associated with significant morbidities and a 2- to 3-fold increase in mortality because of the excessive metabolic action of GH and P05019 , a marker of GH output . Reductions in morbidity correspond with decreases in P05019 , and mortality is lowered following normalization of P05019 or GH levels . Therefore , this has become an important end point . Current guidelines for the treatment of acromegaly have not considered recent advances in medical therapy , in particular , the place of pegvisomant , a P10912 antagonist . Treatment goals include normalizing biochemical markers , controlling tumor mass , preserving pituitary function , and relieving signs and symptoms . Surgery reduces tumor volume and is considered first-line therapy . Radiation reduces tumor volume and GH and P05019 levels , but the onset of action is slow and hypopituitarism typically develops . Therefore , pharmacotherapy is often used following surgery or as first-line therapy for nonresectable tumors . Dopamine agonists can be considered in patients exhibiting minimal disease or those with GH-prolactin-cosecreting tumors but will not achieve hormone normalization in most patients . Somatostatin analogs effectively suppress GH and P05019 in most patients , but intolerance ( e.g. diarrhea , cramping , gallstones ) can occur . DB00082 , the newest therapeutic option , blocks GH action at peripheral receptors , normalizes P05019 levels , reduces signs and symptoms , and corrects metabolic defects . DB00082 does not appear to affect tumor size and has few adverse effects . DB00082 is the most effective drug treatment for acromegaly in normalizing P05019 and producing a clinical response ; it is the preferred agent in patients resistant to or intolerant of somatostatin analogs .
