Creating a genotype-based dosing algorithm for acenocoumarol steady dose . DB01418 is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant drug for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders in several countries . In counterpart of warfarin , there is scarce information about pharmacogenetic algorithms for steady acenocoumarol dose estimation . The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm of prediction for acenocoumarol.The algorithm was created using the data from 973 retrospectively selected anticoagulated patients and was validated in a second independent cohort adding up to 2,683 patients . The best regression model to predict stable dosage in the Primary Cohort included clinical factors ( age and body mass index , BSA ) and genetic variants ( Q9BQB6 , P11712 * and P78329 polymorphisms ) and explained up to 50 % of stable dose . In the validation study the clinical algorithm yielded an adjusted R²=0.15 ( estimation´s standard error=4.5 ) and the genetic approach improved the dose forecast up to 30 % ( estimation´s standard error=4.6 ) . Again , the best model combined clinical and genetic factors ( R² = 0.48 ; estimation´s standard error=4 ) which provided the best results of doses estimates within 20 % of the real dose in patients taking lower ( ≤ 7 mg/week ) or higher ( ≥ 25 mg/week ) acenocoumarol doses . In conclusion , we developed a prediction algorithm using clinical data and three polymorphisms in Q9BQB6 , P11712 * and P78329 genes that provided a steady acenocoumarol dose for about 50 % of patients in the Validation Cohort . Such algorithm was especially useful to patients who need higher or lower acenocoumarol doses , those patients with higher time required until their stabilisation and are more prone to suffer a treatment derived complication .
