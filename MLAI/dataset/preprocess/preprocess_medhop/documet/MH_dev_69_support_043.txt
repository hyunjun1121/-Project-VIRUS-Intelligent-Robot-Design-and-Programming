Dopamine selectively reduces GABA(B) transmission onto dopaminergic neurones by an unconventional presynaptic action . The functioning of midbrain dopaminergic neurones is closely involved in mental processes and movement . In particular the modulation of the inhibitory inputs on these cells might be crucial in controlling firing activity and dopamine ( DA ) release in the brain . Here , we report a concentration-dependent depressant action of dopamine on the GABA(B) IPSPs intracellularly recorded from dopaminergic neurones . Such effect was observed in spite of the presence of D(1)/ P14416 antagonists . A reduction of the GABA(B) IPSPs was also caused by noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) and by L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DB01235 ) , which is metabolically transformed into DA . The DA-induced depression of the IPSPs was partially antagonised by the alpha2 antagonists yohimbine and phentolamine . DA did not change the postsynaptic effects of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen , suggesting a presynaptic site of action . Furthermore , DA did not modulate the GABA(A)-mediated IPSP . The DA-induced depression of the GABA(B) IPSP occluded the depression produced by serotonin and was not antagonized by serotonin antagonists . The DA- and 5-HT-induced depression of the GABA(B) IPSP persisted when calcium and potassium currents were reduced in to the presynaptic terminals . These results describe an unconventional presynaptic , D(1) and D(2) independent action of DA on the GABA(B) IPSP . This might have a principal role in determining therapeutic/side effects of DB01235 and antipsychotics and could be also involved in drug abuse .
