Inhibition of HIV-associated reverse transcriptase by sugar-modified derivatives of thymidine 5'-triphosphate in comparison to cellular DNA polymerases alpha and beta . The sugar-modified dTTP analogues 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-thymidine 5'-triphosphate ( ddeTTP ) , 2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate ( ddTTP ) , 3'-fluorothymidine 5'-triphosphate ( FdTTP ) , and 3'-azidothymidine 5'-triphosphate ( N3dTTP ) are demonstrated to be very effective and selective inhibitors of the HIV-associated reverse transcriptase ( HIV-RT ) . This conclusion is based on a comparison of the ID50 values of the compounds for the HIV-RT ( ranging from 0.03 microM for ddeTTP to 0.1 microM for ddTTP ) and the cellular DNA polymerase alpha ( greater than 200 microM ) . P06746 is partially affected by N3dTTP ( ID50 = 31 microM ) and by the other analogues ( ID50 = 1-2.2 microM ) . FdTTP has proved as effective as N3dTTP ( ID50 = 0.05 microM ) in suppressing the HIV-RT activity . Kinetic analysis revealed for both dTTP analogues a competitive type of inhibition and the same P04264 values ( about 0.05 microM ) .
