Natriuretic peptide/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) system has inhibitory effects in renal fibrosis in mice . OBJECT : This study was designed to examine whether natriuretic peptide/natriuretic peptide receptor-A ( P16066 ) system attenuates renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) model and also examined the mechanism involved . METHODS : Three groups were studied : untreated UUO in wild-type mice ; untreated UUO in P16066 KO mice ; and P01160 treated ( 0.05 microg/kg/min ) UUO in wild-type mice . We measured histological and immunohistochemical findings ( alpha-SMA and F4/80 ) , tissue cGMP levels , various mRNA expression levels by real-time PCR analysis , and transcription factor levels ( AP-1 and NF-kappaB ) in renal tissue . RESULTS : Compared with wild-type UUO mice , NPRA-KO UUO mice had abnormal morphological findings ( fibrous area : +26 % , alpha-SMA expression : +30 % ) with lower tissue cGMP levels and increases in the mRNA expression levels of TGF-beta , collagen I , collagen III , P05121 , renin and angiotensinogen , whereas there were no differences in F4/80 positive cells or the mRNA expression levels of P05362 , osteopontin , or P13500 between the two groups . In contrast , P01160 pre-treatment significantly improved morphological changes with increase of tissue cGMP levels and reduction in the mRNA expression level of TGF-beta , collagen I , collagen III , P05121 , P05362 , osteopontin , P13500 , renin , and angiotensinogen . NPRA-KO UUO mice had higher AP-1 levels than wild-type UUO mice and P01160 pre-treatment reduced AP-1 and NF-kappaB activity . CONCLUSION : The endogenous natriuretic peptide/ P16066 system may inhibit renal fibrosis partly via inhibition of the angiotensin/AP-1/TGF-beta/collagen pathway and exogenous P01160 pre-treatment may inhibit it partly via both the angiotensin/AP-1/TGF-beta/collagen and NF-kappaB/inflammatory pathways .
