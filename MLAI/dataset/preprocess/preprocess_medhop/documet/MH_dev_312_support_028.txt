Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in Microsporum canis in inducing smooth skin and scalp tissue conditions . Microsporum canis is a common zoophilic dermatophyte , which causes a range of infections . To explore the pathogenic mechanism of tinea capitis , we used the suppression subtractive hybridization ( SSH ) technique to investigate the differences in gene expression between different cultures of Microsporum canis incubated on three different types of mineral media containing child glabrous skin , child scalp tissue and adult scalp tissue . Using dot-blot hybridization and real-time PCR technique , we successfully screened and identified a pair of genes that had expression levels 44.6 and 117 times higher in culture 1 ( M. canis cultured in mineral medium with child scalp tissue ) than in culture 2 ( M. canis cultured in mineral medium with glabrous skin tissue ) , and another pair of genes with expression levels 78.2 and 9.8 times higher in culture 1 than in culture 3 ( M. canis cultured in mineral medium with adult scalp tissue ) . These four genes were found to have 41 % , 53 % , 40 % and 94 % homology to those encoding a hypothetical protein [ family of serine hydrolases 1 ; ( FSH1 ) ] , PQ loop repeat protein ( PQ- Q14764 ) , a predicted protein [ porphyrin galactose 4 ; ( P-GAL4 ) ] and DB00157 dehydrogenase subunit ( DB00157 )1 , respectively . The upregulation of the FSH1 , PQ- Q14764 , P-GAL4 and P03886 genes in cultures of child scalp tissue indicates that they are essential in the pathogenesis of tinea capitis caused by M. canis .
