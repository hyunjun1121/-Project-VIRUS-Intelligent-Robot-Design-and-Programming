Novel dual targeting strategy with vandetanib induces tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in malignant pleural mesothelioma cells expressing P07949 oncogenic rearrangement . Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis , therefore development of novel effective therapies is urgent . In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of vandetanib ( DB05294 ) , an inhibitor of P35968 , P00533 and P07949 tyrosine kinases , in an orthotopic model of MPM . We found that a human MPM cell line , EHMES-10 , expressed P07949 /PTC3 oncogenic rearrangement and a large amount of P15692 . DB05294 induced the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of EHMES-10 cells in vitro ( IC(50)=0.3 microM ) . Once-daily oral treatment with vandetanib inhibited tumor angiogenesis , and reduced significantly the growth of thoracic tumors and the production of pleural effusions , resulting in the prolonged survival of mice in EHMES-10 orthograft model . In contrast , the selective P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor , gefitinib , had no effect against EHMES-10 cells both in vitro and in vivo . Our results suggest that using vandetanib to target P07949 -dependent tumor cell proliferation and survival and P35968 -dependent tumor angiogenesis may be promising against MPM expressing P07949 oncogenic rearrangement and P15692 .
