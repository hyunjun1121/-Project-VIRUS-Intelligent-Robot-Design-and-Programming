Suppression of parathyroid hormone-related protein messenger RNA expression by medroxyprogesterone acetate in breast cancer tissues . The level of parathyroid hormone-related protein ( P12272 ) expressed in breast cancer tissue is closely related to the incidence of bone metastasis . We examined the P12272 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues by coamplification polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) in mole ratio to internal standard beta-actin mRNA . The P12272 expression was higher in premenopausal patients than in postmenopausal patients ( P < 0.05 ) . More pronounced difference by menopause found in estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive groups ( P < 0.001 ) indicated that the P12272 expression in breast cancer tissue is hormonally regulated and might be altered by endocrine agents . To clarify the changes of P12272 expression by endocrine therapy of breast cancer , we measured P12272 expression in the breast cancer tissue incubated for 24 h with 1 x 10(-8) M of estradiol ( E2 ) , 1 x 10(-6) M of tamoxifen ( TAM ) and 1 x 10(-5) M of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DB00603 ) . The P12272 expression was decreased significantly by DB00603 ( P < 0.005 ) , while E2 and TAM did not change the P12272 expression . P06401 ( PgR ) mRNA expression was also examined to confirm that the breast cancer tissue responds to E2 and TAM . The results were well compatible with the better therapeutic effect of DB00603 reported for the treatment of breast cancer with bone metastases . As a potential candidate for the receptor that mediates the suppressive effect of DB00603 , androgen receptor ( AR ) is suggested most probable . Present results also demonstrated that the clinical response of individual tumors is closely associated with the early in vitro changes of gene expression detected in the cancer specimen .
