Dopamine controls systemic inflammation through inhibition of Q96P20 inflammasome . Inflammasomes are involved in diverse inflammatory diseases , so the activation of inflammasomes needs to be tightly controlled to prevent excessive inflammation . However , the endogenous regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation are still unclear . Here , we report that the neurotransmitter dopamine ( DA ) inhibits Q96P20 inflammasome activation via dopamine D1 receptor ( P21728 ) . P21728 signaling negatively regulates Q96P20 inflammasome via a second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( DB02527 ) , which binds to Q96P20 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Q9H992 . Importantly , in vivo data show that DA and P21728 signaling prevent Q96P20 inflammasome-dependent inflammation , including neurotoxin-induced neuroinflammation , LPS-induced systemic inflammation , and monosodium urate crystal ( MSU ) -induced peritoneal inflammation . Taken together , our results reveal an endogenous mechanism of inflammasome regulation and suggest P21728 as a potential target for the treatment of Q96P20 inflammasome-driven diseases .
