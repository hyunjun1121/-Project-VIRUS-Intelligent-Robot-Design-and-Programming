Histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment dramatically reduces cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C1 mutant human fibroblasts . Niemann-Pick type C ( NPC ) disease is predominantly caused by mutations in the O15118 protein that affect intracellular cholesterol trafficking and cause accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in lysosomal storage organelles . We report the use of a series of small molecule histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors in tissue culture models of NPC human fibroblasts . Some HDAC inhibitors lead to a dramatic correction in the NPC phenotype in cells with either one or two copies of the O15118 (I1061T) mutation , and for several of the inhibitors , correction is associated with increased expression of O15118 protein . Increased O15118 (I1061T) protein levels may partially account for the correction of the phenotype , because this mutant can promote cholesterol efflux if it is delivered to late endosomes and lysosomes . The HDAC inhibitor treatment is ineffective in an P61916 mutant human fibroblast line . Analysis of the isoform selectivity of the compounds used implicates Q13547 and/or Q92769 as likely targets for the observed correction , although other HDACs may also play a role . LBH589 ( DB06603 ) is an orally available HDAC inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is currently in phase III clinical trials for several types of cancer . It restores cholesterol homeostasis in cultured O15118 mutant fibroblasts to almost normal levels within 72 h when used at 40 nM . The findings that HDAC inhibitors can correct cholesterol storage defects in human O15118 mutant cells provide the potential basis for treatment options for NPC disease .
