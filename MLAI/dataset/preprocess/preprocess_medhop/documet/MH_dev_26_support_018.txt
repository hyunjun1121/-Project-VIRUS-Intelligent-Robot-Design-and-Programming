Activity and potential role of licofelone in the management of osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis . It is a progressive joint disease associated with aging . It may be found in the knees , hips , or other joints . It is estimated that costs associated with osteoarthritis exceed 2 % of the gross national product in developed countries . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory disease and are among the most widely used drugs worldwide . The main limitation in using NSAIDs consists in their side-effects , including gastrointestinal ulcerogenic activity and bronchospasm . The mechanism of action of these drugs is attributed to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) , and , consequently , the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins . It is hypothesized that the undesirable side-effects of NSAIDs are due to the inhibition of P23219 ( constitutive isoform ) , whereas the beneficial effects are related to the inhibition of P35354 ( inducible isoform ) . Arachidonic acid can also be converted to leukotrienes ( LTs ) by the action of P09917 ( 5- P28300 ) . DB04725 , a P28300 / P36551 competitive inhibitor , decreases the production ofproinflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins ( which are involved in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and in gastrointestinal ( GI ) damage induced by NSAIDs ) and has the potential to combine good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects with excellent GI tolerability . Preliminary data with this drug seem promising , but further well-designed clinical trials of this agent in the elderly will be necessary before a final evaluation is possible .
