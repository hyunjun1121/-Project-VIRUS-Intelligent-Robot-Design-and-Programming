Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations and gene expression in gastric cancer . Genomic copy number aberrations ( CNAs ) are believed to play a major role in the development and progression of human cancers . Although many CNAs have been reported in gastric cancer , their genome-wide transcriptional consequences are poorly understood . In this study , to reveal the impact of CNAs on genome-wide expression in gastric cancer , we analysed 30 cases of gastric cancers for their CNAs by array comparative genomic hybridization ( array CGH ) and 24 of these 30 cases for their expression profiles by oligonucleotide-expression microarray . We found that with the application of laser microdissection , most CNAs were detected at higher frequency than in previous studies . Notably , gain at 20q13 was detected in almost all cases ( 97 % ) , suggesting that this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer . By comparing the array CGH data with expression profiles of the same samples , we showed that both genomic amplification and deletion strongly influence the expression of genes in altered genomic regions . Furthermore , we identified 125 candidate genes , consisting of 114 up-regulated genes located in recurrent regions ( > 10 % ) of amplification and 11 down-regulated genes located in recurrent regions of deletion . Up-regulation of several candidate genes , such as Q99741 , P60059 , Q9BTT0 , Q13895 and P37268 , was confirmed by immunohistochemistry . Interestingly , some candidate genes were localized at genomic loci adjacent to well-known genes such as P00533 , P04626 and Q13485 , and concordantly deregulated by genomic alterations . Based on these results , we propose that our list of candidate genes may contain novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of advanced gastric cancer .
