Targeting androgen receptor in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer . Endocrine therapies for breast cancer that target the estrogen receptor ( ER ) are ineffective in the 25 % -30 % of cases that are ER negative ( ER- ) . P10275 ( AR ) is expressed in 60 % -70 % of breast tumors , independent of ER status . How androgens and AR regulate breast cancer growth remains largely unknown . We find that AR is enriched in ER- breast tumors that overexpress P04626 . Through analysis of the AR cistrome and androgen-regulated gene expression in ER-/ P04626 + breast cancers we find that AR mediates ligand-dependent activation of Wnt and P04626 signaling pathways through direct transcriptional induction of P56706 and P21860 . Specific targeting of AR , Wnt or P04626 signaling impairs androgen-stimulated tumor cell growth suggesting potential therapeutic approaches for ER-/ P04626 + breast cancers .
