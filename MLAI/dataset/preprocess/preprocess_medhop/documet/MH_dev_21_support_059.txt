DB00013 and its receptor in follicular and inflammatory cysts of the jaws . OBJECTIVE : Proteases are considered critical in peri-cystic tissue degradation required in jaw cyst expansion . We studied the expression of the plasminogen activation system ( plasminogen activators ; their inhibitor type-1 , P05121 ; the receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator , Q03405 ) in follicular and inflammatory cysts of the jaw , to identify a possible role of this system in jaw cyst enlargement . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Jaw cysts were collected by therapeutic enucleation . ELISA and casein zymography were used to measure and characterize plasminogen activators in cyst fluid . By immunohistochemistry we examined the presence of Q03405 in cyst walls and inflammatory cells , and by Western blotting the molecular forms of Q03405 within the cyst fluid . RESULTS : Inflammatory cysts fluid contained higher amounts of plasminogen activators of the urinary-type ( uPA ) , and lower amounts of P05121 , when compared to follicular cysts fluid . Epithelial layers of both types of cysts and inflammatory cells expressed Q03405 . Native 3-domain Q03405 was scarcely detectable within cysts , where its cleavage was accounted for by uPA . CONCLUSION : These data suggest a plasminogen activation-dependent mechanism of cyst enlargement , where only the outward Q03405 expressed on epithelial cells and on inflammatory cells direct the peri-cystic protease cascade , in a way similar to tumor enlargement within tissues .
