Hybrid molecules inhibiting myeloperoxidase activity and serotonin reuptake : a possible new approach of major depressive disorders with inflammatory syndrome . OBJECTIVES : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is accompanied with an imbalance in the immune system and cardiovascular impairments , such as atherosclerosis . Several mechanisms have been pointed out to underlie this rather unexpected association , and among them the activity of myeloperoxidase ( P05164 ) . The aim of our study was to find compounds that inhibit both P05164 and serotonin transporter ( P31645 ) for treating MDD associated with cardiovascular diseases . METHODS : P31645 inhibition was assessed with measuring of [ ( 3 ) H ] -serotonin uptake using P29320 -293 Q9UBK8 cells . P05164 inhibition was determined by taurine chloramine test on 3-(aminoalkyl)-5-fluoroindole derivatives and on clinically relevant antidepressants . All kinetic measurements were performed using a temperature-controlled stopped-flow apparatus ( model SX-18 MV ) . Promising lead compounds were docked onto P31645 3D structure modelled using the LeuT structure complexed to tryptophan ( PDB code 3F3A ) . Their toxicological profile was also assessed . KEY FINDINGS : 3-(aminoalkyl)-5-fluoroindole derivative with 5 carbons on the side chain and paroxetine showed the best activity on both P05164 and P31645 at the nanomolar range . Paroxetine was found to be the first irreversible P05164 inhibitor at nanomolar concentrations . CONCLUSIONS : Our results put forward the first hybrid molecule ( compound 25 ) and drug ( paroxetine ) that can be especially used in MDD associated with inflammatory syndrome .
