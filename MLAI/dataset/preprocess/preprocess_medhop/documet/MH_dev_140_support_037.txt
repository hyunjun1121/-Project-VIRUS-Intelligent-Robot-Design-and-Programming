DB01268 malate . Recently , there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) , such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( P09619 ) , stem cell factor receptor ( P10721 ) , and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( P36888 ) , in promoting tumor angiogenesis , tumor growth and metastasis . DB01268 ( sunitinib malate ; SU11248 ; SUTENT ; Pfizer Inc , New York , NY , USA ) is a novel , orally bio-available , oxindole , multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high binding affinity for VEGFR and P09619 which has shown anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities . This drug recently received approval from the US Food and Administration ( FDA ) in two indications simultaneously : advanced renal cell carcinoma ( adRCC ) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) , in patients who are resistant or intolerant to the treatment with imatinib . The present article reviews the recent pharmacologic and clinical data related to the use of this new promising drug in the field of oncology .
