DB00013 plasminogen activator receptor promotes macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall of ApoE deficient mice . The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( Q03405 ) regulates macrophage adhesion and migration by binding directly to matrix proteins and signaling through integrin complexes . In this study , we examined the role of Q03405 on macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall . Stable murine macrophage ( Raw264.7 ) cell lines expressing high levels of human Q03405 , human urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , or both were established using expression vectors driven by the human P34810 promoter . Stimulation with human uPA specifically induced phosphorylation of early response regulated kinase ( P29323 ) in cells expressing human Q03405 but not in sham transfected cells . The human Q03405 expressing Raw264.7 cells showed increased adhesion to both human uPA and vitronectin ( Vn ) . Raw264.7 cells expressing human Q03405 or both human Q03405 and uPA , but not uPA alone , were detected in the aortic wall of ApoE(-/-) mice , and no cells were detected in that of age-matched C57BL/6J mice after intravenous infusion of the cells . Blocking of Mac-1/ P05362 interaction by anti-alphaM antibody ( M1/70 ) significantly reduced the infiltration of huPAR-expressing Raw264.1 cells into aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice . Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with angiotensin II resulted in infiltration of Raw264.7 cells expressing human Q03405 . These data demonstrate that Q03405 plays a key role in promoting macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall of ApoE(-/-) mice .
