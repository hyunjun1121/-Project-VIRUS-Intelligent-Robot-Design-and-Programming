High biochemical selectivity of tadalafil , sildenafil and vardenafil for human phosphodiesterase 5A1 ( O76074 ) over PDE11A4 suggests the absence of PDE11A4 cross-reaction in patients . The physiological role of phosphodiesterase (PDE)11 is unknown and its biochemical characteristics are poorly understood . We have expressed human DB00117 -tagged PDE11A4 and purified the enzyme to apparent homogeneity . PDE11A4 displays K(m) values of 0.97 microM for cGMP and 2.4 microM for DB02527 , and maximal velocities were 4- to 10-fold higher for DB02527 than for cGMP . Given the homology between PDE11 and O76074 , we have compared the biochemical potencies of tadalafil ( DB00820 , Lilly- Q9Y6W8 ) , vardenafil ( DB00862 , Bayer-GSK ) , and sildenafil ( Viagra , Pfizer Inc. ) for PDE11A4 and PDE5A1 . PDE5A1/PDE11A4 selectivities are 40- , 9300- , and 1000-fold for tadalafil , vardenafil , and sildenafil , respectively . This suggests that none of these three compounds is likely to crossreact with PDE11A4 in patients .
