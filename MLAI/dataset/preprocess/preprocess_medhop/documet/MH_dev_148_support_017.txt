DB01095 inhibits growth and alters the malignant phenotype of the P13671 glioma cell line . BACKGROUND : DB01095 is a member of the family of P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) extensively used in medical practice . Increasing evidence suggests that fluvastatin may be implicated in suppression of cancer growth and development . The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer potential of fluvastatin in P13671 rat malignant glioma cells . METHODS : First , the effects of fluvastatin on cell viability ( MTT assay ) , proliferation ( BrdU assay ) , cell morphology , and cytoskeleton were examined . Subsequently , its effect on extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( P27361 /2 ) and P45983 and 2 ( JNK 1/2 ) expression was estimated by Western blot . Finally , the influence of fluvastatin on cell migration and production of P14780 and P15692 was determined using a wound-healing assay and ELISA test , respectively . RESULTS : The results obtained showed that fluvastatin had a remarkable inhibitory and cytotoxic effect on tumor P13671 cells ( IC(50) = 8.6 μM , 48 h ) , but did not inhibit the growth of normal neuronal cells . The concentrations from 1 to 10 μM induced marked morphologic alterations typical for apoptosis including shrinkage of cytoplasm , chromatin condensation , and nucleus breakdown . CONCLUSION : The inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on cell proliferation seemed to be associated with decreased p- P27361 /2 expression , upregulation of p- P45983 /2 , and reduction in the P14780 and P15692 concentrations in culture media . The high anticancer ( antiproliferative , proapoptotic , antiinvasive ) activity of fluvastatin and lack of its toxicity against normal cells indicate a potential use of this statin in the treatment of malignant glioma .
