Neurological deficits during treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists . INTRODUCTION : Neurological deficits that occur during treatment with tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -α antagonists are rare , and their clinical features have not been fully elucidated . METHODS : Retrospective review of medical records of 9 patients who were given P01375 -α antagonists , subsequently developed neurological deficits and were cared for at the Medical University of South Carolina between January 2002 and May 2010 . Adverse drug reaction probability scale was used for the assessment of their causal connection . RESULTS : The underlying diseases for which P01375 -α antagonists were administered included rheumatologic disorders ( 4 ) , sarcoidosis ( 3 ) , psoriasis ( 1 ) and Crohn 's disease ( 1 ) . DB00005 , infliximab or adalimumab was administered to these patients . Neurological complications included central or peripheral demyelination ( 5 ) , antiphospholipid syndrome/central nervous system lupus ( 1 ) , Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis ( 1 ) , axonal sensory polyneuropathy ( 1 ) and small fiber polyneuropathy ( 1 ) . P01375 -α antagonists were discontinued in 8 patients and clinical improvement was seen in 3 of them . Additional therapies were given in 4 patients . An adverse drug reaction probability score suggested probable ( 3/9 ) and possible ( 6/9 ) causal relationships . CONCLUSIONS : Neurological deficits that develop during treatment with P01375 -α antagonists are relatively rare but important potential complications of these drugs . Determining if the relationship between the neurological deficits and P01375 -α antagonist therapy is causal can be challenging and can impact patient care .
