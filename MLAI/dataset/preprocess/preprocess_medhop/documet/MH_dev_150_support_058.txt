P10275 is responsible for rat organic cation transporter 2 gene regulation but not for rOCT1 and rOCT3 . PURPOSE : Organic cation transporters 1-3 ( OCT1-3 ; Slc22a1-3 ) mediate the membrane transport of organic cations in the kidney . We previously reported that rat (r)OCT2 expression in the kidney was regulated by testosterone . In this study , we examined the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the testosterone-dependent regulation of rOCT2 expression . METHODS : Approximately 3000-bp fragments of the rOCT1-3 promoter region were isolated , and promoter activities were measured in the renal epithelial cell line LLC- P30613 with the coexpression of rat androgen receptor . RESULTS : Among reporter constructs tested , only rOCT2 promoter activity was stimulated by testosterone . This stimulation was suppressed by nilutamide , an antiandrogen drug . Reporter assays using deletion constructs and mutational constructs of putative androgen response elements ( ARE ) in the rOCT2 promoter region suggested that two AREs , located at approximately -3000 and -1300 , respectively , play an important role in the induction by testosterone . CONCLUSIONS : DB00624 induces the expression of rOCT2 , but not of rOCT1 and rOCT3 , via the AR-mediated transcriptional pathway . This is the first study to address the transcriptional mechanisms of testosterone-dependent gene regulation of the Slc22 family .
