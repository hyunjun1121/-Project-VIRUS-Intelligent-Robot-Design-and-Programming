P48061 inhibits expression of the DB01221 receptor 's Q13224 subunit through a histone deacetylase-dependent pathway contributing to neuronal survival . Homeostatic chemokines , such as P48061 , can affect neuronal activity by the regulation of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission , but the mechanisms involved are still undefined . Our previous studies have shown that P48061 protects cortical neurons from excitotoxicity by promoting the function of the gene-repressor protein Rb , which is involved in the recruitment of chromatin modifiers ( such as histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) ) to gene promoters . In neurons , Rb controls activity-dependent genes essential to neuronal plasticity and survival , such as the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( DB01221 ) receptor 's subunit Q13224 , the expression of which in the tetrameric ion channel largely affects calcium signaling by glutamate . In this study , we report that P48061 differentially modulates intracellular responses after stimulation of synaptic and extrasynaptic DB01221 receptors , by a specific regulation of the Q13224 gene that involves HDACs . Our results show that P48061 selectively inhibits Q13224 expression in vitro and in vivo altering DB01221 -induced calcium responses associated with neuronal death , while promoting prosurvival pathways that depend on stimulation of synaptic receptors . Along with previous studies , these findings underline the role of P48061 / P61073 in the regulation of crucial components of glutamatergic transmission . These novel effects of P48061 may be involved in the physiological function of the chemokine in both developing and mature brains .
