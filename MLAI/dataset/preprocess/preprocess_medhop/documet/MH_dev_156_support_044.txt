DB01240 is a specific effector of adipose cell differentiation . Its dual role as a DB02527 - and Ca(2+)-elevating agent . The mitogenic-adipogenic activity of carbaprostacyclin ( cPGI2 ) , a stable analogue of prostacyclin ( DB01240 ) , has been proposed to be related to its ability to elicit DB02527 production and to activate the protein kinase A cascade ( NÃ©grel , R. , Gaillard , D. , and Ailhaud , G. ( 1989 ) Biochem. J. 257 , 399-405 ) . In the present study , cPGI2 has been compared with other activators of the DB02527 pathway , namely isoproterenol , forskolin and 8-bromo- DB02527 , with respect to adipose cell differentiation . Carbaprostacyclin behaved as a much more potent and efficient effector of mouse Ob1771 preadipocyte differentiation than the latter agents . Moreover , cPGI2 also exerted a specific amplifying mitogenic-adipogenic role , as compared with isoproterenol in rat as well as human adipose precursor cells in primary culture , suggesting that the prostanoid was able to generate an additional second messenger . The fact that ionomycin was able to potentiate and amplify the differentiation induced by 8-bromo- DB02527 led us to give evidence , using preadipocytes preloaded with the fluorescent calcium chelator Indo-1 , that cPGI2 , besides its ability to activate adenyl cyclase , was also able to induce a transient increase in intracellular free calcium . This phenomenon was independent of DB02527 production or inositol phospholipid breakdown and appeared to be mediated after binding to a single class of P43119 . The potential to generate simultaneously two synergistic intracellular signals allows us to ascribe to DB01240 a key and specific role in the differentiation of adipose precursor cells in vitro that would likely lead in vivo to the recruitment of " dormant " preadipocytes to become adipocytes .
