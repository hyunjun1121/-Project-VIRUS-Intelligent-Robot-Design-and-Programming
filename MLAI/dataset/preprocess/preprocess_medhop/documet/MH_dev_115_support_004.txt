DB08877 , a selective P23458 and O60674 inhibitor for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and psoriasis . DB08877 ( INCB-018424 ) is a potent , orally available , selective inhibitor of both P23458 and O60674 of the JAK- P35610 signaling pathway , being developed by Incyte Corp and Novartis AG . DB08877 was initially developed to target the constitutive activation of the JAK- P35610 pathway in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs ) . Meaningful reductions in spleen size and constitutional symptoms have been noted in patients with myelofibrosis ( both primary and post-essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera ) . Data from a phase I/II clinical trial led to ongoing registration trials in the US and Europe . Toxicity ( primarily decreased erythropoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis ) has been managed by close control of dosing . The inhibition of inflammatory cytokine signaling through P23458 inhibition has led to intriguing results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis ( using a topical cream formulation ) . DB08877 is a well tolerated , first-in-class O60674 inhibitor with various potential clinical indications .
