Simultaneous inhibition of MEK and P11802 leads to potent apoptosis in human melanoma cells . ABSTRACT Deregulation of DB01367 -RAF-MEK- P29323 and P42771 -cycylin D: P11802 /6-RB pathways is important for melanoma development . Chemotherapeutic agents targeting both pathways were developed but results of clinical studies with monotherapies were disappointing . We examined the effect of co-targeting both pathways with MEK inhibitor PD98059 and P11802 inhibitor 219476 on human melanoma cells lines , and found that combinatorial treatment dramatically increased apoptosis compared to the single agent treatment . The apoptosis was associated with downregulation of P10415 , Q07817 , O15392 , and upregulation of O43521 . Our results indicate that simultaneously targeting P29323 and RB pathways is a promising strategy for melanoma treatment and should encourage further in-depth investigations .
