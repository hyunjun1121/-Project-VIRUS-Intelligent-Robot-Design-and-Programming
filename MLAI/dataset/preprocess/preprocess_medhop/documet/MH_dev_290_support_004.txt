Activation of the succinate receptor Q9BXA5 in macula densa cells causes renin release . Macula densa ( MD ) cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus ( JGA ) are salt sensors and generate paracrine signals that control renal blood flow , glomerular filtration , and release of the prohypertensive hormone renin . We hypothesized that the recently identified succinate receptor Q9BXA5 is present in MD cells and regulates renin release . Using immunohistochemistry , we identified Q9BXA5 in the apical plasma membrane of MD cells . Treatment of MD cells with succinate activated mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ; p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( P35354 ) and induced the synthesis and release of prostaglandin E(2) , a potent vasodilator and classic paracrine mediator of renin release . Using microperfused JGA and real-time confocal fluorescence imaging of quinacrine-labeled renin granules , we detected significant renin release in response to tubular succinate ( EC(50) 350 microM ) . Genetic deletion of Q9BXA5 ( Q9BXA5 (-/-) mice ) or pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK or P35354 blocked succinate-induced renin release . DB00428 -induced diabetes caused Q9BXA5 -dependent upregulation of renal cortical phospho-p38 , extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 , P35354 , and renin content . Salt depletion for 1 wk increased plasma renin activity seven-fold in wild-type mice but only 3.4-fold in Q9BXA5 (-/-) mice . In summary , MD cells can sense alterations in local tissue metabolism via accumulation of tubular succinate and Q9BXA5 signaling , which involves the activation of MAPKs , P35354 , and the release of prostaglandin E(2) . This mechanism may be integral in the regulation of renin release and activation of the renin-angiotensin system in health and disease .
