Association of genetic polymorphisms with personality profile in individuals without psychiatric disorders . OBJECTIVE : Population-based twin studies demonstrate that approximately 40-50 % of the variability in personality dimensions results from genetic factors . This study assessed selected polymorphisms in the P21964 Val158Met , P21397 3'VNTR , 5HTTLPR , 102T/C 5- Q13049 , Q01959 3'VNTR and P14416 exon 8 genes and evaluated their association with personality profiles , anxiety levels , and depressiveness in healthy subjects . METHODS : This study included 406 unrelated ( mean age 38.51 years ) , mentally and somatically healthy Caucasian subjects of Polish origin . The prevalence of the gene variants mentioned above and their association with personality profiles , anxiety levels , and depressiveness was assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory , NEO Five-Factor Inventory , Spielberger 's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck 's Depression Inventory . RESULTS : The effects of the 5HTTLPR gene on the s/s genotype and empathy ( P06681 ) were lowest in the entire group . The effects of gender , age and the Q13049 gene for the T/T genotype and attachment ( Q7Z3Z2 ) were highest in women . The effects of gender , age and the Q01959 gene on the 9/9 Q01959 genotype , compassion ( C4 ) and cooperativeness ( C ) were lowest in women . The effects of gender , age and the P21964 gene on the DB00134 / DB00134 genotype and neuroticism ( P04626 ) NEO-FFI were also lowest in women . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest considerable influence of individual genes on the formation of personality traits .
