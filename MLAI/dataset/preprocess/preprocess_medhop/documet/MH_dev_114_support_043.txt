In vitro effects of E3040 , a dual inhibitor of P09917 and thromboxane A(2) synthetase , on eicosanoid production . In vitro pharmacological profiles of E3040 , 6-hydroxy-5 , 7-dimethyl-2-(methylamino)-4-(3-pyridylmethyl) benzothiazole were investigated . Against the P09917 activity of rat basophilic leukemia cells , E3040 and zileuton ( a P09917 inhibitor ) had an IC(50) of 0.23 and 0.93 microM , respectively . Against the thromboxane A(2) synthetase activity of human platelets , E3040 had an IC(50) of 0.01 microM , which was comparable to that of OKY-1581 ( sodium ( E ) -3- [ 4-(3-pyridylmethyl) phenyl ] -2-methylacrylate , a thromboxane A(2) synthetase inhibitor ) . Against cyclooxygenase activity of sheep seminal vesicles , E3040 showed no inhibition ( IC(50) , > 300 microM ) . Sulfasalazine and DB00244 , therapeutic drugs for inflammatory bowel disease , inhibited P09917 activity with an IC(50) of 293 and 970 microM , respectively . Sulfasalazine inhibited thromboxane A(2) synthetase activity with an IC(50) of 20 microM . In rat peritoneal leukocytes , E3040 inhibited leukotriene B(4) and thromboxane B(2) production with an IC(50) of 0.17 and 0.24 microM , respectively . E3040 inhibited leukotriene B(4) production in human neutrophils and thromboxane B(2) production in human platelets ( IC(50) of 0.21 and 0.09 microM , respectively ) . These results indicated that E3040 potently inhibited P09917 and thromboxane A(2) synthetase and blocked leukotriene B(4) and thromboxane B(2) production in rat peritoneal and human blood cells .
