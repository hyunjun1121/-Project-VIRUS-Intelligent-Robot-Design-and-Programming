Use of a collagen biomatrix ( TissuDura ) for dura repair : a long-term neuroradiological and neuropathological evaluation . PURPOSE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical , neuroradiological , and neuropathological outcomes of patients treated with equine collagen foil ( TissuDura ) as a dura mater substitute during cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures . MATERIALS AND METHODS : All patients treated at the Department of Neurosurgery of the Second University of Naples with TissuDura between 2005 and 2009 were included . Dural reconstruction was performed using TissuDura , overlaid 1 cm over the dural defect with additional fixation using fibrin glue . No surgical sutures were used . Patients underwent postoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance scans at 1 week , 1 month , and 1 year after surgery to detect any cerebrospinal fluid ( P04141 ) leaks , infections , inflammations , or P04141 circulation in the surgical region . RESULTS : Dural reconstruction was performed in 74 patients , including 50 patients with tumors , two with P06681 neurinoma , two with acoustic neurinoma , six with Chiari I malformation , two with severe head injury , and 12 requiring spinal surgery . Clinical and neuroradiological findings were normal and no signs of graft rejection or P04141 leaks at postoperative follow-up were observed . In two cases of atypical meningioma , re-operation of the dural reconstruction was performed after 1 year . No adherences between brain and neodura were detected , and histopathological investigations demonstrated dural regeneration . CONCLUSIONS : Following dural reconstructions with TissuDura without surgical sutures , no local toxicity or complications were observed for up to 1 year . TissuDura demonstrated elasticity , non-reactivity , and good adaptability . The overlay technique using fibrin glue was simple and fast . Future studies and longer follow-up are needed to confirm the efficacy of TissuDura .
