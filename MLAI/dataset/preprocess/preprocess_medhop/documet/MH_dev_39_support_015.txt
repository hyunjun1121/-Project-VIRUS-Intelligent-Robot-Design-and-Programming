Phosphorylation of the P81877 and P00519 proteins by the Q9UBW7 - P11362 fusion kinase seen in atypical myeloproliferative disorders as revealed by phosphopeptide-specific MS . The Q9UBW7 -fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( P11362 ) fusion kinase is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase associated with a specific atypical myeloproliferative disease . The chimeric protein localizes to the cytoplasm , unlike the wild type P11362 receptor kinase , and presumably inappropriately phosphorylates specific targets as part of the oncogenic signaling cascade . Other than known targets of the P11362 kinase itself , few specific targets of Q9UBW7 - P11362 have been identified . Using a genetically engineered P29320 293 cell system , we have identified proteins that are specifically phosphorylated in the presence of the fusion kinase using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and MS . Compared with 293 cells expressing exongenous wild type P11362 , Q9UBW7 - P11362 is associated with phosphorylation of several proteins including P81877 , P00519 , FLJ14235 , CALM and Q9C037 proteins . The specificity of the phosphorylation events in the P81877 and P00519 proteins , which have previously been implicated in leukemogenesis , was further confirmed independently using immunoprecipitation with protein-specific antibodies and Western blotting . The MS analysis also identified the phosphorylation events in the Q9UBW7 moiety in the chimeric protein that might be related to its function . These studies identify the intersection of several different leukemia-related pathways in the development of this myeloproliferative disorder and provide new insights into the substrates of P11362 under defined conditions .
