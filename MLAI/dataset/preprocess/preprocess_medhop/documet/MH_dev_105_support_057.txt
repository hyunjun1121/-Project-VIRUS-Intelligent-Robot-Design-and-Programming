Integration of P00533 inhibitors and conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer . INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND : Given the limited gains of traditional chemotherapy in improving outcomes in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , recent research efforts have investigated the integration of targeted agents into the treatment algorithm . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Searches of PubMed and of recent results from key oncology congresses were performed to identify relevant articles and abstracts . Initial phase III trials combining the reversible epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) gefitinib and erlotinib with platinum-based doublets as first-line therapy failed to demonstrate an overall survival advantage in unselected patients with NSCLC . However , in recent years , there has been substantial progress in understanding the determinants of response to P00533 TKI therapy , including the presence of activating P00533 mutations , which has been reflected in clinical trials specifically evaluating these patient populations . In addition , evidence suggesting potential mechanistic interference between concurrent P00533 TKIs and chemotherapy has also been observed , fueling interest in sequential or intermittent dosing . P00533 -targeted agents such as the multitargeted TKI vandetanib and the next-generation P00533 TKIs afatinib ( DB08916 ) and PF00299804 are also under clinical investigation for the treatment of NSCLC , both alone and in combination with chemotherapy . CONCLUSIONS : Trials evaluating various regimens of P00533 -targeted agents and chemotherapy are planned and/or underway and will hopefully define the role of integrated therapy in NSCLC .
