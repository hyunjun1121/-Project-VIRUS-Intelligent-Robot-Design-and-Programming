Extracellular control of O76095 localization during asymmetric cell division in the C. elegans embryo . The axis of asymmetric cell division is controlled to determine the future position of differentiated cells during animal development . The asymmetric localization of PAR proteins in the Drosophila neuroblast and C. elegans embryo are aligned with the axes of the embryo . However , whether extracellular or intracellular signals determine the orientation of the localization of PAR proteins remains controversial . In C. elegans , the P0 zygote and germline cells ( P1 , P2 , and P09131 ) undergo a series of asymmetric cell divisions . Interestingly , the axis of the P0 and P1 divisions is opposite to that of the P2 and P09131 divisions . P55085 , a ring-finger protein , and P25116 , a kinase , relocalize to the anterior side of the P2 and P09131 germline precursors at the site of contact with endodermal precursors . Using an in vitro method , we have found that the P55085 protein is distributed asymmetrically in the absence of extracellular signals , but the orientation of the protein localization in the P2 and P09131 cells is determined by contact with endodermal precursor cells . Our mutant analyses suggest that mes-1 and src-1 , which respectively encode a transmembrane protein and a tyrosine kinase , were not required to establish the asymmetric distribution of P55085 , but were required to determine its orientation at the site of contact with the endodermal precursors . The P55085 localization during the asymmetric P2 and P09131 divisions is controlled by extracellular signals via MES-1/ Q15788 signaling . Our findings suggest that Src functions as an evolutionarily conserved molecular link that coordinates extrinsic cues with O76095 localization .
