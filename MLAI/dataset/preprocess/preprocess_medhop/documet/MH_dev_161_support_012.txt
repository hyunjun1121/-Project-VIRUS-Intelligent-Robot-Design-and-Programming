Phase I study of PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in combination with topotecan in adults with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas . A phase I trial of ABT-888 ( veliparib ) , a PARP inhibitor , in combination with topotecan , a topoisomerase I-targeted agent , was carried out to determine maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) , safety , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of the combination in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas . Varying schedules and doses of intravenous topotecan in combination with ABT-888 ( 10 mg ) administered orally twice a day ( P55957 ) were evaluated . Plasma and urine pharmacokinetics were assessed and levels of poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) and the DNA damage marker γ P16104 were measured in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . Twenty-four patients were enrolled . Significant myelosuppression limited the ability to coadminister ABT-888 with standard doses of topotecan , necessitating dose reductions . Preclinical studies using athymic mice carrying human tumor xenografts also informed schedule changes . The MTD was established as topotecan 0.6 mg/m²/d and ABT-888 10 mg P55957 on days one to five of 21-day cycles . DB01030 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 . A more than 75 % reduction in PAR levels was observed in 3 paired tumor biopsy samples ; a greater than 50 % reduction was observed in PBMCs from 19 of 23 patients with measurable levels . Increases in γ P16104 response in circulating tumor cells ( CTC ) and PBMCs were observed in patients receiving ABT-888 with topotecan . We show a mechanistic interaction of a PARP inhibitor , ABT-888 , with a topoisomerase I inhibitor , topotecan , in PBMCs , tumor , and CTCs . Results of this trial reveal that PARP inhibition can modulate the capacity to repair topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage in the clinic .
