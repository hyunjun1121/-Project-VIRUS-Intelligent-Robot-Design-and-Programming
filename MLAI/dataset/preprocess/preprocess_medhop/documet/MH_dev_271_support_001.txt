Costimulation of T cell receptor-triggered P60568 production by Jurkat T cells via fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 upon its engagement by CD56 . Recent studies have demonstrated that neural cell adhesion molecule ( P13591 ) is involved in multiple adhesive interactions with several different classes of ligands on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix . One of these ligands is fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) that is expressed on neural cells . While it is known that CD56 is a molecular isoform of P13591 expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T cells , it remains poorly characterized , with its ligand unidentified . Therefore , we were prompted to examine if CD56 molecules on NK cells interact with FGFR expressed on T cells . We demonstrate that ligation of P11362 beta on J. P06681 -14 Jurkat T cells by CD56 on fixed NK-92 cells costimulates TCR/CD3-triggered P60568 production . CD56-binding mAbs inhibited the costimulatory effect of NK-92 cells in 50-75 % . Flow cytometric analysis and cell adhesion assays showed that P11362 beta/Fc and P21802 beta/Fc chimeric proteins bind to NK-92 cells . The binding of P11362 beta/Fc protein to CD56 molecules was verified by immunoprecipitation of CD56 with anti-CD56 mAb followed by Western blotting with P11362 beta/Fc . These findings suggest that ligation of P11362 by CD56 may contribute to the interaction between NK cells and T cells that we have postulated in our previous studies .
