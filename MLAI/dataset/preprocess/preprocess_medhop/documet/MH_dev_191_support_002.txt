SynGAP regulates protein synthesis and homeostatic synaptic plasticity in developing cortical networks . Disrupting the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the developing brain has been causally linked with intellectual disability ( ID ) and autism spectrum disorders ( P51689 ) . Excitatory synapse strength is regulated in the central nervous system by controlling the number of postsynaptic Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPARs ) . De novo genetic mutations of the synaptic P20936 ( SynGAP ) are associated with ID and P51689 . SynGAP is enriched at excitatory synapses and genetic suppression of SynGAP increases excitatory synaptic strength . However , exactly how SynGAP acts to maintain synaptic AMPAR content is unclear . We show here that SynGAP limits excitatory synaptic strength , in part , by suppressing protein synthesis in cortical neurons . The data presented here from in vitro , rat and mouse cortical networks , demonstrate that regulation of translation by SynGAP involves P29323 , P42345 , and the small Q15382 . Furthermore , these data show that Q13224 -containing NMDARs and the cognitive kinase CaMKII act upstream of SynGAP and that this signaling cascade is required for proper translation-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses in developing cortical networks .
