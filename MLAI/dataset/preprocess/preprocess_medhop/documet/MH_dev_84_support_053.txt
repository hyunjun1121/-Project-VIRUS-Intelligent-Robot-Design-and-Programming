Antitumor effect and antiangiogenic potential of the P42345 inhibitor temsirolimus against malignant pleural mesothelioma . The P42345 inhibitor temsirolimus has antitumor and antiangiogenic activity against several carcinomas , yet few reports document the efficacy of temsirolimus against malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) . Therefore , we evaluated the efficacy of temsirolimus and the antiangiogenic effect of temsirolimus in the treatment of MPM . We examined the efficacy of temsirolimus alone and the efficacy of the combination of temsirolimus and cisplatin or pemetrexed against four MPM cell lines using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . The effect of temsirolimus on the production of proangiogenic cytokines by MPM cell lines was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Expression of P42345 and proangiogenic cytokines in clinical specimens from MPM patients was determined by immunohistochemistry . DB06287 inhibited cell viability and suppressed cell proliferation of all MPM cell lines . Combined treatment with temsirolimus and cisplatin inhibited the viability of all MPM cell lines more effectively than temsirolimus alone . DB06287 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of p70s6k , a downstream molecule of P42345 , in all MPM cell lines and led to an increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 in the H226 and Y-meso14 cells . DB06287 also inhibited the production of vascular endothelial growth factor ( P15692 ) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA ( PDGF-AA ) . Phosphorylated P42345 and high expression of P15692 and PDGF were detected in 2 and 3 , respectively , out of the 5 MPM specimens . These results suggest that temsirolimus has activity against MPM cells by inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis , and may be beneficial for a subset of MPM patients with high P42345 expression .
