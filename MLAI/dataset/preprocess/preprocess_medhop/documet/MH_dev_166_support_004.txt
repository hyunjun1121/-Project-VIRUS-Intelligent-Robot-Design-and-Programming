Molecular mechanisms of cell proliferation induced by low power laser irradiation . Low power laser irradiation ( LPLI ) promotes proliferation of multiple cells , which ( especially red and near infrared light ) is mainly through the activation of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the initiation of cellular signaling . Recently , the signaling proteins involved in LPLI-induced proliferation merit special attention , some of which are regulated by mitochondrial signaling . P08581 ( c- DB00134 ) , a member of tyrosine protein kinase receptors ( TPKR ) , is phosphorylated during LPLI-induced proliferation , but tumor necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) receptor has not been affected . Activated TPKR could activate its downstream signaling elements , like Ras/Raf/MEK/ P29323 , PI3K/Akt/ P06730 , PI3K/Akt/ P29474 and P98160 -gamma/PKC pathways . Other two pathways , DeltaPsim/ DB00171 / DB02527 /JNK/AP-1 and ROS/Src , are also involved in LPLI-induced proliferation . LPLI-induced cell cycle progression can be regulated by the activation or elevated expressions of cell cycle-specific proteins . Furthermore , LPLI induces the synthesis or release of many molecules , like growth factors , interleukins , inflammatory cytokines and others , which are related to promotive effects of LPLI .
