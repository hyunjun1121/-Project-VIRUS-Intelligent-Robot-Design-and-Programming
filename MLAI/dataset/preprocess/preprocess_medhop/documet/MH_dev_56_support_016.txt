Characterization of the immune response in the synovitis , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis ( SAPHO ) syndrome . OBJECTIVE : The aetiology of SAPHO ( synovitis , acne , palmoplantar pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis ) syndrome seems to involve genetic , infectious and immunological components . We examined innate and adaptive immune responses in SAPHO syndrome , as compared with PsA and RA . We also studied the effect of etanercept on immunological parameters . METHODS : We studied 29 patients with SAPHO syndrome , as well as 22 patients with RA , 21 patients with PsA and 15 healthy controls . Adaptive immune responses were investigated by assaying total serum immunoglobulins and several autoantibodies . Innate immunity was studied by quantifying blood PMN functions and plasma cytokine levels . PMN responses to Propionibacterium acnes were tested ex vivo . Eight patients who received etanercept for refractory rheumatic disorders were tested before and after 28 days of treatment . RESULTS : SAPHO syndrome was associated with elevated P10145 and Q14116 plasma levels . P10145 and P01375 production by purified PMN was higher in the three patient groups than in the healthy controls , but the oxidative burst and Q14116 production were normal . No autoantibodies were detected in SAPHO patients . Induction of PMN P10145 and P01375 production by P. acnes was impaired in the SAPHO group as compared with the RA and PsA groups . After 28 days of etanercept therapy , PMN P10145 and P01375 production was down-regulated and P01375 plasma levels were increased . CONCLUSIONS : These results support the view that the SAPHO syndrome may be triggered by an infectious state involving P. acnes , contributing to the strong humoral and cellular pro-inflammatory responses . DB00005 modulation of PMN activation status emphasizes these new immunological findings .
