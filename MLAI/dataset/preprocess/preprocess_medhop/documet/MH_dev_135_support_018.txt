Novel target for induction of apoptosis by cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor SC-236 through a protein kinase C-beta(1)-dependent pathway . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancers . Recently , a similar protective effect has been demonstrated by the specific cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) inhibitors . However , the exact mechanism that accounts for the anti-proliferative effect of specific P35354 inhibitors is still not fully understood , and it is still controversial whether these protective effects are predominantly mediated through the inhibition of P35354 activity and prostaglandin synthesis . Identification of molecular targets regulated by P35354 inhibitors could lead to a better understanding of their pro-apoptotic and anti-neoplastic activities . In the present study , we investigated the effect and the possible molecular target of a P35354 -specific inhibitor SC-236 on gastric cancer . We showed that SC-236 induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells . However , this effect was not dependent on P35354 inhibition . SC-236 down-regulated the protein expression and kinase activity of P05771 (1) , increased the expression of PKCdelta and PKCeta , but did not alter the expression of other PKC isoforms in AGS cells . Moreover , exogenous prostaglandins or PGE(2) receptor antagonists could not reverse the inhibition effect on PKCbeta(1) by SC-236 , which suggested that this effect occurred through a mechanism independent of cyclo-oxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis . Overexpression of PKCbeta(1) attenuated the apoptotic response of AGS cells to SC-236 and was associated with overexpression of P38936 (waf1/cip1) . Inhibition of PKCbeta(1)-mediated overexpression of P38936 (waf1/cip1) partially reduced the anti-apoptotic effect of PKCbeta(1) . The down-regulation of PKCbeta(1) provides an explanation for P36551 -independent apoptotic effects of specific P35354 inhibitor in cultured gastric cancer cells . We also suggest that PKCbeta(1) act as survival mediator in gastric cancer , and its down-regulation by P35354 inhibitor SC-236 may provide new target for future treatment of gastric cancer .
