delta(9)- DB00470 increases nerve growth factor production by prostate PC-3 cells . Involvement of P21554 cannabinoid receptor and P04049 . Cannabinoids , the active components of marihuana , exert a variety of effects in humans . Many of these effects are mediated by binding to two types of cannabinoid receptor , P21554 and CB2 . Although P21554 is located mainly in the central nervous system , it may also be found in peripheral tissues . Here , we study the effect of cannabinoids in the production of nerve growth factor by the prostate tumor cell line PC-3 . We show that addition of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol to PC-3 cells stimulated nerve growth factor production in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner . Maximal effect was observed at 0.1 microM Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and 72 h of treatment . Stimulation was reversed by the P21554 antagonists AM 251 and SR 1411716A . Pre-treatment of cells with pertussis toxin also prevented the effect promoted by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol . These results indicate that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol stimulation of nerve growth factor production in these cells was mediated by the cannabinoid P21554 receptor . The implication of P04049 activation in the mode of action of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol is also suggested .
