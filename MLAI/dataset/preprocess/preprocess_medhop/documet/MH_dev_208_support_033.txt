DB04958 -SN-38 : a new antibody-drug conjugate for the therapy of hematologic malignancies . We previously found that slowly internalizing antibodies conjugated with SN-38 could be used successfully when prepared with a linker that allows approximately 50 % of the IgG-bound SN-38 to dissociate in serum every 24 hours . In this study , the efficacy of SN-38 conjugates prepared with epratuzumab ( rapidly internalizing ) and veltuzumab ( slowly internalizing ) , humanized anti- P20273 and anti- P11836 IgG , respectively , was examined for the treatment of B-cell malignancies . Both antibody-drug conjugates had similar nanomolar activity against a variety of human lymphoma/leukemia cell lines , but slow release of SN-38 compromised potency discrimination in vitro even against an irrelevant conjugate . When SN-38 was stably linked to the anti- P20273 conjugate , its potency was reduced 40- to 55-fold . Therefore , further studies were conducted only with the less stable , slowly dissociating linker . In vivo , similar antitumor activity was found between P20273 and P11836 antibody-drug conjugate in mice-bearing Ramos xenografts , even though Ramos expressed 15-fold more P11836 than P20273 , suggesting that the internalization of the epratuzumab-SN-38 conjugate ( Emab-SN-38 ) enhanced its activity . Emab-SN-38 was more efficacious than a nonbinding , irrelevant IgG-SN-38 conjugate in vivo , eliminating a majority of well-established Ramos xenografts at nontoxic doses . In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Emab-SN-38 could be combined with unconjugated veltuzumab for a more effective treatment . Thus , Emab-SN-38 is active in lymphoma and leukemia at doses well below toxic levels and therefore represents a new promising agent with therapeutic potential alone or combined with anti- P11836 antibody therapy .
