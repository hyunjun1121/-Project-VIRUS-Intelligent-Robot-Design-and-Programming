DB00087 in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . DB00087 is a humanized therapeutic monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) that recognizes the P31358 antigen , expressed on normal and neoplastic lymphocytes , monocytes , and natural killer cells . In 2001 , alemtuzumab was approved in the US and Europe to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) that had been treated previously with alkylating agents and was refractory to fludarabine . In heavily pretreated patients this MAb is able to produce response rates of about 40 % , and in symptomatic , previously untreated patients response rates of more than 80 % can be achieved . DB00087 can also be used in patients with CLL as a preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation ( P09683 ) and to prevent graft versus host disease . Moreover its in vivo use before or after P09683 may also potentially result in depletion of residual leukemia cells , especially in the autologous setting . Adverse events associated with alemtuzumab include acute first-dose reaction , hematologic toxicity , and infectious complications . Usually they are predictable , manageable , and acceptable in the context of CLL . However , in a significant percentage of patients , cytomegalovirus reactivation occurs during alemtuzumab therapy , and routine weekly monitoring with the polymerase chain reaction methodology is indicated . Moreover , antiviral and antibacterial prophylaxis is mandatory .
