3,3'-Diindolylmethane induces P55008 arrest and apoptosis in human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells . Certain bioactive food components , including indole-3-carbinol ( I3C ) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane ( DIM ) from cruciferous vegetables , have been shown to target cellular pathways regulating carcinogenesis . Previously , our laboratory showed that dietary I3C is an effective transplacental chemopreventive agent in a dibenzo[def,p]chrysene ( DBC ) -dependent model of murine T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma . The primary objective of the present study was to extend our chemoprevention studies in mice to an analogous human neoplasm in cell culture . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that I3C or DIM may be chemotherapeutic in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) cells . Treatment of the T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM , CCRF-HSB2 , P60880 -T1 and Jurkat with DIM in vitro significantly reduced cell proliferation and viability at concentrations 8- to 25-fold lower than the parent compound I3C . DIM ( 7.5 µM ) arrested CEM and HSB2 cells at the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and 15 µM DIM significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in all T-ALL lines . In CEM cells , DIM reduced protein expression of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 ( P11802 , Q00534 ) and D-type cyclin 3 ( P30281 ) ; DIM also significantly altered expression of eight transcripts related to human apoptosis ( Q9HD36 , P29965 , O00198 , P01375 , P19438 , Q93038 , P32971 , Q9BUZ4 ) . Similar anticancer effects of DIM were observed in vivo . Dietary exposure to 100 ppm DIM significantly decreased the rate of growth of human CEM xenografts in immunodeficient SCID mice , reduced final tumor size by 44 % and increased the apoptotic index compared to control-fed mice . Taken together , our results demonstrate a potential for therapeutic application of DIM in T-ALL .
