P10646 in activated prothrombin complex concentrates ( aPCC ) moderates the effectiveness of therapy in some severe hemophilia A patients with inhibitor . Some hemophilia A patients who have developed inhibitors are poorly responsive to activated prothrombin complex concentrates ( aPCC ) after daily dosage , but the mechanism(s) underlying this remain unknown . We examined two representative cases . In case 1 , we found that changing to recombinant factor VIIa ( DB00036 ) therapy was more effective , and the response to aPCC was restored within ~2 weeks . P13726 ( TF ) -triggered thrombin generation demonstrated a prolonged lag-time and decreased peak thrombin , and this impairment was focused on TF pathway inhibitor ( P10646 ) . Plasma-free P10646 was elevated post-infusion of aPCC , while this was unaffected by DB00036 . P10646 returned to normal range within 2-3 weeks . Plasmas obtained from patients with poor or good response to aPCC ( aPCC-poor or aPCC-good ) , and good response to DB00036 ( FVIIa-good ) demonstrated that free P10646 levels are increased in both aPCC groups , but not in FVIIa-good . P10646 levels pre- and post-infusion in aPCC-poor were significantly higher than those in aPCC-good . Addition of anti- P10646 antibody to the reaction samples demonstrated a greater increase of peak thrombin in aPCC-poor compared to aPCC-good , showing the higher P10646 activity in aPCC-poor . Free P10646 contained in aPCC corresponded to the increasing levels in plasma . In conclusion , P10646 in aPCC attenuated thrombin generation , and the reduced effectiveness of therapy in these circumstances appeared to be related to P10646 activity .
