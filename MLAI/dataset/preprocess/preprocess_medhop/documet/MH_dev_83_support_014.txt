Current application of selective P35354 inhibitors in cancer prevention and treatment . The multistep process of carcinogenesis , which can take many years , provides many opportunities for intervention to inhibit disease progression . Effective chemoprevention agents may reduce the risk of cancer by inhibiting the initiation stage of carcinoma through induction of apoptosis or DNA repair in cells harboring mutations , or they may act to prevent promotion of tumor growth . Similarly , chemoprevention may entail blocking cancer progression to an invasive phenotype . Over the past decade , in vitro , preclinical , and clinical data have supported the hypothesis that cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 plays a central role in oncogenesis and that treatment with P35354 inhibitors offers an effective chemoprevention strategy , as exemplified by the activity of celecoxib ( DB00482 ) in familial adenomatous polyposis . These P35354 data have contributed to initiation of clinical trials testing P35354 inhibitors for the chemoprevention of a wide variety of cancers that overexpress P35354 .
