The combined effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms , tobacco products , and ethanol on normal resting blood mononuclear cells . INTRODUCTION : Tobacco and ethanol consumption are crucial factors in the development of various diseases including cancer . In this investigation , we evaluated the combined effects of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , with ethanol and tobacco products on healthy individuals . METHODS : Pure nicotine , cigarette smoke extract , and Swedish snuff ( snus ) extract were used . The effects were examined by means of in vitro cell cycle progression and cell death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) obtained from healthy donors . RESULTS : After 3 days , in vitro , resting PBMCs entered the S and G2 stage in the presence of 100 ÂµM nicotine . The PBMCs only proceeded to S stage , in the presence of 0.2 % ethanol . The nicotine- and ethanol-induced normal cell cycle progression correlated to a number of SNPs in the Q99665 , Rad 52 , O43543 , P04637 , P30281 , and O95477 genes . Certain SNPs in Caspases 8 , Q99665 , Rad 52 , P08253 , and Q00987 genes appeared to significantly influence the effects of EtOH- , snus- , and snus + EtOH-induced cell death . Importantly , the highest degree of cell death was observed in the presence of smoke + EtOH . The amount of cell death under this treatment condition also correlated to specific SNPs , located in the Q00987 , O95477 , or Q9H3R0 genes . CONCLUSIONS : Cigarette smoke in combination with ethanol strongly induced massive cell death . Long-term exposure to smoke and ethanol could provoke chronic inflammation , and this could be the initiation of disease including the development of cancer at various sites .
