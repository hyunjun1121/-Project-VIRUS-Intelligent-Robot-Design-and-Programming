Novel quinolinylaminoisoquinoline bioisosteres of sorafenib as selective P04049 kinase inhibitors : design , synthesis , and antiproliferative activity against melanoma cell line . Design and synthesis of a new series of quinolinylaminoisoquinoline derivatives as conformationally restricted bioisosteres of DB00398 are described . Their in vitro antiproliferative activity against A375P melanoma cell line was tested . Compounds 1b , 1d , 1g , and 1j showed the highest potency against A375P cell line with IC50 values in sub-micromolar scale . In addition , compound 1d exerted high selectivity towards P04049 serine/threonine kinase with 96.47 % inhibition at 10 µM , and IC50 of 0.96 µM . This compound can possess antiproliferative activity against melanoma cells through inhibition of P04049 kinase .
