Glucagon-like peptide-1 stimulates luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone secretion in a rodent hypothalamic neuronal cell line . To examine the influence of the putative satiety factor ( P0C6A0 ) on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis , we used GT1-7 cells as a model of neuronal luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone ( P01148 ) release . P0C6A0 caused a concentration-dependent increase in P01148 release from GT1-7 cells . Specific , saturable P0C6A0 binding sites were demonstrated on these cells . The binding of [125I] P0C6A0 was time-dependent and consistent with a single binding site ( Kd = 0.07+/-0.016 nM ; binding capacity = 160+/-11 fmol/mg protein ) . The specific P43220 agonists , exendin-3 and exendin-4 , also showed high affinity ( Ki = 0.3+/-0.05 and 0.32+/-0.06 nM , respectively ) as did the antagonist exendin-(9-39) ( Ki = 0.98+/-0.24 nM ) . At concentrations that increased P01148 release , P0C6A0 ( 0.5-10 nM ) also caused an increase in intracellular DB02527 in GT1-7 cells ( 10 nM P0C6A0 : 7.66+/-0.4 vs. control : 0.23+/-0.02 nmol/mg protein ; P < 0.001 ) . Intracerebroventricular injection of P0C6A0 at a single concentration ( 10 microg ) produced a prompt increase in the plasma luteinizing hormone concentration in male rats ( P0C6A0 : 1.09+/-0.11 vs. saline : 0.69+/-0.06 ng/ml ; P < 0.005 ) . P0C6A0 levels in the hypothalami of 48-h-fasted male rats showed a decrease , indicating a possible association of the satiety factor with the low luteinizing hormone levels in animals with a negative energy balance .
