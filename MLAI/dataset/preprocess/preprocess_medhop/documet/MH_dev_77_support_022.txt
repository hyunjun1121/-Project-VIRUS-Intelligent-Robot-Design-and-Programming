Cdk5/p35 regulates neurotransmitter release through phosphorylation and downregulation of P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel activity . P12004 -dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase with close structural homology to the mitotic Cdks . The complex of Cdk5 and p35 , the neuron-specific regulatory subunit of Cdk5 , plays important roles in brain development , such as neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth . Moreover , Cdk5 is thought to be involved in the promotion of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer 's disease . Cdk5 is abundant in mature neurons ; however , its physiological functions in the adult brain are unknown . Here we show that Cdk5/p35 regulates neurotransmitter release in the presynaptic terminal . Both Cdk5 and p35 were abundant in the synaptosomes . Roscovitine , a specific inhibitor of Cdk5 in neurons , induced neurotransmitter release from the synaptosomes in response to membrane depolarization and enhanced the EPSP slopes in rat hippocampal slices . The electrophysiological study using each specific inhibitor of the voltage-dependent calcium channels ( VDCCs ) and calcium imaging revealed that roscovitine enhanced Ca2+ influx from the P/Q-type VDCC . Moreover , Cdk5/p25 phosphorylated the intracellular loop connecting domains II and III ( L(II-III) ) between amino acid residues 724 and 981 of isoforms cloned from rat brain of the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels . The phosphorylation inhibited the interaction of L(II-III) with P60880 and synaptotagmin I , which were plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein ( P60880 ) receptor ( SNARE ) proteins and were required for efficient neurotransmitter release . These results strongly suggest that Cdk5/p35 inhibits neurotransmitter release through the phosphorylation of P/Q-type VDCC and downregulation of the channel activity .
