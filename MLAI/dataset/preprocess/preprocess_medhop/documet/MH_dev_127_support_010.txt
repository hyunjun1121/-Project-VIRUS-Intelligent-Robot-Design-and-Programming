The ' allosteric modulator ' P35240 -202676 disrupts G protein-coupled receptor function via sulphydryl-sensitive mechanisms . 1. Previous studies suggest that the thiadiazole compound P35240 -202676 ( N-(2,3-diphenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-(2H)-ylidene)methanamine ) acts as an allosteric modulator of a variety of structurally distinct G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . It was postulated that P35240 -202676 would directly bind a structural motif in the receptor molecule common to divergent members of the GPCR family . The molecular mechanisms of such a promiscuous action , however , remain obscure . 2 . To clarify the mechanism of P35240 -202676 action , we used the functional approach of [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography with rat brain cryostat sections together with classical membrane [35S]GTPgammaS binding assays to evaluate how the thiadiazole affects G protein activity mediated by various receptors linked to the Gi-family of G proteins . 3 . We found that in the absence of dithiotreitol ( DTT ) , P35240 -202676 ( 10(-7)-10(-5) M ) elicits nonspecific effects in the [35S]GTPgammaS-based G protein activation assays , thereby severely compromising interpretations on the compounds ability to allosterically inhibit receptor-mediated G protein activity . Such a nonspecific behaviour was fully reversed upon addition of DTT ( 1 mM ) , revealing thiol-based mechanism of action . 4 . In routine incubations containing DTT , P35240 -202676 had no effect on receptor-driven G protein activity , as assessed for adenosine A1 , alpha2-adrenergic , cannabinoid P21554 , lysophosphatidic acid Q92633 , muscarinic M2/M4 , purinergic Q9H244 or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors , suggesting that the thiadiazole does not act as an allosteric modulator of GPCR function . 5 . 1H NMR analysis indicated that P35240 -202676 underwent structural changes after incubation with the reducing agent DTT or with brain tissue . 6 . We conclude that P35240 -202676 modulates GPCRs via thiol modification rather than via true allosteric mechanisms .
