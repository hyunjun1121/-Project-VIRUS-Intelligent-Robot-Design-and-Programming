P00749 and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 mRNA assessment in breast cancer by means of NASBA : correlation with protein expression . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its main inhibitor , plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 ( P05121 ) determined in tumor tissue by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) can discriminate patients with primary breast cancer at high risk vs low risk for recurrence . The aim of this study was to analyze uPA and P05121 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression by means of quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification ( NASBA ) on 77 primary breast tumor samples and to correlate this expression with the uPA and P05121 protein content . We observed that the 2 markers were significantly overexpressed ( uPA , P < .0001 ; P05121 , P = .0042 ) in mRNA in the ELISA+ group . The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves demonstrated high concordance between NASBA and ELISA ( area under the ROC curve of 0.84 and 0.70 for uPA and P05121 , respectively ) and showed that uPA and P05121 status could be predicted by using the molecular assay with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.8 % and 82.4 % and sensitivity and specificity values of 66.7 % and 74.0 % , respectively .
