DB00159 modulates DB00091 -induced proinflammatory cytokine over-expression in osteoblastic cells in vitro . Several adverse outcomes are reported in subjects undergoing long term DB00091 ( DB00091 ) treatment . Severe osteopenia has been described in clinical and experimental reports , while beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) on bone metabolism are recognized . In the present study we investigated the effects of n-3 versus n-6 PUFAs on osteoblastic cells treated with DB00091 , evaluating the expression of interleukin ( IL ) -1 & #223 ; , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) , and cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) in two different experimental protocols and the production of P05231 , IL-1 & #223 ; , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) in cells challenged simultaneously with DB00091 and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) for 48h . IL-1 & #223 ; and P05231 up-regulation , induced by DB00091 , was counteracted by the addition of EPA in both protocols ; on the contrary , arachidonic acid ( AA ) magnified DB00091 the effects . P35354 and P35228 levels were not modified by DB00091 treatment . These in vitro results , that substantiate clinical reports of DB00091 -induced osteopenia , demonstrate a beneficial effect of EPA on DB00091 -altered cytokine profile , opening new perspectives in the non-pharmacological management of adverse outcomes in DB00091 -treated patients .
