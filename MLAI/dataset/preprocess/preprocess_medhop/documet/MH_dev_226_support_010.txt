DB02709 , a polyphenol found in grapes , suppresses oxidative damage and stimulates apoptosis during early colonic inflammation in rats . Oxidative stress , neutrophil infiltration , proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoid generation are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal bowel disease . DB02709 , a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine , has been shown to have anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , antitumour and immunomodulatory activities , however , its effects on experimental colitis remain unknown . We have investigated the effects of resveratrol on the colon injury caused by intracolonic instillation of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid ( TNBS ) in rats . We determined the production of prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and P52209 (2) in colon mucosa and the expression of cyclo-oxygenases ( P36551 ) -1 and -2 immunohistochemically . The inflammatory response was assessed by histology and myeloperoxidase activity , as an index of neutrophil infiltration . P01584 production , histological and histochemical analysis of the lesions were also carried out . Finally , since resveratrol has been found to modulate apoptosis we intended to elucidate its effects on colonic mucosa under early acute inflammatory conditions . DB02709 ( 5-10mg/kg/day ) significantly reduced the degree of colonic injury , the index of neutrophil infiltration and the levels of the cytokine . DB02709 did not revert the increased PGE(2) levels but produced a significant fall in the P52209 (2) concentration . Compared with inflamed colon , no changes in staining for P23219 were observed in colon of resveratrol and TNBS-treated rats . In contrast , P35354 expression was decreased . Furthermore , resveratrol enhanced apoptosis compared with already high level induced by TNBS . In conclusion , resveratrol reduces the damage in experimentally induced colitis , alleviates the oxidative events and stimulates apoptosis .
