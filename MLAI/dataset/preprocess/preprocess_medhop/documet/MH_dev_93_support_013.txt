Estrogen regulation of uterine genes in vivo detected by complementary DNA array . INTRODUCTION : In the present study , our aim was to identify differentially expressed genes involved in estrogen actions at the endometrium level in rats . METHODS : Thirty adult rats were ovariectomized four days prior to drug administration for 48 days . Rats were divided in 2 groups : I , control and II , conjugated equine estrogens ( CCE ) . Total RNA was isolated from uterus , and differential expression was analyzed by array technology and RT-PCR . RESULTS : A total of 32 candidate genes were shown to be upregulated or downregulated in groups I or II . Among them , differential expression was already confirmed by RT-PCR for P24593 , P28222 , c-kit , and P15692 , genes whose expression was up regulated during CCE therapy , and casein kinase II and serine kinase expression was the same level in both groups . CONCLUSION : We have demonstrated that cDNA array represents a powerful approach to identify key molecules in the estrogens therapy . A number of the candidates reported here should provide new markers that may contribute to the detection of target estrogen receptor . This information may also aid the development of new approaches to therapeutic intervention .
