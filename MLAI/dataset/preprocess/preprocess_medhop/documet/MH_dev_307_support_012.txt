A microRNA signature for a P12643 -induced osteoblast lineage commitment program . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are potent morphogens that activate transcriptional programs for lineage determination . How BMP induction of a phenotype is coordinated with microRNAs ( miRNAs ) that inhibit biological pathways to control cell differentiation , remains unknown . Here , we show by profiling miRNAs during P12643 induced osteogenesis of C2C12 mesenchymal cells , that 22 of 25 miRNAs which significantly changed in response to P12643 are down-regulated . These miRNAs are each predicted to target components of multiple osteogenic pathways . We characterize two representative miRNAs and show that miR-133 directly targets Runx2 , an early BMP response gene essential for bone formation , and miR-135 targets Q99717 , a key transducer of the P12643 osteogenic signal , controlled through their 3'UTR sequences . Both miRNAs functionally inhibit differentiation of osteoprogenitors by attenuating Runx2 and Q99717 pathways that synergistically contribute to bone formation . Although miR-133 is known to promote Q9P2K5 -dependent myogenesis , we have identified a second complementary function to inhibit Runx2-mediated osteogenesis . Our key finding is that P12643 controls bone cell determination by inducing miRNAs that target muscle genes but mainly by down-regulating multiple miRNAs that constitute an osteogenic program , thereby releasing from inhibition pathway components required for cell lineage commitment . Thus , our studies establish a mechanism for BMP morphogens to selectively induce a tissue-specific phenotype and suppress alternative lineages .
