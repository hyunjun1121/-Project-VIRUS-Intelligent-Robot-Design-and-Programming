Activation of the p38 MAPK/Akt/ P27361 /2 signal pathways is required for the protein stabilization of Q99741 and cyclin D1 in low-dose arsenite-induced cell proliferation . DB01169 ( ATO ) is a first-line anti-cancer agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia , and induces apoptosis in other solid cancer cell lines including breast cancer cells . However , as with arsenites found in drinking water and used as raw materials for wood preservatives , insecticides , and herbicides , low doses of ATO can induce carcinogenesis after long-term exposure . At 24 h after exposure , ATO ( 0.01-1 ÂµM ) significantly increased cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle progression from the P55008 to S/G2 phases in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cell line . The expression of 14 out of 96 cell-cycle-associated genes significantly increased , and seven of these genes including cell division cycle 6 ( Q99741 ) and cyclin D1 ( P24385 ) were closely related to cell cycle progression from P55008 to S phase . Low-dose ATO steadily increased gene transcript and protein levels of both Q99741 and cyclin D1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Low-dose ATO produced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and activated the p38 MAPK , Akt , and P27361 /2 pathways at different time points within 60 min . Small molecular inhibitors and siRNAs inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK , Akt , and P27361 /2 decreased the ATO-increased expression of Q99741 protein . Inhibiting the activation of Akt and P27361 /2 , but not p38 MAPK , decreased the ATO-induced expression of cyclin D1 protein . This study reports for the first time that p38 MAPK/Akt/ P27361 /2 activation is required for the protein stabilization of Q99741 in addition to cyclin D1 in ATO-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle modulation from P55008 to S phase .
