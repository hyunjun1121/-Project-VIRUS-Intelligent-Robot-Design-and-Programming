Critical role of both p27KIP1 and p21CIP1/ P38936 in the antiproliferative effect of ZD1839 ( ' DB00317 ' ) , an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , in head and neck squamous carcinoma cells . High expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) has been implicated in the development of squamous-cell carcinomas of head and neck ( SCCHN ) . ZD1839 ( ' DB00317 ' ) is an orally active , selective P00533 -TKI ( P00533 -tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in proliferation and survival of cancer cells , and other host-dependent processes promoting cancer growth . We have demonstrated that ZD1839 induces growth arrest in SCCHN cell lines by inhibiting P00533 -mediated signaling . Cell cycle kinetic analysis demonstrated that ZD1839 induces a delay in cell cycle progression and a P55008 arrest together with a partial G2/M block ; this was associated with increased expression of both p27( P46527 ) and P38936 (CIP1/ P38936 ) cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors . The activity of P24941 , the main target of CIP/ Q99828 CDK inhibitors , was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion after 24 h of ZD1839 treatment and this effect correlated to the increased amount of p27( P46527 ) and P38936 (CIP1/ P38936 ) proteins associated with P24941 -cyclin-E and P24941 -cyclin-A complexes . In addition , ZD1839-induced growth inhibition was significantly reduced in cell transfectants expressing p27( P46527 ) or P38936 (CIP1/ P38936 ) antisense constructs . Overall , these results as well as the timing of the effect of ZD1839 on P55008 arrest and p27( P46527 ) and P38936 (CIP1/ P38936 ) upregulation , suggest a mechanistic connection between these events .
