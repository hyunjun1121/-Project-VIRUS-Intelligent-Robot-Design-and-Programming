DB04216 protects mouse brain against lead-induced neurotoxicity . DB04216 ( QE ) , the major bioflavonoid in the human diet , has been reported to have many benefits and medicinal properties . However , its protective effects against lead ( Pb ) -induced neurotoxicity have not been clarified . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of QE on neurotoxicity in mice exposed to Pb . Mice were exposed to lead acetate ( 20 mg/kg body weight/day ) intragastrically with or without QE ( 15 and 30 mg/kg body weight/day ) coadministration for 3 months . The data showed that QE significantly prevented Pb-induced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner . Exploration of the underlying mechanisms of QE action revealed that QE administration decreased Pb contents in blood ( 13.2 , 19.1 % ) and brain ( 17.1 , 20.0 % ) . QE markedly increased NO production ( Q04695 , 61.1 % ) and PKA activity ( 51.0 , 57.8 % ) in brains of Pb-treated mice . Additionally , QE remarkably suppressed Pb-induced oxidative stress in mouse brain . Western blot analysis showed that QE increased the phosphorylations of Akt , CaMKII P29475 , P29474 , and CREB in brains of Pb-treated mice . The results suggest that QE can inhibit Pb-induced neurotoxicity and partly restore PKA , Akt , NOS , CaMKII , and CREB activities .
