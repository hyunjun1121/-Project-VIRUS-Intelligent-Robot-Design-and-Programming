Increased exchange rate of histone H1 on chromatin by exogenous myogenin expression . To explore the molecular mechanism of chromatin remodeling involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation of specific genes by a myogenic regulatory factor P15173 , we used NIH3T3 fibroblasts with a stably integrated H1.1-GFP fusion protein to monitor histone H1 movement directly by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( P42345 ) in living cells . The observation from P42345 experiments with myogenin transfected fibroblasts showed that the exchange rate of histone H1 in chromatin was obviously increased , indicating that forced expression of exogenous P15173 can induce chromatin remodeling . The hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 from myogenin transfected fibroblasts was detected by triton-acid-urea ( P10636 ) /SDS ( 2-D ) electrophoresis and Western blot with specific antibodies against acetylated N-termini of histones H3 and H4 . RT-PCR analysis indicated that the nAChR alpha-subunit gene was expressed in the transfected fibroblasts . These results suggest that the expression of exogenous P15173 can induce chromatin remodeling and activate the transcription of P15173 -targeted gene in non-muscle cells .
