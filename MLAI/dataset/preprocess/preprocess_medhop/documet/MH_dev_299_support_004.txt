Blockage of the neurokinin 1 receptor and capsaicin-induced ablation of the enteric afferent nerves protect SCID mice against T-cell-induced chronic colitis . BACKGROUND : The neurotransmitter DB05875 ( SP ) released by , and the transient receptor potential vanilloid ( Q8NER1 ) , expressed by afferent nerves , have been implicated in mucosal neuro-immune-regulation . To test if enteric afferent nerves are of importance for the development of chronic colitis , we examined antagonists for the high-affinity neurokinin 1 ( NK-1 ) SP receptor and the Q8NER1 receptor agonist capsaicin in a T-cell transfer model for chronic colitis . METHODS : Chronic colitis was induced in SCID mice by injection of P01730 (+)CD25(-) T cells . The importance of NK-1 signaling and Q8NER1 expressing afferent nerves for disease development was studied in recipient SCID mice systemically treated with either high-affinity P25103 antagonists or neurotoxic doses of capsaicin . In addition , we studied the colitis-inducing effect of P25103 deleted P01730 (+)CD25(-) T cells . RESULTS : Treatment with the P25103 antagonist P62158 4092 reduced the severity of colitis , but colitis was induced by P25103 -deleted T cells , suggesting that SP in colitis targets the recipient mouse cells and not the colitogenic donor T cells . DB06774 -induced depletion of nociceptive afferent nerves prior to P01730 (+)CD25(-) T-cell transfer completely inhibited the development of colitis . CONCLUSIONS : Our data demonstrate the importance of an intact enteric afferent nerve system and NK-1 signaling in mucosal inflammation and may suggest new treatment modalities for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease .
