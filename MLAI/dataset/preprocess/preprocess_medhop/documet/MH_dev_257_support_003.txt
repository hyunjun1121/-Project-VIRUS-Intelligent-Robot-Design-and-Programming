DB01233 does not increase gastric muscle contractility in newborn rats . Feeding intolerance resulting from delayed gastric emptying is common in premature neonates . DB01233 ( MCP ) , the most frequently used prokinetic drug in neonates , enhances gastric muscle contractility through inhibition of dopamine receptors . Although its therapeutic benefit is established in adults , limited data are available to support its clinical use in infants . Hypothesizing that developmentally dependent differences are present , we comparatively evaluated the effect of MCP on fundus muscle contractility in newborn , juvenile , and adult rats . The muscle strips were either contracted with electrical field stimulation ( O43281 ) to induce cholinergic nerve-mediated acetylcholine release or carbachol , a cholinergic agonist acting directly on the muscarinic receptor . Although in adult rats MCP increased O43281 -induced contraction by 294 ± 122 % of control ( P < 0.01 ) , no significant effect was observed in newborn fundic muscle . MCP had no effect on the magnitude of the carbachol-induced and/or bethanechol-induced gastric muscle contraction at any age . In response to dopamine , an 80.7 ± 5.3 % relaxation of adult fundic muscle was observed , compared with only a 8.4 ± 8.7 % response in newborn tissue ( P < 0.01 ) . P14416 expression was scant in neonates and significantly increased in adult gastric tissue ( P < 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the lack of MCP effect on the newborn fundic muscle contraction potential relates to developmental differences in dopamine D2 receptor expression . To the extent that these novel data can be extrapolated to neonates , the therapeutic value of MCP as a prokinetic agent early in life requires further evaluation .
