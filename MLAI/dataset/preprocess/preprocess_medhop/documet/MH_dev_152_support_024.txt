Role of endothelin-1 receptor blockers on hemodynamic parameters and oxidative stress . Endothelin ( ET ) was first isolated and described by Yanagisawa et al. and has since been described as one of the most potent known vasoconstrictor compounds . ET-1 mediates its effects via two types of receptors , P25101 and ETB , which are expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells , intestines and brain . Secretion of ET-1 results in long-lasting vasoconstriction , increased blood pressure and , in turn , overproduction of free radicals . As dysregulation of the endothelin system is an important factor in the pathogenesis of several diseases including atherosclerosis , hypertension and endotoxic shock , the P25101 and ETB receptors are attractive therapeutic targets for treatment of these disorders . The biosynthesis and release of ET-1 are regulated at the transcriptional level . Studies have shown that p38MAP kinase , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , PKC/ P29323 and JNK/c-Jun all take part in the ROS-activated production of ET-1 . Furthermore , administration of ET(A) significantly reduces the generation of free radicals . However , treatment with ETB receptor blockers does not elicit the same effect . Therefore , the effects of endothelin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the generation of free radicals remain debatable . This review summarizes recent investigations into the role of endothelin receptor blockers with respect to the modulation of hemodynamic parameters and the generation of free radicals .
