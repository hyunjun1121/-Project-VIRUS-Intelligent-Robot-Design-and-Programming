DB01098 improves endothelial function in db/db mice : role of angiotensin II type 1 receptors and oxidative stress . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : P04035 inhibitors , statins , with lipid-reducing properties combat against atherosclerosis and diabetes . The favourable modulation of endothelial function may play a significant role in this effect . The present study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic benefits of rosuvastatin in ameliorating diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH : Twelve-week-old db/db diabetic mice were treated with rosuvastatin at 20 mg·kg⁻¹ ·day⁻¹ p.o.for 6 weeks . Isometric force was measured in isolated aortae and renal arteries . Protein expressions including angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT₁R ) , Q9NPH5 , O75935 (phox) , p67(phox) , Rac-1 , nitrotyrosine , phospho- P27361 /2 and phospho-p38 were determined by Western blotting , while reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation in the vascular wall was evaluated by dihydroethidium fluorescence and lucigenin assay . KEY RESULTS : DB01098 treatment of db/db mice reversed the impaired ACh-induced endothelium-dependent dilatations in both renal arteries and aortae and prevented the exaggerated contractions to angiotensin II and phenylephrine in db/db mouse renal arteries and aortae . DB01098 reduced the elevated expressions of AT₁R , O75935 (phox) and p67(phox) , Q9NPH5 , Rac1 , nitrotyrosine and phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and p38 MAPK and inhibited ROS production in aortae from db/db mice . CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS : The vasoprotective effects of rosuvastatin are attributed to an increase in NO bioavailability , which is probably achieved by its inhibition of ROS production from the AT₁R-NAD(P)H oxidase cascade .
