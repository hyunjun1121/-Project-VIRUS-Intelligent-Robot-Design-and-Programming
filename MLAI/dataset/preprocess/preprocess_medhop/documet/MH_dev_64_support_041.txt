Dual kinase inhibition of P00533 and P04626 overcomes resistance to cetuximab in a novel in vivo model of acquired cetuximab resistance . PURPOSE : Acquired resistance to cetuximab , a chimeric epidermal growth factor receptor ( P00533 ) -targeting monoclonal antibody , is a widespread problem in the treatment of solid tumors . The paucity of preclinical models has limited investigations to determine the mechanism of acquired therapeutic resistance , thereby limiting the development of effective treatments . The purpose of this study was to generate cetuximab-resistant tumors in vivo to characterize mechanisms of acquired resistance . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We generated cetuximab-resistant clones from a cetuximab-sensitive bladder cancer cell line in vivo by exposing cetuximab-sensitive xenografts to increasing concentrations of cetuximab , followed by validation of the resistant phenotype in vivo and in vitro using invasion assays . A candidate-based approach was used to examine the role of P04626 on mediating cetuximab resistance both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS : We generated a novel model of cetuximab resistance , and , for the first time in the context of P00533 -inhibitor resistance , we identified increased phosphorylation of a C-terminal fragment of P04626 ( 611-CTF ) in cetuximab-resistant cells . DB08916 ( BIBW-2992 ) , an irreversible kinase inhibitor targeting P00533 and P04626 , successfully inhibited growth of the cetuximab-resistant cells in vitro . When afatinib was combined with cetuximab in vivo , we observed an additive growth inhibitory effect in cetuximab-resistant xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : These data suggest that the use of dual P00533 - P04626 kinase inhibitors can enhance responses to cetuximab , perhaps in part due to downregulation of 611-CTF . This study conducted in a novel in vivo model provides a mechanistic rationale for ongoing phase I clinical trials using this combination treatment modality .
