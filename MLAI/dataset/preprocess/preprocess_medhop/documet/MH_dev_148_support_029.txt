Statin Modulation of Human T-Cell Proliferation , IL-1β and Q16552 Production , and IFN-γ T Cell Expression : Synergy with Conventional Immunosuppressive Agents . P04035 inhibitors ( statins ) have been demonstrated to be immunomodulatory for human immune-mediated disease and in experimental models . The aim of this study was to compare statin-mediated immunosuppressive effects on human T-cell responses in vitro with those of conventional immunosuppressives ( dexamethasone , cyclosporin A ( DB00091 ) , mycophenolate , and rapamycin ) . Statins ( atorvastatin , lovastatin , and simvastatin ) were investigated for their modulatory effects on human PBMC viability , cytokine profiles , and T-cell proliferation . At concentrations that inhibited anti-CD3/28-stimulated T-cell proliferation ( P < 0.01 ) , simvastatin significantly decreased intracellular P01730 (+) T-cell expression of IFN-γ ( P < 0.01 ) to levels similar to those induced by conventional immunosuppressives . DB01076 and lovastatin also decreased IFN-γ expression , although to a lesser degree ( P < 0.05 ) . All three statins reduced levels of Q16552 production ( P < 0.01 ) . However , in response to anti-CD3/28 stimulation , simvastatin significantly upregulated IL-1β production ( P < 0.05 ) . The profile of cytokines produced in response to anti-CD3/28 stimulation was similar when both atorvastatin and dexamethasone were added as compared with dexamethasone alone , suggesting that atorvastatin can synergise with dexamethasone with respect to immunomodulation of cytokines . This data supports the hypothesis of selective statin-mediated immunomodulatory effects on human immune cells .
