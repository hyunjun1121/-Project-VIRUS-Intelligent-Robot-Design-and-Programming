The Q7Z2W7 ion channel comprises direct Gq protein-activating capacity . The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family of ion channels comprises receptors that are activated by a vast variety of physical as well as chemical stimuli . TRP channels interact in a complex manner with several intracellular signaling cascades , both up- and downstream of receptor activation . Investigating cascades stimulated downstream of the cold and menthol receptor Q7Z2W7 , we found evidence for both , functional and structural interaction of Q7Z2W7 with Gαq . We demonstrated menthol-evoked increase in intracellular Ca(2+) under extracellular Ca(2+)-free conditions , which was blocked by the P98160 inhibitors U73122 or edelfosine . This metabotropic Ca(2+) signal could be observed also in cells expressing a channel-dead ( i.e. non-conducting ) or a chloride-conducting Q7Z2W7 pore mutant . However , this intracellular metabotropic Ca(2+) signal could not be detected in Gαq deficient cells or in the presence of dominant-negative GαqX . Evidence for a close spatial proximity necessary for physical interaction of Q7Z2W7 and Gαq was provided by acceptor bleaching experiments demonstrating FRET between Q7Z2W7 - P27918 and Gαq-YFP . A Gαq-YFP mobility assay ( P42345 ) revealed a restricted diffusion of Gαq-YFP under conditions when Q7Z2W7 is immobilized in the plasma membrane . Moreover , a menthol-induced and Q7Z2W7 -mediated G protein activation could be demonstrated by FRET experiments monitoring the dissociation of Gαq-YFP from a Gβ/Gγ- P27918 complex , and by the exchange of radioactive [(35)S]GTPγS for GDP . Our observations lead to a view that extends the operational range of the Q7Z2W7 receptor from its function as a pure ion channel to a molecular switch with additional metabotropic capacity .
