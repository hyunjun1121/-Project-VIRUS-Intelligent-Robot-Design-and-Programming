Role of the androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer . P10275 ( AR ) is expressed in nearly all prostate cancers , including treatment-refractory disease . The role of this receptor in the molecular endocrinology of prostate cancer has become increasingly clear in recent years . The AR is now known to participate in tumor progression through 3 mechanisms : expression ( activation and upregulation of receptor activity ) , point mutations , and ligand-independent activation . With regard to the latter mechanism , interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) is among the most important nonsteroidal regulators of AR activity . In the absence of androgen , P05231 causes activation of AR that is approximately 50 % of the maximal activity induced by androgen . At low concentrations of androgen , P05231 and androgen synergistically activate AR . Nonsteroidal antiandrogens usually antagonize this activation , but they switch to an agonist effect in the presence of oncostatin M , an P05231 -related cytokine . The growth of parental LNCaP cells is initially inhibited by exposure to P05231 , but long-term treatment renders the cells resistant to such inhibition and confers a growth advantage . Both P05231 and oncostatin M stimulate AR activity , but only oncostatin M is associated with strong acquisition of the agonist properties of nonsteroidal antiandrogens . It is hoped that continuing research on AR expression and function in prostate cancer will pave the way for new therapeutic strategies .
