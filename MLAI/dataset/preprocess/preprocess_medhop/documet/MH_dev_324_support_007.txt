Interleukin 23 regulates proliferation of lung cancer cells in a concentration-dependent way in association with the interleukin-23 receptor . A proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin 23 ( IL-23 ) , plays a role in tumor progression by inducing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment , although there is debate about its role in carcinogenesis . Direct effects of IL-23 on tumor cells have been reported rarely , and contradictory effects have been observed . Here , we studied such effects of IL-23 in lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and explored the underlying mechanism . We found Q5VWK5 expression in tissues from lung adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissue . Interestingly , different concentrations of IL-23 had opposite effects in the same types of cells . We confirmed that the different effects could be explained by differences in binding to the Q5VWK5 ( subunits IL-23r and IL-12Rβ1 ) . Low concentrations of IL-23 promoted the proliferation of Q5VWK5 -positive A549 and P08709 -1 lung cancer cells by binding to IL-23r , whereas high concentrations of IL-23 inhibited proliferation of these cells by binding to both IL-23r and IL-12Rβ1 . In contrast , IL-23 had no effect on Q5VWK5 -negative SK-MES-1 cells . IL-23 regulated the growth of human lung cancer cells through its effects on P40763 expression and phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent way ; the Ki-67 gene was involved in these processes . Our findings demonstrate for the first time that IL-23 affects the proliferation of Q5VWK5 -positive lung cancer cells and that this effect is dependent on the IL-23 concentration . This can explain at least part of the inconsistent reports on the role of IL-23 in the progression of carcinogenesis .
