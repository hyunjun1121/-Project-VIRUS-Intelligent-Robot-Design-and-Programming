PPARγ and RXR ligands disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk in the hypoxic breast cancer stem cells niche . Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are affected by the local micro-environment , the niche , in which inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia act as steering factors . Here , two nuclear receptors ( NRs ) agonists , i.e. pioglitazone ( PGZ ) , a ligand of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ , and 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenanthrene ( IIF ) , a ligand of retinoid X receptors , were investigated for their capability to interference with the cross-talk between breast CSCs and the niche compartment . We found that IIF potentiates the ability of PGZ to hamper the mammospheres-forming capability of human breast tumours and MCF7 cancer cells , reducing the expression of CSCs regulatory genes ( Notch3 , P78504 , O43623 , P05231 , P02649 , Hypoxia inducible factor-1α and Q16790 ) . Notably , these effects are not observed in normal-MS obtained from human breast tissue . Importantly , NRs agonists abolish the capability of hypoxic MCF7 derived exosomes to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in mammary glands fibroblasts . Moreover , NRs agonist also directly acts on breast tumour associated fibroblasts to downregulate nuclear factor-κB pathway and metalloproteinases ( P08253 and P14780 ) expression and activity . In conclusion , NRs agonists disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk of the hypoxic breast CSCs niche .
