DB00563 selectable retroviral vectors for Gaucher disease . To develop a gene therapy protocol suitable for the treatment of a benign disease such as Gaucher disease , we have developed two bicistronic vectors that allow transduced cells to be selected for with methotrexate ( MTX ) . The two vectors differ in the presence or absence of a mutant polyoma enhancer ( delta Mo + PyF101 ) replacing the wild-type retroviral enhancer in the LTR . Infection of human TF-1 and K562 cells , Gaucher type II fibroblasts and murine hemopoietic bone marrow cells conferred MTX resistance and glucocerebrosidase ( GC ) expression . Upon increasing MTX concentrations , the number of proviral copies and GC activity increased , demonstrating in vitro selection of retrovirus-transduced cells . At high MTX selection pressure , up to 140 microM for infected Gaucher type II fibroblasts , no endogenous wild-type P00374 amplification could be detected , indicating that both retroviral constructs provide sufficient P00374 protein levels . Upon transduction , murine bone marrow cells were protected against otherwise lethal MTX concentrations ( range 1-5 microM MTX ) . Flow cytometry specific for human GC ( hGC ) demonstrated that in vitro selection resulted in increased percentages of hGC-positive murine cells . In conclusion , the generated bicistronic vectors are ideally suited to investigate whether an in vivo selection approach for retrovirus-transduced cells is feasible . Such a strategy might abolish the need for a high initial transduction efficiency and might result in a gene therapy protocol devoid of the undesirable need for marrow ablative treatment of the recipient .
