Electrophysiological examination of the effects of sustained flibanserin administration on serotonin receptors in rat brain . P08908 receptor agonists have proven to be effective antidepressant medications , however they suffer from a significant therapeutic lag before depressive symptoms abate . DB04908 is a P08908 receptor agonist and 5- Q13049 receptor antagonist developed to possibly induce a more rapid onset of antidepressant action through its preferential postsynaptic P08908 receptor agonism . DB04908 antagonized the effect of microiontophoretically-applied DOI in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) following 2 days of administration , indicating antagonism of postsynaptic 5- Q13049 receptors . This reduction in the effect of locally-applied DOI was no longer present following 7-day flibanserin administration . Two-day flibanserin administration only marginally reduced the firing activity of dorsal raphe ( DRN ) 5-HT neurons . Following 7 days of administration , 5-HT neuronal firing activity had returned to normal and the somatodendritic P08908 autoreceptors were desensitized . The responsiveness of postsynaptic P08908 receptors located on P07451 hippocampus pyramidal neurons and mPFC neurons , examined using microiontophoretically-applied 5-HT and gepirone , was unchanged following a 7-day flibanserin treatment . As demonstrated by the ability of the P08908 receptor antagonist WAY 100635 to selectively increase the firing of hippocampal neurons in 2- and 7-day treated rats , flibanserin enhanced the tonic activation of postsynaptic P08908 receptors in this brain region . The results suggest that flibanserin could be a therapeutically useful compound putatively endowed with a more rapid onset of antidepressant action .
