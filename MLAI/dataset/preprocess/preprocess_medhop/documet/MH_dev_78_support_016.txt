Possible mechanisms of drug-induced aspirin and clopidogrel resistance . DB00945 ( ASA ) and clopidogrel have been identified as standard of care in the prevention of major cardiovascular events . DB00945 irreversibly inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 ( P23219 ) enzyme , whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) reversibly inhibit the P23219 enzyme . An analysis of the literature revealed a statistically significant decrease in clinical benefit of ASA with concomitant administration of ibuprofen . Another NSAID , diclofenac , showed minimal effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation when administered with ASA . Furthermore , the selective P35354 inhibitor , rofecoxib , was not shown to influence the effect of ASA . DB00758 is metabolized to an active thiol metabolite by the CYP 3A4 enzyme . Some HMG DB01992 reductase inhibitors have the ability to inhibit the CYP 3A4 enzyme , which can result in a possible interaction if administered concomitantly with clopidogrel . Studies have demonstrated clopidogrel 's platelet inhibition being significantly attenuated by atorvastatin . However in a post-hoc analysis , it was demonstrated that there was no difference in clinical outcomes between patients taking clopidogrel and P04035 inhibitors metabolized by and not metabolized by CYP 3A4 . Data suggest that the interaction observed involving clopidogrel and P04035 inhibitors appears to be significant in-vitro . Therefore , practitioners should advise patients receiving chronic aspirin therapy to limit the use of ibuprofen and may consider concomitant administration of clopidogrel with P04035 inhibitors without regard for the drug interaction . The intent of this paper is to review the literature discussing possible mechanisms of drug-induced aspirin and clopidogrel resistance and discuss whether the interactions translate into clinical effects .
