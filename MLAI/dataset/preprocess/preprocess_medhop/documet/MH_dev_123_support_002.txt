Current treatment strategies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is recognized as the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide . NAFLD is a clinicopathologic syndrome ranging from simple steatosis , which is relatively benign , to the more severe form known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , which may progress to cirrhosis , liver failure , and hepatocellular carcinoma . NAFLD is associated with significant liver related morbidity and mortality , and its underlying pathophysiology is thought to result from a multiple hit process . The initial insult is the accumulation of hepatic fat secondary to insulin resistance . In the setting of hepatic steatosis , the second hit can be caused by reactive oxygen species , inflammatory cytokines , and adipokines . Several therapeutic modalities that target these mechanisms are under investigation , but no proven treatment has yet emerged . P01308 sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones and metformin show promise , and several studies have explored the role of lipid lowering agents , antioxidants , and cytoprotective agents . Novel agents such as anti-obesity drugs , selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blockers , and dual Q07869 alpha and gamma agonists are also under investigation . Unfortunately , data on the long-term safety and efficacy of these agents and their impact on liver related histologic outcomes are currently lacking . NAFLD treatment currently focuses on reducing metabolic risk factors , with the mainstay of therapy focusing on life-style modifications such as gradual weight loss through diet and regular exercise .
