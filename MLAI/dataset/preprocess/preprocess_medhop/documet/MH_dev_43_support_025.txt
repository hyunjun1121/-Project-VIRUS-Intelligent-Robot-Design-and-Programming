Opposing actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( P40763 ) in regulating microtubule stabilization during cardiac hypertrophy . Excessive proliferation and stabilization of the microtubule ( MT ) array in cardiac myocytes can accompany pathological cardiac hypertrophy , but the molecular control of these changes remains poorly characterized . In this study , we examined MT stabilization in two independent murine models of heart failure and revealed increases in the levels of post-translationally modified stable MTs , which were closely associated with P40763 activation . To explore the molecular signaling events contributing to control of the cardiac MT network , we stimulated cardiac myocytes with an Î±-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine ( PE ) , and observed increased tubulin content without changes in detyrosinated ( glu-tubulin ) stable MTs . In contrast , the hypertrophic interleukin-6 ( P05231 ) family cytokines increased both the glu-tubulin content and glu-MT density . When we examined a role for P29323 in regulating cardiac MTs , we showed that the MEK/ P29323 -inhibitor U0126 increased glu-MT density in either control cardiac myocytes or following exposure to hypertrophic agents . Conversely , expression of an activated Q02750 mutant reduced glu-tubulin levels . Thus , P29323 signaling antagonizes stabilization of the cardiac MT array . In contrast , inhibiting either O60674 with AG490 , or P40763 signaling with Stattic or siRNA knockdown , blocked cytokine-stimulated increases in glu-MT density . Furthermore , the expression of a constitutively active P40763 mutant triggered increased glu-MT density in the absence of hypertrophic stimulation . Thus , P40763 activation contributes substantially to cytokine-stimulated glu-MT changes . Taken together , our results highlight the opposing actions of P40763 and P29323 pathways in the regulation of MT changes associated with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy .
