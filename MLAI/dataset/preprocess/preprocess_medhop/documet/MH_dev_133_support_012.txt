M2 macrophages phagocytose rituximab-opsonized leukemic targets more efficiently than m1 cells in vitro . Because macrophages have been implicated as major players in the mechanism of action of rituximab , we have investigated the factors that modulate their tumor cell killing potential . Human macrophages , differentiated in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes , were used in binding and phagocytosis assays using B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma target cells opsonized with rituximab . Phagocytosis was maximal at 0.1 microg/ml rituximab and was not significantly affected by P11836 expression levels or by P08637 polymorphism at position 158 ( DB00161 / DB00120 ) . The role of FcgammaRs was demonstrated by complete inhibition of phagocytosis by excess human Igs . Because macrophages can be differentiated to M1- or M2-type cells with either GM- P04141 or P09603 , respectively , and can be classically activated by proinflammatory stimuli ( P01579 /LPS ) or undergo alternative activation with cytokines such as P05112 or P22301 , we have analyzed the effect of these different polarization programs on the phagocytosis mediated by rituximab . Macrophages differentiated in presence of P09603 showed a 2- to 3-fold greater phagocytic capacity compared with GM- P04141 -induced cells . Furthermore , addition of P22301 significantly increased , whereas P05112 decreased phagocytosis by both P09603 - and GM- P04141 -differentiated macrophages . LPS/ P01579 had little effect . Expression of CD16 , CD32 , and CD64 in different macrophage populations correlated with phagocytic activity . Interestingly , several B lymphoma cell lines were observed to secrete 400-1300 pg/ml P22301 in vitro , and coculture of human macrophages with lymphoma conditioned medium increased significantly their phagocytic capacity . Our data suggest that cytokines secreted by lymphoma cells can favor alternate activation of macrophages with a high phagocytic capacity toward rituximab-opsonized targets .
