Thrombospondin 1 and its mimetic peptide DB05434 decrease angiogenesis and inflammation in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease . OBJECTIVE : Vascular abnormalities and expression of proangiogenic factors have been repeatedly reported in inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) . Thrombospondin 1 ( P07996 -1 ) is a protein well known for its antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties . Using the dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) model , the role of P07996 -1 in Q9UKU7 has been investigated in vivo . METHODS : P07996 -1-deficient mice ( P07996 -1-/- ) and WT mice were treated with DSS for 7 days . Disease activity indices , myeloperoxidase activity ( P05164 ) and histology were analyzed . Microvascular density ( P53602 ) was quantified using immunohistochemistry ( IMH ) with CD31 antibody . TGF-beta(1) , basic FGF , P15692 , P01375 and MMPs protein levels were evaluated by IMH and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Mice were treated with DB05434 ( Abbott Laboratories ) , an antiangiogenic P07996 peptide , using miniosmotic pumps for 7 days . RESULTS : P07996 -1(-/-) mice had a worse clinical outcome and exhibited severe signs of rectal bleeding compared to the WT controls . The P07996 -1-/- mice showed a higher level of crypt damage and deeper lesions . The grade of inflammation and the levels of P05164 activity were also significantly higher in colons of P07996 -1-/- mice . P07996 -1-/- mice displayed higher P53602 in focal areas of the colon after only 3 days of DSS treatment . Furthermore , clinical severity of the colitis and angiogenesis was significantly diminished when mice was treated with DB05434 . CONCLUSIONS : These findings directly link P07996 -1 as a protective factor in Q9UKU7 and suggest antiangiogenesis treatment , including compounds such as DB05434 as an adjuvant therapy for Q9UKU7 .
