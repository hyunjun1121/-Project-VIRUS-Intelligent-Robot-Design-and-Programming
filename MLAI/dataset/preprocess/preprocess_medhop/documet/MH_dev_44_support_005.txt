A study on co-localization of DB00094 and its receptor in rat hippocampus . It has been known that DB00644 , LH and their receptors exist in hippocampal neurons . However , whether DB00094 and its receptor also exist in hippocampal neurons remained unknown yet . In situ hybridization , double-labeled immunofluorescence stain and double-labeled immunohistochemistry stain in adjacent sections were used in our research to study the distribution , co-localization of DB00094 and its receptor and co-localization of DB00094 and P30968 in rat hippocampus . The result found that pyramidal neurons from P00915 to P22748 region and granule neurons in dentate gyrus could express DB00094 and its receptor , majority of hippocampal neurons co-expressed DB00094 and its receptor , DB00094 and P30968 . These suggested that hippocampal neurons not only express DB00094 but also act as DB00094 target cells . DB00094 may regulate the function of hippocampal neurons by ways of paracrine or autocrine . At the same time , DB00644 may regulate the function of DB00094 neuron in hippocampus through P30968 .
