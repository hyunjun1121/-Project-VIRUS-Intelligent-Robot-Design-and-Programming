Effects of cholinoceptor and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonism on erythromycin-induced canine intestinal motility disruption and emesis . 1. Erythromycin administration is associated with gastrointestinal problems , disturbed gastrointestinal motility and emesis . This study in the dog investigates the underlying mechanisms . 2 . Intestinal myoelectrical activity and the occurrence and latency of emesis were recorded in eight conscious dogs . All drugs were administered intravenously . 3 . Erythromycin ( 7 mg kg-1 ) increased contractions of the proximal small intestine , and caused emesis in all fasted dogs and in 5 dogs after food . Atropine ( 50 mg kg-1 min-1 ) and hexamethonium ( 10 mg kg-1 h-1 ) partially inhibited the GI motility effects but did not significantly reduce emesis . 4 . DB01233 at a high dose ( 2 mg kg-1 h-1 ) reduced the incidence of emesis in the presence of increased intestinal motility , but a low dose ( 150 micrograms kg-1 h-1 ) was ineffective . 5 . A 5-hydroxytryptamine3 ( 5- Q9H205 ) receptor antagonist , MDL 72222 ( 1 mg kg-1 ) , reduced emesis when given alone and combined with metoclopramide ( low dose ) . The Q13639 receptor agonist BRL24924 ( DB04917 , 1 mg kg-1 ) had no effect on emesis either alone in combination with metoclopramide . 6 . In conclusion , erythromycin-induced GI motility disturbances and emesis are not causally related . Whereas the increase in intestinal smooth muscle activity is possibly cholinergically mediated , emesis occurs at least in part via a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic mechanism , but does not involve the dopamine system .
