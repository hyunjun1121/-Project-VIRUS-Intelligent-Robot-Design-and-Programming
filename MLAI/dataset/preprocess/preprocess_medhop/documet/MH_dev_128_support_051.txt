HepG2 human hepatoma cells express multiple cytokine genes . Although cytokines are known to be involved in the regulation of a variety of hepatocellular functions , hepatocytes themselves are generally considered only targets but not producers of these important mediators . In order to investigate whether cells of hepatocellular linages are a potential source of various regulatory cytokines we have estimated the multiple cytokine gene expression in the culture of well differentiated human HepG2 hepatoma cells using RT-PCR . Our findings demonstrate that HepG2 cells express mRNAs for interferon gamma ( P01579 ) , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) , transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) , macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( P09603 ) , oncostatin-M ( P13725 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule ( P05362 ) , interleukin 4 ( P05112 ) , P05113 , P13232 , P22301 , IL-11 , IL-12 and P05231 receptor ( IL-6R ) . At the same time the expression of IL-1 , P60568 , P08700 , P05231 , P29965 and IL-2R genes was not detected . It was concluded that hepatocytes are potential producers of a variety of cytokines , some of them being able to regulate hepatocellular functions directly , while others are important regulators of leukocyte activity . Thus , on the one hand , hepatocytes may express autoregulatory cytokines and on the other hand , influence the functions of other liver cells like Kupffer , Ito or endothelial cells . Due to their large amount , liver parenchymal cells could be an important source of sytemically acting pro- and anti-inflammatory and other regulatory cytokines .
