Stimulation of Xenopus P47900 receptor activates P13569 in A6 cells . Nucleotide binding to purinergic P2Y receptors contributes to the regulation of a variety of physiological functions in renal epithelial cells . Here , we investigate the regulatory mechanism of the P47900 receptor agonist 2-methylthioadenosine diphosphate ( 2-MeSADP ) on Cl- transport in A6 cells , a commonly used model of the distal section of the Xenopus laevis nephron . Protein and mRNA expression analysis together with functional measurements demonstrated the basolateral location of the Xenopus P47900 receptor . 2-MeSADP increased intracellular [ Ca2+ ] and DB02527 and Cl- efflux , responses that were all inhibited by the specific P47900 receptor antagonist P59665 2179 . Cl- efflux was also inhibited by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( P13569 ) blocker glibenclamide . Inhibition of either protein kinase A ( PKA ) or the binding between A-kinase-anchoring proteins ( AKAPs ) and the regulatory PKA RII subunit blocked the 2-MeSADP-induced activation of P13569 , suggesting that PKA mediates P47900 receptor regulation of P13569 through one or more AKAPs . Further , the truncation of the PDZ1 domain of the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-2 ( Q15599 ) inhibited 2-MeSADP-dependent stimulation of Cl- efflux , suggesting the involvement of this scaffolding protein . Activation or inhibition of PKC had no effect per se on basal Cl- efflux but potentiated or reduced the 2-MeSADP-dependent stimulation of Cl- efflux , respectively . These data suggest that the X laevis P47900 receptor in A6 cells can increase both DB02527 /PKA and Ca2+/PKC intracellular levels and that the PKC pathway is involved in P13569 activation via potentiation of the PKA pathway .
