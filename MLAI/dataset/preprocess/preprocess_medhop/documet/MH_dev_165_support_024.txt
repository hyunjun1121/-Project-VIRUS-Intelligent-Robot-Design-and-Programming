P37231 ligands are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor to mediate ligand-dependent transcriptional regulation . Activation of PPARgamma by the naturally occurring ligand , 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 ( 15d-PGJ2 ) , or members of a new class of oral antidiabetic agents , e.g. BRL49653 and ciglitizone , has been linked to adipocyte differentiation , regulation of glucose homeostasis , inhibition of macrophage and monocyte activation , and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation . Here we report that human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) express PPARgamma mRNA and protein . Activation of PPARgamma by the specific ligands 15d-PGJ2 , BRL49653 , or ciglitizone , dose dependently suppresses HUVEC differentiation into tube-like structures in three-dimensional collagen gels . In contrast , specific PPARalpha and -beta ligands do not affect tube formation although mRNA for these receptors are expressed in HUVEC . PPARgamma ligands also inhibit the proliferative response of HUVEC to exogenous growth factors . Treatment of HUVEC with 15d-PGJ2 also reduced mRNA levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptors 1 ( Flt-1 ) and 2 ( Flk/ P35968 ) and urokinase plasminogen activator and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) mRNA . Finally , administration of 15d-PGJ2 inhibited vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the rat cornea . These observations demonstrate that PPARgamma ligands are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo , and suggest that PPARgamma may be an important molecular target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis .
