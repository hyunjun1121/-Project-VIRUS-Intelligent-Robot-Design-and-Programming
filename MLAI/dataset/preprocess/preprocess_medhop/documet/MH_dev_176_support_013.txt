DB08901 suppresses the development of myeloid and lymphoid malignancies associated with P11362 abnormalities . Myeloid and lymphoid malignancies associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( P11362 ) abnormalities are characterized by constitutively activated P11362 kinase and rapid transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma . Molecular targeted therapies have not been widely used for stem cell leukemia/lymphoma ( SCLL ) . DB08901 ( DB08901 ) , which potently inhibits native and mutant P11274 - P00519 , also targets the FGFR family . Using murine BaF3 cells , stably transformed with six different P11362 fusion genes , as well as human KG1 cells expressing activated chimeric P11362 and five newly established murine SCLL cell lines , we show that ponatinib ( < 50 nM ) can effectively inhibit phosphoactivation of the fusion kinases and their downstream effectors , such as PLCÎ³ , Stat5 and Src . DB08901 also significantly extended survival of mice transplanted with different SCLL cell lines . DB08901 administered at 30 mg/kg daily also significantly delayed , or even prevented , tumorigenesis of KG1 cells in xenotransplanted mice . Furthermore , we demonstrate that ponatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human P28906 + progenitor cells transformed by chimeric P11362 fusion kinases . Overall , our data provide convincing evidence to suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of P11362 fusion kinases with ponatinib is likely to be beneficial for patients with SCLL and perhaps for other human disorders associated with dysregulated P11362 activity .
