Altered expression of inflammation-related genes in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques . OBJECTIVE : Inflammation is a pivotal process in atherosclerosis development and progression , but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely obscure . We have conducted an extensive expression study of atherosclerotic plaques to identify the inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis . METHODS : We studied 11 human carotid plaques , their respective adjacent regions and 7 control arteries from different subjects . Expression of 92 genes was studied by TaqMan low-density array human inflammation panel . Human aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells were used for in vitro experiments . RESULTS : The mRNA levels of 44/92 genes ( 48 % ) differed significantly between the tissues examined ( 13 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated ) . Dysregulated genes encode molecules belonging to different functional classes although most of them encode enzymes involved in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway . The expression of Q16647 and P43119 genes was decreased in human aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells stimulated with oxLDL and P01375 -Î± . CONCLUSIONS : This study not only reveals several dysregulated genes in human lesions but also focuses the role played by the genes involved in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway during atherosclerotic development . The decrease of Q16647 and P43119 expression after oxLDL treatment mirrors the decreased mRNA levels in atherosclerotic lesions versus control arteries , which suggests that oxidation is important for Q16647 and P43119 regulation in human vessel cells during atherosclerosis development .
