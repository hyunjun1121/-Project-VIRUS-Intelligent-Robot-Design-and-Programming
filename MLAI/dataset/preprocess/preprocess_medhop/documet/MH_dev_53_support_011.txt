Influence of in-situ synthesized exopolysaccharides on the quality of gluten-free sorghum sourdough bread . The majority of gluten-free breads on the market are of poor sensory and textural quality . Exopolysaccharides ( EPS ) formed from sucrose during sourdough fermentation can improve the technological properties of gluten-free breads and potentially replace hydrocolloids . In this study , the influence of in situ formed EPS on dough rheology and quality of gluten-free sorghum bread was investigated . DB09255 forming Weissella cibaria MG1 was compared to reuteran producing Lactobacillus reuteri P01282 and fructan forming L. reuteri P28062 . EPS containing bread batters were prepared by adding 10 % and 20 % of sourdough . As control served batters and bread containing sourdoughs fermented without sucrose and batters and bread without sourdough addition . The amount of EPS formed in situ ranged from 0.6 to 8.0 g/kg sourdough . EPS formed during sourdough fermentation were responsible for the significant decrease in dough strength and elasticity , with in situ formed dextran exhibiting the strongest impact . Increased release of glucose and fructose from sucrose during fermentation enhanced COâ‚‚ production of yeast . Organic acids in control sourdough breads induced hardening of the bread crumb . EPS formed during sourdough fermentation masked the effect of the organic acids and led to a softer crumb in the fresh and stored sorghum bread . Among EPS , dextran showed the best shelf life improvements . In addition to EPS , all three strains produced oligosaccharides during sorghum sourdough fermentation contributing to the nutritional benefits of gluten-free sorghum bread . Results of this study demonstrated that EPS formed during sourdough fermentation can be successfully applied in gluten-free sorghum flours to improve their bread-making potentials .
