DB00065 therapy for sarcoidosis ( lupus pernio ) . Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology in which the primary cytokine tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha appears to play a major role . Older immune-modulating drugs including corticosteroids , antimalarials and thalidomide , as well as cytotoxic drugs with immune modulatory effects , have been used to control disease . We present a patient with severe mutilating cutaneous sarcoidosis ( lupus pernio ) who had showed only partial response to courses of a wide spectrum of immune modulators and cytotoxic therapies , and who had developed significant side-effects due to prolonged high-dose corticosteroids . However , the patient 's cutaneous disease responded rapidly to the P01375 inhibitor infliximab .
