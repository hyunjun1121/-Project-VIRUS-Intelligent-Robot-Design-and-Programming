Expression and biological activity of O95477 in alveolar epithelial cells . The mechanisms used by alveolar type I pneumocytes for maintenance of the lipid homeostasis necessary to sustain these large squamous cells are unknown . The processes may involve the DB00171 -binding cassette transporter A1 ( O95477 ) , a transport protein shown to be crucial in apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I ) -mediated mobilization of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid . Immunohistochemical data demonstrated the presence of O95477 in lung type I and type II cells and in cultured pneumocytes . Type II cells isolated from rat lungs and cultured for 5 days in 10 % serum trans-differentiated toward cells with a type I-like phenotype which reacted with the type I cell-specific monoclonal antibody VIIIB2 . Upon incubation of the type I-like pneumocytes with agents that up-regulate the O95477 gene ( 9-cis-retinoic acid [ 9cRA ] and 22-hydroxycholesterol [ 22-OH , 9cRA/22-OH ] ) , O95477 protein levels were enhanced to maximum levels after 8 to 16 hours and remained elevated for 24 hours . In the presence of apoA-I and 9cRA/22-OH , efflux of radioactive phospholipid and cholesterol from pneumocytes was stimulated 3- to 20-fold , respectively , over controls . Lipid efflux was inhibited by DB01599 . DB02772 density gradient analysis of the media from stimulated cells incubated with apoA-I identified heterogeneous lipid particles that isolated at a density between 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml , with low or high apoA-I content . Thus , pneumocytes with markers for the type I phenotype contained functional O95477 protein , released lipid to apoA-I protein , and were capable of producing particles resembling nascent high-density lipoprotein , indicating an important role for O95477 in the maintenance of lung lipid homeostasis .
