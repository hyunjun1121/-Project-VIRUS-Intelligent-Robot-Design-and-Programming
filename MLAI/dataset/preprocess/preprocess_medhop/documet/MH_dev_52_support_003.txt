Roles of protein kinase C and actin-binding protein 280 in the regulation of intracellular trafficking of dopamine D3 receptor . P35462 ( D(3)R ) is expressed mainly in parts of the brain that control the emotional behaviors . It is believed that the improper regulation of D(3)R is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia . Desensitization of D(3)R is weakly associated with G protein-coupled receptor kinase ( GRK ) /beta-arrestin-directed internalization . This suggests that there might be an alternative pathway that regulates D(3)R signaling . This report shows that D(3)R undergoes robust protein kinase C ( PKC ) -dependent sequestration that is accompanied by receptor phosphorylation and the desensitization of signaling . PKC-dependent D(3)R sequestration , which was enhanced by P05771 or -delta , was dynamin dependent but independent of GRK , beta-arrestin , or caveolin 1 . Site-directed mutagenesis of all possible phosphorylation sites within the intracellular loops of D(3)R identified serine residues at positions 229 and 257 as the critical amino acids responsible for phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced D(3)R phosphorylation , sequestration , and desensitization . In addition , the LxxY endocytosis motif , which is located between residues 252 and 255 , was found to play accommodating roles for PMA-induced D(3)R sequestration . A continuous interaction with the actin-binding protein 280 ( filamin A ) , which was previously known to interact with D(3)R , is required for PMA-induced D(3)R sequestration . In conclusion , the PKC-dependent but GRK-/beta-arrestin-independent phosphorylation of D(3)R is the main pathway responsible for the sequestration and desensitization of D(3)R . Filamin A is essential for both the efficient signaling and sequestration of D(3)R .
