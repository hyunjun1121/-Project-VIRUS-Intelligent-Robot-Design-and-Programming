Transforming properties of chimeric P41212 -JAK proteins in Ba/ P13726 cells . The involvement of the cytokine signaling pathway in oncogenesis has long been postulated . Recently , rearrangements of the gene encoding the tyrosine O60674 ( O60674 ) have been reported in human leukemias indicating a direct JAK-signal transduction and activator of transcription ( P35610 ) -mediated leukemic process . The leukemia-associated P41212 - O60674 fusion protein is formed by the oligomerization domain of the translocated ets leukemia ( P41212 ) protein fused to the catalytic domain of O60674 . P41212 -mediated oligomerization results in a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that , in turn , is able to confer growth factor independence to the murine hematopoietic interleukin-3 ( P08700 ) -dependent Ba/ P13726 cell line . Results of the present study indicate that fusion proteins containing the oligomerization domain of P41212 and the tyrosine kinase domains of Jak1 , Jak2 , P52333 , or P29597 share similar properties and are able to efficiently substitute for the survival and mitogenic signals controlled by P08700 , without concomitant activation of the P08700 receptor . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated Stat5 as the only activated Stat factor in P41212 -Jak2- and P41212 -Jak1-expressing cells , whereas other Stats , namely Stat1 and Stat3 , could be detected in P41212 - P52333 - , P41212 - P29597 - , and also in P41212 - P00519 -expressing Ba/ P13726 cells . High levels of expression of the Stat5-target genes pim-1 , osm , and Cis were observed in all the cytokine-independent cell lines . Furthermore , the expression of a dominant negative form of Stat5A markedly interfered with the growth factor independence process mediated by P41212 -Jak2 in Ba/ P13726 cells . Because the P11274 - P00519 and P41212 -PDGFbetaR oncoproteins also activate Stat5 , activation of this factor should be a crucial step in activated tyrosine kinase-mediated leukemogenesis .
