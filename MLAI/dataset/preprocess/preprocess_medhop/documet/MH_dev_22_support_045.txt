The adjuvant treatment of P04626 -positive breast cancer . About 15-20 % of patients with early stage breast cancer present with tumors that have overexpression or amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( P04626 ) gene . Before 2005 , these individuals had an increased risk of recurrence and death , but since then their outcomes have substantially improved with the adoption in most countries of adjuvant trastuzumab as a standard component of therapy for P04626 -positive early-stage breast cancer . Consequently , access to high-quality and accurate P04626 testing methods is critical to accurately determine P04626 status , guide treatment decisions , and ultimately improve clinical outcomes . In 2012 , the humanized monoclonal anti-HER antibody trastuzumab was the only approved P04626 -targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting . Data from the first generation of trials combining it with various chemotherapy regimens showed significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival ( DFS/OS ) . Based on results from five randomized clinical trials , a trastuzumab-containing regimen for up to 1 year is now considered standard for all patients with P04626 -positive tumors larger than 1 cm in size who would have fulfilled eligibility to those studies , and this recommendation is sometimes extended to patients with stage I tumors greater than 0.5 cm ( T1b ) . Second generation adjuvant studies with other P04626 -targeted agents like lapatinib and pertuzumab are ongoing , and newer drugs like DB05773 and neratinib are being actively tested in the metastatic setting .
