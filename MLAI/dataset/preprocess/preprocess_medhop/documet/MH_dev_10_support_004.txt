Mechanism of aminobisphosphonate action : characterization of alendronate inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway . DB00630 ( ALN ) , an aminobisphosphonate compound used for the treatment of osteoporosis and other disorders of bone resorption , has been suggested to act by inhibition of the formation of GGPP . In the present study we used an S(10) homogenate fraction of rat liver to show that ALN causes a dose-dependent inhibition of [(3)H]MVA incorporation into sterols and a concomitant increase in incorporation of radiolabel into IPP and DMAPP . We further show that ALN is a potent inhibitor of cytosolic trans-prenyltransferase ( P14324 ) . The inhibition is competitive with respect to allylic pyrophosphate substrates , but not IPP , suggesting that ALN acts as an allylic pyrophosphate analog and binds to the free enzyme . The K(i) is in the 0.5 microM range .
