Antiangiogenic activity of the endocannabinoid anandamide : correlation to its tumor-suppressor efficacy . Endocannabinoids are now emerging as suppressors of key cell-signaling pathways involved in cancer cell growth , invasion , and metastasis . We have previously observed that the metabolically stable anandamide analog , 2-methyl-2'-F-anandamide ( DB00134 -F-AEA ) can inhibit the growth of thyroid cancer in vivo . Our hypothesis was that the anti-tumor effect observed could be at least in part ascribed to inhibition of neo-angiogenesis . Therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the anti-angiogenic activity of DB00134 -F-AEA , to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect and whether DB00134 -F-AEA could antagonize tumor-induced endothelial cell sprouting . We show that DB00134 -F-AEA inhibited P09038 -stimulated endothelial cell proliferation , in a dose-dependent manner , and also induced apoptosis , both effects reliant on cannabinoid P21554 receptor stimulation . Analyzing the signaling pathways implicated in angiogenesis , we observed that the P09038 -induced P29323 phosphorylation was antagonized by DB00134 -F-AEA , and we found that p38 MAPK was involved in DB00134 -F-AEA-induced apoptosis . Moreover , DB00134 -F-AEA was able to inhibit bi-dimensional capillary-like tube formation and activity of matrix metalloprotease P08253 , a major matrix degrading enzyme . Importantly , we demonstrated that DB00134 -F-AEA is also functional in vivo since it inhibited angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic neovascularization model . Finally , DB00134 -F-AEA inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis in a three-dimensional model of endothelial and thyroid tumor cell ( KiMol ) spheroids co-cultures in different 3-D polymeric matrices that resemble tumor microenvironment and architecture . Thus , our results suggest that anandamide could be involved in the control of cancer growth targeting both tumor cell proliferation and the angiogenic stimulation of the vasculature .
