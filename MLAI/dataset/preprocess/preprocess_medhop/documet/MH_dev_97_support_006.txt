Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A promotes angiogenesis and alters steroid-mediated responses in the mammary glands of cycling rats . Prenatal exposure to Q03001 disturbs mammary gland histoarchitecture and increases the carcinogenic susceptibility to chemical challenges administered long after Q03001 exposure . Our aim was to assess the effect of prenatal Q03001 exposure on mammary gland angiogenesis and steroid hormone pathways in virgin cycling rats . Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to either 25 or 250 g/kg/day ( 25 and 250 Q03001 , respectively ) or to vehicle . Female offspring were autopsied on postnatal day ( P01160 ) 50 or 110 . Ovarian steroid serum levels , the expression of steroid receptors and their co-regulators Q9Y6Q9 and Q9Y618 in the mammary gland , and angiogenesis were evaluated . At P01160 50 , all Q03001 -treated animals had lower serum levels of progesterone , while estradiol levels remained unchanged . The higher dose of Q03001 increased mammary ERÎ± and decreased Q9Y6Q9 expression at P01160 50 and P01160 110 . Q9Y618 protein levels were similar among groups at P01160 50 , whereas at P01160 110 , animals exposed to 250 Q03001 showed a lower Q9Y618 expression . Interestingly , in the control and 25 Q03001 groups , Q9Y618 increased from P01160 50 to P01160 110 . At P01160 50 , an increased vascular area associated with higher P15692 expression was observed in the 250 Q03001 -treated rats . At P01160 110 , the vascular area was still increased , but P15692 expression was similar to that of control rats . The present results demonstrate that prenatal exposure to Q03001 alters the endocrine environment of the mammary gland and its angiogenic process . Increased angiogenesis and altered steroid hormone signals could explain the higher frequency of pre-neoplastic lesions found later in life .
