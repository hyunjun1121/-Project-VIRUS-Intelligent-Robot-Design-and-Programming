Intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin and growth hormone releasing factor inhibits food intake in neonatal chicks . Growth hormone releasing factor ( P01286 ) is known to stimulate feeding of rats . Ghrelin , a novel growth hormone ( GH ) -releasing acylated peptide , was recently isolated from rat stomach . It also stimulates the release of GH from the anterior pituitary through the GH secretagogue receptor ( Q92847 ) and feeding in the rat . We have investigated the effects of ghrelin and P01286 on food intake of the neonatal chick . In Experiment 1 , 0 , 1.25 , 2.5 and 5 microg of ghrelin were administered intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v. ) to ad libitum fed birds . In Experiment 2 , the effect of ( i.c.v. ) injection of 0 , 1.25 , 2.5 and 5 microg of P01286 was investigated . Both peptides strongly inhibited food intake of the chick during the 2-h post-injection period . In the third experiment , 0 , 0.5 , 1 and 2 microg of ghrelin was injected i.c.v. in chicks previously deprived of food for 3 h . Food intake was again inhibited by ghrelin in a dose-dependent manner . These results suggest that the mechanisms for feeding of the neonatal chick through GH release are different from mammals .
