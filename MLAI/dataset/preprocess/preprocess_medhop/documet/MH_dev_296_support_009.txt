Involvement of Rho-kinase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced interleukin-6 release from P13671 glioma cells . P01375 ( P01375 ) -alpha stimulated interleukin ( IL ) -6 release and induced the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit ( MYPT ) -1 , a Rho-kinase substrate . The P05231 release was significantly suppressed by Y-27632 and fasudil , Rho-kinase inhibitors . Although IkappaB inhibitor suppressed the P01375 -induced P05231 release , the Rho-kinase inhibitors did not affect the P01375 -induced IkappaB phosphorylation . P01375 induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein ( Q96HU1 ) kinase , stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) /c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , and Q8TCB0 / Q8NFH3 Q96HU1 kinase . The P01375 -induced P05231 release was suppressed by SB203580 , a p38 MAPK inhibitor , or SP600125 , a SAPK/JNK inhibitor , but not by PD98059 , a Q96HU1 kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor . The Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the P01375 -induced phosphorylation of both p38 Q96HU1 kinase and SAPK/JNK . Rho-kinase , which has been used for the clinical treatment of cerebral vasospasms , may be involved in other central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders such as traumatic injury , stroke , neurodegenerative disease and neuropathic pain . P01375 , a proinflammatory cytokine that affects the CNS through cytokines , such as P05231 , release from neurons , astrocytes and microglia . Therefore , we investigated the involvement of Rho-kinase in the P01375 -induced P05231 release from rat P13671 glioma cells . These results strongly suggest that Rho-kinase regulates the P01375 -induced P05231 release at a point upstream from p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK in P13671 glioma cells . Therefore , Rho-kinase inhibitor may be considered to be a new clinical candidate for the treatment of CNS disorders in addition to cerebral vasospasms .
