Puerarin alleviates noise-induced hearing loss via affecting PKCγ and GABAB receptor expression . Noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) often results from prolonged exposure to high levels of noise . Our previous study revealed that during the development of NIHL , the expression of protein kinase C γ subunit ( PKCγ ) and GABAB receptor ( GABABR ) was changed within the cochlear nuclear complex ( CNC ) , suggesting that these molecules might be the potential targets for the treatment of NIHL . As an extending study , here we focused on puerarin , a major isoflavonoid extracted from Pueraria lobota , which has been used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases , and investigated whether it could protect against NIHL by acting on PKCγ and GABABR . Transgenic Q99259 -GFP knock-in mice were subjected to the NIHL model and their auditory functions were evaluated by the auditory brainstem response thresholds and distortion product oto-acoustic emission signals . Our results showed that 200mg/kg puerarin treatment ameliorated the thresholds of auditory brainstem response of NIHL mice significantly . Triple immunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy results revealed that GFP-positive neurons in the superficial layers of CNC expressed both PKCγ and Q9UBS5 , and Q99259 -positive terminals contacted PKCγ- or Q9UBS5 -positive neurons . Immunoblotting and RT-PCR results showed that NIHL increased the expression of PKCγ but decreased that of Q9UBS5 and O75899 at both protein and mRNA levels in the CNC . Puerarin significantly attenuated the increased expression of PKCγ but elevated the reduced expression of Q9UBS5 and O75899 after noise exposure . Thus , we provided the first evidence that puerarin ameliorated the auditory functions of NIHL mice , and this effect may be due to its ability to regulate the expression of PKCγ and GABABR .
