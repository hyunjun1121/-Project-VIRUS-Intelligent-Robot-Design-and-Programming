Induction of platelet-derived growth factor B/ DB00102 by the v-erbA oncogene in glial cells . The v-erbA oncogene codes for a mutated form of the thyroid hormone receptor TR/ P10827 . Thyroid hormone ( triiodothyronine , DB00279 ) regulates glial functions such as myelination and both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes have been shown to express thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs ) . To study putative effects of v-erbA on glial precursors , we have expressed it in a glial clonal cell line established from early embryonal mouse brain . We have found that v-erbA increases cell survival in serum-free conditions . Moreover , v-erbA-expressing cells show a substantial growth in the presence of insulin or P05019 , whereas normal and TR/c-erbA-over-expressing cells progressively degenerate . By Northern blotting , immunofluorescence , immunoprecipitation , and neutralization experiments , we show that v-erbA actions are mediated by an increase in the levels of PDGF B/ DB00102 mRNA and protein . We used anti-PDGF receptor and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to show the constitutive activation of PDGF receptors in B3.1 + v-erbA cells , and neutralizing anti-PDGF antibodies to demonstrate that v-erbA enhances the secretion of active PDGF into the culture medium . Our data indicate that v-erbA induces PDGF B/ DB00102 , a factor involved in the generation of gliomas , the most common central nervous system tumor in humans .
