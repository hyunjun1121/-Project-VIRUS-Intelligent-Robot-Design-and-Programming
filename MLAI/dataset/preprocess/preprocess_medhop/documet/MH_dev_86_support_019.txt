Dose selection of siltuximab for multicentric Castleman 's disease . PURPOSE : DB09036 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin ( IL ) -6 with high affinity and specificity ; P02741 ( CRP ) is an acute-phase protein induced by P05231 . CRP suppression is an indirect measurement of P05231 activity . Here , modeling and simulation of the pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) relationship between siltuximab and CRP were used to support dose selection for multicentric Castleman 's disease ( CD ) . METHODS : PK/PD modeling was applied to explore the relationship between siltuximab PK and CRP suppression following intravenous siltuximab infusion in 47 patients with B cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( n = 17 ) , multiple myeloma ( n = 13 ) , or CD ( n = 17 ) . DB09036 was administered as 2.8 , 5.5 , or 11 mg/kg q2wks , 11 mg/kg q3wks , or 5.5 mg/kg weekly . Simulations of studied or hypothetical siltuximab dosage regimens ( 15 mg/kg q4wks ) were also performed to evaluate maintenance of CRP suppression below the cutoff value of 1 mg/L . RESULTS : A two-compartment PK model and an inhibitory indirect response PD model adequately described the serum siltuximab and CRP concentration-time profiles simultaneously . PD parameter estimates were physiologically plausible . For all disease types , simulations showed that 11 mg/kg q3wks or 15 mg/kg q4wks would reduce serum CRP to below 1 mg/L after the second dose and throughout the treatment period . CONCLUSIONS : PK/PD modeling was used to select doses for further development of siltuximab in multicentric CD . The dosing recommendation was also supported by the observed efficacy dose-response relationship . CRP suppression in the subsequent randomized multicentric CD study was in agreement with the modeling predictions .
