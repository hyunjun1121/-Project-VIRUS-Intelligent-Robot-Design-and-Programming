Activation of the farnesoid X receptor represses Q8NBP7 expression in human hepatocytes . The purpose of this study was to determine whether bile acids ( BAs ) modulate hepatic pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 ( Q8NBP7 ) gene expression . Immortalized human hepatocytes were treated with various BAs . Chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) treatment specifically decreased both Q8NBP7 mRNA and protein contents . Moreover , activation of the BA-activated farnesoid X receptor ( Q96RI1 ) by its synthetic specific agonist GW4064 also decreased Q8NBP7 expression . Of functional relevance , coadministration of DB06777 counteracted the statin-induced Q8NBP7 expression , leading to a potentiation of P01130 activity . This study suggests that a transcriptional repression of Q8NBP7 by DB06777 or Q96RI1 agonists may potentiate the hypolipidemic effect of statins .
