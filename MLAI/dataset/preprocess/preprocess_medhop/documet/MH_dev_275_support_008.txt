DB01892 is a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and P09917 . The acylphloroglucinol derivative hyperforin is the major lipophilic constituent in the herb Hypericum perforatum ( St. John 's wort ) . The aim of the present study was to investigate if hyperforin as well as extracts of H. perforatum can suppresses the activities of P09917 ( P09917 ) and cyclooxygenases ( P36551 ) , key enzymes in the formation of proinflammatory eicosanoids from arachidonic acid ( AA ) . In freshly isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 , hyperforin inhibited P09917 product formation with IC(50) values of about 1-2 microM , in the absence or presence of exogenous AA ( 20 microM ) , respectively , being almost equipotent to the well-documented P09917 inhibitor zileuton ( IC(50) = 0.5-1 microM ) . Experiments with purified human P09917 demonstrate that hyperforin is a direct P09917 inhibitor ( IC(50) approximately 90 nM ) , acting in an uncompetitive fashion . In thrombin- or ionophore-stimulated human platelets , hyperforin suppressed P23219 product ( 12(S)-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid ) formation with an IC(50) of 0.3 and 3 microM , respectively , being about 3- to 18-fold more potent than aspirin . At similar concentrations , hyperforin suppressed P23219 activity in platelets in presence of exogenous AA ( 20 microM ) as well as in cell-free systems . DB01892 could not interfere with P35354 product formation and did not significantly inhibit 12- or 15-LO in platelets or leukocytes , respectively . We conclude that hyperforin acts as a dual inhibitor of P09917 and P23219 in intact cells as well as on the catalytic activity of the crude enzymes , suggesting therapeutic potential in inflammatory and allergic diseases connected to eicosanoids .
