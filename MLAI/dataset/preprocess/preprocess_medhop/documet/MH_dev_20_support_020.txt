The role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and cyclooxygenase pathways in the inhibitory serotonergic response to the pressor effect elicited by sympathetic stimulation in chronic sarpogrelate treated rats . We have demonstrated that the antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors produces an enhancement of serotonergic sympathoinhibitory effect by P28221 and P34969 activation . The aim of this work was to determine mechanisms involved in the 5-hydroxytriptaminergic inhibitory action on the pressor responses elicited by sympathostimulation in pithed rats treated with a 5-HT2 receptor blocker . The blockade of 5-HT2 receptors was induced by orally sarpogrelate treatment ( 30 mg/kg/day ) . Two weeks later , animals were anaesthetized and pithed . A bolus injection of 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one ( ODQ ) ( 10 µg/kg ) , a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor , or indomethacin ( 2mg/kg ) , a non-selective P36551 inhibitor , prior to the infusion of ( 2S ) (+)-5-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-2-(dimethylamino)tetralin , AS-19 ( 5 µg/kg/min ) were not able to abolish its inhibitory action . However , i.v. administration of glibenclamide ( 20mg/kg ) , a blocker of DB00171 -sensitive K(+) channels , completely reversed AS-19 sympathoinhibitory action . The inhibitory effect of 2-[5-[3-(4-methylsulfonylamino)benzyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-1H-indol-3-yl]ethanamine , L-694,247 ( 5 µg/kg/min ) was abolished by indomethacin , whereas pretreatment with ODQ had no effect . DB04743 ( 3mg/kg ) , a P35354 inhibitor , completely reversed the inhibitory action of L-694,247 , whereas 1- [ [ 4,5-bis (4-methoxyphenyl)-2-thiazolyl ] carbonyl ] -4-methylpiperazine hydrochloride ( FR122047 ) ( 3mg/kg ) , a P23219 inhibitor , partially blocked this action . The sympathoinhibition by 5-HT ( 20 µg/kg/min ) could not be elicited after i.v. treatment with indomethacin plus glibenclamide . In conclusion , these results suggest that in chronic sarpogrelate-treated rats , the inhibitory serotonergic effect of the pressor responses induced by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow via P34969 and P28221 receptor activation is mediated by KATP channel-mediated smooth muscle hyperpolarization and the P36551 pathway , respectively .
