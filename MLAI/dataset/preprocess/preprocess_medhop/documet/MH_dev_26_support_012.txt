P05067 is a primary androgen target gene that promotes prostate cancer growth . P10275 ( AR ) is a critical transcription factor that regulates various target genes and contributes to the pathophysiology of prostate cancer hormone dependently . Here , we identify amyloid precursor protein ( P05067 ) as a primary androgen target through chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) combined with genome tiling array analysis ( ChIP-chip ) . ChIP-treated DNA were obtained from prostate cancer LNCaP cells with R1881 or vehicle treatment using AR or acetylated histone H3 antibodies . Ligand-dependent AR binding was further enriched by PCR subtraction . Using chromosome 21/22 arrays , we identified P05067 as one of the androgen-regulated genes with adjacent functional AR binding sites . P05067 expression is androgen-inducible in LNCaP cells and P05067 immunoreactivity was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer . Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies revealed that P05067 promotes the tumor growth of prostate cancer . The present study reveals a novel P05067 -mediated pathway responsible for the androgen-dependent growth of prostate cancer . Our findings will indicate that P05067 could be a potential molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer .
