Cytokine release syndrome after blinatumomab treatment related to abnormal macrophage activation and ameliorated with cytokine-directed therapy . DB09052 is a P15391 /CD3-bispecific T-cell receptor-engaging ( BiTE ) antibody with efficacy in refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Some patients treated with blinatumomab and other T cell-activating therapies develop cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) . We hypothesized that patients with more severe toxicity may experience abnormal macrophage activation triggered by the release of cytokines by T-cell receptor-activated cytotoxic T cells engaged by BiTE antibodies and leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) . We prospectively monitored a patient during blinatumomab treatment and observed that he developed HLH . He became ill 36 hours into the infusion with fever , respiratory failure , and circulatory collapse . He developed hyperferritinemia , cytopenias , hypofibrinogenemia , and a cytokine profile diagnostic for HLH . The HLH continued to progress after discontinuation of blinatumomab ; however , he had rapid improvement after P05231 receptor-directed therapy with tocilizumab . Patients treated with T cell-activating therapies , including blinatumomab , should be monitored for HLH , and cytokine-directed therapy may be considered in cases of life-threatening CRS . This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00103285 .
