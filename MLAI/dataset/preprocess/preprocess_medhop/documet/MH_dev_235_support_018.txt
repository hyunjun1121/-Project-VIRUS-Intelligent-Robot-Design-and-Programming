Adipocyte differentiation-related protein reduces the lipid droplet association of adipose triglyceride lipase and slows triacylglycerol turnover . Although neutral lipid storage droplets are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells , very little is known about how their synthesis and turnover are controlled . Adipocyte differentiation-related protein ( Q99541 ; also known as adipophilin ) is found on the surface of lipid droplets in most mammalian cell types . To learn how Q99541 affects lipid storage , we stably expressed the protein in human embryonic kidney 293 ( P29320 293 ) cells , which express little endogenous Q99541 . As expected , Q99541 was targeted to the surface of lipid droplets and caused an increase in triacylglycerol ( TAG ) mass under both basal and oleate-supplemented conditions . At least part of the increased mass resulted from a 50 % decrease in the rate of TAG hydrolysis in Q99541 -expressing cells . Furthermore , Q99541 expression increased the fraction of total cellular TAG that was stored in lipid droplets . Q99541 expression induced a striking decrease in the association of adipose triglyceride lipase ( Q96AD5 ) and mannose-6-phosphate receptor tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa with lipid droplets and also decreased the lipid droplet association of several other unknown proteins . Transient expression of Q99541 in two other cell lines also reduced the lipid droplet association of catalytically inactive Q96AD5 . We conclude that the reduced lipid droplet association of Q96AD5 and/or other lipases may explain the decrease in TAG turnover observed in Q99541 -expressing P29320 293 cells .
