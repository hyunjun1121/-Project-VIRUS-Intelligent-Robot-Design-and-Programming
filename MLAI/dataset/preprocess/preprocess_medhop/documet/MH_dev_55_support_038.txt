Effects of the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone on endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro : differences between human and mouse . P37231 ( PPARgamma ) agonists and PPARgamma/alpha dual agonists have been or are being developed for clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemias . A common tumor finding in rodent carcinogenicity studies for these agonists is hemangioma/hemangiosarcoma in mice but not in rats . We hypothesized that increased endothelial cell proliferation may be involved in the mechanism of Q07869 agonist-induced vascular tumors in mice , and we investigated the effects on endothelial cells utilizing troglitazone , the first clinically used PPARgamma agonist , in vivo and in vitro . DB00197 ( 400 and 800 mg/kg/day ) induced hemangiosarcomas in mice in a 2-year bioassay . We showed that troglitazone increased endothelial cell proliferation in brown and white adipose tissue and liver in mice at sarcomagenic doses after 4 weeks of treatment . DB00197 was cytotoxic both to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells ( HMEC1 ) and mouse mammary fat pad microvascular endothelial cells ( MFP MVEC ) at high concentrations . However , MFP MVEC were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of troglitazone based on the much lower LC(50) in HMEC1 ( 17.4 muM ) compared to MFP MVEC ( 92.2 muM ) . DB00197 increased the proliferation and survival of MFP MVEC but not HMEC1 in growth factor reduced conditions . Our data demonstrate that troglitazone may induce hemangiosarcomas in mice , at least in part , through enhancement of survival and proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells . Such an effect does not occur with human cells , suggesting that human may react differently to exposure to Q07869 agonists compared with mice .
