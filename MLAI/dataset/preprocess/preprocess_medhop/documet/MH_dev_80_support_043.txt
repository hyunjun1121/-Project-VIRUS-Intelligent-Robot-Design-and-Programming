5-Hydroxytryptamine induces cyclooxygenase-2 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells : Mechanisms involving Src , PKC and MAPK activation [ corrected ] . Considering the importance of 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) and cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) products in vascular pathology , we investigated the effects of 5-HT on P36551 expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) , and to provide mechanistic insights into these effects . VSMCs were enzymatically isolated from aortic media of Wistar rats . Incubation of VSMCs with 5-HT for 24h stimulated prostaglandin I(2) production , but this stimulation was completely suppressed by NS-398 , a selective P35354 inhibitor . 5-HT induced transient P35354 , but not P23219 , protein and mRNA expression in concentration- and time-dependent manners . This effect of 5-HT was completely inhibited by sarpogrelate , a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist . 5-HT-induced P35354 expression was markedly blunted by Ca(2+) depletion ; GF 109203X , a protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor ; Q99463 , an inhibitor of Src-family tyrosine kinase ( Src ) ; PD 98059 , an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( P29323 ) activation ; SB 203580 , an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ; and SP 600125 , an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) . 5-HT activated P29323 and p38 MAPK , followed by JNK activation . Q99463 inhibited these activations , while GF 109203X inhibited only JNK activation . Furthermore , PD 98059 inhibited JNK activation . These results suggest that 5-HT induces P35354 expression in rat VSMCs , and that PKC , Src , and MAPK activation are each essential for the full expression of P35354 pathways .
