[ Medical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism : role of calcimimetics ] . Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) is a common endocrinological process , characterized by chronic elevation of serum concentrations of calcium and parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . The only intervention able to cure the disease is parathyroidectomy . However , there are few valid medical alternatives for patients whose PHPT is unresolved by surgery , or in those with contraindications for surgery or who refuse the procedure . The discovery of calcium-sensing receptors ( CaSRs ) , which regulate PTH secretion according to extracellular calcium concentrations , has allowed specific anti-parathyroid drugs called calcimimetics to be designed . DB01012 is an allosteric modulator of P41180 that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in controlling serum calcium values and in reducing PTH levels in patients with PHPT . The exact role of calcimimetics in the overall management of PHPT is promising and should be considered in future clinical practice guidelines .
