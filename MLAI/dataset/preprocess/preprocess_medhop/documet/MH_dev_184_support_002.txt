Ca2+ response of rat mesangial cells to DB00171 analogues . The aim of this investigation was to characterise the effects of DB00171 analogues and UTP on the single cell intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) in cultured rat mesangial cells . Typically , there were two phases in the Ca2+ response to the agonists , an initial fast transient peak and a subsequent slower decline , or plateau , phase . For the peak amplitude in [Ca2+]i the agonists had about equal effect . But when taking in consideration the percentage of responding cells and the integrated Ca2+ response over 1 min , the order of efficacy of nucleotide agonists ( 100 microM ) was UTP = DB00171 > ATPgammaS > ADP = 2MeS- DB00171 ( 2-methylthio- DB00171 ) . DB00640 , AMP and beta,gamma-Me- DB00171 ( 100 microM ) had no effect . DB04786 ( 100 microM ) and reactive blue ( 50 microM ) decreased the number of responding cells . Removing Ca2+ from the bath diminished neither the peak in [Ca2+]i nor the percentage of responding cells , but the average [Ca2+]i increase in 1 min was significantly reduced . The results indicate that P41231 receptors are present in rat mesangial cells but it can not be excluded that there are receptors distinct from P41231 which also mediate a rise in [Ca2+]i .
