Review article : the effects of antitumour necrosis factor-α on bone metabolism in inflammatory bowel disease . BACKGROUND : Patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( Q9UKU7 ) are at increased risk of osteoporosis . A number of studies have emerged in recent years indicating that tumour necrosis factor ( P01375 ) blockade appears to have a beneficial effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) in Q9UKU7 patients . AIMS : To provide a review of the available data regarding the effect of the currently licensed anti- P01375 -α therapies on bone metabolism and BMD in Q9UKU7 patients . METHODS : A Medline search was performed using the search terms ' infliximab ' , ' bone metabolism ' , ' Q9UKU7 ' , ' BMD ' , ' bone markers ' , ' adalimumab ' , ' bone disease ' , ' Crohn 's disease ' and ' ulcerative colitis ' . RESULTS : DB00065 has a beneficial effect on bone turnover markers in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patients in the short term . The longest study to date comprising 24 CD patients showed an overall improvement in two bone formation markers - b-alkaline phosphatase ( P = 0.022 ) and osteocalcin ( P = 0.008 ) at 4 months post-treatment . Moreover , the largest study to date comprising 71 CD patients showed significant improvement in sCTx , a bone resorption marker ( P = 0.04 ) at week-8 post-treatment . There is little data looking at the effect of anti- P01375 -α therapy on bone metabolism in ulcerative colitis . Moreover , the long-term effects of anti- P01375 -α therapy on bone structure and fracture risk in Q9UKU7 patients are currently not known . The effect of cessation of anti- P01375 -α therapy on bone metabolism is also unknown . CONCLUSION : Properly controlled long-term trials are needed to fully evaluate the impact of P01375 blockade on bone mineral density .
