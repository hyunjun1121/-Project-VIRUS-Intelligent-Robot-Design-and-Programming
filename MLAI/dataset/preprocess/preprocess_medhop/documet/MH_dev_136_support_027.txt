A phase II trial of sorafenib in metastatic melanoma with tissue correlates . BACKGROUND : DB00398 monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma was explored in this multi-institutional phase II study . In correlative studies the impact of sorafenib on cyclin D1 and Ki67 was assessed . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Thirty-six patients treatment-na√Øve advanced melanoma patients received sorafenib 400 mg p.o. twice daily continuously . Tumor P15056 (V600E) mutational status was determined by routine DNA sequencing and mutation-specific PCR ( MSPCR ) . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) staining for cyclin D1 and Ki67 was performed on available pre- and post treatment tumor samples . The main toxicities included diarrhea , alopecia , rash , mucositis , nausea , hand-foot syndrome , and intestinal perforation . One patient had a RECIST partial response ( PR ) lasting 175 days . Three patients experienced stable disease ( SD ) with a mean duration of 37 weeks . Routine P15056 (V600E) sequencing yielded 27 wild-type ( wt ) and 6 mutant tumors , whereas MSPCR identified 12 wt and 18 mutant tumors . No correlation was seen between P15056 (V600E) mutational status and clinical activity . No significant changes in expression of cyclin D1 or Ki67 with sorafenib treatment were demonstrable in the 15 patients with pre-and post-treatment tumor samples . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : DB00398 monotherapy has limited activity in advanced melanoma patients . P15056 (V600E) mutational status of the tumor was not associated with clinical activity and no significant effect of sorafenib on cyclin D1 or Ki67 was seen , suggesting that sorafenib is not an effective P15056 inhibitor or that additional signaling pathways are equally important in the patients who benefit from sorafenib .
