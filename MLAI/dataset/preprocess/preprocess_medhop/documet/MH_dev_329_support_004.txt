A genetically defined model for human ovarian cancer . Disruptions of the p53 , retinoblastoma ( P06400 ) , and DB01367 signaling pathways and activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) are common in human ovarian cancer ; however , their precise role in ovarian cancer development is not clear . We thus introduced the catalytic subunit of hTERT , the SV40 early genomic region , and the oncogenic alleles of human P01112 or P01116 into human ovarian surface epithelial cells and examined the phenotype and gene expression profile of those cells . Disruption of p53 and P06400 pathway by SV40 early genomic region and hTERT immortalized but did not transform the cells . Introduction of P01112 (V12) or P01116 (V12) into the immortalized cells , however , allowed them to form s.c. tumors after injection into immunocompromised mice . Peritoneal injection of the transformed cells produced undifferentiated carcinoma or malignant mixed Mullerian tumor and developed ascites ; the tumor cells are focally positive for Q8WXI7 and mesothelin . Gene expression profile analysis of transformed cells revealed elevated expression of several cytokines , including interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , P05231 , and P10145 , that are up-regulated by the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway , which is known to contribute to the tumor growth of naturally ovarian cancer cells . Incubation with antibodies to IL-1beta or P10145 led to apoptosis in the ras-transformed cells and ovarian cancer cells but not in immortalized cells that had not been transformed . Thus , the transformed human ovarian surface epithelial cells recapitulated many features of natural ovarian cancer including a subtype of ovarian cancer histology , formation of ascites , Q8WXI7 expression , and nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated cytokine activation . These cells provide a novel model system to study human ovarian cancer .
