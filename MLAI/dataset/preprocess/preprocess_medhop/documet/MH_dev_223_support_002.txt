DB05767 ( Andrographis paniculata extract ) prevents development of murine colitis by inhibiting T-cell proliferation and Q8IXH7 /TH17 responses . BACKGROUND : Extracts of the plant Andrographis paniculata have been used to treat inflammatory diseases in Asian countries . A recent double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of DB05767 ( A. paniculata extract ) has demonstrated its safety and effectiveness for induction of clinical response , remission , and mucosal healing in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . We aimed to determine if DB05767 could prevent the development of T-cell-dependent murine colitis and to define its in vivo mechanism(s) of action . METHODS : CD(+)4CD45RB(high) T cells were transferred into Rag1(-/-) mice and gavaged daily with DB05767 or methyl cellulose ( MC ) . Severity of colitis was evaluated by weight loss , histology , and cytokine expression . RESULTS : Mice treated with MC developed colitis within 4-7 weeks , as evaluated by weight loss , and severe intestinal inflammation . DB05767 -treated mice did not lose weight and displayed only very mild intestinal inflammation . P01375 alpha ( P01375 -α ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1β , interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) , and Q9GZX6 expression were significantly decreased in DB05767 -treated mice . We observed higher percentages of naïve P01730 (+) T cells in the lamina propria of DB05767 -treated mice . At early timepoints DB05767 -treated mice have significantly reduced splenic cell counts , reduced P01730 (+) , and Q16552 (+) , and IFN-γ T(+) cells . Furthermore , DB05767 inhibited the proliferation of P01730 T cells and differentiation into Q8IXH7 /TH17 cells in vitro . CONCLUSIONS : DB05767 inhibits the development of chronic colitis by affecting early T-cell proliferation , differentiation , and TH(1)/TH(17) responses in a T-cell-driven model of colitis , presenting a unique mechanism of action . Our data suggest that DB05767 could be an attractive herbal therapeutic for inflammatory bowel disease .
