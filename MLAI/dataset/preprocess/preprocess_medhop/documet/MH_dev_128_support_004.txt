Association study of 45 candidate genes in nicotine dependence in Han Chinese . Numerous genetic linkages , association studies have been performed in different ethnic groups and revealed many susceptibility loci and genes for nicotine dependence . However , limited similar researches were performed in Han Chinese . This study was designed to investigate the association of candidate genes with nicotine dependence in Han Chinese . We genotyped 384 SNPs within 45 candidate genes with nicotine dependence in a Han Chinese population consisting 223 high nicotine dependent subjects and 257 low nicotine dependent subjects by employing GoldenGate genotyping assay ( Illumina ) . Following association analysis was performed using PLINK software . Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed that nine SNPs located in P35462 ( rs2630351 ) , P21918 ( rs1967550 ) , Q9Y6R4 ( rs2314378 ) , DDC ( rs11575461 ) , Q05901 ( rs4954 ) , O75899 ( rs2779562 ) , P14416 ( rs11214613 and rs6589377 ) and P43681 ( rs2236196 ) were significantly associated with FTND after correction for multiple testing with the p values from 2.59×10(-7) to 9.99×10(-5) . Haplotype-based association analysis revealed haplotype G-A-A formed by rs2630351 , rs167771 and rs324032 and haplotype G-G-G-A formed by rs3773678 , rs2630349 , rs2630351 and rs167771 in P35462 ; haplotype of G-A formed by rs2779562 and rs2808566 in O75899 and haplotype of T-T-A-G-A formed by rs6832644 , rs4057797 , rs9764 , rs4552421 and rs10033119 in P25929 are associated with FTND ( p=3.61×10(-7)-8.78×10(-6) ) . Our results provided confirmation of the previous findings that P14416 , P35462 , DDC , Q05901 , O75899 and P43681 are associated with nicotine dependence . Furthermore , we for the first time report a significant association between nicotine dependence and P21918 , Q9Y6R4 and P25929 . These findings need independent replication in the future studies .
