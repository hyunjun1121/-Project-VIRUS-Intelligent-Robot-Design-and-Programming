DB01095 enhances the inhibitory effects of a selective AT1 receptor blocker , valsartan , on atherosclerosis . We investigated the effects of a P04035 inhibitor ( statin ) on the inhibitory effects of an angiotensin II type-1 receptor ( AT1 ) blocker on atherosclerosis and explored cellular mechanisms . We gave apolipoprotein E null mice a high-cholesterol diet for 10 weeks and measured atherosclerotic plaque area and lipid deposition . Neither 1 mg/kg per day of valsartan nor 3 mg/kg per day of fluvastatin had any effect on blood pressure or cholesterol concentration ; however , both drugs decreased plaque area and lipid deposition after 10 weeks . We then reduced the doses of both drugs to 0.1 mg/kg per day and 1 mg/kg per day , respectively . At these doses , neither drug had an effect on atherosclerotic lesions . When both drugs were combined at these doses , a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesions was observed . Similar inhibitory effects of valsartan or fluvastatin on the expressions of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunits P13498 and p47phox , production of superoxide anion , the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression were observed . These results suggest that concomitant AT1 receptor and cholesterol biosynthesis blockade , particularly when given concomitantly , blunts oxidative stress and inflammation independent of blood pressure or cholesterol-related effects .
