P35354 [ corrected ] activation by endotoxin mediates the decrease in IGF1 , but not in P17936 , [ corrected ] gene expression in the liver . The aim of this work was to analyse the role of cyclooxygenase-2 ( Ptgs2 ) in endotoxin-induced decrease in Igf1 and Igf binding protein-3 ( Igfbp3 ) . For this purpose , male Wistar rats were injected with lipolysaccharide ( LPS ) and/or the Ptgs2 inhibitor meloxicam . LPS induced a significant decrease ( P < 0.01 ) in serum concentrations of Igf1 and Igfbp3 and their mRNAs in the liver . Meloxicam administration prevented the inhibitory effect of LPS injection on serum Igf1 and its liver mRNA . By contrast , meloxicam administration was unable to modify the inhibitory effect of LPS on Igfbp3 . LPS injection also induced a decrease in P10912 ( Ghr ) mRNA in the liver , and meloxicam attenuated this effect . In order to elucidate a direct action of the Ptgs2 inhibitor on the liver cells , the effect of LPS and/or meloxicam was studied in primary cultures of hepatocytes with non-parenchymal cells . LPS decreased Igf1 and Ghr but not Igfbp3 gene expression in liver cells in culture . Meloxicam administration attenuated the inhibitory effect of LPS on Igf1 mRNA , whereas it did not modify the decrease in Ghr mRNA after LPS . The effect of meloxicam on the LPS response does not seem to be mediated by changes in nitric oxide or tumour necrosis factor ( Tnf ) production , since meloxicam did not modify the stimulatory effect of LPS on nitric oxide or Tnfalpha gene expression both in vivo and in vitro . All these data suggest that LPS-induced Ptgs2 activation decreases Igf1 gene expression in liver cells .
