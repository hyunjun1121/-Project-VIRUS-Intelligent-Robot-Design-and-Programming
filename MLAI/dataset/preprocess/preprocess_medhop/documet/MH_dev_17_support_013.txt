Association study of 25 type 2 diabetes related Loci with measures of obesity in Indian sib pairs . Obesity is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and they are metabolically related through the mechanism of insulin resistance . In order to explore how common genetic variants associated with T2D correlate with body mass index ( BMI ) , we examined the influence of 25 T2D associated loci on obesity risk . We used 5056 individuals ( 2528 sib-pairs ) recruited in Indian Migration Study and conducted within sib-pair analysis for six obesity phenotypes . We found associations of variants in P61073 ( rs932206 ) and Q03014 ( rs5015480 ) with higher body mass index ( BMI ) ( β=0.13 , p=0.001 ) and ( β=0.09 , p=0.002 ) , respectively and weight ( β=0.13 , p=0.001 ) and ( β=0.09 , p=0.001 ) , respectively . P61073 variant was also strongly associated with body fat ( β=0.10 , p=0.0004 ) . In addition , we demonstrated associations of P61073 and Q03014 with overweight/obesity ( OR=1.6 , p=0.003 ) and ( OR=1.4 , p=0.002 ) , respectively , in 1333 sib-pairs ( 2666 individuals ) . We observed marginal evidence of associations between variants at six loci ( Q9NQB0 , Q9Y4Z2 , Q9Y261 , LOC646279 , FLJ39370 and Q6YHU6 ) and waist hip ratio ( WHR ) , BMI and/or overweight which needs to be validated in larger set of samples . All the above findings were independent of daily energy consumption and physical activity level . The risk score estimates based on eight significant loci ( including nominal associations ) showed associations with WHR and body fat which were independent of BMI . In summary , we establish the role of T2D associated loci in influencing the measures of obesity in Indian population , suggesting common underlying pathophysiology across populations .
