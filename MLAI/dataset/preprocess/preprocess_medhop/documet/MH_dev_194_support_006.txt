Effective dasatinib uptake may occur without human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ) : implications for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia . We have previously shown that imatinib uptake into chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells is dependent on human organic cation transporter 1 ( O15245 ; O15245 ) , and that low O15245 expression is an important determinant of clinical outcome to imatinib treatment . We hypothesized that dasatinib might be transported differently than imatinib , possibly accounting for its favorable effects in imatinib-resistant patients . (14)C-dasatinib uptake was greater in KCL22-transfected cells with pcDNA3- O15245 plasmid ( high O15245 -expressing cells ) than in control cells ( P = .02 ) . However , hOCT inhibitors did not decrease dasatinib uptake into either control or primary cells , in contrast to their block on imatinib uptake . Dasa-tinib decreased the level of phosphorylated CrkL to 49.9 % in control and 40.3 % in high O15245 -expressing cells . Dasa-tinib efflux was investigated in confluent P08183 -transfected MDCKII cell monolayers . Both dasatinib and imatinib were transported from the basal to the apical layer , indicating that they were transported by P08183 , which was confirmed using the P08183 inhibitor PSC833 ( P = .001 and P < .001 , respectively ) . Compared with imatinib , dasatinib achieved superior intracellular levels and P11274 - P00519 suppression even in cells with low or blocked O15245 . Efflux of dasatinib and imatinib appear similar via P08183 . Dasatinib may therefore offer an advantage over imatinib in patients with low O15245 expression .
