Characterization of the response of human bone marrow endothelial cells to in vitro irradiation . Endothelial cell dysfunction is a classic consequence of radiation damage . Bone marrow endothelial cells ( BMEC ) are a critical component of the stroma in the regulation of haemopoiesis . In animal models , radiation-induced injury of BMEC has been described and a role for BMEC in haemopoietic regeneration after irradiation has been suggested . However , functions of BMEC involved in the haemopoietic regeneration have not been assessed . Therefore we studied the functional response of human BMEC to irradiation using the transformed human BMEC line ( TrHBMEC ) irradiated with 2 . 5 or 10Gy . Our results showed a time- and a dose-dependent increase in damage to irradiated TrHBMEC measured by a decreased number of adherent cells which correlated with increased apoptosis and augmented release of soluble P05362 and P04275 . 2 Gy irradiated TrHBMEC expressed more P05362 on their surface than non-irradiated cells , whereas no change in P19320 , P16581 and P16284 expression was observed . An increased production of DB00099 , GM- P04141 , P10145 , P05231 , IL-1alpha , IL-11 , MIP-1alpha and P21583 and no production of P15018 , P01375 , P07202 and P08700 by 2 Gy irradiated TrHBMEC was observed . The haemopoietic supportive function of TrHBMEC was not altered after a 2 Gy exposure . These results suggest that although radiation induces endothelial cell damage , irradiated cells still support the proliferation and the differentiation of P28906 + haemopoietic cells .
