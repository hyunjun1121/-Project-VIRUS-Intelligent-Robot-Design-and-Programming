Knockdown of Q03426 does not lead to changes in Q96P20 expression or activation . BACKGROUND : Mutations in the Mevalonate Kinase gene ( Q03426 ) are causes of a rare autoinflammatory disease : Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency and its more acute manifestation , Mevalonic Aciduria . The latter is characterized , among other features , by neuroinflammation , developmental delay and ataxia , due to failed cerebellar development or neuronal death through chronic inflammation . Pathogenesis of neuroinflammation in Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency and Mevalonic Aciduria has not yet been completely clarified , however different research groups have been suggesting the inflammasome complex as the key factor in the disease development . A strategy to mimic this disease is blocking the mevalonate pathway , using P04035 inhibitors ( Statins ) , while knock-out mice for Mevalonate Kinase are non-vital and their hemyzygous ( i.e only one copy of gene preserved ) littermate display almost no pathological features . FINDINGS : We sought to generate a murine cellular model closely resembling the pathogenic conditions found in vivo , by direct silencing of Mevalonate Kinase gene . Knockdown of Mevalonate Kinase in a murine microglial cellular model ( BV-2 cells ) results in neither augmented Q96P20 expression nor increase of apoptosis . On the contrary , statin treatment of BV-2 cells produces an increase both in Mevalonate Kinase and Q96P20 expression . CONCLUSIONS : MKD deficiency could be due or affected by protein accumulation leading to Q96P20 activation , opening novel questions about strategies to tackle this disease .
