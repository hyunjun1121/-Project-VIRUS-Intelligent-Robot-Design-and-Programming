Gamma c cytokines condition the progressive differentiation of P01730 + T cells . After their initial antigen encounter in the secondary lymphoid organs , activated T cells must receive additional signals in the peripheral tissues to fully differentiate . Here , we provide evidence that gamma(c) cytokines are critical during this process . Using the Marilyn ( Ml ) T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) transgenic model , we show that male skin grafts are tolerated in the absence of gamma(c) , but that Ml P01730 (+) T cells proliferate normally in response to antigen , traffic to the graft site and recruit an inflammatory response [ including natural killer ( NK ) cells , neutrophils , and macrophages ] that is independent of T cell gamma(c) expression . Whereas wild-type T cells demonstrate a progressive differentiation phenotype from the spleen to the tissues , skin-infiltrating effector T cells ( P16070 (hi)CD62L(lo) ) from gamma(c)(-) mice were phenotypically abnormal with reduced Q9Y6W8 , P26718 , granzyme B , and P01579 expression . These defects could be mapped to deficiencies in P60568 and , surprisingly , P40933 . These results define a late checkpoint in T cell differentiation in the tissues where gamma(c) cytokines , including P40933 , authenticate P01730 (+) T cell effector functions .
