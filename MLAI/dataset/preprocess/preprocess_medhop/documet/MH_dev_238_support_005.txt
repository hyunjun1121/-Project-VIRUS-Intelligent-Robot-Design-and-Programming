Activation of spinal alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor attenuates remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia . The activation of alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( α7-nAchRs ) are currently being considered as novel therapeutic approaches for managing hyperalgesia in inflammation and chronic neuropathic pain , but the role of a7-nAChRs on opioids induced hyperalgesia remain unknown . The present study investigated the effects of α7-nAChRs selective agonists PHA-543613 and type II positive allosteric modulators ( PAMs ) PNU-120596 in remifentanil induced postoperative hyperalgesia . As the results shown , intrathecal treatment with both α7-nAChRs agonists and type II PAMs could attenuate remifentanil induced hyperalgesia by increasing paw withdrawal mechanical threshold ( PWMT ) and paw withdrawal thermal latency ( PWTL ) . Furthermore , we also investigated the protein level of proinflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B subunit ( p- Q13224 ) in the spinal cord . Our data indicated that activation of α7-nAchRs decreased the proinflammatory cytokines ( P01375 -α , P05231 ) and p- Q13224 protein level in the spinal cord . The depression of the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and p- Q13224 after remifentanil treatment may contribute to the anti-hyperalgesia effects of PHA-543613and PNU-120596 via α7-nAChRs . Therefore , our findings demonstrated that α7-nAChRs may be potential candidates for treating opioids induced hyperalgesia .
