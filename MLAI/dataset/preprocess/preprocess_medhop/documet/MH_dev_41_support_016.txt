DB00087 induction and steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in pancreas transplantation . DB00087 is a humanized anti- P31358 antibody that depletes lymphocytes and has been increasingly used as induction agent in transplantation . The impact of alemtuzumab induction immunosuppression in pancreas transplantation was evaluated , with particular reference to steroid avoidance in maintenance . A total of 100 patients who received 102 pancreas transplants ( 83 simultaneous kidney-pancreas [ SPK ] , 15 pancreas after kidney transplantation [ PAK ] and 4 pancreas transplant alone [ P03951 ] ) were included . All patients received two doses of 30-mg alemtuzumab i.v. with tacrolimus ( trough level 8-12 ng/mL ) and mycophenolate mofetil ( DB00688 ,1g/day ) with no maintenance steroids . This analysis included 62 male and 38 female recipients , with mean ( +/-SD ) age of 42 ( +/-7.6 ) years . Median follow-up was 17 months ( range 8-41 months ) . One-year patient , pancreas and kidney graft survival ( actuarial ) was 97 % , 89 % and 94 % , respectively . Overall incidence of rejection was 25 % . Side effects of alemtuzumab administration included thrombocytopenia ( 14 % ) , pulmonary edema ( 2 % ) and rash ( 1 % ) . Twenty-five percent required reoperations ( 12 % for bleeding ) . Infectious complications included Cytomegalovirus ( CMV,6.8 % ) BK viruria ( 3.8 % ) , fungal infections ( 4 % ) , primary varicella ( 1 % ) and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLD,1 % ) . Eighty-three percent did not require any steroids posttransplant . These results indicate that alemtuzumab is safe and enables pancreas transplantation to be carried out without maintenance steroids in 83 % of cases and acceptable rejection rate .
