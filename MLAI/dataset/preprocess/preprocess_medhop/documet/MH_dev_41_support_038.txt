Mutation of beta-catenin and its protein accumulation in solid and cystic tumor of the pancreas associated with metastasis . P35222 serves not only as a structural component of the P12830 -mediated cell-cell adhesion system , but also as a signaling molecule of the Wnt/wingless pathway . Mutations of beta-catenin and aberrant expression of its protein have been identified in a number of different types of human malignancies . To determine the role of beta-catenin in solid and cystic tumor ( P09683 ) of the pancreas , a rare neoplasm usually observed in young females , we examined three primary tumors and one corresponding liver metastatic tumor presented in pediatric patients . Single strand conformation polymorphism and neucleotide sequencing analysis confirmed a TCT right curved arrow TTT somatic mutation at codon 37 changing serine to phenylalanine in one of the primary tumors and its corresponding metastatic tumor . Immunohistochemical analysis displayed abnormally strong nuclear and widespread cytoplasmic expression of beta-catenin in these tumors with the mutation . Our observations suggest that , in some SCTs of the pancreas presented in the pediatric age group , mutated beta-catenin has an important oncogenic effect .
