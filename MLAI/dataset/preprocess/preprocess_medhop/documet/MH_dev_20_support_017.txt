Interaction between endothelial differentiation-related factor-1 and calmodulin in vitro and in vivo . P62158 ( P62158 ) is the principal Ca(2+) receptor protein inside the cell . When activated by Ca(2+) , P62158 binds and activates target proteins , thus altering the metabolism and physiology of the cell . Under basal conditions , calcium-free P62158 binds to other proteins termed P62158 -binding proteins . Recently , we described endothelial differentiation-related factor ( P08476 ) -1 as a protein involved in the repression of endothelial cell differentiation ( Dragoni , I. , Mariotti , M. , Consalez , G. G. , Soria , M. , and Maier , J. A. M. ( 1998 ) J. Biol. Chem. 273 , 31119-31124 ) . Here we report that ( i ) O60869 binds P62158 in vitro and in vivo ; ( ii ) O60869 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by protein kinase C ; and ( iii ) O60869 - P62158 interaction is modulated by the concentrations of Ca(2+) and by the phosphorylation of O60869 by protein kinase C both in vitro and in vivo . In addition , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell stimulates the nuclear translocation of O60869 . On the basis of the high homology of O60869 with multiprotein bridging factor-1 , a transcriptional coactivator that binds TATA-binding protein ( P20226 ) , we also demonstrate that O60869 interacts with P20226 in vitro and in human endothelial cells . We hypothesize that O60869 serves two main functions in endothelial cells as follows : ( i ) to bind P62158 in the cytosol at physiologic concentrations of Ca(2+) and ( ii ) to act in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator through its binding to P20226 .
