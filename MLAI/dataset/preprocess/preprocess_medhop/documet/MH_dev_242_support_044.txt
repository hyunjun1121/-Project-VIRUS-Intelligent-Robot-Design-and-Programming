DB00502 , but not clozapine , produces dramatic catalepsy in delta9-THC-treated rats : possible clinical implications . The effect on rat catalepsy induced by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Delta9-THC ) in association with haloperidol ( HP ) or clozapine ( CLOZ ) administration was investigated . Delta9-THC dose-dependently increased HP ( 0.05-1 mg kg-1 , s.c. ) -induced rat catalepsy , while no catalepsy was observed after CLOZ ( 1-20 mg kg-1 , s.c. ) or Delta9-THC+CLOZ administration . The P21554 antagonist SR141716A ( 0.5-5 mg kg-1 , i.p. ) reversed the increase mediated by Delta9-THC on HP-induced catalepsy . The D2 agonist quinpirole completely reversed the catalepsy induced by both HP and HP+Delta9-THC ; however , higher doses of quinpirole were needed in the presence of Delta9-THC . The M1 antagonist scopolamine and alpha2 antagonist yohimbine were able to reduce the catalepsy induced by HP and HP+Delta9-THC in a similar manner . CLOZ and the 5- Q13049 /2C antagonists ritanserin , RS102221 and SB242084 were more effective in antagonizing HP than HP+Delta9-THC-induced catalepsy.7 HP and CLOZ failed to inhibit in vitro [3H]CP-55,940 binding , while Delta9-THC and SR141716A did not show an appreciable affinity for the D2 receptor . It was suggested that the different effects on rat catalepsy induced by Delta9-THC following HP or CLOZ administration may depend on the receptor-binding profiles of the two antipsychotics . The preferential use of CLOZ rather than HP in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in cannabis abusers was discussed .
