Involvement of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway in the insulin regulation of muscle protein synthesis in streptozotocin-diabetic rats . P01308 resistance in 3-day streptozotocin ( Q11206 ) -treated rats was manifested by the lack of antiproteolytic action of insulin as well as by a reduction of its stimulatory effect on protein synthesis ( -60 % compared with the control group ) in epitrochlearis muscle incubated in vitro . In the present study , we have investigated the diabetes-associated alterations in the insulin signalling cascade , especially the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase ( P19957 kinase ) / P08133 S6 kinase ( P08133 (S6K) ) pathway , in rat skeletal muscle . LY 294002 , a specific inhibitor of P19957 kinase , markedly decreased the basal rate of protein synthesis and completely prevented insulin-mediated stimulation of this process both in control and diabetic rats . Thus , P19957 kinase is required for insulin-stimulated muscle protein synthesis in diabetic rats as in the controls . DB00877 , an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin ( P42345 ) , had no effect on the basal rate of protein synthesis in either of the experimental groups . In control rats , the stimulatory action of insulin on muscle protein synthesis was diminished by 36 % in the presence of rapamycin , whereas in diabetic muscles this reduction amounted to 68 % . The rapamycin-sensitive pathway makes a relatively greater contribution to the stimulatory effect of insulin on muscle protein synthesis in diabetic rats compared with the controls , due presumably to the preferential decrease in the rapamycin-insensitive component of protein synthesis . Neither basal nor insulin-stimulated P08133 (S6K) activity , a signalling element lying downstream of P42345 , were modified by Q11206 -diabetes .
