Neuroprotective effects of huperzine A . A natural cholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . DB04864 ( HupA ) , isolated from Chinese herb Huperzia serrata , is a potent , highly specific and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase . It has been found to reverse or attenuate cognitive deficits in a broad range of animal models . Clinical trials in China have demonstrated that HupA significantly relieves memory deficits in aged subjects , patients with benign senescent forgetfulness , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and vascular dementia ( VD ) , with minimal peripheral cholinergic side effects compared with other AChEIs in use . HupA possesses the ability to protect cells against hydrogen peroxide , beta-amyloid protein ( or peptide ) , glutamate , ischemia and staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis . These protective effects are related to its ability to attenuate oxidative stress , regulate the expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bax , P04637 and caspase-3 , protect mitochondria , and interfere with P05067 metabolism . Antagonizing effects on DB01221 receptors and potassium currents may contribute to the neuroprotection as well . It is also possible that the non-catalytic function of P22303 is involved in neuroprotective effects of HupA . The therapeutic effects of HupA on AD or VD are probably exerted via a multi-target mechanism .
