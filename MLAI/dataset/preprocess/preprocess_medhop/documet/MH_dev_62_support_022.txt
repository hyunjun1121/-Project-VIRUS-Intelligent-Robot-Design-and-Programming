DB08904 compared to natalizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn 's disease : results of a decision analysis . INTRODUCTION : A significant proportion of patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) lose response to antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor α ( P01375 ) . Prior P01375 -antagonist failure is associated with lower rates of response to subsequent P01375 -antagonist therapy . In patients failing two anti- P01375 agents , a choice exists between using a third-anti- P01375 therapy or natalizumab ( NAT ) , an α-4 integrin inhibitor . A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing these competing strategies has not been performed . METHODS : A decision analytic model was constructed to compare the performance of certolizumab pegol ( CZP ) versus NAT in patients with moderate to severe CD . Previously published estimates of efficacy of third-line anti- P01375 therapy and NAT were used to inform the model . Costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars . A 1-year time frame was used for the analysis . RESULTS : In the base case estimate , use of NAT was only marginally more effective [ 0.71 vs. 0.70 quality adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) ] than CZP but was expensive with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( Q03060 ) of $ 381,678 per QALY gained . For CZP 2 months response rate of at least 24 % , NAT had an Q03060 above the willingness-to-pay ( WTP ) threshold . The model was sensitive to the costs of both therapies ; for all CZP costs below $ 2,300 per dose , NAT had higher Q03060 than the WTP threshold . Substituting adalimumab for CZP resulted in similar Q03060 estimates and thresholds for NAT use . CONCLUSIONS : In patients with moderate to severe CD failing two P01375 -antagonists , using a third P01375 -antagonist therapy appears to be a cost-effective strategy without significantly compromising treatment efficacy .
