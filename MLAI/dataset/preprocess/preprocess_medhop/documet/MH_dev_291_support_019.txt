Co-regulation between cyclo-oxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the time-course of murine inflammation . Many in vitro studies have used cell cultures to focus on the relationships between cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( P35228 ) isoforms . We have investigated the time-course of regulation and the role of P35354 and P35228 in a model of experimental inflammation in mice , the air pouch injected with zymosan . This study demonstrates that there is an early acute phase ( 4 h ) mediated mainly by eicosanoids , with high levels of prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) produced by cyclo-oxygenase-1 . In addition , in the later phase ( from 12 h ) there is a participation of nitric oxide ( NO ) and DB00917 accompanied by co-induction of both P35228 and P35354 . These enzymes were detected in migrating leukocytes as well as in macrophages lining the air pouch . Administration of NS398 or indomethacin inhibited DB00917 levels and P36551 activity , but also nitrite levels and P35228 activity , which was accompanied by a reduction in P35228 expression . DB02533 inhibited nitrite levels and P35228 activity in addition to exerting inhibitory effects on the P36551 pathway . Treatment of animals with dexamethasone reduced nitrite and DB00917 concentrations in air pouch exudates , as well as P35228 and P35354 expression in migrating cells . Our results indicate that DB00917 and NO may play in vivo mutual modulatory roles in the inflammatory response caused by zymosan injection into the mouse air pouch , a suitable model to study drugs acting on those pathways .
