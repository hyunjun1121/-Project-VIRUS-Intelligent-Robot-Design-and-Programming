Differential expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in early and late gestational mouse skin and skin wounds . Early gestation fetal mouse skin heals without scars . P00747 activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) has been associated with postnatal organ fibrosis . We hypothesized that the relative balance between urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and P05121 expression in favor of uPA prevents scarring in early fetal skin wounds , whereas a change in favor of P05121 in late gestation results in wound scarring . To evaluate uPA and P05121 expression , 1-mm skin wounds were made in Q14207 .5 and E18 mice and harvested 24 , 48 , or 96 hours postwounding . DB06692 ( 2 mg/ml ) -coated beads were injected into selected Q14207 .5 wounds . Normal skin and skin wounds were evaluated for uPA , P05121 , and collagen expression . We showed that in normal skin uPA level is higher in Q14207 .5 than in E18 mice , while P05121 is lower in Q14207 .5 than in E18 mice . After wounding , Q14207 .5 wounds show a moderate increase in uPA and a minimal increase in P05121 . E18 wounds show a transient increase in uPA but a significant , sustained increase in P05121 . Addition of aprotinin to Q14207 .5 wounds causes an increase in collagen deposition . We conclude that the differential expression of uPA and P05121 in the skin of early vs. late gestation mice may contribute to the degree of scar formation seen after cutaneous injury .
