Alpha-latrotoxin rescues P60880 from DB00083 -mediated proteolysis in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons . The botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) exhibit zinc-dependent proteolytic activity against members of the core synaptic membrane fusion complex , preventing neurotransmitter release and resulting in neuromuscular paralysis . No pharmacologic therapies have been identified that clinically relieve botulinum poisoning . The black widow spider venom Î±-latrotoxin ( LTX ) has the potential to attenuate the severity or duration of BoNT-induced paralysis in neurons via the induction of synaptic degeneration and remodeling . The potential for LTX to antagonize botulinum poisoning was evaluated in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons ( ESNs ) , using a novel screening assay designed around the kinetics of DB00083 activation . Exposure of ESNs to 400 pM LTX for 6.5 or 13 min resulted in the nearly complete restoration of uncleaved P60880 within 48 h , whereas treatment with 60 mM K(+) had no effect . Time-lapse imaging demonstrated that LTX treatment caused a profound increase in Ca(2+) influx and evidence of excitotoxicity , though ESNs remained viable 48 h after LTX treatment . This is the first instance of a cell-based treatment that has shown the ability to eliminate BoNT activity . These data suggest that LTX treatment may provide the basis for a new class of therapeutic approach to BoNT intoxication and may contribute to an improved understanding of long-term mechanisms of BoNT intoxication and recovery . They further demonstrate that ESNs are a novel , responsive and biologically relevant model for LTX research and BoNT therapeutic drug discovery .
