P62158 activates intramolecular electron transfer between the two flavins of neuronal nitric oxide synthase flavin domain . The neuronal NO synthase ( P29475 ) flavin domain , which has similar redox properties to those of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase ( P16435 ) , contains binding sites for calmodulin , DB03147 , Q68DA7 , and NADPH . The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the flavin domain by calcium/calmodulin ( Ca(2+)/ P62158 ) . In this study , we used the recombinant P29475 flavin domains , which include or delete the calmodulin ( P62158 ) -binding site . The air-stable semiquinone of the P29475 flavin domains showed similar redox properties to the corresponding DB03147 -FMNH ( & z.ccirf ; ) of P16435 . In the absence or presence of Ca(2+)/ P62158 , the rates of reduction of an DB03147 - Q68DA7 pair by NADPH have been investigated at different wavelengths , 457 , 504 and 590 nm by using a stopped-flow technique and a rapid scan spectrophotometry . The reduction of the oxidized enzyme ( DB03147 - Q68DA7 ) by NADPH proceeds by both one-electron equivalent and two-electron equivalent mechanisms , and the formation of semiquinone ( increase of absorbance at 590 nm ) was significantly increased in the presence of Ca(2+)/ P62158 . The air-stable semiquinone form of the enzyme was also rapidly reduced by NADPH . The results suggest that an intramolecular one-electron transfer between the two flavins is activated by the binding of Ca(2+)/ P62158 . The F(1)H(2) , which is the fully reduced form of the air-stable semiquinone , can donate one electron to the electron acceptor , cytochrome c . The proposed mechanism of activation by Ca(2+)/ P62158 complex is discussed on the basis of that provided by P16435 .
