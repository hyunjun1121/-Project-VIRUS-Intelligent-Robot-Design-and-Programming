DB00065 chimaeric anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes . Tumour necrosis factor alpha ( P01375 ) is believed to play a major role in apoptotic death of bone marrow cells in myelodysplastic syndromes ( P43034 ) . We explored the efficacy and safety profile of infliximab chimaeric anti- P01375 monoclonal antibody treatment in two P43034 patients . They both had low-/intermediate-risk P43034 , isolated anaemia and elevated circulating levels of P01375 . DB00065 produced no adverse side-effects and resulted in sustained erythroid responses , one major and one minor . Laboratory studies indicated a remarkable decrease in the percentage of apoptotic stem cells in the bone marrow . This preliminary report indicates that infliximab may have an application as P43034 therapy and warrants further investigation .
