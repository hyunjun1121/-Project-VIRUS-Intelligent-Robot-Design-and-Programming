Agents that block fibronectin fragment-mediated cartilage damage also promote repair . OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN : The objective was to determine if agents that suppress catabolism might also enhance repair of irreversibly damaged cartilage . MATERIAL : Articular cartilage from bovine metacarpophalangeal joints was studied in explant culture . TREATMENT : P02751 fragments or P01583 , which potently cause proteoglycan ( PG ) loss from cartilage , were added to cultures also containing the catabolism-blocking agents : insulin-like growth factor-1 , or DB06151 , or DB00125 - DB00145 - DB00128 - DB00133 peptide , and the effects of these agents on blocking PG loss determined . To test for repair or restoration of PG , cartilage was first damaged , damage agents removed and inhibitory agents added . METHODS : Each mean and SD value for cartilage PG content was determined by assays of papain digests of cartilage from three similar cultures . RESULTS : The agents either partially or fully blocked PG loss and promoted repair . CONCLUSIONS : Normally irreversible cartilage damage was reversed by slowing ongoing catabolic processes during attempted repair . Thus , catabolic inhibitors have reparative potential .
