Recombinant human prothrombin kringles have potent anti-angiogenic activities and inhibit Lewis lung carcinoma tumor growth and metastases . P00734 , a protein involved in blood coagulation , is a plasma glycoprotein composed of the Gla domain , two adjacent kringle domains , and a serine protease domain . Kringles are triple-disulfide-loop folding domains , which are found in several other blood proteins . In this study , we showed that recombinant human prothrombin kringle-1 , -2. and -1-2 ( rk-1 , -2 , -1-2 ) all have potent anti-angiogenic activities , which inhibit Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) tumor growth and metastases . Recombinant human prothrombin kringles were expressed by an E. coli expression system and purified to apparent homogeneity from crude E. coli extracts . Purified rk-1 , -2 , -1-2 migrated with a molecular mass of 14 , 19 , and 31 kDa , respectively , on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) under reducing conditions . rk-1 , -2 , -1-2 exhibited potent inhibitory effects on P09038 -stimulated bovine capillary endothelial cell growth with half-maximal concentrations ( ED50 ) of approximately 41 , 55 , and 156 nM , respectively . All of the recombinant human prothrombin kringles also inhibited angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane ( P62158 ) of chick embryos at a dose of 20 microg . Systemic administration of rk-1 , -2 , -1-2 at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day suppressed the growth of primary LLC and at dose of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day inhibited LLC metastases in C57BL6/J mice lungs through their anti-angiogenic effects .
