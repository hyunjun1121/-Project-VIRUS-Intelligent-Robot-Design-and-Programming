Effect of vitamin E on monosodium glutamate induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats . Monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , administered to rats ( by gavage ) at a dose of 0.6 mg/g body weight for 10 days , significantly ( P < 0.05 ) induced lipid peroxidation ( P22079 ) , decreased reduced glutathione ( DB00143 ) level and increased the activities of glutathione-s-transferase ( Q86UG4 ) , catalase and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) in the liver of the animals ; these were observed 24 hr after 10 days of administration . The activities of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( Q9NRA2 ) and gamma glutamyl transferase ( P19440 ) were also significantly increased in the serum , on MSG administration . DB00163 ( 0.2 mg/g body wt ) co-administered with MSG , significantly reduced the P22079 , increased the DB00143 level and decreased the hepatic activities of Q86UG4 , catalase and SOD . The activities of ALT , Q9NRA2 and P19440 in the serum were also significantly reduced . The results showed that MSG at a dose of 0.6 mg/g body wt induced the oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity in rats and vitamin E ameliorated MSG-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity .
