P04626 up-regulates P26447 and several other prometastatic genes in medulloblastoma . Medulloblastoma is frequently disseminated throughout the central nervous system by the time of diagnosis . Conventional therapeutic approaches have not reduced the high mortality associated with metastatic medulloblastoma and little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that promote tumor invasion . Previously , we reported that overexpression of P04626 in medulloblastoma is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis . Here , we demonstrate that P04626 overexpression increases the migration of medulloblastoma cells across basement membranes in vitro . Furthermore , using microarray expression profiling , we show that P04626 up-regulates the expression of prometastatic genes in medulloblastoma cells . These include P26447 , which was previously shown to promote metastasis of breast cancer . We demonstrate that P26447 is a direct target of P04626 signaling in medulloblastoma cells via a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , P31749 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and that levels of P04626 and P26447 are tightly correlated in samples of primary medulloblastoma . Finally , we show that P04626 -dependent medulloblastoma cell invasion in vitro and prometastatic gene expression in vivo can be blocked using the P00533 tyrosine kinase inhibitor DB00530 . These data identify an P04626 driven prometastatic pathway that may provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic medulloblastoma .
