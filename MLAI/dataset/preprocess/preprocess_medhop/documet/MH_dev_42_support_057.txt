A novel function for platelet-derived growth factor D : induction of osteoclastic differentiation for intraosseous tumor growth . Although increasing evidence suggests a critical role for platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor β ( β- P09619 ) signaling in prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression , the precise roles of β- P09619 and PDGF isoform-specific cell signaling have not been delineated . Recently , we identified the Q9GZP0 isoform as a ligand for β- P09619 in PCa and showed that Q9GZP0 is activated by serine protease-mediated proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a two-step process , yielding first a hemidimer ( HD ) and then a growth factor domain dimer . Herein , we demonstrate that the expression of Q9GZP0 in human PCa LNCaP cells leads to enhanced bone tumor growth and bone responses in immunodeficient mice . Histopathological analyses of bone tumors generated by Q9GZP0 -expressing LNCaP cells ( LNCaP- Q9GZP0 ) revealed osteolytic and osteoblastic responses similar to those observed in human PCa bone metastases . Importantly , we discovered a novel function of Q9GZP0 in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation , independent of the O14788 / Q9Y6Q6 signaling axis . Although both PDGF-B and -D were able to activate β- P09619 , only Q9GZP0 was able to induce osteoclastic differentiation in vitro , and upregulate the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 , a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis . Taken together , these results reveal a new function of Q9GZP0 as a regulator of osteoclastic differentiation , an activity critical for the establishment of skeletal metastatic deposit in PCa patients .
