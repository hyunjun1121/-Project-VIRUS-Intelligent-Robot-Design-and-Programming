Chemoproteomics-based kinome profiling and target deconvolution of clinical multi-kinase inhibitors in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells . The pharmacological induction of apoptosis in neoplastic B cells presents a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . We profiled a panel of clinical multi-kinase inhibitors for their ability to induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells . Whereas inhibitors targeting a large number of receptor and intracellular tyrosine kinases including c- P10721 , P36888 , Q06187 and P43405 were comparatively inactive , the CDK inhibitors BMS-387032 and flavopiridol showed marked efficacy similar to staurosporine . Using the kinobeads proteomics method , kinase expression profiles and binding profiles of the inhibitors to target protein complexes were quantitatively monitored in CLL cells . The targets most potently affected were P50750 , cyclin T1 , P51826 /4 and Q03111 , which may represent four subunits of a deregulated positive transcriptional elongation factor ( p-TEFb ) complex . Albeit with lower potency , both drugs also bound the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH containing P50613 . DB02010 and geldanamycin do not affect these targets and thus seem to exhibit a different mechanism of action . The data support a critical role of p-TEFb inhibitors in CLL that supports their future clinical development .
