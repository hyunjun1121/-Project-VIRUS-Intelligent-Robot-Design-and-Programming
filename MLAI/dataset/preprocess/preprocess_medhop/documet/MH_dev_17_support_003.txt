Gain-of-function mutations in transient receptor potential P13671 ( Q9Y210 ) activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ( P27361 /2 ) . Gain-of-function mutations in the canonical transient receptor potential 6 ( Q9Y210 ) gene are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . The mechanisms whereby abnormal Q9Y210 activity results in proteinuria remain unknown . The P27361 /2 MAPKs are activated in glomeruli and podocytes in several proteinuric disease models . We therefore examined whether FSGS-associated mutations in Q9Y210 result in activation of these kinases . In 293T cells and cultured podocytes , overexpression of gain-of-function Q9Y210 mutants resulted in increased P27361 /2 phosphorylation , an effect dependent upon channel function . Pharmacologic inhibitor studies implicated several signaling mediators , including calmodulin and calcineurin , supporting the importance of Q9Y210 -mediated calcium influx in this process . Through medium transfer experiments , we uncovered two distinct mechanisms for P29323 activation by mutant Q9Y210 , a cell-autonomous , P01133 receptor-independent mechanism and a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving metalloprotease-mediated release of a presumed P01133 receptor ligand . The inhibitors KN-92 and H89 were able to block both pathways in mutant Q9Y210 expressing cells as well as the prolonged elevation of intracellular calcium levels upon carbachol stimulation seen in these cells . However , these effects appear to be independent of their effects on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and PKA , respectively . Phosphorylation of DB00156 -70 , DB00133 -282 , and DB00135 -31/285 were not necessary for P29323 activation by mutant Q9Y210 , although a phosphomimetic Q9Y210 S282E mutant was capable of P29323 activation . Taken together , these results identify two pathways downstream of mutant Q9Y210 leading to P29323 activation that may play a role in the development of FSGS .
