DB00013 plasminogen activator and its inhibitor , P05121 , as prognostic markers in breast cancer : from pilot to level 1 evidence studies . BACKGROUND : For optimum management of patients with cancer , accurate assessment of prognosis is essential . The primary determinant of outcome in malignancy is the formation of distant metastases . DB00013 plasminogen activator ( uPA ) is a serine protease causally involved in invasion and metastasis . CONTENT : Data from model systems show that uPA is unequivocally involved in cancer dissemination . Consistent with its role in metastasis , multiple independent groups have shown that high uPA concentrations in primary breast cancers correlate with poor prognosis . For determining outcome , the prognostic impact of uPA was both independent of traditionally used factors and prognostic in patients with axillary node-negative disease . Paradoxically , high concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor ( P05121 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of uPA , also correlate with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer , including the subgroup with node-negative disease . The prognostic value of uPA/ P05121 in axillary node-negative breast cancer patients was recently confirmed in both a prospective randomized trial and a pooled analysis , i.e. , two different level 1 evidence ( LOE-1 ) studies . CONCLUSIONS : uPA and P05121 are among the first biological prognostic factors to have their clinical value validated using LOE-1 evidence studies . Determination of these analytes may help identify low-risk node-negative breast cancer patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy is unnecessary .
