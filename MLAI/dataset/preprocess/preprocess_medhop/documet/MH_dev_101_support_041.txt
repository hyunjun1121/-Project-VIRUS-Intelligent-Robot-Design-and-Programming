P10275 signaling : mechanism of interleukin-6 inhibition . Nonsteroidal signaling via the androgen receptor ( AR ) plays an im-portant role in hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Previously , we have reported that the pleiotropic cytokine , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , inhibited dihydrotestosterone-mediated expression of prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP cells ( Jia et al. , Mol Can Res 2003;1:385-92 ) . In the present study , we explored the mechanisms involved in this inhibition and considered possible effects on AR nuclear translocation , recruitment of transcription cofactors , and the signaling pathways that may mediate this inhibitory effect . P05231 neither induced nuclear localization of the AR nor inhibited dihydrotestosterone-induced nuclear translocation of the receptor . P05231 did not affect AR or P52701 coactivator recruitment to the transcription initiation complex on the prostate-specific antigen enhancer and promoter . Moreover , it did not lead to the recruitment of the corepressor silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor ( Q9Y618 ) or histone deacetylase 1 ( Q13547 ) at the same sites . P05231 did , however , prevent the recruitment of the secondary coactivator , p300 , to the complex and partially inhibited histone H3 acetylation at the same loci . Furthermore , inhibition by P05231 was not mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase or the Akt pathways and was partially abrogated by signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 knock-down using small interfering RNA . Our results show that P05231 modulates androgen action through the differential recruitment of cofactors to target genes . These findings may account for the pleiotropic actions of P05231 in malignant prostate cells .
