DB02134 oxidase inhibitor tungsten prevents the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout mice fed a Western-type diet . Hyperlipidemia enhances xanthine oxidase ( XO ) activity . XO is an important source of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Since ROS are thought to promote atherosclerosis , we hypothesized that XO is involved in the development of atherosclerosis . ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western-type ( WD ) or control diet . In subgroups , tungsten ( 700 mg/L ) was administered to inhibit XO . XO is a secreted enzyme which is formed in the liver as xanthine dehydrogenase ( P47989 ) and binds to the vascular endothelium . High expression of P47989 was found in the liver and WD increased liver P47989 mRNA and P47989 protein expression . WD induced the conversion of P47989 to the radical-forming XO . Moreover , WD increased the hepatic expression of P25942 , demonstrating activation of hepatic cells . Aortic tissue of ApoE(-/-) mice fed a WD for 6 months exhibited marked atherosclerosis , attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine , increased vascular oxidative stress , and mRNA expression of the chemokine KC . Tungsten treatment had no effect on plasma lipids but lowered the plasma XO activity . In animals fed a control diet , tungsten had no effect on radical formation , endothelial function , or atherosclerosis development . In mice fed a WD , however tungsten attenuated the vascular superoxide anion formation , prevented endothelial dysfunction , and attenuated KC mRNA expression . Most importantly , tungsten treatment largely prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice on WD . Therefore , tungsten , potentially via the inhibition of XO , prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice on WD .
