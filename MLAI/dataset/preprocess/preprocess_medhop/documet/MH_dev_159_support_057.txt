DB01017 and tissue-type plasminogen activator for stroke : assessment of interaction potential . BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : New treatment strategies for acute ischemic stroke must be evaluated in the context of effective reperfusion . DB01017 is a neuroprotective agent that inhibits proteolytic enzymes and therefore could potentially both inactivate the clot lysis effect and decrease the damaging effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . This study aimed to determine the effect of minocycline on t-PA clot lysis and t-PA-induced hemorrhage formation after ischemia . METHODS : Fibrinolytic and amidolytic activities of t-PA were investigated in vitro over a range of clinically relevant minocycline concentrations . A suture occlusion model of 3-hour temporary cerebral ischemia in rats treated with t-PA and 2 different minocycline regimens was used . Blood-brain barrier basal lamina components , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , hemorrhage formation , infarct size , edema , and behavior outcome were assessed . RESULTS : DB01017 did not affect t-PA fibrinolysis . However , minocycline treatment at 3 mg/kg IV decreased total protein expression of both P08253 ( P=0.0034 ) and P14780 ( P=0.001 for 92 kDa and P=0.0084 for 87 kDa ) . It also decreased the incidence of hemorrhage ( P=0.019 ) , improved neurologic outcome ( P=0.0001 for Bederson score and P=0.0391 for paw grasp test ) , and appeared to decrease mortality . MMP inhibition was associated with decreased degradation in collagen IV and laminin-alpha1 ( P=0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Combination treatment with minocycline is beneficial in t-PA-treated animals and does not compromise clot lysis . These results also suggest that neurovascular protection by minocycline after stroke may involve direct protection of the blood-brain barrier during thrombolysis with t-PA .
