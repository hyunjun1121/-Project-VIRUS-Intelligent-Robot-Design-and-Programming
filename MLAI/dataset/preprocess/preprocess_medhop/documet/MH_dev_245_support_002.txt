Identification of a lung adenocarcinoma cell line with Q16204 - P07949 fusion gene and the effect of P07949 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo . Rearrangements of the proto-oncogene P07949 are newly identified potential driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma ( LAD ) . However , the absence of cell lines harboring P07949 fusion genes has hampered the investigation of the biological relevance of P07949 and the development of P07949 -targeted therapy . Thus , we aimed to identify a P07949 fusion positive LAD cell line . Eleven LAD cell lines were screened for P07949 fusion transcripts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . The biological relevance of the Q16204 - P07949 gene products was assessed by cell growth , survival and phosphorylation of P27361 /2 and AKT with or without the suppression of P07949 expression using RNA interference . The efficacy of P07949 inhibitors was evaluated in vitro using a culture system and in an in vivo xenograft model . Expression of the Q16204 - P07949 fusion gene in LC-2/ad cells was demonstrated by the mRNA and protein levels , and the genomic break-point was confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing . Mutations in P01116 and P00533 were not observed in the LC-2/ad cells . Q16204 - P07949 was constitutively active , and the introduction of a siRNA targeting the P07949 3' region decreased cell proliferation by downregulating P07949 and P27361 /2 phosphorylation . Moreover , treatment with P07949 -inhibitors , including vandetanib , reduced cell viability , which was accompanied by the downregulation of the AKT and P27361 /2 signaling pathways . DB05294 exhibited anti-tumor effects in the xenograft model . Endogenously expressing Q16204 - P07949 contributed to cell growth . The inhibition of kinase activity could be an effective treatment strategy for LAD . LC-2/ad is a useful model for developing fusion P07949 -targeted therapy .
