DB00126 is dispensable for oxygen sensing in vivo . Prolyl-4-hydroxylation is necessary for proper structural assembly of collagens and oxygen-dependent protein stability of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors ( HIFs ) . In vitro function of HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain ( P20941 ) enzymes requires oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrates with iron(II) and vitamin C serving as cofactors . Although vitamin C deficiency is known to cause the collagen-disassembly disease scurvy , it is unclear whether cellular oxygen sensing is similarly affected . Here , we report that vitamin C-deprived Gulo(-/-) knockout mice show normal HIF-dependent gene expression . The systemic response of Gulo(-/-) animals to inspiratory hypoxia , as measured by plasma erythropoietin levels , was similar to that of animals supplemented with vitamin C . Hypoxic HIF induction was also essentially normal under serum- and vitamin C-free cell-culture conditions , suggesting that vitamin C is not required for oxygen sensing in vivo . Glutathione was found to fully substitute for vitamin C requirement of all 3 P20941 isoforms in vitro . Consistently , glutathione also reduced HIF-1Î± protein levels , transactivation activity , and endogenous target gene expression in cells exposed to CoCl(2) . A Cys201Ser mutation in Q9GZT9 increased basal hydroxylation rates and conferred resistance to oxidative damage in vitro , suggesting that this surface-accessible Q9GZT9 cysteine residue is a target of antioxidative protection by vitamin C and glutathione .
