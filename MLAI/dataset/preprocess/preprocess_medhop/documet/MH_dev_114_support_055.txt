P35354 -dependent and -independent inhibition of proliferation of colon cancer cells by DB00244 . The cyclooxygenase-2 ( P35354 ) /prostaglandin E2 ( DB00917 ) pathway may have a pathogenic role in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Recent studies suggest that DB00244 ( DB00244 ) reduces the risk of inflammatory bowel disease-related CRC , but the mechanism by which DB00244 interferes with CRC cell growth remains unknown . In this study , we have examined whether the negative effect of DB00244 on CRC cells is dependent on P35354 / DB00917 axis inhibition . We show that DB00244 down-regulates both constitutive and P01375 or IL-1beta-induced P35354 in HT-115 and HT-29 cells . Inhibition of P35354 by DB00244 occurs at the RNA and protein level , and is associated with a significant decrease in DB00917 synthesis , arrest of growth and enhanced death of CRC cells . However , exogenous DB00917 does not revert the DB00244 -mediated CRC cell proliferation block . DB00244 also inhibits the growth of DLD-1 , a P36551 -deficient CRC cell line , thus suggesting that the anti-proliferative effect of DB00244 on CRC cells is not strictly dependent on the inhibition of P35354 / DB00917 . Taken together our data indicate that DB00244 causes both a P35354 -dependent and -independent inhibition of CRC cell growth .
