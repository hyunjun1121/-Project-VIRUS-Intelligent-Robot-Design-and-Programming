Effect of the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor amrinone on cytokine and nitric oxide production in immunostimulated J774.1 macrophages . The level of intracellular cyclic nucleotides is a regulatory factor in a variety of immune processes . Increases in intracellular cyclic AMP ( DB02527 ) and/or cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) concentration by the inhibition of phosphodiesterase have been shown to modulate the inflammatory response . DB01427 is a clinically used positive inotropic agent which elevates intracellular DB02527 and cGMP levels by selective inhibition of the phosphodiesterase III isoenzyme . In the current study , we investigated the effect of various concentrations ( 1-300 microM ) of amrinone on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and of nitric oxide ( NO ) in vitro . In cultured murine J774.1 macrophages , 1 ng/ml-10 microg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli O55: P46977 induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( P01375 ) , interleukin-10 , and nitrite ( breakdown product of NO ) . Pretreatment of cells with amrinone caused a dose-dependent suppression of P01375 production in the concentration range of 1-100 microM . Furthermore , this drug suppressed NO production in the range of 30-300 microM . Similarly to the results in the J774.1 cells , amrinone also inhibited P01375 and NO production in the range of 10-100 microM in primary rat peritoneal macrophages . At 300 microM , but not at lower concentrations , amrinone inhibited interleukin-10 production in lipopolysaccharide-treated J774.1 macrophages . Pretreatment of the macrophages with 100 and 300 microM amrinone increased the lipopolysaccharide-elicited translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B . Taken together , our results indicate that the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor amrinone modulates the activation/production of many pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in endotoxin-stimulated cells . It remains to be further investigated how such immunomodulatory effects contribute to the clinical profile of the agent .
