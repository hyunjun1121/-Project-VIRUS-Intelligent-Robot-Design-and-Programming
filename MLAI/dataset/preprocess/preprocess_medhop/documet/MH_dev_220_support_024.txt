DB00819 : future perspective in topical glaucoma therapeutics . Through this review it is contemplated that acetazolamide ( Q9Y6V0 ) , an age-old treatment for glaucoma with a myriad of side effects and inadequate topical effectiveness , may be formulated into a topically effective agent by utilizing various newer formulation approaches of ocular drug delivery . Even though it has a poor solubility and penetration power , various studies mentioned in the review indicate that it is possible to successfully formulate topically effective Q9Y6V0 by using : ( i ) high concentration of the drug , ( ii ) surfactant gel preparations of Q9Y6V0 , ( iii ) Q9Y6V0 loaded into liposomes , ( iv ) cyclodextrins to increase the solubility and hence bioavailability of Q9Y6V0 , and ( v ) viscolyzers and other polymers either alone or in combination with cyclodextrins . With the advent of newer topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( CAIs ) like dorzolamide and brinzolamide , a localized effect with fewer side effects is expected . But whenever absorbed systemically , a similar range of adverse effects ( attributable to sulphonamides ) may occur upon use . Furthermore , oral Q9Y6V0 is reported to be more physiologically effective than 2 % dorzolamide hydrochloride administered topically , even though in isolated tissues dorzolamide appears to be the most active as it shows the lowest IC(50) values for P00918 and P22748 [ M.F. Surgue , J. Ocular Pharmacol. Ther. 12 ( 1996 ) 363-376 ] . Hence , there exists considerable scope for the development of more/equally effective and inexpensive topically effective formulations of Q9Y6V0 . The use of various formulation technologies discussed in this review can provide a fresh impetus to research in this area .
