Q9UEF7 endows hepatoma cells with resistance to anoikis via P35968 /PAK1 activation in hepatocellular carcinoma . Q9UEF7 was originally characterized as an aging suppressor gene that predisposed Q9UEF7 -deficient mice to premature aging-like syndrome . Although Q9UEF7 was recently reported to exhibit tumor suppressive properties during various malignant transformations , the functional role and molecular mechanism of Q9UEF7 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains poorly understood . In our present study , immunohistochemical Q9UEF7 staining levels in a clinical follow-up of 52 hepatoma patients were significantly associated with liver cirrhosis , tumor multiplicity and venous invasion . The overall survival rate of hepatoma patients with high Q9UEF7 expression was significantly lower than those patients with low Q9UEF7 expression . Moreover , Q9UEF7 overexpression increased cellular migration , anchorage-independent growth , and anoikis resistance in hepatoma cells . Q9UEF7 overexpression elevated Q13153 ( PAK1 ) expression and shRNA-mediated PAK1 knockdown and kinase activity inhibition with kinase dead mutant PAK1 K299R coexpression or allosteric inhibitor IPA3 treatment reversed anoikis resistance in Q9UEF7 -overexpressed hepatoma cells . More importantly , the pivotal significance of upregulated P35968 protein levels mediated by Q9UEF7 expression was confirmed by P35968 inhibitor DB06626 and blocking antibody treatment in hepatoma cells . DB06626 treatment sensitized anoikis was reversed by constitutive active mutant PAK1 T423E coexpression in Q9UEF7 -overexpressed hepatoma cells . Conversely , knockdown of Q9UEF7 reduced P35968 /PAK1 dependent anoikis resistance , which could be reversed by PAK1 T423E . These results revealed a novel oncogenic function of Q9UEF7 in promoting anoikis resistance via activating P35968 /PAK1 signaling , thus facilitating tumor migration and invasion during hepatoma progression , which could provide a putative molecular mechanism for tumor metastasis .
