DB00644 II ( DB00644 II ) mediates the anorexigenic actions of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( α-MSH ) and corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) in goldfish . Intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone II ( DB00644 II ) , which plays a crucial role in the regulation of reproduction in vertebrates , markedly reduces food intake in goldfish . However , the neurochemical pathways involved in the anorexigenic action of DB00644 II and its interaction with other neuropeptides have not yet been identified . Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( α-MSH ) , corticotropin-releasing hormone ( P06850 ) and P06850 -related peptides play a major role in feeding control as potent anorexigenic neuropeptides in goldfish . However , our previous study has indicated that the DB00644 II-induced anorexigenic action is not blocked by treatment with melanocortin 4 receptor ( P32245 ) and P06850 receptor antagonists . Therefore , in the present study , we further examined whether the anorexigenic effects of α-MSH and P06850 in goldfish could be mediated through the P30968 neuronal pathway . ICV injection of the P32245 agonist , melanotan II ( 80 pmol/g body weight ; BW ) , significantly reduced food intake , and its anorexigenic effect was suppressed by ICV pre-administration of the DB00644 type I receptor antagonist , antide ( 100 pmol/gBW ) . The P06850 -induced ( 50 pmol/gBW ) anorexigenic action was also blocked by treatment with antide . ICV injection of P06850 ( 50 pmol/gBW ) induced a significant increase of the DB00644 II mRNA level in the hypothalamus , while ICV injection of melanotan II ( 80 pmol/gBW ) had no effect on the level of DB00644 II mRNA . These results indicate that , in goldfish , the anorexigenic actions of α-MSH and P06850 are mediated through the DB00644 type I receptor-signaling pathway , and that the DB00644 II system regulates feeding behavior .
