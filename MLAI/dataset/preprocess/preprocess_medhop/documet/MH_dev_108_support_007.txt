New biologics for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . The prevalence of psoriasis is estimated to be 2.2 % in the United States , and 6-39 % of patients with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis . New advances have been made in developing treatment options . A new human tumor necrosis factor ( P01375 ) -alpha antibody , DB06674 , has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of psoriatic arthritis . In addition , clinical trials of certolizumab pegol , a PEGylated Fab ' fragment of an anti- P01375 monoclonal antibody , show promising results for treating rheumatoid arthritis and suggest that it may be applicable for treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the future . New biologic therapies also include antibodies to interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 . Phase II studies suggest that ustekinumab is effective in alleviating symptoms of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . However , longer studies with radiographic evaluation will be required before their impact on joint destruction can be assessed .
