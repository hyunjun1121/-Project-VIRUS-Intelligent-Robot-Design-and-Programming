P37840 A30P point-mutation generates age-dependent nigrostriatal deficiency in mice . Lewy bodies are mainly composed of alpha-synuclein ( P37840 ) and specific mutations in P37840 gene are related to familial forms of Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The purpose of our study was to generate a mouse line with A30P knock-in point mutation in P37840 gene and to test if a single point-mutation is able to turn otherwise normal P37840 into a toxic form . The behavioral profile of P37840 A30P mice was followed for 16 months . Generally , these mice are healthy and viable without any obvious abnormalities . Starting from the age of 13 months mice developed a significant deficit in motor performance tests related to nigrostriatal function ( ink-test and beam walk ) . In other tests ( motility boxes , rotarod ) mice continuously performed normally . Moreover , P37840 A30P mice expressed the altered sensitivity to Q05940 inhibitor reserpine , possibly reflecting a functional deficiency of dopamine . Indeed , mice at 15 months of age had significantly reduced levels of dopamine and its major metabolite DOPAC in the striatum , and reduced levels of dopamine in the mesolimbic system . The present study confirms that P37840 plays an important role in the development of PD and an insertion of a single point mutation is sufficient to generate age-related decline in specific motor performance . The generated mouse line has a potential to become a model for PD with comparable time course and phenotype .
