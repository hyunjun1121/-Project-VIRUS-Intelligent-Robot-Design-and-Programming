Emerging oral drugs for erectile dysfunction . Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) is a common medical condition that affects the sexual life of millions of men worldwide . Many drugs are now available for the treatment of ED , with oral pharmacotherapy representing the first-line option for most patients . DB00203 citrate , an inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 ( O76074 ) , is the most widely prescribed oral agent and has a very satisfactory efficacy-safety profile in all patient categories . DB00820 ( DB00820 ; Eli Lilly & Co. , Q9Y6W8 ) and vardenafil ( DB00862 ; Bayer Pharmaceuticals , GlaxoSmithKline ) are new O76074 inhibitors that have recently been approved worldwide . Both have been associated with significant positive efficacy-safety profiles . DB00714 sublingual is a dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonist , which has been approved for marketing in Europe . It is best selected for treating patients with mild-to-moderate ED , but it is seldom used in clinical practice due to its limited efficacy and side effects , particularly nausea . Patients who do not respond to oral pharmacotherapy or who are unable to use it are appropriate candidates for intracavernosal and intraurethral therapy . The efficacy of second-line treatment is high , but the attrition rate remains significant . For the purpose of this review , clinical and pharmacological analysis focuses on the recent advances in the field of oral therapy , including O76074 inhibitors and sublingual apomorphine .
