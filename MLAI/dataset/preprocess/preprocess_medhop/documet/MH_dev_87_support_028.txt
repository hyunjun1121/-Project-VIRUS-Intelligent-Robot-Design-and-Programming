Human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation is regulated by DB00917 through differential activation of DB02527 -dependent protein kinase isoforms . The conditions used for in vitro differentiation of hMSCs contain substances that affect the activity and expression of cyclooxygenase enzymes ( P23219 / P35354 ) and thereby the synthesis of prostanoids . hMSC constitutively produce DB00917 when cultivated in vitro . In this study we have investigated effects of DB00917 on proliferation of hMSC . We here demonstrate that one of the main control molecules in the Wnt pathway , P49841 , is phosphorylated at the negative regulatory site ser-9 after treating the cells with DB00917 . This phosphorylation is mediated by elevation of DB02527 and subsequent activation of PKA . Furthermore , DB00917 treatment leads to enhanced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin , thus influencing cell proliferation . The presence of two PKA isoforms , types I and II , prompted us to investigate their individual contribution in DB00917 -mediated regulation of proliferation . Specific activation of PKA type II with synthetic DB02527 analogues , resulted in enhancement of proliferation . On the other side , we found that treatment of hMSC with high concentrations of DB00917 inhibited cell proliferation by arresting the cells in G0/ P55008 phase , an effect we found to be mediated by PKA I . Hence , the two different PKA isoforms seem to have opposing functions in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in these cells .
