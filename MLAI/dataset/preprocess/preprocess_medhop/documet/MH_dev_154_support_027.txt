DB00013 induces matrix metalloproteinase-9/gelatinase B expression in THP-1 monocytes via P27361 /2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation and eicosanoid production . OBJECTIVE : P00749 ( uPA ) regulates cell migration and invasion by pericellular proteolysis and signal transduction events . We characterized the mechanisms by which uPA regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( P14780 ) function in THP-1 monocytes . METHODS AND RESULTS : In THP-1 monocytes , P14780 production induced by urokinase was completely inhibited by the P27361 /2 inhibitor , PD98059 , but not by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor , SB202190 . A dominant negative Q02750 adenovirus also blocked P14780 expression . The effect of urokinase was completely suppressed by genistein and by herbimycin A indicating that tyrosine kinase(s) are required for P14780 production . Bisindolylmaleimide , a protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor , did not decrease P14780 expression suggesting that PKC activation is not required . Key roles for cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( P04054 ) and eicosanoid production were shown by complete inhibition with methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate ( an inhibitor of cytosolic P04054 ) , and indomethacin ( a cyclooxygenase inhibitor ) , with no effect of monoalide , a secretory P04054 inhibitor . uPA stimulated phosphorylation of cytosolic P04054 . CONCLUSIONS : Induction of P14780 by uPA in THP-1 monocytes is via a pathway involving Q02750 - P27361 /2-mediated activation of cytosolic P04054 and eicosanoid generation . These data suggest important roles for eicosanoids in monocyte migration induced by uPA and P14780 .
