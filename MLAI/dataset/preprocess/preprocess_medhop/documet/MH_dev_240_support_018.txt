Q00613 inhibits expression of P05231 through activating transcription factor 3 . The febrile response is a complex physiological reaction to disease , including a cytokine-mediated increase in body temperature and the activation of inflammatory systems . Fever has beneficial roles in terms of disease prognosis , partly by suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines . However , the molecular mechanisms underlining the fever-mediated suppression of inflammatory gene expression have not been clarified . In this study , we showed that heat shock suppresses LPS-induced expression of P05231 , a major pyrogenic cytokine , in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages . Q00613 ( Q00613 ) activated by heat shock induced the expression of activating transcription factor ( P39905 ) 3 , a negative regulator of P05231 , and P18847 was necessary for heat-mediated suppression of P05231 , indicating a fever-mediated feedback loop consisting of Q00613 and P18847 . A comprehensive analysis of inflammatory gene expression revealed that heat pretreatment suppresses LPS-induced expression of most genes ( 86 % ) , in part ( 67 % ) via P18847 . When Q00613 -null and P18847 -null mice were injected with LPS , they expressed much higher levels of P05231 than wild-type mice , resulting in an exaggerated febrile response . These results demonstrate a novel inhibitory pathway for inflammatory cytokines .
