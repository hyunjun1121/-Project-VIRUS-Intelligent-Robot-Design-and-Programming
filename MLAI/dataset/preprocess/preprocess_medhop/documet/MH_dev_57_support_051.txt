[ Expression and regulation of megalin in gallbladder mucosa associated with cholesterol gallstone disease ] . OBJECTIVE : To explore the relationship between expression and regulation of P98164 in gallbladder mucosa and cholesterol gallstone disease . METHODS : Gallbladder mucosa , gallbladder wall , bile , gallstone were collected from 29 patients with cholesterol gallstone disease ( GS ) and 12 patients with gallstone free ( P52945 ) . Lipids of bile and stone were measured by kits . Expression of P98164 and O60494 was analyzed by Real-time PCR . GBC-SD cell line were treated with T0901317 , 9-cis retinoic acid , chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) , the agonists of LXR , RXR , Q96RI1 , respectively . Gene expressions were detected . RESULTS : Biliary cholesterol % molar and CSI increased significantly in GS group [ ( 7.98 +/- 0.44 ) mol % vs ( 4.87 +/- 0.39 ) mol % , P < 0.01 ] . P98164 expression in GS group was significantly higher than that in P52945 group ( P < 0.05 ) and cubilin expression was similar between two groups . In vitro experiments showed that DB06777 markedly increased expression of megalin . CONCLUSION : This study shows that the increased expression P98164 may help to increase cholesterol uptake in gallbladder and play a compensative role in GS . Q96RI1 may participate in the transcription regulating of P98164 .
