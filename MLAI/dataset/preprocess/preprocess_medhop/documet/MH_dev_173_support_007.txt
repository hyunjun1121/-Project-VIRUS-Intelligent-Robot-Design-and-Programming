[ Proteolytic processing by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV generates receptor selectivity for peptide YY ( P10082 ) ] . Two receptor subtypes , Q03519 and P28062 , are known to mediate P10082 biological activity . P10082 1-36 binds to Q03519 and P28062 receptors with equal affinity , whereas the second endogenous form of P10082 , DB05004 , selectively binds to P28062 receptors . Dipeptidyl cleavage thus transforms an unselective Y agonist into a highly selective P28062 agonist , DB05004 . The enzyme responsible for this processing is unknown . Since P10082 has a proline in the penultimate position it is protected from the attack of most unspecific exopeptidases . Only a few exopeptidases are theoretically capable of generating DB05004 from P10082 1-36 . Of the enzymes tested only the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV ( P27487 , E.C. 3.4.14.5 ) cleaved DB00135 -Pro from P10082 1-36 with high activity . Since P27487 is found on the endothelial surface and brush border membranes it can be considered a candidate enzyme for generating DB05004 in vivo , thereby regulating the ratio of Q03519 / P49146 stimulation by P10082 .
