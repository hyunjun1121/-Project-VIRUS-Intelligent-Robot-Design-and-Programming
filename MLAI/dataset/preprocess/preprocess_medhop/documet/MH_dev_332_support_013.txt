Novel di-tertiary-butyl phenylhydrazones as dual cyclooxygenase-2/ P09917 inhibitors : synthesis , P36551 / P28300 inhibition , molecular modeling , and insights into their cytotoxicities . Although dual inhibition of P35354 ( P35354 ) and 5-Lipoxygenase ( 5- P28300 ) enzymes is highly effective than targeting P36551 or P28300 alone , there are only a few reports of examining such compounds in case of colorectal cancers ( CRC ) . In the present work we report that the novel di-tert-butyl phenol-based dual inhibitors DTPSAL , DTPBHZ , DTPINH , and DTPNHZ exhibit significant cytotoxicity against human CRC cell lines . Molecular docking studies revealed a good fit of these compounds in the P35354 and 5- P28300 protein cavities . The inhibitors show significant inhibition of P35354 and 5- P28300 activities and are effective against a panel of human colon cancer cell lines including HCA-7 , HT-29 , SW480 and intestinal Apc10.1 cells as well as the hyaluronan synthase-2 ( Has2 ) enzyme over-expressing colon cancer cells , through inhibition of the DB08818 /CD44v6 cell survival pathway . Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR analyses indicated that the di-tert-butyl phenol-based dual inhibitors reduce the expression of P35354 , 5- P28300 , and CD44v6 in human colon cancer HCA-7 cells , while the combination of CD44v6shRNA and DTPSAL has an additional inhibitory effect on CD44v6 mRNA expression . The synergistic inhibitory effect of Celecoxib and DB04725 on CD44v6 mRNA expression suggests that the present dual inhibitors down-regulate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes through CD44v6 . The compounds also exhibited enhanced antiproliferative potency compared to standard dual P36551 / P28300 inhibitor , viz . DB04725 . Importantly , the HA/CD44v6 antagonist CD44v6shRNA in combination with synthetic compounds had a sensitizing effect on the cancer cells which enhanced their antiproliferative potency , a finding which is crucial for the anti-proliferative potency of the novel synthetic di-tert-butyl phenol based dual P36551 - P28300 inhibitors in colon cancer cells .
