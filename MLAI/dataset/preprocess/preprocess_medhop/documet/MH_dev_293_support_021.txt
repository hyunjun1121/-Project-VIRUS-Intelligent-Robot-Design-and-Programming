A novel tyrosine kinase switch is a mechanism of imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors . P10721 or alpha-platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( alpha- P09619 ) activating mutations are the pathogenic mechanisms that characterize gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST ) . Despite excellent responses to imatinib mesylate ( IM ) , patients are relapsing . We developed an IM-resistant GIST cell line ( GIST-R ) from the IM-sensitive GIST882 cell line ( GIST-S ) by growing these cells in IM . Gene expression profiling ( GEP ) of GIST-S , GIST-R cells and two IM resistant GIST patients demonstrated that P10721 is downregulated implying a major role in IM resistance . Instead , GIST-R cells have acquired IM resistance by overexpressing the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase - P30530 - in a ' kinase switch ' . Further , the two IM resistant GIST patients express P30530 and not c-Kit , seen by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from Kit to P30530 . In GIST-R , P30530 is tyrosine phosphorylated and its ligand growth-arrest-specific gene 6 is overexpressed implying autocrine activation . The kinase switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid . Molecular modeling of the kinase domain of mutant c-Kit ( V654A ) and P30530 showed no binding to IM but efficient binding to DB05216 , a novel c-Kit/ P30530 kinase inhibitor . DB05216 synergizes with docetaxel ( taxotere ) and is cytotoxic to GIST cells .
