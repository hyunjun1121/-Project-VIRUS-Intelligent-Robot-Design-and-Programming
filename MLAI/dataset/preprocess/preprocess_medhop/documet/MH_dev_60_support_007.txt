Does increased leukotriene B4 in type 1 diabetes result from elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity ? Elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( P11597 ) activity has been reported in type 1 diabetic subjects and may be one cause of the high incidence of macrovascular complications in these patients . LDL delivers arachidonic acid ( AA ) , in the form of cholesteryl ester ( CE ) , to cells such as monocytes and fibroblasts , as precursor for eicosanoid synthesis . We discovered that AA content in LDL CE was significantly correlated with P11597 activity , even after controlling for P11597 concentration , in type 1 diabetic children . The production of Q06643 (4) , a potent chemotactic and pro-inflammatory factor which plays a role in atherogenesis , has been shown to be increased in type 1 diabetic patients . We hypothesized that in these subjects , increased AA content in LDL CE , resulting from increased P11597 activity and transient hyperinsulinemia , may lead to enhanced synthesis of Q06643 (4) and subsequently the higher incidence of cardiovascular disease .
