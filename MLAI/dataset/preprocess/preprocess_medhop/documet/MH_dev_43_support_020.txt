Serotonin receptor activation leads to neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival . Serotonin 5-HT1 receptors are implicated in anxiety and depression . These receptors belong to the family A of G-protein-coupled receptors and couple to inhibitory G-proteins . Recent studies show that chronic activation of P08908 receptors leads to proliferation of hippocampal neurons suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the effects of antidepressants . However , the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved are not understood . We used Neuro 2A cells transfected with P08908 receptors and SK-N-SH cells endogenously expressing the receptor to examine the effect of receptor activation on neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth . We find that receptor activation leads to increased neurite outgrowth that can be blocked by the receptor selective antagonist and by treatment with pertussis toxin or lactacystin implicating inhibitory G-proteins and proteasomal degradation in this process . Interestingly , the small G-protein Rap and the transcription factor P35610 -3 are also involved since reducing the levels of Rap1 ( using small interfering RNA ) or P35610 -3 ( using dominant negative P40763 ) significantly blocks P08908 -receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth . The observed increase in the phosphorylation of Src and P35610 -3 , at sites leading to their activation , further supports a crucial role for these proteins in neurite outgrowth . We also find that prolonged activation of endogenous P08908 receptors leads to increased cell survival even under starving conditions ; this is completely blocked by co-treatment with the antagonist . Taken together , these findings indicate that activation of the P08908 receptor leads to a number of neurotropic events by activating a series of signal transduction molecules leading to long-term changes required for neurogenesis .
