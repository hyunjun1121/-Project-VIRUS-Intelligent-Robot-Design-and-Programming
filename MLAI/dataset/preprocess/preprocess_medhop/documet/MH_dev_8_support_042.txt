Successful thrombolysis of a stroke with a pulmonary embolism in a young woman . BACKGROUND : Paradoxical embolism is a rare event , accounting for < 2 % of all arterial emboli . The diagnosis is often difficult , and consequences for the patient can be severe . CASE REPORT : We describe the case of a 35-year-old female physician who presented to our Emergency Department ( ED ) in severe hemodynamic compromise , with an altered level of consciousness and major expressive aphasia 1 day after undergoing a leg varicosal stripping procedure under regional anesthesia . She was successfully thrombolyzed with 0.9 mg/kg of Recombinant Tissue P00747 Activator ( rtPA , DB00009 ) and had a full recovery . CONCLUSION : To our knowledge , this is the first description of a case of massive pulmonary embolism associated with a paradoxical stroke related to patent foramen ovale that was thrombolyzed for both conditions with a " neurological dose " of rtPA . Although thrombolysis was completely successful in this case , indications and contraindications should be thoroughly respected . A more conservative approach with anticoagulation , or a more aggressive approach with surgical thrombectomy , can each potentially have a place in particular cases . Intra-arterial catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous embolectomy are additional options to be considered when available , especially if there are contraindications for systemic thrombolysis .
