P10275 up-regulates insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 ( P24593 ) expression in a human prostate cancer xenograft . The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) are important modulators of IGF action in many tissues including human prostate . IGFBPs and the androgen receptor ( AR ) are expressed in CWR22 , an androgen-dependent epithelial cell human CaP xenograft that retains biological characteristics of human CaPs , including regression following androgen withdrawal and recurrent growth of AR-containing cells in the absence of testicular androgens beginning several months after castration . Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that P24593 is androgen-regulated in CWR22 . P24593 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) decreased by 90 % following castration of tumor-bearing mice compared with noncastrate androgen-stimulated mice . DB00624 treatment of CWR22 tumor-bearing mice 6 or 12 days after castration increased P24593 mRNA 10- to 12-fold . Levels of other IGFBP mRNAs did not change following androgen withdrawal and replacement . P24593 protein in tumor extracts bound 125I-labeled P05019 in ligand blot assays and the amounts of P24593 measured by immunoblotting paralleled the levels of P24593 mRNA . Androgen-induced expression of P24593 was at a maximum level within 24 h after testosterone replacement , whereas the major increase in cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 immunostaining occurred between 24-48 h . This time course suggested P24593 may be a mediator of androgen-induced growth of CWR22 . In tumors that recurred several months following castration , P24593 mRNA and protein increased to levels that approached those in androgen-stimulated CWR22 tumors from noncastrate mice . P24593 immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue specimens from patients was stronger in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent CaP than in areas of intraepithelial neoplasia ( P63167 ) or benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . P24593 mRNA in these specimens was localized predominantly to stromal cells and P24593 protein to epithelial cell membranes .
