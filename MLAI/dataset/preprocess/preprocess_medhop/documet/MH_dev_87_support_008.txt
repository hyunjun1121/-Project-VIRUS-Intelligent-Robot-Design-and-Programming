Antiinflammatory and neurological activity of pyrithione and related sulfur-containing pyridine N-oxides from Persian shallot ( Allium stipitatum ) . ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE : Persian shallot ( Allium stipitatum ) is a bulbous plant native to Turkey , Iran and Central Asia . It is frequently used in folk medicine for the treatment of a variety of disorders , including inflammation and stress . Antiinflammatory and neurological activities of pyrithione and four related sulfur-containing pyridine N-oxides which are prominent constituents of Allium stipitatum were tested . METHODS : The antiinflammatory activity was tested by the ability of the compounds to inhibit cyclooxygenase ( P23219 and P35354 ) , whereas the neurological activities were evaluated by assessing the compounds ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase-A ( P21397 ) and acetylcholinesterase ( P22303 ) . The compounds׳ affinity for the serotonin transport protein ( P31645 ) and the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor were also investigated . RESULTS : 2-[(Methylthio)methyldithio]pyridine N-oxide showed very high antiinflammatory effects which are comparable with those of common pharmaceuticals ( IC₅₀ of 7.8 and 15.4 µM for P23219 and P35354 , respectively ) . On the other hand , neurological activities of the compounds were rather modest . Some compounds moderately inhibited P22303 ( IC₅₀ of 104-1041 µM ) and P21397 ( IC₅₀ of 98-241 µM ) and exhibited an affinity for the P31645 and GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings may help to rationalize the wide use of Persian shallot for the treatment of inflammatory disorders .
