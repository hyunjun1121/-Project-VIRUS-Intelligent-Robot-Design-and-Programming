High glucose enhances angiotensin-II-mediated peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma inactivation in human coronary artery endothelial cells . Activation of the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications of hyperglycemia . Clinical studies have demonstrated that hypoglycemic effects of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma ( P37231 ) activation is potentially associated with a significant decrease of cardiovascular disease events in diabetes patients . We assessed the effect of high glucose on the angiotensin II ( Ang II ) , which induced the inactivation of P37231 and its signal pathways in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) . The expression of angiotensin II receptor I ( AT1R ) protein was analyzed by Western blot and knocked down using siRNA . P37231 activation was examined using a luminometer and a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System . Adhesion molecule expressions of HCAECs were measured using ELISA . Both high glucose and Ang II induced a progressive increase in AT1R protein expression on the HCAECs . DB00197 , a P37231 activator , significantly increased the transcription activity of P37231 in HCAECs in vitro . However , activation of P37231 was significantly inhibited by high glucose and Ang II stimulation . Furthermore , silencing of AT1R expression was able to inhibit the inactivation of P37231 induced by Ang II and high glucose . Meanwhile , expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules was increased by high glucose and Ang II in HCAECs , which is blocked by troglitazone and silencing of AT1R expression . These data strongly suggest high glucose enhanced Ang-II-mediated peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma inactivation and expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules in human coronary artery endothelial cells .
