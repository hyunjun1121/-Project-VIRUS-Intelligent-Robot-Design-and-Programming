A New Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor , MHY219 , Inhibits the Migration of Human Prostate Cancer Cells via Q13547 . Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors are considered novel agents for cancer chemotherapy . We previously investigated MHY219 , a new HDAC inhibitor , and its potent anticancer activity in human prostate cancer cells . In the present study , we evaluated MHY219 molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of prostate cancer cell migration . Similar to suberanilohydroxamic acid ( DB02546 ) , MHY219 inhibited Q13547 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner . MHY219 cytotoxicity was higher in LNCaP ( IC50=0.67 μM ) than in DU145 cells ( IC50=1.10 μM ) and PC3 cells ( IC50=5.60 μM ) after 48 h of treatment . MHY219 significantly inhibited the Q13547 protein levels in LNCaP and DU145 cells at high concentrations . However , inhibitory effects of MHY219 on HDAC proteins levels varied based on the cell type . MHY219 significantly inhibited LNCaP and DU145 cells migration by down-regulation of matrix metalloprotease-1 ( P03956 ) and P08253 and induction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 ( P01033 ) . These results suggest that MHY219 may potentially be used as an anticancer agent to block cancer cell migration through the repression of P03956 and P08253 , which is related to the reduction of Q13547 .
