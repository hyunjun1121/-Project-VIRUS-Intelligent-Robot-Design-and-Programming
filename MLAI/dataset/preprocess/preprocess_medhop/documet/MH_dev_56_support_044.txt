Photoacoustic tomography of joints aided by an DB00005 -conjugated gold nanoparticle contrast agent-an ex vivo preliminary rat study . Monitoring of anti-rheumatic drug delivery in experimental models and in human diseases would undoubtedly be very helpful for both basic research and clinical management of inflammatory diseases . In this study , we have investigated the potential of an emerging hybrid imaging technology-photoacoustic tomography-in noninvasive monitoring of anti- P01375 drug delivery . After the contrast agent composed of gold nanorods conjugated with DB00005 molecules was produced , ELISA experiments were performed to prove the conjugation and to show that the conjugated anti- P01375 -Î± drug was biologically active . PAT of ex vivo rat tail joints with the joint connective tissue enhanced by intra-articularly injected contrast agent was conducted to examine the performance of PAT in visualizing the distribution of the gold-nanorod-conjugated drug in articular tissues . By using the described system , gold nanorods with a concentration down to 1 pM in phantoms or 10 pM in biological tissues can be imaged with good signal-to-noise ratio and high spatial resolution . This study demonstrates the feasibility of conjugating P01375 antagonist pharmaceutical preparations with gold nanorods , preservation of the mechanism of action of P01375 antagonist along with preliminary evaluation of novel PAT technology in imaging optical contrast agents conjugated with anti-rheumatic drugs . Further in vivo studies on animals are warranted to test the specific binding between such conjugates and targeted antigen in joint tissues affected by inflammation .
