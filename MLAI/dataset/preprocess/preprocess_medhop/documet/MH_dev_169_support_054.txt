7E3 F(ab')2 , an effective antagonist of rat alphaIIbbeta3 and alphavbeta3 , blocks in vivo thrombus formation and in vitro angiogenesis . DB00054 ( c7E3 Fab , ReoPro ) blocks P08514 /IIIa and alphavbeta3 and inhibits thrombotic and proliferative events only in humans and non-human primates . The bivalent F(ab')2 fragment is an effective anti-thrombotic agent in canine models . In the present study , 7E3 F(ab')2 was also found to bind to rat P08514 /IIIa ( KD = 27 +/- 4 microg/mL ) and alphavbeta3 ( KD = 9 +/- 8 microg/mL ) , to block in vitro rat platelet aggregation ( IC50 = 16 +/- 6 microg/mL ) , and to inhibit alphavbeta3-mediated microvessel sprout formation in a rat aortic ring assay . Following administration of 7E3 F(ab')2 ( 4 mg/kg ) to rats , platelet aggregation was completely blocked for up to 6 h and thrombus formation in response to a rat abdominal aorta double crush injury was prevented . Effective chronic dosing was achieved with 6 mg/kg daily I.P. injections . In vitro mixing experiments indicated that 7E3 F(ab')2 redistributed to unlabeled platelets in 2 h . Ex vivo , 7E3 F(ab')2 was detected on platelets for up to 4 days after a single 4-mg/kg injection . These data suggest that 7E3 F(ab')2 may be a useful agent to study the effects of P08514 /IIIa and alphavbeta3 blockade in rat models of thrombosis and vascular disease .
