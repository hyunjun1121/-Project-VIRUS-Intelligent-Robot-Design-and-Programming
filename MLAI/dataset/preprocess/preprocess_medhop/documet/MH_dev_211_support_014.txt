DB00741 response to stress is associated with myocardial remodeling in salmonid fishes . Cardiac disease is frequently reported in farmed animals , and stress has been implicated as a factor for myocardial dysfunction in commercial fish rearing . DB00741 is a major stress hormone in teleosts , and this hormone has adverse effects on the myocardium . Strains of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) selected for divergent post-stress cortisol levels [ high responsive ( HR ) and low responsive ( LR ) ] have been established as a comparative model to examine how fish with contrasting stress-coping styles differ in their physiological and behavioral profiles . We show that the mean cardiosomatic index ( CSI ) of adult HR fish was 34 % higher than in LR fish , mainly because of hypertrophy of the compact myocardium . To characterize the hypertrophy as physiological or pathological , we investigated specific cardiac markers at the transcriptional level . HR hearts had higher mRNA levels of cortisol receptors ( MR , GR1 and GR2 ) , increased P53805 levels [ suggesting enhanced pro-hypertrophic nuclear factor of activated T-cell ( NFAT ) signaling ] and increased P15692 gene expression ( reflecting increased angiogenesis ) . Elevated collagen ( Col1a2 ) expression and deposition in HR hearts supported enhanced fibrosis , whereas the heart failure markers P01160 and DB04899 were not upregulated in HR hearts . To confirm our results outside the selection model , we investigated the effect of acute confinement stress in wild-type European brown trout , Salmo trutta . A positive correlation between post-stress cortisol levels and CSI was observed , supporting an association between enhanced cortisol response and myocardial remodeling . In conclusion , post-stress cortisol production correlates with myocardial remodeling , and coincides with several indicators of heart pathology , well-known from mammalian cardiology .
