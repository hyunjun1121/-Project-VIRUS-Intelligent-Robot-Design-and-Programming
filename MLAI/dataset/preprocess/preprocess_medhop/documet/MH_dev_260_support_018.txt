The L-arginine paradox : Importance of the L-arginine/asymmetrical dimethylarginine ratio . Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are still the most frequent cause of death in Western Europe . Pathophysiological experiments revealed in the last years that the vascular endothelium , as well as a result of the synthesis of nitric oxide ( NO ) , is a crucial regulator of vascular function and homeostasis . The vascular endothelium plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology , largely via NO-dependent processes . L- DB00125 is the substrate for the endothelial NO synthase ( P29474 ) to generate NO . Endothelial dysfunction is caused by various cardiovascular risk factors . In most studies , acute and chronic administration of L-arginine has been shown to improve endothelial function in animal models of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis . Therefore , numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate whether dietary L-arginine supplementation can augment NO production in humans and thereby improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation . The most likely mechanism that explains the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction and the effect of L-arginine is that application of L-arginine antagonizes asymmetric dimethylarginine ( DB01686 ) , the endogenous NO synthase ( NOS ) inhibitor . This could solve the L-arginine paradox namely that L-arginine improves NO-mediated vascular function in vivo , although its baseline plasma concentration is about 25- to 30-fold higher than the Michaelis-Menten constant Km of the isolated , purified P29474 in vitro . Recent findings suggest that large , prospective , randomized clinical trials might be needed to identify those patients who are the most likely to benefit from L-arginine . Testing patients for DB01686 and L-arginine plasma levels for calculating the L-arginine/ DB01686 ratio might be an adequate strategy .
