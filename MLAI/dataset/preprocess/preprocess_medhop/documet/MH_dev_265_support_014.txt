DB05332 administration shows reduced megakaryocyte response-capacity and increased myelofibrosis in a mouse model of P35579 -RD . Macrothrombocytopenia in P35579 -related disease ( P35579 -RD ) results from defects in nonmuscular myosin-IIA function . P40238 agonists ( eltrombopag ; romiplostim ) seem to improve hemostasis , but little is known about their biologic effects in P35579 -RD . We administered romiplostim to Myh9(-/-) mice ( 100 Î¼g/kg , every 3 days , during 1 month ) . MKs increased to similar numbers in Myh9(-/-) and wild-type ( WT ) mice ( with an increase in immature MKs ) , but Myh9(-/-) platelet count response was much less ( 2.5-fold vs 8-fold increase ) . A strong increase in MK nuclei emboli in the lung , in WT and Myh9(-/-) mice , indicates increased transmigration of MKs from the BM . Prolonged ( but not acute ) treatment with romiplostim decreased expression of GPIb-IX-V complex and Q9HCN6 , but not of GPIIbIIIa , and bleeding time increased in WT mice . Microcirculation was not altered by the increased number of large platelets in any of the assessed organs , but in Myh9(-/-) mice a much stronger increase in BM reticulin fibers was present after 4 weeks of romiplostim treatment vs WT mice . These data further encourage short-term use of thrombopoietic agents in patients with P35579 -RDs ; however , myelofibrosis has to be considered as a potential severe adverse effect during longer treatment . Reduction of GPIbIX/ Q9HCN6 expression by romiplostim requires further studies .
