Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel oxindole-based RTK inhibitors as anti-cancer agents . Given that receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) have emerged as key regulators of all aspects of cancer development , including proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis and metastasis , the RTK family represents an important therapeutic target for anti-cancer drug development . Oxindole structure has been used in RTK inhibitors such as DB02058 and intedanib . In this study , two series of new heterocyclic compounds containing oxindole scaffold have been designed and synthesized , and their inhibitory activity against the proliferation of nine cancer cell lines has been evaluated . Among them , compounds 9a and 9b displayed the strongest anti-proliferative activity with the IC50s below 10Î¼M . Flow cytometric analysis showed that the compounds 9a and 9b dose-dependently arrested the cell cycle at G0/ P55008 phase . Although the leading compounds DB02058 and intedanib targets P11362 , the kinase activity test revealed that these compounds only showed slight inhibitory activity on P11362 kinase . Further enzymatic test aided by molecular docking simulation in the DB00171 -binding site demonstrated that 9a and 9b are potent inhibitors of c-Kit kinase . These compounds are worthy of further evaluation as anticancer agents .
