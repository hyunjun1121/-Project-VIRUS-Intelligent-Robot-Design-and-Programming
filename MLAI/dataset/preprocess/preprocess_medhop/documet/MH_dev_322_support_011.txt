CP-101,606 , a potent neuroprotectant selective for forebrain neurons . The neuroprotective activity of ( 1S,2S ) -1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)-1-propanol ( CP-101,606 ) , an N-methyl-D-aspartate ( DB01221 ) receptor antagonist structurally similar to ( (+/-)-(R*,S*)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-++ +piperidineethanol ( ifenprodil ) , was investigated in neurons in primary culture . CP-101,606 potently and efficaciously protected hippocampal neurons from glutamate toxicity but was > 900-fold less effective for cerebellar granule neurons . The neuroprotective activity in the hippocampal neurons is mediated through a high affinity binding site distinct from the agonist and thienylcyclohexylpiperidine ( DB01520 ) binding sites of the DB01221 receptor . Autoradiography indicates the CP-101,606 binding site is localized in forebrain , most notably in hippocampus and the outer layers of cortex . The functional selectivity for hippocampal neurons , forebrain localization of binding sites , and structural relation to ifenprodil suggest that CP-101,606 is an DB01221 antagonist highly selective for Q13224 subunit containing receptors .
