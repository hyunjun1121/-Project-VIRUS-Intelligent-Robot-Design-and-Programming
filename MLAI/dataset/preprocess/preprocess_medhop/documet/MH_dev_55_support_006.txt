[ P01308 resistance and hyperlipidemia in the elderly ] . To elucidate the relationship between hyperlipidemias and insulin resistance in the elderly , we conducted three studies : 1 ) determination of the prevalence of hyperlipidemias in elderly subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , 2 ) measurement of plasma glucose and insulin levels in patients with phyerlipidemias and atherosclerotic vascular disease , and 3 ) computation of correlation between levels of substances involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis ( F-VII , F-X , and P05121 ) and levels of triglycerides and insulin in serum in hyperlipidemic patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease . The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was 4 % in non-diabetic control subjects , 38 % in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance , 22 % in those with diabetes , and 29 % in those with both conditions . Levels of glucose and insulin in plasma were measured after oral intake of 75 g of glucose . The insulin response was greater in the group with hypertriglyceridemia than in the group with normal triglyceride levels , although the glucose responses did not differ between the groups . The activities and levels of F-VII , F-X , and P05121 correlated with triglycerides in serum and also with fasting insulin levels in hyperlipidemic patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease . We conclude that hypertriglyceridemia plays an important role in the development of atherothrombotic vascular disease ; it accompanies elevation of coagulation and antifibrinolytic activities in elderly patients with insulin resistance .
