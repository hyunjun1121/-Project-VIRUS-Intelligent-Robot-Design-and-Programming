In P11274 - P00519 -positive cells , P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation integrates signals induced by imatinib mesylate and DB00987 . In P11274 - P00519 -positive cells , the transcription factor P35610 -5 is constitutively activated by tyrosine phosphorylation . P35610 -5 activation results in upregulation of bcl-X(L) and increased resistance to induction of apoptosis . Here , we investigated the effects of imatinib mesylate and cytosine arabinoside ( DB00987 ) on P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation , cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells . Imatinib mesylate treatment strongly suppressed P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation in K562 and primary CML blasts . In contrast to O60674 and P19957 -kinase inhibition , exposure of K562 cells to imatinib mesylate resulted in obvious suppression of proliferation . Reduced cell growth was due to specific induction of caspase activation followed by apoptotic cell death . In addition , we investigated the effects of DB00987 on P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation . Exposure to DB00987 resulted in significant downregulation of P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation and inhibition of DNA binding . Treatment of K562 cells with DB00987 in combination with imatinib mesylate revealed synergistic effects at the level of P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation and DNA binding , Hck tyrosine-phosphorylation , cell growth and induction of apoptosis . Overall , in this report we demonstrate that P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation is a specific target of imatinib mesylate and DB00987 . Our results suggest that , in combination therapy , inhibition of P35610 -5 tyrosine-phosphorylation may be responsible for synergistic or additive effects on P11274 - P00519 -positive cells .
