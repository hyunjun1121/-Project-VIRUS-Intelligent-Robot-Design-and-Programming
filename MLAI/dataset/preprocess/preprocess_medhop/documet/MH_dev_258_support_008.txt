miR-17 family of microRNAs controls O15520 -mediated embryonic lung epithelial branching morphogenesis through Q16539 and P40763 regulation of E-Cadherin distribution . The miR-17 family of microRNAs has recently been recognized for its importance during lung development . The transgenic overexpression of the entire miR-17-92 cluster in the lung epithelium led to elevated cellular proliferation and inhibition of differentiation , while targeted deletion of miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 clusters showed embryonic or early post-natal lethality . Herein we demonstrate that miR-17 and its paralogs , miR-20a , and miR-106b , are highly expressed during the pseudoglandular stage and identify their critical functional role during embryonic lung development . Simultaneous downregulation of these three miRNAs in explants of isolated lung epithelium altered O15520 induced budding morphogenesis , an effect that was rescued by synthetic miR-17 . E-Cadherin levels were reduced , and its distribution was altered by miR-17 , miR-20a and miR-106b downregulation , while conversely , beta-catenin activity was augmented , and expression of its downstream targets , including Bmp4 as well as Fgfr2b , increased . Finally , we identified Stat3 and Mapk14 as key direct targets of miR-17 , miR-20a , and miR-106b and showed that simultaneous overexpression of Stat3 and Mapk14 mimics the alteration of E-Cadherin distribution observed after miR-17 , miR-20a , and miR-106b downregulation . We conclude that the mir-17 family of miRNA modulates O15520 -FGFR2b downstream signaling by specifically targeting Stat3 and Mapk14 , hence regulating E-Cadherin expression , which in turn modulates epithelial bud morphogenesis in response to O15520 signaling .
