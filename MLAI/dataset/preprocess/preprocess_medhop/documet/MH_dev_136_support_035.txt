Predictive factors in patients with advanced and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck : a study based on SWOG protocol S0420 . To evaluate the prognostic values of different protein expression in the progression of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) patients , we conducted immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis in tissue samples of different patients enrolled on SWOG protocol S0420 . S0420 was a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent sorafenib in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic or recurrent SCCHN . The primary end point was response probability , i.e. , confirmed complete ( CR ) and partial response ( PR ) . DB00398 was administered orally at 400 mg twice daily on a continuous basis in 28-day cycles to eligible patients . Responses were evaluated according to RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) criteria . IHC analysis was performed for various markers and data were analyzed statistically . IHC data were obtained from 19 patients enrolled on S0420 . There was a high frequency of cases with expression of the angiogenesis markers SMA , HIF-1α , P04049 , P15692 and P15692 -R . None of the markers were significantly associated with response . Negative HER-2 status was associated with longer progression-free survival ( PFS ) , P=0.04 . Negative NRP-1 status was associated with longer overall survival ( OS ) , P=0.04 . There were no other significant associations . An almost universal overexpression of angiogenesis markers in the samples analyzed supports the evaluation of angiogenesis inhibition as a potential target for therapy . High levels of NRP-1 and HER-2 in SCCHN samples appear to be associated with decreased survival and earlier progression of disease , respectively , in SCCHN patients and may represent targets for therapy .
