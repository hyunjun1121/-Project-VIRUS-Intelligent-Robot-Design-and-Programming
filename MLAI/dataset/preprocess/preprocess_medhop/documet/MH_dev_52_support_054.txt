DB08879 -- an anti- Q9Y275 human monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis . INTRODUCTION : Q9Y275 ( Q9Y275 ) is a major regulatory factor that controls the development and survival of B cells . Elevated serum levels of Q9Y275 have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . DB08879 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits Q9Y275 and it is being developed for the treatment of RA . This review aims to summarize up-to-date pharmacological and clinical data of belimumab in the treatment of RA . AREAS COVERED : A literature search was performed on PubMed using keywords , including belimumab , LymphoStat-B , benlysta , Q9Y275 inhibitor , rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disease . References of relevant studies were searched by hand . Abstracts of international conferences up to October 2012 were also included . DB08879 was well tolerated in the treatment of RA over 24 weeks . It significantly increased American College of Rheumatology ( P10323 )20 responses at week 24 , especially in patients with high disease activity , positive rheumatoid factor , no anti- P01375 treatment experience and those who had failed methotrexate therapy . However , belimumab failed to demonstrate significantly improved ACR50 and ACR70 responses in the single Phase II clinical trial of RA . EXPERT OPINION : These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of belimumab for RA needs to be further investigated in future clinical trials . Careful patient selection may be necessary for belimumab to achieve optimal clinical outcomes in RA .
