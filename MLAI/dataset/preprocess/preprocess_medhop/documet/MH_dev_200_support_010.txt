Selective elimination of a chemoresistant side population of B-CLL cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes in subjects receiving an autologous hCD40L/ P60568 tumor vaccine . Side-population ( SP ) analysis identifies precursor cells in normal and malignant tissues . Cells with this phenotype have increased resistance to many cytotoxic agents , and may represent a primary drug-resistant population in malignant diseases . To discover whether drug-resistant malignant SP cells are nonetheless sensitive to immune-mediated killing , we first established the presence of a malignant P06127 (+) P15391 (+) SP subset in the blood of 18/21 subjects with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) . We examined the fate of these cells in six of these individuals who received autologous human P29965 and interleukin-2 ( hCD40L/ P60568 ) gene-modified tumor cells as part of a tumor vaccine study . Vaccinated patients showed an increase in B-CLL-reactive T cells followed by a corresponding decline in circulating P06127 (+) P15391 (+) SP cells . T-cell lines and clones generated from vaccinated patients specifically recognized B-CLL SP tumor cells . Elimination of SP cells is likely triggered by their increased expression of target antigens , such as receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility ( O75330 ) , after stimulation of the malignant cells by hCD40L , as CD8(+) O75330 -specific T cells could be detected in the peripheral blood of immunized patients and were associated with the decline in B-CLL SP cells . Hence , malignant B cells with a primary drug-resistant phenotype can be targeted by T- cell-mediated effector activity after immunization of human subjects .
