Taming psoriatic keratinocytes -- PTHs ' uses go up another notch . The native parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) and several of its N-terminal adenylyl cyclase-activating fragments and their analogs have become the star stimulators of bone growth for treating osteoporosis , accelerating fracture healing , and strengthening the anchorage of prosthetic bone implants and one of them ( Lilly 's Forteo -- recombinant DB05829 -(1-34) has recently arrived in the clinic . But something entirely different has been lurking in the background-the ability of the adenylyl cyclase stimulating DB05829 -(1-34) to calm hyperproliferating keratinocytes and reduce psoriatic lesions . By contrast PTH-(7-34) which can not stimulate adenylyl cyclase actually stimulates keratinocyte proliferation . Normal keratinocytes make P12272 after they lift off the basal lamina and have stopped cycling . But they have an unconventional PTH/ P12272 receptor which is not coupled to adenylyl cyclase . Psoriatic keratinocytes do not make P12272 and have only a broken-down , proliferation-limiting terminal differentiation-driving Notch-Notch ligand mechanism . Putting these and other facts together produces a possible picture of an exogenously applied adenylyl cyclase-activating PTH pinch hitting for the missing P12272 and restoring normal keratinocyte proliferative activity epidermal structure by stimulating dermal fibroblasts which do have the conventional adenylyl cyclase-linked Q03431 and in response directly or indirectly restore the overlying basal keratinocytes ' Notch-Notch ligand terminal differentiation-driving mechanism and consequently a normal epidermal structure .
