Regulation of hepatic ApoC3 expression by P20142 -1β mediates hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( Q07869 ) γ coactivator-1β ( P20142 -1β ) is a transcriptional coactivator that induces hypertriglyceridemia in response to dietary fats through activating hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion . The expression of P20142 -1β is regulated by free fatty acids . Here we show that P20142 -1β regulates plasma triglyceride metabolism through stimulating apolipoprotein P01024 ( P02656 ) expression and elevating P02656 levels in circulation . Remarkably , liver-specific knockdown of P02656 significantly ameliorates P20142 -1β-induced hypertriglyceridemia in mice . Hepatic expression of P20142 -1β and P02656 is reduced in response to acute and chronic treatments with nicotinic acid , a widely prescribed drug for lowering plasma triglycerides . Adenoviral-mediated knockdown of P20142 -1β or P02656 in the liver recapitulates the hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid . Proteomic analysis of hepatic P20142 -1β transcriptional complex indicates that it stimulates P02656 expression through coactivating orphan nuclear receptor ERRα and recruiting chromatin-remodeling cofactors . Together , these studies identify P20142 -1β as an important regulator of the P02656 gene cluster and reveal a mechanism through which nicotinic acid achieves its therapeutic effects .
