Vampire bat plasminogen activator DB04925 -alpha-1 ( desmoteplase ) : a thrombolytic drug optimized by natural selection . P00747 activators are enzymes found in all vertebrate species investigated so far . Their physiological function is the generation of localized proteolysis in the context of tissue remodeling , wound healing and neuronal plasticity . The common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) is a New World species that feeds exclusively on blood . Its saliva contains highly potent plasminogen activators , specialized in rapid lysis of fresh blood clots . Biochemical and pharmacological evidence indicates that these plasminogen activators represent a new class of thrombolytics with pharmacological and toxicological properties superior to human tissue-type plasminogen activator , the clot dissolving agent now most frequently used in medicine . A form of the enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology is currently employed to test this hypothesis in clinical studies .
