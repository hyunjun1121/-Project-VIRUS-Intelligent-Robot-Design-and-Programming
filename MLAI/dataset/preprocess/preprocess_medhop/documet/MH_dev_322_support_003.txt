DB00472 pharmacogenetics in child and adult populations . Although fluoxetine is useful in the treatment of major depression , 30-40 % of the patients do not respond to therapy . The response seems to be influenced by certain genes which are involved in the drug 's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics . The present study reviews the literature on genetic contributions to fluoxetine response in children and adults , and concludes that the different polymorphisms of P10635 and P11712 may influence the blood concentrations of fluoxetine . If the childhood dose is adjusted for weight , differences between children and adults are unlikely . As regards the genes that influence the drug 's pharmacodynamics , polymorphisms of P31645 , P08908 and P21397 seem to be involved in the response to fluoxetine , while the genes P21964 , P34998 , PDEA1 , PDEA11 P49841 and serpin-1 also seem to play a role . Comparison of different studies reveals that the results are not always consistent , probably due to methodological differences . Other factors such as gender or ethnicity may also influence treatment response .
