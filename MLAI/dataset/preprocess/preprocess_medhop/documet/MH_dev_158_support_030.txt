Novel roles of Akt and P42345 in suppressing TGF-beta/ P36897 -mediated P84022 activation . P01308 -like growth factor-I inhibits transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling by blocking activation of P84022 ( S3 ) , via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt-dependent pathway . Here we provide the first report that the kinase activity of Akt is necessary for its ability to suppress many TGF-beta responses , including S3 activation and induction of apoptosis . Wild-type and myristoylated Akts ( Akt(WT) and Akt(Myr) ) suppress TGF-beta-induced phospho-activation of S3 but not Q15796 ( S2 ) , whereas kinase-dead Akt1 ( Akt1K179M ) or dominant-negative PI3K enhances TGF-beta-induced phospho-activation of both S2 and S3 . Using siRNA , rapamycin ( Rap ) , and adenoviral expression for P62942 -resistant and constitutively active P36897 ( P36897 ) , we demonstrate that mammalian target of Rap ( P42345 ) mediates Akt1 suppression of phospho-activation of S3 . These and further data on Akt1-S3 binding do not support a recently proposed model that Akt blocks S3 activation through physical interaction and sequestration of S3 from TGF-beta receptors . We propose a novel model whereby Akt suppresses activation of S3 in an Akt kinase-dependent manner through P42345 , a likely route for loss of tumor suppression by TGF-beta in cancers .
