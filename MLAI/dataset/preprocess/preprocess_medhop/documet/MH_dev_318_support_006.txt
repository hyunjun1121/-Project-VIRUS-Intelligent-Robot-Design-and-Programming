DB06288 is a potent P34969 antagonist : relevance for antidepressant actions in vivo . RATIONALE : DB06288 is approved for clinical use in treating schizophrenia in a number of European countries and also for treating dysthymia , a mild form of depression , in Italy . DB06288 has also been demonstrated to be an antidepressant for patients with major depression in many clinical trials . In part because of the selective D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist properties of amisulpride , it has long been widely assumed that dopaminergic modulation is the proximal event responsible for mediating its antidepressant and antipsychotic properties . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of these studies was to determine if amisulpride 's antidepressant actions are mediated by off-target interactions with other receptors . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We performed experiments that : ( 1 ) examined the pharmacological profile of amisulpride at a large number of central nervous system ( CNS ) molecular targets and , ( 2 ) after finding high potency antagonist affinity for human 5-HT(7a) serotonin receptors , characterized the actions of amisulpride as an antidepressant in wild-type and 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice . RESULTS : We discovered that amisulpride was a potent competitive antagonist at 5-HT(7a) receptors and that interactions with no other molecular target investigated in this paper could explain its antidepressant actions in vivo . Significantly , and in contrast to their wild-type littermates , 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice did not respond to amisulpride in two widely used rodent models of depression , the tail suspension test and the forced swim test . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that 5-HT(7a) receptor antagonism , and not D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonism , likely underlies the antidepressant actions of amisulpride .
