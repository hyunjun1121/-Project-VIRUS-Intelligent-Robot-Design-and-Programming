Novel function of androgen receptor-associated protein 55/ O43294 as a negative regulator of P84022 signaling . P10275 -associated protein 55 ( O43294 / O43294 ) belongs to the LIM protein superfamily and is featured by three or four N-terminal LD motifs and four C-terminal zinc finger-like LIM domains . Both LD motifs and LIM domains can serve as protein-protein interaction interfaces . Recently , we found that enforced expression of O43294 inhibits transforming growth factor-beta-mediated up-regulation of Smad binding element-luciferase reporter activity in NRP-154 and NRP-152 rat prostate and LNCaP human prostate cell lines . Moreover , O43294 also inhibits the induction of Smad-binding element 4-luciferase and 3TP-luciferase ( a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( P05121 ) promoter construct ) reporters by constitutively active ( CA ) - P84022 in these cell lines . Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest an interaction between O43294 and either CA- P84022 or wild-type P84022 in HEK293 cells that occurs through the MH2 domain of P84022 and the C terminus of O43294 with wild-type P84022 having stronger affinity than CA- P84022 to O43294 . O60760 pull-down assays demonstrate that this interaction can occur in a cell-free system . These results are consistent with the luciferase data showing that the C terminus of O43294 is critical for suppression of P84022 activity . Furthermore , using a mammalian two-hybrid system , we confirmed that O43294 interacts with the MH2 domain of P84022 and suppresses CA- P84022 -induced transcriptional responses . In conclusion , these results support that O43294 selectively intercepts transforming growth factor-beta signaling through an interaction of the LIM domain of O43294 with the MH2 domain of P84022 .
