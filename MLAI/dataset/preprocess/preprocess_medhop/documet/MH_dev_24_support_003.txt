Anandamide regulates the expression of GnRH1 , GnRH2 , and DB00644 -Rs in frog testis . DB00644 ( either GnRH1 or GnRH2 ) exerts a local activity in vertebrate testis , including human testis . Relationships between endocannabinoid ( eCB ) and DB00644 systems in gonads have never been elucidated in any species so far . To reveal a cross-talk between eCBs and DB00644 at testicular level , we characterized the expression of DB00644 ( GnRH1 and GnRH2 ) as well as P30968 ( DB00644 - Q96GN5 , -R2 , and -R3 ) mRNA in the testis of the anuran amphibian Rana esculenta during the annual sexual cycle ; furthermore , the corresponding transcripts were localized inside the testis by in situ hybridization . The possible endogenous production of the eCB , anandamide ( AEA ) , was investigated in testis by analyzing the expression of its biosynthetic enzyme , Nape-pld . Incubations of testis pieces with AEA were carried out in the postreproductive period ( June ) and in February , when a new spermatogenetic wave takes place . In June , AEA treatment significantly decreased GnRH1 and DB00644 -R2 mRNA , stimulated the transcription of GnRH2 and DB00644 - Q96GN5 , and did not affect DB00644 -R3 expression . In February , AEA treatment upregulated GnRH2 and DB00644 -R3 mRNA , downregulated DB00644 -R2 , and did not affect GnRH1 and DB00644 - Q96GN5 expression . These effects were mediated by type 1 cannabinoid receptor ( P21554 ) since they were fully counteracted by SR141716A ( DB06155 ) , a selective P21554 antagonist . In conclusion , eCB system modulates DB00644 activity in frog testis during the annual sexual cycle in a stage-dependent fashion .
