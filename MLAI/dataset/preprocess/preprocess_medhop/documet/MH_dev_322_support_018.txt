Pathogenesis of spinally mediated hyperalgesia in diabetes . Hyperalgesia to noxious stimuli is accompanied by increased spinal cyclooxygenase ( P36551 ) -2 protein in diabetic rats . The present studies were initiated to establish causality between increased spinal P35354 activity and hyperalgesia during diabetes and to assess the potential involvement of polyol pathway activity in the pathogenesis of spinally mediated hyperalgesia . Rats with 1 , 2 , or 4 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes exhibited significantly increased levels of spinal P35354 protein and activity , along with exaggerated paw flinching in response to 0.5 % paw formalin injection . Increased flinching of diabetic rats was attenuated by intrathecal pretreatment with a selective P35354 inhibitor immediately before formalin injection , confirming the involvement of P35354 activity in diabetic hyperalgesia . Chronic treatment with insulin or ICI222155 , an aldose reductase inhibitor ( Q9Y4X5 ) previously shown to prevent spinal polyol accumulation and formalin-evoked hyperalgesia in diabetic rats , prevented elevated spinal P35354 protein and activity in diabetic rats . In contrast , the Q9Y4X5 IDD676 had no effect on spinal polyol accumulation , elevated spinal P35354 , or hyperalgesia to paw formalin injection . In the spinal cord , aldose reductase immunoreactivity was present solely in oligodendrocytes , which also contained P35354 immunoreactivity . Polyol pathway flux in spinal oligodendrocytes provides a pathogenic mechanism linking hyperglycemia to hyperalgesia in diabetic rats .
