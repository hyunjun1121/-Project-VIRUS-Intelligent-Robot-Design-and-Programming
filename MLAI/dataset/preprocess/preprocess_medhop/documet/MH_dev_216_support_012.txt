Regulation of apoptosis by tyrosine-containing domains of IL-4R alpha : Y497 and Y713 , but not the P42226 -docking tyrosines , signal protection from apoptosis . P05112 is a cytokine with important antiapoptotic activity . We have analyzed the role that tyrosine-containing domains within the cytoplasmic tail of IL-4R alpha play in P05112 -mediated protection from apoptosis . 32D cells expressing a wt huIL-4R alpha or one truncated at aa 557 were protected by huIL-4 from apoptosis while cells expressing a receptor truncated at aa 657 were not , suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal domain signals protection from apoptosis . However , changing Y713 within this region to phenylalanine had no effect . To analyze the contribution of tyrosine-containing domains independently , we transplanted regions of the huIL-4R alpha to a truncated form of the huIL-2R beta that could not signal protection from apoptosis . Transplantation of the huIL-4R alpha domains containing Y497 or Y713 partially prevented cell death and together signaled protection from apoptosis in response to P60568 as well as the wt IL-2R beta . Mutation of Y497 and Y713 to phenylalanine inhibited protection . In contrast , transplantation of the domain containing the potential P42226 -docking tyrosines alone had no effect , yet it inhibited the protection mediated by the other domains . Although IL-4R alpha signals Shc and SH2-containing inositol phosphatase ( Q92835 ) phosphorylation , we could not establish an association between their activation and protection from apoptosis . Taken together , this study suggests that the domains of the huIL-4R alpha containing Y497 and Y713 positively regulate protection from apoptosis while the domain containing the P42226 docking sites suppresses this protection , and that additional signaling molecules other than insulin receptor substrate-1 ( P35568 ) , Shc , or Q92835 may be involved in antiapoptotic signaling .
