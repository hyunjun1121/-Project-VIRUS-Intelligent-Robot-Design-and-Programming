Translational research in bipolar disorder : emerging insights from genetically based models . Bipolar disorder ( BPD ) is characterized by vulnerability to episodic depression and mania and spontaneous cycling . Because of marked advances in candidate-gene and genome-wide association studies , the list of risk genes for BPD is growing rapidly , creating an unprecedented opportunity to understand the pathophysiology of BPD and to develop novel therapeutics for its treatment . However , genetic findings are associated with major unresolved issues , including whether and how risk variance leads to behavioral abnormalities . Although animal studies are key to resolving these issues , consensus is needed regarding how to define and monitor phenotypes related to mania , depression and mood swing vulnerability in genetically manipulated rodents . In this study we discuss multiple facets of this challenging area , including theoretical considerations , available tests , limitations associated with rodent behavioral modeling and promising molecular-behavioral findings . These include O15516 , glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , glutamate receptor 6 ( Q13002 ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 ( P27361 ) , p11 ( or P60903 ) , vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( Q05940 or Q05940 ) , glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs ) , Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 ( Q99933 ) and mitochondrial DNA polymerase-gamma ( P54098 ) . Some mutant rodent strains show behavioral clusters or activity patterns that cross-species phenocopy objective/observable facets of mood syndromes , and changes in these clustered behaviors can be used as outcome measures in genetic-behavioral research in BPD .
