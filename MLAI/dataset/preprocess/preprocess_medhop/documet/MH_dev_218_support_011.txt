Identification of cell surface targets for HIV-1 therapeutics using genetic screens . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) drugs designed to interfere with obligatory utilization of certain host cell factors by virus are less likely to encounter development of resistant strains than drugs directed against viral components . Several cellular genes required for productive infection by HIV were identified by the use of genetic suppressor element ( GSE ) technology as potential targets for anti-HIV drug development . Fragmented cDNA libraries from various pools of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were expressed in vitro in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) -susceptible cell lines and subjected to genetic screens to identify GSEs that interfered with viral replication . After three rounds of selection , more than 15000 GSEs were sequenced , and the cognate genes were identified . The GSEs that inhibited the virus were derived from a diverse set of genes including cell surface receptors , cytokines , signaling proteins , transcription factors , as well as genes with unknown function . Approximately 2.5 % of the identified genes were previously shown to play a role in the HIV-1 life cycle ; this finding supports the biological relevance of the assay . GSEs were derived from the following 12 cell surface proteins : P61073 , CCR4 , P32248 , P20702 , P16070 , Q08722 , P34810 , Q07108 , P04233 , Q99062 , Q9UBS5 , and P20333 . Requirement of some of these genes for viral infection was also investigated by using RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology ; accordingly , 10 genes were implicated in early events of the viral life cycle , before viral DNA synthesis . Thus , these cell surface proteins represent novel targets for the development of therapeutics against HIV-1 infection and AIDS .
