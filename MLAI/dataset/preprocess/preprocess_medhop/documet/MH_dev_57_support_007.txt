Bile acid-induced negative feedback regulation of the human ileal bile acid transporter . Ileal expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ( Q12908 ) in the rat is unaffected by bile salts , yet in the mouse it is under negative-feedback regulation . The bile acid responsiveness of human Q12908 is unknown . The human Q12908 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter was studied in Caco-2 cells treated with chenodeoxycholic acid ( DB06777 ) and transfected with expression plasmids for farnesoid Q9UBH6 ( Q96RI1 ) , short heterodimer partner ( Q15466 ) , and retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor ( RAR/RXR ) . DB06777 treatment of Caco-2 cells led to a 75 % reduction in steady-state Q12908 messenger RNA levels and a 78 % reduction in human Q12908 promoter activity . A dominant negative Q96RI1 abrogated the response to DB06777 . Site-directed mutagenesis of an RAR/RXR cis element in the human Q12908 promoter reduced its activity by 50 % and eliminated the bile acid response . Retinoic acid activated the human Q12908 promoter fourfold . Q15466 repressed the activity of the Q12908 promoter and reduced activation by retinoic acid . Antisense mediated knock-down of Q15466 in Caco-2 cells partially offset the bile acid mediated repression of Q12908 promoter activity . In conclusion , the human Q12908 is positively regulated by retinoic acid . Bile acids induce a negative feedback regulation of human Q12908 via an Q96RI1 -mediated , Q15466 -dependent effect upon RAR/RXR activation of Q12908 .
