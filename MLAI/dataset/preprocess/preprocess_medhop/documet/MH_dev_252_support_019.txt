The role of the central flexible region on the aggregation and conformational properties of human ataxin-3 . Aggregation of human ataxin-3 ( P01008 ) into amyloid fibrils is responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 . This protein consists of a folded N-terminal domain ( Josephin domain , residues 1-182 ) , a central flexible region ( residues 183-291 ) , a poly-glutamine sequence of variable length and a short C-terminal flexible region . Very little is known about the influence of the central flexible region on the conformational and aggregation properties of this protein . The present study aimed to investigate the specific role of this portion of the protein ( residues 183-291 ) . Accordingly , protein fragments 1-182 ( P01008 /182 ) and 1-291 ( P01008 /291 ) were produced and compared by thioflavin-T fluorescence , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , CD , intrinsic fluorescence and P19957 -MS . It is shown that the central flexible region enhances protein aggregation and can populate conformational states with different degrees of compactness . Both monomeric and dimeric partially-folded forms are identified for both protein fragments under denaturing conditions . Partially-folded monomers and dimers accumulate to a larger extent in P01008 /291 . These species represent good candidates for early intermediates of the aggregation process under the experimental conditions employed in the present study .
