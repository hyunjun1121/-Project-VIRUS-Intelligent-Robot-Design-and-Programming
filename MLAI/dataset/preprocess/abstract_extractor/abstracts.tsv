17284678	Eimeria tenella is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects the intestinal tracts of domestic fowl and causes coccidiosis, a serious and sometimes lethal enteritis. Eimeria falls in the same phylum (Apicomplexa) as several human and animal parasites such as Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and the malaria parasite, Plasmodium. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the first chromosome of E. tenella, a chromosome believed to carry loci associated with drug resistance and known to differ between virulent and attenuated strains of the parasite. The chromosome--which appears to be representative of the genome--is gene-dense and rich in simple-sequence repeats, many of which appear to give rise to repetitive amino acid tracts in the predicted proteins. Most striking is the segmentation of the chromosome into repeat-rich regions peppered with transposon-like elements and telomere-like repeats, alternating with repeat-free regions. Predicted genes differ in character between the two types of segment, and the repeat-rich regions appear to be associated with strain-to-strain variation.
15531828	To study the occurrence of nosocomial diarrhea in pediatric wards and the role of infections in its causation. 75 cases conforming to the CDC definition of nosocomial diarrhea were selected for the study. Stool samples were subjected to direct microscopic examination, bacteriological culture and direct antigen detection for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and Rota virus. All the cases were sporadic in origin. Rota virus was detected in 16.67% cases and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E.P.E.C.) was detected in 12% cases. Cases in which no pathogen was detected (82.7%) outnumbered those in which a pathogen was identified (17.3%). Rota virus and E.P.E.C were the most common etiological agents. C. difficile was detected in one case only. Most of the sporadic cases of nosocomial diarrhea in pediatric patients can be managed on fluids and electrolytes.
11791095	Based on single case reports, parvovirus B19 (B19) has repeatedly been proposed as an etiologic agent in patients with Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP), perhaps causing vasculitis by direct invasion of vascular endothelial cells because of the tissue distribution of the cellular B19 receptor. A cohort of children with HSP and other vasculitic diseases was investigated and compared with healthy control children to assess the role of B19 as well as parvovirus V9 (a putative emerging B19-like virus). Serum samples from 36 children with HSP (n = 29) or other vasculitic diseases (n = 7) were examined, and 38 healthy bone marrow donors were used as controls. The presence of specific B19 and V9 IgM and IgG antibodies was determined with a recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and viral DNA was detected by a novel nested PCR. Specific IgM was not present in any of the patient or control serum samples. B19 DNA was detected in one patient, a previously healthy 8-year-old boy diagnosed with HSP, whereas none of the controls was B19-positive. V9 was not detected in any of the clinical or control samples. It seems likely that B19 infection might have triggered the development of HSP in the B19-positive patient, because B19 viremia is otherwise uncommon. Although causality is difficult to construe in single cases, the data indicate that B19 is not a common contributing factor in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and that this pathogen is only rarely associated temporally with HSP or vasculitic diseases in children.
10708056	The effects of chemokine and chemokine receptor genetic polymorphisms such as stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1-3'A), CCR2-64I, and CCR5-delta32 associated with HIV-1 transmission and/or rate of disease progression in infected study subjects remain highly controversial and have been analyzed primarily only in adults. We have investigated whether these polymorphisms may provide similar beneficial effects in children exposed to HIV-1 perinatally. The prevalence of CCR2-64I allele was significantly increased (p = .03) and the CCR2-64I genotype distribution was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, among HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants. Moreover, in the HIV-1-infected group, a delay to AIDS progression was observed among carriers of CCR2-64I allele. This is the first report that suggests a protective role of CCR2-64I allele in mother-to-infant HIV-1 transmission and documents a delay in disease progression, after the child has been infected with HIV-1. However, SDFI-3'A and CCR5-delta32 alleles did not modify the rate of HIV-1 transmission or disease progression in HIV-1-infected children.
