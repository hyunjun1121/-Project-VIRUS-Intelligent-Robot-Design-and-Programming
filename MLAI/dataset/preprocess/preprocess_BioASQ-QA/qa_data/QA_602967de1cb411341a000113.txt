QUESTION: How many nucleotides long is the HOTAIR CNE?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The HOTAIR CNE is a 32-nucleotide long conserved noncoding element
- HOTAIR was proposed to regulate either HoxD cluster genes in trans or HoxC cluster genes in cis, a mechanism that remains unclear. A 32-nucleotide conserved noncoding element (CNE) was identified as HOTAIR ancient sequence that likely originated at the root of vertebrate.
- The HOTAIR element is a 32-nucleotide conserved noncoding element

EXACT_ANSWER:
- 32
