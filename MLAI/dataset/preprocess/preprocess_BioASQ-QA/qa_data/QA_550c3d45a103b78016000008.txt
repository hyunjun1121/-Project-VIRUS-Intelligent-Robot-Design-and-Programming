- The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein.
- Parkinson s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Majority of PD are sporadic, for which genetic causes remain largely unknown. Alpha-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, plays a central role in the PD pathogenesis  

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Alpha-synuclein
