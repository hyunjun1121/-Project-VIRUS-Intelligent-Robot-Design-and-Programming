QUESTION: What is the incubation period for COVID-19?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- For COVID-19, the mean incubation period was 6.0 days globally but near 7.0 days in the mainland of China, which will help identify the time of infection and make disease control decisions. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain.
- The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring approximately five to seven days after exposure. The incubation period also varies by viral variant. For example, the incubation period for the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) appears to be slightly shorter, with symptoms first appearing around four days after exposure.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- 5-7 days
- 5 days
- 6 days
- 7 days
