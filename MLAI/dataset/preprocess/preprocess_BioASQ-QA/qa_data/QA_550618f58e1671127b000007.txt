QUESTION: Which protein is the main inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Inhibitor 1 (I-1) is a protein inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major eukaryotic Ser/Thr phosphatase. Nonphosphorylated I-1 is inactive, whereas phosphorylated I-1 is a potent PP1 inhibitor.   
- Protein Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). Inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1, by inhibitor-1, significantly increases cardiac contractility and calcium handling. Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- protein phosphatase inhibitor 1
- inhibitor 1
- PPI-1
- I1
