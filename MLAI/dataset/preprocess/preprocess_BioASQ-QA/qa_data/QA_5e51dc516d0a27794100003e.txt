QUESTION: Which is the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in Europeans?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Loss-of-function nuclear factor kB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans.
- Heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells
