IDEAL_ANSWER:
- About 3% of human genes have no introns.  URL_0
- Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome. Intronless genes (IGs) fraction varies between 2.7 and 97.7% in eukaryotic genomes.
- 3 percent of the human genome
- Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome.
- Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome. Intronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function.
