QUESTION: What receptor is associated with the protein encoded by the Sp√§tzle gene?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Currently, as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor, only Spatzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized.
- Currently Spatzle (Spz) has been identified and characterized as a ligand for the Toll-1 receptor
- Spatzle (Spz) is the toll-1 receptor gene encoding a protein subunit of a multisubunit membrane protein complex that plays a central role in the remodeling of the cytoskeleton and its association with the membrane.
- The  Drosophila  Toll-1 receptor is involved in embryonic development, innate immunity, and tissue homeostasis. Currently, as a ligand for the  Toll-1 receptor, only  Spatzle ( Spz) has been identified and characterized.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Toll-1 receptor
