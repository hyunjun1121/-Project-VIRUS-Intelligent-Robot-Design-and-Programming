QUESTION: Which R/bioconductor package utilizes the Hilbert curve in order to visualize genomic data?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The so-called Hilbert curve visualization can complement genome browsers and help to get further insights into the structure of one's data. An open-source application, called HilbertVis, has been developed for R/bioconductor that allows the user to produce and interactively explore such plots.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- HilbertVis
