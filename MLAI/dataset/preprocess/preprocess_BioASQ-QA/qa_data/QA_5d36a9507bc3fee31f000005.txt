QUESTION: Which cells mature in the human thymus?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Thymus progenitor cells mature in the human thymus through differentiation into cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts.
- Late stages of T cell maturation in the thymus involve NF-kB and tonic type I interferon signaling. NF-kB and tonic interferon signals are involved in the final maturation of thymocytes into naive T cells.

- NF-kB and tonic interferon signals are involved in the final maturation of thymocytes into naive T cells.
- The mammalian thymus is an important post-translational organ that plays a pivotal role in the development of the human immune system. Thymocytes, which represent 50% of the cells in the human body, mature into cardiomyocytes and T cells.
- T cells mature in the human thymus; in particular, type T cells.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- T-cells
- T-lymphocytes
