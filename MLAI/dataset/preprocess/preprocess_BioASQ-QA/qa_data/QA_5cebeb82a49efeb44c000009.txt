QUESTION: What is the genetic basis for Cornelia de Lange's syndrome?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Mutations in five genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8), all regulators or structural components of cohesin, have been identified.
- Approximately 60% of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) cases are due to NIPBL mutations, 5% caused by mutations in SMC1A, RAD21, and HDAC8 and one proband was found to carry a mutation in SMC3. Mutations in five genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8), all regulators or structural components of cohesin, have been identified.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Mutations in genes that are associated with cohesin
