QUESTION: Which calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase is involved in the activation of the family of NFAT transcription factors (Nuclear Factors of Activated T cells)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN).Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Calcineurin
- CaN
- phosphatase 2b
