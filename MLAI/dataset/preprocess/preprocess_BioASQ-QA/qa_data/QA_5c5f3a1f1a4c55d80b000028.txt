QUESTION: What is the role of fucokinase?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- FUK encodes fucokinase, the only enzyme capable of converting L-fucose to fucose-1-phosphate, which will ultimately be used for synthesizing GDP-fucose, the donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- The convertion of L-fucose to fucose-1-phosphate.
