QUESTION: Which  is the execution time (complexity) of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for the alignment of two sequences

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The complexity of the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm is quadratic,  that is, it runs in time proportional to the product of lengths of the sequences being aligned.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- quadratic
