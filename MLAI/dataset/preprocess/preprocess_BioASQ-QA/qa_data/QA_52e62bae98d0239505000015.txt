QUESTION: What is the life expectancy of professional athletes in respect to the general population?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Elite endurance (aerobic) athletes and mixed-sports (aerobic and anaerobic) athletes show higher longevity than the general population, but results  about power (anaerobic) athletes are inconsistent.
- It remains unclear if high-intensity sports activities further increase life expectancy.
Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy
It appears that elite endurance (aerobic) athletes and mixed-sports (aerobic and anaerobic) athletes survive longer than the general population, as indicated by lower mortality and higher longevity.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- longer than the general population
- No clear results indicating improved life expectancy in professional athletes
