QUESTION: Which subcortical brain structure is influenced the most by common genetic variants?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. Five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus were identified. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue.
- Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures. The strongest effects are found for the putamen and caudate nucleus, where a novel intergenic locus with replicative influence on volume and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohort.
- Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures. The strongest effects are found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945330; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained. In caudate nucleus scientists have identified five novel genetic variants influenced the volumes of putamen and caudated nucleus.
- The putamen is the most affected by common genetic variants. It is the subcortical brain structure responsible for learning, memory and motivation.
- The putamen is the most influenced by common genetic variants. It is the subcortical brain structure responsible for learning, memory and motivation.
- Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures. The strongest effects are found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945280; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of theKTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants affecting putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport.
- The putamen is the most influenced by common genetic variants. It is the subcortical brain structure responsible for learning and memory consolidation.
