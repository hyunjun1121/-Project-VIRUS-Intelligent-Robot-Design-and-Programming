QUESTION: What cellular process is the protein clathrin involved in?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Clathrin is a central regulator of endocytosis in all eukaryotes that plays a role in bacterial and plastid differentiation
- Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes). while clathrin mediated endocytosis w
- Clathrin is a central regulator of endocytosis in all eukaryotes that plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis
- while clathrin mediated endocytosis w. Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes).
- Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes)
- Clathrin plays a critical role in endocytosis and in doing so is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis
- Receptor-mediated endocytosis proceeds by transfer of receptor-ligand complexes from clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface to uncoated endocytic vesicles termed receptosomes (or endosomes).
- Clathrin plays a critical role in endocytosis and in many other cellular processes

EXACT_ANSWER:
- receptor mediated endocytosis
