QUESTION: Do origins of replication close to yeast centromeres fire early or late?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome.
- In yeast each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome.
- Epigenetically-inherited centromere and neocentromere DNA replicates earliest in S-phase we discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. 

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Early
