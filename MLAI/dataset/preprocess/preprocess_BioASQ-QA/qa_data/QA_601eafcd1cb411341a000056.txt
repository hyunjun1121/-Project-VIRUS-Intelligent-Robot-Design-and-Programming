QUESTION: Which deep learning framework has been developed for cancer molecular subtype classification?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity. Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. DeepCC is a novel deep learning-based framework for cancer molecular subtype classification. It is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.
- DeepCC is a novel deep learning-based framework for cancer molecular subtype classification. It is based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
