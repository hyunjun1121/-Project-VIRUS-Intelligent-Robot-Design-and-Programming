QUESTION: What percent of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients are not responding to anti-TNF therapy?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- These therapies are, however, expensive and 30% of patients fail to respond.
- Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents have revolutionized the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These therapies are, however, expensive and 30% of patients fail to respond. After 6 months, 18% had a good EULAR response, of whom 9% were considered to be in remission and 50% had a moderate response.
- Despite this, a substantial proportion of patients (approximately 30-40%) fail to respond to these potentially toxic and expensive therapies.  Treatment strategies blocking tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) have proven very successful in patients with RA, showing beneficial effects in approximately 25% of the patients.
- Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents have revolutionized the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These therapies are, however, expensive and 30% of patients fail to respond. By contrast, those patients who had failed to respond to 2 or more anti-TNF agents had a 72.5% lower probability of achieving a moderate to good EULAR response.
