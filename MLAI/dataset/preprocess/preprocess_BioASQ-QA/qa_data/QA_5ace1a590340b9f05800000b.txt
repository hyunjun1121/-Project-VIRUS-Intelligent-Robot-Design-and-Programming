QUESTION: What percentage of Homo sapiens DNA is of Neanderthal origin?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- We find that the power to reject ancient admixture might be particularly low if the population size of Homo sapiens was comparable to the Neanderthal population size. Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe.
- Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe.
- Our results indicate that 3.6% of the Neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4% of the average European gene pool, which clinally diminishes with distance from Europe. Here, we present evidence of Neanderthal introgression within the chromosome 3p21.31 region, occurring with a high frequency in East Asians (ranging from 49.4% to 66.5%) and at a low frequency in Europeans.
- 3.6 % of the neanderthal genome is shared with roughly 65.4 % of the average european gene pool , which clinally diminishes with distance from europe.This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- 2-4%
