QUESTION: Which cytokine molecule activates SMADs?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- SMADs are activated by Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)
- smads are activated by transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β).
- SMADs are activated by Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
- TGF-β1 effects appear to be mediated through the canonical Smad pathway.
- SMADs are activated by Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta).
- In an NEC animal model, oral administration of the isoform TGF-β1 activated the downstream effector Smad2 in intestine and significantly reduced NEC incidence Transcription factor specificity protein 1 modulates TGFβ1/Smad signaling to negatively regulate SIGIRR expression by human M1 macrophages stimulated with substance P.
- The protein expression of TGF‑β1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting regulates the ERK/MAPK pathway independent of the SMAD pathway
- Activated SMADs are phosphorylated by TGF-β superfamily type I receptors at two serine residues at an S-M/V-S motif at their extreme C-terminus. Once phosphorylated, activated R-SMADs form complexes with SMAD4, which accumulate in the nucleus where they activate or repress transcription.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- TGFbeta
- TGFβ
