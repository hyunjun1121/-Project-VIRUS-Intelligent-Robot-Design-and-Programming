QUESTION: Where is the histone variant CENPA preferentially localized?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Centromere protein A (Cenpa for mouse, CENP-A for other species) is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes, where it replaces conventional histone H3 and together with centromere-specific-DNA-binding factors directs the assembly of active kinetochores.
- THe histone variant CENPA is preferentially located at Centromeric chromatin

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Centromeres
- CENPA is preferentially localized in eukaryotic centromeres
