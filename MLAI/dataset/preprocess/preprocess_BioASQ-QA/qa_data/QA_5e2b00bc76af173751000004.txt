QUESTION: Which tool exist for predicting drug synergy with deep learning?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. DeepSynergy has been developed as a tool that uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies.
- DeepSynergy is an online tool for predicting drug synergy with deep learning. It is a method for predicting anti-cancer drug synergy based on a semi-supervised learning algorithm that is trained on a corpus of k-nearest neighbor data and combines pharmacological, structural and pharmacological features extracted from a large variety of biological datasets.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- DeepSynergy
