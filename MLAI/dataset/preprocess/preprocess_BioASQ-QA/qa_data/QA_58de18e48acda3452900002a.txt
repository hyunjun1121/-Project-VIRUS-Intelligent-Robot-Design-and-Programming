QUESTION: Which miRNA is targeted by SRY/Sox9?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon
- Does the linear Sry transcript function as a ceRNA for miR-138?. Recently, the sex determining region Y ( Sry) and the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 ( CDR1as) RNA transcripts have been described to function as a new class of post-transcriptional regulatory RNAs that behave as circular endogenous RNA sponges for the micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-138 and miR-7, respectively. it is reasonable to think that the linear Sry sense transcript could additionally act as a miRNA sponge, or as an endogenous competing RNA for miR-138. Results indicated that miR-138 directly targeted SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and overexpression of SOX4 and HIF-1 effectively reversed the miR-138-mediated suppression of cell invasion. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon.

Metastasis is the major factor affecting patient survival in ovarian cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated regions of messenger RNAs.
- Results indicated that miR-138 directly targeted SRY-related high mobility group box 4 (SOX4) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±), and overexpression of SOX4 and HIF-1Î± effectively reversed the miR-138-mediated suppression of cell invasion.
