QUESTION: What is the methyl donor of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet, SAM) is the methyl donor of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases. DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the C-5 position of cytosine residues in DNA.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- S-adenosyl-L-methionine
