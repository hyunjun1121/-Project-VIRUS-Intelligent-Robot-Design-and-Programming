QUESTION: Under which environment does SELANSI run?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- SELANSI (SEmi-LAgrangian SImulation of GRNs) is a software toolbox for the simulation of stochastic multidimensional gene regulatory networks. SELANSI exploits intrinsic structural properties of gene regulatory networks to accurately approximate the corresponding Chemical Master Equation with a partial integral differential equation that is solved by a semi-lagrangian method with high efficiency. SELANSI runs under the MATLAB environment, and is available under GPLv3 license at https://sites.google.com/view/selansi.
- matlab environment

EXACT_ANSWER:
- MATLAB
