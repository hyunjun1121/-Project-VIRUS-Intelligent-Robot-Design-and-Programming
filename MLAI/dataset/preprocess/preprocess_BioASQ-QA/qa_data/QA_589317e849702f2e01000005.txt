QUESTION: Which server is used for generating modes of pseudo components of DNA, RNA and protein sequences?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Pse-in-One is a web server for generating various modes of pseudo components of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. It can, through its 28 different modes, generate nearly all the possible feature vectors for DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Particularly, it can also generate those feature vectors with the properties defined by users themselves. These feature vectors can be easily combined with machine-learning algorithms to develop computational predictors and analysis methods for various tasks in bioinformatics and system biology.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Pse-in-One
