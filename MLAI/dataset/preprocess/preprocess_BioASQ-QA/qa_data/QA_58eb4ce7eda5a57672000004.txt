QUESTION: Which cellular function is associated with transcription factors forkhead 1 and 2 (Fkh1 and Fkh2)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Forkhead transcription factors establish origin timing and long-range clustering in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories.

Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. Here we describe the remaining two genes, fhl1 and fkh2, that code for proteins containing fork-head-associated domains (FHA) besides their FKHs. This may reflect a general feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes.
