QUESTION: Are most driver gene mutations synonymous or non-synonymous?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency.
