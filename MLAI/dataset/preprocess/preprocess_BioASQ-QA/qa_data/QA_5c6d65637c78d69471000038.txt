QUESTION: Which tool has been developed for visualization of non-covalent contacts?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Visualizations of biomolecular structures empower us to gain insights into biological functions, generate testable hypotheses, and communicate biological concepts. Typical visualizations (such as ball and stick) primarily depict covalent bonds. In contrast, non-covalent contacts between atoms, which govern normal physiology, pathogenesis, and drug action, are seldom visualized. The Protein Contacts Atlas has been developed as an interactive resource of non-covalent contacts from over 100,000 PDB crystal structures. This resource enables researchers from different disciplines to investigate diverse questions in the framework of non-covalent contacts, including the interpretation of allostery, disease mutations and polymorphisms, by exploring individual subunits, interfaces, and protein-ligand contacts and by mapping external information.
