QUESTION: What is the effect of CRD-BP on the stability of c-myc mRNA?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The c-myc mRNA coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) has high affinity for the coding region determinant (CRD) of c-myc mRNA. Such affinity is believed to protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack.
- The coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) binds in vitro to c-myc mRNA and is thought to stabilize the mRNA and increase c-Myc protein abundance  

EXACT_ANSWER:
- To protect c-myc CRD from endonucleolytic attack.
