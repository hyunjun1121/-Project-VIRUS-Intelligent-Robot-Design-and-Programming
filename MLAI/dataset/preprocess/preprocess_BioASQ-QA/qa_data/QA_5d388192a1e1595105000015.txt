QUESTION: What distinguishes RIDLs from other transpozable elements?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Here, we link these two concepts by proposing that exonic TEs act as RNA domains that are essential for lncRNA function. We term such elements Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs).
- One class of sequence elements that is enriched in lncRNA is represented by transposable elements (TEs), repetitive mobile genetic sequences that have contributed to genome evolution through a process termed exaptation. We term such elements Repeat insertion domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs).
- Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs) are exonic TEs that are essential for lncRNA function.
- Ancient exapted transposable elements promote nuclear enrichment of human long noncoding RNAs . A growing number of RIDLs have been experimentally defined, where TE-derived fragments of lncRNA act as RNA-, DNA-, and protein-binding domains . We term such elements Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDL)
- Exonic TEs act as RNA domains that are essential for lncRNA function. We term such elements Repeat Insertion Domains of LncRNAs (RIDLs)

EXACT_ANSWER:
- they are exonic
