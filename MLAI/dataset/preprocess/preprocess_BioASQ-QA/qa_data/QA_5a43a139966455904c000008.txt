QUESTION: What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq.
