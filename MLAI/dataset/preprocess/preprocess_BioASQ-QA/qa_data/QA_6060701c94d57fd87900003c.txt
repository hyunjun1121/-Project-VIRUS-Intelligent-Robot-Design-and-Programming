QUESTION: Which R/bioconductor package exists for discovery of intergenic transcripts?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collection of RNA-seq data sets, a novel '1-Step' approach named pooling RNA-Seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) has been developed that build transcript models from pooled RNA- sequencing data sets. PRAM is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package.
- PRAM is a novel pooling approach for discoveries of intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments.
- PRAM is a novel pooling approach for discovering intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments. PRAM is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package. It covers raw reads alignment, RNA methylation site detection, motif discovery and functional analysis. More than 50% of reconstructed transcripts represent novel transcriptome elements, including 8,343 novel exons and exon extensions of annotated coding genes, 11,217 novel antisense transcripts and 29,541 novel intergenic transcript or their fragments showing canonical features of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
- Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM) is a novel approach for discovering intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments. Applying PRAM to 30 human ENCODE RNA-seq data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts.
- PRAM (Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models) is a novel pooling approach for discovering intergenic transcripts from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments.
