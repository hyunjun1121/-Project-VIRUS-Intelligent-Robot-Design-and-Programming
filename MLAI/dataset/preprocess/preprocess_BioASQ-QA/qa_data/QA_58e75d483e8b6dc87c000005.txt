QUESTION: Which gene controls the expression of GATA-1 isoforms?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.  This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript.
- A transcriptional network has been reported, in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.
- In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation.
- Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development.
