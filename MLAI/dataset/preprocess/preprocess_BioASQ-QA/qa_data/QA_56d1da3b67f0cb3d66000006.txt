QUESTION: How many periods of regulatory innovation led to the evolution of vertebrates?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Investigators proposed that there have been three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Three
