QUESTION: Which MAP kinase phosphorylates the transcription factor c-jun?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- c-Jun is phosphorylated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK).
- An in vitro kinase assay revealed that c-Jun phosphorylation is primarily mediated via activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK).

EXACT_ANSWER:
- c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
- JNK
