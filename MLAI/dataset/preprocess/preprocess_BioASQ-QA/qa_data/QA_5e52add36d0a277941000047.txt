QUESTION: Which cloud-based platform has been developed for comparing GWAS?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- EasyGWAS is a cloud-based platform for comparing the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
- The ever- growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects. In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, easyGWAS has been developed as a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing, storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- easyGWAS
