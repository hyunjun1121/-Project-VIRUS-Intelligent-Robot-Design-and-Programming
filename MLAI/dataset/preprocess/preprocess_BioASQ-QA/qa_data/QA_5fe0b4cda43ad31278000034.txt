QUESTION: Which conditions is caused by mutations in HFE?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Mutations in the HFE gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein HFE1, are the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis.
- Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage . The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation in HFE . The study was to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder in South Africa . The authors suggest lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage .
- Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE.
- Mutations in the HFE gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that is hallmarked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs.
- Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians. Hereditary hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation.
- Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE. HFE mutation can possess the risk of AD in transferrin-, APOE- and APP-normal patients.
- Mutations in HFE, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause hereditary hemochromatosis.
- The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined Hereditary hemochromatosis: HFE mutation analysis in Greeks reveals genetic heterogeneity Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians; reported disease frequencies vary from 0.3 to 0.8%.
- Mutations in HFE, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, are the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis.
- HFE, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, is involved in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

EXACT_ANSWER:
