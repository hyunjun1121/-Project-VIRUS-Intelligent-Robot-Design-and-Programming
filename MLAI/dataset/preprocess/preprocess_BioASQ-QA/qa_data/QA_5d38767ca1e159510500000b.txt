QUESTION: In which cells does TLR7 escape X-chromosome inactivation?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The tlr7 gene encodes by an x chromosome locus. Tlr7 is encoded by an x-chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and klinefelter syndrome patients.
- TLR7 evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells.
- TLR7 escape X-chromosome inactivation by RNA polymerase II (ChIP-seq) DNA methylation to produce active TLR7 in immune cells
- TLR7 escape X-chromosome inactivation by becoming activated in response to DNA damage caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations on the X chromosome. In addition, TLR7 expression can also be observed in a dose-dependent manner in immune cells, such as epithelial cells, monocytes and macrophages.
- immune cells
- TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males

EXACT_ANSWER:
- immune cells
