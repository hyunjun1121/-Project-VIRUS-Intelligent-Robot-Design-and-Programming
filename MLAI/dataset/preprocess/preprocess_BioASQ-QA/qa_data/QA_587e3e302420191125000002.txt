QUESTION: Which R / bioconductor package is used for enrichment analysis of genomic regions?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- locus overlap analysis (lola) provides easy and automatable enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating the interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
- Genomic datasets are often interpreted in the context of large-scale reference databases. Locus Overlap Analysis (LOLA) provides easy and automatable enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating the interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
