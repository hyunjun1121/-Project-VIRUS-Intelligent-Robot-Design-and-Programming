QUESTION: Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).
- The TLR7 locus acts on the X chromosome in humans and is located on chromosome 9 (XC7)
- TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production.
- The X chromosome. TLR7 is encoded on X chromosome Xp22.
- TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) In this review we will discuss the role of the X chromosome encoded toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the development of autoimmunity.
- TLR7 (located on the X chromosome). Since the TLR7 gene is localized on the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was analyzed separately in males and females. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8 genes.
- The X chromosome. TLR7 is encoded on X chromosome XP22.
- The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production . The major candidate gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7 . The Toll like receptor 7 gene is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR 7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells .
- The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production.
- The X chromosome. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on X chromosome Xp22.
- TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse. X-Chromosome complement and estrogen receptor signaling independently contribute to the enhanced TLR 7-mediated IFN-α production of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from women.
