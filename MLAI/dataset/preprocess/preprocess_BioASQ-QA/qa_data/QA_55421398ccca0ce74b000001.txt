QUESTION: What type of DNA repair pathways is initiated by AlkA glycosylase?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The AlkA protein (3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein) is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair (BER) pathway.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- base excision repair (BER) pathway
