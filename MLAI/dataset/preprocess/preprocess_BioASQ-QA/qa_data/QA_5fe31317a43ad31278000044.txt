QUESTION: The formation of which inflammatory molecule is regulated by MAP3K8 (TPL2)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- MAP3K8 (Tpl2) regulates the formation of inflammatory molecule IL-1β
- MAP3K8 (Tpl2) regulates the formation of IL-1β by masking its inflammatory function.
- MAP3K8 (also known as Map3k8) regulates the formation of IL-1β
- IL-1β formation is regulated by MAP3K8 (TPL2)
- Tpl2 as an important mediator for collaboration of pattern recognition receptors with danger-associated molecular patterns to induce TNF and IL-1beta production and optimal host defense.
- MAP3K8 is involved in local adipose tissue inflammation, specifically for IL-1β and its responsive cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, but does not seem to have systemic effects on insulin resistance.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- IL-1β
- IL1-beta
