QUESTION: Which network analysis method can you use for prioritization of metabolic disease genes?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- metPropagate is a network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes.  metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs.
- Many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are amenable to treatment, therefore early diagnosis is imperative. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. MetPropagate is a network-based approach that uses untargeted metabolomics (UM) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs.
- MetPropagate is a network-guided propagation of metabolomic information for prioritization of metabolic disease genes. Basically, you take a single patient and a group of controls, and compare their metabolomic data to the data of other patients with IEMs. If you find a gene that is in the top 20% of the population, you rank it higher in the network. If not, you don't rank it at all.
