QUESTION: What is the main difference between nascent and mature chromatin?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Nascent chromatin is created after transcription and is mostly lacking histone modifications and H1, which makes it more prone to digestion by DNaseI.
-  Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin).
- The nascent and mature forms of chromatin differ in two aspects of their histone modifications: polycistronic messengers are expressed as a sequence of individual nucleosomes only in mature chromatin, and the nucleosome is involved in both transcription and repair processes.
-  The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure  Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin). Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin.
- Mature and nascent chromatin differ in two aspects of their histone modifications: polycistronic messengers are expressed as a sequence of individual nucleosomes only in mature cells, and they are preferentially expressed in the later stages of cell development.
- In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin).

EXACT_ANSWER:
- lack of H1
