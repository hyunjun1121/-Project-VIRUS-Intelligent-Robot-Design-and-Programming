QUESTION: What is the frequency of mutations induced spontaneously through Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Theoretical considerations and empirical analysis suggest that the per-base mutation frequency for a fractionated-dose treatment protocol is on the order of 1 sequence change per 10(5) bp.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- 1/100000
