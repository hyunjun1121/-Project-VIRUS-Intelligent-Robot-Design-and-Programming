QUESTION: Which complex is bound by estrogen-related receptor Î² (Esrrb)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Co-motif discovery identifies an Esrrb-Sox2-DNA ternary complex as a mediator of transcriptional differences between mouse embryonic and epiblast stem cells.
- Knockdown of Mp1 redirected FGF4 signaling from differentiation toward pluripotency and up-regulated the pluripotency-related genes Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, and Sox2. Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- The Esrrb-Sox2 complex
