QUESTION: Which is the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the human population?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis varies according to the population. A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. However, real data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98.
