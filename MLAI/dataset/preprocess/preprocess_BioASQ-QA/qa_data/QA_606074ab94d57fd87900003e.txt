QUESTION: Which R package can infer protein-protein interactions via thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Rtpca is an R package implemented methods for inferring protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on thermal proteome profiling experiments of a single condition or in a differential setting via an approach called thermal proximity coaggregation. It offers user-friendly tools to explore datasets for their PPI predictive performance and easily integrates with available R packages.
