QUESTION: What percentage of C. elegans genes reside in operons?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes.
- Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter.
- Approximately 15% of the genes in C. elegans are operons.
- Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter. Both methods indicate that the pre-mRNAs of about 70% of Caenorhabditis elegans  genes are trans-spliced and as many as a quarter are transcribed in these operons.
- about 15% of genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism belonging to Nematoda, reside in operons (Blumenthal et al. 2002; Blumenthal and Gleason 2003). For two reasons, nematode and prokaryotic operons are believed to have separate origins.
- Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter.
- Our data indicate that 15% of the genes in C. elegans reside in operons.
- Approximately 15% of the genes in C. elegans are located in operons, of which at least 15% are known to date.
- Nearly 15% of the ~20,000 C. elegans genes are contained in operons, multigene clusters controlled by a single promoter. Our evidence indicates that the genome contains at least 1,000 operons, 2 8 genes long, that contain about 15% of all C. elegans genes. Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C. elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome.
