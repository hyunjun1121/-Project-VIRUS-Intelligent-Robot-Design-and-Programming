QUESTION: What is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in CLCN2?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism, which is the most common and curable form of arterial hypertension.
- A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism. 
- A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism. The leukodystrophy of Glialcam, which is encoded in the gene, is associated with dysregulated extracellular ion homeostasis, and abnormal RPE cell function.
- Primary aldosteronism is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in CLCN2 and clinically characterized by severe intrauterine and post-natal growth retardation
- A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism.
- Primary aldosteronism is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in CLCN2.
- A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism is the most common and curable form of secondary arterial hypertension.
- Primary aldosteronism is the most common and curable form of secondary arterial hypertension. A gain-of-function mutation in the CLCN2 chloride channel gene causes primary aldosteronism.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Primary aldosteronism
