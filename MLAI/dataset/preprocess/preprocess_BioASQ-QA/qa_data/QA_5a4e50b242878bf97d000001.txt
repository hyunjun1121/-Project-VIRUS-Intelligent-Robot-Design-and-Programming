QUESTION: Which topoisomerase is essential in yeast?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is essential for cell proliferation. Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene.
- Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function.
- Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- topoisomerase II
- topo II
