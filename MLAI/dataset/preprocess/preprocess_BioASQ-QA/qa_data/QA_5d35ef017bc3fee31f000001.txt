QUESTION: Which epigenetic mark is deposited by PRC2?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- H3K27me3 is the major histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2.
- The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) has been identified as a key regulator of epigenetic mark H3K27me3.
- There are data showing coordinate regulation between DNAme and H3K27me3, which are both involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/me3), binds to its own site of methylation.
- H3K27me3 is the endogenous epigenetic mark deposited by PRC2.
- H3K27me3 is an epigenetic mark deposited by PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2).
- polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2 ) mediates trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone h3
- Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27, which establishes H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic marks that promote tissue-specific differentiation by silencing ectopic gene programs.
- PRC2 is H3K27me3 ubiquitously-associated and acts as an epigenetic mark deposition mechanism.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- H3K27me3
