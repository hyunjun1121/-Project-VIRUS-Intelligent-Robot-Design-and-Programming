QUESTION: What is the preferred orientation of CTCF binding sites for chromatin looping?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another.
- As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites  and chromatin loops. Recent reports have suggested that CTCF binding is more dynamic during development than previously appreciated. 
- As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- convergent
- Convergent orientation
