QUESTION: Which kinase is inhibited by the small molecule KN-93?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) is inhibited by the small molecule KN-93. KN-93 is a membrane-permeant calcium/calmodulin- dependent kinase II (CaMK-II)-selective inhibitor

EXACT_ANSWER:
- The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II
- CaM kinase II
- CAMK2
