QUESTION: Which is the major RNA editing enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. 
- The ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster.

The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic Determinants of RNA Editing Levels of ADAR Targets in Drosophila melanogaster. TIRs were deduced to form dsRNAs as a putative target of ADAR. we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature. 
- Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a highly conserved process that post-transcriptionally modifies mRNA, generating proteomic diversity, particularly within the nervous system of metazoans. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets. RNA editing by deamination of specific adenosine bases to inosines during pre-mRNA processing generates edited isoforms of proteins. RNA editing is proposed as a modulator of transcriptomes, but its biological impact has not been fully elucidated. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts.

- GABA inhibitory signalling is impaired in human epileptic and autistic conditions, and vertebrate ADARs may have a relevant evolutionarily conserved control over neuronal excitability. RNA editing usually affects only a fraction of expressed transcripts and there is a vast amount of variation in editing levels of ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) targets.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- ADAR
- adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific
