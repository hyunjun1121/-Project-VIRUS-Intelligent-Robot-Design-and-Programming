QUESTION: Which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase of Hsp90?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) can mediate ubiquitination of the 90 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp90) in vitro, with subsequent proteasomal degradation of the chaperone.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP)
