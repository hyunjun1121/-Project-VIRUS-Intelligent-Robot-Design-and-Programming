QUESTION: Which is the protein-membrane interface of the Cholesterol-regulated Start protein 4 protein (STARD4)?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- L124 is the protein-membrane interface of the Cholesterol-regulated Start protein 4 protein (STARD4).
- Our results show that STARD4 interacts with anionic membranes through a surface-exposed basic patch and that introducing a mutation (L124D) into the Omega-1 (Ω1) loop, which covers the sterol binding pocket, attenuates sterol transfer activity.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- L124
- Omega-1 (Ω1) loop
