QUESTION: For which type of cancer can uc.189 be used as a potential prognostic biomarker?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- ESCC
- High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients. Uc.189 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which provides a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
- Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. Uc.189 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which provides a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC)
