QUESTION: What is the role of gamma-secreatase complex in Alzheimer's Disease?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, as it cleaves a precursor protein to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients. Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- cleaves a precursor protein to create the amyloid beta peptide
