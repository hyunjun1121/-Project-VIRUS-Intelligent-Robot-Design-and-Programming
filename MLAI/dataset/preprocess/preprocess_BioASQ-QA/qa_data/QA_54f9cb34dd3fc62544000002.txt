QUESTION: Which protein has been found to interact with phospholamban (PLN) and is also an anti-apoptotic protein?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function.The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential.
- The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. and was identified as a phospholamban-binding partner. Using the yeast-two-hybrid system, HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner.
- The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis.Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- The HS-1 associated protein X-1
- (HAX-1)
