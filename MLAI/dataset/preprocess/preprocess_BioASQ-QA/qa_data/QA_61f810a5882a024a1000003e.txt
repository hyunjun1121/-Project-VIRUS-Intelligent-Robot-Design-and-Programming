IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in IPO8 cause a syndromic form of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) with clinical overlap with Loeys-Dietz and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndromes.
- Importin, a member of the importin-Î² protein family, is a protein that translocates cargo molecules, proteins, and ribonucleoprotein complexes into the nucleus in RanGTP-dependent manner. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in IPO8 cause a syndromic form of thoracic aortic aneurysm.
