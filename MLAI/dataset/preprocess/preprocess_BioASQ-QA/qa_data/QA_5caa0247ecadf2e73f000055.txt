QUESTION: What protein is recruited by Crumbs to regulate tracheal development?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells make seamless tubes, Early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moesin (Moe), which in turn regulates seamless tube shape in the development of the trachea.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- moesin (Moe)
