QUESTION: Which method is behind HipMCL?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- HipMCL is a high-performance parallel implementation of the Markov clustering algorithm for large-scale networks. Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands.
- While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. HipMCL is based on MPI and OpenMP and is freely available under a modified BSD license.

Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. High-performance MCL (HipMCL) offers a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks.
