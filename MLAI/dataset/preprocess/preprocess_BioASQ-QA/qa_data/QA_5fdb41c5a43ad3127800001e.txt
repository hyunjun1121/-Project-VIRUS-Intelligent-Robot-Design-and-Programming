QUESTION: What is FeatureCounts used for?

IDEAL_ANSWER:
- featureCounts is a general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features. It is a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments.
- featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features. We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments
- featureCounts can be used to quantify reads generated from either RNA or DNA sequencing technologies in terms of any type of genomic feature. It implements chromosome hashing, feature blocking and other strategies to assign reads to features with high efficiency.
- Featurecounts is a system that uses a novel Bayesian approach to calculate informative metrics at each depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. The database is optimized to support fast interactive performance with the RNA-Seq platform.
