What is the typical alteration of the thyroid profile metabolism early after coronary artery bypass graft surgery?

[PMID: 6422832]
The effect of a surgical stress on serum TSH, T4, free T4, T3, rT3 and TBG was measured before, during and after a coronary bypass operation. Precautions were taken to age, sex, pre-operative nutritional state, anamnestic illness, pre- and post-operative medication. Compared to the pre-operative period TSH increased during operation and normalized at the first post-operative day, while only minor alterations for total and free serum T4 were observed. T3 and rT3 declined at the start of extracorporal circulation, T3 remained reduced during the post-operative period, while rT3 reached its pre-operative value at the first post-operative day. It is concluded that the coronary bypass operation evokes a rapid decline in T3, which is not normalized by the TSH induced response of the thyroid gland, while the post-operative period is characterized by a "low T3 state". The clinical relevance of this finding is discussed with respect to the cardiovascular and the nutritional state of the patients in the post-operative period.

The non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is considered a transient and completely reversible phenomenon, but it has been shown that it may last for several days postoperatively after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. This study was undertaken to assess thyroid function 6 months after uncomplicated CABG. The thyroid profile was evaluated in 40 consecutive patients undergoing CABG preoperatively, at 0, 12, 48, and 120 h postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. Triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were assayed using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. T4 and total serum thyroid hormone-binding capacity (T-uptake) were measured on the same samples using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Patients with severe systemic illness and patients treated with amiodarone were excluded. All patients were euthyroid at admission. Mean age was 67.4+/-9.0 years. There were 31 (77.5%) men. Typical NTIS was observed in all patients, and the FT3 concentration was still reduced by postoperative day 5 (p<0.0001). At 6-month follow-up, all patients were free from cardiac symptoms, and no new cardiac events were recorded. The thyroid profile was normal in 35 patients (87.5%). One patient (4.5%) had developed overt hypothyroidism. Two patients had isolated low T3 and FT3 levels with normal TSH. Two patients had moderately increased FT3 levels with suppressed TSH. In most uncomplicated patients, thyroid function returns to normal 6 months after CABG. However, we observed significant alterations of the thyroid profile in 5 out of 40 patients. Further studies are needed to define the long-term consequences of postoperative NTIS.

The authors sought to assess biochemical, hormonal and cellular repercussions from use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Eighteen patients underwent on-pump CABG surgery. Mean time of CPB was 80.3 minutes. Hormonal, biochemical and cellular measurements were taken in some time points - preoperatively, immediately after coming off CPB, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were applied based on significance level of 5%. There was activation and significant elevation of total leukocytes and neutrophils count over CPB, remaining this way up to 48 hours postoperatively. Total platelets count, in turn, was marked by relevant reduction immediately after coming off CPB as well as in two postoperative time points. Serum levels of total proteins and albumin, immediately after coming off CPB and also in two postoperative time points, were significantly decreased comparing with preoperative status. There was remarkable reduction of total T3, free T3 and total T4 particularly up to first 24 hours postoperatively. In on-pump CABG surgery, inflammatory effects encompass activation of total leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets, reduction of serum level of total proteins and albumin and decreased thyroid hormones levels, especially within first postoperative 24 hours.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is an established cause of nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) has been reported to be less invasive than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CPB. We prospectively evaluated thyroid metabolism in OPCAB patients. We analyzed free thyroid hormones (FT3 and FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and reverse T3 (rT3) in 20 consecutive patients undergoing CABG surgery. Nine patients underwent CABG with CPB, and 11 underwent OPCAB. Blood samples were taken on admission, on the day of surgery (7:30 AM), after sternotomy, at the end of the operation, and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours postoperatively. The concentrations of FT3, FT4, and TSH were determined on each sample. Reverse T3 concentration was measured in 10 patients up to 48 hours and at 144 hours postoperatively. Baseline, operative, and postoperative variables were similar in the two groups. FT3 concentration dropped significantly (p < 0.0001), reaching its lowest value 12 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences between CPB and OPCAB patients. FT4 varied significantly in both groups (p < 0.0001), but remained in the normal range. TSH variation was not significant. rT3 concentration rose significantly (p = 0.0002) in both groups, peaking 24 hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS. OPCAB induces a NTIS similar to that observed after CPB, probably due to the inhibition of T4 conversion to T3. This finding suggests that NTIS is a nonspecific response to stress. CPB should not be considered as the sole trigger of NTIS in cardiac surgical patients.

The postoperative period after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with a low T3 syndrome, i.e. low T3 and fT3 concentrations in the presence of normal T4 and TSH concentrations. So far, results from studies evaluating thyroid function during and after CPB are rather conflicting. We therefore evaluated prospectively thyroid function in 28 patients before, during and up to 3 days after coronary artery bypass surgery. We could demonstrate the most significant changes in thyroid hormone concentrations on day 1 after CPB (low T3 and fT3 concentrations, elevated rT3 concentrations in the presence of a significant fall of TSH). T3 fell from 1.93 to 0.6 nmol/1 and fT3 from 5.5 to 1.42 pmol/1. Those patients with low cardiac output syndrome after surgery had significantly lower T3 concentrations than patients without this complication. Moreover, those patients, who already had significant lower T3 values prior to CPB, also demonstrated low T3 concentrations on day 1 after CPB. Cortisol usually has a suppressive effect on TSH secretion. However, the effect of cortisol on TSH in patients undergoing CPB seems to be not that important: those patients with high endogenous cortisol concentrations on day 1 after CPB had similar TSH values to those patients with only slightly elevated cortisol concentrations. Also, the application of high doses of catecholamines seems to have only minor effects on TSH secretion, because those patients requiring high doses of dopamine over a prolonged time period had essentially the same TSH values after CPB. Patients who had been exposed preoperatively to high doses of iodine did not demonstrate significantly different thyroid hormone concentrations. We could demonstrate that CPB induces a low T3 syndrome up to 3 days after surgery. Those patients with low T3 concentrations prior to surgery demonstrate postoperatively a more severe degree of nonthyroidal illness (NTI). Catecholamines and cortisol seem to have only minor effects on the TSH secretion after CPB. The influence of a previous iodine contamination is negligible.
