Which disease the skin condition Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is associated to?

[PMID: 11259927]
Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a rare skin condition associated with diabetes, which characteristically occurs in the pretibial region of the lower limbs (Boulton et al., 1988). The lesions generally appear as well-circumscribed reddish plaques, which are most often asymptomatic, resulting primarily in cosmetic disability. Currently, there is no reliable form of treatment for NLD, although many regimens have been tried (Shall et al., 1990)

Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare chronic granulomatous dermatitis that usually appears in the lower extremities. It affects about 0.3-1.2% of diabetic patients, the majority of whom have type 1 diabetes. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder are still unclear. NL is characterized by skin rash that usually affects the shins. The average onset is 30 years, with females being affected more commonly. There are very few reported cases of necrobiosis lipoidica in children. We report a case of a 16 year old girl affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (15 years disease duration) who developed an erythematous nodular rash on the lower extremities and interscapular area. In the suspect of necrobiosis lipoidica, a skin biopsy was performed (lower extremities and interscapular area). The microscopic evaluation of the pretibial lesions was suggestive of necrobiosis lipoidica. The smaller lesions in the interscapular area showed signs of perivascular dermatitis which could be consistent with early stages of necrobiosis lipoidica. Local treatment with tacrolimus determined a progressive improvement of the lesions. In patients with T1DM, diagnosis of NL of the lower legs is usually unequivocal. However, diagnosis may be more challenging in the presence of lesions with recent onset and/or atypical clinical presentation and unusual site. In these cases, NL must always be taken in consideration in order to avoid misdiagnosis, wrong/late treatment decisions and progression to ulceration.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is an inflammatory granulomatous skin disease of unknown etiology which is associated with diabetes mellitus in about 60% of the patients. In 15-35% of the affected patients painful ulcerations may occur after minimal trauma which can be extremely refractory to therapy. Because of the unknown pathomechanisms, current therapeutic options are limited. We report on a 68-year-old patient with an 18 year history of ulcerated necrobiosis lipoidica non diabeticorum of both lower limbs, which responded to systemic cyclosporine A. Based on this case, we discuss the role of cyclosporine A in patients with necrobiosis lipoidica in the context of the disease etiology.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a skin disorders with an interesting predisposition for areas of trauma such as the anterior shins. In this report a patient with diabetes mellitus and generalized necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with localization in surgical scars is described. A brief review of other skin disorders occurring in scars is also included.

In order to evaluate patients with necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and to compare them with age, sex, and duration of diabetes matched controls, 15 patients with necrobiosis were each matched with 5 control subjects with diabetes mellitus. Complications of diabetes, glycaemic control, and proteinuria were measured. Patients with necrobiosis (mean age 40, range 18-74 years) had a mean duration of diabetes of 14 (range 3-36) years; 8 patients were male, and 7 were female. For necrobiosis versus controls, background retinopathy (67% vs 27%, p = 0.009), proteinuria (53% vs 17%, p = 0.006), and smoking (60% vs 20%, p = 0.003) were all more common with necrobiosis. There were no significant differences between patients with necrobiosis and control patients in the prevalence of vascular disease and neuropathy. Glycosylated haemoglobin concentrations were higher in patients with necrobiosis (p = 0.02). Blood pressure measurements were similar in both groups. We conclude that smoking, proteinuria, and retinopathy were more prevalent in diabetic patients with necrobiosis; the skin lesion may therefore share common aetiological factors which affect the microvascular circulation, leading to damage to basement membranes and vascular endothelial cells.

The etiologies of a variety of skin conditions associated with diabetes have not been fully explained. One possible etiological factor is diabetic microangiopathy, which is known to affect the eyes and kidneys in patients with diabetes. There are many mechanisms by which diabetes may cause microangiopathy. These include excess sorbitol formation, increased glycation end products, oxidative damage, and protein kinase C overactivity. All of these processes occur in the skin, and the existence of a cutaneous diabetic microangiopathy has been well demonstrated. These microangiopathic changes are associated with abnormalities of skin perfusion. Because the skin plays a thermoregulatory role, there is significant capillary redundancy in normal skin. In diabetic patients, loss of capillaries is associated with a decrease in perfusion reserve. This lost reserve is demonstrable under stressed conditions, such as thermal stimulation. The associated failure of microvascular perfusion to meet the requirements of skin metabolism may result in diverse skin lesions in patients with diabetes. Many skin conditions peculiar to diabetes are fairly rare. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) and diabetic bullae occur very infrequently as compared with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. Conversely, there is a correlation between diabetic microvascular disease and NLD. This correlation also exists with more common skin conditions, such as diabetic dermopathy. This relationship suggests that diabetic microangiopathy may contribute to these conditions even if it is not primarily causal. Clinically, the major significance of diabetic cutaneous microangiopathy is seen in skin ulceration which is very common and has a major impact on diabetic patients. Many factors contribute to the development of diabetic foot ulcers. Neuropathy, decreased large vessel perfusion, increased susceptibility to infection, and altered biomechanics all play a role, but there is no doubt that inadequate small blood vessel perfusion is a major cause of the inability to heal small wounds that eventually results in ulcer formation. The accessibility of skin capillaries makes cutaneous diabetic microangiopathy an attractive model for research on the evolution of microvascular disease in diabetic patients.

Many of the complications of the diabetes are well studied but robust research documenting the cutaneous effects of the disease remains sparse. Various studies have suggested that the majority of patients with diabetes will suffer a skin disorder during the course of their disease and for some, the skin changes may even precede the diagnosis of diabetes. Cutaneous pathology of the diabetic foot and lower leg can arise as a result of the direct or indirect effects of diabetic complications. The most common manifestations include fungal and bacterial skin infection, nail disease and diabetic dermopathy. Other less commonly observed conditions include diabetic bullae, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD), granuloma annulare and reddening of the soles. For many of the less common disorders, there is little in the way of effective treatment. However, much can be done in the clinical setting in the management of the more common manifestations such as bacterial and fungal infection. Fungal infection, in particular, although relatively inconspicuous, is a very common foot problem and if left untreated can threaten tissue viability in the diabetic foot leading to secondary bacterial infection and cellulitis. Management of fungal disease is often considered difficult due to high relapse and re-infection rates, although by introducing a combination of therapies including mechanical and pharmacological the success in treating this stubborn condition can be greatly improved.

Granuloma annulare and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum have rarely been reported in the same patient. We describe the unusual case of a woman with diabetes and a history of generalized granuloma annulare who noted leg ulcers that clinically represented ulcerated necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and had histologic features of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and granuloma annulare. Her condition responded to treatment with antiplatelet agents.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated long-term complications have become a significant health problem in adolescents. We report a 16-year-old girl with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who had recurrent necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum associated with venous insufficiency.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a granulomatous skin reaction found in < 1% of diabetic patients. Our purpose was to determine if NLD represented areas of cutaneous ischemia. Using laser Doppler flowmetry, we measured cutaneous blood flow in nine diabetic patients at NLD lesions and at contiguous uninvolved sites. Flow values were also determined at several reference sites noncontiguous with the NLD lesions and compared to age- and sex-matched controls: 24 diabetic subjects without skin abnormalities, 18 diabetic patients with dermopathy, and 40 nondiabetic subjects. NLD lesions exhibited significantly higher blood flow (4.8 +/- 0.7 ml/min/100 g) than areas of unaffected skin close to the lesions (1.2 +/- 0.1 ml/min/100 g) (P < 0.01 for both comparisons). There were no significant differences in flow between normal skin sites in NLD patients and normal sites in diabetic patients without skin lesions. Our findings refute the hypothesis that NLD is a manifestation of microvascular ischemic disease of the skin. The increased blood flow seen in NLD lesions suggests an ongoing inflammatory process.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare skin disorder, usually considered a marker for diabetes mellitus. More than half of the patients with necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum have diabetes mellitus, but less than one per cent of diabetes mellitus patients have necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. In the diabetes and dermatology literature, we find the position that there is no effect of glucose control on either the appearance of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum or the clinical course of the lesion. We base our challenge to this position on a critical review of the original data. And conclude on the contrary, that necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is usually associated with poor glucose control and that tighter glucose control, as currently practised, might improve or prevent the disorder.

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a range of dermatologic presentations, including granuloma annulare and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. Granuloma annulare occurs earlier than necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and the association with diabetes mellitus is much weaker. We describe two children with diabetes who both developed granuloma annulare and later, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. We postulate that the early onset and transient nature of granuloma annulare, compared with the later onset and persistence of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, might account for the different apparent rates of association with diabetes mellitus.

The prevalence of persistent microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was assessed in 18 children and adolescents with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who suffered from necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) and in 40 diabetics without NLD, matched for sex, age, duration of disease, and metabolic control. The mean +/- SD age of the patients was 15.1 +/- 8.6 years (range 7.9-23.9 yrs) and their duration of IDDM was 10.9 +/- 8.1 years (range 7.1-21.0 yrs). Their mean glycosylated hemoglobin level was 9.9 +/- 5.0% (7.3-16.6%) and their fructosamine level was 274 +/- 180 mumol/L (199-466 mumol/L). Patients with NLD had a higher frequency of persistent microalbuminuria (p < 0.001) and retinopathy (p < 0.001) than those without NLD. Our study suggests that children as well as adult diabetics with NLD can be at high risk for nephropathy and retinopathy; NLD can be a clue for diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.

Necrobiosis lipoidica dibeticum (NLD) is a granulomatous skin disease mostly associated with diabetes mellitus. NLD has been reported in patients with other systemic disease. Also, the lesions of NLD may be clinically, and sometimes even histologically indistinguishable from other inflammatory skin lesions. We described three patients with established diagnosis of sarcoidosis that developed skin lesions consistent with NLD. The association of NLD-like skin lesion in sarcoidosis is not widely appreciated. The subject of NLD and sarcoidosis is reviewed.

A 32-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from morbid obesity with BMI 45,14 kg/m(2) was operated on. Not only the type 2DM but also one of its complication known as necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum remitted postoperatively. Obesity should no longer be regarded simply as a cosmetic problem affecting certain individuals but an epidemic that threatens global well-being. It causes or exacerbates many health problems, and in particular, it is associated with the type 2 diabetes. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a granulomatous skin disease of unknown etiology, associated mainly with diabetes mellitus. We presented in this paper a morbid obese case of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with dramatic good response to bariatric surgery.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an unusual dermatologic condition with a characteristic clinical appearance and a clear association with diabetes mellitus. There is currently no treatment that reverses the atrophic changes associated with this lesion. We have carried out a clinicopathologic study on 15 subjects and, in addition, have reviewed 10 further biopsy specimens of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. We found a frequent association of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with other chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, including limited joint mobility. It is possible that nonenzymatic glucosylation or other changes in collagen may be important in the etiology of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and the limited joint mobility. We confirmed that cutaneous anesthesia is usually present in the necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum lesions. With the use of an antibody to S100 protein and an immunohistochemical method, there was an apparent decreased number of nerves in the skin lesions. We suggest that sensory loss results from local destruction of cutaneous nerves by the inflammatory process. Finally, in six elliptical biopsies extending into clinically normal skin, we demonstrated that the inflammatory infiltrate of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum extended from the lesion into apparently normal skin surrounding clinically active lesions. Thus, intradermal steroids might be administered to perilesional areas surrounding active lesions in the hope of halting progression.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare disease of unclear etiology, that occurs in about 1% of diabetic patients. We present case of granulomatosis disciformis chronica et progressiva Miescher with good response to systemic corticosteroids therapy.Patient 45 years old woman, with primary yellow-brown areas skin lesions, with foci well separated from surroundings on both lower legs, that occurred 5 years ago. In laboratory tests there was no abnormalities. Because of advance suggestion (after last admit in dermatological ward) of observation according to xantogranuloma necrobioticum tests for paraproteinemia were made. Immunoelectrophoresis, IgG, IgM, IgA levels, kappa light chain, lambda heavy chain; were correct, Bence-Johns protein-negative. During hospitalization in Clinic methylprednisolone in dose of 32 mg od, vascular drugs and local steroidotherapy was applied with good therapeutic response. We described case of typical clinical and histological characters of necrobiosis lipoidica. without diabetes-granulomatosis disciformis chronica et progressiva Miescher that despite of suspicion of proper diagnosis for a long time was not treat effective.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus.It is said to occur more often in people with diabetes,a family history of diabetes,tendency to develop diabetes mellitus and those with insulin dependent diabetes. We report an evaluated case of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum residing in the northern part of Nigeria. The patient was treated for 3 weeks in the hospital on admission and was followed up in the general-out-patient department (GOPD) and has been in good health. To bring to the fore of clinicians this dermal complication of diabetes mellitus, the different medical treatments available and the medical treatment employed in our index patient. That necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum does exist in our environment and requires a high index of suspicion and scrupplelousness in making the diagnosis and treating the patient.

Diabetic Foot Syndrome (DFS) is the most costly and devastating complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), which early effective assessment can reduce the severity of complications including ulceration and amputations. This study aimed to review dermatological and musculoskeletal assessment of diabetic foot. In this review article, we searched for articles published between March 1, 1980 and July 28, 2015 in PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, for both English and non-English language articles with the following keywords: "Diabetic foot syndrome", "Ulceration", "Amputation", "Foot assessment", "Skin disorders" and "Musculoskeletal deformities". In dermatological dimension, most studies focused on elucidated changes in skin temperature, color, hardiness and turgor as well as common skin disorders such as Diabetic Dermopathy (DD), Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum (NLD) and Diabetic Bullae (DB), which are common in diabetic patients and have high potential for leading to limb-threatening problems such as ulceration and infection. In musculoskeletal dimension, most studies focused on range of motion and muscle strength, gait patterns and as well as foot deformities especially Charcot osteoarthropathy (COA), which is the most destructive musculoskeletal complication of diabetes. DFS as a common condition in DM patients lead to ulceration and lower limb amputation frequently unless a prompt and comprehensive assessment was taken. So that dermatological and musculoskeletal assessments are usually neglected in primary health care, these assessments should be done frequently to reduce the high risk of serious complications.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a chronic condition, which is characterized by single or multiple lesions on the legs, and occurs in 0.3% of patients with diabetes. Recently, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used in several clinical settings to promote sustained healing and better outcome. We propose the use of PRP for the treatment of NLD-associated recalcitrant wounds. In this study, 15 patients were treated with homologous PRP; all showed marked enhancement in wound healing without any adverse effects. After PRP application, advanced dressings were used until closure of the lesion was obtained, which was complete for all our patients. We therefore propose the use of PRP for recalcitrant wounds in patients with NLD.

Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare chronic granulomatous disease that has historically been associated with diabetes mellitus. Debate exists regarding the etiology and pathogenesis of NL with a widely accepted theory that microangiopathy plays a significant role. NL typically presents clinically as erythematous papules on the front of the lower extremities that can coalesce to form atrophic telangiectatic plaques. NL is usually a clinical diagnosis, but if the clinical suspicion is uncertain, skin biopsy specimen can help differentiate it from sarcoidosis, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, and granuloma annulare. NL is a difficult disease to manage despite a large armamentarium of treatment options that include topical and intralesional corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, platelet inhibitors, phototherapy, and surgery. Randomized control trials are lacking to evaluate the many treatment methods and establish a standard regimen of care. Disease complications such as ulceration are common, and lesions should also be monitored for transition to squamous cell carcinoma, a less common sequelae.

In 1877, Dr Heinrich Koebner inflicted an experimental trauma on the uninvolved skin of a psoriatic patient. This resulted in the appearance of a typical psoriatic lesion at the site of trauma. This reaction, known as Koebner's phenomenon (KP), has subsequently been associated with several skin diseases. However, it has not been associated previously with necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NBL), a rare skin manifestation of diabetes mellitus. This report presents the unusual finding of NBL associated with KP in a patient with diabetes mellitus.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a clinical syndrome characterized by hyperglycaemia due to absolute or relative insulin deficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of skin manifestations in patients with diabetes mellitus of this area. This descriptive study was conducted in medical out patient door of District Headquarter Hospital Battgram from January 2008 to July 2008. A total of 350 diabetic (types 1 and 2) patients over 15 years of age attending the medical OPD of DHQ Hospital were examined in detail for skin manifestations of the disease. Three hundred and fifty diabetic (type-1 and type-2) patients (193 females and 157 males) enrolled in this study. Mean age of the patients was 54 +/- 8.53 years. Duration of diabetes was between 1-12 years; 320 patients had type-2 and 30 patients had type-1 diabetes mellitus. Patients with uncontrolled disease were 327 and 23 patients showed adequate glycaemic control. Seventy-six percent of patients had cutaneous manifestations. The skin manifestations observed were: skin infections 30.9%, foot gangrene and ulcers 12.9%, pruritus 7.1%, vitiligo 5.7%, yellow skin 4.2%, diabetic dermopathy 4.2%, skin tags 3.7%, acanthosis nigricans 2.9%, eruptive xanthomas 2.6%, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum 1.4%, diabetic bullae 0.6%, and pigmented purpuras in 0.3% patients. Cutaneous manifestations were quite common in the diabetics of this area.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a rare, granulomatous inflammatory skin disease of unknown origin, sometimes associated with diabetes mellitus. Skin lesions usually develop on the lower extremities and can progress toward ulceration and scarring. Many treatments have been proposed, but few have demonstrated consistent efficacy, and no standard regimens have emerged to date. An 84-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus presented with a 3-year history of chronic right-lower-extremity erythematous papules and plaques that had developed into confluent ulcers with prominent granulation tissue and an orange-yellow hue. The results of a biopsy of the lesion was consistent with a diagnosis of NLD. The wound did not respond to 4 months of intensive local wound care. After the first intravenous infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg), there was rapid reduction in wound size, pain, and drainage. There was complete wound healing with excellent cosmesis at 6 weeks (total of 3 infusions). Infliximab should be considered in the treatment of refractory, ulcerative NLD. Its anti-tumor necrosis factor activity may underlie its efficacy in targeting this granulomatous process, and further investigation should be undertaken to confirm these results.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is an idiopathic dermatological condition that is strongly associated with diabetes mellitus. It is more commonly seen in women than men. The average age of onset is 30-40 years. Necrobiosis Lipoidica diabeticorum is an extremely rare finding in childhood diabetes. We describe the case of a 13-year-old girl who has had type 1 diabetes mellitus since she was 8 years old. The patient presented with 2 well-defined, persistent plaques with a depressed central area and elevated purple peripheral ring, one on the right thigh and the other over the lateral left leg. Histopathologic evaluation of the patient's biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of necrobiosis lipoidica with transfollicular elimination. Our patient is the second pediatric case described with perforating necrobiosis lipoidica. We review the literature and discuss clinical features, several complications, and the most recent treatment options for necrobiosis lipoidica in diabetic children.

Approximately 30% of patients with diabetes mellitus will have disease-related dermatological problems. Dry skin can be associated with autonomic neuropathy and may be fragile, promoting bacterial invasion. Any potentially infected 'diabetic foot' must be taken seriously, and non-painful deep sepsis suspected if there is evidence of sensory loss. Consideration should be given to eliminating nasal carriage of staphylococci if recurrent superficial sepsis occurs in the presence of poor diabetic control. Fungal infections, both of skin and nails, are common but usually not serious in the absence of immunosuppression. Treatment with topical antifungals may need to be combined with systemic therapy for successful eradication. Systemic antifungal therapy should be carefully considered as treatment needs to be prolonged and is potentially toxic, particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus who often have co-morbidities. Varicose eczema should be treated by physical therapies intended to improve venous return and prevent peripheral edema and tissue injury. Allergic dermatitis is commonly associated with topical treatments and other sensitizers. Many reactions are not apparent from history, and patch testing for sensitivity is recommended. There are several diabetes mellitus-specific conditions that dermatologists must be aware of, including, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, granuloma annulare, diabetic dermopathy (spotted leg syndrome or shin spots), diabetic bullae (bullosis diabeticorum), and limited joint mobility and waxy skin syndrome. Ulceration, due to varying combinations of peripheral vascular disease and sensory neuropathy, is the province of the specialist team dealing with the diabetic foot and should ideally be referred to an appropriate multidisciplinary team.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare inflammatory granulomatous skin disease of unknown etiology which is associated with diabetes mellitus in about 60 % of the patients. In up to 30 % of these patients extremely painful and often hard-to-heal ulcerations occur in the course of the disease. We present a new therapeutic option using adalimumab to treat refractory ulcerated necrobiosis lipoidica non diabeticorum. The clinical efficacy of adalimumab probably reflects an immunomodulatory effect through the specific TNF-α inhibition which is one central aspect of the underlying inflammation. Thus, adalimumab could represent promising new treatment option, especially for patients with otherwise therapy-refractory ulcerated necrobiosis lipoidica.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a rare degenerative connective tissue disorder associated with diabetes mellitus, which usually presents with red papules or plaques with raised edges and occasional ulceration. Ulcerating NLD is notoriously difficult to treat. We present a young patient with ulcerative NLD who was successfully treated with the anti-TNFα agent infliximab. Case presentation is followed by a review of therapeutic TNFα blockade in NLD. A 17-year old woman with type 1 diabetes since the age of 8, presented with a long-standing and extensively ulcerated and infected NLD lesion on her left shin. After achieving better glycemic control and treating her for infection of the wound, several NLD treatments failed to help, including corticosteroids and hyperbaric oxygen. She was treated successfully with 4 monthly sessions of 5mg/kg body weight intravenous infliximab, achieving complete resolution of ulceration. A multitude of available treatments have been suggested for NLD over the past decades, based on two axes, one through wound healing and the other through immunosuppression. Anti-TNFα agents are relatively new drugs that brought a revolution in chronic inflammatory diseases and have been on the rise as novel potential treatments for NLD. Three out of the five available anti-TNFα agents have been safely tested so far, both topically and systematically, with mostly favorable results. Intravenous infliximab was successful in the treatment of recalcitrant ulcerating NLD in our patient. Taken together with an increasing number of similar reports revealing a pathogenetic role of TNFα in NLD, we suggest that anti-TNFα agents are promising drugs in the management of this condition.
