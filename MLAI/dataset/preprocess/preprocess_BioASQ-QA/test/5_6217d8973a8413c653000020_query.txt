What is the role of cytidine deaminase in healthy cells?

[PMID: 34819671]
Efficient humoral responses rely on DNA damage, mutagenesis and error-prone DNA repair. Diversification of B cell receptors through somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination are initiated by cytidine deamination in DNA mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)<sup>1</sup> and by the subsequent excision of the resulting uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) and by mismatch repair proteins<sup>1-3</sup>. Although uracils arising in DNA are accurately repaired<sup>1-4</sup>, how these pathways are co-opted to generate mutations and double-strand DNA breaks in the context of somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination is unknown<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen for genes involved in class-switch recombination and identified FAM72A, a protein that interacts with the nuclear isoform of UNG (UNG2)<sup>5</sup> and is overexpressed in several cancers<sup>5</sup>. We show that the FAM72A-UNG2 interaction controls the levels of UNG2 and that class-switch recombination is defective in Fam72a<sup>-/-</sup> B cells due to the upregulation of UNG2. Moreover, we show that somatic hypermutation is reduced in Fam72a<sup>-/-</sup> B cells and that its pattern is skewed upon upregulation of UNG2. Our results are consistent with a model in which FAM72A interacts with UNG2 to control its physiological level by triggering its degradation, regulating the level of uracil excision and thus the balance between error-prone and error-free DNA repair. Our findings have potential implications for tumorigenesis, as reduced levels of UNG2 mediated by overexpression of Fam72a would shift the balance towards mutagenic DNA repair, rendering cells more prone to acquire mutations.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) catalyses the deamination of deoxycytidines to deoxyuracils within immunoglobulin genes to induce somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination<sup>1,2</sup>. AID-generated deoxyuracils are recognized and processed by subverted base-excision and mismatch repair pathways that ensure a mutagenic outcome in B cells<sup>3-6</sup>. However, why these DNA repair pathways do not accurately repair AID-induced lesions remains unknown. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we show that FAM72A is a major determinant for the error-prone processing of deoxyuracils. Fam72a-deficient CH12F3-2 B cells and primary B cells from Fam72a<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit reduced class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation frequencies at immunoglobulin and Bcl6 genes, and reduced genome-wide deoxyuracils. The somatic hypermutation spectrum in B cells from Fam72a<sup>-/-</sup> mice is opposite to that observed in mice deficient in uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2)<sup>7</sup>, which suggests that UNG2 is hyperactive in FAM72A-deficient cells. Indeed, FAM72A binds to UNG2, resulting in reduced levels of UNG2 protein in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, coinciding with peak AID activity. FAM72A therefore causes U·G mispairs to persist into S phase, leading to error-prone processing by mismatch repair. By disabling the DNA repair pathways that normally efficiently remove deoxyuracils from DNA, FAM72A enables AID to exert its full effects on antibody maturation. This work has implications in cancer, as the overexpression of FAM72A that is observed in many cancers<sup>8</sup> could promote mutagenesis.

APOBEC1 is a member of the AID/APOBECs, a group of deaminases responsible for the editing of C>U in both DNA and RNA. APOBEC1 is physiologically involved in C>U RNA editing: while hundreds of targets have been discovered in mice, in humans the only well-characterized target of APOBEC1 is the apolipoprotein B (ApoB) transcript. APOBEC1 edits a CAA codon into a stop codon, which causes the translation of a truncated form of ApoB. A number of assays have been developed to investigate this process. Early assays, poisoned primer extension and Sanger sequencing, have focused on accuracy and sensitivity but rely on extraction of the RNA from tissues and cells. More recently, the need to visualize the RNA editing process directly in live cells have led to the development of fluorescence-based tools. These assays detect RNA editing through reporters whose editing causes a change in cellular localization or a change in fluorescent properties. Here we review the available assays to quantify RNA editing, and we present the protocol for cytofluorimetric analysis using a double-fluorescent reporter.

The human genome contains 11 APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases classified into four families. These proteins function mainly in innate antiviral immunity and can also restrict endogenous retrotransposable element multiplication. The present study focuses on APOBEC3C (A3C), a member of the APOBEC3 subfamily. Some APOBEC3 proteins use their enzymatic activity on genomic DNA, inducing mutations and DNA damage, while other members facilitate DNA repair. Our results show that A3C is highly expressed in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Its expression is regulated by p53. Depletion of A3C slightly decreases proliferation and does not affect DNA repair via homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining. The A3C interactomes obtained from control cells and cells exposed to the genotoxin etoposide indicated that A3C is a nucleolar protein. This was confirmed by the detection of either endogenous or ectopic A3C in nucleoli. Interestingly, we show that A3C is excluded from areas of DNA breaks in live cells. Our data also indicate that the C-terminal part of A3C is responsible for its nucleolar localization and exclusion from DNA damage sites.

The AID/APOBEC family of enzymes are cytidine deaminases that act upon DNA and RNA. Among APOBECs, the best characterized family member to act on RNA is the enzyme APOBEC1. APOBEC1-mediated RNA editing plays a key role in lipid metabolism and in maintenance of brain homeostasis. Editing can be easily detected in RNA-seq data as a cytosine to thymine (C-to-T) change with regard to the reference. However, there are many other sources of base conversions relative to reference, such as PCR errors, SNPs, and even DNA editing by mutator APOBECs. Furthermore, APOBEC1 exhibits disparate activity in different cell types, with respect to which transcripts are edited and the level to which they are edited. When considering these potential sources of error and variability, an RNA-seq comparison between wild-type APOBEC1 sample and a matched control with an APOBEC1 knockout is a reliable method for the discrimination of true sites edited by APOBEC1. Here we present a detailed description of a method for studying APOBEC1 RNA editing, specifically in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Our method covers the production of an APOBEC1 knockout cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, through to experimental validation and quantification of editing sites (where we discuss a recently published algorithm (termed MultiEditR) which allows for the detection and quantification of RNA editing from Sanger sequencing). Importantly, this same protocol can be adapted to any RNA modification detectable by RNA-seq analysis for which the responsible protein is known.
