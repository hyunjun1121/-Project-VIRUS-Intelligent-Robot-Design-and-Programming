Which pathway is activated by ficolin-3?

[PMID: 21890891]
Ficolin-1 (M), ficolin-2 (L), ficolin-3 (H) and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) activate the complement system and have opsonic activity. The specificity of ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently limited to a few ligands only. We present new specific targets for human ficolin-3, identified among lipopolysaccharides (LPSs, endotoxin) of Hafnia alvei. The interaction was restricted to LPSs of four strains: 23, Polish Collection of Microorganisms (PCM) 1200, PCM 1203 and PCM 1205 and limited to their O-specific polysaccharides (O-specific PSs) composed of different numbers of oligosaccharide (OS) repeating units (RUs). Moreover, these LPS/ficolin-3 complexes activated the lectin pathway of complement in a C4b-deposition assay in a calcium- and magnesium-dependent way. A neoglycoconjugate of the O-specific PS fraction of H. alvei 1200 LPS with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared and used as a tool for the determination of ficolin-3 concentration and activity in serum. To confirm a structure of the O-specific PS 1200 selected for the conjugate preparation, structural analysis was performed on a series of O-specific PSs released by the mild acid hydrolysis of the LPS. The isolated O-specific PSs, showing the different length distributions, were devoid of a major part of the core OS region and had Hep-Kdo disaccharide at a reducing end. The neoglycoconjugate was a highly selective tool for the determination of ficolin-3 concentration and activity in serum (lectin pathway activation in the C4b deposition assay) and was not affected by MBL, ficolin-1 and ficolin-2 or natural antibodies.

The ficolins and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) are collagen-like defence proteins that serve as recognition molecules in lectin complement pathway. Differential features that may indicate diverse functions of these proteins are poorly understood. In this study we compared important biological features of the ficolins and MBL. We investigated the tissue distribution of the FCN1-3 and the MBL2 genes encoding the ficolins and MBL by quantitative PCR. Recombinant proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1 and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators.

The complement system plays a pathophysiological role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aims to investigate whether an association exists between the ficolins that are part of the lectin complement pathway and SLE. EDTA plasma samples from 68 Danish SLE patients and 29 healthy donors were included in the study. Plasma concentrations of Ficolin-1, -2, and -3 were determined in specific sandwich ELISAs. Lectin pathway activity via Ficolin-3 was measured in ELISA on acetylated bovine serum albumin (acBSA) and measured as Ficolin-3 binding and deposition of C4, C3 and the terminal complement complex (TCC). SLE patients had increased levels of Ficolin-3, 21.6μg/ml as compared to 17.0μg/ml in healthy controls (P=0.0098). The Ficolin-1 plasma concentration was negatively correlated with SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (Rho=-0.29, P=0.015) and positively correlated to the [Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index] (SDI) (Rho=0.27, P=0.026). The Ficolin-1 concentration was also associated with the occurrence of arterial (P=0.0053) but not venous thrombosis (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore, Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration.

Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene and expressed in the lung and liver, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system. Heterozygosity for an FCN3 frameshift mutation (rs28357092), leading to a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule, occurs in people without disease (allele frequency among whites, 0.01). We describe a patient with recurrent infections who was homozygous for this mutation, who had undetectable serum levels of ficolin-3, and who had a deficiency in ficolin-3-dependent complement activation.

Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two nonenzymatic proteins. MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the circulation. The significance of lectin pathway complexes in the circulation is unknown. Thus, we established an assay for the measurement of circulating MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes. A quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed for the measurement of the MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum based on monoclonal antibodies against MASP-2 for coating and anti-ficolin-3 for detection. In addition, we assessed the serum concentrations of ficolin-3 and MASP-2 and the extent of ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition on acetylated BSA in samples from 97 healthy donors. The median concentration of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes was found to be 119.7 AU/ml (range: 2.9-615.5 AU/ml). Significant correlations were found between the level of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes and the concentration of ficolin-3 (Spearman r=0.2532, p=0.0124), and MASP-2 (Spearman r=0.4505, p<0.0001), as well as the degree of C4 deposition (Spearman r=0.671, p<0.0001). When ficolin-3 deficient (homozygous for the rs28357092 polymorphism) and MASP-2 deficient (homozygous for the rs72550870 polymorphism) sera were incubated together, complex formation was induced between MASP-2 and ficolin-3. The complex formation disappeared in the presence of EDTA. An assay allowing quantitative measurement exclusively of MASP-2/ficolin-3 complexes in serum is described. This method may add further insight into the pathophysiology of disorders associated with the deficiency or abnormal activities of MASP-2 and ficolin-3.

To assess the involvement of ficolin-3, the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway (LCP), in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) pathology and outcome. In this preliminary exploratory study, plasma concentration of ficolin-3 and of ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was measured, along with that of other LCP initiators (mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-2, and ficolin-1), C3 activation products, and soluble C5b-9 terminal complex, in a prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and 6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with unfavorable outcome. Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters. These results support the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to control injury progression in SAH.

The human lectin complement pathway (LCP) involves circulating complexes consisting of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins in association with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and a non-enzymatic protein, sMAP. MASP-3 originates from the MASP1 gene through differential splicing and little is known about its biological characteristics. For this reason we expressed recombinant MASP-3 and generated specific monoclonal antibodies to establish biochemical characteristics and to determine the serum levels, the interactions with the LCP recognition molecules and the influence on complement activation of MASP-3. We expressed rMASP-3 in CHO-DG44 cells and used SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for biochemical characterization. We generated monoclonal antibodies against MASP-3 and developed a quantitative MASP-3 assay to establish the serum levels in 100 Danish blood donors. In addition we assessed the association levels between MASP-3 and Ficolin-2, -3 and MBL using both ELISA and immunoprecipitation techniques. Moreover, we assessed the influence on complement factor C4 deposition. We found the mean serum MASP-3 concentration to be 6.4mg/l (range: 2-12.9mg/l) and that MASP-3 in serum is primarily found in complex with Ficolin-3. In contrast to this the MASP-3 association with Ficolin-2 and especially with MBL seems to be less evident. rMASP-3 significantly inhibited Ficolin-3 mediated C4 deposition, while the opposite was the case for rMASP-1. Our results show that MASP-3 is present in relatively high serum concentrations. Moreover, Ficolin-3 is the primary acceptor molecule of MASP-3 among the LCP activator molecules, but MASP-3 appears to down-regulate Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation through the lectin pathway.

Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied 10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was particularly interesting. In individuals heterozygous for the FCN3+1637delC deletion lowered Ficolin-3 concentration was observed (P=0.025). SDS-PAGE and western blotting of serum revealed a weak band corresponding to the truncated molecule in addition to the normal Ficolin-3 pattern. Characterization of recombinant Ficolin-3 derived from FCN3+1637delC showed that in the homozygous situation this allelic variant would lead to Ficolin-3 deficiency. In conclusion an FCN3+1637delC deletion variant disrupting the possibility for pattern recognition was detected. Characterization of recombinant variant Ficolin-3 shows that homozygosity for the FCN3+1637delC deletion may lead to Ficolin-3 deficiency and may thus be the basis for a novel complement deficiency state.

Ficolin-3 (also called H-ficolin or Hakata antigen) is a complement-activating pattern recognition molecule, possessing a fibrinogen-like domain involved in carbohydrate binding. Amongst human ficolins, Ficolin-3 has the highest concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro. Evidence for its physiological function is sparse, although its deficiency has been suggested to increase susceptibility to infections. The specificity of Ficolin-3 is poorly characterized and currently few ligands are known. Here we report agglutination of Hafnia alvei, a Gram-negative enteric commensal bacterium and opportunist pathogen, in the presence of recombinant Ficolin-3 and calcium. Ficolin-3 also augmented phagocytosis of H. alvei by macrophages and displayed bactericidal activity. Additionally, Ficolin-3 inhibited host cells' response to TLR4/MD-2/CD14-LPS dependent NF-κB activation. This is the first demonstration of protective activity of Ficolin-3 against a human bacterial pathogen. Although human Ficolin-3 does not recognise and bind to common pathogenic bacteria, it could be an important component of innate immunity providing protection, for example, from commensal flora that can cause extraintestinal, opportunistic infections.
