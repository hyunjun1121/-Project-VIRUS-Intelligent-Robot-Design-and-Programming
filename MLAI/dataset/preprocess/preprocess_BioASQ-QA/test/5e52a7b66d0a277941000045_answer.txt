IDEAL_ANSWER:
- DeepCpG is a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict methylation states in single cells. By evaluating DeepCpG on single-cell methylation data from five cell types generated using alternative sequencing protocols it turns out that DeepCpG yields substantially more accurate predictions than previous methods.
- DeepCpG is a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict single-cell DNA methylation states in single cells.
