To determine the change in prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in victims of the March 11 attacks and their relatives, 1 and 6 months after the attacks. Evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) in a sample of 56 patients admitted to an emergency room of a general hospital, and assessment of PTSD symptoms in relatives of the patients. At Month 1, 41.1% of patients (31.3% of males and 54.2% of females) presented with PTSD. At Month 6, this figure was 40.9% (30.4% of males and 52.4% of females). There was a significant improvement in perception of health among females between Month 1 and Month 6. Relatives presented similar DTS scores at baseline and at 6 months. We verified that rates of PTSD did not vary substantively between the two evaluations. PTSD symptoms positively correlated with psychological health involvement. This correlation points out that both PTSD symptoms and subjective general health involvement are part of the psychological response to trauma. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was high and remained stable between Month 1 and Month 6, while subjective perception of health improved significantly.

Rates of remission were examined in two controlled 12-week studies of sertraline and placebo for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The performance of three scales was evaluated: the self-rated Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), and two interviewer scales: the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Sertraline proved significantly superior to placebo with respect to remission on all three ratings. Rates of remission were very similar for all scales, ranging from 23.1-26.3% for sertraline and 13.9-14.9% for placebo. Traditional thresholds for the CAPS and DTS were tested relative to the CGI and to each other. The CAPS and DTS thresholds of < 20 and < 18 were found to be valid.

Resilience is defined as the ability to recover from stress. However, all resilience measures with exception of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) assess resources that make resilience possible instead of recovery. The purpose of this study was to translate the BRS to Spanish and to analyze the reliability and validity of its scores. The psychometric properties of its scores were examined in a heterogeneous sample of 620 Spanish adults. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out to study its scores' evidence of structural validity. Besides, to study its scores' evidence of convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in relation to other resilience questionnaires (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale 10-item version, Situated Subjective Resilience Questionnaire for Adults and Resiliency Questionnaire for Adults) and to variables such as emotions (Modified Differential Emotions Scale), coping (Person-situation Coping Questionnaire for Adults), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), correlation and regression analyses were conducted. To study its sensitivity, we assessed the effect of sociodemographics and the ability of the scale to identify high-risk populations by conducting analyses of variance and Pearson correlations. The BRS scores showed adequate reliability (α = .83; intraclass coefficient = .69). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the Spanish version of the BRS is mono-factorial (χ2/df = 2.36; standardized root mean square residual = .036; goodness-of-fit index = .980; comparative fit index = .984; incremental fit index = .984; root mean square error of approximation = .067). They also showed adequate evidence of the scores' convergent, concurrent and predictive validity. The Spanish version of the BRS is a reliable and valid means to assess resilience as the ability to bounce back. (PsycINFO Database Record

Self-report questionnaires are frequently used to identify PTSD among U.S. military personnel and Veterans. Two common scoring methods used to classify PTSD include: (1) a cut score threshold and (2) endorsement of PTSD symptoms meeting DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria (SCM). A third method requiring a cut score in addition to SCM has been proposed, but has received little study. The current study examined the diagnostic accuracy of three scoring methods for the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) among 804 Afghanistan and Iraq war-era military Service Members and Veterans. Data were weighted to approximate the prevalence of PTSD and other Axis I disorders in VA primary care. As expected, adding a cut score criterion to SCM improved specificity and positive predictive power. However, a cut score of 68-72 provided optimal diagnostic accuracy. The utility of the DTS, the role of baseline prevalence, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) there is a need for self-rating scales that are sensitive to treatment effects and have been tested in a broad range of trauma survivors. Separate measures of frequency and severity may also provide an advantage. Three hundred and fifty-three men and women completed the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), a 17-item scale measuring each DSM-IV symptom of PTSD on 5-point frequency and severity scales. These subjects comprised war veterans, survivors of rape or hurricane and a mixed trauma group participating in a clinical trial. Other scales were included as validity checks as follows: Global ratings, SCL-90-R, Eysenck Scale, Impact of Event Scale and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. The scale demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r = 0.86), internal consistency (r = 0.99). One main factor emerged for severity and a smaller one for intrusion. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, and the factor structure more closely resembled the traditional grouping of symptoms. Concurrent validity was obtained against the SCID, with a diagnostic accuracy of 83% at a DTS score of 40. Good convergent and divergent validity was obtained. The DTS showed predictive validity against response to treatment, as well as being sensitive to treatment effects. The DTS showed good reliability and validity, and offers promised as a scale which is particularly suited to assessing symptom severity, treatment outcome and in screening for the likely diagnosis of PTSD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tiagabine in adult patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This 12-week, multicenter, double-blind study randomized patients to receive either tiagabine or placebo. Tiagabine (administered in divided doses) was initiated at 4 mg/d (2 mg BID) and individually titrated of up to 4 mg/d weekly to a maximum dose of 16 mg/d. Assessments included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Clinical Global Impressions of Change, Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale, Davidson Trauma Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. A total of 232 patients (tiagabine, n = 116; placebo, n = 116) were randomized. There were no significant differences in change from baseline in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total score at final visit for tiagabine compared with placebo (P = 0.85). Similarly, no significant differences were observed with tiagabine on the other efficacy outcome measures (described above) compared with placebo. Tiagabine was generally well tolerated and not associated with weight gain, changes in sexual function, or worsening of depressive symptoms. Tiagabine was not significantly different from placebo in the treatment of symptoms of PTSD. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of drugs that target the gamma-aminobutyric acid system in the treatment of PTSD.

This was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of quetiapine monotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Eighty patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either quetiapine or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary efficacy measures included the CAPS subscales, the Davidson Trauma Scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scales for severity of Illness and improvement, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Safety measurements included adverse events, vital signs, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale, and the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale. After a 1-week placebo run-in, quetiapine was started at a daily dosage of 25 mg and increased to a maximum of 800 mg; the average was 258 mg (range, 50-800 mg). Reductions in CAPS total, re-experiencing, and hyperarousal scores were significantly greater for the quetiapine group than for the placebo group. Greater improvements were also observed for quetiapine in scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale, CGI severity and improvement ratings, PANSS positive symptom and general psychopathology subscales, HAM-A, and HAM-D than for placebo. Adverse events were generally mild and expected based on prior studies of quetiapine in this and other patient population. There were no differences in safety measures between groups. Quetiapine monotherapy was efficacious in the treatment of PTSD. These findings suggest quetiapine as a single agent is effective in treating military PTSD.

The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) was developed as a self-rating for use in diagnosing and measuring symptom severity and treatment outcome in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); 630 subjects were identified by random digit dialing and evaluated for a history of trauma. Prevalence rates of PTSD and subthreshold PTSD with impairment were 2.2 and 4.1%, respectively. In this general population sample, 438 subjects endorsed at least one trauma, and four groups were generated: A) threshold PTSD (n = 13), B) subthreshold PTSD with impairment (n = 26), C) subthreshold PTSD without impairment (n = 78), and D) no PTSD (n = 321). Mean (SD) DTS score in the entire population was 11.0 +/- 18.1. Differences were found in four of the five pairwise between-group contrasts. In a second sample of 447 clinical trial participants from three SSRI vs. placebo studies, we assessed treatment effect size according to different measures. In all three clinical trials, effect size with the DTS was equal to, or better than, those found for the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP). These results further affirm the utility of the DTS as a self-rating measure of PTSD symptom severity and in evaluating treatment response.

Previous studies have suggested a link between heart rate (HR) following trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study expands on previous work by evaluating HR in burn patients followed longitudinally for symptoms of acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD. Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Burn Center, Baltimore, Maryland, between 1997 and 2002. Patients completed the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (n = 157) to assess symptoms of ASD. The Davidson Trauma Scale was completed at 1 (n = 145), 6 (n = 106), 12 (n = 94), and 24 (n = 66) months postdischarge to assess symptoms of PTSD. Heart rate in the ambulance, emergency room, and burn unit were obtained by retrospective medical chart review. Pearson correlations revealed a significant relationship between HR in the ambulance (r = 0.32, P = .016) and burn unit (r = 0.30, P = .001) and ASD scores at baseline. Heart rate in the ambulance was related to PTSD avoidance cluster scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. In women, HR in the ambulance was correlated with PTSD scores at 6 (r = 0.65, P = .005) and 12 (r = 0.78, P = .005) months. When covariates (gender, β-blockers, Brief Symptom Inventory Global Severity Index score) were included in multivariate linear regression analyses, ambulance HR was associated with ASD and PTSD scores at baseline and 1 month, and the interaction of ambulance HR and gender was associated with PTSD scores at 6 and 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression results were similar at baseline and 12 months, which included an HR association yet no interaction at 6 months and a marginal interaction at 1 month. While peritraumatic HR is most robustly associated with PTSD symptom severity, HR on admission to burn unit also predicts the development of ASD. Gender and avoidance symptoms appear particularly salient in this relationship, and these factors may aid in the identification of subgroups for which HR serves as a biomarker for PTSD. Future work may identify endophenotypic measures of increased risk for PTSD, targeting subgroups for early intervention.

This study aimed to explore retrospective childhood ADHD symptomatology, psychiatric comorbidity, rates of substance-use disorders (SUD), as well as their association with high-risk health behaviors in prison and adverse health outcomes. A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors. Wald χ(2) tests revealed significant associations of ADHD with MDD and PTSD, as well as increased risk for overdosing and intravenous drug use in prison. A logistic regression model adjusted for mood and anxiety comorbidity predicted lifetime SUD diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.38; 95% confidence interval = [1.15, 4.94]). Our results provide further evidence on the association of drug dependence and ADHD symptoms, and their overrepresentation among prison inmates.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Davidson trauma scale (DTS-S) and to determine the prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a non-clinical random sample of prison inmates. Probabilistic samples of 1,179 inmates from 26 penal institutions in Puerto Rico were selected using a multistage sampling design. Population estimates and correlations were obtained for PTSD, generalized anxiety and depression. The reliability, factor structure, and convergent validity of the DTS-S were assessed. Cross-validation was employed to confirm the results of the factor analyses. Using the cut-offs adopted by the scale's author, 136 (13.4 percent) of the inmates are likely to have current PTSD and 117 (11.6 percent) reach the cut-off for sub-threshold PTSD. Confirmatory factor analysis generated two factors explaining 53 percent of the variance. High reliabilities were obtained for the total scale (α=0.95) and for the frequency and severity scales (α=0.90 and 0.91). Significantly higher DTS-S scores were found for females (t=2.26, p<0.025), for inmates diagnosed with depression or anxiety (t=2.02, p<0.05), and those reporting suicide attempts (t=4.47, p<0.0001). Findings support that the DTS-S is a reliable and valid measure to assess PTSD symptoms in Latino inmate populations and to identify individuals at risk for the disorder that require confirmatory diagnosis and clinical interventions.

Pakistan's 2005 earthquake claimed almost 87,000 lives and displaced millions. The present study sought to assess PTSD prevalence among earthquake survivors, to evaluate its determinants, and to identify protective factors that suggest future interventions in the aftermath of disasters. In a cross-sectional survey, three districts were selected based on their proximity to the epicenter and the presence, accessibility, and security of refugees, 300 earthquake survivors were enrolled. Analysis revealed that after 30months, PTSD prevalence was high. Being female, older, unmarried, head of the family, and currently unemployed and having low income and living in temporary housing confer higher risks of PTSD. Having a high social capital and religious inclination seem to have protective, buffer effect and increase resilience against PTSD. This is the first post-quake study in Pakistan that has utilized, adapted and validated Davidson Trauma Scale in the local context. Results imply the significance of continued psychological support, of drawing on resilience factors in PTSD management. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Empirical data have challenged chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consisting of three dimensions. In the present study we aimed to determine the factor structure of acute posttraumatic symptoms in two recently traumatized samples. In sample 1, 203 civilian trauma survivors were administered the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) approximately 1 week posttrauma. In sample 2, 182 civilian treatment seeking trauma survivors completed the DTS at an average of 41.4 days posttrauma. Our confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a 4-factor intercorrelated model provided the best representation of the data in both samples. The four factors are best described as reexperiencing, active avoidance, dysphoria, and hyperarousal. For acute posttraumatic symptoms, the empirical data suggest to split the avoidance cluster into 'Active avoidance' and 'Dysphoria'-confirming findings in studies on chronic PTSD. In future revisions of the DSM, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD may need to be adapted to fit the research findings.

In this study psychometric properties of seven self-report measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were compared. The seven scales evaluated were the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Civilian Mississippi Scale (CMS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Penn Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Penn), and the PK scale of the MMPI-2 (PK). Participants were 239 (79 male and 160 female) trauma-exposed undergraduates. All seven measures exhibited good test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The PDS, PCL and DTS demonstrated the best convergent validity; the IES-R, PDS, and PCL demonstrated the best discriminant validity; and the PDS, PCL, and IES-R demonstrated the best diagnostic utility. Overall, results most strongly support the use of the PDS and the PCL for the assessment of PTSD in this population.

The Web site for the Anxiety Disorders Association of America (ADAA) receives more than 5 million visits per month and thus represents a unique medium for the study of anxiety disorders. ADAA Web site users from October 2002 to January 2003 were invited to complete a survey oriented toward trauma history and psychiatric sequelae. A diagnostic approximation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was based on responses to the Trauma Questionnaire, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and questions about impairment. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was also used. Variables were tested for their association with PTSD. Among 1558 participants, 87% had a history of trauma, and 38% had current PTSD. The population was comprised predominantly of white middle-class women, half of whom were married. More than 90% were first-time users of the site. Factors associated with PTSD included death of, or harm to, a loved one; personal history of incest, rape, or physical abuse; lower age; lower income; unemployment; missed work; increased medical care; dissatisfaction with psychotropic medication; depressive symptoms; and lower resilience. In this selective convenience sample, there were high rates of traumatization and PTSD. The demographics of this group are similar to those seen in previously studied populations that had contacted the ADAA. Furthermore, the factors associated with PTSD were like those in many community surveys. The ADAA Web site has the opportunity to benefit large numbers of highly distressed individuals.

This report describes the reliability, validity, treatment sensitivity, diagnostic performance and normative values for the Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Rating Interview (SPRINT), a brief, global assessment for PTSD. The SPRINT was administered to subjects participating in a clinical trial of PTSD and in a population survey assessing PTSD prevalence. The 8-item SPRINT includes questions assessing the core symptoms of PTSD, as well as related aspects of somatic malaise, stress vulnerability and functional impairment. Validity was assessed against the MINI structured interview, the Davidson Trauma Scale, Treatment Outcome for PTSD Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Sheehan Stress Vulnerability Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale and Clinical Global Impressions of Severity and Improvement Scales. Good test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity were obtained. The SPRINT was responsive to symptom change over time and correlated with comparable PTSD symptom measures. In victims of trauma, a score of 14-17 was associated with 96% diagnostic accuracy, whereas in those with PTSD, highest efficiency corresponded to a range of 11-13. The SPRINT demonstrates solid psychometric properties and can serve as a reliable, valid and homogeneous measure of PTSD illness severity and of global improvement.

We evaluated the role that selected variants in serotonin transporter (5-HTT), dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes play in PTSD symptom severity in an at-risk population. We also investigated the interaction between the genetic variants to determine whether these variables and the interactions between the variables influenced the severity of PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were quantitatively assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in 150 participants from an at-risk South African population. All participants were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, DRD2 Taq1A and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms. Gene-gene interactions were investigated using various linear models. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, major depressive disorder diagnosis, level of resilience, level of social support and alcohol dependence. A significant interaction effect between DRD2 Taq1A and BDNF Val66Met variants on DTS score was observed. On the background of the BDNF Val66Val genotype, DTS score increased significantly with the addition of a DRD2 Taq1A A1 allele. However, on the BDNF Met66 allele background, the addition of an A1 allele was found to reduce total DTS score. This study provides preliminary evidence for an epistatic interaction between BDNF Val66Met and DRD2 Taq1A polymorphisms on the severity of PTSD symptoms, where both too little and too much dopamine can result in increased PTSD symptom severity.

Co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses have a negative impact on quality of life and change the presentation and prognosis of bipolar disorder (BD). To date, comorbidity research on patients with BD has primarily focused on co-occurring anxiety disorders and trauma history; only recently has there been a specific focus on co-occurring PTSD and BD. Although rates of trauma and PTSD are higher in those with bipolar disorder than in the general population, little is known about differences across bipolar subtypes. Using the NIMH STEP-BD dataset (N=3158), this study evaluated whether there were baseline differences in the prevalence of PTSD between participants with bipolar disorder I (BDI) and bipolar disorder II (BDII), using the MINI and the Davidson Trauma Scale. Differences in PTSD symptom clusters between patients with BDI and BDII were also evaluated. A significantly greater proportion of participants with BDI had co-occurring PTSD at time of study entry (Χ(2)(1)=12.6; p<.001). BDI and BDII subgroups did not significantly differ in re-experiencing, avoidance, or arousal symptoms. The analysis may suggest a correlational relationship between PTSD and BD, not a causal one. Further, it is possible this population seeks treatment more often than individuals with PTSD alone. Finally, due to the episodic nature of BD and symptom overlap between the two disorders, misdiagnosis is possible. PTSD may be more prevalent in patients with BDI. However, the symptom presentation of PTSD appears similar across BD subtypes. Individuals should be thoroughly assessed for co-occurring diagnoses in an effort to provide appropriate treatment.

The serotonergic system is implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The present study focused on platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentration and symptoms of comorbid depression in war veterans with or without PTSD. PTSD and depression were evaluated using Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Davidson Trauma Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Sixty-five male drug-free war veterans (48 with PTSD and 17 without PTSD) and 65 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Comorbid depression occurred in 54 and 31% of war veterans with PTSD and without PTSD, respectively. Platelet 5-HT concentration was similar in the groups of depressed and nondepressed war veterans with or without PTSD and healthy controls. Platelet 5-HT concentration was found to differ between war veterans with various degrees of appetite loss. A positive correlation was observed between platelet 5-HT concentration and severity of appetite loss in veterans with PTSD. There was no relationship between platelet 5-HT concentration and severity of other symptoms of PTSD or depression. War veterans included in the study were outpatients. War veterans with PTSD had a high incidence of comorbid depression, that was not related to platelet 5-HT concentration. The marked relationship between platelet 5-HT concentration and severity of appetite loss, suggested that 5-HT system is involved in the regulation of appetite, at least in depressed war veterans with PTSD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in two patients, one with posttraumatic stress disorder and one with acute stress disorder, before and after treatment, and to compare those levels to those of healthy controls. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor level, Davidson Trauma Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Clinical Global Impression were assessed before and after 6 weeks of treatment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were higher in patients than in matched controls before treatment. After 6 weeks, there was a reduction in symptoms and an improvement in functioning in both cases. At the same time, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels decreased after treatment, even in case 2, treated with psychotherapy only. These results suggest that serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as opposed to what has been described in mood disorders, are increased in posttraumatic stress disorder as well as in acute stress disorder.

The overlap between symptoms of PTSD and MDD is substantial. PTSD symptoms arise after a traumatic experience and the trauma is present in all of the diagnostic clusters. In individuals who have experienced a trauma a long time before, it is difficult to establish the exact moment of onset of their symptoms in relation to the trauma suffered. We proposed to raise awareness among operators who may encounter this problem, with the aim of providing them with valuable help in order to achieve a correct differential diagnosis. A sample of subjects suffering from PTSD without comorbidity was assessed to confirm the diagnosis and the severity of post-traumatic symptoms. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare any modifications in the parameters analyzed through the Davidson Trauma Scale with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms as evaluated by the Hamilton-D scale. Half of the PSTD patients recruited showed values of HAM-D > 18, although an active Major Depressive Episode was clinically excluded. Symptom of "numbing", despite being different from the apathy experienced in depression, is identified as a depressive symptom by the HAM-D. Giving prevalence to depressive symptoms may be misleading for diagnosis and may ultimately result in inappropriate treatment.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has been implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. The present research examined if the ε4 allele of the APOE gene moderated the effect of combat exposure on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. Participants included 765 non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 859 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. A structured interview established psychiatric diagnoses. Combat exposure and PTSD symptom severity were assessed via self-report. The most common lifetime diagnoses were depression (39.2%), PTSD (38.4%), and alcohol dependence (24.38%). After correcting for multiple comparisons, no significant effects were observed on any of the outcomes among the NHW sample; however, within the NHB sample, significant gene × environment (G × E) interactions were observed for lifetime PTSD (P = .0029) and PTSD symptom severity (P = .0009). In each case, the APOE ε4 allele had no effect on the outcomes when combat exposure was low; however, when combat exposure was high, an additive effect was observed such that ε4 homozygotes exposed to high levels of combat reported the highest rates of PTSD (92%) and the worst symptom severity scores on the Davidson Trauma Scale (M = 79.5). Although preliminary, these findings suggest that the APOE ε4 allele, in conjunction with exposure to high levels of combat exposure, may increase veterans' risk for developing PTSD.

The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a validated, 17-item, brief global assessment scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purposes of this study were to develop a Korean version of the DTS (DTS-K) while maintaining its basic structure and to evaluate its reliability and validity for the Korean population. Participants of this study included 93 patients with PTSD (PTSD group), 73 patients with nonpsychotic mood or other anxiety disorders (psychiatric control group), and 88 healthy controls (normal control group). Subjects completed psychometric assessments, including the DTS-K and the Korean version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The DTS-K showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .97) and test-retest reliability (r = .93). The DTS-K showed a significantly positive correlation with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (r = .94). The highest diagnostic efficiency of DTS-K was at a total score of 47, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.84, respectively. Our findings suggest that the DTS-K is composed of good psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable tool for assessing the frequency and severity of PTSD symptoms regardless of ethnicity.

Interest in the psychiatric consequences of trauma and the subsequent surgical intervention has been increasing steadily; therefore, the authors assessed the prevalence of acute symptoms of stress in patients who experienced a craniomaxillofacial injury. Fifty patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years were evaluated and assigned a score using the Injury Severity Scale (ISS). Within 48 hours of surgery (T0) and at 3 months after surgery (T1), the authors administered the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) to assess post-traumatic symptoms, Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess symptoms of anxiety, and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to assess depressive symptoms. Of the subjects, 44% (22 patients at T0) had acute symptoms of stress, and 26% (13 patients at T1) had post-traumatic stress symptoms. The statistical association between demographic variables was significant only for gender, especially for women. There was a significant correlation between the psychopathologic variables and trauma-specific symptoms at both T0 and T1; the same was true for the ISS at T0. Eight of the 13 patients with positive DTS results at 3 months had aesthetic and functional sequelae that might have served as reminders of the traumatic event. It is not only necessary to restitutio ad integrum the anatomy and function, but also to provide psychiatric support for patients experiencing psychiatric symptoms caused by traumatic events.

Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder are a well-recognized phenomenon in mothers of preterm infants, with implications for maternal health and infant outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated 6-month outcomes from a skills-based intervention developed to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. One hundred five mothers of preterm infants were randomly assigned to (1) a 6- or 9-session intervention based on principles of trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy with infant redefinition or (2) a 1-session active comparison intervention based on education about the NICU and parenting of the premature infant. Outcome measures included the Davidson Trauma Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory II, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4 to 5 weeks after birth, and 6 months after the birth of the infant. At the 6-month assessment, the differences between the intervention and comparison condition were all significant and sizable and became more pronounced when compared with the 4- to 5-week outcomes: Davidson Trauma Scale (Cohen's d = -0.74, P < .001), Beck Anxiety Inventory (Cohen's d = -0.627, P = .001), Beck Depression Inventory II (Cohen's d = -0.638, P = .002). However, there were no differences in the effect sizes between the 6- and 9-session interventions. A brief 6-session intervention based on principles of trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy was effective at reducing symptoms of trauma, anxiety, and depression in mothers of preterm infants. Mothers showed increased benefits at the 6-month follow-up, suggesting that they continue to make use of techniques acquired during the intervention phase.

The Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-C) was developed to respond to the need of Chinese-speaking individuals. The DTS is a validated self-rating scale used in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The DTS-C is translated from DTS through a two-stage translation. Subjects were drawn from a sample of 210 survivors of the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi Earthquake. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.97) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.88). Concurrent validity was obtained against the clinical diagnostic interview, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 at DTS-C score of 44. It showed that the sensitivity was 0.9, specificity 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 4.74, and negative likelihood ratio 0.12. The recommended stratum-specific likelihood ratios were 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.20) for the score range 0-39, 4 (2.22-7.23) for the score range of 40-59, and 6.14 (3.42-11.02) for the scores above 60. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, the factor structures closely resembled the DSM-IV grouping of PTSD symptoms. The psychometric strength of DTS-C is reliable for its future use, particularly for screening for subjects with possible diagnosis of PTSD.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become a first line treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a recent double-blind study in civilians, fluoxetine produced clinically and statistically significant effects on all general measures of PTSD. We examined the specific effects of fluoxetine versus placebo in the above mentioned study of PTSD clusters and individual symptoms. Individuals were included if they met criteria for PTSD according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Symptoms were assessed at sequential time points by the Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP), a clinician interview based assessment, and a self-report scale, the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). A total of 53 patients were included in the analysis. On the SIP and DTS, fluoxetine was found to produce statistically significant changes on all clusters. Significant effects for fluoxetine were noted on 10 items of the DTS, and 8 items of the SIP. The SIP and DTS had 6 items in common that were significant. Fluoxetine exerts a broad spectrum effect in reducing all the symptom clusters of PTSD in this sample. The symptoms of being physically upset at reminders of the trauma, avoiding thoughts of the trauma, having difficulty enjoying things, feeling distant/estranged, having a sense of foreshortened future, and impaired concentration, were the symptoms most responsive to the effects of treatment with fluoxetine on both scales.

Emerging data suggest that second-generation antipsychotics such as aripiprazole may be effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few clinical trials have used aripiprazole in PTSD, and data are limited on its use in Veterans with PTSD. The objective of this pilot trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in Veterans with PTSD. Ten individuals (five men and five women) meeting the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th ed., PTSD criteria participated in this 12-week, open-label, flexibly dosed monotherapy trial. The dose range of aripiprazole was 5-30 mg/day, titrated to tolerability and clinical response. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Additional outcomes included the Short PTSD Rating Interview, the Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale (Top-8), the Davidson Trauma Scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen, and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. Eight participants completed the study, and aripiprazole was generally well tolerated and associated with a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (primary outcome measure) and by the Short PTSD Rating Interview, the Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale, and the Davidson Trauma Scale. An improvement was also observed on all three Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales and the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen, and the average Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement ratings indicated that patients were 'much improved'. These promising initial results merit further investigation in a larger, randomized-controlled trial.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of quetiapine for subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who were already on a stable dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) but had significant PTSD symptoms. Fifteen subjects were enrolled in an 8-week open-label trial for PTSD in which quetiapine was added to an SSRI. Subjects were on a stable dose of the SSRI for at least 6 weeks before study entry and had a Clincian-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score of greater than or equal to 50 at study baseline. The mean age of subjects was 49 years (eight men and seven women). The average duration of PTSD was 29 years, one-third of subjects had combat-related PTSD, and two-thirds had noncombat PTSD. The mean dose prescribed in the study was 216 mg per day. The initial median CAPS score was 80, indicating severe PTSD. The addition of a modest dose of quetiapine provided significant relief from PTSD symptoms with a 42% overall improvement in PTSD symptoms based on the CAPS and significant improvement along each dimension of symptoms: re-experiencing (Z=-3.24, P=0.0012), hyperarousal (Z=-3.30, P=0.001) and avoidance (Z=-2.13, P=0.03). Subjects rated themselves as 45% improved on average on the Davidson Trauma Scale and reported a 44% decrease in their level of disability and impairment as reflected by the Sheehan Disability Scale. Subjects with PTSD who had significant PTSD symptoms when on an SSRI benefited from the addition of quetiapine. Patients improved significantly on all three clusters of PTSD symptoms: re-experiencing, hyperarousal and avoidance.

This study examined the accuracy of the 17-item Dutch version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and the four-item SPAN (Startle, Physiological Arousal, Anger and Numbness) to detect survivors at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within the first 2 weeks after the trauma. 203 civilian survivors of recent trauma with relatively mild symptoms completed the DTS a mean of 8.7 days after experiencing trauma. SPAN scores were computed from the DTS. At a mean of 64.6 days posttrauma, 160 respondents were assessed for diagnosis of PTSD with the Structured Interview for PTSD. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the DTS showed good overall screening accuracy (84%). At a cut-off value of 64, the DTS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.70, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.12, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.98. Overall accuracy of the SPAN was good (89%). At a cut-off of 10 the SPAN showed a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.86, a PPV of 0.22, and a NPV of 0.98. The low PPVs were possibly due to the low of prevalence of PTSD in our sample (4.4%). This study shows that both the DTS and the SPAN are comparably accurate in screening early trauma survivors at risk for developing PTSD. The very brief four-item SPAN may be preferred over the longer 17-item DTS especially in settings in which time and resources are limited. Future studies should aim to cross-validate these results in random samples.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Serotonergic (5HT) attenuation of stress sensitivity is postulated from SSRIs' effects in other anxiety disorders, and we studied this in PTSD. Ten patients with PTSD fully recovered on SSRIs (Clinical Global Impression Scale-I 1 and 2) were enrolled in the study. Patients were tested on two occasions 1 week apart; in each session, they received a drink containing large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) either with (sham tryptophan depletion [STD], control) or without (acute tryptophan depletion [ATD]) tryptophan. At 5.5 hours after the drink, subjects were exposed to a trauma-related exposure challenge. Self-reports of PTSD (visual analogue scales [VAS] and the Davidson Trauma Scale [DTS]), anxiety (Spielberger State Inventory [STAI] Form Y-1), and mood (Profile of Mood States [POMS]) were obtained. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were also measured. The trauma-related exposure challenge induced anxiety on both days, with more marked responses on the ATD day according to VAS, DTS, POMS, and DBP (p < .05). A trend of significance (.1 > p > .05) was observed for STAI Form Y-1, HR, and SBP. These data demonstrate that ATD accentuates responses to trauma-related stimuli in SSRI-recovered PTSD. They also suggest that SSRI-induced increases in serotonin function restrain PTSD symptoms, especially under provocation, supporting a role for serotonin in mediating stress resilience.

Survivors of acute respiratory failure commonly experience long-term psychological sequelae and impaired quality of life. For researchers interested in general mental health, using multiple condition-specific instruments may be unnecessary and inefficient when using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF)-36, a recommended outcome measure, may suffice. However, relationships between the SF-36 scores and commonly used measures of psychological symptoms in acute survivors of respiratory failure are unknown. Our objective is to examine the relationship of the SF-36 mental health domain (MH) and mental health component summary (MCS) scores with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) evaluated using validated psychological instruments. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,229 participants at 6- and 12-month follow-up assessment using data from five studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, the Davidson Trauma Scale, Impact of Event Scale (IES), and IES-Revised (IES-R). At 6-month assessment there were moderate to strong correlations of the SF-36 MH scores with HADS depression and anxiety symptoms (r = -0.74 and -0.79) and with IES-R PTSD symptoms (r = -0.60) in the pooled analyses. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). Negative predictive values were high. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the SF-36 MH score was high for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (0.88, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively). All results were consistent for the MCS, across the individual studies, and for the 12-month assessment. For researchers interested in general mental health status, the SF-36 MH or MCS offers a strong measure of psychological symptoms prevalent among survivors of acute respiratory failure. For researchers interested in specific conditions, validated psychological instruments should be considered.
